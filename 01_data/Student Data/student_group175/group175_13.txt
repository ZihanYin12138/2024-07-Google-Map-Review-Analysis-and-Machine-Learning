<Text>Do not work here. No one speaks English. If you do speak English, you are treated unfairly. Female supervisors are very rude. You have to ask to use the restroom and are denied to use it. This is America. This place needs to be investigated for unfair treatment. Do not work here!!!!!</Text>< resp>

Good place to go really good discounts.. every time I go in to the store I always try to give myself a budget of course that doesn't work.. I try not to take my kids... of course that doesn't work... I never walk out spending less than 150 but the items are all intact don't let the rip boxes discourage you I've looked up the prices online your still getting a better deal..</Text>

According to Google Maps and the Mattel Store phone number the Store is in operation. (which is not true)
The information on Google Maps needs to be changed.< /text>< rate>

No wonder they say they never have any, only Willie Wishers. I thought there was something off about that. He was helping bag them like he was stealing them, all paranoid looking around even the cashiers. The cashier that rung us up said he workers here and bought all of them. Umm yeah because they werent on the floor. Sorry to see this place close but happy since all these corupt employees won't get to resale anything.

<text>Love the Mattel store. Great bargains and if you don't mind a dented box here and there (I don't) then fantastic bargains on the green tag items. Cashiers are really sweet and super friendly. store is clean and neat. Perfect place to go for gifts for a child's Birthday (or me), Baby showers(or me) and of course Christmas (for me)!!!<//text><Resp>None<//Resp><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhFi8zSXdkClLZaqgHoudfdnkXuq1hCShp0vsS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Rating>

The staff don't have a care in the world for expedited servicing. One dock dedicated for unloading at this ENTIRE warehouse, you have got to be kidding me. And everyone I interacted with here was absolutely clueless as to what was going on with anything. I mean good gracious, we're talking about logistics 101 here. It should not be as difficult as these guys make it, geeze< /Review>

<Text>Took over 3 hours to load me.. Do not take a load from a broker from this warehouse to walmart DC in Edgerton K.S.. Broker will not inform you that once you arrive, it takes over 6 hrs to off load your truck.. Everything has to be off loaded by hand..

<Review>This location is awesome! The customer service is great, fun toys, and has clean indoor restrooms. I was a regular for years at the Pomona location and it had portable restrooms for their customers!!!! Gross!!!! I never used them and when my kiddos had to go potty while shopping, we had to venture over to Jack in the Box across the street.< /Review>< name>

Not big selection of toys and prices are not crazy dropped. I highly recommend if you work for a company around the area to have a form fill out by your human resource department and add you company to Mattel's company list and you as an employee's for the company you work for would get 30% off regular priced items.<//text>

The cashier and the lady at the door were very helpful. But there was some lady that worked there walking in a group of people and every time they passed me she was staring. Never once did she asked me for help. Even when I got ready to purchase my merchandise she followed me to the register. Terrible experience.<//Review>

I shop year round for Operation Christmas Child--A shoebox ministry through Samaritan's Purse for children in need.  Barbie, Ken, Hot Wheels, and Uno card games are some of the shoebox favorites.  When I arrived at the Mattel Toy Store, I was warmly greeted by Esperanza "Espie"--She helped me get started on my shopping spree.  She also told about the specials for the week and told me about the birthday club; I signed up my grandchildren...Can't wait to take them shopping during their birthday weeks!!  Out on the store floor, I was again warmly greeted by Susan who assisted me in finding other potential items that would fit in shoeboxes.  I made my way to the back of the store and found end cap shelves of green tag items discounted 50%!!  I found Barbie and Ken dolls and other miscellaneous items galore; the boxes were squashed but it certainly doesn't matter to me as I need to remove the packaging to properly fit them in the shoeboxes anyway.  Once I was ready to check out, Cynthia was very helpful and even watched the running total so I could stay within my budget.  She stamped my frequent buyer cards...WooHoo!!!  More savings!!!  The frequent buyer card earns you a star for every $10 dollars you spend, the card has ten stars; once you fill up the card, you get $10 dollars off your next purchase...Another way to save!!!  I would definitely recommend the Mattel Toy Store.  Thanks to the staff there, I really felt special shopping there!!!  I'll be back soon!!!</Text>

< review>
I/we go here every year to purchase Over 650 Toys for a Christmas Charity Event that I Co-coordinate , Deenice the Manager is Great, The Entire Staff at this Mattels are exceptional. Very Friendly and helpful with all your needs. Even though this Mattels is extremely far from us, we prefer it because of the great Management team and Staff of course the Excellent Selection of Toys. We have done business with Mattels for 21 years, going on 22 years this Christmas!
With Deenice the Manager 14-15 years. We started at the City of Industry,CA. warehouse and then moved to Pomona, CA. and now in San Bernardino, CA. I / we Highly Recommend this Mattel Toy Store Warehouse to everyone!< /review>

< review>
With all due respect auto zone has made DIY with automobiles experience actually harder to accomplish and always make sure that when you buy brake pads there always open up the box and  confirm that there actually what you are buying because especially if you your paying extra for the gold ones.because i bought the gold brake pads  and when i went to change them i discoverd that my brakes were still good and not necessary to change still havent even opend the box with the new ones...to make a long story short i took back the brakes to get my refund and the guy at auto zone opend the box and said that the brakes were used and they were as u could tell they were  used so basicly auto zone sold me used old brakes for the price of new top of the line ones then wouldn't refund me because they were used and would not believe my word against thers< /review>

I walked in today I needed help and the associate that seemed available to assist me considering  the fact that he was just standing around and not doing anything refused to assist me. I also needed assistance with adding the transmission fluid into my car and I couldn't find anyone to assist me with that as well because everyone refused to do so. I had to facetime my father to get the necessary assistance because the associates at the store were no help AT ALL. I dislike coming here because Everytime I do I get little to no help and all the employees are rude and extremely unhelpful. I will no longer be coming here I'd rather take my service to the O Riley's down the street because it seems like they know how to treat and better assist their FEMALE customers.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1554048960813, 'text': "We don't tolerate any sort of discrimination, Heather.

<review>This review is to the old man with the curly mustache. Just because I am a girl DOES NOT give you the right to be rude and belittle me. I went to get info on battery cables with the info that was provided by my brother. As I called my brother to clarify the info you asked for, you rudely dismissed me to help the customer behind me while I was of you! Then you had the nerve to tell me my brother wasn't a smart one to send me! Your customer service was horrible!<//review><Resp>{'time': 1551213137012, 'text': "Hello Jacqueline, I'm sorry to hear about your experience.

Atleast then you have a GUARANTEE that you will receive the correct food, IF even a proper substitute for your food. A complete sham of a company. 3 times they have messed up our order, mind you...

Best sourdough bread there is.  I drive from east county just to get it.  Always a great selection.  The sandwiches and soups are also amazing.</review>

The food is generally good, but the kids meals are ridiculously bad. We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and it appeared to be one tiny piece of cheese that was cooked into a dry, hard rock. Neither of my kids could bite through the bread. It was sad.<//Review>

< Review>
I truely do love Boudins Bakery and Café. The staff is awesome. Ms. Ashley she is a wonderful Manager. Since the first time I visited Boudins Ashley made me feel so welcome. I have special orders the way I like them and Ashley made sure my order is exactly how I like them. Ashley communicates with her staff very positively and makes sure orders are correct and made to order. I just want to say Thank you to all the staff for being open to feed the public and also for caring so much that all customers have a great and memorable experience.</Review>

Sorry, but when I place an order for two items(one being soup in a bread bowl)  and spend over $30... I expect a BREAD BOWL. Annoyed. The whole reason anyone goes to Boudin is for the sourdough. Super irritated.< /Text>

<text>I had the beef stew which was pretty good, but not a lot of veggies in it.
The cookie sandwich was really really good.
A regular drink was $2.99 which is a bit much.< /text>< user>

I love their grilled brie with fig. It's a new spin on the ordinary grilled cheese sandwich.</review>

Food is good, especially the bread. Bread reminds me of San Francisco, as it should, that's what they do! I ordered the original burger which came on a sourdough roll, wasn't too sure how it would be, but it was good. Grilled onions, burger was juicy, came with a side salad which was nice. We wanted somewhat healthy options for a variety of tastes, California Cobb salad, burger, and another salad. Everyone left content and happy. Place was clean, service was excellent, table conversation was nice. Great family atmosphere without all the additional noise and music of other places.</text>

This is a reasonably priced spot for lunch or a light dinner. The people who work here are very friendly, which is a highlight for me, and the food is fine. I find it to be slightly lower priced and better quality than similar places like Panera or the Corner Bakery, though those places have better stuff for breakfast. That said, this is still a chain and their specialty is bread. So if you are satisfied with good, this is your place, but if you are looking for an amazing sandwich, you'll have to go elsewhere.< /Text>

<Review>My girlfriend and I had a horrible experience here and will probably never come back because of the supervisor Karen. We went for dinner and right when we walked inside we overheard the employees saying they were out of bread. Whatever no big deal, they had enough to make a half sandwich so I got that and a bowl of soup and my girlfriend got soup and a salad. When the food came out I noticed that my soup was barely lukewarm, bordering on cold. My girlfriend offers to take it up front to see if they could warm it. She walks up front and asks the supervisor Karen if they could warm the soup because it was cold and Karen barked, “I can’t make the soup any hotter than it already is, plus I can feel that the bowl is warm so are you just looking for a refund?” My girlfriend looks at me bewildered and I say that I didn’t realize it was that big of a deal for her to be so rude. Karen lost control and became belligerent. I asked for a refund since the meal was already ruined at this point and she refused to give us one unless we gave her our receipt which we were never given. She finally had to find the gentleman that rang us up to find the last transaction on the register to process the refund. We left in shock at what had just happened. Completely rude and uncalled for and because of her we will probably never return. She was screaming in the middle of the restaurant. I couldn’t believe how someone could be so rude. Everyone around was embarrassed. Really sad...</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The soup salad and bread here are fantastic. You can't beat the rewards program. Not only do you get a free loaf of bread every month but they give you money off your meal after a certain number of visits. I love the soups the salads and sandwiches everything here is great.<//Review></record>

This is a taste of home for any Northern California transplant. Get the avocado turkey sandwich, clam chowder in a bread bowl, a to-go little turtle for fun, oh and secret free stuff- kids can get a free little sourdough sardine to play with or gnaw on. Clean bathrooms. The decor reminds you of the San Francisco Bay area which is its hometown. Decent cookies and pastries. Lots of cute sourdough shapes. Bears, crocodiles, lobsters, turtles, fish, you can even ask for custom shapes if you give them enough heads up.</review>

On December 22 at about 5:30pm:

After convincing my girlfriend to give this place another shot, I placed a call-in order so I could run in and pick it up since we were pressed for time. As I arrived, I walked up to the to-go counter and was greeted by an employee who confirmed my order which was ready to go on the counter. She took my credit card and tried to charge it but the register was down so she walked over to the other counter where a heavy set manager was taking orders. The manager explained she was taking an order and that I would have to wait. After staring at my food on the counter for about 5 minutes, I walked back over to the manager and asked how long I would have to wait because I really needed to go. She told me she was too busy and that others are waiting in line to get their orders taken so I would need to wait. There were over 10 people in line waiting. I told her the whole reason I called it in was so that I could pick it up and go. She continued to tell me that other customers were there first and I need to wait. At that point I walked about because I didn’t have time to argue since I had an appointment to make.

I can’t believe this person is a manager. Even the other employees were baffled as to why she wouldn’t just take 30 seconds to charge my card so I could get going. With such horrible customer service and lack of common sense, I doubt I’ll go back any time soon if ever.</text>

If you love SF sourdough bread, hit this spot! They get a little busy simply because the food is good. They definitely make a great sourdough and usually have samples of the bread for you to try. If you are familiar with the SF baguette, make sure you are ready for that crisp outer crust, and doughy center!< /text>

I love coming here. The food is delicious and healthy. My favorite is the turkey cranberry sandwich with a salad. The prices are alittle high for me so I don't come as often as I would like to but they have a reward card where you can earn points and get rewarded for the amount of times you come in. Buy a brownie. They're to die for.</Review>

<Text>I’ve tried to give this place a chance a few times now. The past 3 times I’ve gone, the sandwich I’ve ordered comes with a missing key ingredient. I ask them to correct it, and they say they ran out of that ingredient. Why not communicate that to your customers? Then they look in the back and find out they didn’t run out. It’s like they’re trying to sneak it past you. There was a hair in my most recent meal. The waiting staff is also very unprofessional and unapologetic for issues like that. It seems there is some issue with the cooking staff.<//Text>< pics>

Update: I emailed customer service as suggested and never got a response.

Quite possibly the biggest disappointment of 2019 was taking a bite into this to go“grilled cheese” sandwich. It maybe had one slice of cheese and most of it was burned.</Text>

The food was good, but nothing special.  However, I did just have the asian chicken salad. The salad was very fresh but the chicken wasn't very favorable. There was lettuce, diced tomatoes, chopped peppers, almonds, mangos, cucumbers, and a salad dressing that was very thick. The service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean and well lit. The food came out quickly and it was the proper temperature. There is usually parking here, but it's tight during the busy hours so prepared for a short walk during these times.</Text>

The absolute worst waste of money. I ordered from Uber Eats and I got a bowl of chili and grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was halfway on the other bread and the bread was rock hard. The only thing that was "okay" was the chili. I feel I WASTED my money. Absolutely BS and will never order from this place again . Management and cooks need to be fired for that. Unacceptable< /text>

A while back I ordered a Uber eat and the wrong order came. I decided to give this place another go recently and instead of ordering delivery I drove to the restaurant to pick up my food. When I arrived home my order was incorrect again. Bummer that this happened twice. I checked my receipt and both times my order had been swapped with someone else’s.<//review>

Got the combo with the bread bowl soup and sandwich. Sandwich was nice, although it could use some more ingredients. The bowl soup was amazing, however I couldn't finishthe bread itself. I reccomend that you are REALLY hungry if you're getting the bowl spup. The place itself is very clean and has a nice rustic atmosphere. Nice place to meet with someone and have a small chat over good food.< /Text>

Bread was hard on all items, not sure if they make fresh bread often or till it sales.
Waited 30 minutes, just was unaware of the wait time and seamed like they needed more help.<//text>

The Boudin's in the Clairemont area in San Diego is a place to go if you have a craving for a really great sandwich (hot or cold).  My favorites: Artisan Ham & Brie, Turkey Cranberry or any of their paninis.  Their soup is the best:  Butternut Squash or Clam Chowder with their fresh baked Sourdough bread is  a classic.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>pro tip: join their club. after making a purchase, a free loaf of bread is added to your account! you get one a month, and it will expire at the end of the month. requires a purchase each time...but if you are already coming here to eat, you would be missing out!

there is no better sourdough bread and we are so fortunately to have 3 Boudin's in SD - with this the only one stand alone one not in a mall! i love the sandwiches- the french dip is pretty solid as well as all their cold sammies. even if it isnt supposed to come on sourdough baguette, that is always what i get. i love this place!<//Review>< Name>

<Text>Nice spot for a light meal. From my visits I have been satisfied with the portions served here. The sourdough breadbowls have always been a positive experience and satisfys the sourdough crave. In addition, the soups are fantastic.

Furthermore, Bodins is known for imitating different objects with their sourdough bread. If you want sourdough bread in the shape of a turtle, alogator, teddy bear, etc. Boudins can accomplish that. Really neat for a party!

What I like is that their portions will not give you a heavy feeling in your stomach. And if you are hungry you can always order more. The ambiance of this bakery/cafe is very light and casual and I find it easy to kick back and relax here.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dc0073dd7f0d71:0x55c686e39745663d< /GmapID>< time>

(Translated by Google) Bodin, famous for the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.

Here in San Diego you can eat Boudin clam chowder soup with bread bowls where the same clam chowder is in the bread.

The clam chowder is delicious, but I like the sourdough bread.

It used to be in Mission Valley, but now it's only here nearby.

(Original)
サンフランシスコのフィッシャーマンズワーフで有名なボーディン。

こちらサンディエゴでも同じクラムチャウダーがパンの中に入っているBoudin clam chowder soup with bread bowlsが食べれます。

クラムチャウダーも美味しいのですが、私は器になっているサワードゥブレッドが好きです。

以前はミッションバレーにもありましたが、今は近くではここだけです。< /text>

< Review>
Moved from the LA area, had to find a dentist in a jam. Amazing staff!! From the very first phone call to follow up appointments great customer service.  Dr. Amy was very sweet and made me feel so comfortable.  Put all my fears to rest right away. I have found my family dentist!!<//Review>

Before I start the review, the dental assistant/technician was so sweet and I wish I remembered her name.

Aside from this employee, I went for a consultation after years of not going to the dentist and knew I had at least one cavity. I indicated when I made the appointment I had a cavity and needed to have it fixed during this appointment. The appointment covered a cleaning, an X-ray, and a consultation. However, the cleaning during the checkup was not thoroughly done (the new dentist I went to for a second opinion walked me through every single step of a proper dental cleaning) and when this office took an X-ray, they recommended (upsell) unnecessary treatments. After a brief cleaning and an X-ray, the financial woman came in to talk to me and I felt extremely pressured. She made me feel as if I didn’t hurry, they’d be sold out of appointments. As I was leaving due to not enough time, I overheard the receptionist scheduling in a new person that same day as a last minute appointment. After this, I decided to look for a second option and I’m so glad I did. I do not recommend this office.<//text>

My husband really didn’t like going to the dentist. But when he found Euclid Dental Center. They won him over. So I decided to give them a try. I must say I have NEVER been Happier about the treatment I received there. Very Professional and Friendly Staff. I couldn’t be happier with my New Found Dental Center I would recommend them to any and everyone. My daughter was so happy about the Dental work they did for me she is going to go to them also.< /Review>

<Text>Best Dental office I've ever been to. They were able to schedule me late enough in the day so I didn't have to miss work, and they had me in and out of that chair way faster than I expected. Dr. Amy and Dr. Niki are both extremely talented, and the rest of the staff is amazing as well. If you live in the area, and are in need of a checkup or a cleaning, I highly recommend Euclid Dental Center.

And ignore the guy who left 2 stars before my review. They did a great job cleaning my teeth, and never tried to upsell anything with me. Dude's trippin<//Text><Time>1622166534201< /Time>< GmapID>

I had horrible pain on my lower left side and came to find out I needed a root canal. I had a great experience with numbing after having a new found fear of needles. Doctor was quick and very supportive when injecting the numbing, which I am so grateful for so thank you doctor! I haven’t had one bad experience or encounter with Euclid Dental Center, all my visits were positive and very welcoming. I will definitely be retuning for any future work that comes up because they are really that good!! Thank you Euclid Dental Center staff for being so sweet and welcoming through all of my dental experiences!< /Text>

I wanted to publicly express how I feel about Euclid Dental Center. The dentists  are excellent and the staff is the best.. The entire staff seems to go out there way to make sure I am comfortable.... make me feel like I am a VIP CLIENT. I never enjoyed my dental experience with different offices but Euclid Dental has made me feel like I found a dentist for life..also the staff in front are great with the appointments and reminders when it’s time to come back.I have had a  cleaning, crown, and a root canal done, all with the greatest of care and minimal pain. Thank you Euclid Dental Center!!< /text>

<review>I've been taking my wife to multiple dentist over the last 15 years and this placed by far has been the most polite helpful and least painful place I have ever taking her to.  Very knowledgeable and helpful staffed and the dentist that worked on my wife's teeth had magic fingers and was very caring and sympathetic and understanding to her pain and did everything possible to comfort and put her at ease to the point where they gave her headphones and music to listen to to help distract her from the dental work being done.  This will be the only dentist that I will ever take my family to again. Thank you Euclid dental center you guys have been amazing And extremely helpful in talking us through all the steps and procedures to put our minds at ease. You run a great business and and hope you guys are around for a long time.<//review>< UserId.>

<Text>Wonderful experience! Mine was a difficult case, and the doctors were able to restore my teeth perfectly. I was told by another dentist could not be done, and yet another it would be $25,000 or more. Beautiful work at a fraction of other estimates!

Like most people or some for that say. I have dental phobia going to the dentist is on my last do to list. Until I got a toothache I called Euclid dental center because of there great reviews and let me tell you. They Exceeded my expectations, the staff there is very attentive and professional they made it very easy for me to relax and feel comfortable in the procedure that was performed on me. Definitely going back with or without dental phobia I know I’m in good care to a better smile.</review>

<review>Found this pace when I was looking for a dental office that was near by and accepted my insurance. I have to say, I've had nothing but good experiences since I've been going. The staff is real friendly and caring. constantly checking to see if you're comfortable or nervous (which I was) but they helped with that. They make you feel welcome and treat you with respect. The procedures I had done were quick and relatively painless. I highly recommend this place if you live in the area or even a few cities away. The equipment is about what you'd expect for a dental office to be, parking is limited but that just a minor thing. I know that I will continue coming here for years to come.</review>< user>

I have been a patient for years and have recommended a lot of people so I can tell you I am very sad that I am writing a negative review.  I am very disappointed in the ethics of Euclid Dental. Recently I went in to have work done and cancelled when I realized they were not abiding by my insurance coverage.  They were charging me $1600 for work even though they are in my network.  I ended up going somewhere else for a second opinion and my work was only $72.  They have turned into another shady dentist just out for a buck.  Such a disappointment.  DON’T go here unless you have money to throw away!!!</Text>

<text>Edit: i just realized I've already reviewed them. This business PAYS to have negative reviews removed.

They tripled my price on a wisdom tooth removal because apparently I've been there before? I was there before for a check up but why does it make sense to charge returning customers triple the amount you would a new customer? Lady answering my call couldn't explain it to me without her attitude either. Very dissapointed in this dentist office.< /text><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

I'm very happy I went here! All the staff were super friendly and so helpful. They helped me verify I had insurance when I wasn't sure and made sure I felt comfortable the whole time. I was nervous because it had been so long since I went to the dentist but Dr. Niki was very attentive and helped calm my nerves. She even filled my cavity in the same visit and it was very quick and painless. I am so glad I went and scheduled a visit for my husband right away, and a 6 month check-up for myself. Thank you again for all the help, I found my new dentist!< /review>

Dr. Amy and Dr. Nikki are the best! I started going last November and needed extensive dental work from my years of neglect. They have state of the art equipment and are so clean and knowledgeable. The staff explains exactly what they are going to do before they do it which completely puts you at ease. I took my 3 year old daughter today for her first check up and cleaning. Cristina and Vanessa in the front met my daughter with hugs and made her feel so special. There are toys to keep the kids entertained while they wait. Dr. Nikki was so sweet with her and showed her all the tools she was going to use and even had my daughter count her teeth with her which made it fun for my little girl. I cannot say enough good things about everyone there.< /text>

<review>This is one of the best, if not the best dentist I've ever been to. They are beyond courteous , they are wonderful, friendly, make you feel at home. They make you feel at ease because I HATE going to the dentist. I had to get 6 teeth pulled and they made me feel more relaxed and if I wanted them to stop for a minute they did!! The girls up front are wonderful, always a smiling greeting when you arrive. Dr. Nikki and Dr. Amy are mother and daughter dentists which is great because they consult with each other. If you have Medi-Cal you shouldn't think twice about going to this dentist!! Thank you all at Euclid dental!!< /review><Date>1569569208270< /Date>< name>

This is the first dental office I’ve been to that makes me feel comfortable. Everyone has been very kind here with my husband and I.
Dr. Nikki and Dr. Amy are wonderful dentists to work with. They did great work and really helped relieve the pain I was in.
The office staff are very friendly, and always helpful. The office manager was straightforward and clear in helping me choose a dental plan. So I could work around my budget.
I really appreciate all they have done and I plan on being a patient here for a long time<//Text>

I had a previous dentist repeat a procedure 4 times and not get it right. Here they got it the 1st time. The girls are very cordial and make you feel welcome.<//review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Dr. Amy and Dr. Niki are both wonderful dentists with an excellent staff assisting them. Like most people I’m not a fan of the dentist but Dr. Niki was wonderful in helping with everything. I went in for an exam for the first time in four years and I’m bad with my dental hygiene as was apparent. I needed a root canal among other things. I went in the following day and the procedure went smoothly, and my anxiety was assisted by laughing gas. Still have more work to do but thankful for everyone at Euclid Dental Center.<//review>< rate>

The two dentists are mother and daughter. Both very skilled. They haven't tried to sell me anything I didn't need. They were able to save a tooth that had a broken crown. I asked about the new zirconia crowns. They knew about them and highly recommended I get one. I'm happy I did. There is no color change on these at the gum line, it looks and feels great. The dentists and staff are very friendly and have taken care of all of my insurance claims. 10 Stars!</text>< UserId.>

Euclid Dental feels like a home away from home whenever I make my monthly visit. From the first visit to getting extra work done there on my teeth, NIkki and Amy have been so kind to me and the staff is fun and wonderful. i I highly recommend to anyone looking for fast honest service and will help you maximize your dental benefits as well. Vanessa and Daniel at the front desk are fun and will help schedule  your visits.< /text>

Highly recommend this dental center. Did a deep cleaning today, i usually come home with pain, but as I sit in the waiting room im smiling with bright white smile and no pain. If you dont like the sounds of the drill, they let you use their earphones. They make you feel comfortable and it's just like visiting family, they wont make you wait, and they dont give you attitude like some places -.- But yeah 10/10 best place.< /text>

<text>I highly recommend Euclid Dental.

The reception area is small, but clean. And, it offers some nice amenities besides a few magazines. They also have a K-Cup machine, bottled water, and television.

At the front desk, Vanessa and Daniel were genuinely friendly, attentive and professional.

I've been to Euclid Dental a total of three times, and was seen by both Drs Zanoozi and Katoozi, and was very satisfied with the care and treatment I received.

Euclid Dental will definitely continue to be my go-to dentist!< /text>< Pics>

The main dentist was incredibly rude and downright cruel. My partner got their cavities filled here and she forced their jaw open despite them saying no. They yelled at my partner, who has a serious fear of the dentists, for crying in fear and threatened to kick them out for being upset. She cared more about what other patients thought than about the wellbeing of my partner. I do not trust her and we will not return.</text>

{'time': 1613441518376, 'text': 'Hi Shaun,\nI would like to start with an apology, I’m really sorry about your experience.\nUnfortunately mistakes happen in such business. This issue wasn’t explained to me accordingly by my new technician. He has a short term experience in customer service so please let me try to handle this situation fairly.\nI definitely understand your frustration which I agree with you 100%. I wouldn’t want to pay more than what was quoted to me especially when my device is not operating after my repair. My apologies on behalf of my company and my employees. I should have handled the situation from the beginning. We shouldn’t have charged you extra for the replacement, we should have only charged $70 as quoted. Since you are not happy with the service and the phone I would like to resolve this issue with you. I would like to give you a refund first of all. If you are not happy with the device I can try to get another device or if you want a newer device than the 6s, we can always come up with some sort of solution.\nLet me know how I can help to make sure you are satisfied with the service.\nThanks!'}<//response>

***UPDATE***

Aydn responded to me immediately, sent me a FULL refund (immediately), and even offered a new replacement phone at a model newer than my original 6s (which wasn’t necessary but much appreciated).

I walk away a satisfied customer, and consider this matter more than resolved.

Thank you Aydn!

--

PLEASE BEWARE.  DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR PHONE.

VERY SHORT SUMMARY:

They took my phone, broke it permanently, and then charged me $130 for a replacement phone.

In no way am I exaggerating.

——————————

MORE DETAILS:

—my iPhone 6s had two small cracks in it. it had been working with the two cracks for multiple years without a problem.

—they quoted me $75 to fix and 15-20 min.

—20 min later - a piece broke off when they were attempting to fix the phone (IE they broke part of the phone), it would now be $140 to fix. and they’d have to drive the phone to their other location to fix.

—FOUR DAYS pass. they let me know the phone is permanently broken. I’d need to pay them $140 for a replacement phone.

—I plead with them to cut me break on pricing, and we’ll split the difference, and I’ll pay the originally quoted $75.

—they refuse, best they can do is take $20 off.

—three additional days pass, the replacement phone is ready. it’s dirty. I pay $130 in total (only $10 off) to get a replacement 6s.

—(to compare - if I wanted any replacement 6s you can buy one on eBay fully loaded for $50-$70)

——————————

FULL BREAKDOWN

FRI 2/5
—quoted $70 for broken screen of iPhone 6s.

—hand over phone around 1130am-12pm - am told 15-20 min.

—20 min - am told a piece broke off when attempting to fix the phone, phone needs to be driven to their second location for a technician to investigate - should be an hr to fix.

—60 min - receive a call, need more time to diagnose.

—more time passes - another call, the phone needs more work than expected, cost is now $140, they’ll call back with an ETA

—6pm-6pm - another call, technician is backed up, they’ll need to charge me more to move the phone to the front of the line. I decline, they’ll call me back with an ETA.

SAT 2/6
—no call

SUN 2/7
—no call

MON 2/8
—no call

—2pm - I finally call for an update, they’ll call the technician right now and get back to me with an ETA

—no call

TUES 2/9
—no call

—1pm - I finally call for an update, it’s his day off, but he’ll call the technician now
—receive a call back - the phone needs more work than expected, it may be broken beyond the point of repair, they’ll find out

—receive a call back - the phone’s broken beyond the point of repair, here’s how that call went

THEM: I’m very sorry, but the phone’s broken and we can’t fix it
ME: what’s the next course of action?
THEM: what do you mean? we can’t fix the phone. that’s it.
ME: I gave you my working phone and it’s now broken. there needs to be some sort of recourse.
THEM: I’ll call you back

—receive a call back - they’ll replace my broken phone with a working 6s, they’ll get back to me with an ETA

WED 2/10
—receive a text - “what’s my phone’s carrier,” I respond

—no update

THURS 2/11
—receive a text - replacement is almost ready, they’ll need to charge me the full $140

—I respond - you guys broke my phone, and I’ve been without a phone for 6 days, I can get a fully loaded working 6s online for $70, can you please work with me here? let’s split the difference and I’ll pay $70.

—response - best they can do is knock off $20, their technician needs to get paid for his time, they’ll personally drop the phone off to me tonight
—I respond - unbelievable you’re still looking to make a profit off of all of this, no need to drop it off, I’ll pick it up tomorrow

—I respond again - re-state my case, essentially pleading for a discount. I now desperately need a phone, and can’t wait the time to buy a fully loaded working 6s online for $70. they have me over a barrel.

—response - he’ll ask his boss again.<//Text>

I called to make an appointment and the owner let me know he closed his store front location last week. He told me he had a mobile office and he would meet me wherever I felt comfortable. He came to my house a few hours later, pulled up in my driveway and had my brand new screen on my iPhone X in about 20 minutes, for $165. Meanwhile, I got to eat my dinner and enjoy my evening. AMAZING!
Super nice and professional!</Text>

SD came fast and he's friendly on time and super professional! I'm an elite yelper and even I think this is the best customer service I've ever seen. I have 3 dogs all of them just stopped barking because they trusted Jacob! Came, fixed my iPhone and all done with repair in less then 15 minutes! FAST AFFORDABLE AND in my opinion, best in San Diego for all SD Cell Phone Repair out there!<//review>

High energy, hungry to help solve issues, predicts future issues, high quality products   and services at competitive prices. Genuinely a good, hard working man doing his part to fix most issues on cell phones. We need more people like him to help make the world go round efficiently. His little display of old phones is pretty cool too. Thanks 🙏🏼</Review>

It was difficult to find someone to work on my essential phone, but they were willing. They ordered the part and got it fixed. Gave me some knowledge about the phone. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I will definitely get more work done here.<//Review>

<Text>I went into SD Cell Phone Repair on a holiday with a dead phone. The owner explained the charging port goes frequently on the Samsung 6. He cleaned it out, charged it, and then sent me happily on my way 20 minutes later. He didn't charge me a penny. This review is a thank you for saving me today. I literally can't log into work without my phone and that was just very nice.<//Text><Name>Robert Johnson<//Name>< userid>

Tim is the quintessence of transparency, honesty, and customer empathy! Tim went out of his way to figure out the best, most cost-efficient solution for my repair, which was not easy for him because my phone isn't a common model! He genuinely cared about me as a customer, and he informed me about the cost breakdown at every step of the way. Moreover, Tim finished the repair even sooner than his estimated pick-up day, AND he charged 50 percent less than the last place I went for a repair (a place which I won't name, but it doesn't matter because everyone should just go to Tim!). SD Cell Phone Repair is the absolute best, and I would recommend Tim's business to ANYONE and EVERYONE.< /review>

Phone screen cracked. Stopped by without an appointment  and Tim had It fixed with a new screen in 20mins. It works perfectly and I had hardly any downtime in my busy day. Plus he’s also a fun guy to chat with. Highly recommend him and SD cell phone Repair.<//review>

I am also apart of Steve's fan club. He was such a great help in replacing the screen on my iPhone. It was like magic watching him replace it right before my very eyes and the price is RIGHT. Steve was super cool and very friendly. I am so glad I decided to give him a try. I highly recommend him :-)< /review>

<Text>Amazing. I took my phone in because another company didn't glue my screen on right until it started coming off. I came here and the prices are amazing. Customer service is great. Time flew for me as I saw him repair my phone, quality work done fast. He's a very honest and straight forward guy, friendly with a great talking personality. You just know he will do an amazing job. He left my phone looking brand new with a great screen. Hopefully I'll never break my screen again, but if I was to, I'd definitely come back here and i definitely recommend this place.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80d954e63a194791:0xe548b0991b9323fe</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

terrible customer service, repair wait times are basically next day or day after, even if they tell you that it will be a couple hours, had to go back in to get my phone fixed after i paid to fix it, then was charged again to go back in because they didnt fix it the first time and couldnt be any more less satisfied. there are other places way better than here and i will go there for now on.< /review>

Tim does fantastic (and fast) work! I was in for a phone screen repair and was out the door fixed again in under an hour. From seeing his interaction with customers you can tell he genuinely wants to help people out and will work hard to solve your problem whatever it may be. Would recommend highly and would go back again if I needed more work done.<//text>

THESE GUYS DESERVE 10 STARS ! COME HERE WITH YOUR BROKEN DEVICE BEFORE TAKING TO YOUR CELL PHONE PROVIDER IF YOU WANT TO SAVE TIME, MONEY AND AGGRAVATION ! After jumping through hoops with my cellphone company and the insurance company that I've been paying premiums to for 9 years (still no replacement device  after a week) I googled "San Diego cell phone repair" hoping  to retrieve contacts from my dead device that wouldn't charge. I called and Tim(?) said to bring it over. When I arrived HE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO WORK ON MY PHONE - IN @ 30 MINUTES I WALKED OUT OF THIS SHOP WITH MY PHONE POWERING UP AND CHARGING !!! $35 !!!  UN-BELIEVABLY FANTASTIC SERVICE !!!!!  .... BEST DECISION I EVER  MADE WAS TAKING MY DEVICE HERE ! .... THANK YOU !</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>5 well earned stars. Came in with a cracked iPhone 7. Tim repaired it on the spot for a great price ($99) out the door. Right as it was done I noticed the color of the screen was a litttttttle different. Super small picky detail which I could have lived with. He was so cool about it though that he insisted I come back the next day when he got a new shipment of screens to try another.

Personally called me the next day to let me know they got them and swapped it out. Next one was perfect.

Super friendly straight forward shop. Best customer service I’ve dealt with in a long time. Thanks guys 🤘🏼<//Review><name>Andrew Crum</name><gmap_id>0x80d954e63a194791:0xe548b0991b9323fe< /gmap_id>< time>

I rarely write reviews and even rarer than that, I rarely write a GOOD review.  I am a business owner myself and I understand the importance of taking care of customers and going the extra mile.  Tim at SD Cell Phone Repair does exactly this.  Just all around good business tactics and I wish more businesses handled things the way he does.  Quality parts at excellent prices installed on my phone to get it working like new.  Thanks again Tim!<//Text>

This guy is the absolute best. I'm a college student on a budget and Tim managed to help me get all the contacts and needed info off my obliterated S4 and onto a new one for cheap. I needed the job done ASAP and he was happy to help. He even stayed open a little late to finish up so I didn't have to come by the next day. All around good guy.

Replaced cracked screen on iPhone 6 Plus. Tim is a cool personable and funny guy who provides fast exceptional service at very fair prices.  If you don't have warranty or insurance this is hands-down your best option in San Diego!!  So glad I made this decision instead of going to the monopolistic corporate greed path.<//review>

<text>Guy talks allot but is funny, does good work and charges a fair price. He thought the fix was going to be 50 until I got in and he said the replacement part was not a thing he could get so he tried to bend back into place. Thought it was still gonna be 50 but he charged 10 for the work. My phone works great now.< /text><resp>{'time': 1485805031312, 'text': 'Thanks for coming in and your review it is much appreciated'}< /resp><UserId.>103717064403348178964< /UserId.>< pics>

<Review>Made sure everything was functional and fair price on non-common phone (not iPhone).  Had initial issue with microphone, but made this a priority and fixed the issue immediately.  I could tell he knew what he was doing and I will for sure be back (when I break my next phone), but also recommend for anyone in the SD area.  Thank you my friend.< /Review>< pics>

Friendly and fast service with very reasonable prices. Replaced a shattered screen on my OnePlus 5, not a common phone, so it's a good credit to his skill with Android phone repairs. He was very nice about follow up to touch up the adhesive for fingerprint sensor. I confidently recommend him to anyone who needs phone repairs.< /Text>

<review>So my phone screen broke a day before having to leave to NYC. I needed my screen repaired asap. Luckily the guys at SD Cell Phone Repair saved the day. They didn't have the parts to repair it, so they had to go out and pick them up. All and all, they were able to get the phone repaired in a few hours... just amazing! Their customer service is fantastic. Super nice guys.

I highly recommend using their services!</review>< pictures>

Went in to get my sister-in-laws phone fixed. Easily the best experience I've ever had a phone repair store. We were second in line and we only had to wait 30 min for the fix. 15 min for the person in from of us and then 15 for us. Easy, fast and enjoyable, best part, affordable. I'd recommend this to any and all people who have iPhones and need to get their screen fixed.< /Text>

<text>I put my sim card in my phone without the tray like a dumb-dumb and the homie at the store was able to remove it with surgical precision.

<Review>Super friendly guys at SD Cell Phone Repair. They fixed my daughters older Sony  android phone. (charger port was damaged). Due to a completely drained battery they couldn't get it powered in the shop, but suggested I let it charge overnight. I did and it now works flawlessly and can be charged. I'll come back next time I have a broken phone. Thanks guys.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80d954e63a194791:0xe548b0991b9323fe<//gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

Tim was great! I highly recommend SD Cell Phone Repair! He was friendly, informative and fixed my phone while I waited (not long at all). Plus he was less than the other places quoted.</Text>

From the time you walk in the door you get the feeling that Tim is a great guy and that he is going to take care of you. I had an iPhone 6 screen that needed to be fixed and less than an hour later I was up and running. But during that hour I chatted with Tim and he shared great business advice as I watched literally 10 different customers walk through his door. Bottomline- Tim will fix your phone at a competitive rate within a short time frame and give you a great experience.< /Text>

Quick and friendly services provided, iPhone repair completed on the spot within 20 minutes.  The screen was replaced for 69 dollars and a screen protector was added free of charge.  This place deserves repeat business from us.< /review>

Had to get a charging port replaced on our s3. David was able to get it done in about less than 30 minutes job well done I can't believe the service here. The prices and knowledge on repairing a cell phone are reasonable and they are excellent experts in knowing what to repair and not repair. David's knowledge with various cell phones was refreshing and I highly recommend if you need your phone fixed stop here and David and the rest of the guys will do a great job</Text>

<Text>I never write reviews. This is one exception. My wife dropped her Nexus 5 and the screen shattered. We get off work at 5pm and did a quick google search and saw 5 star review for the guys at SD Cell Phone Repair. We give Tim a call. He says he not only has the part in stock, but that if we make it by 6:15pm he will have it done same day. We drove from Sorrento Valley and made it just one time. The building was a little confusing, but we found the shop with little trouble. We were in and out in about 20 minutes. I was floored. Not only is the phone fully restored, it was done quickly. To top it all off, the guys there are awesome people. They chatted with us the entire time and are very personable! Would give more than 5 stars if I could. You guys just earned our loyalty!< /Text>< pics>

<review>Tim replaced my Nexus 6P battery in about 20 minutes.  Was very hesitant to have work done on my phone since the battery was the only issue and Nexus phones are notoriously difficult to work on.  Phone feels like it is brand new again. It's now clear to me why Tim has so many positive reviews...great customer service combined with competence.  A win win.< /review>< Time>

<Text>Yet another great experience at SD Cell Phone Repair! I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 that found its way into a basin of Epsom Salts water that had been used for soaking my feet. I thought I got it out in time, but the next day it refused to accept a charge. No matter what I tried, it kept saying that I was using a bad charger, and that it was turning off the charge to protect the phone.

I took it to Tim's place, and I was amazed again at how he is unfailingly helpful and considerate to every person he interacts with. He did not charge me for getting my phone working again.

Thank you again, Tim. This is the second time you have saved my phone at no cost. I truly appreciate your approach to life and other people. I wish I could give you more stars, 5 is not enough.</Text>< pics>

<Text>SD Cell Phone Repair saved my butt last year! I dropped my LG G3 phone 2 days before my trip to Europe and the screen cracked and made it unusable. They repaired it within 1 hour! No need for me to drive back and forth like with other repair service shops and they even have a better price for the repair. I am so happy with their service and highly recommend them to anyone who need their phones fixed in a hurry.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

These guys fixed my phone after I'd been shut down by other  places that are exclusive to specific models of phones and nonchalant about their business/caring about makin money or not  lol ~ Tim & Chris are awesome!! High quality service paired with appreciation and honest work ethic. While I certainly hope I don't need another repair soon I can only sing the praises of this place and highly recommend for ease and convenience.<//Text>

< Review>
I live in Santa Fe and got the runaround from the tech company in my town saying it would take two days.  I was flying to San Diego the next day and researched on the net, made an appointment to get a new glass and protector when i got my rental car and zoomed over there.  Tim and David kick butt and I was outta there in less than two hours and all was well.<//Review>

Tim is the best! I tried to fix my Nexus 5 power button issue myself, but in the process ended up making the screen go blank. I took it to Tim who tried everything possible, but the phone was beyond repair. Only If I would have gone to Tim in the first place. Tim is an honest and skilled professional. I won't go anywhere else in the future. I would highly recommend Tim.< /review>

<Text>The service was great! I called in beforehand because I was worried he wouldn't be able to fix my phone, since it's not that common(zte zmax pro), and he told me to take it in so he could take a look at it. I took it in not knowing what to expect, but he calmed all my fears and made me feel welcome with his friendly banter as he made quick work of fixing my phone(I dropped it and the volume up button was stuck pressed down as a result). Then, after having to take it completely apart to fix it, he refused to accept any payment, but just wished me well. Loved the service and would definitely come back if my phone ever broke again!</Text><GmapID>0x80d954e63a194791:0xe548b0991b9323fe< /GmapID><rating>5<//rating>< date>

I thought I needed a new charging port, but he showed me that it was just lint (2 years of lint, squished into the port over and over) and he quickly took it out with his custom tweezers. Charging works. They have remarkable integrity and character for not selling me a port I thought I needed but didn't. Thank you San Diego Cell Phone Repair!<//review>

<Text>SD Cell Phone Repair has successfully fixed a number of my family's iPhones over the last several years - batteries, broken screens, bad buttons, and even water damage.  But, what pushed me to write this positive review was Tim, the owner's, phenomenal service.  After Tim was unable to replace my iPhone 5 screen because he ran out of that model screen due to a holiday rush, he hand delivered and installed it the following day.at my house.  You can't beat that kind of customer service.  I'll be going back.<//Text>< pics>

My Samsung Stratosphere would no longer take a charge so I began the process of trying to find a repair facility to help me out.  After numerous "no we don't do that,"  one shop suggested I contact SD Cellphone Repair.  Just about the best repair advice this year!   Tim had to order the parts and kept me advised as to when they were expected to be delivered.  I dropped my phone off after work and he fixed it in half an hour.  Awesome service.  If you need your phone fixed,  this is the shop.< /Review>

<Review>This place is so awesome.  I took my friend here, who shattered the BACK of her iPhone 4. Everyone I called did NOT have this replacement part, or had no idea what I was talking about.  I called Tim the day before coming, and he said "no prob! $20 and 5 minutes, it'll be good as new." YAY!

The place was a little confusing to find - it is inside a building with a bunch of other business (tattoos, massages, accupuncture - a one stop shop!).  There was a nice man sitting on the couch at the entrance who seemed to know the layout well.  He directed us immediately to Suite 2.  The whole shop is basically a closet with a work desk and some parts up on the wall.  We walked in and he was about to assist one guest ahead of us, but had remembered me from calling the day before!  My friend handed her phone over, and Tim chatted with us while he did his magic.  It literally took one minute for him to finish the job.  We gave him the $20 and were on our way!

I recommend this place to everyone with phone troubles!  It seems like he also has some accessories for sale! THANKS TIM!</Review></record>

<Review>Tim is simply on point with phone repairs, especially all iPhone and Samsung.  Also quick and straight forward with the pricing, might be $5-$10 more than the other place, but then again you got to ask yourself, how much does your sanity and aggravation is worth?  $5?!?!<//Review><time>1450468392590<//time><username>Le Duong< /username>< gmapID>

<review>Dropped my LG G2, phone was useless.  I called him up, he said he needed a day to get the new screen and digitizer, came by the next day and he fixed it while I waited.

About 4 months ago my Galaxy S3's power port stopped working, and after calling around to a few places that said they can't fix it since the power port is attached to the main board, I found this place where I was told they could fix it.

I got to watch as my phone was disassembled, and talked to Tim as he worked on my phone about random stuff ranging from what he was doing to why I got in to computer science.  It was really great getting to watch him work as he explained to me what he was doing and showed me where the problem on the old part was.  He fixed my problem on the spot in about an hour and I walked out the door with a perfectly working phone.

Last week my phone had a different problem and I came back to Tim since he did such a great job with my first problem.  After taking my phone apart and chatting for about an hour or so, he was able to partially but not completely fix my problem.  Since he wasn't able to fully solve my problem he didn't charge me, though I insisted on paying for his time and the partial fix he was able to provide.

If anyone is in San Diego and their phone breaks, I would definitely send them over to SD Cell Phone Repair.  He definitely knows his stuff and it's nice to be able to chat with him while he's working.< /Review>

< review>
Just came back from this place after being referred from another cell phone repair shop that is much, much closer to where I live. It was totally worth the trip; I cannot say enough good things about Tim, his friendliness, and his professionalism. He was able to quickly diagnose the problem that I had with the cell phone that I brought in (I couldn't get my new digitizer screen to work). After identifying the LCD connection as the problem (not the digitizer), he put in one of his own LCDs that happened to be laying around, and left it in, free of charge. He promptly fixed my phone back to "like-new" condition, all while teaching a nice old lady how to use a smartphone from scratch. Also while I was in his shop, Tim took a call from another guy who was trying to do-it-yourself repair his own phone, and answered many of his questions about the process. After doing some quick research on parts, he advised the guy that replacing his phone would overall be more cost-effective to him than repairing it due to the parts being expensive for that particular model. Tim's prices are extremely competitive, and I couldn't be happier with the service. A+ business, and A+ human being.< /review>

Tim over at San Diego Cell Phone Repair was a great host. He fixed my cell phone Samsung Galaxy in about 1 hour. It had a broken LCD and even though I could still see the screen, it wasn't working right anymore. After the screen was repaired, everything worked as normal. Thanks Tim.< /text>

< Review>
I was referred to this gentleman who I found to be very knowledgeable and knows a lot about cell phone troubleshooting.  My samsung galaxy s3 was having problems when I tried to charge it and I had to jiggle the USB cord to get it right and start charging. TIM took  a quick peek under the microscope and quickly diagnosed the problem to be a couple of loose connection pins. I said that if he had to replace the whole USB power port to go ahead and do it and he was honest enough to tell me that a simple soldering job with fix it. In and out in 5 minutes. I am glad there are still people in this world who are honest and hard working. I had gone to the cricket store where I bought the phone and all they wanted me to do was to upgrade to the s4. Save your hard earned money and go to Tim so he can salvage your good ol reliable phone.  Thanks again Tim.</Review>

<review>Went to this place earlier this year. We started a conversation about what I do for work and where I live. Once I told her I work from home and I love it, her attitude changed. She started throwing my hands around and looking out the window being super careless. Will never go back. Jealousy is silly?< /review><rate>1< /rate></record>

I had a great experience with Vivian she was my main nail lady since 3 years ago. All staff are very sweet and welcoming. Vivian is far by the best nail tech she’s the one to ever really work on my hands, She did exactly what I asked for✊🏽<//Text>

I had my doubts when I first walked into this place but I was proven wrong! This was absolutely amazing. It felt just a tad bit rushed but the meticulous attention to detail more than outshined that small detail. This is the best set of acrylics I’ve ever gotten.<//Text>

Updating my review. Very unprofessional and unhygienic.  Seems they treat groups well but dont go in alone. Technician wiped the cuticles she removed on the skin of my foot as she cleaned my nails. Overall gross and rude. I left after she cleaned them because i was grossed out and the other technician helped two other ladies after my arrival and didnt honor my place in line for service. Loved this place when i came in with my sister but definitely disappointed today with the treatment and service. Definitely not hygienic and overall only care about her frequent clients. Goodluck and if you go. go with a group of people.< /Text>

I used to love this place and then last time I got acrylic nails here they didn’t do a good job and they lifted around the edges after 3 days of getting them. Due to the lifting I got acrylic nail fungus growing on my natural nail under the fake nail. Be careful and make sure they do a good job so your nails don’t lift up and let moisture under there which is a breeding ground for fungus.<//review>

Whenever, from now on, I want to TREAT myself this is Exactly where I'll go♥️🎯♥️ As soon as I entered
I was greeted by every technician in the shop! I was immediately seated and the sweet gal brought me a bottle of water🎯A FIRST🎯and Greatly Appreciated.
She began prepping my nails and was so gentle❣️
Soon another little gal took over.  Her name was 🌹Vivian🌹 What a Delightful Experience🌸 I was done in record time (40 minutes) and my nails look Superb🌺 Vivian even spoke to me while she was working!!!
A first🌷This was the 6th nail shop I have visited in Napa and THE 🎯BEST BY A LONG SHOT🎯 Thank you and Kudos, Vivian💐 I SHALL HAPPILY RETURN
AND LQQK FORWARD TO BEING IN YOUR SWEET SHOP, Thank you for making my day and my nails Are Perfect💕♥️💕<//Review>

Monday, 24 May 2021 @ 2:25 Pm. Came in to check an amazon package that states “unfortunately, package was not delivered and holding at carrier location for pick up” . Lady at the service counter told me my package was not delivered, and I told her that’s why I’m here. She checked website and told me it states not delivered again with an attitude that seems like I’m bothering her. Then she tried to explain to me what the status on Amazon means which I did told her I perfectly understood what it means when it states “holding for pick up” and that is the reason I’m checking if they have it. Instead of telling me that UPS will try to attempt delivery again, she then again told me the item was not delivered. Total lack of customer service and does not have the right attitude to work in customer service environment. I love this location but with an employee like her, you will lose customers. If she’s not happy with that position, time to get another job.

Tuesday, 25 May 2021 @2:30 pm. Went back to pick-up my package. Stood in line and was called by the same employee that provided service the previous day. She asked me what I need help on so I stated I’m there to pick up a package, she asked for my ID which I provided, after she read my name she asked me if I wanted her to provide the service. When a customer approached you and given you what you asked for so they can get what they need, that means the service is welcome, don’t create another issue or scene. Just do your job and both customer and employee are satisfied. At the end, the other male employee stepped in to complete the issue of my package and asked me to get service on another location in the future and when I asked the lady for her name, she refused and covered it with her hand. For the owner, it’s all in your CCTV for review.< /Text>

<username>Vanessa T< /username><review>Had an Amazon package that needed to be returned. Arrived and gentlemen told me that the label needed to be printed and not able to scan code from my phone. He explained that I would need to email the label directly to the store. Upon asking what email address, he points behind me and tells me to look at one of the 10 signs on the other side. Asked which sign, his response is the sign by the computer(there were 3 monitors, 1 was being used by the other clerk and other 2 empty). Then asked which computer, his response is to point at the business cards that were right in front of him. I pick up the business card and forward the email with return instructions. Didn't complain when he took care of another customer and waited another 15 minutes for him to finish. When he was done, I placed the box on the scale and asked if he received the email I sent. I don't recall hearing a response, just typing on the keyboard and scanning the original barcode of the unopened box several times. Now I didn't want to question him because I am unfamiliar with their process. He then hands me a shipping receipt. Left the store with doubts and decided to look up the tracking number that he printed. Turns out, the package is being delivered back to my house instead of back to Amazon. Obviously he never checked for the email I sent with the return label. Went back inside the store and I kid you not, maybe 5 minutes passed and they are not able to find my package. Another clerk helped and told me that the Amazon return label is not acceptable. Someone please help me understand this. Also she said the return label which listing the new tracking number with a barcode was not supposed to be taped on the outside but left on the inside. So then how is UPS supposed to know where to send the package? Anyway contacted Amazon and fortunately they were very understanding after I explained the package was being sent back to my house in error. Their customer service was outstanding, this UPS store, not so much.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The only reason why I am giving this place a five stars is because it’s very organized and neat. I was greeted by Ms. Gaia who’s very friendly and attentive. She was quick to process my packages and some mails, and her vibes just light my spirit the rest of the day. She made sure I got everything I needed. Really helpful and professional
I highly recommend doing business here.< /Review>

My first experience at this UPS store was amazing. Everyone is professional here yet lighthearted and down to earth. Gaia did a great job with helping me to get my order from my online store shipped to my customer with advice on shipping time and insurance. The atmosphere here is positive will be sure to do business here.< /review>

I stopped in at this store and received the best customer service. I was struggling carrying a few boxes and one of the workers named Rachel was so quick to help me and was super nice while I took a few mins to find my return information for everything. Super glad I chose this location, very helpful.<//text>

<Review>Gaia, did an amazing job assisting me with sending my important documents today. She displayed great professional demeanor and was very knowledgeable about the different mailing services that UPS provides, and she helped me make an informed decision. I greatly appreciate her great customer service!

<text>During this pandemic the ups store has been my go to for all my printing and packaging needs. I have to say I can tell the difference when Rachell is attending the store everyone goes to her for help. I've been able to count on her for all my printing and packaging needs.

<review>I think this was my first time sending something through UPS. I chose the UPS near me with the best reviews. I was a little apprehensive walking in but the excellent customer service that I was met with by Raquel made it clear why it was the best reviewed UPS in my area. Thank you once again Raquel for making my fist experience shipping through UPS such a great one. 10/10 for being so helpful.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Absolutely excellent service and were quick and efficient. Rachell, an excellent manager who showed really good leadership qualities; very calm, polite, and knew everything that was going on around her even while multi tasking running everything like a captain of a ship lol. Her coworker Tavo also showed terrific teamwork. Overall really pleased on the service.<//text>

I had a bad experience with my international shipment .. they did not do me well the documentation that I needed to bring .. the person who attended me is training and had no idea how to do the work .. and I did not like it.  that I still pay.  A lot, they made a customs charge to the person who received it and they did not give me that information ... how is it possible that you send a gift and pay and the person who receives pay is not fair ... I do not recommend sending packages internacional</Review>

The BEST customer service I’ve ever had. I was struggling on how to return my amazon package after having such a stressful day and Rachell helped and explained how to do so and was very patient with me! Thank you.</Review>

Just go ahead and mark this your  favorite place to go on Google maps. This is the best ups store and the employees always go the extra mile to help you out, which explains why it's so busy. And it's conveniently located near a small shopping mall and bus stops.< /text>

<review>I needed to pick up a package & get it to the bank by 5pm . I arranged to have it delivered to National city hub. My tracking said it would arrive by 3:00 . I arrived but my package was not there . Moe and Sam went the extra mile to help me find where my package was and help me make arrangements to pick it up . I was anxious and they helped to keep me remain calm . Because of these two amazing employees I was able to get my package to the bank before closing . I am grateful for their kindness to me. Today they are superheroes in my eyes .< /review>< pics>

< Review>
I have lived here for four years (2017 to 2020) and I have loved this community in every way. I have nothing to complain or point out about Crossroads, but only have praises. I recently moved out only because I wanted a place with walking distance to grocery stores, but would have continued here otherwise. Management and maintenance both are excellent and they have always gone over and beyond our expectations. I still love the way I used to get super quick email responses for my queries, be it anything - which is something I already miss at my new place lol!

My apartment here was my home and will always have a very special place in my memories. Thanks to team Crossroads. Cheers!</Review>

<Date>1627155477840</Date><Rating>2< /Rating><Text>Crossroads is a good society with great features. I like it overall and thus have been living here for three years. However, society is going downmarket, and I have seen the overall experience erode. The community is certainly above average, but I am giving two stars to give readers an idea of things where it falls short. Before you move in, please note the following things about this place
1. Security is only for show: don't get fooled by the security patrol, the camera, and the main gate locks. Overall the security here is for namesake. The only place there is a lock is the main gate i.e, where from you enter when you come here to visit the property. There are many functional access to each building that is always unlocked. so anyone can come and knock on your door. Every other day you will find a solicitor knocking on your door.  Please note that main gate lock will keep your instacart and doordash deliveries at bay, and you will have to come down to let them in.
2. Faulty fire alarms: expect the fire alarms to go off every other week. Expect the building fire alarms in the middle of the night or during your work meetings.
3. No guest parking: because there isn't any security enforcement, the parking here is a joke. Don't ever expect your visitors to find parking. Residents routinely use the guest parking. If you live here, you will know that residents use all the guest parking. There will be cars parked in guest spots straight for 3-4 months.
4.Garden and common area upkeep: since pandemic, the maintenance and cleaning are sub quality. the grass cutting is always behind schedule, and dog poop is a common sight< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1627413566283, 'text': 'Dear Prasoon,\n\nFirst and foremost, thank you for being our valued resident for the past three years.\n\nRegarding the security concerns you expressed, we would like to invite you to please come by our leasing office so we may address these issues and concerns.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience that the fire alarm testing may have caused you.

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Haven't lived here for more than 2 months, already had a neighbor tell me their motorcycle was stolen, mine was towed out of resident overflow this morning, still can't get ahold of the leasing office to ask why... They're too busy to help or to return my calls. Seems ridiculous to tow a rent paying resident. When there are multiple abandoned vehicles that haven't moved out of the guest spots since I moved in. Had my bike parked for less than 12 hrs before it  was towed.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Not sure how to change this account name so it’s not under my dad’s name. But, this place is unsafe. My front door doesn’t lock all the way sometimes and one of my cars was broken into. I moved in just a few weeks ago and have already had countless maintenance issues. My garage disposal still isn’t working properly. Please, PLEASE consider putting cameras right at the entrances to the gate or even gating the entire garages with an access code. We can’t keep having multiple break-ins.</Text>< Pics>

Honestly, this is the best leasing experience ever. I wanted to share my story with you all. But before that, I wanted to say - Sheila (Leasing Specialist), you are the BEST!

I had plans to get married in late November 2020 and was looking for a comfortable and safe apartment, close to work for both of me and my wife. I heard about La Jolla Crossroads through a resident and a close friend of mine and visited the leasing office in the month of October, 2020. Shiela took care of me and answered all my questions very politely and very professionally. I was in love at first sight after checking the apartment, it’s landscaping and amenities that La Jolla Crossroads are offering. I had to wait before I move in till I get married in india and return back to USA to start a new life. Sheila was in touch with me during this period, discussing the leasing opportunities and available leasing benefits. I returned back to USA in the month of December and visited back the leasing office in the month of Jan, 2021. Sheila received me and showed me the available apartments and I must say, her hospitality and professionalism has not changed. I finally decided to signed up for the lease and I am happily looking forward to move in and start a beautiful new life with my wife.

Guys, if you are looking for a great high rise, resort style affordable apartments, this is the place. Go Check It Out, Man!< /Text>

< review>
I was not asked to write this review.

My wife and I moved in 3 weeks ago and so far everything has been great. The apartments are very spacious, well-priced and I have not had one occurrence of noisy neighbors (which is uncommon is large complexes). In fact, I barely see anyone around the place which means most people are staying inside and keeping safe during COVID.

I had to submit a maintenance request on day 2 which was handled efficiently. The booking system for the fitness area and pools are easy to use.

Location is great. Nobel Park is a block away. Anything else you could possibly need is 10-15 mins drive away.

Parking seems safe and secure. Elevators work. The complex is always clean and tidy.

People in other reviews complaining about rent staying the same while amenities are closed are acting crazy. It's a pandemic and La Jolla Crossroads is doing what they can to protect residents. At the same time, they are also a business.< /review>

They never fix their leakage from the garage. I escalated the issue for half years and never got the update from the office unless you asked for it. They even increase the rent for no reason and not solving the issue. The office said will get back with the update and you never get it.< /text>

Staff is real nice and helpful off of my experience...... but as for the place it’s self walls are super thin so you can hear everything and it’s just a busy area with a lot of people I personally can say it’s not the worst place I have stayed but there is enough issues for me not to renew my lease if you’re a college student I can see this place being a place for you if you like peace and quiet or have a family I’d stay clear of it.<//review>

<Text>Due to COVID-19, I moved out (in addition to three roommates attending a local university with me) and I only just received my deposit check after the first one got lost. Unfortunately, every roommate is required to present ID and be present when we live about one hundred miles away from each other. I was told to contact Customer Service, but I've emailed them twice (the first time at least a week ago) and haven't gotten a response. The staff has always been unhelpful, but this takes it to another level. If you want staff who will actually help and support you with issues related to Crossroads, consider moving somewhere else.

Edit: I moved out at the end of March.<//Text>< userid>

<text>My car license plate was stolen in the garage for which I did the police report, got new plates & requested management to check on this & do something about it.  They said they looked into it & I was told that security found nothing.   I asked them to reimburse for cost of plates & they said no.  The time lost from work in doing all of this was worth nothing to the management.  What is their landlord insurance policy for?  I wonder.
Today my new car was vandalized as someone wrote profanity all over my driver & passenger windows.   I hope the management will do something about this.  We will see.  If you live in this complex please be aware & be safe.  Thanks for reading this review.<//text>< rate>

<review>La Jolla Crossroads is the absolute worst. Do yourself a favor and stay away it's not worth it. The carpet was stained at the time of move in and continued to refuse to clean it when I repeatedly put in a request during entire my stay. Had to stay in hotels for 4 days due to flood in my apartment during covid and I had to move out of the place due to visible mold. They agreed to let me leave without penalty due to the mold BUT after finding out that they sent the deposit to the wrong address just to delay giving back my deposit, I realized that they charged me more than $900 for changing the carpet which was damaged due to the flood that was reported as being caused by poor plumbing. When I shockingly asked them, they responded so rudely that there were stains on carpet and DISREGARDED all the maintenance requests I made at the time of move in!!! They don’t respond to my complaints now and their excuse is covid!! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place who charge you unfairly.

Me and my wife just moved to LJX. On the second day my car got broke into. Very frustrating situation. It was underground L3 level in gated parking lot.
Took my two jackets and my wife's shoes.
Another neighbors car got broke into at same time as well.

We have filed report and notified management about the incident and they refused to compensate or change the parking spot. We even asked them to install security cameras but they not going to do that.
According to property manager, security camera doesn't help reduce crime. They have tried it in the past but I don't believe that.

We found out anyone can get in to gated parking lot through doors in the first floor without key because it's broken. Looks like it was never working for long time.
We have told the management about this issue and they didn't know about it until now. Yeah sure.

I really feel insecure to park my car and I am not the only one feel that way. I have asked couple tenants about this issue and they all want security camera installed. Even security guards at LJX agreed.

Do not move here until they take this serious and install security cameras.<//text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>So I lived here for 3 years and before my last term I was kinda like the environment until the leasing manager showed me how indifferent she is to residents' life.

I lost two motorcycles here in the garage and the police failed to receive a surveillance from the leasing manager. FAILED. I don't blame the police because the office was very helpful and he tried everything that he can do. He still cannot get anything from the leasing. When I talked to the manager, she's always just tell me to ask the police and when I told her that I just called the police yesterday. She couldn't answer anything and simply just went inside her office, leaving me behind and don't care at all.

It's terrible. Just a general Warning to potential residents:

STAY AWAY FROM HERE. If anything happen to you, they won't care at all.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

One of the worst places you will ever visit in your life time. Beware at all costs.

They reopened as 365 luxury apartments, but they're the same office and worthless people working.</review>

<Review>La Jolla Crossroads is the absolute worst. Do yourself a favor and stay away it's not worth it. They're a wolf in sheep's clothing. The amenities and the units themselves are nice but they don't make up for the headache that is La Jolla Crossroads. The staff is unhelpful and rude. They act so pompous everytime you want to ask a question or even pick up a package. When they need something from you they will harass you nonstop but when you need something from them it's like trying to pull teeth.

I've had my car broken into twice while living here. The entrance to the garage says they have cameras but in reality they don't. I asked the front office about this and they said they 'planned' to install cameras but never did. Sounds like false advertising to me, when I rented this place I thought they had good security in the garages. The elevators are constantly broke and so outdated, sometimes they will be down for days. The building fire alarm constantly goes off and you're forced to evacuate during odd hours of the night. Throughout the week there are very few days when there is actual peace and quiet so you can't have your windows open. Between the gardners, dump trucks, fighter jets, maintenance, and cleaning crew it is the noisiest apartment I've lived in.

Due to COVID all of the amenities have been closed for months. Part of our rent is for using and maintaing these amenities but do you think they partially refunded our rent since they were all closed? Hell no. That probably never even occured to them, this place is owned by investors and they only care about one thing, $$$$$. I'm not the only one, just look at the other reviews. This apartment appears to be one of the nicest in UTC/La Jolla but has the worst ratings, that should be a red flag to anyone.

They have an excuse for everything and if you complain you're basically fighting a losing battle because they're part of GardenCommunities a huge real estate conglomerate. They make the contracts so hard to understand and full of lawyer speak by design. In addition, they are consistently trying to push up rents to make even more profit. Don't support these people by paying more and more for rent. You have a choice to not rent here, don't make the mistake of being lured in by the appearance.</Review>< gmapID>

<gmap_id>0x80dc07335344d327:0xfe8625cb17ad32b5< /gmap_id><Text>Let me start by saying this, I love living at Crossroads. The location is phenomenal, it's expensive but the location, the beautifully landscaped exterior and roomy interior kind of make up for it. The residents are super friendly, quiet and considerate at least on my floor anyway. I'm a very low maintenance tenant, I pay rent on time, follow the rules and don't complain about anything. I do have to say this parking situation is unacceptable. I get home late between 6-7pm and by the time I get home, It takes an hour driving around to all buildings looking for a parking spot  when I know there are none. When you talk to the leasing office about it, they don't seem very concerned about doing anything to help or fixing the issue. Really, I would just like to provide that feedback, please do something about the parking situation and work on improving customer service and how you can make life easier for your residents. This is such a great place to live but that was a huge disappointment for me and I believe you can do better.<//Text></record>

The complex isn't too bad as a whole in our building.  The apartment could use some updates in appliances as they are a bit on the older side.

I'll echo what previous posters have said in the fact that the walls are thin.  We can hear every step our upstairs neighbors make.  We also hear every door being slammed in the hallway.  We live near the trash room and are constantly hearing that door slam.  This complex is largely catered to college kids and some families.

The amenities here are nice and you get access to the 360 ones as well, like their bowling alley and basketball court.  They have lots of events each month as well.

We put in multiple service requests for our toilet to be fixed because the seat kept sliding and it took four times before they finally just replaced the bolt as opposed to tightening the old one that was stripped.

The parking garage is also an issue.  There are mirrors at the top as you come around some corners, however, the corners are just that, as opposed to rounded so you have to take it a bit wider which is hard when there are other cars.  The parking spots are also like most in San Diego and skinny in nature.< /text>

Staff in leasing office are slow to communicate. They are not clear in emails and do not prioritize costumer service. The apartments overall  are nice but not necessarily worth the hassle of dealing with the leasing office.

I'd recommend living at Villas of Renaissance. Excellent costumer service and right across the street.< /Review>

NEVER make the mistake of living here! My roommate's car got broken into on a random night and the staff at the leasing office seemed least bothered about it. To top it off, my fiance's motorcycle got stolen in broad daylight and we faced the same issue with the leasing office. They seem to take zero responsibility. They claimed that the garages had cameras and that they would provide video surveillance to the cops but of course they didn't cause there's clearly NO cameras. We even spotted thieves one night at 3:45am when we were back from a party, reported that, and no action was taken. Well, why would thieves not want to enter? The parking garages throughout the community have been left wide open. They keep telling us that they are switching to cloud based gates, been hearing that for the past 6 months now. Fed up of all the happenings here, of course we are moving out! It's expensive for zero security and safety.</review>

Zero customer service, worthless security. They’ll cite you in a heartbeat for parking too long in a guest spot but they can’t seem to stop the constant stream of car break ins.

Also the mass shooting? Would prefer to just fire the security altogether and save a few bucks on rent — they’re clearly not doing anything useful.<//text>

My experience living at La Jolla crossroads for less than two weeks.

Day one of moving in the elevator broke down. The movers had to carry each item using the stairs.

Day one - three the AC was not functional. Took them 2 days to get the fixed.

Day three when the AC got fixed. The water started dripping from the ceiling wetting all my belongings and the carpet. I have no doubt that they will take the security deposit for the problem I have no control on.

They won’t let you add anyone to the lease once the lease is signed. Not even the day after you signed the lease.

The gates that lets you into the garage will sometimes be dis functional. Making you stranded inside garage with no means of personal transportation.

They will charge you $100 to replace a fob and amenities keys but $5 for mail room and house keys.  Not sure about the logic behind that.

My AC is nonfunctional again. Called in to put a maintenance request. It’s been more than a day with no help and I am spending my weekend in my apartment sweating.

Very regretful of deciding to move in even after reading all the bad reviews.< /text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Lots of pros and cons at LJX but overall I've been happy in the 11 months living here. We live in building 9155 which is a pet friendly building that I love except one annoying dog that never shuts up despite complaints. Overall the complex is quiet with the exception of screaming children at the pools or playgrounds on the weekends. The entire complex is extremely pet friendly and you will always see dogs being walked in the area, but the grounds are always clean. Most people do a good job of cleaning up after their pets and if not the landscaping team must. I always see cleaning crew sweeping the sidewalks and taking out trash so it looks well kept. The pools and gym are upscale and well kept. we get access to the 360 complex gym and basketball court which is gorgeous. You need a key to get through gates and a fob to get into Garages, so I've never seen an issue with break ins and I feel safe. These are the largest apartments you'll see in the UTC area which I feel justifies the high rent. Washer dryer In unit and huge living space and underground parking.

Guest spots are hard to snag and unfortunately there's no street parking nearby so friends have to walk from Renaissance Ave. The finishes are underwhelming and our floors are carpeted so that's a con.  we have a North facing balcony so the apartment is dark and patio never gets sun.

I will say the leasing office is slow to complete anything and hard to reach, but luckily I haven't had any major issues. Maintenance is awesome though! They come and fix things quickly.

Update: Rent did not get raised much at all. We moved to a different unit that faces east which gets much more natural light. Building 9135 is a bit louder since it overlooks the main courtyard. Overall still happy here!< /Text>< gmapID>

I have lived at La Jolla Crossroad for one year and half. Location is great, safe, and calm. It is close to the UTC Westfield,”shopping mall”. The maintenance garden community has a good response to fix any issues. The Price was getting higher as long as I extended my stay ¡¡¡. Generally it is a great place.< /review>

Let me first start by saying that I never lived here but I visited a friend for a few days and didn’t have a great experience. I would not recommend living here, especially if you have difficulty walking. It is very inconvenient with the parking garage, walking to an elevator, waking long hallways to your apartment, etc. The place is so confusing to guests too. The whole layout doesn’t make logical sense. And the people living there are strange. It is dog friendly but most residents are terrified of dogs which would freak out my dog. I also had some of my boxes stolen from the parking garage (I realize I probably shouldn’t have left stuff there but it was temporary -1 day- until I left). Someone rummaged through every single one of my boxes and took my expensive camera and laptop (which didn’t even work - I have old photos on there I was going to extract). Honestly it was probably the security crew since they just so happen to mention wanting the boxes removed so no one steals them...literally right after I noticed two boxes gone. Please don’t move here.< /Review>

I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  You'll notice the only good reviews are for a few of the maintenance guys and from people who have yet to actually move in.  You should only live here if you like being woken up in the middle of the night once a week by flashing lights and ear damaging alarms, enjoy rude neighbors, a management team who doesn't care at all about their residents, a company who would rather spend thousands of dollars upgrading the lobby every 6 months than doing any upgrades on the actual apartments and people consistently parked in your designated spot.  The walls are so paper-thin you can hear your neighbors breathing and something is constantly broke.  Children run down the halls screaming at the top of their lungs at all hours (we've even had kids jump in our balcony). No communication between security, maintenance and management, if you want anything done you have to ask 20 times and go through 10 different people and they'll come into your apartment without notice.   Anytime you need to call the font office, you get a voicemail and they don't call back for a week.  Not to mention how unsafe this place is, they don't use unique locks for each apartment and we've actually had a stranger open our door with their key in the middle of the night!  Someone in our complex held their family at gunpoint and we had the whole swat team show up, police cars are often lining the streets because of some issue. I've lived in almost 10 places the past 10 years and this is the worst I've ever experienced.   Save your sanity and go live elsewhere.<//Review>

- Because of old laundry machine, you may need to take your favorite clothes to a laundry outside. If the laundry machine or refrigerator has some problems, they always replace it with very old and used one. For instance, I complained that the laundry machine ruined my clothes many times. They said in my face that they would replace it with new one or they would send a technical expert to check it several times. But they just didn't show up at the appointed times. It has been more than 6 months and I gave up.
- You should pay around $100 for water and sewage of 1 bedroom apartment every month. You don't know the detail and just pay.
- It's not easy to use shuttle bus because of Irregular departure time and long route. It sometimes departs earlier to pick up people from other apartments.
- No auxiliary lock on the door which you can lock from inside. If you install with your money for your own safety, you need to restore its original state.
- Some dog pooh on the beautiful lawn.
- Water quality of swimming pool is very low. Sometimes, you will see some rash on your body.
- Noise level in some apartments is very high, because of the congested load and construction site.
- Maintenance office is not connected well with the management office.
- Regarding maintenance, security, and parking, you should call unkind and slow outsourced company
- For parking permit, you need to pay around $25 one-time fee.
- Few parking spot for guests. There are only a few, but mostly taken by tenants. You will never use it for your guest.
- Like car dealer shops, the employees has changed a lot. You may know why.< /text>

Less than two weeks here and didn’t even get a honeymoon phase lol.  Honestly, there might be tenants here that don’t care about the issues I’m about to list... but I always say it’s the small details that make a big difference. First and foremost, I feel more like a number figure than a person with a voice from the moment I received my keys. Lots of shoulder shrugs when voicing things to the office.  The second day of my move, elevators went down. Two other tenants informed me that’s “normal.” The unit I am in is next to an elevator so I had to sleep with a loud beeping noise until 11pm or so they got to it. Elevator was down around 2pm or so. PARKING IS HORRID!!! If you care about your car, don’t fall for what my leasing agent told me... “ we have lots of parking... we even have some people with high end cars living here like a Porsche”.... spaces are small, fluid leaks from the ceiling, and don’t get me started on the dips and speed bumps. If you complain, the answer is a shoulder shrug 🤷🏽‍♀️. And lastly the walls are PAPER THIN.. you can hear the mumbling of your neighbors when there talking in the room next door... and god forbid someone is doing their laundry late at night like my situation last night. If you’re planning on spending 2k+/month on rent.... there are PLENTY of better choices... && I’m jealous you were smart enough to yelp before rent!</review>

<review>I really like it here. I have been here about 4 years. The apartment sq. ft is the biggest in UTC. The maintenance staff is helpful and fix any issues quickly.  Amenities are good.
I live here mostly because the gym is big and awesome, very clean and well maintained, sometimes very busy though. and the gym staff is fun.
The leasing office is helpful most of the time, except they are always changing the staff for some reason. The really tall lady, I think her name is Amy, is very nice.

Cons:
Sometimes the elevator is broken.
Not enough guest parking.
People smoking on their balcony.
Too many people with dogs, and not cleaning up after them, I think it's supposed to be a no pet property.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We moved to the San Diego area about 2 months ago, and for 2 months have been looking for a place to settle. After seeing every property possible and still being undecided  we visited Crossroads La Jolla
The moment we entered the leasing office we were greated  by Tyler who was so warm, welcoming  and helpful  They certainly chose the right person for that job
Jennifer Muzio is our leasing consultant  she has worked with us to perfect every detail to make sure we found our ideal home. Equally as important to us she has done it with such class,  professionalism,
kindness, and warmth. I honestly believe that it was as  important to her that we have the home we love as it is to us.  Truly because of Jennifer we signed our lease today and are thrilled !! We highly recommend Crossroads LA Jolla< /Text>

Avoid this place at all cost, there is a lot of better options in the area, the leasing office are the worst they will lie just to make you sign a contract. as personal experience with them I sign my lease 3 weeks before my moving date which is more than enough to make the apartment ready. i received it while it was full with ants and roaches, a cloth room with cat feces smell also the fab key wasn't working a for 3 days, they toke 2 weeks to fixe the problem and some of them are still there. I’m just waiting for my lease to end and move out maybe to 360 or the villa.< /Text>

I lived at La Jolla Crossroads for three years now. The apartment itself is spacious and at a price that is about average or maybe a bit below average for the area. The management in the leasing office is hard to deal with as others have mentioned, although there are a few who actually seem to care and are helpful. I believe Lauren was the best.

Maintenance is awesome, you just have to put in a request online and give them permission to enter your unit and they get it done the next day. If you ask them to call you to make an appointment, you can wait a long time to never to get that call, so just give them permission.

The complex looks really great at first glance, but after you move in you quickly realize that this isn't really a great place. The appliances are low end, just like Costa Verde and La Regencia (same developers) and the outlets are still upside. The outlets make me wonder what else is going on behind the walls that was done with poor workmanship.

Security is a serious problem with this place. The door to our apartment doesn't have a peep hole or a chain, so you can't get any sort of preview of who is on the other side without opening the door. My wife's car was broken into ('97 Accord) and she had nothing valuable in view. They took her change container because there was nothing else in there worth taking. So no, having nothing valuable visible doesn't help.<//text>

<Review>1. The price gets increased very much when renew contract. And there are no carpet cleaning and change when renewal.
2. Price for each contract is very different, even the same floor plan and similar conditions. You have to negotiate and spend time to find out.
3. Sales person before renting talks something different from the the customer service person after moving. This means their information and benefits are not consistent. They try to attract you moving in with any words you like.
4.  Does not disclose information about discount unless you hear from somewhere else.
5. Lots of people having pets.
6. Typically one of the elevators is not functioning well.
7. Very limited guest parking, and very hard to find one available.
8. Most appliances are very bad quality. For example, kitchen appliances.
9. Customer service and maintenance are sometimes quick, sometimes very slow.
10. Sometimes UPS packages get lost if delivered in front of the door.<//Review><Name>Wei Chen</Name><rating>1</rating>< userid>

<Text>Poor Management, disrespectful and abusive costumer policy!
No responsibility for stolen items during maintenance!

We had a very serious incident in my apartment recently (water leaking through ceiling) and I came home to maintenance equipment all around my apartment. It took around 2 weeks to fix the issue and during this time they didn't provide us any accommodation considering that all my one-bedroom apartment was wrapped and we barely could move through all equipment that they set for maintenance. All they said was 'contact your insurance for your hotel fees'.
a few days after the issue was fixed I found my camera bag empty in the closet! all my lenses, my camera body, even cables and memories were gone!!!!! more importantly all my pictures that meant a world to me!
They even had to set equipment in my CLOSET! and more than 10 different people had the key to my apartment and I was out at work every day during maintenance!
after following up with the management (which took several weeks to answer) and filing to police department. they said SORRY we can not do any thing, you need to contact your insurance!!!!!
My insurance deductible is 3000 and my camera worth less than this (not considering the sentimental value that pictures had to me)
I am really sorry for this mean policy that they have; being so offensive, not being responsible about your privacy and belongings!
taking advantages of your trust!
and at the end not protecting their residents and no commitment!</Text><name>SAM S</name>< resp>

I n c o m p e t e n t    i n    t h e    h i g h e s t    d e g r e e.  Management of this complex is not to be trusted. They make it difficult to communicate with them. After moving out, you can not contact anyone by phone. They refer you to an email address that they do not respond to.

Within the first month of living here, we had maintenance people in our apartment for three weeks. Apparently there was a leak (we had no physical evidence of this in our apartment). Our washer and dryer were taken out and carpet ripped up by the maintenance people. For two weeks, they repaired the self made destruction and our washer and dryer were safe to use again. I used the washer and dryer in the morning. A maintenance man came in to "check on the leak." Little did I know that he disconnected the washer. I started a second load and water came flooding out. Do not trust the maintenance team.

The parking is terrible. The guest lot and overflow lots are always completely full. The garages are unsafe and the elevator in my apartment was not up to code.

It seems like a nice place to live at first but it's a facade.<//Review>

I would like to give ZERO stars, for how shady and incompetent the management is here.  They steal your security deposit.  Have been known to enter your apartment while youre away...  They send you a bill with the wrong address...so not even your unit number...and expect you to pay it.  They will never contact you via email even though that is their only form of communication.  I hope you can wait 2-3 weeks before anything gets done or even a reply back. REPORT THIS COMPANY TO THE BBB ASAP.  ALSO on yelp, scroll down to see the  "not currently recommended" link: and read those reviews too... All legit reviews.< /text>

< Review>
Here's my story.  A year ago, I tried to signed a lease extension for 14 months because I knew I would be moving out of state at that time.  They said no, you can't sign for more than 12 months.  I said, well, I might move then, because otherwise I'll have to pay the "month-to-month" rate for 2 months, which is an insane waste of money.  The rep assured me that I wouldn't have to pay the month-to-month, that they would "take care of me."  I asked if I could get anything in writing, he said no, but that "I could trust him."  Fast forward 1 year, I walk in, confident that they have my back.  Instead, I get "oh no, I never said that, you have to pay the full month-to-month."  So now I'm stuck throwing hundreds away or moving out for 2 months before moving again.  Learn from my lesson, these people will lie to get your business and do whatever they can to squeeze more money out of you.
On top of that, this place isn't that nice.  The amenities are nice, but the apartment construction is B-grade at best.  There's constant late-night noise from the moronic college kids who live here.  Not to mention the constant construction noise and construction materials clogging up the entire street.  Avoid this place, there are better options in the area.<//Review>

<Text>Living here for half of the year.
Some neighbor smokes weed every day, it stinks badly in my apartment. I complained multiple times but nothing has changed.
Terrible guest parking, always occupied. Guests usually have to search for a spot in other buildings and then walk.
Otherwise apartments are very comfortable, best layout I could find.
I don't have issues with noise like other people report here. But I live on top floor.</Text>< Rating>

RENTERS BEWARE, THESE PEOPLE WILL STEAL YOUR DEPOSIT ILLEGALLY ON WEAR AND TEAR ITEMS. Read carefully,
California does not hold the renter responsible for replacing things like carpet due to wear and tear. Think about it, you are a renter and you are paying to use that carpet. An owner is responsible for this, BY LAW. When you call them and try to dispute this, they say, "our carpets have a life expectancy of 5 years." Legally, that is the responsibility of the manufacturing company and they need to take that up with them. What does the warranty of the carpet have to do with you? This is their scam to collect your hard earned deposit money. I have lived their for 2 years and this is the type of treatment you get when you leave.

HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

Go to google, search for Small Claims Court Form SC100 -
this is an extremely simple form even a baby can fill out. File suite against them in small claims...The address is listed on the forms. Make sure you put an extra empty envelope with a stamp and your return address because small claims court requires a "send back" envelope. Also a check for 50 dollar made out to City Clerk.  If you need any help at all, don't hesitate to call the small claims advisory service which you can look up on google. THEY ARE FREE AND THEY WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. it is very easy to file a case in small claims and you shouldn't be intimidated at all. DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS! DONT BE LAZY ABOUT IT.< /text>

I have been living here almost 2 months but I already regret to choose this community. First of all, its really expensive based on what you're getting for the unit. Washer and dryer are old, they ruined my shirts. Secondly, pool and gym are extremely crowded. Walls are so thin, you can hear all conversation of ur neighbors. Security is a joke parking gates are always open especially for the weekend I don't know why. People are smoking a lot, leasing office is only sending email but there is no action. You can give less money and find much better place to live do't fool yourself because this community close to UTC Mall.<//Review>

<Time>1556991384829</Time><review>Ive been living in La Jolla Crossroads for 2 years because of the convenient place location to work.
It is a shame, because the apartment complex is nice but the property management is the worst I've ever lived in. There was a point that I was calling my friend who works at the irvine company to ask the questions that the property managers couldn't answer here. There is just one person who's very nice and its Karen, out of the 18 employees there.

The staff is HORRIBLE, try calling and they won't answer. Also, no one has been as disrespectful as Desire. I called at 10:23 AM on Monday because I got a letter in my doorstep saying that my payment failed and I had to pay my rent. I wanted to know what was going on and also I had some questions about the security of the property since my car has been vandalized 3 times.
I don't know if Desire didn't understood me or what, but she was super arrogant and hung up on me. So ofcourse, I was mad and decided to go talk to her in person since I thought it was very rude of her to do that, specially when the people in the office is there to answer your questions and help you out as much as they can. I told her in person how rude she was and how disrespectful she was by hanging up on a  when you know that the residents are paying for her to have her job.

Stay away from this complex, cars vandalized all the time and they claim they have security patrol but according to Desire, the security is for the pool and common areas. The manager Daniel, responds to emails a week after.

Horrible, horrible.<//review>< Gmap_id>

They might give some good offers to join and show modeled apartments instead of actual units but once the lease is signed all the worst things can happen. The leasing staff just works like automated machines with no intention of helping residents. For any requests they refer to contact customer care and even from them all we hear is sorry we cant help if they reply. Once the lease is done they increase the rent without any sense or negotiations, and so rudely they say like if you want sign or else you can leave. There is no proper security and cars and bikes are getting stolen and the management say they are not responsible as us to contact the maintaining security and the security will ask us to file police complaint.<//text>< pictures>

As a transfer student from OC, I’ve been here for about a year and now renewing lease for the upcoming year. So far everything seems awesome, the maintenance takes care of any issue immediately. Regarding neighborhood, I spent for about 2 weeks to find better quality with less fees but no success. Believe me guys! You won’t find any other complex with this monthly payment and quality. The only issue that this neighborhood has is its distance to UCSD. They do have shuttle service each day but normally I do prefer to take shared lyft costing around 6-7 dollars. Oh btw Sheila helped me to complete process for this year. Tnx Sheila ;)<//text>

This place gets a bad rap for it's customer service and I can understand why if you're expecting 5 star quality. The truth is, when you're as busy as this property,  they are more focused in making sure that all policies/procedures have been processed and that they get you in and out without a hitch.  As far as complaints from tenants, it really isn't part of their job description as a leasing agent to deal with the minutiae of small complaints. That's why they have maintenance and the patrol service. I like living here so far but of course I moved in knowing what to expect. Great property, beautiful landscaping, busy leasing office, but overall positive experience.<//text>

<Text>I love it here.

Yes the noises are loud but if you think about it where in Cali is there not loud noises. The Loft isn't in the south like I wanted it to but now that I've gotten used to the loft on the north u get a beautiful view. And There's more... There are three pools, two with Jacuzzis one is a wading(kiddy) pool that is safe for swimming lessons due to your 1-1 and 1/2 ft deep pool. Its like its own town. There's a supermarket, a deli, a barber, a salon, and so much more. There are also near by parks and grill areas near the pool. Anyone reading this and considering to live here, I hope a helped with the choice, this is a REALLY GOOD apartment.< /Text>< user_name>

Don't be fooled by the landscaping and nice appearance.  While it looks great on the outside and interior units, there are some serious issues with the management.  Everything is good until you have to deal with the leasing office - and you will.

They are nearly impossible to get a hold of, they choose which maintenance requests they want to address, accounting issues, unsecured perimeter doors.  You will also need to sign a 40 page lease, forfeiting nearly all of your tenant rights.

I am not one to complain, but feel others should be warned.<//text>

PROS: Apartments are spacious. The gym is good. Pools are OK, but frequently needing better water.
CONS: VERY BAD kitchen appliances (Dish washer and washer are Junk). Thin walls and ceilings. Everything vibrates with soft walking. Dogs everywhere despite being a NO PET community as they always claim.
Wifi on lobby, gym and pools are a must have and totally ignored by land lord.
The lease office are tendency of arrogance< /text>

The staff at the leasing office are extremely unhelpful. I was locked out of my apartment, so I asked someone to open my door for me, and they told me they couldn't because I wasn't on the lease? I've been living there for almost a year? Not only that, but when I tried to prove I live here by showing my signed 40-page electronic contract or my account that I pay rent through, they didn't even bother listening. Imagine how unorganized they must be that they literally lose a person on a lease!

The complex also has horrible parking, and it is very common to have your cars broken into. They won't bother to help remedy this situation either. The gates for the parking lot and the gates to enter through the front are sometimes locked and sometimes not.

There are also a lot of cockroaches in the kitchen area. I tried to call maintenance about it, but they never did anything. So, I took care of it myself by using insect killing powders and traps. Then, 6 months later after I've already dealt with the issue myself, they send me a letter demanding that I clear everything from my kitchen. I ignored it because I already handled the issue 6 months ago. So, they send another one by coming into my apartment and sticking it on my fridge. Long story short, there are cockroaches everywhere, and they take 6 months to get back to you about getting rid of them.

There was also a mass shooting here right in the pool area. Yet, the only thing the staff care about is making sure they get new people to rent the apartments that people vacated after the shooting.

If you value being treated with dignity, safety, or at least not getting shot while going for a swim, do not live here! It is not safe for families!<//review>

They forgot to send us the lease and are now threatening to no longer hold the apartment for us after not receiving said lease. Overall, they are unclear about what they want and half the information we send them has to be resent because they lose it. The people working this place are all rude and unprofessional. The worst part is if you want a guest over forget about parking. If you have the chance of living somewhere else that's not here, take it this place sucks.< /Review>

< Review>
I called every number in their office two days in a row to schedule a move out inspection and went to voicemail every time only to find that every voicemail box was full. Finally went into the office and they tell me I'm two days late in scheduling a move out inspection and will have to pay for an additional two days. They didn't care that I tried to schedule it earlier and told me to pay the additional fee. At least I won't have to deal with these people anymore :)<//Review>

This community sucks. The security system is stupid. You can NEVER find an empty guest parking. No trash can on the lower garage floor. No convex mirror in the garage. No gate code. No printers. Computers for public use constantly have no wifi. Gate opener sometimes don't work, and you need to go to the leasing office to tell them to give the permission to open the gate to the gym or the pool. Elevators are ALWAYS broken. Somebody has to report the problem, so they will start fixing the problem. The staff at the leasing office are apathetic. They only care about rent, money, and more money. I absolutely want to move out ASAP and never come back. This place is trash and totally not worth it. Plus, who wants to live in a neighborhood where killing and shooting took place?
Also, all the responses from the owners on this google review are BS because they are never willing to fix the problem permanently because they don't care.
Please avoid this neighborhood. Villas of renaissance is right next to it, and it's WAY better.</text>

They are incapable of doing anything.

We, me and my wife (both 67 years old)  spent six  month of my UCSD sabbatical at La Jolla Crossroads.
It was a great time for us to stay here in the friendly atmosphere of the managers who were always offering  help and provide us with excellent service answering all the  questions we have just  in time and very positive. Our personal thanks to Ami, Paul,  Alondra, Austin and Tami who made our stay so pleasurable!
We  also enjoyed  great location, sport facilities and swimming pools, clean and beautiful environment and definitely will stay  her again and for us  the human factor was the most fascinating feature of this place.</Review>

<Review>Terrible. I lived here for two years and it was awful. The halls always smelled like trash and vomit. There was a vomit stain on the hallway carpet outside my apartment that was never cleaned up. The leasing office people are passive aggressive and unhelpful. The walls of the apartments are paper thin and you can hear everything. I mean EVERYTHING. People’s business, dogs barking and everything. It’s terrible. Charged 2300 for a two bedroom apartment and then raised rent after the shooting.

If you’re attending UCSD and lookin to rent, people will say it’s only 10 minutes away from campus by car. True but it’s 45 minutes by bus and you have to take 2 buses, and the bus that runs from crossroads to utc runs less frequently now so it’d take even longer. Crossroads is super isolated and overall would not recommend it to anyone who’s looking for housing options.

Oh yeah, the apartments also have COCKROACHES.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

My car was broken into with my window shattered and my belongings taken.  As I was feeling violated and upset about the costs and time to fix and replace my belongings, I went to the leasing office to see how they could help.  The employees showed zero sympathy, told me I was parked in the same spot for over 3 days which is a viloation, and then told me to make sure i lock my doors and hide my belongings.  Wow, what exceptionally bad service.
In addition, the security guard said that car break ins have been happening often at this complex. Rather then telling me about a 3 day violation and providing "hindsight advice", perhaps they should have notified the tennants of this problem to get in front of it instead of hiding it.<//review>

I have lived here for some time and haven't experienced any of the issues with the office or staff that I am seeing described in these reviews. Every concern I have had has been addressed promptly, and with respect. My complaints are the cheap construction of the cabinets, appliances, countertops, etc. But it's cheap living for La Jolla, you get what you pay for. Ive had several maintenance emergencies which were all death with fairly quick.
The other issue is parking and this is a serious one. A three bedroom with a loft apartment can only purchase 2 parking spaces. Although there are some visitor spaces, I have NEVER seen one available. This forces people to park in the fire lane. They're building a parking garage now, hope its done soon!</text>

Living arrangements aren't bad, despite being a bit pricey for how far they are from campus. The real problem lies in apathetic staff, inefficient or at times non-sensical policies, and the prominence of better (less prone to gun violence) options in the area. We moved into la jolla crossroads because we didn't have time to find someplace decent, don't make our mistake!< /text>

<Text>Lots of noise!  Do not expect to get ANY rest if you are living here.  There are leaf blowers running anywhere from 2am to 5am nearly everyday throughout the week.  I haven't determined if it's coming from the building I live in or the neighboring garage but I went to the leasing office to complain and got nowhere.

They also roll the garbage dumpsters from the garage out to the street in the middle of the night so expect to be awoken from the loud squeeling and rolling from the dumpsters at least once a week.  Then when you manage to fall back asleep be prepared for leaf blowers.

Like many others have mentioned, when I went to the leasing office, I had to stand around for about 20 minutes before anyone would assist me.  Mind you there are a good 10 people or so visibly working in there.  They however are only concerned about signing people to new leases rather than taking care of the people living there.  When you do finally get attention, they do not treat you like they appreciate you being a resident.

Anyway, going back to my noise issue, they finally asked what I wanted and I explained.  They had me speak with a maintenance supervisor.  I'm not sure why they felt that would help and he of course was of no assistance. He said he would try to call the neighboring property owners but nothing has changed.

The neighbors above me sound like a herd of hipppos and I pound on the ceiling and they will pound back.  They also run their dishwasher and washer and dryer at all hours of the night.  I swear they must only sleep between 3am and 5am.

The "guest" parking spots are ALWAYS filled with the same cars.  Do not expect there to be a space if you have guests.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1505243403551, 'text': 'Dear Brian,  Thank you for taking the time to write this detailed review.

<Text>I was curious about the place. Checked it out on Google and horrible reviews.... You can see how serious management is about correcting situations when they just copy and paste their response to every negative post.

So then there's a shooting at this complex...read the reviews people are complaining about security at this place cars getting broke into etc. This is supposed to be a luxury apartment complex. THEY'RE GREEDY SLUM LORDS ! CLEARLY !  I hope they loose it all with a wrongful death payout due to their negligence. It sound like they deserve it all.<//Text>< Pictures>

To set the scene - My fiancé and I are not usually ones to complain and I’ve never reviewed anything in my life, but I felt obliged to warn others before living here. This was by far one of the worst living experiences I’ve gone through. Just to list a few day to day annoyances you will need to put up with, 1) Alarms are continuously going off. 2) Elevators are continuously out of order. 3) Water sometimes smells like sulphur when it comes out of the tap. 3) ~80% of community grills are out of gas. At the time of writing this none of the grills have the starter buttons – they are all missing. 4) Garage gates are broken more often than working. Anyone can walk into the garage. 5) We had a number of plumbing issues such as leaking water from our bathroom roof and pipe blockages. 6) Staff can be very rude and difficult to deal with. This is a generalization and some are very pleasant but I’d say 50% of the time you will need to deal with someone who just wants you gone. 7) There are many other smaller complaints related to the poor quality of the apartment itself but in comparison to the prior points they're not even worth mentioning...

On top of this there are the shootings and multiple occasions I’ve seen the police called to the apartments. Obviously I don’t hold the apartment complex responsible because they don’t have control. But it’s just something to keep in mind. There are definitely a few ‘suspect’ characters living in the complex and personally, I wouldn’t raise my kids here.

Finally I thought I should single out the extremely poor management of arranging move out inspections. This sort of tipped me over the edge to write this review and it was because the Crossroads apartment could not manage to stick to an appointment. Our initial inspection was missed twice – both times after confirming with the lady who manages these appointments the day prior. The second time this lady even hung up on me mid-conversation as I questioned why no one showed up. And for the final inspection they were an hour late to come to the apartment. It makes it quite frustrating when you leave work specifically to be home for the appointment.

Overall I wish I could give less than 1 star. I hope this helps some people. We got sucked in by the facilities, great gym and deceivingly high quality façade of the apartments and leasing office. Don’t make the same mistake…<//Review>

< review>
Can you imagine living here and paying your rent every month on time  year after year and then every time the lease renewal is up they try to hike up the rates 15% which is understandable because it's a business. But here's the part that's not understandable. You go on craigslist and you find the same exact floor plan for 15% cheaper than what you're paying and first month free and when you call them and ask them that you want to get the same deal other people are getting and they don't have to give you carpets and paint your walls they reject you. it's so unfair and if they put themselves in your shoes they would totally feel the same way so why not just treat people the same if people are smart enough and aware of a deal that's out there why not just give them the same deal you're giving everyone else? Maybe cause they don't give a damn about their current tenants and how loyal their tenants have been to them. they just want to try to outsmart their current clients. Wake up La Jolla crossroads. A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.< /review>

Avoid this place there many better options around. Their neighbor apartment complex (The Villas) is much better. The security is a big issue in this complex.<//Text>

This is one of the worst places you could ever live in.

1- Management is very difficult to deal with, once you sign the contact you will see all kind of problems.
2- Apartments are very hot inside, no air path
3- Very noisy construction
4- A lot of noise, you can hear your neighbors walking or showering even talking.

even if this is the only option you have, I still recommend against selecting crossroads<//Text>

<Text>I agree with a lot of the noise complaints already listed in the previous reviews. My biggest complaint with LJX is the parking. Guest parking is absolutely atrocious. I live with my wife in a 1 bedroom, meaning we have 1 assigned spot (which she parks in). Guest parking is constantly full, the parking structure that was recently built has not alleviated this at all. I was expecting that it would be open to all tenants, however never received a fob to get in. I like our physical apartment, it's roomy and we have a nice 1st story patio space. But having to be worried about whether or not I can park my car at my "home" is ridiculous.<//Text></record>

There has been a mass shooting at the pool, the car parked next to ours had the window smashed and items stolen (in our "secure" garage), the fire alarm has gone off 3x in the middle of the night and we've had to evacuate (there was never any fire), the floors and ceilings are so thin we are woken up almost nightly by noisy neighbors. We have had to complain on multiple occasions about noise at night, but to their credit, security does usually put a stop to it right away. I have also been talked down to and treated very rudely by the head of maintenance. So much so that my husband had to go down and speak to him. We were once left a very rude citation on our car warning us that if we don't park straighter in the spot that our car would be towed (we were never out side of the lines of our own assigned spots).

The elevator and the gate of parking lot did not work for more than a month, no one will fix it. Why this apartment charged so much from us, but did not fix anything. Looks like they want anyone to access in this building easily, and make another gunshot?<//review>< pics>

Horrible experience living 3+ year here.

2) They take tenants for granted and hike rates every year above market rate of increase (just take advantage of it hassle in moving out)
3) For any good reasons if u have a late rent pay by a day, they would not listen to u.

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>This place is terrible, from the shooting not to long ago to my motorcycle being stolen from inside the garage past the "security gate". Security is terrible and useless to the point where they saw as person who stole the motorcycle drive away with it. Iam very dissapointed with the staff, they have terrible people skills and will not listen to the issues of their residents. Not to mention the parking has a terrible system. I own two vehicles yet iam only allowed to have one assigned parking space so either my wife or I have to be scrambling for a spot in the "resident overflow" which would be fine if there were more that 10 spots for a single building and no I can't pay for another spot, I tried. The fact that I need a power of attorney to pick up my wife's mail is extremely ridiculous to me. I could go on and on about how terrible this place is, but if anyone does read this, I guarantee that this place is not worth the insane amount of money you will pay.

The worst organisation. Dont get fooled by the outward appearances, the maintenance sucks.
The staff at leasing office look to be running here and there without having any courtesy to help the walk-in guests. The parking garage is never cleaned and stinks all the time.
Ohh i forgot to mention, they are expensive, not at all worthy for what it looks like.<//Review>

Pros: Location (walking distance to shops, library, and malls)
Cons: Roaches + Unprofessional Staff

I have better things to do with my day than dealing with infestations or writing novels disguised as reviews - but here we are. If you'd like a slightly snarky take on the deets - ye shall read on...

ROACHES:
As soon as we moved in there was a roach infestation in our unit - presumably from the previous tenants.  As you can imagine I could immediately tell fun times were ahead.

When we made the maintenance request for the roaches and spoke to your maintenance crew over the phone,  maintenance confirmed that several other units at La Jolla Crossroads had roaches at that time.  My husband asked how this could happen and they said it was a normal occurrence due to units being empty and roaches go searching for food.

I was killing 4-10 roaches per day, during the day for OVER A MONTH -. It took a over a week for them to get to our unit and do the first treatment.  After the second treatment a week later it took a couple more weeks before I wasn't seeing roaches or new roach feces in my kitchen cabinets and drawers.

"Because nothing says yum like roach feces on your eating utensils."
-Said no one.  Ever.

We did not have a sanitary kitchen for OVER A MONTH (Nov 14- Dec 14). Yes, the unit currently is okay and I am happy about that.  There is no way there were no roaches prior to us moving in. After filling out 7 work orders your own maintenance guy said all the things that needed fixing should have been done prior to our move in - your third party vendors did not spend a lot of time in the unit.  I live in the unit 24/7 and while I only saw roaches a couple times a day (a few at time). I can easily see how your third party vendors could look over that if they are only in here for a couple hours at a time, especially when they looked over so many other things that should have been fixed prior to us moving in. This is coming directly from the mouths of your own maintenance crew.

OFFICE STAFF INCIDENTS:
On Saturday 1.21.18 I came into the office to get a shuttle pass.  My husband came in first and told the front desk I would come back with the form signed.  As soon as I walked in one of your leasing agents was very polite and helpful - I think his name is Rex but I'm not sure. I told him I was here for the shuttle pass and gave him the form I had already filled out.  He brought me to the front desk and I was standing behind him when one of your receptionists saw my signed form and said "Oh, the pest control girl?" with a smirk and tone that wasn't appreciated.  Rex seemed confused. The other receptionist is taller and saw me standing behind your leasing agent, got very uncomfortable and said "No pass, not pest" to try and sweep under the rug what just happened.  The girl who made the very unprofessional remark (which is apparently my office nick name among you when I'm not around) then saw me, got very embarrassed and did not acknowledge me at all.  She immediately looked down, then sat down and stared down at her desk.  No apology, just a lot of unprofessional awkwardness.  The other girl gave me my pass and I left.  *sigh*

What occurred on Saturday was really hurtful and uncomfortable.  It was mean and just shows a real lack of empathy and professionalism towards your residents/clients concerns.

I'm not here to win a popularity contest with your staff, but I also don't want to feel like I'm living on the set of 'Mean Girls'.

The negative talk about residents in front of other residents or potential residents isn't an isolated incident.  I have witnessed other agents talking negatively about other residents in front of me and others.

OVERALL:
Some staff is at least nice to your face.  If you are lucky enough to not have issues with your apartment the location is good.  BUT there are other apartments next door so if location is the only thing really selling the place I'd go next door I were you.</text>

I wish I could give them a zero star. I have lived here for 3 years, and I will say this is the worst place to live in La Jolla UTC area. People get attracted to this place because of flashy presentation in the beginning and of course the rents are little cheaper. But if you really want to have a peaceful life don't live here. Property managers are worst and rude. Lots of Indians and Qualcomm people come here without inquiring too much about the place. Being an Indian, I will advise other Indians to stay away from this place as they won't take your complaints seriously. The elevators in my building didn't work for atleast 4-5 months -- elevators have actually fallen in this apartment, and they won't take even that seriously. Garage doors don't work. There is no security in the parking lot. Cars regularly get broken in. No matter how much you complain, they will always take their sweet time. AND, forget about getting anything back from your deposit. They are a bunch of frauds who will make up bills and charge you so that you don't get anything back from your deposit. Don't fall for this place because of couple of hundred dollars cheaper rent in the beginning. This place is neither safe nor peaceful.< /Text>

After the shooting and killing  at this place, I am afraid to take my daughter to pool area or to the ourside. Silence of the management is very telling. They advertise, email, announce, post things for the smallest things, yet they say nothing on such a huge event,  how they allowed a psycho killer to live here, or at least some words that they care. They know this will explode in their face and they keep quiet.  They only care about money. All the stuff about the quality of appliances, maintenance issues , safety and parking issues are true. But nothing beats that you and your family can get killed by a neighbor. STAY AWAY. Don't be duped.<//review>

<Text>Unless you are bound by your job/school place RUN RUN RUN. In one day only 20 planes/navy jets/plane carriers passedby, day and night. Plus with the construction they have going on you feel you're like on a battlefield. We never had any unpleasantries  with the office people. They are quite helpful (specially Maria), not in everything though.  We have an issue with the upstairs neighbors. They are stamping pretty hard on the floors, our ceiling is shaking.  We brought it to their attention, nothing was done. We have the feeling our neighbors upstairs are running a carpentry business cause its an ongoing noise of drilling and cutting  stuff.< /Text>< gmap_id>

My car was broken into night 2 of me living there. I talked to the leasing staff, might as well been talking to a wall. They offered me a bottle of water. I had to drive with a broken window to Las Vegas that very same day for a trade show. No cameras, barely any protection for resident's property. They have one or two security people stretched super thin and ofcourse spending a couple bucks on cameras could have EASILY shown who did it and what car they got away in. I told the leasing people if they gave me $300 to put up cameras I can do it for them but there isn't a budget for protecting residents or their property but plenty of money to remodel that gaudy leasing office. Thought living in La Jolla was supposed to be better than this. Being down in the parking structure walking around it's pretty sketch at night it's like a slum.

Stay classy crossroads.</review>

<Review>Some packages go to their leasing office because their mail room doesn't have enough big mail boxes. That would be okay if it weren't for the fact that the leasing office will mislabel your package, so that when you go to pick it up, they won't be able to find it. If you know you got a package, and they say they don't see it, make sure to pester them about it because it's most likely that they mislabeled it. Overall, they should just get more mail boxes, so that the packages can just be dropped off there.</Review>< pictures>

< review>
Renters beware! La Jolla Crossroads takes advantage of its customers with added fees and horrible services. I encourage all people considering La Jolla Crossroads to look else where.

Don't get me wrong, I liked the apartment building. I and 3 other UCSD students lived in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom loft and the unit was beautiful. Unfortunately, this doesn't make up for its extreme shortcomings. The issues I had with the place are...

Deposit: This is the first place I've lived in that actually charged the residents more than their deposit when they moved out! The complex charged us for a deep clean and carpet replacement. I understand the deep clean, as that's pretty standard. However, the carpet change was completely absurd. We lived there for little over a year, and the carpet was new when I got there, and we didn't leave any big stains, so what gives? According to the California government, "normal wear and tear to carpets, drapes and other furnishings cannot be charged against a tenant's security deposit." Yet, I see the apartment changes the carpets in most units when residents move out. Apparently, the average person at Crossroads does more than "normal wear and tear."

Maintenance: They say that maintenance will come within 72 hours, which is a joke. Why make a promise they can't uphold? This is incredibly inconvenient when you have a clogged toilet or sink. They also tend to leave a mess when they leave. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful someone unclogged my sink. However, I would appreciate it if they didn't leave the contents that clogged my sink strewn across the kitchen floor.

Service: Some of the people in the leasing office are extremely nice, which is why I feel so bad writing poorly of them. However, they're overall inconsistent, and some of the employees can be incredibly rude. When I wanted to give my 30 day notice, I contacted the leasing office, and the employee working their at the time gave me detailed instructions which I followed exactly. When I gave the leasing office my 30 day notice, I ended up getting chastised by another employee for following bad instructions, and they threatened to fine me. If I followed bad instructions, perhaps it was the person who was working's fault, not mine? I was able to talk my way out of the fine, but that doesn't make up for the poor treatment I received.

I loved my time here, and thought the complex was beautiful. However, that doesn't compensate for how poorly I was treated. There are so many other great apartment buildings in the area, don't bother with La Jolla Crossroads.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>SCANDALOUS! ILLEGAL! I'm resident of La Jolla Crossroad. For 2 months, I requested for renewing my lease letter. I have received it on March 9th at my door with date of February 23rd on it, and deadline of April 10 for renew the lease. I legally have a right to receive this letter 6 weeks earlier and it has to be mailed to me. I have never received it in my mail, and received it 2 weeks later at my door. They increased the rent aggressively, my 1BR with Loft for $2650, while their 2 BR is $2200. Since March 9th that I received the letter,  I've began looking for the apartment. I have submitted my 30 day notification on March 12th for moving out at end of the month. They charged me for 10 days in April. However, they have not given me my legal right - enough time of six weeks to find a new place (2 weeks), as well as a month for submitting 30 days written notice. The real scenario is they just put the renewing lease letter at my door on March 9th, and as it is illegal to not giving it to tenant 6 weeks earlier, then they date it for Feb 23rd. When I talked with them today they claimed that it was at my door on March 2nd. First of all, it's still illegal to give a letter on March 2nd with date of a week before, secondly, it never could happen as we are living there and everyday we open the door, and the letter was at our door at March 9th. I am not responsible for paying rent because of neglect of fraudulent staff of La Jolla Crossroads. It's NOT ethical, and in all steps that you will be in touch with them this company will not doing anything ethically for you. They illegally changed the date of a letter for 2 weeks. They legally had to mail it to us, but as it was to late, they put it at our door. Everything with this company is ILLEGAL!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Dear potential renter,
Dont get too biased by the overly bad reviews posted here, and remember: happy tenants wont bother to comment here. Its only the frustrated ones (for whatever reason).
I usually dont post on forums like this one either, but I felt obliged to say that I had no bad experience when it comes to repair/maintenance of my unit and getting  my security deposit refunded (minus a minor fee for floor cleaning, which I didnt want to do myself). Of course, if you run down the place beyond recognition, you will have to pay, but other than that its not different to anywhere else.
I decided to move out after two years because I thought the rent (which increases every year) was not reflecting the unit quality any more. My unit was unrenovated when I moved in, with outdated kitchen appliances, and I suggest serious modernization before leasing it again. I also didnt like the sterile hotel atmosphere (the place is way too big), frequent fire alarms, constantly broken elevators (which sucks if you live on 5th floor), and an overall dirty impression on shared areas like parking garages and elevators. But if you can afford it, and be lucky enough to grab a top floor corner apartment with no or only one neighbor (what I had), it may be a decent-good deal. The fitness center is among the best you can get in the neighborhood.<//Text><user>102498959840592269268< /user>< pics>

I have just moved in this apartment and it’s not even a month and my car broken into last night ....I tried contacting the leasing office and they said they can’t do much about and asked me to report it to SDPD and Summit control who manages Crossroads Parking but when I contact Summit control they say there is nothing much they could do either, except reporting it... Every month they have lot many break in reported but  the leasing ofc is not bothered to do anything about it or at least get the cameras installed...

I will suggest all the families not to move in here for the safety of their loved ones...</Text>

<user_name>Arden Tran</user_name><Date>1519352933037<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I cannot overstate the sheer lack of customer service or care by the La Jolla Crossroads Leasing office. Such poor consideration and treatment of residents in regards to service scheduling, package handling, and maintenance request coordination is a strong indicator of poor management and leadership. There is absolutely no ownership for any situation that arises from their mishaps, and I am led to believe that they have grown numb to resident complaints or issues based on how they respond. For any professional living and working in the area, you're much better off finding a place elsewhere. For any consultants trying to find a place nearby for traveling work, I suggest you find another place. My company frequently has consultants fly in and stay at LJX for short term stays, but that may end soon. Their organization seems to view all residents as young, uninitiated college students who will take poor customer service and put up with their mishaps. For you college students looking for off-campus housing, there are much better places for the money elsewhere in the UTC area and beyond. I have waited a long time to make my observations and hopefully change my views on LJX, but frankly, every single incident involving their staff has ended in a conundrum usually due to their staff not following through, not coordinating (within reason) with residents or vendors or even their own people, and not having any sense of ownership in getting things done.

If the owner(s) of LJX is reading this, I want to let you know that this place could be fantastic! Yet it completely missed that mark and doesn't even come close to "good" due to the reasons mentioned above. Furthermore, it would seem that the current LJX model of having the Leasing office staff also be the point of contact for resident coordination with maintenance or 3rd party vendors is not working. My impression is that you have sales people trying to fill a service coordinator or project manager's role in servicing resident needs and logistics. It also is a horrible run-around trying to reach anyone with a sense of ownership in both heirarchy and attitude to get anything done.

To all you shopping around for your next residence or temporary stay in town for work, learn from my headaches dealing with LJX and find another option.</Text>< pictures>

This place is garbage. You cant smoke on your balcony or in front of your building. If you get caught you will here some bullshit from the guards. Telling you to get off the property to smoke. They also like to test the fire alarms constantly to the point that i dont know if should run or stay put. This place is also over priced.< /text>

< review>
Been living here for 3 years
Pros:
- Space (its huge)
- Maintenance (very quick and responsive)
- great price for the area (one can negotiate the price)
- Gym(good programs and size, trainers, avoid rush hours 6pm to 8pm at the gym as its difficult to find a machine)

cons:
- Summit Security (feel insecure with them rather than secure
- doesn't look like a trust worthy security company)
- management - they treat residents like pests, esp. the managers (few exceptions though)
- gas and water bill are shared by the whole building and the bill spikes(doubles) few times a year without any reason (neither SDGE/ISTA or La Jolla crossroads management can explain).
- Thin floor walls(walking after 10pm causes loud noises for downstairs neighbor and someone from summit security will show up midnight suggesting not to walk in the night)
- very difficult to find parking space for guest. There are a lot of pros but for me cons are very difficult to live with. Hence, my rating. So, its up to you to live here.<//review>

So Min Rhee< /user_name>
< text>
I moved in exactly five days ago and the experience has been horrible. The kitchen pipelines were blocked so I called the maintenance around 9:30pm. The maintenance man calls me on my cell phone and tries to convince me if he can take care of it in the morning. I had all these things to wash since I was still cleaning up the place so I asked him to still make an effort to come. He reluctantly arrived around 11pm  and after taking a look said he can't fix it and needs to call the plummer- that they need to open up the wall for the pipeline. The plummer that was supposed to come in 3 hours never appeared. The maintenance did not call me or notify me so I waited till 4AM in the morning. When I got in touch with the maintenance guy he said that the plummer isn't picking up the call anymore that he can't do anything. There seems to be issue in training the maintenance team. The unfortunate part for the resident is that it seems that the maintenance team is lacking desire to work and this attitude of "can't get in touch with the plummer so nothing I can do about it" was done in purpose because the team did not want to work Saturday afternoon. The whole maintenance team is not reliable and lazy, and does not care about customer service. Not to mention that the pipelines were having problems from day 1 and sink grinder did not work properly- which they should have checked before the new resident moves into the unit.
Also beware the drunk neighbors crying and screaming at each other past 4am!</text>

If you want to experience what it is like to live in a 3rd world country move in here.There are something like 1500 apartments with close to 8000 inhabitants surrounded by some of the busiest freeways and main roads you can imagine.And the Miramar air base is virtually next door.The gym would be lucky to cater for 50 people at once and the so called clubhouse shuts at 5.30pm every day.The leasing office is managed by poorly paid idiots doing the best that they are capable of.The 3 swimming pools are closed regularly for health reasons to remove fecal matter.The apartment walls are so thin you can hear the rats humping.Anyone with half a brain can gain access to the so called secure underground parking garages and break into or steal your car.And despite having a no pets policy dozens of dogs and other illegal animals have been smuggled in by tenants.You can only sign a 12 month lease because they want to jack your rent up every chance they get.There has been more than a few murders and criminals have been captured while living here.If this is supposed to be luxury living then I would hate to see what a dive looks like.Unless you are a complete loser then give this place a miss.<//review>

The maintenance is great, super friendly and quick, efficient service. Maintenance deserves more than 5 stars.

Everything else about management though? I wish I could give no stars. I don't even know where to start. Half of my apartment moved out months ago (did all the necessary paperwork and went through all the steps, got confirmation of release and everything) and they're still saying everyone's on the lease. We've been off the property for months now and it's still not resolved. Clearly there's some serious issues with communication and record keeping because this isn't even the first time we've had to reach out to them post-moveout for this same problem (and each time, we get reassured by the leasing office that everything's been taken care of but then it's back to square one again). Leasing office also only answer calls when it's convenient on their part and corporate never responds, period.

Tha garage gates are almost always broken, and I'm not even sure if this counts as a downside because the little clicker keys they give you to access the gates don't work half of the time so it's actually convenient (albeit not exactly safe for your vehicles; there's been a few break-ins that took advantage of this) when the gates don't work. Fire alarms go off so regularly it's actually an anomaly if you make it 3 consecutive days without one going off at some point.

There's a shuttle driver who's very pleasant and will drop/pick you off at various nearby locations and a pretty nice sandwich place next to the leasing office, but those are pretty much the only perks of living here.</review>< pics>

First Review ever I've ever done. I'm usually chill about most things, but this had to be done.

The Good:
Gym was nice, well when it was 6:30am when barely anyone is around.
Neighbors have funny WIFI SSIDs

The bad:
It might just be my luck, but every time I've walked into the leasing office 3:00pm - 4:00pm  there was no one at the front desk and I would have to wait around 10 min for a quick question.

In the gym, some dude would place a towel on a bench to save his spot while using a whole other machine. This happened way too often. Finally decided to just go at 6:30am or 3:00pm

From the perspective of living in building 9115:

Found dog poop in the hallway

Neighbors were/are loud

WiFi and cellular signal are terrible. You have competing WIFI signals and the walls are terrible for signal propogation. Might be the piping in the walls

They put more effort into towing cars away than anything else,
People speed through the garages (there is no sign indicating a speed limit)
Cars and trucks park in red-zones on the round-a-bout area in between building 9115 and the leasing office making it hard to drive around. This was especially the case when there would be ONE MASSIVE TRUCK rig leaving me thinking "how the hell... did this guy fit this thing in here?!"

Elevators break down about every 2-3 weeks ESPECIALLY the ones closest to Judicial Dr.

People smash up the elevator buttons and so when you press them, it may seem like they elevator may be out of service, but you'd have to apply  hella force on the buttons (go super sayian 3 overlayed with kio ken x100)

A so called "Gated Appartment" yet the garage gates were broken, elevator gates were broken, key fob sensors were broken for half the year so anyone was able to get in. "Security"...

People are too lazy to actually put their trash down the trash chute which made the hallway smell like something died and also attracted roaches (Felt bad for the cleaning staff)

Emergency exit signs were smashed up

Fire alarm had gone off several times over the year (probably someone trying to be the next Chef Gordan Ramsay )

It has luxury in the name, but felt ghetto while living there. 360 Degrees is way more luxury than crossroads. Casa Mira View is way nicer than crossroads, but those speed bumps though

The Ugly
And then there was that shooting in the swimming pool right next to my building... Now there is a child left without a mother. Sad.<//review>

<Text>This is one of the worst apartments. Their service is bad and more over they towed my car that have a overflow permit. It was one of the expensive apartments and claimed to be gated community but any one can enter the apartments as some of the main garage gates are wide open with full public access.< /Text>< Pics>

I have been living here for 5 years now. Too expensive for amenities and service. only plus point is UTC location. I chose this place only because its close to office and not because of good living experience.

Don't rent if planning to renew your lease more than a year. They increase the rent every year  while the amenities keep getting crowded by their own new sistercommunity members next block.

(1) Apartments are getting older needin frequent repairs for microwaves, bulbs, water leakage, boiler/hot water cut offs,

(2) high electricity /water bills due to shared meters even though u keep tab on ur usage,

(3) small gym crowded with sister community folks,

(4) horrible guest parking,

(5) no cleaning of parking lot,

(6) always some or the other construction, repair work hassle, noises.

(7)Strict policies for rentals agreement but when it comes to amenities no seriousness.

(8)Lived here For 5 years for proximity to work but not worth it for the amount of rent. Hotel/Motel like feel, no home feel

(9)they change lease duration from 12 months to 14 months possibly to make sure u rent next year in summer with high rental Rates

(8)Elevator out of service for 2 months, apathy of management towards Tenants by not informing of time frame or elevator readiness, multiple complaints falling on deaf ears. Took more than one month to escalate with corporate office.

(9) bearable for young bachelor folks due to basket ball court, Gym, close to university but not recommended for families

-(10) perennial steep price increase on rent
-
facilities only getting worse, frequently flooded racquetball courts- or private gym classes in raquetteball court, the roadside parking which used to be good for guests is now taken away by new community (360) behind it
-they make you pay for parking security and don't own the breakins, guests ended up parking almost a mile away and had to walk
-lot of people knock on the door , some looking for help, some with fake charity etc. no peephole in some apartments door
-laggy maintenance service-haven't heard about fixing broken microwave, Oven, ceiling light, toilet needing more than 2-3 flushes every time
-despite above issues, management is arrogant and stubborn
-during lease renewal they would ask for processing fee and $100 fogging if new person (even spouse) is to be added on the lease. but they didn't even mention free carpet cleaning on lease renewal. such a sneaky attitude< /Text>

I also wish I could give this company 0 stars. They are by far the worst Slum Lords I have ever dealt with.  This is an extremely disorganized property management.  They rarely ever answer the phone or get back to e-mail. They try to nickle and dime you every chance they get and are extremely unfair and unjust.  Not only did I get hundreds of dollars of extra charges they tried to charge me when I moved out. But I also had Mold growing in my closet, which destroyed my clothes and shoes the property would do nothing about it saying it wasn't their fault.  They are so unhelpful, I would never recommend living here to anyone.</Review>

<Time>1512967166271< /Time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>If I had option, Surely I would give score as 0 or negative. In short If you want to save your time and money, you can find better options in the area compared to here.  This place is not worth of the money you pay. Happy now that I left this terrible place and saved my life ( Picked wrong complex to live and unfortunately did not read the reviews throughly that time).

If have time to know why in detail, please read the following:
When you move in, for first months, some people give high score, but after some time you can ask their opinion about the place and you will here that La Jolla Crossroads is terrible place to live. If you see other reviews, you can see repetitive and same manager response because they do not care anybody to take a look and response to each person's comment specifically (It is their job but they do not do it) . On the other hand, They lie and do not believe in their apologies because when you approach them they will not handle your concerns.  By the time, I learnt when some place review is bad, surely believe in the reviews as people spent time to share their experience then you do not repeat and have the same.

Now, why you will hate this place in more detail?

1) Quality of apartments are terrible. You can hear when your neighbor walks, talks, and etc. Terrible interior design as the inside not designed good and not utilized space efficiently. Dark room makes you depressed by the time.  Not enough closets. Not strong hangers of closets, and etc. .You need to live to see more.
2) Most of the time, elevators not working and you need to walk away to find the working one
3) Poor quality appliances.
4) Leasing office is nice when you want to sign the contract. After that, when you approach them, you will hear sorry or we changed our policy. When you approach them to pick up your package, they miss some of your stuff and by chance you will find out you have a package left there.
5) Terrible security. The ridicules part is this. When you come to see complex they tell and show you that the complex is secure and nobody from outside can trespass. However, after you start living, you will see there are a lot ways open to enter the garage and apartments because there are other open paths ( Why you have gates and opened some parts of the building? This property is fake gated). Other apartments in the area definitely are really gated and you cannot enter to the property without having a key or code.
6)  They had shooting and after that they started to increase the prices. Interesting!
7)Your deposit is gone.  When you give it to them,  forget it even if you leave the apartment in the perfect condition. They will give the home with old appliances and not clean  condition and ask you new apartment when you want to leave.
8)  People smoke in the balconies, but the property is mentioned as smoke free. Sometimes, you will hear fire alarm and you need to evacuate for no reason (We had a it sometimes 6 am in weekend).

9) and ...

Now, it is up to you to waste your money and time here or not</text>< Pics>

<text>DO not ever expec to have guests, the guest parking spaces are consistently filled with the same cars day and night.  People living in the apartments are obviosly parking there.  Management could care less.

Resident smoke in and around the parking structures.  Nice that they are not doing it int heir apartment but not so sool when you have to walk thru it and gag on the way to your car.  Management could care less.

The paint crew and carpet installers continously park in the main aisle of the parking structure blocking the flow of trafic and causing a hazzard.  management could care less.

The gym is overfilled and I highly doubt half of the people that use it even live there.
There is a lot of late night activity at the pool.  Parties lasting until 3am or later are common throughout the week and weekend.

Elevators are frequently out of service so do not get an apartment on a high floor unless you feel like exercising.

The leasing office is ran like a large corporation.    They immediately attack hoping that you are there to rent a place and when they find you are not, they are rude.  Do not ever plan on entering and having them know whom you are and that you are a resident.  They are only nice to the people that are there to lease.

The key fobs never work correctly, be happy if they work at 2 of the doors but not all.  It takes about a half an hour each time to reprogram them and there are typically a few people waiting each time to have their fobs reprogrammed.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>We have been living here for the past 5 years and let me just first say, that MARIA ROSAS of leasing office is the only person I can give a 5 stars. She is absolutely amazing in customer service. She makes us feel that we belong here and we deserved to be respectly!  Thank you Maria!

We have quite a few maintenance issues which they took care of it mostly. So I would say those maintenance guys are also doing a good job.

My biggest issues at this apartment is the walls and ceiling between neighbors. We can't stand the noises of our neighbors upstair. There are nights that we can't sleep at all due to kids running around in the middle of the night. Calling the security is pretty much useless. They response 2 hours after we have called them and when everything is alredy calm. Oh, the massive construction going on is no fun for us. We have to shut our door and windows to avoid their loud noises. Since there is no good air circulation on our unit, we have to turn the AC on. Which in return makes our electric bill crank so high.

Other than that, everything is fine. I am sure there are always something in every place you go</Review>< Rate>

Thank goodness I had signed a sub-lease lasting less than 10 months. Can't wait to get out of this ill-managed, poor excuse of 'luxury living'. The big advantage of excellent location and neighborhood is squandered by grossly dumb and incompetent staff. Residents have no direct recourse to seek help (onsite management apparently has no control or power and there is no phone number or physical office for customer service/ HQ!). They claim that Email is the only wait to reach support which is pretty much a scam since the email response is always a standard 'Sorry, no, can't help you'.

Apartment themselves are decent quality but there is almost no air circulation and frequent bug issues. Outdoors is well maintained (I suspect to keep duping potential tenants) but one look at the state of parking lot exposes the true nature of facilities. I can go on and on, but essentially this place is good only for someone who just needs a place to crash in night and never needs to use their customer service.</Text>

Cons: floorplans were designed by the most unqualified, idiot architect - have fun with two doors not being able to be open at once, placing furniture, and other subtle slightly annoying nuances. Kitchen appliances are AWFUL, they nickel and dime you in a legal but not very ethical way on bills (our water, trash, everything but wifi and electric seem to be not metered per apartment, but divided equally among all units in the building? We were charged for water/etc in a month we were gone for the entire month/few months, and at the same amount as when we are home and using the water). The no pet rule isn't applied at all or too many people don't understand that calling your unbehaved pet a service animal when it's not is demeaning to those of us to have a service animal (I do. The way you tell is if they have their harness on saying they're a service animal when out and about - this is day one of their training and certification stuff) - it also means you don't know what level of fleas or hair might be in your apartment when you move in because they obviously don't clean the place before you move in (our place certainly wasn't).

however, it's a good place for what you're paying. I wouldn't mind living here another year if I didn't have to relocate cities.

EDIT: YIKES! since moving out I had to deal with getting the deposit back and apparently they screw everyone over. The apartment was impeccable, barely lived in. The walls were never painted and nothing was ever hung on them. There was zero carpet damage and I even had a professional come in beforehand just to be sure. It took 4 appointments for a maintenance guy to actually SHOW UP for the inspection, and he walked around said it looked immaculate and no repairs would be needed, and left. No paper was given for repairs (law in california unless nothing needs to be done), and then $340 was taken off our deposit for "wall painting" and "repairs." Not only that but it took them 35 days to get us our check - that's illegal in California. They didn't even send it out until the 28th. If a landlord doesn't have a check in your hands in 21 days (no excuses) they have to pay you double the deposit. I'm heading to small claims court this week over this bs - but I don't live in San Diego anymore so you can imagine the hassle. Before this I would've rated them 4stars, but with this edit I rate them 2 star.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
The leasing office is the worse part. They have misplaced 2 of my packages. I have had them tell me several times that I am wrong and my package is not there when in the end it was. I went in at 9:12am and they open at 9:30 being a resident to just pick up a package. The man at the desk said we are closed till 9:30 and I said oh well can I just pick up a package and he just looked at me and kept talking on the phone. Their door was unlocked and it looked occupied. If you don't want residence in there keep the door locked. I feel just because I'm young I don't get respected. I am not a fan of this place at all. It is odd  walking to my apartment from my car. I have not seen one security camera. It claims its a gated community but garage gates are open all day sometimes. You can get into a apartment easily. The lack of respect in the leasing office is ridiculous.< /Review>

They forced me into switching out the day that I moved in. I was given a smaller unit and lied to that "there are no other options". They then proceeded to say "or you can take your deposit and leave". After months planning in advance they pulled a switch to a worse room at the same price. They were incredibly rude about it and YOU should avoid this place at all costs.</text>

Guest Parking is a nightmare! Limited slots and that too filled by resident's additional car, zero parking space outside the apartment as well as streets<//Review>

I pray you never have to deal with the people in the office. They are slow, not very knowledgable, and have no multitasking abilities. They have security services but we still manage to have a ton of vehicle burglaries.  This company also manages a lot of the other complexes in the area so expect the same from the other locations<//text>

We manage a large community and if there is delayed service, we are most likely helping someone that called right before you.  It is our goal to get back to everyone as fast as we can.   Please know the following regarding vehicle thefts:   La Jolla Crossroads has several buildings with several parking garages.  A security guard at every entrance and exit is impossible.  We always recommend to our resident to not leave anything valuable in your car and do what it takes as a car owner to minimize theft of your vehicle such as an alarm system or steering wheel lock.  Car theft in San Diego County is an epidemic.  Please know it is not a landlord’s fault that someone steels your car.   We do sympathize and know it is not a situation we want any of our residents to be in at any time.  We do work with the local policy agency to help monitor our communities.'}< /Response>< gmapID>

The pictures on the map looked good but upon getting my food, it was mediocre at best. The female cashier was eating, what appeared to be her breakfast, on the hot line while the cook was preparing the food. Sucks, because the restaurant looks really nice on the inside. With some minor changes it could be a great place to get food.< /Text>

Food was so plain, only thing you could taste was the salt on the burger, fries tasted like nothing. Cheap price for cheap service. Would not eat here again sorry. Really wanted to like the food but that didn't happen...</review>

2 shrimps on my taco, 3 would be better.
I was satisfied with my carne Asasa burrito, I love the option of me adding the stuff to the burrito. Other places give you a dry burrito, here it's perfect and I can add more veggies. Keep it up guys.<//Text>

Horrible food!!! I ordered a bean & cheese burrito & the tortilla was hard,pinto beans were whole and half black ,cheese was not melted at all,the guy next to me ordered tacos and he bit into one and threw the rest in the trash and said they were nasty,even the fries were horrible! How do you mess up fries?</review>

It's the opposite of Panda Express: Mexicans in the front and Asians in the back.
I'm confused as well, is it a Chinese restaurant or Mexican.
Good tacos tho, just expensive: 2.25.
Two stars for trying.</Text>

So i ordered at 5:15. Its currently 5:36. Still no sandwich. One singular sandwich. Like 6 people that ordered after me have all gotten their food. Good thing I'm not a truck driver or anything.</Review>

My boyfriend and I went to Wendy's and got the new Pretzel bacon pub double cheeseburger and the pub fries abd we ended having an allergic reaction to the food.  We had to take benadryl. Food tasted great but proceed with caution.<//text>

This restaurant is certainly one of the tastiest place to eat in the region. Every time I visit this place I am greatly happy. They preserve their very high  level service and the topmost level of meals  they give. You no doubt will love this place. Highly  recommended.< /Review>

Out of chocolate frosties and staff was overworked to the bone, but they did the absolute best to compensate for whatever they were missing and (for the cards they've been dealt) did a great job!

For all of the COVID safety extremists, the inside is adjoined to the gas station convenience store and the dining area is cleared out to provide plenty of room to stay 6 (...dare I say 8-10) feet apart from any other human.</Text>

Slowest Wendy's I think I've ever been to. 8pm and 3 cars in front of us, took 15 min to even get to the window. Got our food, checked the bags and left. Go to eat our food only to find out the fries and nuggets were COLD! Very disappointing, especially since we wasted $20 on it, pitiful excuse for a "fast" food restaurant, at least this location!!!</text>

Do not accept mobile order or mobile pay, will not accept in-restaurant coupons from the Wendy's app. Don't bother stopping here if you are hoping for deals or such.< /Text>

Came here at 5 in the morning, they let us order nuggets even though it was still "breakfast". Ordered the spicy chicken nuggets, they were great. Came out in 3 minutes nice and hot.<//review>

<Text>Could only order from one side of the menu then paid 12 bucks for chicken sandwich combo to get cold fries. You got really got to stop trying to get over on truck drivers when you feel like we won’t notice. Then waited 5 mins for someone to come back just to fix my order. By the time I got fresh fries, my sandwich was cold. Promise I won’t bother you ever again</Text><Gmap_id>0x80e9efe6decc5415:0xf7f758cf2d385168< /Gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
If you saw the prices on this menu you would think you were in an airport. The employees handle money then food without washing their hands. Do yourself a favor and keep driving 10 minutes and get some fast food which won't cost you $15 a person.< /Review>

They are no different than all the rest of business that take advantage of America's truck drivers for the simple fact that they know we have limited parking available to us due to the size of our rig's , any other Wendy's a Dave's double is 4.89 and it comes with cheese , just the sandwich not a combo and at this price gouging Wendy's the Dave's double is be 5.99 + 1.00 for cheese + tax for grand total of 7.65 for the sandwich alone not a combo meal.</text>

Open 24 hours, sure, but the grill is shut down every night from like 11pm to 5am "for cleaning" so no burgers at night, just microwaved chicken. Staff has gotten better since launch but I've still received entirely wrong orders with no sauce. I've resorted to not eating from fast food in Lebec and Gorman, as the McDonald's in Gorman and this Wendy's seem to have had the same bad staff at one time or another.< /review>

The food was delicious. As good as it looks. It reminded me of when I was a little girl and going to eat with my Grandma. Service was good. The quesadilla was so good.</review>

A co-worker invited me for lunch and I enjoyed this place. From the outside looks like a small place. They do provide parking in the rear. We entered through the rear up some stairs. Once inside we were greeted and given the choice to select our seats.

We sat down and we were given the menus(photo avail.). I asked for a Ensalada drink, two pupusas(revueltos with jalapeño), and an order of chicharrón (light fried). I enjoyed these menu items very much.

No pressure from the server to up and leave. I enjoyed myself very much. Will I return? Yes please!

Thank you.< /text>

<Review>One of the better places in LA to get pupusas.

Had the debate with my wife over street pupusas for 1.50 or molcajete for 3-3.50 per pupusa.

I told her 1.50 for an inconsistent flavors and a small sized pupusa with mediocre ingredients on the street and potentially have a " none enjoyable" dinner or go to this restaurant and have a somewhat premium Salvadorean pupusa that you will 100% enjoy at a slightly higher cost.

Guess what the answer was..

Oh and get Get large sides of condiments for the pupusas it goes a long way.

This place is generally consistent with their taste, the employees are very nice all the time and the restaurant is a nice place if you can find a seat during covid times.<//Review>< Pictures>

My favorite pupusa place. I suggest ordering by phone and picking up. It takes about 30 mins for your order to be ready. The pupusas are a good size and they aren't stingy with the filling.< /Review>

This was my first time coming here and I'm blown away by there customer service!! The food was delicious!! My mom ordered some popusas revueItas and I ordered vegan popusas with beans and vegan cheese and a hot chocolate with soy milk. I original accidentally ordered popusas revueltas with vegan cheese and beans thinking that was the name of the popusas that have vegan cheese and beans but the kind cashier informed me that those popusas had chicharon in them so it wasn't vegan. Even though it was my mistake for ordering them in the first place, the cashier was super kind and generous in making me another order of the correct vegan popusas without charging me. You can tell this business and their workers truly cares about customer service and satisfaction! Also their hot chocolate is heavenly!! I've never tasted hot chocolate that good in my life! It was so good I had to order another one for my mom and due to the previous mishap of me ordering the wrong popusas which again was completely my fault, the cashier's made me a second hot chocolate without charge. I can't stress enough how understanding and caring these restaurant workers are! Will definitely be coming more often whenever I'm nearby!<//text>

<Text>If you love pupusas and you're vegetarian, you're in luck here.

I fell in love with the veggie friendly pupusas. I can't wait to visit this restaurant again. I've been dreaming about their spinach pupusas ever since. Its not that expensive either! Everything was incredibly delicious.</Text>< Pics>

The one on Hoover Street is good but this is the best one in terms of ambiance, taste, and price. The pupusas at $2.50 a piece is a great Buy. You might wait a little bit for table service but it's worth it all the way!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This is one of those places that was a pleasant surprise. We were looking for some place for breakfast and took a chance. I was not familiar with Salvadoran food.
The food was tasty and, although it didn't look like much, I was not able to finish my plate and stayed satisfied well into the day.
If we are back in the area and need a meal, it will be on the short list of choices.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Los Molcajetes is a large part of my family. My mother took us to another location when we were younger. My siblings and I love this place and now bring our own family. They have vegan options for my husband. Their breakfast is delicious but the pupusas are always the best. The atmosphere can be better. They play music too loud and you have to yell your conversation which can be hectic at times. Creation a very loud setting. Service is great.</Text>

<review>This used to be a good place to eat, but not anymore. I ordered 14 pupusas over the phone and I told the girl who answered the phone to put 3 pupusas on each container and she told if we use more than 2 containers, we are going to charge you extra. I think its about time to look for another place who really treat a customer with respect.< /review>< Gmap_id>

My family and I use to order from here alot   over the years, but the quality of the pupusas and customer service have downgraded alot over the two  years, must be new management or different cooks , I can tell the difference, food doesnt taste the same anymore.

Great service all the way from the start as we came in we were greeted and seated. The food was awesome and if you want true authentic Salvadorean food this is it. The popusa was the best I have tried to date and el Pulgarsito plate we ordered comes with a lil of everything and all was very good. We will definitely be coming back soon.< /Review>

<text>Today for lunch ,I had the taste for for those delicious Los Molcajetes pupusas ( by the way  at this location the best in town) But the music was so laud and out of tune with an El Salvadorean pupuseria . I requested to please lower the volume because I could not listen to my friends conversation. The kind waitress address the owner with my request to what he replied to me that he would not lower the volume because the music was for every costumer not just for me. I totally agree to his remark , any way this is his business and he can decide how to handle it just a word of advice :
A business can only continue have success when patrons feel welcome,
lunch time is moment when working people want to have a relaxing meal
there is a difference between weekend crow and I am going to get my lunch break crow. I know my opinion is of little importance for this business owner but I think I had to let it go out of my system because today was my last time there and, I walked out of that place with out my lunch GOOD BY LOS MOCAJETES for ever.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This place has great Salvadorian food. I've ordered Pupusas here a few times and they're pretty tasty. The one thing about them is they make them to order, so expect your food to be ready in 40-45 minutes after you call. I have never dined in, just picked up takeout. My last order had bean and cheese pupusas, regular cheese, and  Carne Asasa fries, which were really robust and tasty!

If you have time to wait and want some good pupusas, I'd recommend. Parking is street parking and it's right on Temple so it can be busy, but if you're just grabbing food it's pretty simple.</Text>

I have mixed reviews. At times it's great, at times it's not. But i still go because they dont charge more like these other places. And its more homey, than others. That look like a nail salon with chairs.< /text>

This place is absolutely amazing! The papusas are out of this world delicious. I got the papusas with beans, cheese, and pork. Cooked perfectly and melted to perfection. I live how this food is made around the flavor complexity. The waitress was so helpful and so kind. She never left us hanging and was quick to refill what we needed. I will continue to keep going back to this place over and over.<//review>

The food is some of the best Salvadorian food but wait times are too long even though most of the time there isn't a lot of customers. Save time and order ahead!<//Text>

<Review>Second time here. First time was great, so decided to come back. I don't think I'm coming back after this last experience. Took about 15 min to get our drinks, another 15 to just get chips and salsa. Nevermind the food, it took about 30-40 min. Finally got to our table,and most of our food was cold &incomplete. By this time our group is so hungry,  we ate.  Taste was okay, but we never got our complete order even after reminding our waitress 2x. Idont think I'll b back. Very dissapointed.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c76cc101ca2f:0xab1ffdb60ad3ee6d< /Gmap_id>< response>

<review>Theres an upper and lower area to sit. The upper area was already crowded with a small table only of 2 and theres was 3 of us, they wanted to keep their lower dining room area clean I guess and didnt let us sit there when I requested that I wanted a bigger table. The lady was so rude and gave me the worst customer service ever. That is unacceptable. I've been coming here for so long and was never treated this way</review>< Time>

A bit pricey $3 a pupusa. But so worth it. The size is big not your ordinary pupusa size and they taste really good. I'm very picky when it comes to pupusas  because no one compares to grandmas home made food.<//Review>

< Review>
Great food, made to order always. Husband and I always get two cheesw pupusas and one pan con pollo. Very taste. Big size portions. Pupusas are bigger comparing to other places. You won't regret coming to try this place. Staff not so friendly but you come here for the food not the staff. Parking in the back or on the street. Hard to park but we always find parking out on thw street.  It's never full inside but always has customers</Review>

Love the customer service and the beef soup and pupusas are the best. I gave you 4 stars cause I didn't like the pan con pollo. Other than that great atmosphere.<//review>

They take very long to serve people. I was there ordering to go and saw two couples(at different tables) decideing to leave because the lack of service that have and a lady complaining she has been waiting an hour for her food. But the food is alright .... I guess

I had to wait more than 40 mins for 5 pupusas to go< /text>

They've got the BEST pupusas in town! Fresh and full of meat/cheese. Most places have less meat and a lot of dough...not this place. Their fried yuca and pork are also delicious. Every time I get my pictures framed across the street, I always stop by this place. Yumm!</review>

< review>
Well love the food from here the taste it's very good and if Something doesn't taste or look good. Right away they fix the issue. Yesterday I was there and it was so loud. The people were talking way to loud. And the English music didn't fit the ambient in the restaurant and so we asked if they could change the music to Spanish and so they did and the environment felt so much better👌🏽
Bueno la comida de aqui save nut Buena y si algo no save o se Ve mal en el mismo ratito areglan el problema. Ayer estube ahy y abia mucho ruido la gente hablaba tan fuerte y la musica en ingles no dava con el ambiente del restaurante y pedimos q cambiaran la musica a español y lo isieron y el ambiente se sintio mucho mejor 👌🏽<//review>

<review>My wife and I have always been on the search for good and authentic Mexican food since we moved from California in 1978. This place serves authentic street food!
I had menudo and it was the best I have had outside of Mexico and the Southwest. I also had an outstanding cheese and jalapeno tamale. My wife had a chile relleno which is the best she has had in the East.
The chips are not as fresh as I would like  but the salsas are outstanding.
We ordered two burritos to go. Wow. The spicy pork is outstanding. The Chorizo is equally as good.
This is a classic hole in the wall restaurant. It is not a place for a first date but it is the kind of place where you know you will get good food. It is not fancy. The services is nice.
The prices are incredible when you look at the quality of the food.
I rank it on equal par with Rincon and Los Portales.
Los Molcajetes makes this ex-Californian very happy< /review><resp>None<//resp><Rate>4< /Rate>< Pics>

Poor service! Why are they open if they're not going to provide good service! Even better restaurant at Pasadena with better food provides better service! Not to mention they take forever to give you your food! Also, the restrooms smell bad! Gross first time here and last time here! If I could I would give them 0 stars instead of 1!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Now I went to eat there very tasty food! But the service very bad! The waiter never offered me another cup of coffee and the MR on the next table spoke English and got five cups of coffee I felt uncomfortable.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent place, very nice atmosphere. Good concept of the premises, that is, finishes, paintings, decoration. Very clean. They have a 3-screen circuit displaying their menu and presentation of tourist places in El Salvador. They have parking located behind the premises, a bit small. They have toilets for multiple genres. Waiter very friendly and courteous. Excellent taste of pupusas. We got snack while our order was. They have takeaway service and vegan foods.

(Translated by Google) One of the worst experiences in restaurants. We waited more than an hour for 4 pupusas .... People who were arriving after we were being served and serving their food before us. They ignored us completely. They just took my cold coffee and forgot us. I hope this is for people who want to come here who know that their food is good but know that they should not get to eat here if they are hungry.

(Original)
Una de las peores experiencias en restaurantes. Esperamos mas de una hora por 4 pupusas.... Gente que estaba llegando después que nosotros estaban siendo atendidas y sirviendoles su comida antes que nosotros. Nos ignoraron completamente. Sólo me llevaron mi café frío y nos olvidaron. Espero esto sirva para la gente que quiera venir aquí qie sepan que su comida es buena pero que sepan que no deben llegar a comer aquí si tienen hambre.<//Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) The very nice restaurant the good pupusas depends on the cook that this, but my recommendation is the comfort of the consumers is first and that they send you where to sit is not good because you are not free to choose your place, but only where they they want to sit that for me is something awkward especially when you have children thanks

El restaurante muy bonito las pupusas buenas depende la cocinera que este , pero mi recomendación es la comodidad de los consumidores es primero y eso que te manden a donde sentarse no esta bien porque no eres libre de escojer tu lugar , si no solo donde ellos te quieren sentar eso para mi es algo Incómodo sobre todo cuando uno tiene niños gracias<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very bad service, simpler food for a restauran, I came because a friend recommended it and very badly I ordered roast meat and a grilled meat with salt and pepper without fresh flavor they were not given without straw and the glasses felt very smelly to chlorine por and if that was not enough, the waitress left us lying and then went to pick up two people who were eating only because the table was too big and I needed it 😮😮😮 for me a lack of respect I will never go back there.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio, comida más simple para un restauran, vine por que un amigo me lo recomendó y muy mal pedí carne asada y una carne a la plancha con sal y pimienta sin sabor fresco no los dieron sin pajilla y los vasos se sentía mucho olor a cloro 🤬🤬y por si fuera poco la mesera nos dejó tirados y después fue a levantar a dos personas que estaban comiendo solo por que la mesa era muy grande y la necesitaba 😮😮😮 para mi una falta de respeto jamás volveré alli.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) From My Favorite Places To eat Salvadoran Food. The Pupusas are very Delicious. But those of Rice flour. The price is in the average. Sometimes the music is too high. The service is a bit slow. But it's worth waiting for. Always clean and good atmosphere.

<text>(Translated by Google) Very bad attention ... first and last time I visit that place ... the meat d poor quality and without flavor ... there is a waitress who for winning more tips came a table for 7 people and as she had no space .. He picked up two boys who were already eating to seat the other people !!!! The vrd I found very impolite xq if I had done it ... at that moment I'm away! 🤨🤨 There is no ethics! There is no quality !! And not good service !!!!! 😡

La vrd me pareció de muy mala educación xq si a mi me lo hubiera echo... en ese mismo momento me largo!!!🤨🤨 no hay etica!! No hay calidad!!

(Translated by Google) The food is very good, but the wait is too much, they do not have enough staff and the one that attends you, charges, serves, and I think cooking also would not come back.

La comida esta muy buena, pero la espera es demasiada, no tienen suficiente personal y la que te atiende, cobra, sirve, y creo que cocina también no regresaría.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The food is fine but the service is super lousy the waiter put my soda on I come from afar and really from the beginning to the end an ominous service I really would not recommend this place there are many better and with a great service the truth already lost a customer that has times getting to eat here lousy very bad service indeed.

(Original)
La comida está bien pero el servicio es súper pésimo el mesero metiro mi refresco encima vengo desde lejos y en verdad desde un principio hasta el final un servicio nefasto la verdad no recomendaría este lugar hay muchos mejores y con un servicio estupendo la verdad ya perdieron un cliente que tiene tiempos llegando a comer aquí pésimo muy mal servicio en verdad.</Review>
