The back up person in the Bulk Mail area is horrible. Susie is our regular staff person and she does a FABULOUS job. However when she goes on vacation her back up person has zero customer service skills and she does not have a clue about the business.</text>

They only get 1 star because I have to give that to rate them. I sent a package to CA from TX. Was suppose to be delivered on Dec 23rd. It was marked as on it's way to next destination from Dec 21st to Dec 31st. Now it says that the package is still at this location and ready for pickup. It never made it to Corcoran. My cousin finally got a letter saying to call to make arrangements.  No one has answered or returned a call since last week. At this point I'm getting the run around because the post office in Corcoran that was suppose to receive the package cant seem to get answers either from all the emails they have been sending to try and help me.</review>

If your expecting a package you end up with a note left in your mailbox saying you missed the delivery! Then you call about it and have to wait on the phone for thirty mins to explain your carrier was too lazy to bring your package to your door. Now I have to wait two extra days for a supply I need for work. Not pleased with this situation at all.< /review>

Most (nearly all) packages arrived damaged. This combined with what seems to be the going through of obvious financial documents (torn open, resealed) makes me afraid there is active theft going on. I fear for my identity because my address is served by this location. If it were in the cards currently, I would consider moving just to get away from this post office. If you plan on sending anything sensitive through this office, do it in nondescript packages.< /Text>

<Text>This is the main Post Office in town and is not open on Saturday when other locations are. It does not have a place to drop off packages after hours and does not have the automated postage machine. Some other locations in town have as many as two machines and drop boxes. I would have gone to one of them but this location, on Pegasus, was the closest today. I unfortunately thought that being the main location it would be open on Saturday or at least have a package drop. Very disappointing.</Text><GmapID>0x80ea42b5a5a15f7b:0x7f3860b5b60e2749</GmapID>< Pics>

<Text>My favorite post office. If you actually had to deal with the people that go into this office to complain on a regular basis you would probably want to quit.   These workers have nothing to gain by pissing you off.  I have nothing to say but good things about them.  Like any large company there will always be some that are not the perfect employee.  Most "lazy people" always seem to have plenty of time to post negative comments.  Few take the time to post compliments when they receive good or exemplary service.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80ea42b5a5a15f7b:0x7f3860b5b60e2749</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love the personal, handwritten notes that I get on some of the packing lists that come with my online orders, especially the ones that are shipped from the Sacramento area. That unexpected human touch from an online order goes a long way! Thank you 💛< /text>

Ms. Sarah showed EXCELLENT customer service from the time I called the store. She was extremely helpful and held my hand the entire time until I was satisfied with my purchase. She was able to also provide suggestions as I'm also new to the boards. Thank you Ms. Sarah for your help and very professional demeanor. You are AWESOME! You've made forever customers from my household. Oh.... and my son LOVES HIS BOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That speaks a lot of your products.<//Text>< pictures>

Yo!!! I hope Sully is reading this. God bless his heart and soul. He is such a great employee, very nice, super chill and also kind hearted. Me and my sister went in there to do some shopping and Sully was helping me out. When I went up to pay for my stuff he rang me up. I quickly noticed I was a few dollars short. As I soon I was going to tell him just take out the stickers he said I got you bro. He paid the rest with his card but i felt kinda bad. That literally made my day. ill soon repay when I go back there (I'll make sure I'll bring the right amount this time Lol) May God bless your heart and soul and to everyone else working there. Keep it up Zumiez!!!<//Review>

I love this place. They have good taste in  music but it's just a little bit to loud. The employees were very helpful & super nice. No matter how many times we made them go back and forth doin the same things again & again. They all have great poker faces. Lol It's not a bad place either to fix all of our broken skateboard parts & issues. They have a decent selection of parts. I am definitely coming back & will recommend this place to friends & others.< /Text>

The only thing that was a bummer was this zumiezs didn't have any trucks to build our own long board. Other than that I had an awesome time shopping for my son at this zumiezs location. Awesome work Destiny and Luca.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Asked several people in the store if they had a hoodie I found on line that said was in store. All of them did not even attempt to look, said they didnt know then burried theyre heads back in the boxes they were unloading. More excited about stocking the store then helping a customer.
Never have been the type to shop online, I enjoy the experiance of retail shopping untill today. They told me to go to Tully's.
Give 1 star for stocking shelves in disarray<//Text>< Pics>

< review>
The manager, Zelda if that's her real name, needs serious professional help. I merely came in to check in on a pick up in store order 6.5 hours after placing it (site specifically says orders are ready in about an hour) and was completely scolded and talked down to for coming into the store. She told me "if I would read the email...," which is BS because she didn't even know the order was there or how to deal with it. I would have never got my stuff if I didn't come in to check. She proceeded to tell me to "look around I'm not a $300/day store," when half the employees are doing nothing. It's retail, these stores won't exist in a few years. What a joke.</review>

Dope Zumiez location in Arden Fair. They have a ton of stuff but as a result it gets really crowded in this store, especially when it's busy. Worth popping in though.</Review>

Got my ears pierced, and they had a young lady pierce them for me. I had trusted she's done this before but I guess she was a newbie. It hurt more than I thought it would. Had an older lady who was definitely more experience finish it off. Not coming back here though.</Review>

Great tatt service. They had a clean routine of everyone that came in and out, due to COVID.
My artist Albert, was clean with tools, super chill. I felt comfortable for my first time here.<//Text>

I am proud to have a well organized business in my neighborhood/community. They follow strict protocol to ensure everyone stays safe in these trying times.There pricing is on point. Makes me want to get more tats and piercings just because I felt like I was hanging with the homies. Every employee I encountered had a smile on their face. Keep up the excellent work.<//text>

<text>I went to get my septum pierced. The place was clean and the check in staff were friendly and helpful. The piercer was alright. I definitely wouldn’t recommend getting your first piercing here. Everything was rushed and no one could hear anyone over the music, so I’d say get pierced here if you know the drill and want a quick procedure.

She was clean and my piercing looks good but I had no idea what she was doing or when she was doing it so I can’t imagine the first timer’s panic when the piercer sticks her fingers and tools in your nose roughly without warning or explanation. She asked if I knew how to take care of it, which I did because I researched, but honestly I doubt she would’ve taken the time to explain had I said no.

Place is good for its value but please don’t get your first piercing done here. I don’t even know what metal she pierced my septum with. Guess I just have to hope she read my allergy note on my forms and she fit me with a titanium one.< /text><Resp>None</Resp><name>chuu's wife</name><time>1614925303243<//time><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

Bad shop, un'honest staff. Very Unfair. Won't let you examine jewelry
.so makes it hard to buy the right one .won't give money for jewelry here . Employees are not educated in the products they are selling.
Poor customers service and communication.
I came here for years.  Now just disappointed.  Good make business with you. Good luck . Not coming back.

<Review>I love Brown Pride Tattoo. Two years ago, I got my nose pierced for the first time at the Slauson Swap Meet and my nose ended up with keloid on it. Went to the ER and they told me to wait six months before getting another so my friend suggested Brown and I didn’t have any problems with them. I got both of my nose piercings from them. They’re friendly and they’re professional. I’m about to schedule a tattoo with them because I trust them and their prices are reasonable.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

< Review>
Got a dermal piercing. Location was nice with nice outdoor patio. However, the lady piercer was not friendly and very to the point. Didn't explain the process or anything for that matter. It was very rushed. I didn't even get to ask her any questions. I don't recommend this place for first time piercings, If you want an in and out and don't care to talk, then this is your place.</Review>

Although I did not get it, only because of time, they explained the process to me which calmed me A LOT. I have a sprained ankle and one of the gentleman even helped me to a seat. We made an appointment and I look forward to it without reservation.</text>< pics>

<review>paid 90 for an outline and a finger tattoo. Again very small tattoos! Asked to be identical to the one on my wrist and artist just went with what he thought i wanted. Now that i see it it just looks like a crowded stitching. Cant even tell what it is unless you look closely.<//review>< Date>

I went to go get my upper lobe, helix and industrial and the one who pierced my ear was supper nice. She pierced my ears very fast with no problem and the other staff were nice too. This place is very clean and I got all my earrings for about $60! Would definitely recommend to come here and I would definitely go back! 😇<//review>

My wife and i show up to the shop and let the guy in the front know the WE would like to make appointments for tattoos. He looked a little confused and asked us if WE would like piercings or tattoos and WE said tattoos. So he told US WE would have to make appointments and WE said yes. So he told us to to sign in, use sanitizer and take a sit. 10 minutes later a skinny guy with glasses and a beard came over and said the tattoo artist would like to see you and started walking towards the building,so we followed. As we approached the door he looked back and said only her and i said "so i need to take a seat and wait?". He kept walking in and said nothing. So i waited for my wife for about 30 minutes when she walked out with a receipt and she said my appointment is may 5 and i replied so is he ready to see me next and she said he said nothing to me about you. So i asked the short hair guy standing at the entrance to the waiting area (the same guy WE talked to in the beginning) and he said "Oh you want to make an appointment for a piercing or a tattoo?". So i said "I had said that WE, my wife and I are here to make appointments for tattoos." He replied to me that WE would have to sign in,use sanitizer, and take a seat. So, We would have to REPEAT the 45 minute plus process that we just went through, when your company would have gotten 2 customers at once. With having uneducated people handling your customers in such a matter could mean loss of revenue for your employees. Im just one customer today, but who knows how many before me and how many more to come. Also my wife said after this tattoo session is over she is never going back. She also said that if she didn't have to pay $100 to secure her appointment date that she wouldn't even go back but she doesn't want to lose out on $100. Just remember your company is not the only company that does tattoos. So if you want to be the best then you got to hite the best. This is the last time you'll hear from me.</review>

<Review>MICAH!  We love you!

Best friend and I turned 40 this year and part of the celebration was a visit to Black & Blue to spend an amazing evening with Micah!  Loved the work she did, would definitely like to see her again for more work!

Oh and not only is she an amazing artist... we had a blast!  Very personable and fun!  Thanks again!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I honestly regret going there. I went to get my belly pierced, after leaving I noticed how the lady pierced the hole cricket. She was not paying attention on how to line it up for the center of my belly. Please make sure that the piercing is aligned correctly before leaving. She did it so rushed and there was no people waiting for her.< /Review>

I’ve gotten my nose pierced here before and I’ve had such a great experience! The staff are friendly and overall they just get the job done. This time I came for my nose to be repierced and for an industrial and the women who was attending me used such a small bar my ear is literally scrunched up. Other than that this place is amazing I recommend asking for the guy to give you your piercings.</Text>

He took my art work, discussed it with me, cleaned it up, fixed the spacing and resized it.  The shop was nice and clean and Chris followed stringent infection control guidelines. I am very pleased with the final tattoo.  Very clean fine line work and nice color.  I would definitely recommend this shop.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I went to get my piercing switched out here and the lady was so forceful with my nose piercing that it started bleeding on the spot. It was 5 months old and I had never a problem with it.  The lady didn't warn me or anything and barely spoke like 10 words to me. My nose piercing got a blood bruise after this. I was so upset. Would not recommend at all.My sister warned they hire anyone and give poor training, but I wanted to give them a chance. I had to let my piercing close and properly heal after this. Horrible experience</review>

First of all we waited 45minutes to an hour  to talk to the tattoo artist while they kept attending other people that came after us and to end up they where trying to charge me $100 for a little heart design $100 they where really trying to rip me off other tattoo places charge me $55 and the tattoo artist said oh because that’s hard to do like really ? That’s unprofessional never coming here</text>

The staff is super friendly and very professional. True artists! Me and my partner went in to get custom owl tattoos and had a beautiful result. The artist line work is impeccable!  It's been two weeks and I get compliments everywhere I go.  I'm definitely returning and would recommend to my closest friends and family.</Text>

Don't waste your time.  They had an appointment set for 3 months and never even drew the tattoo. 2 hours before the appointment they sent what appeared to be a google image and when we said that wasn't even what we asked for we were told we would have to reschedule. Can't reschedule because we are moving.  They Told us we can't have our deposit back either and blamed the whole situation on us. The artist was Gabriel and the manager was the one who said we can't have a deposit . Spend your money elsewhere< /text>

<text>I've had great experiences here from tattoos with Bibi to piercings. Only thing that I wish was different, was for the piercers to explain the after care of a piercing once they're done instead of sending off the client. (:< /text>< Rating>

This shop is so beautiful and sparkling clean. The vibe is so positive and everyone clearly cares about each other and the clients.  I feel so lucky to have worked with Idexa and absolutely LOVE my tattoo. My husband worked with Sid at the same time on a completely different concept and also had a wonderful experience.  Can't recommend this studio enough.< /review>

< Review>
I was a drive by 4 yrs ago today and they took me in pronto.  It was clean and they were very professional. The guy that did my tat made sure b4 he proceeded that I liked the end result prior to making it permanent.  However, I was a bit buzzed and only noticed sides of themy head rather than the back side.  In a nutshell days after I noticed that 9ne side was higher than the other, and he had shaved my head to high up from where I initially had shaved it. I do get alot of compliments but when I look at it I see flaws but we live n learn. Overall I go again but sober next time and it does need adjustment n darkened some more.<//Review>

My first time in this place was really good the people here are really friendly & cool. I came with a friend that wanted to get tattoo he wanted a Chinese symbol the guy showed him a great sketch of what he wanted. So we got started & the guy was really patient because my friends hand kept on twitching. But he made it all the way through & the results from the tattoo was really good. It came out perfect! Then I decided to get my ear pierced since I was already there. I got my cartilage done here they did a good job my ear heeled well! 👌 No problems & clean place!<//text>

Some people say it's intimidating but everyone was pretty chill and helpful while I was there. Brian did my tattoo rework. He wasn't heavy handed at all and does really good free hand art. Definitely plan to go back. Bring cash to avoid atm fees.<//Text>

The prices are cheap but you get what you pay for, environment is fast, clean, and unprofessional. The guy who did my piercing didn't explain anything just went ahead and punctured me slipped the jewelry in and sent me off. He didn't give me no after care advice.< /Text>

Great... Totally recommend... Do nice tattoos and good piercings.... Piercings anywhere for only $10 and tattoos are pretty low too. It's awsome. If getting a piercing go with Raul... 😀😘</text>

Don't waste yo time trying to make a appointment here, this tattoo shop has a lot of tattoo artist that don't even care about how your tattoo comes out. The ink is wack like the artists in there. SAVE YO MONEY FOR A BETTER PLACE BECAUSE YO TATTOOS ARE PERMANENT!!<//Text>

I love this place I've only been there once I got my lip pierced the Medusa piercing it was quick fast it didn't hurt much and it only cost $15 some places charge about 20 to $40 for that same piercing The Establishment it's very clean the people are very nice smells good all that nice music plan I will recommend this shop to anybody< /text>

They give you a quote on the tattoo/s you want, but once you go to the tattoo artist they raise the price on what was already settled...Make up your mind!!!< /review>

Worse costumer service ever. the first time was excellent but this second time I'm here is the worse experience ! I waited almost 3 HR
Finally is my turn and the artist reject me because he said was too much detail he dough he's work he was not capable to suggest first. Hes an artist he should be able to suggest before rejecting. Is not this. Picture I brought was he's art .< /Review>

<Review>I got my dermal piercing today! Quick,  efficient & clean . Oh I can't forget HONEST. I came here last week as a lookie-loo. Trynna check out prices. The guy gave me price decent. But he told me make sure you want the dermal because it looks cute now but many people complain later about it getting hooked on things. I think that's pretty honest. HE COULD HAVE JUST DID THE PIERCEING AND TOOK MY MONEY. If you are looking to get a tat or piercing check BROWN PROUD OUT. They get the job done! Thanks for great service.<//Review>< pictures>

Worst experience ever the first driver was nice but the cab he pick me up had his rear shocks gone the ride felt like the rear axel was going to fall off the they send the another cab to the wrong spot and i had to call lift cause they sent. Another cab out to me and he didn't call me to about 9pm so if i didn't catch a lift i would be waiting for 3 hrs dont call this cab<//Review>

What's the point of booking when the taxi never shows up?? I booked way in advance using their app and it was over 15 minutes when it said there were delays in my area and they can cancelled my reservation!! I'd like to give them zeros but there is no setting for it .< /Text>

<Review>I was picked up at mercy hospital after waiting an hour a half . I'm wheelchair bound. Left leg amputee. 1st the guy didn't know how to break down my wheelchair to fit in the back. When we get to my residence, he doesn't know combination to open gate. I tell him * 7000 he keeps entering # 7000 . Then refuses to push me around to residence gate. Which is kinda far. They get top $$ yet there service sucks. Luckily mercy paid for it I will never use them personally<//Review>< Pics>

I would give this a zero but in order for me to make a comment here I had to press one star. It was my first time calling this company and I had a question that was very simple wondering if they serviced another area and the person was extremely rude to me and hung up the phone. I called back and I explained that I am a customer and that he should learn customer service and talk to somebody better than that I proceeded to answer my question once he came down off his high horse and he still answered me rudely And hung up the phone. This just happened a few minutes ago today on  Sunday, August 28, 2018. I Would not do business with a company who acts like this. I am one to give compliments and high praises to people and companies all the time because there’s not enough people that give good positive feedback. I will though give negative feedback when it is needed in which this is!!<//review>

I have google tracking on my phone. My cab driver doubled the distance to my destination like I’m idiot. No tip for this guy. Cab drivers need to be reminded that they can be tracked. I won’t use yellow cab in Sacramento ever again.< /review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>something is not right with the business practices of this taxi company. I used them twice on April 17, 2019.
The cab picked me up at an auto repair shop and took me home. Upon arrival the driver told me the credit card reader was not working so I had to pay cash. A couple of hours later I called for a cab to take me back to the auto shop. Upon arrival the driver told me the same thing for the cab he was driving. The credit card reader is not working. My bill was $17 and all I had was a $20. The driver told me he didn’t have any change. I was forced to give the driver a $3 tip. Something is deceptive with this cab company.BEWARE.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Very fast, efficient service! Request Moradi (cab #: 259). He got us home safely but I lost my phone in his car. He was gracious enough to take time out of his routes to call and return it to me where I was staying the next evening and refused to take a reward. He is a genuinely kind person and incredible human being. I found my regular cab driver in Sacramento! Thank you!< /Text>

Didn’t even have to use the service. Was already turned off when cab 272 pulled into the Safeway parking lot and proceeded to dump all his trash directly into the parking lot. Just left a bad impression. It would’ve been pretty easy to use a trash can 20 feet away...</Text>

Don't accept my cab request If you won't dispatch it.  I might not like it, but no biggie.  You said 45 min then left me stranded.  Lyft anyone.  😤</Text>

This Taxi Cab Company is a joke what a rip off.  I was using them every day for a week.   I was having them pick me up at the same spot and drop me off at the same spot.  I kid you not only two of the 5 times were they the same price and the only reason those day's they were the same is because I had received the same driver LOL what a F****** JOKE !   Honestly I actually build Websites and get businesses ranked on Google ,  Yahoo, and Bing and I do Google Places and I tell you what this business does not deserve to be letter "A" on Google.   There are way better businesses then this that deserve to be on top of Google.comb< /text>

They deserve an "F" in the BBB!!!! they will take you the long way around just to make more money from you for a short trip! they will curse you out if you argue with them and not let you out of the cab if you tell them to stop!!! I was afraid I was being kid napped(young female alone in a taxi) when a taxi went almost 10 miles out of the way!!!! when it was only a 4 mile trip, $12, he took the long way around and it was $23+ I told him no way!!!! I kept asking to be let out, to stop the car, but he insisted he'd get me there.

then a couple months later I tried again, and got verbal accosted on a short trip to the grocery store. it was a $6 trip, I had a $100 and a $5, so I gave him the five and went inside to make change, he even tried to get me to give him the $100!!!! while I made change, I told the dude not a chance...
so I came back within a couple minutes, and gave him what I owed him upon exiting the cab. he then started to curse me, and call me all sorts of dormitory names used to diminish women and make them subservient!!!

I have taken many taxi's in my adult life!!! all over the world!!! and this had to be bottom line the worst company, with the worst drivers in the entire world!!!!!

do not get in their car!!! they will victimize you, try to extort more money out of you by calling you names if you don't tip them, even after they called you names they will still try to extort money from you!!!

This should be CRIMINAL!!!!<//review>

Took us out to the bar. No problem. Super friendly.  On the return from the bar we were told they would not come back out to pick us up. After they made sure we had their info for the return trip. Wow. Could have told us when you dropped us off. Bad customer service. Found another taxi to take us back.< /Text>

I had a great experience when we arrived at the Sacramento Amtrak station.  It's under construction and I was not sure where the taxis were.  The driver came to the baggage area and asked if anyone needed a taxi.  I said we did, and he waited until our luggage came and he helped us out with it.  I knew the area, and told him where my son lived and suggested a route.  He wanted to go a different street, but that was as good as my route.  We got there and he carried the luggage up to the house for us.  The fare was about $14 and I gave him a $20 and told him to keep the rest.  If you are worried about the driver going a long way around to raise the fare, you might Google the route, so you know.</text>

<Text>Most of the drivers that drive for Yellow Cab are rude. I ride through Paratransit service so they have a contract with Paratransit and they have to follow Paratransit rules which they do not. I expect door-to-door service because that is part of Paratransit policy. The yellow cab drivers do not give door-to-door service nor do they open your door for you which is a common courtesy. I would never voluntarily call for a Yellow Cab ever!</Text><date>1513955734974</date><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<review>As in the words of Chris Tucker's character on Friday, I will NE-VAH, E-va, EV-A, E-VA, E-VA, -E-VA, EEE-VAA try to use this cab company again!!!

FIRST,  their dispatcher has a sh*tty attitude! I called and I believe one of the first things they ask you is what is the number you want them to call you back at and before I can even start with my area code, the lady gives me a sigh and repeats "phone number" all impatient like! Say what? She didn't even give me a second to get the "4" out! RUDE! She also did this again for my name! Listen lady, if you expect the person on the other end to be a darn psychic and know what info you want from them before you ask, you are in the wrong profession - period!! SECOND, they left my friend and I hanging with no call to say that their drivers are all busy, are running behind (VERY BEHIND) and no driver ever showed up! What kind of business is this? I don't know about all of these other yelpers that are getting drivers, but I've tried to use them once before and no driver ever showed up then either! I'll stick to my smaller independent cab drivers from now on. At least they show up at the drop of the call!<//review><time>1486320381188<//time>< pics>

THIS COMPANY IS RIDICULOUS!!! I would not only not give them stars, but would provide the maximum negative stars if allowed!

I am a young professional and I was in town for a residency interview at the UC Davis Medical Center. My hotel was about 4 miles from the place and I made sure to reserve a cab the day before to get me from hotel to the medical center. The interview was at 8 am, and it was only a 10 minute drive, but I still made sure to schedule the cab at 7 am! Wouldn't you know it, 7 am rolls around and NO CAB. I call the company (7:05 am) and the first 4 times I called, either I kept getting hung up on, or the calls kept getting routed to another random company. I finally got on the phone with someone and asked about my reservation and she said to me "I'm sorry, I don't see a reservation". I was literally freaking out!

Rather than argue the situation I asked her to send me another cab right away and I was willing to pay whatever extra amount necessary because I NEED to get to the medical center for my interview. She said she would make sure to send one and it would be there in 10-15 minutes (so approx 7:25 am). I asked if she could CONFIRM that a cab would come, and she said "no, it's up to the driver whether he feels like coming to get you or not". THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. DO NOT RELY ON THIS COMPANY IF YOU NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE ON TIME. Needless to say this second cab also DID NOT show up and I was freaking out because I needed to be at my interview. Luckily I saw a bus stop across from my hotel and through a stroke of fortune that bus happened to go to the medical center so I was still able to get to my interview on time. No thanks to this company!

I REPEAT! DO NOT ORDER OR "RESERVE" A CAB FROM THIS COMPANY IF THERE IS SOMEWHERE YOU NEED TO BE. Try any of these companies: Supershuttle, Uber, Lyft, public transportation. Hell, you can even go on the side of the road and wave a 20 in the air and see who stops. THAT will be more reliable than this company. NEVER AGAIN.</Text>

<Text>We called 2 cabs for 7 people one came on time and the other one was 4 mins late. The group of 7 people were together so they wanted to leave together but the cab driver was so rude and wasnt willing to wait for the guests. He had a very bad attitude, we always use to call yellow cab and the service we got was good but that one person was so rude and said alot of things here infront of alot of guests and left. called back to get another one and i complined about him too but they seem to block us so we cant contact them. I can get other taxi companies to come and give us a better service than yellow crapy cab.<//Text>< Pictures>

Horrible service for both the "operator" and the driver. The lady over the phone was extremely rude and the driver was over an hour late! Never will I ever use this service again!</Text>

Today I went to wash, there’s this laundry machine wasn’t pouring water at all. I told the lady who was in charge and she answered me all mad. I’ve been checking and it wasn’t full of water. The lady is very mean and talked back at me.<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I've been using these laundry for years, everything is going very well, the girls. In charge very well
Only today I call the manayer by name. MARICELA to report a problem with a machine and. The truth was very rude. A despotic attitude. That I did not let myself finish. Of speaking And he hung up on me. The flame. Without any solution it is a shame. Such a good place and that they give a treatment like this asus. Clients 👎🏼

(Original)
Llevo años   Usando estás lavandería todo Iva muy bien  las muchachas. A cargo muy bien
Solo que el día de hoy llame ala manayer  de nombre. MARICELA para reportar un problema con una máquina  y. La verdad fue muy grosera.una actitud déspota. Que no me dejo ni terminar. De ablar   Y me colgó. La llama.  Sin  ninguna  solución es una pena. Tan buen lugar  y que den un trato  así asus. Clientes 👎🏼<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The owner should place ads for the machines that do not work because one puts coins and does not work and I went to look for the lady who is responsible for cleaning and was at the talk I had to interrupt to be able to tell him that the machine does not work and only accompanied me to tell me to change the machine, I went and asked him if he did not want to return my coins and said that they do not leave money for them to return

(Original)
El dueño debería poner anuncios de las máquinas q no sirven xq uno pone monedas y no funcionan y fui a buscar la señora que se encarga de la limpieza y estaba en la platica tuve q interrumpir para poder decirle q no trabaja la máquina y solo me acompañó para decirme que la cambiara de máquina fui y le pregunté que si no me iva regresar mis monedas y dijo q no les dejan dinero para q devuelvan</Text>

<review>I called Elite Carpet Care because they have excellent online reviews. They are justified. Miguel is extremely professional; when we first spoke on the phone it was clear he has a great deal of experience and gave me thorough answers to all my questions. He called to alert me about the team's ETA on my date of service, they were there on schedule, and they cleaned/treated my carpet within in the time frame that was quoted. It looks like new! I will definitely use Elite again and any time I need carpet or upholstery cleaning in the future.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1595465936608</Date><gmapID>0x808fc900e22d627d:0x508a8263c89f8cf3</gmapID>< UserId.>

They got the funky smell out and most of the stains. I say most because you have to be reasonable. All in all, I'd say they did a really good job.</review>< Pics>

Very good service and very professional!  My carpets look outstanding. I typically cLean  my own carpet and it looks good when I first do it but the well traveled areas come back looking still soiled.  Miguel explained about how soap residue remained after I did it with my small machine.   All areas of my carpet look the same and very clean now.  I’m definitely going to use Elite services once a year at least so they always look this good.  I highly recommend!< /text>

<text>Very happy with the service. Our stairs was looking pathetic and they cleaned it really well. Carpet cleaning was also good but I noticed that some spots the carpet was bulging in places it did not before the cleaning. Will see how it settles back but after a day it still looks the same. Overall cleaning part was good.< /text>< Pictures>

They were so fast and responsive (and affordable)! We needed our carpets cleaned quickly after finding out our move out sheet on our lease required proof of professional cleaning. They were able to do it within a day! They got the carpets so clean. And the gentlemen who came was very friendly and professional. I’ll definitely be recommending them in the future.< /text>

I contacted the Elite Carpet Care to clean my house carpet. I set up an appointment for 10 am, & they arrived on time. They performed a deep cleaning for an affordable price in my five bedrooms house, considering the fact that other companies charge an expensive rate for such service. I was very pleased & satisfied with the excellent customer service provided, & the outstanding results in the carpet cleaning. It looks as great as a brand new carpet. I highly recommend the Elite Carpet Care to the public, friends, & family to have their home carpet cleaned.</review>

<review>I used these guys through Groupon.   They showed up on time however they immediately upsell you for a deep cleaning.  I only had two spots that needed any extra effort but I did it anyway.  The only thing extra for the ‘deep cleaning’ was they sprayed something on the carpet before they do the standard cleaning.  The spots were back within two weeks.  What a sham this is!!!   So so disappointed.  I will never use this service again!!!   Ridiculous!   Horrible!!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fc900e22d627d:0x508a8263c89f8cf3< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Don't believe if they say they can do $300+ worth cleaning for Groupon price. They will do Groupon price worth service for Groupon price. If you want meaningful cleaning done you need to pay extra.< /text>

I had purchased a discount certificate and was asked to upgrade to a deep cleaning for an additional $100. Although it no longer fit our budget, I have to say that it was the best cleaning our carpets had received over the years using other carpet cleaning companies. I will definitely use Elite Carpet Care for future cleanings.< /review>

The amount of carpet we have in our office is maybe 350 square feet. We sent them away and I personally called the manager and he was not willing to work with us and wanted to charge us a higher rate also.

I have Elite come out about every 6 months and my carpets look new every time. My carpet was more soiled than usual this visit due to the rain and my beagle bringing in muddy toys, but when they left, all the stains were gone. See you in 6 months!< /review>

First time coming in today. I really appreciated the customer service that a gentleman by the name of Spencer was able to help me out, while I was there. Highly recommend this place. The music is great, the place is clean & feels so comfortable to be there. Thanks again Cyber City Esports Center | Northridge.< /text>

<review>Took my nephew for his birthday, was able to park close-by. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is pretty awesome. Neon lights, new computers, clean, and well organized. The guy at the counter was super helpful - especially for me having two young kids with me who needed lots of help and had lots of questions. Computers didn't really have that many issues and ran fast. Would def. recommend and go again.</review><Name>Aydin Hartt<//Name>< gmapID>

The prices are a bit high, though I do understand because of bills. If you love PC gaming and don't have access to a good rig, I would strongly suggest this place to get your fix.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c29a969588f05d:0xc95e4d5060d7f5eb</Gmap_id></record>

Tried this place out tonight and I gotta say, I had a great time. The atmosphere was awesome. Cool LEDs on the ceiling, multiple flat screens streaming League of Legends and CS:GO, incredibly fast gaming rigs, etc, etc. I hope this company continues to be successful. I will 100% be a repeat customer.< /review>

This center allows you to play with the most expensive and the best of PC gear, with also great monitors and computers, and the service! You pay for the food and they will make it and bring it to you while you play, They have a large variety of the most popular games like CS:GO, PUBG, LOL,  WOW and more. I had the best time here!</Review>

Used to be a good spot but it's standards have plummeted. Too loud to have a decent gaming experience and the employees don't seem to care. Most of the equipment has gone bad too,  2/3 headphones don't work right.</Review>

{'time': 1530039828468, 'text': "Hi TIGRANandARTshow, thank you for your review. We would like to earn your better review by asking you to return and let us know what would make it a better experience for you at Cyber City.  We have lowered the volume of the overall radio on a nightly basis.  We apologize for that.  Please do not hesitate to ask the employee on shift to lower down the radio volume if it is still too loud on any of your visits.  We have since replaced any malfunctioning or broken headsets with brand new SteelSeries Arctis 5's as we try our best to give a great gaming experience with higher-end video cards, BenQ monitors, mechanical-blue switch keyboards, SteelSeries headsets, ZOWIE mouses, and ZOWIE mousepads. Thank you again and we hope we are able to earn a better review from you on a future visit."}< /response>

They have food and drinks to sell also there is a 711 across the street if your craving a Red Bull to give you a few more hours of gaming.
$12 first timer few which includes 3 hours of game play and your personal login info.

<Review>@ i have been unimpressed by this location, the others I would give 10 stars if i could, but this location is so much worse. There is a manager who watched the cameras from home/ remotely that will call in to the store and have you removed if you resemble me,  apparently.

Over two full years ago,  I was asked to leave and banned from this location after spending thousands of dollars here. Reason being: because somebody else was doing something In their restrooms (still i dont know what exactly, but they indicated it involved a drug) and I used the restroom after that person apparently. It could have been anyone that they let come in and use the restrooms during that morning as it was about noon. I was aaked to leave and banned without getting to say my side and I had to wait outside in hundred-and-nine degree heat waiting for my ride to come with no charge on my phone ( was not expecting this quick ejection ) anyways my ride never came. I almost died of dehydration. I was lucky enough to get a couple water cups from the restaurant next door but after 6 hours of using their landline trying to get picked up by anyone's number I could memorize , I spent my cash on hand on a taxi cab ride home for $50. Needless to say I felt shafted. Anyways, recently my friend who works there said a guy and his girlfriend went in there and were accused of being ME! I guess they were new customers who bought starter packs of hours @ $12 each (this is mandatory "membership fee" for new Customers and includes 3 hours). However they up and left after someone in the phone accused them of being ME!! What a joke, so after not going to this place to 2 years, they are still discriminating and leading the witch hunt against me. Wow...< /Review>< rating>

The service here is amazing as well; they treat you like family and gives you a homey feel. There's no other place in San Diego that serves authentic and fresh Mexican food and seafood like Costa Azul Mariscos. I recommend this place to anyone who comes around Imperial Beach!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The shrimp were nice size and the cilantro, onions, pepino...all tasted crisp and fresh.  I will be back to try other items from the menu.  The fresh fried tortilla chips were warm and delicious...and their salsa is 8 out of 10 for flavor, with just the perfect amount of spice.  Hope to be working in the area again soon.< /Text>< pictures>

I live in Pacific Beach. I have gone to Fish Shop on Garnet (a highly rated seafood restaurant) since they opened and was a regular at Point Loma seafood prior.
I started here with the fish and shrimp ceviche and was NOT disappointed...sorry, it was so friggin good, I ate half before thinking to take a pic...but honestly, it tasted much better than it looked.
I don't know what I had actually because I asked the lady at the register (literally, probably the sweetest person i've ever ordered food from) to choose for me, since she knows what's freshest and BEST! (although she said everything is fresh)
My daughter had a carne asada burrito...(i JUST asked her how she liked it and from her bedroom she said "I LOVED IT!")
I came with 5 friends that were all very happy with their food as well.
I highly recommend you check out Costa Azul Mariscos...I'll be back next time i'm down South👍<//Review>

Ordered a Carne asada burrito. It was Small enough for 3 bites. As soon as I took my third bite there was a hair in it. Went back to see if they were wearing hair nets thinking maybe it could possibly be mine. They weren't. Do not eat here. Not clean.< /review>

< Review>
Ordered a large coctail of shrimp and octopus. Price was $17.88 which is what a high end restaurant sells their large coctails for. When picked up my order my she gave me  my order in a disposable coke cup. Pretty much what they give you to fill up on fountain drinks. The coctail when opened had a bunch of ketchup on top. Way to sweet, could not finish it. Also when asked lady for some water, she said they had bottled water, and could not give water in a cup. I called her out on that, and told her I believe all food restaurant are obligated to have water available to clients for free. At that she gave me water in a cup. Same type of cup, my coctail came in. Would not eat here again...< /Review>

1 of the worst Mexican shops that I have eaten at. I ordered 2 Carne Asada burritos. Both were almost as small as Tinas frozen burritos(of which taste better). Then I requested extra salsa because  they only put 2 in the bag. The lady looked at me like I was out of mind or something. Then she was hesitant to even give me 1 extra. Then I get to my destination. I give 1 to my co-worker. I proceeded to eat the other. Man! It had no flavor, it was so bland. My co-worker agreed. I won't waste my time or money going back there. "LUNAS" taco shop is better on Palm Ave in I.B.</text>

carne asada fries  were absolutely disgusting...fries tasted weird, either retooled some old fries or under cooked with no flavor.  The Carne asada was Itty bitty pieces of meat, smothered in sour cream and guacamole with absolutely no Balance. Only good thing going was the salsa on the side and the horchata....16.00 in the trash and my family is still hungry....do not WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, OR APPETITE you will be disgusted.</text>

<Text>DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! This place is not worth the prices they charge, the rice is bland, beans are dry and the "avocado" looks like pea soup! If you ever are unlucky enough to eat there do not, I repeat, DO NOT eat the SUPREME QUESADILLA. What this place considers SUPREME is lettuce tomato and runny avocado NO MEAT?! I support local mom and pop mariscos but GOOD GOD MAN. You will be a lot better off down the road and Santanas.< /Text>< username>

Went there for the buy one get one special.  The fries were $9. But you have to buy 2 drinks for $3 a piece. Super empty, food is ok. Honestly I'm not going back. Nothing special. Spend your money elsewhere.<//Review>

< review>
The food was ok. Culichi was way too spicy. I love spicy food but way, way too much jalapenos in this version. It was almost inedible Costa Azul shrimp was outstanding. Expensive, but definitely a winner. The soup was terrible. It tasted like watery ketchup. Salsa was ok, but a lot of cilantro. Overall, we had a good dinner. It was expensive but ok. Would recommend for something different, but not for everyone.</review>

<Review>BY far one of BEST attractions in DTLA! The HIGHLIGHT of the weekend and the BEST way to end  and start a new week! You Cannot lose going here! The market is EXTREMELY well-managed by Adam and Robert! Super clean and secure,security guards all over! There's a hand washing station and hand sanitizer in almost every corner. There is a limit to how many people can be on the premises, which is closely monitored by SUPER FRIENDLY staff. EVERYONE IS HAPPY THERE! You can use your EBT card there, as a matter of fact it is ENCOURAGED, and they even MATCH your money dollar for dollar! Robert wants EVERYONE to enjoy the experience so he came up with the program! Gotta LOVE THE GUY!!
Oh HAPPY DAYS ARE SUNDAYS AT THE DTLA FARMER'S MARKET! You can find FRUITS, VEGETABLES, BREADS, CHEESES, KOREAN BBQ AND KIMCHE, YOGURT, AMAZING POPCORN,FRESH JUICES, PLANTS (The LA Garden) , CBD PRODUCTS, ALL ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS FOR YOUR HOME AND BODY (Francesco Palmiri),and just SO MUCH MORE!
I have been going to this market for 6 years and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AND THE PEOPLE WHO SELL AND RUN IT! HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</Review><user>106446641095894521188</user>< user_name>

< review>
This farmer's market is a great place! I'm so happy because the vibe here is so cool and the people here in this place was so amazing. The booths are full of fresh goods, and everything else is at a good price. The experience was so amazing, and I'm sure that I will come back here again. Thanks a lot!< /review>

Great farmers market! get my lettuce, carrots, onions, leaks, cilantro, tomatoes, etc etc etc.
Plus the booth that sells homemade pita bread and five different flavors of hummus  is awesome, another booth has the best home-made tamales, beef, chicken, pork, chile and cheese, Muy Rico! They remind me of my moms. Great plants, soap, & incense. Home made baked goods. There's something for everyone at the Historic Downtown Farmers Market. Sundays 9am-3pm.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>My husband and I hadn't thought about putting a farmer's market on our vacation list, but we saw the sign and went in. Wow! Italian food, Mexican food, French food, fresh pasta, chicken waffles, local fruits, vegetables, and a seafood truck with a long line next to it. Take time while you're on Saturday. If you skip breakfast first, you can eat your way through the market!</text>< pics>

<text>I visit this place every time hen visiting Los Angeles due to the great outdoor shopping experience. I find a great collection of vegetables and meat items. The tram that runs through the middle of the market makes it a novel and great place to visit with family and friends or even alone.

<Review>I love going to the market on Sundays. Upon arrival, there is a person stationed at the entrance to help control traffic flow. That person informs you about wearing a face mask, keeping your distance, and exiting at the other end.  Often, I find I have to wait about 2 minutes before I can enter because only a certain number of people can be in the open space market at one time. The person at the other end communicates how many people exited the market which determines how many people can enter. I am happy the same vendors return each week and are set up in the same spot generally making my shopping experience easier. I like being spoken to by the vendors as I move among the crowd. I am becoming a regular. I purchase yogurt, berries, and green leaf items. I create my own fruit smoothies with the items. Everything is fresh because I've noticed these items cannot stay in my refrigerator for a week. I have to use the items and purchase again the next week. My goal is to improve my health through exercise and better eating habits. Items I need to try are the honey and a few of the flat breads. I noticed a vendor or two offered aroma therapy. So I have to try those as well.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

It is a nice place to visit on a Sunday morning. There is also entertainment and some activities. Sadly for us, we were staying here in just a few days and could not buy any of the great-looking produce although prices looked reasonable.<//Text>< Pics>

There is a great variety of fresh veggies, bread, honey, dates, and more here on Sundays.

The dates are particularly wonderful. They will explain the difference between male and female dates, the textures, and the flavors of the date varieties.

Highly recommended.</review>

Docked a star mostly because 1) parking garage gets pricey after the initial two hours and 2) the lines at some of the stalls are crazy.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

We spent over an hour wandering through the market. The fresh food was fantastic and the pies are just delicious! There were plenty of tasting stations we tried the steak and that was just amazing. Our trolley was over flowing by the time we got to the checkout. Check out staff were super nice, they even have ice bags for a dollar each if you have a long drive, which we did so that was perfect. Anyone passing through should take the time to visit.<//Review>

This area is super cute.  There are lots of small vendors and booths set up.  There's a large variety of restaurants, coffee bar, tea places, as well as shops to buy food and other nic nacs.  If I wasn't a tourist, I would probably do some shopping here.  I'm glad we stopped by for a visit.  We had a coffee and sat outside near the water.</Text>

<rating>4<//rating><review>The food selection is one of the main reasons why people come here. Everyone comes to this location because it is like a giant food court and everyone will find someone they will like to eat. From ramen, Italian, seafood, Thai, tacos, and even ceviche! And along with these great selection of food, there is random places that serves alcohol along with their meal, and there is even bars. It seems like they are mostly beer, so if your looking for a cocktail then I think you might be out of luck. So after the meal, there is also dessert. They have ice cream, coffee, donut shop, juice bar, and even a fruit stand...if your into that lol.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c64af0a48a15:0xea52bfc41153ab53</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Really like this place. Its not quite Trader Joes, its more like Mollie stones and Whole foods.

Yummy veggies, tho I'd beware of mold on some and expiration date on packed product... It's a new place so I was disappointed about that.< /text>< UserId.>

Cool environment and vendors. I got some good veggies and delicious hummus. It was nice to see signs that dogs aren't allowed in the area because of the fresh food but of course people completely ignored them and no one enforced it. Dogs shouldn't be allowed everywhere. It can be pretty unsanitary.</Text>

What can I say, one of LAs main attractions. Every tourist should go there. And try not to buy stuff from the T-shirt shops, if you want produce or a beautiful French meal or French groceries etc. definitely go but if you’re looking for a bumper stickers please don’t go. We don’t need more of those stores at the market.<//text>

We live nearby and it is hard to get fresh produce in this area. This opens every sunday and it is an oasis for our healthy groceries. There are many bites to grab. My favorite is tacos from the vendor in the middle. I forgot the name but you will see a long line up. All the prices are really reasonable too. 5 dollars for 3 bundles of fresh veggies and 2 dollars for a taco!</Review>

Great small little farmer's market with the perfect amount of things.
There are 3 or so vendors selling vegetables and fruits. The remainder of the booths are food vendors. I can pretty much get my groceries for the week at the vendors.

Just wish there were more fresh food vendors sometimes.<//Review>

Love the yogurt, organic honey and oolong tea here. It's also awesome to check out the handmade jewelry and the live street performances. If you use ebt, you get an additional $10 to spend!< /Text>

<date>1501216339855<//date><Rating>4<//Rating><review>I give my recommend to this Farmers Market over Brentwood' s or Santa Monica's any day of the week ...but I think it's only open on Sunday.  THE REASON I do so is because of the once a week chance to blend the classes at their divide downtown bet putting a big ol farmers market right over where the normal grime and crime tends to begin to dwell,trickling down the food chain from there in to Slid row.  Normally people who don't partake into the ball of dope will have a sense of "I need to gtfo" the moment they step in but not when there is a farmers market...blend the classes and sort am out down the hill tomorrow. ;-)<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

외국인에게는 서점 이라기 보다는 인스타그램용 사진 남기기에 더할 나위 없이 좋은 곳입니다. 서점 치고는 예쁘고 아기자기하고 올드한 느낌도 있어서 한 번 일부러라도 가볼만 합니다.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbb4Z9QlKXqWemWrOg_nKfIr7sh93iTOr3Iv7W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLHJaTBzy26Q5yptLWrOwVuWoEPFjBrYqORvRC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6GXtBtSZHmN0jpQmuLklcKVZZf8_sJAm8sFbR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5IZG451MjFYB3AuImm-Ui1myYXnFlPH_0h1ZI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPURna71K-GYMOZj9tYWU3rpkmQAl5AJVcCDP5C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDK2u3HvPA8---a7qIP7ZDBlb8u6xQfub1dieN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c64af0a48a15:0xea52bfc41153ab53< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great service! I had an emergency last night and they came out and worked on it until midnight to make sure it was resolved. I had a leak on my water heater hose that was spraying water everywhere. I went to turn it off and  the shutoff valve which was old and corroded was jammed and wouldn't turn. Then the main shutoff was also corroded and would only shutoff partially. Carlos came out and was able to fix everything. Very professional, did amazing work and overall nice guy</Text>

<Review>We contacted Ninja to diagnose the source of a potential leak in our unit down to the garage of our building.

Ninja -- and specifically our plumber, Ahmad -- were amazing.  He came out for multiple visits on time and always followed up as he said he would.  What we really appreciated he is would take the time to explain what he was doing before, during and after the job.  This helped us feel at ease and helped me learn a lot.

Additionally, he was extremely responsive in all our communications, including in the evening when I had questions about which toilet to buy at Home Depot :).

Ahmad's become our go to plumber in the LA area.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1610743881703, 'text': 'Thank you Rashad for your feed back.

On a Sunday when my toilet broke, Ninja Plumber was there within 90 min and Jonathan not only fixed the toilet, but replaced the water shut off valve that was broke!! Pretty amazed to get it all fixed so fast and work done so well, on a WEEKEND.  Highly recommend them.< /text>

Henry came before the time given, which is always a plus. He then assessed the piping and went straight to work. Very professional in demeanor and in his uniform. You usually get the sweaty plumber with the worn out shirt,  it this dude was ready for work. On top of doing the job right, he gave me a discount from the original estimate. Thanks Ninja Plumber for being speedy and professional. I will definitely use you again and will recommend you to all.

Thanks, Armando</text>

The WORST experience!
Marlyn (the girl who will answer the phone) was kind but not helpful. I spoke to her multiple times explained to her the problem with the shower faucet and that we did have to turn the water off to the house in order to stop the water leak, she said it would be 2 days before they could get someone out. No problem with that we said okay. Dejon (our technician) was 4 hours late. With no phone call we had to call them to find this out. He told us that rocks were in the pipes and that it would be no charge. So we were pleasantly surprised gave him a $20 tip for all of the trouble. 10 minutes after he left we went to go check the leak, and it was still there. We called him immediately back and no answer so we had to call the company. After finally getting ahold of him again. He said that he would come back tomorrow. After waiting all day the next day I finally called the company at 4 PM for them to tell me that he would be there at 6 PM to 8 PM. He never showed up. No phone call or text. We are still without water and now have been for going on four days. My recommendation would be to pass this company up and just call another and save yourself some time.< /review>

We work tirelessly to hire, train and support our technicians so that they can be at their best.

We are quick to correct and retrain when we see the signs. Some appreciate their second chance and some don't. This is part of the process to finding the best candidates to represent us.\nAgain, I apologize that you had this experience and if you decide to give us an opportunity in the future I assure that your experience will demonstrate how and why our reputation is as strong as it is.\nHave a blessed day and Happy New Year!"}<//Response>

I had an issue with the hot water line possibly clogged in the kitchen sink. When I called, I spoke with Alexis who managed to get someone out to me that same day. The plumber not only arrived time but took care of the issue in a timely manner. Overall experience, both the operator and plumber were professional and very helpful.</text>

Very professional business I called them because my bathroom was clogged, Marlén was very attentive and very kindly booked me an appointment to be seen as fast as possible. I immediately got my bathroom fixed when the plumber arrived overall very happy with the service especially how fast and whole process was. Will definitely recommend if your looking for some good service.</review>

<text>Highly recommend based on the great service provided by Geovanni and Alexis. They are great ambassadors of a company that truly understands and values the importance of customer 1st.

Long story short, you know you're in good hands when they genuinely apologize without excuse and ask the very key question; 'what can we do to make this right for you?'. Turns out, what they came back to make right, at no charge, was likely another contractor's fault that came after Ninja did the work.

These people are top-notch! Thank you Alexis & Geovanni!< /text>< pics>

I just wanted to comment on how such an amazing job Ninja plumbing did at my house. My toilet and bathtub were clogged up and the water wouldn’t drain. I gave them a call and there customer service was phenomenal. When showing up to my house they finished the job in a timely manner. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking to fix any plumber issues. I will definitely call them back for any of my next plumbing conflicts!!!!< /Text>

<Review>I had an AMAZING experience with Ninja Plumber! The overall quality of labor and communication with this company is what really set things for me. I will never use another company again. I called them because my shower and toilet kept overflowing occasionally and I was not able to fix the issue myself, they came the same day I called them, assessed the issue, and gave me a fair quote. I had them do the work right then and there. They provide honest work and fair pricing and I haven’t had an issue since then, if I do.. I’ll definitely be calling them!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I cannot say enough wonderful things about the experiences I have had with Ninja Plumbers, especially Kevin.  We have had a few issues over the past year and they have all been pretty big jobs and Kevin has helped us on all of them.  He is very responsive, punctual and extremely trustworthy.  I don't know the first thing about plumbing but he has always taken his time to explain everything so thoroughly so that I really understand the scope of the job and what he is going to be doing. I would absolutely recommend Ninja Plumbers to anyone who has a plumber and I would always suggest they ask for Kevin!</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I cannot say enough wonderful things about the experiences I have had with Ninja Plumbers, especially Kevin.  We have had a few issues over the past year and they have all been pretty big jobs and Kevin has helped us on all of them.  He is very responsive, punctual and extremely trustworthy.  I don't know the first thing about plumbing but he has always taken his time to explain everything so thoroughly so that I really understand the scope of the job and what he is going to be doing. I would absolutely recommend Ninja Plumbers to anyone who has a plumber and I would always suggest they ask for Kevin!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>I'm here visiting my parents and noticed they have plumbing problem, i really don't trust plumberd cuz from my personal experience they charge a lot of money for their service but I got this company from a friend. I can't say anything yet about the actual service since it hasn't occurred. What I can rate is my experience with scheduling the service. The lady I spoke to was Alexis and she was super friendly and informative. I like to ask a lot of questions just to make sure my parents aren't getting screwed but she answered a lot and made me feel assured. She was nice and wasn't pushy or forceful with anything. I truly hope the plumbers share and show the same energy and enthusiasm to my parents that I experienced with her.<//review>< date>

My shower was backed up and so was my washing machine. These guys came out at exactly the time they promised and found that the problem was deeper into the line. They had to do a hydrojet, which they performed same day and got me flowing. I’m very happy with their level of service and Josh did an excellent job.<//Review>

We had a pipe back up overnight and needed a quick response the day. Called Ninja Plumber and they were quick to come out. Justin was the name of our serviceman and he was awesome! Straight forward about what the problem was and he took the time to show and explain how to fix it. Would highly recommend this company and if you do call, ask for Justin to come out!< /Review>

Found my go to Plumber(s).

Giovanni showed up in the time window.  He initially came to fix the kitchen drain which part of the pipes had started to disintegrate.  He gave me the options to fix only the parts that were damaged or the redo the entire time.  I opted to do the entire drain since this is a rental and all the piping is very old and I'd rather just get it all done now.  I also showed him an issue with the guest bathroom bath and shower valve.  He ended up having to replace the entire valve after trying the stems first.  I was very appreciative that he finished both jobs even though only one was planned.  He stayed late on a Saturday night to finish it all.  This is important because this is a rental property that is at least an hour drive away so I was really happy to get it finished in one day.  Giovanni was friendly, professional, transparent, and on time.  A friend recommend Ninja Plumber to me and they did not disappoint.</text>

<review>My experience was great with these guys. My bursted pipe in the yard got dug up and fixed in under a day. They got to my house, found the problem, gave me a fair price and got to work. Geo van I kept me in the loop at every step and made sure I was at ease the entire time. If you need a plumber call Ninja and ask for Geovanni.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c299e285226a17:0xf3d3394986126bef<//gmap_id></record>

He came back the next morning to complete the job and was super fast. He also checked for other leaks around our house when he was done, which was awesome. He answered any questions I had as well as let me know my sink was draining slowly and fixed that also! 10 out of 10 and would definitely recommend them to anybody I know.

I used Ninja Plumber once in 2017 and again today in 2019. First time was to work on my sink and this time was to replace my water pressure regulator. Both experiences were excellent. Justin was our Ninja today. He arrived when he said, explained the work and the cost, did the work cleanly, and then left. He was prompt and professional. I had my wife with me and Justin didn't trigger her creep-radar, which is nice. In fact, she was home alone for the Ninja visit in 2017. While we can't remember that plumber's name, he, too, gave quality service without being condescending or setting off any alarms. It's a good thing to find pros like this.<//review>

Highly recommended. Just moved into new townhouse, had new washer/dryer delivered only to discover leaking laundry water valve. Found them online, they were able to come out right away. Though they didn't have the right part on them, they went and got it and came back a half hour later. Thanks, Justin (and sorry, forgot the name of the other plumber with him).<//review>

They took care of our rental property in  Van Nuys while we were gone and kept us informed the whole ime. We were out of the country and they made us feel as if we were present the entire time. They sent us videos, pictures and even did a video chat with us.the drain line was repaired in 2 days and we saw every second of it. Most importantly our tenants were very happy with how they worked around their schedule and their concerns having a newborn. Thank you to Askari and Matt for all your hard work.<//Text>

We used Ninja for sewer and plumbing work on a deal of ours in Sylmar. Both Ray and Justin were professional, on time, and thorough. They found hidden problems that would have become big problems had they not pointed them out.  When we had a scheduling problem with another trade, Ninja worked with our schedule and went out of their way to help us when we were in a pinch.</review>

< Review>
Ninja Plumber was a life saver. We had numerous plumbing problems: leaky faucet, a faucet that wouldn't spray properly, a third faucet that wouldn't drain/close properly, and a troublesome toilet mount. Ninja's guru of plumbing--Matthew--fixed them all flawlessly. One special note of how great he was:

The spray issue mentioned above required multiple visits to our house--not because Matthew didn't know how to fix it, but because the faucet manufacturer kept sending us the wrong parts. Even with all his trips to our house, Matt was unfailingly polite, upbeat, and relentlessly focused on fixing the problem.

We've used five or six plumbers in the past, but I'm delighted that we found Ninja Plumber and Matt. I'll never call another plumbing place again, and urge you to do the same.</Review>

<Review>9/31/19 passed by my street 2 times before parking right in front of my house for at least 20 minutes. When nobody called!! Plus my side of the street is the side you can't park. It sure is weird. The driver's name started with a J. The license plate was 57103T2 California.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>Sorry, I get that you probably run a good business but our toilet we had 2 visits and paid $300+ to fix original problem still there AND actually created a new one. Instead of being honest and saying, "this might not fix the problem" or even admit they made a new issue, they just looked for excuses to charge money to change parts and if we ask to come back and fix problem created by your new parts good luck they play the "we know nothing" card. Basically paid money for someone to have a confidence inducing conversation they knew what they were doing, paid them, and no help to fix unless we made another appt. Wouldn't even come just to LOOK for free the mistake THEY created. Never again, but cool name. Ironic in this case. Ninja must mean you disappear when help is actually needed.< /Review><date>1499529381253< /date><user_name>Ryan Emslie<//user_name><rating>1<//rating>< Pics>

They don't have enough technicians working yet still promise time slots they can't keep. Apt made from 9, they said he is running late, called again after 10, they said he'll be there at 11, after which they said the latest at 1pm, went ahead and cancelled at 2pm. Their customer service representative was not helpful and rude. Avoid them.<//Review>

Everything was cooked well just not amazing in taste department. Service was friendly and decor was lovely and that's it.<//text>< time>

The staff were friendly and attentive, our waiter was great. The food was just excellent. We had the guacamole and chip dip and then the flank steak and enchilada. The food was an amazing combination of flavours. The Mango cocktails and the casual vibe of the restraunt made for a great birthday celebration! The cherry on top was the heavenly mango cake they brought out with a sparkler. 10/10 will definitely be going back.<//text>

started with the Asi Sabe Mexico, translated to ‘That’s Mexico’ on the check, a Watermelon and Cucumber Cocktail made with Blanco Taquilla, Lime, and a Tajin rim served in a short glass. It was light and refreshing on the first sip but very cucumber heavy and continued to linger well after. It was too much cucumber and I did not finish the drink. I returned 3/4ths of the drink when I ordered something else. It was $11 and was included on the bill. *(I know businesses are struggling with staffing and financing so I did not say anything- I was happy to know it added to the bill and tip the server received)*

I switched to a Paloma. It was served in a pint glass with a salt rim. $10. Delicious!

We started with a small Guacamole for $9.99. It was made with nice chunks of avocado. It lacked a bit of lime but was very fresh. It was served with a side of Salsa and fresh Tortilla Chips. The Salsa was very good and if you only want the Chips and Salsa they are $3.75. We got a refill of chips and we’re not charged for them.

For dinner I had Chile Relleno en Crema de Epazote y Camarón. $18.25. A poblano pepper stuffed with crab and shrimp. I substituted the white rice for the Cilantro Rice and I think that was my mistake. The Cilantro Rice was very good but more wet like a Risotto. The dish was topped with a very tasty cream sauce but might have been over powered or lost within the rice.

One of my companions ordered the Carne de Puerco en Salsa Verde. $18.25. They said the Pork was cooked perfectly and the Salsa Verde had a strong lime flavor. They also substituted the white rice for the Cilantro rice. We both agreed the dish might have been better as designed on the menu with the white rice. They also had the Asi Sabe Mexico and agreed it had a heavy cucumber flavor. They did however finished their drink.

The last of our party ordered the Tacos Poblanos de Arrachera. $16.95. Steak Tacos in blue corn tortillas, with sliced and grilled poblano peppers.  They said they were good but wished the flank steak had been salted further. They ordered a Passion Fruit Frozen Margarita with a salt rim and said it was delicious! (Price unknown as we split the check)

This restaurant gets a lot of praise and maybe My expectations were set my too high because everything on the menu was a traditional Mexico dish. Overall 7 out of 10.</text>

Awesome spot. My cousin took me with his wife and we had a great time. Swung back by again today for happy hour and was great. Very nice clean interior with a very mellow vibe. Great for a quick drink or an extended stay seemed to be a good mix. Loved how clean the bathrooms were.<//Text>

Their drinks are good, and the plant based menu blew my socks off. Ask the server for it when you get there, it was phenomenal. And the ambiance of the place was really cool.< /text>

I had reserved a table for 8 at 8 pm in celebration of Mother's day and celebrating my cousin that is visiting from out of state. We were running a few minutes late (traveled from Napa to Sac) and called to notify the restaurant, to our surprise they did not have us confirmed even though I had a confirmation email from Yelp! It was the most embarrassing and frustrating experience ever. Our mothers day was ruined! The person that took our call almost made me feel as if I should have known that Yelp! wasn't a source to reserve a table for them. This is not the first time that we get less than good service at this establishment, I do not intend in ever returning to this place.<//review>

Very poor, unimaginative food. This was not a Michelin guide quality restuarant in any way. Food had very little flavor and we found it very boring to eat. The carnita plate consisted of 2 tortillas and a pile of barely seasoned pork. The tacos had dry meats, again with no seasonings. There was barely, if any sauce, and it was desperately needed. The "bites" were tasteless and boring. We were extremely disappointed! Why would Michelin include them in their guide?<//Text>

THANK YOU ERNESTO!!!  The experience you gave us was unmeasurable!!  We usually don’t eat Vegan or vegetarian dishes(we are trying to mix it up hopefully more than once a week)but you gave us the confidence that we would not be disappointed.  I appreciate your experience and relationship with MAYAHUEL..  You presented a level of ownership to this establishment that I don’t see too frequently at the high end restaurants in Sacramento..
I would also like to thank ALL OF THE STAFF on the appearance of how well it functions based on how consistent the timing of service was throughout our dining experience.(not only for our table but all of the tables in our area)
THANK YOU MAYAHUEL!!< /Review>

<text>We had reservations at 7pm on Friday. Even tho we we arrived early, we were sat at our table by 645. The food was delicious and the drinks were on point. Service was ok but they were clearly short handed and struggling to keep up. All and all a good time. Definitely returning.< /text><username>Irie Pearl</username><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>It's a nice place.. Food is great.. I had then enchiladas Verdes 2x.

Big downside is all the margaritas as $10-12 but are very small. Served in a lowball glass, packed with ice. Maybe 7oz of actual liquid.<//review><time>1616522691587</time><Name>Ryan Kohout< /Name>< pictures>

This place is absolutely amazing. The staff was very nice and made our lunch selection. Visiting out of town can be hard to find good food and this was superb. More like gourmet Mexican food!!! When I’m back in the Sac, I will visit you guys again!<//Review>

<Review>Delicious food, great hospitality and reasonably priced!
My husband and I come here regularly because I have never, ever been disappointed in any of the above!
I'd give them 10 stars if I could!
It's exactly how eating out should be! Where you are dining out but feel at home!!!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAszL-OSrczwHxeYclMg7WJEa_hTyWlCXso5FQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNggoZYpnQ-T9g0l7KrhLVbBOnHr1I_aquAl8VI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlQgXcGtRR2CMQSlrFVJnUV4rP2Me1LcZGJABk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqD9eyFx-HlXNTE5smHSGIeeVGquDBzJOdqR7p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809ad0d7d68211f3:0x5d4a27675de40311< /gmap_id></record>

I often take my friends to this place with my highest recommendations. I visit this restaurant often. This recommendation is always successful. The dishes they serve are fantastic and the stuff is generous and cooperative. Whenever we eat in this place we pass a delightful evening.  I recommend this place with pleasure.<//Text>

I love this place! Can't say enough good things about Mayahuel and their friendly service and staff. Ernesto, the owner is always great to talk to and is really passionate about his guest having a great experience. If your visiting Sac this is definitely a place you need to try!!< /text>

<text>Food is just okay for the price.  Drinks taste good but arent very strong. I got the chicken mole enchiladas and they were lukewarm. My husband ordered the rib eye with chorizo and liked it. The chips, salsa, & guacamole was good.< /text>< pics>

The art and Tequila relics surround this downtown gem from the entrance to literally the bathrooms walls. The food is an experience of its own. Chef coco and the kitchen staff really have something special going on behind the scenes as everything on the menu is 5 star. The owner is a friend of Sacramento and a very hospitable restaurateur.< /text>< username>

< Review>
We showed up here looking for a Mexican restaurant. We were shuttled to the patio which was cold and damp. Then we looked at the "cusine" described in the menu which was $16.00 tacos.

I am so tired of businesses bowing to the state rules. The state is going  to drive you out of business so why not just treat the customers visiting you like friends and give them a great comfortable dining experience.

We walked out and found a Mexican restaurant with food not cuisine.

We didn't stay so I can't legitimately so it was all bad so if you want cuisine next to a heat lamp go for it.</Review>

Ordered molé and enchiladas (de chicken).  Mole was good, not great, right amount of chicken, enchiladas was thin on the chicken and taste was good also.  Guacamole was very good, but 10$ was a little steep.  White rice was under done, mex rice was good.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Amazing restaurant with a variety of tequila to choose from. The staff is highly knowledgeable in tequila and treats guest to a nice experience. My salad was so delicious. I went there during a business trip, and saw there was an event for that evening in Crest theater, so I decided to stop by.  I am so happy I was able to stop by.<//Text><rating>5< /rating><time>1596336087590< /time>< Pics>

<date>1541788316063<//date><rating>3< /rating><review>Loved the ambience of Mayahuel, great location right across the street from the capital. Parking garage right next door. I went with a large group and they pulled tables together to accommodate us. Our server was attentive and the food was quick.  The food in my opinion was just okay. It was good but it wasn't fabulous. I ordered the pozole salad which looked small but was very filling and had large chunks of chicken, a bit tangy though. The chips and salsa are to die for! I will likely go back to hang at the bar but I would be okay passing on the food. Everyone at our table did enjoy the meal, no complaints but no compliments either.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I saw some articles online said this restaurant qualified for Michelin standard.  Turned out was in area, and decided to give a try.
The restaurant decorated so nicely, and people there were so friendly.
Appertizer was perfect, plated nicely and tasted really good, and kind of fun.
Carnitas was really flavored, but maybe b/c it's in Bay area, people tended to be healthy, so they took all pork fat/skin off, so there's some flavor missed there.
I guess they didn't not expect people ordered Pastel de Mango, so the top glazed layer still frozen, but I still liked the cake a lot.
The reason I gave 3 stars b/c alough their service were friendly, but very sloppy.  When Carnitas came, I had to find somebody to bring me the tortillas.  And then I found there was no fork.  Especially at this level restaurants, tap water NOT supposed to be served.
The dishes are really good， but towards to Michelin star there's a long way to go.<//Review>

I went here for my birthday dinner and it was great. The food and drinks were good and the service was nice. They brought out a little piece of cake with a sparkler on it which was sweet. I didn't give 5 stars because there were little issues like my mom getting the wrong salad. But overall I'd definitely recommend this place and I will go back.<//review>

Vegan pistachio mole was bomb!
The plantain mole was too sweet for a savory dish. potato taquitos for my grandson were super yummy and the service was pretty great! But.. I only gave it 3 stars because I expected more elegance and class from this place. It was not suitable for a Christian family celebrating a courthouse wedding. I went from reviews ranting how great this place was and was happy to hear they had good vegan selections. However, the  bar was the main attraction. Two bars to be exact! Reminded me of clubs in Mexico I used to attend as a teenager before I grew up.  For the high prices of those entrees I just cannot say I would go again. Either go all out and keep your bars and basketball game full blast or tone it down and give it a classy touch but it's just not working as is.<//review>

We were a group of four girls I felt like we were discriminated against and the waiters focused on getting us out of there by rushing us out. One of them said to us "are you finished yet?" with such a horrible attitude. The waiters were very consistent with rushing us out every 10-15 minutes but not anyone else around us, some people had been there since we arrived and they were never rushed or did we see waiters going to their table so much. Being Hispanic and getting treated this way in a "mexican restaurant" is the worst feeling.</Text>

We had a server named Ernesto who was extremely knowledgeable and took the time to help us make our choices. He was prompt with everything and very nice. Probably the best waiter I've ever had, and definitely the biggest tip I've ever given someone. I absolutely would eat here again. Food was delicious and so were the drinks!</Text>

Service was excellent, very attentive and friendly staff. The chicken mole was good, but I didn't care for the Spanish rice. Great location, but a little hard to find using gps. I would go back.</Review>

On the pricier side but the drinks and tacos were worth it. We decided to check this place on a Saturday night but found they required reservations for regular restaurant seating, however we could sit down at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and the selection for alcohol and tacos was extremely good. Will visit this location again but will make sure to do a reservation. The oaxacan old fashion was freaked awesome!<//review>

This place has a dedicated vegan menu. Very uncommon for a place that doesn't have health in the name anywhere. Patio service was great and it was a great place to feel free from covid while simultaneously seeing all the best practices being followed. Check their website menu before you go for easy ordering.< /review>

I had been here a while ago and it was fantastic. This review is for the takeout experience we just had. Not good. They forgot to include tortillas in my meal. The lump of carnitas was uninteresting and dry. It just was not a good meal. The charro beans were still tasty, so they got 2 stars instead of 1. If you are not going to eat there, do not bother with takeout.<//text>

Great tequila selection, let your imagination run wild.  Mole is excellent and the Spanish rice is too die for.  The Chile relleno was stuffed full of shrimp, crab & cheese.< /review>

<review>Nice space and good service. Definitely a cut above the regular run of Mexican restaurants. The signature chile soup was amazing.

We came in working a reservation on a Saturday night at about 5:30. After a lot of waiting for the one hostess to get a chaotic to-go order, I was nervous about our choice. It seemed very disorganized. Once the to-go order was finally taken care of, we were seated right away. My friend, two teenagers and I all loved our meals. The guacamole before the meals was AMAZING. The food is very unique (not cookie cutter Mexican restaurant at all- very authentic) and fresh. We will absolutely be back.< /text>

Excellent service and delicious food. Very cool atmosphere and beautiful location. The patio has a very cool feel with lights and trees outside. Margarita was well made, but can not say enough good things about the service!!! I also asked for a spicier salsa and it did bit disappoint 😁<//Text>

<Text>I had come here a little while ago for a business trip and the food was okay. I saw the reviews on Google that this would be the best most authentic Mexican food he would find in all of Sacramento but I was actually very disappointed, the rice did not have a lot of flavor, and the beans tasted like they had a metallic or metal flavor like they were in a can or tin for a long time. I shared it with someone else just to double-check that I was wasn't imagining the flavor but they also had confirmed that it had a metal taste

the waiter was very kind in the beginning but then his personality changed as soon as there was an error in the bill, the manager came and also had a little attitude

if you are Hispanic and looking for authentic Mexican food I don't recommend this location. over priced for what it is, and the food is okay not that great,
Roberto's taco shop has more flavor<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmGHmYVJsxQsBr8qscK6t4emH347RsfOO8Fuhm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Love this place with passion. Very classy, and well oriented Mexican restaurant. Usually when you see such a high end place, food might not be as good as one of those smaller places but in here, you won’t see that: food and ambiance are great.

I’ve tried many dishes, all of them are exquisite. Their alcohol options are also off the charts.

My favorite: ceviche and Don Julio 70 Paloma.<//Review>

Excellent Mexican food of a different variety. Not your typical menu. Great selection, I've eaten here at least three times and have enjoyed all three different meals. I'm downtown for seminars at the Sheraton so it's a short walk and no wait at about 11:30, my usual lunch break, but about 15-20 min later it's hopping. I've lunched with a vegan co-worker and she's enjoyed it as well.<//text>

<Review>Two things impressed me about Mayahuel:

1. Fastest service I have ever seen at a sit-down restaurant. Everyone's dish was ready in about five minutes.
2. The ice cream themed after Mexican hot chocolate was the best ice cream dish I have ever enjoyed. A seemingly bottomless well of creamy, chocolate goodness.<//Review>< userid>

<name>Edward Donaghy<//name><Text>This place continues to delight me. Just tried one of their brunch specialties, Mole Quilaquilas with 2 eggs, and it was amazing, with such complex, multi-layered flavors. It was impressive.

Their house margarita is perfect, and this is a beautiful upscale tequila/mezcal bar and Mexican restaurant.

Unique menu, you gotta try it. They charge $3 for chips & salsa, which irks me, but they're so good it's worth it.

Same ownership as the cool La Cosecha in Cesar Chavez Park.</Text>< UserId.>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>First time here. Customer service was really superb. We came for the vegan menu and were not disappointed. A lot of thought and creativity went in to the dishes here. My only suggestion would be to include more fresh vegetables and perhaps go a little lighter on the sauces, which were delicious but very rich. Also the cocktails were perfect. I'm not usually a tequila drinker, but my drink was just delicious, not overly sweet. We'll definitely be back.</Text>< pictures>

Mayahuel always delivers, whether it's a deliciously mixed margarita or the perfection of their poblano mole. Add in a beautiful setting, evocative of a Mezcal experience, and I never leave disappointed. Truly a shining star of Sacramento.<//Text>

Bocaditos de Mexico Plate Taster platter from different cuisines of Mexico was great, Crema de Chile Poblano was superb! Grilled fish tacos were also pretty good. Enjococadas Michoacanas enchiladas were bland and boring, basically tortilla stuffed with cottage cheese topped with sour cream - go for something else.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809ad0d7d68211f3:0x5d4a27675de40311<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We were in town for a concert and ate dinner beforehand at Mayahuel. Our experience was excellent. They have a large cocktail menu, and our waiter was extremely helpful in assisting us to choose a few very tasty tequila drinks. Our dinner came in record time and everything tasted amazing! The decor is colorful and the vibe is lively. There were so many delicious sounding menu choices, we would love to come back and try a few more!< /Review>

<name>AY Y< /name><review>One of the best Mexican cuisines in Sacramento. There are two bars in this location. Our bartender was very friendly he came off as professional and laid back. Food was brought to us on time. The steak tacos are delicious here. The drinks are really good. There is plenty of seating available, but you also have an option to make reservations. I’m sure I will be back here again. I like the neighborhood it’s located in it’s very close to other things you can do to have a good time in the city.</review><resp>None<//resp>< rate>

<review>3 hours in this restaurant just to get 5 people meals and drinks. We went on a Saturday night, yes we assumed they'll be busy but why not have extra waiter's?! We only ordered 4 meals and that alone took more than 45 minutes to come out. Also, you can't ask whoever is dinning if they want more chips and salsa, and not bring them if we clearly said Yes. And we also reminded you guys about it, the last time we asked for more we didn't even bother with the reminder. Before leaving we ordered shots, tell me why it took a solid half an hour to get those shots. 30 Minutes for a shot! Huge Tip, don't get the Bocadillos De Mexico $12 for a joke of a plate. Olive Garden Tour of Italy has more food than this for about the same price. I was so surprised I laughed at my own choice of Food. $160 for Mexican food and it wasn't even meeting all the hype. The Mexican food I cook at home gets better appraised than this.</review></record>

<Text>The best upscale Mexican restaurant in the Sacramento area! The quality of the food and their drinks is amazing and it has not changed since I started coming here for over 3 years now. Their staff is incredible and very attentive to their customers. Its one of my to go places during the summer because of their outdoor seating area under beautiful trees and hanging lights. If this is your first time at Mayahuel, definitely try Tacos Poblano De Arrachera or the Chile Verde as your main dish and Bocaditos de Mexico as an appetizer (perfect for people like me who can’t decide on an appetizer). The Mangoneada  Margarita is a must try, you won’t regret it. Mayahuel definitely stands out from the rest, it has a perfect location with unique decor and great customer service. ¡Simplemente delicioso!<//Text>< gmap_id>

the tacos came in a nice box which was presented plain and basic. the tacos has nice chunks of chicken for sure and served on a blue corn tortilla which was ok. overall won't recommend this dish if your paying like 18 bucks.
.
the salsa verde chicken enchiladas was a blew me over with the taste. the taste was so good and savory. the chicken tasted like cream of chicken I can still rave how good it is. came with some rice and salad on the side if I remember correctly. this is a must try and will get me to come back for. the price is steep for 18 three pieces but hey the flavor was unique and definitely delicious. totally recommend.
.
overall the wait was quick about 10 mins so if your in a hurry I'm sure you won't have a problem here. thanks for reading and if you like my post follow me and give me a like. thanks again! have a bless day!< /Text>< Pics>

I went right here for my auntie's birthday supper a few weeks ago. I'm not going to grumble on the solution we had since it was extremely busy and also guest from my aunt's dinner were coming at various times so it was challenging to get food ASAP. I do remember I got the steak tacos.<//Review>

<Text>Great service, lovely staff. Perfectly mixed, Moscow Mule. The roasted salsa was stellar as was the guacamole which had a few chunks of avocado. The chips were warm, crispy-crunchy and fresh tasting. I ordered the vegan enchiladas topped with mushrooms in a most authentic mole'. The dish was complimented with fluffy, white rice that really just showcased the enchiladas. I'll be back with friends and family.<//Text><UserId.>109571062150790538198<//UserId.>< name>

Had the vegetarian enchiladas with requeson, guacamole, chips, watermelon margarita and cheese taquitos and margarita-lime pudding dessert and all were excellent! Great service too. Highly recommend.</review>< Time>

The environment was active and full of energy, chock full of pieces of art showing great pride in the restaurants heritage.

Nice ambiance and vibe! Exceptional dining experience! The service was good. They honored my Groupon and helped me validate parking. The chips and salsa were the best I’ve had in a long time! The Cadillac margarita was delicious with salt - just heavenly! My son ordered bean and cheese burritos from the kids menu. They were perfect “baby burritos” with beans and rice. I had the enchiladas verde. They came out fresh and tasty. I was served ice water without asking and it had cucumber in it.  The Mayhahuel Fresca was delicious - silver tequila grapefruit with mint - so good!!! They boxed my food and bagged it for me. And also brought out a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate drizzle and a dab of whipped cream. I would definitely come back!<//Text>

Good food but that's about it. Waiters were confused about who they were serving. Once served he disappeared. Had to ask for check. Wouldn't recommend.</Text>

<review>I would eat here every day if it were closer, but I love to visit it when in Sacramento. However, there was no soap in the women's restroom when I went Friday for lunch (and I forgot to tell staff on my way out.) I came for dinner Saturday and again, no soap. A female staff immediately filled it when I informed her. Other than that, the food is AMAZING, service is quick and friendly.</review>< pics>

Surprisingly good vegan menu!  The fixed price option for vegan food is a really good value, and perfectly adequate for 2 people.  Their cocktails are delicious, and the food is quite tasty.  Overall, a good place to eat, especially if you are vegan or vegetarian!< /Review>

<Review>Modern fun atmosphere.  Plenty of food on any dinner plate. The Chile Verde w/ pork had a solid flavor could use a little more spiciness personally. The steak tacos are full of meat they don't cheap out on that. Drinks were spot on with arm of alcohol.  Fun date spot.<//Review>< user>

Amazing tequila selection. Food is very tasty. Wait times on food and drink weren't bad at all for a Friday night. I womt say this is the cheapest place but for the selection they have it's worth it. Just be aware its ONLY tequila and beer, no other types of alcohol.</review>

Flank steak was tender and delicious and well-accompanied by rice and very flavorful soupy beans. I enjoyed mixing the three while eating. Ernesto was a great attentive and knowledgeable server. The atmosphere was lively with very interesting murals. I would return.</Review>

<text>Come 8 pm, I oddly checked before driving all the way out there as well as, lo and also behold, they close at 9 pm. In some way, this girl did not understand her own store's hours and scheduled my reservation for when the dining establishment closed. I've also mentioned that I have a GroupOn on a Saturday appointment- once more the person hosting over the phone stated nothing- and we were turned away since the steward read the fine print and also saw it had not been enabled.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809ad0d7d68211f3:0x5d4a27675de40311<//GmapID></record>

Loved it! Went here for our date night. they participate in the Sac Vegan Chef challenge and have an amazing and inspired menu for the occasion. Their regular menu, which includes meat options, is sure to please the non-vegans. Absolutely phenomenal food. Service was impeccable. Highly attentive and anticipated our needs. Definitely looking for easy to going back.</text>

Now that I have been here a few times, they have a very good vegan menu with several options, which I have tried most of. And we tend to do the 5-course prix fixe since it's a better deal. The Chipotle Almond Dip is amazing! This was the first time we had something like this dip, though now we also have had Bitchin' from the store (also yummy).</review>

<Response>None</Response><text>This is the first restaurant I’ve ever had trouble with my reservation. We checked in 5 min prior to our reservation and had to wait for a table, which was no problem. However 20 min later, we still haven’t been seated but they sat two other couples. When aid checked back with the hostess (mind you we’re sitting right in front of her) she said she’s still waiting on a table. But, then the other lady comes up and admits she actually just forgot about us, no apologies or anything.</text>< date>

Drinks order took an awfully long time to arrive even though it was not busy. We were not provided a tequila menu and the margarita selection was lacking even though it is supposedly a tequila museum. The food was bland and overpriced, and we had a pebble in the salsa.< /Text>

I would like to say this restaurant lacks the authentic Mexican flavor, they are an alright restaurant to dine in for Mexican food compared to all the Mexican cuisines I’ve tried.</Text>

I used to run a cooking school and had some amazing chefs come thru and if I still ran it I would invite one of their chefs to teach a class! The food here is so fresh so flavorful and I enjoyed every bite! Coming back again for sure!
Their vegan selection was fantastic also</Text>

After we had all ordered drinks, some of us got our drinks, and some of us didn't. Turns out they were out of an ingredient, and the waiter failed to let us know. Then we ordered our food. Again, most of us got what we ordered, and one of our friends received nothing at all. Again, the waiter just failed to let her know that they were out of what she ordered.
The food that we did get was very good. But the service was lacking. We probably would have ordered something different if we had just known, but the lack of communication made us order nothing.< /Review>< date>

<Text>Delicious drinks and delicious food. The service was great. The place has great ambiance. The watermelon margarita is my favorite. Its very refreshing and not too sweet.

Food was great. But were is the burritos all mexicans love burritos? The seats where comfortable just cheap. The waiters was nice and attentive but the drinks tasted funny. I think they should have more selections of margaritas. But the steaks was the bomb.<//text>

Joke of a place.  Good food and drinks but the service is absolutely ridiculous. You can not order food from the bar menu if you are in the dinning room.  Ask why, and the response is we just can't.  I've been to places where the staff had left the restaurant to pick up something for a guest because they didn't have it.< /Text>

I'm a very disappointment​ customer that just got out from this restaurant​
a ​couple of​ hours ago. I hope that the owner of​ this restaurant sees this review and takes action of this matter. Early this afternoon I have called to make a reservation on a specific table, I had planned​ for my family to go from the bay area all the way to Sacramento on private transportation and when we show up, that specific table was taken. The funny part was that the person that supposedly​ did the reservation told me to be there sharp at 6:30 pm​ and we were​ there at that time. A manager or owner named Ernesto came out to talk to us in order for us to not leave the restaurant because I was super mad, he said that he was going to provide with good service, he also PROMISE me that the mariachi band was going to start singing in our table at 8pm because they sat us on the opposite side​ of the restaurant. So we stayed we finish eating and then our waiter told us that the mariachi was not going to show up, that totally ruined​ my night with my family. It's unbelievable​ that managers can lie on your face. I will never come to this restaurant anymore until they provide me with what they promise me.
Those of you that are planning​ to come from far away and reserved a table think it twice. I hope that I will get a good explanation from the ​administration​ department and hope they will recompensate​ for ruining my night with my family.</Text>

Excellent margaritas and anything with tequila. I'm sure the waters fine too but I've never had it. The green soup is phenomenal and you have to try it. Ask your waiter theyll know what your talking about.<//text>

Food was great, we had three different dishes, chili verde, enchiladas in green sauce, and shrimp tacos.  All were excellent, the rice was particularly tasty and I don't like rice.  Only 4 stars because the place is noisy and the servers and service was slow and a bit pricey for what you get.  Definitely worth a taste though.<//text>

<Text>We had a very good dinner here. All the food we ordered was pretty good. The chips tasted a little funny though...maybe an issue with the oil?
The service was excellent, they were very attentive. The food came out quickly.
Expect to pay for parking. Very limited street parking in a busy location.< /Text><gmap_id>0x809ad0d7d68211f3:0x5d4a27675de40311<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

<review>By far, favorite upscale Mexican food place in Sac!  The guacamole is crazy good. They do charge for chips, but they are also made a la casa!  I gave them a 4 out of 5 because the service can be hit or miss. Great place for margaritas and the food is on point.< /review><username>Keith Hassett</username><Rating>4< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My friend dragged me there for a weekday lunch and I thought boy, this place is probably pretty pricey. It is pricier than average places downtown for lunch, but I will tell you the food was delicious. There were three of us and we each split our plates amongst each other and everything was great. Also, the customer service was exceptional! You have to try their Mexican soups. They let us try to and they were amazing!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Yummy Mexican restaurant within walking distance of the Convention Centern the Sheraton and the Hyatt, among others. The outdoor eating area sits in a tree-lined parkway so you can people watch as you dine. I had the fish tacos and could barely finish them. Salsa, which is an indicator for many, was delicious and well made. Great service also.</review>

<user_id>109214612013362313711</user_id><Review>Limited vegetarian options and the Enchiladas Zapotecs that I had we're okay. The flavour from the mushrooms was a bit overpowering and ended up not eating many of them. My friends quite enjoyed their meat options.

We were in a bit of a hurry and the staff were very helpful and able to seat us quickly at one of the "high tables" jumping another group who, I guess, were waiting for a regular, low table(?). Either way, the high table was totally fine with the only difference seeming to be that it's a higher table which uses stools instead of chairs.

The complementary chips and salsa we're good with both being quickly replenished when they ran low however despite placing our order quickly and the server telling us that he'll get it in to the kitchen right away (as opposed to what? Delaying giving it to the kitchen?), our orders took quite some time to be served. This was no doubt at least partially highlighted for us because, as noted already, we were in a bit of a time squeeze but nonetheless it definitely felt longer than what one typically experiences.

Would I return? As a meat eater, I guess so (again, going off of my friends experiences). As a vegetarian, in a pinch, but not until I had better explored other options in the area.</Review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

Does not list all the ingredients, which is a huge Health concern if you can't have shellfish and all the sudden there's shrimp Toppers on your taquitos. I've been to this place 4 times the only time it was acceptable is when I ordered the entree completely deconstructed. Every single menu item I have ever ordered has come with some additional ingredients or sauce that was not mentioned in the description.< /text>

I ordered the green Chili sauce chicken enchiladas for the third time, they were delicious.  Service was great, make reservations for lunch, a bit high on the price to portion but probably appropriate for downtown.< /Text>

< review>
Sacramento and this short stretch where the blue LRT line has to turn is where this place is located.  In a pedestrian promenade type area where there's a few restaurants and an IMAX theater right by the Hyatt and other nearby hotels is a gem called Mayahuel.  I looks to have several storefronts but there is an outdoor patio and that is where we dined.</review>

Very impressive assortment of items on the menu, but not so many that it was hard to choose. The Enchiladas de Mole was amazing! I could tell the mole was house made with care and maybe even some love. It was bursting with flavor and perfectly complemented the chicken in the enchiladas.

In addition to the regular menu, they also have a vegan menu that's equally full of variety and creativity.

What a wonderful lunchtime experience. The place looked like it would be fun at night as well. I highly recommend stopping in when you're nearby. It's even worth a trip all by itself!<//review>

<text>This was excellent Mexican food and an awesome Margarita.  The restaurant was fresh, clean and friendly.  My only 2 critics:  the restaurant should automatically serve chips/salsa BUT more importantly...homemade tortillas.   Store bought just aren't the same.  Res in adobo is wonderful.<//text>< pics>

<Text>The wait staff was attentive and friendly. I have some food allergies, and our server took the time to find a number of dishes that I could eat, offered to have the kitchen make a couple other accommodations.... Then the food was really good, especially considering the price.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Nice place. Good service. Good food. Walking distance from Convention Center (1 block).  Visited on hot summer day...the a/c worked very well.   Felt cool entire dining experience. Figured for downtown eatery with ambience, prices would be high and portions small. Surprisingly not so. Prices are what to expect in downtown, but portions were adequately filling. Especially the large guacamolelarge...totally worth it (could use a bit more salt though).  Absolutely would go back.</Text>< GmapID>

I was in town on business and had a great experience dining here by myself.  Employees were extremely friendly and service was top notch. The food was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. I will definitely return if back to Sacramento.<//Text>

<Text>Attended a Graduation dinner. The hosts at the entrance were attentive to point me to the room where it was held. Room very spacious, good seating. The waiters were quick to take requests for beverages. Accommodated the little children in attendance with high chairs. The Mexican dishes were served buffet style by two very cordial servers. And the food was well seasoned; plenty of food for a second round. Oh, I was impressed with the cleanliness of the bathroom areas.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

My husband liked his beef dish and I had the ceveche which was okay. It's a tequila place and I thought my margarita was weak and plain tasting. I just didn't think it was all that great. We were on a date and got seated right in between 2 big groups, weird choice for seating...However the art and decor is cool!</text>

I've been here twice and the food was delicious both times. 1st time what my friend had wasn't as great as what I got which was the appetizer with the small little crunchy tacos called taquitos de requeson. But we shared the appetizer chorizo y queso Oaxaca en bolillo tostado and those were great. For my entree I had the steak with a chile verde enchilada and Spanish rice. Let me tell you as someone who's grown up with authentic home made Mexican food their chile verde is one of the best I've ever had! If you have anything with that chile verde it'll be amazing.

This 2nd time around we went with a group of friends and I had the chile verde enchiliadas again great. 2 others had the shrimp ceviche which had a lot of shrimp unlike some other restaurants, this was mainly shrimp with little veggies and it tasted fresh and great with tostadas on the side. Another friend had the dobladitas de chile de poblano which wasn't what she had expected since the menu said blue tortillas filled with cheese it had like one of those along with some other small finger foods on the plate, but she liked it. We all shared the chips and salsa and the salsa was tasty. For dessert me and another friend had the Mazapan with ice cream which btw doesn't crumble like the candy and is hella good. I've never had Mazapan made from scratch, they make their own. 2 other friends had the mango cake which comes with 2 slices of cake. I'm not a big mango fan but this cake was good it had the texture of a yellow cake kinda spongy, topped with a tart mango topping, and the filling was a creamy mango filling. Overall this place is delicious and even had mariachis while we were there. It's a great location for things to do afterwards also.< /text>

< Review>
If this is the best margarita in Sacramento then I feel sorry for Sacramento.

Everything was just average food-wise. The patio was nice with the lights at night and our server was really personable but I can’t imagine ever coming back here on purpose.

Really wanted to like it, but nope.< /Review>

Great tequila/mezcal bar and very good food. The waiters tends to be less than knowledgeable about the bar selection though, so make sure to sit at the bar if you're going specifically for the drinks.</review>

Fancy restaurant. Deffinately not authentic Mexican food. Excellent customer service. Food was not satisfying. I was confused as to what type of food it was. Didnt taste like Mexican food to me. I had steak tacos. Meat was thick and chewy. Yuck. Sorry not my type of restaurant nor food.< /text>

<name>Roberto Leibman< /name><text>Excellent tequila bar, great selection, and they made sangrita for us!
The food was good and well executed, authentic. My only very slight nit it's that in a high end Mexican restaurant I'd like to see more experimentation, maybe a bit more fusion, Sacramento already has good restaurants, such as zocalo, centro, azul, nixtaco, bringing to the states some of the new Mexican cuisine that's available in Mexico City, for instance, would be great.< /text>< time>

< Review>
Save your money!!! Margaritas were full of ice. Food was bland. Ordered enchiladas and got three filled with plain chicken and white rice. Food is overpriced and not worth it. Service is horrible. Waitress barely wanted to interact with us. Maybe it was because she was providing service to two African American women. When we left no one thanked us for coming. Overall horrible experience.</Review>

Worse customer service ever! Rude staff, i was offered a bad table and when i asked for another place to sit with my family, the waitress didn’t even bother try finding one , she just said thats the only one we have for you! How rude and unprofessional! Needless to say we left immediately, I’d rather spend my money where it’s appreciated!</text>

Best margaritas in Sac hands down. Make sure to order it WITHOUT salt. Salt is for margs that are made with inferior tequila. Huge high quality tequila selection here.</Review>

The servers were kind, thoughtful, and the type of people who make you feel at home when you're away from home in Sacramento. Much appreciated how they knew their cuisine and also that they are attentive to each guest's need.</Review>

< Review>
Went here after a Broadway Sacramento matinee.  Our meal was wonderful, unfortunately we got chased down K street by a homeless drug addict immediately afterward who hassled usfor our leftovers and then grabbed them out of our hands.  In the broad daylight.  Downtown is an absolute mess, I wish I could say otherwise.  Great restaurant but the experience ruined it for me for good.  I really want no part of downtown anymore;  I’ve travelled to many of the famous world cities.  Sacramento can’t seem to get it under control.< /Review>

<Text>Bought a groupon for this restauraunt for Valentines day.

Unfortunately I Was unable to use it on Valentines day. Which wasnt a big deal. I just saved it for another day.

I came today and was also turned away at being able to use my groupon because they stated (and i quote) “Can’t use it on Saturdays. It says on the Groupon.”

I thought okay..? so if we’re going by the Groupon then it also does not state Valentines day as being excluded. And yet they neglected the groupon.

Asked to speak to the manager.  To my surprise  the manager personally came and introduced himself, told us he would honor it (given the unfair circumstances).

Thanks!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Just tried their Bloody Mary - sooo good! The food is also top notch. I don't feel they just want to fill your dish,  they want to give you an eating experience to remember. All the dishes I have tried have been very good They have a chile poblano soup that is excellent! Can't wait to return!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Loved the atmosphere! Chuy the bartender was great! He provided excellent customer service, was very informative with suggestions and explanations on the menu and cocktails. He made me a delicious watermelon and vodka drink and my husband a tequila and diserono mixes drink. The food was very flavorful and the presentation was excellent! I would definitely go back!! We ordered the rib eye and chorizo, requeson taquitos and the guacamole bowl.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Live music on Saturdays makes the place alive. I have been here for two birthdays. One was reserved seating and the other was at the bar. The bar experience was much more pleasant and fast service when ordering drinks than the reserved seating.<//text>

<text>My husband and I love this place. We come here just for the vegan menu! Everything on it is soo good but our favorites are the Sikil P'ak (roasted pumpkin seed dip), the spiced lentil soup and the Pistachio mole over portobello mushrooms.The margaritas are great, the wall murals are beautiful and the prices are really reasonable. We will continue to bring our family and friends here.</text><resp>None< /resp></record>

< Review>
We were in town, to see the Phantom of the Opera, at the Community Theatre. We enjoyed appetizers and cocktails. I loved the Latin themed decor, and ambiance.. Food was delish, as were the cocktails, our server was very friendly and checked on us often. Perfect pre-Theatre spot, as it was just around the corner. Parking was free from 5:30-10pm. Will gladly return soon.< /Review>

Stopped in for dinner while here for a convention.  Very good and staff was on point, even got to sample a few of the items before placing order to make sure they were not over spicy for my sensitive palate. Looking forward to go back next year when in town.</Review>

And if weather is not hot U'll be lucky to be seated outdoor. I was lucky that day.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>We were downtown to watch the IMAX movie and found this place. It turns out it is the hottest new Mexican Restaurant in the area and we were not disappointed. The menu is smaller than some places we've been, but the quality of the food, it is unbelievable. Whether you get the genuine Mol'e, Enchilada's Verde or just beans, the flavors are incredible and authentic. Everything is from scratch and made from the finest ingredients. If you are a Tequila drinker, they have the largest variety of world class Tequilas I have seen in Sacramento. Killer Margaritas too. On a scale of 1-10, a true 9.5 (no 10's ever given).<//text><rate>5< /rate>< Pictures>

<Review>I went with my family and ordered dinner for my wife and I.  I also ordered tacos for my kids and the waiter told me to order tacos from the taco bar. So I stood up and as I was about to order them, the waiter told me that he would take them to my table.  When I received the bill the tacos were for $5.00 each and not $3.00.  He said that the tacos were $3.00 at the taco bar and $5.00 at the table.  I said to the waiter why didn't you tell me that before you brought them to my table. He apologized and said that he will not chance the bill. I have been going to eat at Mayahuel with other friends and their families since they open at least once a month and I've been noticing the food portions and specially the service has been gradually diminishing.  This is not only my comment, it is also from three other families that used to go eat there and are not going anymore for the same reasons. Sorry but we are going back to its competition.<//Review>< Pics>

The albondingas soup and pozole were both superlative. We didn't have room to try many more of their dishes, but we would return to do so.<//text>

<username>Michael Murza< /username><review>We were extremely happy to learn that Mayahuel has a dedicated Vegan menu.  When we arrived, we decided to sit at the bar (it was about a 15 minute wait for 2 at 7pm on a Thursday night).  The bartender was extremely friendly and accommodating, and quickly took our drink order. We soon ordered our appetizer, which was the Sikil P'ak, a delicious pumpkin seed dip. I would highly recommend this as a perfectly sized appetizer to get you ready for your meal.

We then got our main dishes.  I got the Pistachio Spicy Mole and she got the Huitlacoche Enchiladas.  While the enchiladas were well constructed and incredibly tasty, the Pistachio Spicy Mole absolutely blew me away.  It was rich with deep flavors and was perfectly paired with the portobello mushrooms; I could not have enough of this dish.

While I want to get the Pistachio Spicy Mole the next time I go, I feel like I would be depriving myself of some of the other vegan items they are offering.  Everything I tried was delicious, and everything else on the menu looked similarly delicious.

As I said, we went for the vegan menu.  After our experience, we will definitely be returning for the vegan menu, which the bartender noted would be rotating relatively frequently, so there will likely always be something new to try.

Sacramento is beginning to have more vegan options, and I think Mayahuel is offering one of the most complete and elevated vegan menus in the city. I can't wait to go back.< /review>< Date>

The place is very nice on the inside and has a nice patio. Service was good. I ordered a bowl of Albóndigas which the description clearly states it is a stew. What I received, though extremely tasty, was soup. It was not a slightly liquidy stew. It was clearly a soup. I mean, I dont need to describe what a soup is and a stew is. It was soup. But again, it was delicious. The chips and salsa were OK.</Text>

I came here with some coworkers for happy hour on a Friday evening. We chose to sit outside since the weather was beautiful. The outdoor seating is what lured us into the restaurant in the first place. The hanging lights, the cozy/chic seating and the music created the perfect ambience. You can not go wrong with the $5 margaritas for happy hour which were absolutely delicious. The guacamole is absolutely amazing and a must. I had the carnitas dinner which was equally delicious and came with pick, guac, beans and my choice of either flour or corn tortillas.  One of my coworkers had the cevice, which was a huge portion, and she finished the whole thing. My other coworker got the tostadas with pulled chicken from the happy hour menu which I also thought was a great portion size. I would highly recommend this spot if you're ever in the area.<//Review>

<Review>I was going to skip doing a review until, I realized that I wasn't being over critical. My suggestion, if you are going to treat customers of Groupon with an assumption than don't participate. Typical, the host couldn't place my order to go because of the fine print in groupon. No biggie, I sat at the bar and politely explained to the bartender my intent of taking a bite and leaving as I really just wanted it to go. Well, my assumption is he didn't think I would tip. Food comes out in 2 minutes, I box it up and leave a tip. Not more than 30 seconds later, the bar back takes the cash off the bar without at least asking if I would like my coke refilled. Bummer, cause the food was amazing.</Review></record>

I hosted a business dinner in the private Coa room and was very pleased with the service and food & beverage. I called many other restaurants in the downtown area and Mayahuel's price and menu options, and private room availability just could not be surpassed. The room is great, the service was perfect and the food and drinks were delicous! I would highly recommend this restaurant as a wonderful place to host a nice dinner for a large group.< /Text>

The food was bland and spicey. The waiter assured me it was not spicey. The meat was bland the rice  was spicey and the beans were gross. It was not pleasnt. Being from sonoma where there are tons of Mexican eateries I thought this would be good. Bad deal.< /Text>

Ok picture yourself in the Capital City of California on a Saturday and you are craving tacos.  Well all the taquerias are closed but this place is open.  They have Modelo Especial and Victoria on Tap.   You have to pay for chips and salsa but the salsa is good.  You order Tacos de Arrachera which come in blue corn tortillas and satisfy your craving.  If you really want to throw it down this is a temple to tequila.....I am sure your liver wont mind.</Text>

<userid>114314286896005592185<//userid><response>None</response><review>We went yesterday to see if there was a place available because we did not make a reservation, immediately the lady at the entrance told us no because we had children. Curiously they have a children's menu and there were other children inside, when we asked him why there were children inside, he said because they are outside and we can't have children in here. Not surprisingly, it is worth mentioning that they have a patio only during a pandemic, where did the children sit before? Very rude, for an overrated meal.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I am very sorry to give you a star, my friends and I went on Monday the 18th to dinner and it is not the first time that we have gone there when the hostess sat us down they brought us water later but the waiter appeared about 15 minutes later other tables that arrived later that we were served instantly we without napkins without chip or sauce The waiter who served us I do not remember his name but he is a tall thin I asked him what kind of fruit he had for the margaritas and what was the best fruit he answered me What did you recommend the cucumber margarita to me 🤦‍♀️ I think he doesn't know how to differentiate between vegetables and fruit, I didn't say anything to him afterwards, we ordered different beers and he didn't have them when he brought the beer we asked for, it was hot, the best thing we did was get up and go I feel bad doing this because I love going there and he told me he was sorry but it was very busy and I only looked at about five tables with customers and there were I think two other waiters stopped by. I just want the manager to see those things that perhaps he does not realize and to deliver better to his waiters so that he knows how to differentiate them in the vegetables and the fruit of the daisies Thank you very much ☺️

siento mucho darles una estrella mis amigos y yo fuimos el lunes 18 a cenar  y no es la primera ves que hemos ido ahí cuándo nos sentó la hostess nos llevaron agua luego luego pero el mesero se apareció como a los 15 minutos otras mesas que llegaron después que nosotros fueron atendidos al instante nosotros sin servilletas sin chip ni salsa El mesero que nos atendió no recuerdo cómo se llama pero es un alto delgado yo le pregunté qué qué clase de fruta tenía para las margaritas y que cuál era la mejor fruta él me respondió qué me recomendaba la margarita de pepino 🤦‍♀️ creo que él no sabe diferenciar lo que es la verdura con la fruta no le dije nada después pedimos diferentes cervezas y no las tenía cuando llevó la cerveza que le pedimos estaba caliente lo mejor que hicimos fue levantarnos y irnos me siento mal hacer esto por qué me encanta ir ahí y él me dijo que lo sentía pero que estaba muy ocupado y yo sólo miré como cinco mesas con clientes y había creo que otros dos  meseros aparte de él solamente quiero que el gerente vea esas cosas que quizás el no se da cuenta y que entregue mejor a sus meseros para que sepa la  diferenciar en la verdura y la fruta de las  margaritas muchas gracias ☺️< /Review>
