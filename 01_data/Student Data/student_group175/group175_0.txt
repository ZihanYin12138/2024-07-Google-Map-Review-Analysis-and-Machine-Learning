Amazing experience with their teeth cleanings. They use this cool technology instead of the old-fashioned methods I’ve had done to me in the past. Super fast and effective treatment. This Fullerton dental office location is so modern! It’s like a beautiful, remodeled hotel. Side note, the bathroom alone is one of the nicest I’ve been in! The dentists and hygienists are very professional yet personable, which I appreciate. The front desk girls are super knowledgeable on insurances and always greet me with a smile when I come in. What more could I want? If you’re looking for a Fullerton dentist or orthodontist, definitely check them out!</Text>

Dr. Austin Burnett, thank you and the staff.  Sure, it was difficult trying to convince my 12 year old daughter to get the IV.  Dr. Burnett,  I truely appreciate your understanding and care from explaining our options and the procedure this morning.  You guys are the best.
I am really grateful that we chose OC Smile.  Our experience has been beyond outstanding.   If a 12 year old child feels good and positive about going to the dentist/Orthodontics, that really sums it up.  Great job team.<//Text>

< review>
This place deserves an EXTRA 6th STAR RATING!!
At first I was hesitant to come to the dentist & after hearing great things about this office, still was afraid to make that first appointment due to past experiences at other offices. But then I decided to give them a try! From the moment I made the call I felt already welcomed & they offer same day appointment which was a relief as im a busy working mom. Finally I went to my appointment and all I can say i was very pleased with my choice! Big shout out to Jessica, Lindsay, Sam, Monica, Jaime, Liz, Sally, Vincent,  Dr. Mike, & Dr. Badii for going above & beyond for all my dental needs! Im not great with remembering names but that is how comfortable i feel every time i come to my appointments.

P.S. It felt like a spa even when my teeth were getting cleaned! If you know what I mean to all you moms out there! 😁< /review>

<review>I absolutely 100% recommend this place! I was looking for a dentist that I could get into quickly to get some Overdue things taken care of. I made a call on Monday and to my surprise and they made an appointment for me the next day. I got my x-rays done my evaluation done and then half of my mouth cleaned. I came in today Friday to get the remainder of my cleaning done and had the pleasure of having the hygienist Miguel take care of me. I am more than pleased by my results and extremely satisfied with the care he provided.</review>< user_id>

<Text>Had amazing experience at OC smile. It started off by googling the best place to get my sons teeth whitened. After calling several places for teeth whitening. OC smile recommended me to have my son have his teeth examined and cleaned before Getting them whitened. I felt they had my son’s best interest in mind other than just collecting money for teeth whitening. Would definitely recommend OC smile in Fullerton to anybody.< /Text>< pictures>

I was super nervous walking to my consultation appointment. When I got there, the front desk staff was very pleasant and polite, greeted me and helped with paper work for new patients. When I did the walk of shame to the back, Dr Badii was such a genuine guy that the whole experience was laid back and completely comfortable. He treated me kindly and I would recommend his practice to the whole world!!! Thanks, Dr Badii!!!<//Text>

Dr. J was quick with the treatment. I'm not a big fan of anesthesia but he was deft and efficient with the needle. I had my fillings done in 1/2 hour.</review>

Worst dentist experience I've ever had. Had no idea what my appointment was for even though I scheduled it in person and discussed everything the day before. Be sure not to move at all or flinch anything in the chair or they will immediately stop servicing you. Decided halfway through my wisdom tooth procedure to send me home just because he felt I was nervous when I sat still through the whole thing. Ridiculous. NEVER GO HERE.</Text>

{'time': 1540673956760, 'text': 'Dear Sonia,\n\nThank you for your feedback and perspective.  OC Smile is 100% committed to our patients and the communities we serve. It’s apparent that you feel we fell short on delivering our 4 core values of: Service, Quality, Care, and Compassion "after the ortho experience".  I believe part of \'the experience\' is being consistent,... and showing up twice in 3 years is difficult for any doctor to manage.  We\'re confident that your son\'s experience with our new Board Certified Orthodontist and new team members will be much better.  I\'m hopeful you\'ll give us the opportunity to earn your trust.\n\nEither way, it\'s great that we were able to safely remove the braces that were placed by a different doctor under different ownership (nearly 7 years ago).  Please let us know if there\'s any further services we can provide you or your family.  You may call us at (714) 441-1414, or send us an email at, Care@OCSmile.com.\n\nYours in Health!\n\nOC Smile Management'}<//Response>

All at the same time. It took two attempts to remove my wisdom tooth because the first person was under qualified. The second person was great. But service went downhill from there. They never keep appointments, and I never see an actual dentist to consult me when work is needed. Very unprofessional office.<//review>< pictures>

I have been seen by the team  at OC Smile in Fullerton for a several years now. I enjoy Lucy the Manager, she is a wonderful person and  very accomodating and helpful. Her eagerness to assist anyone is so refreshing. I sincerely appreciate Lucy. There is no one more awesome than my hygienist Monica. What I appreciate is her patience. She is so wonderful and I would recommend her talent to amyone. The girls at the front desk are fabulous, friendly and helpful. What I really like about OC Smile is they text you for appts, fun days with prizes, always keeping us informed. OC Smile even does charity fund raisers and helping the community is what warms the soul. Thank you everyone at OC Smile, I appreciate all you do.

Tired of greasy Chinese food ? Try their sauteed Tao Myo (pea stem) in garlic sauce. I recommend this dish in March ~ May, due to the tenderness of this veggie. Try it, you will not be sorry ! It has a very delicate & light flavor. A satisfaction guaranteed ! Also, I like their pan fried rice vermicelli dish, Taiwanese cabbage with thick pieces of bacon, which goes well with pork belly over rice.< /review>

Love going to this place. The food is excellent. The dish I love the most is the fish in a broth of spicy soup with spinach.  Chicken in clay pot with basil and garlic sauce is a must try for those who likes to eat chicken. The drink of choice for me would be Taiwan beer. They have pork belly with garlic sauce as a appetizer. Every time I go there I would try something new. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to try Taiwanese cuisine.< /text>

<Name>Ty Lim<//Name><Time>1382672628479<//Time><rate>4</rate><text>In terms of food, this place is pretty good. Most of the dishes taste pretty authentic and are quite scrumptious. The service is also pretty quick and good, and they're one of the few Taiwanese restaurants in the city that can accommodate a large group on short notice. The only real drawback to this place is the lack of parking in the area. Aside from that, I'd give it a thumbs up!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

A Taiwanese friend took us here and we had a delicious meal. My favorite dish was beef noodle soup. The rice and salt & pepper chicken were also delicious. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was a plate with cold tofu, seaweed, and pig's ears. The people working there were very kind. There were only a few tables, though I wasn't clear if there was an upstairs also. I saw a staircase, but I don't know where it went.<//review>

This is the best place to get ramen in the city. That's not to say they don't have other good foods because everything I've tried has been delicious. Having lived in San Francisco for 7 years and spent some time in Asia, I feel I' qualified to say this. Sanei the owner is lovely and cooks some delicious, authentic Asian food. Pro tip: if you ask her, her husband will come dressed as a clown, sing you happy birthday and blow balloons😊😊😊<//text>

<text>Honestly, bland Taiwanese food, besides the stinky tofu.  I remember it tasting better than that, when my mom would make it at home or when you get it at the night market in Taiwan.  Not worth the trip, plus they can't even speak Taiwanese in there!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

It's funny what people like. One of my Chinese American friends found this place and loved it. Said he'd been looking for a place this good every since he moved away from L.A. But his friend, Taiwanese American who lives in L.A. says it's not so good. Not authentic. Another Taiwanese America friend in SF agrees.

As for me, I've been mostly happy. The sticky rice, the spicy wantons, the scallion pancakes, their tantan noodles, the pitan tofu, the sliced pork with garlic. I'm sure there is better in the bay area but I don't know better in the city. If there is tell me where and I'll go< /review>

<review>One of the few places that is almost authentic Taiwanese food. The beef noodle is a hearty staple, and the dan dan noodles were well seasoned. The oyster omelette was tasty, though it had mussels instead of oysters. They have a parking lot a few blocks down, but the parking isn't too bad in the neighborhood to begin with.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Just avoid this place. I came in late but I don't think that's a good enough excuse for how fatty and gross their pork is here. Ewww for real. I always tip but they have a 20 minimum on a debit card and I had barely enough cash. Not a good experience. And I hate fish and it stinks really bad in there, lol.<//Review>

Love this location. Usually busy but the service is very quick. Friendly staff and clean environment. The pizza portal is a great device keeps your food hot if you cannot make it on time for the 15 minutes it takes to get there.</Review>

<text>Pros+
*🍕Pizza and Cheese bread etc pretty good taste for the value price.
*Area well lit
*Appears clean inside and outside storefront.

Aress that need improvement-
*Customer service etiquette could be more professional.

*Staff often fail to pay attention to order details.  Making errors in creating menu items leaving Customer burdened to lengthened wait time for staff to remake dish.  Despite Customer clarifying prior to order placement.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Is it normal to not have pizzas listed as hot and ready from 4-8pm unavailable? I know it’s a 12 minute cook time. But I didn’t come here for the food quality. I came here to walk in and walk out with what I wanted. That’s your gimmick. Maybe if the employees focused on making pizzas and not chatting or then there would be hot and ready pizzas.<//Text><rate>1</rate></record></dataset><record>

Very fast service. Always nice to have basic orders ready in minutes. I would recommend ordering special pizzas in advance and just go to pick it up.</Text>

<Review>I placed an order over the phone for 2 pizzas and when I went to go pick them up and was ready to pay I decided I also wanted to add FRESH chicken wings to my order. I wanted 2 orders of buffalo wings and in the food warmer there was only 1 box of wings so they advised that there would be a 10 minute wait for another batch to which I agreed towards waiting, but I requested both of my orders be fresh since I was going to wait an additional 10 minutes for 1 batch of wings. The employee denied me getting both of my batches fresh stating they would only make 1 because they already had 1 in the warmer and that would be wasting food. Automatically thinking that thats bad customer service because he was denying me fresh food to which I was going to pay for as well as wait, I started recording with my phone. I asked him whether that was a policy of Little Ceasers to deny a customers request for fresh food and he stated yes it was there policy. He then returned me my money and denied me service period to which at no point did I ever say anything rude or out of normality but try and verify as to why I was getting denied service for fresh food. They threaten to call the cops automatically for wanting to finish my order I did not insist therefore I left the place I will never go back to this exact location ever again</Review><name>Gael Lo</name>< Gmap_id>

Great customer service I would give it five stars but my order is never ready when they say it is. I like my hot and ready well done they say 15 mins really it's about 25 mins. Overall I still like it they give extra pepperoni when I order it this way<//Review>

Online order through their app was no where to be found. Not very pleasant reordering at the location. When we finally did get our order pizza was delicious.</text>

Rarely hot and ready, but it's because they're popular. The pizza is decent (not amazing, but tasty) and very inexpensive. The logical choice for feeding a herd of teenagers :)< /Review>

When I was calling around looking for car insurance, I called State Farm and got Kenny Davis on the phone and he was super nice and helped me understand what I needed and what was best for me. So I made an appointment and ended up walking out with car insurance and life insurance! He’s very knowledgeable about his information and explains it in a way you understand! I highly suggest this office to everyone I know! Mr. Davis will keep you laughing every time you call him with help!<//review>

Had such a great experience with Mr. Davis. Very professional from the quote to getting my policies in place. He made sure I understood what my policies covered. He also made sure I got the coverage I needed and nothing more. Didn’t try and push other products on me which I appreciate. Walked me through setting up my account on-line. Overall very satisfied with my new policies. Great job Mr. Davis keep up the outstanding work.</text>

Typically dealing with anything insurance related is a nightmare, but the staff here made it bearable. I was originally contacted by Kasey Ericsson regarding an open claim. Prior to contact with Kasey, I had difficulty with the claims team at State Farm getting consistent and accurate information regarding my claim. Despite not being a part of the claims team, Kasey assigned herself to my case just so she could ease my frustration. From there it improved drastically. She set calendar reminders to check in with me and provide updates, she handled all communications with my claims team, and patiently and professionally answered all questions I had throughout the process. I commend her for her high level of organization, prompt responses, strong and compassionate communication skills, and her willingness to go above and beyond for her clients. Had it not been for Kasey, I probably would have lost my mind trying to deal with all of this. She has since been deemed my "claim angel".  I would definitely do business with her and this office again. Thank you Kasey!<//text>< Gmap_id>

So I listened to her and moved my insurance to Johnny's office and I couldn't have made a better choice. Not only are Johnny and his staff knowledgable and friendly but they really made me feel like I am being taken care of. When I got into a fender bender I was freaking out but all I did was call Johnny's office and they were there for me and walked me through the process step by step which calmed me down. I would recommend him to anyone. He makes you feel valued and seems to really be in your corner. Great agent, great staff!</Text>< pictures>

I got a setup with Johnny with my car insurance, motorcycle insurance, and life insurance. He was extremely helpful and sat down with me to explain everything I needed to know about insurance because I was very uneducated on the subject before. I felt that I was valued as a customer and was treated with much respect. I wish I could give more than 5 stars because he is the best insurance agent around!!!</Text>

Kenny helped me out in a huge pinch! I needed business insurance ASAP and I was up against a wall. He was not only professional but made the process super laid back. He was informational and really worked hard to find me a great rate. We were able to get me insured really quick and I have peace of mind! I highly recommend him.</Text>

my husband and I met Kenny at the fair of last year and he has helped us with everything from life insurance to renters. he not only helped us with learning about life insurance he made it fun, he's not just a typical guy who will sell you anything he actually cares and will help you whenever needed. I have gone to an agent there which just wanted to sell me something but Kenny took over and explained and helped. I would choose him over anyone. truly recommend him, I shopped around and this place is far the best. 100% recommend< /text>

<text>I recently bought my first car and I needed to insure the car before I drove it off the lot. This was my first time applying for insurance on my own, so I had a lot of questions. The whole process was extremely difficult and tedious since I was trying to find the best quote. Thankfully I called Statefarm, and Kenny was able the help me through the whole process. He was available anytime I needed him and made my overall experience great!< /text>< Date>

Johnny’s office is hands down the best State Farm in California. I’ve been hit and was able to get in a rental the same day and get my car started in the repair process. The claim was quick and handled extremely well. Definitely recommend, their prices are competitive and the coverage is better than any other company.<//Text>

Mr. Williamson is literally the best agent I have  ever dealt with on a professional level not only did he support us during our recent accident claim but also felt the need to help us out beyond what any other agent would have. Mr. Williamson sincerely cares about his clients and literally would go out of his way and bend over backwards for them. there's is literally no better agent that I have ever came into contact with. Mr. Williamson thank you so much for being there for our family and supporting us even though our own insurance company would not! Eventually we got the insurance company to listen to our version of the story and had everything overturned in our favor due to Mr. Williamson's continued support! If there was a higher rating for Johnny it would be a 15 out of 10! Johnny is a great agent! I Highly recommend Johnny Williamson and his professional office!  in addition his staff he's also fantastic we were treated nothing less than family cannot thank Johnny Williamson enough!< /Review>

State Farm is a great company. Agents like Johnny and his team always take the time to go the extra mile to service their clients. I highly recommend Johnny's office for all of your Insurance needs. They are smart, honest, and they treat you like family.< /text>

I met with Johnny to go over my policies and ensure that I was properly covered. He took the time to explain all of my options and was able to increase my coverage as well as save me money on my premiums!! All of the people in his office are very nice as well! I will be recommending him to any of my friends and family looking to change or add to their insurance needs.<//text>

<review>Johnny is the best! When I bought my first home, I was very nervous about homeowners insurance because I knew nothing about it. Johnny sat down with me and explained what exactly was involved and what was/wasn't covered. I was so happy to finally understand that I transferred my auto insurance over to State Farm and got an extra discount for having multiple policies. I'm also considering signing up for Life Insurance because I know Johnny will set me up with the best policy that is still affordable for me.</review>< Date>

I have been with State Farm many years and when I met Johnny, I found him to be very helpful and a caring person.  He has a great staff, always friendly and knows the value of a satisfied client.  He is open on Saturdays and is available on his cell phone most of the time.  If you're shopping for house or car insurance or need a quote for Life Insurance, do your due diligence and meet with Johnny first.  You're not only getting a great company, State Farm, but a professional who is going to take care of your insurance needs.  A real people person!< /Review>

<text>I don't even know where to begin.... NEVER in my adult life have I had an insurance company or agent do as much for me as Johnny and his team have done for me! I always had some random, whole in the wall insurance provider in which I paid  the minimum so I wouldn't get a ticket for not having insurance. About 4 years ago I decided to switch over to State Farm (which was also inexpensive) after hearing nothing but GREAT things about them. I didn't realize that not only had I switched over to THEE BEST insurance company out there, I also got THEE BEST Insurance Agent EVER!! I got in an accident just a few months ago and boy was I a nervous wreck! (literally)... I called up Johnny, who was out with his family,  (who also was sincerely concerned for my safety) and told him that I had got in an accident and told him my location and within 15-20 minutes after my phone call to him, I had a tow truck at my service getting me and my poor bruised Camry off of the road and into a body shop. This was on a Friday evening  AND he even had the rental agency provide me with a rental car. I was and still am so very thankful that Johnny is my agent!! He went above and beyond what any insurance agent has ever done for me. I would recommend Johnny Williamson to any and every person in this world because I know he will not disappoint them!</text>< Pictures>

<text>For my home, I had gone to Johnny for insurance a few years back. He honestly said that what I had was good. A couple of years ago once more I approached him, this time by switching there was a substantial  savings.

My wife and I went to a lot of companies and got a lot of quotes for auto insurance but we didnt really get the service we were looking for. Johnny gave us a lot of good information and tips. He really helped us with everything and we even saved money by combining our renters and auto insurance! Johnny is the best at what he does.</text>

The worst insurance and insurance agent I've ever had. Never once did I ever talk to my agent but only to his office workers. they worse than fake news, will promise you in the longer term for reduced auto rates but will always come back with some excuse and raise my rates. been with them for 2 years and NEVER ONCE worked with me to lower rates and did the TOTAL OPPOSITE. STAY AWAY. Absolute leeches.</review>
<resp>{'time': 1530907535705, 'text': 'Hi Boback,\nI am sorry about your negative experience regarding your State Farm auto rates.  Unfortunately, State Farm Agents and Team Members do not have influence over State Farm premiums except to make sure that you are receiving the discounts you are entitled to.  Things like tickets and address changes also have an impact on our premiums. I believe that both of those circumstances were a part of your situation.

<rate>5< /rate><text>I would just like to share my experience with Johnny Williamson and his Staff.  I am the new version of Shelp-Rock.  Last yeas I got T-Boned in my Paid Off Truck on a Sunday and I called Johnny directly on his cell phone (No One Hurt) and he got me a rental the same day.  The truck was a total loss and so I got a check by the end of the week and was in a new truck by the following Sunday.

Just last month I got my Big Box Truck Stolen and when we recovered it 5 days later it was damaged beyond repair so it too was totaled.  State Farm did not argue the value and got me a fair check for the replacement of my Box Truck.

Overall I have to say that Johnny and His Staff are spot on and right their to help when ever you need them.  I would recommend them to anyone and have.<//text>< pictures>

My wife and i have been getting quotes on our life auto and business and we found johnny williamson with state farm to have the best in service and price. most people would think otherwise but we got prices from other insurance co in bakersfield but no one even came close to the price and coverage and most important the service!!!. i would really really suggest you call his office for a free quote today we are very happy with his service great staff thx  and also they told me they do banking we will be checking into that soon< /text>

Neat place to check out. Astronomy museum and a number of telescopes. Mt. Wilson Observatory had the largest telescopes in the world for many years. There is a cute Cafe and great views and hiking all around the mountain.</Review>

Love going up here to get out of town.

The observatory is great and I always learn so much. Stop at the Cosmic Cafe for a snack in season.</Review>

Absolutely wonderful experience where we scheduled a summer fun learning expedition high atop Mt Wilson touring the observatory that to this very day is currently employed by astronomers still researching the stars, planets & galaxies above! Lots of captivating history of this phenomenal place as our tour guide, Jed, offered extremely knowledgeable facts, dates, names figures of Mt Wilson and at the same time would tell stories of old making the tour all the more intriguing for us all. We "Highly" recommend Mt Wilson as an event you need to plan as unlike The Griffith Observatory, with all due respect is commercialized, Mt Wilson is truly an observatory that is real & in operation today used by scientist from around the world as well as USC & UCLA Colleges. During the 1pm 2 hr tour we got to see many of the telescopes & was allowed in the 100 ft. tower where a "100 Ton" telescope is still currently in use. There is also in theory the "Worlds Largest" Telescope on site! There are wonderful hiking trails close by & picnic areas if you wish to have lunch with the family or café with basic food & drinks to quench your appetite. The aprox 5700ft elevation offers spectacular views of the city below on one side & Pacifico Mtn, and the 10,000ft San Antonio Mtn. on the other side! This trip/tour is fun for families, couples, singles, adventurists, outdoor enthusiast, hikers, bikers, walkers etc. Do check out the online website for more detailed information however there is no phone # to call for personal q & a.
High elevation provides slightly cooler weather up there & very nice breeze at times makes it very pleasant even during a heat spell when we went. We loved this trip & are planning to make this an annual event for the family!<//review>

Wilson has a beautiful hiking trail rich with nature and peaceful animals such as cubs, bears, snakes, etc...
It’s 8 hours hiking to both ends- do it spring or summer:) Good luck...</text>

<text>Mount Wilson has an elevation of 5,710 feet and is home to the Mount Wilson Observatory and also the home of an antenna farm known as radio row.  These antennas are used for broadcasting radio and TV signals to the greater Los Angeles area.  Mount Wilson also boasts its own Post Office.  You can find the small facility at 23 Video Road.  The antennas hum with electricity and have the ability to raise the hair on your head.  The views from Mount Wilson are spectacular on a clear day.  At the top you may be able to see the Channel Islands, San Clemente Island.  The horizon that you see over the ocean is actually 92 miles in the distance.</text><gmapID>0x80c2dd7871e3babb:0x94e3545e7f721aff< /gmapID>< time>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Come here with Tri, my son, on the 3rd of the Year of the Rat. Trong Hien leads in to the Hubble telescope. This is the place to discover the expansion of the universe, the most important discovery in astronomy.
The view was wonderful, there was still snow, but the walk did not feel much cold. The pass is quite long but very clean. A memory to remember!

Đã đến đây cùng Trí, con trai cưng, hôm mùng 3 Tết Canh Tý. Trọng Hiền dẫn vào xem kính thiên văn Hubble. Đây là nơi khám phá ra sự giãn nở của vũ trụ, một khám phá quan trọng bậc nhất của ngành Thiên văn học.
Cảnh đẹp tuyệt vời, vẫn còn tuyết, nhưng đi dạo không thấy lạnh bao nhiêu. Đường đèo khá dài nhưng rất sạch. Một kỷ niệm đang nhớ!<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Wonderful air up here!
Very nice view over LA and the surrounding area.
The museums are interesting. It is only asked for a donation. I like to throw something in there.

Watch out! If LA downtown is 30 ° C, then this is cold up here. Take your jacket with you! Otherwise it will be a short visit.
Also suitable for children and strollers.

A nice place to look, relax and enjoy.

(Original)
Herrliche Luft hier oben!
Sehr schöne Aussicht über LA und Umland.
Die Museen sind interessant. Es wird nur um eine Spende gebeten. Da werfe ich doch gerne was rein.

Achtung! Wenns in LA Innenstadt 30°C sind, dann ist das hier oben kalt. Jacke auf jeden Fall mitnehmen! Das wird sonst ein kurzer Besuch.
Auch für Kinder und Kinderwagen geeignet.

Ein schöner Ort zum schauen, entspannen und genießen.< /Text>< GmapID>

We had Chris Hayes come out to help us with our older AC unit. He was quick and efficient.  He provided an honest and thorough summary of the issue and offered us several options to choose fun. He was not pushy about which option to choose. We would recommend Chris!</Review>

Professional, quick and friendly. They lost a star because they left a mess behind and two tools (that required phone calls and waiting for someone to come and pick it up), as well as a new AC that wouldn't turn off for 24 hours. They came right out and fixed the problem and it runs perfectly now!

They worked within my budget and came out quickly to fix an AC that broke in the middle of summer.< /Review>

<Date>1623362311935< /Date><rating>5<//rating><review>Chris Hayes just performed my a/c maintenance for Summer'21.  When the appointment was made, just two days before, I was expecting Richard Samkas,  however, Chris was available and arrived on time.  He wore his red, white, and blue, face mask the entire time he was at my home, carefully put on his boot covers and quickly went to work replacing my filters, including wiping down any dust and webs..  He went out to the unit and verified the efficiency of this 20 year old American Standard equipment, hosing off the cobwebs and accumulated dust.   Then came back inside to explain his findings, which were very encouraging for this homeowner.  Nothing needed to be replaced or even "keep and eye on."  When asked if there was anything else he could do for me, I quickly pointed to a chore I had been putting off because of my knees.  He very humbly rolled up an air mattress for me.  Such a GENTLEMAN!  Thank you Climate Care.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I used Climate Care for the first time today and Joe was my technician. He found that I needed freon and thoroughly checked my system for a leak, in order to confirm that is what was needed. Joe explained to me all of the steps he was taking. He was thorough and knowledgeable. I was also happy that he mentioned the monthly service contract and I gladly signed up.</Text>

Chris Hayes did an amazing job for us on very short notice.  He was actually a little early to our house, which was appreciated, and went right to our system.  He knew exactly what to do to get the system running again and was very helpful in explaining what he was doing while he was working.  Very pleasant to work with, and we will definitely use Chris for all of our AC needs in the future.  I was very impressed with his knowledge about systems and his professionalism.  We are very happy customers!!</review>

Chris Hayes was AWESOME!! Great wealth of knowledge and very helpful. He was able to help my elderly parents with their AC unit. Times are tough and he was able to explain what their options would be and will be back to go through those options in order to get them the best value and a new unit. Thanks again Chris for all your help.</review>

Also taught me a little bit about my system and gave me all of the options for me to look over moving forward. Definitely recommend!< /Text>< pics>

<review>Joe went above and beyond what he needed to do for a simple AC tune-up.  He not only completely that efficiently but also helped us with our fence that had nothing to do with the unit.  Incredible.  You don't find that kind of service, or even people, very much anymore.  Thank you so much, Climate Care, for doing your due diligence in hiring good people!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Chris Hayes was an exception to his company. We all wish to have more employees as natural and honest as Chris.  With us being 80’s and on medical repair, he was very polite and thorough with everything he did.  I definitely recommend him to my friends and people who need help.   We enjoyed him.

Today I had the pleasure to meet Joe he came out to my house to service my ac. He was thorough and very knowledgeable. He even helped to fix a miscommunication between myself and his main office . He quickly jumped in to fix the situation which left me happy. I signed up again for another year for servicing my ac and heating unit. $69.00 is a great deal to come and do a 21 point system check in the winter for my heating  system and in the summer for my AC. Like $34.50 per system. Thank you Joe !!!<//text>

I had my AC unit installed by Climate Care in 2017. I have only used Climate Care for the servicing of my unit. I recently had a maintenance done on my unit and there were a few items that weren't done correctly. I reached out to Climate Care and they reassured me they wanted to make things right. A supervisor named Oscar was sent out to my house and he was amazing. He contacted me to let me know when he was arriving and he was extremely polite and professional. He educated me on my system and answered all my questions. He went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied and he fixed the issues I had experienced. I have never had any issued previously with anyone at Climate Care. They are good people that care about their clients and want their clients to be happy with their product and work. I will always request Oscar to do the servicing of my system as he is the perfect example of professional, courteous customer service and satisfaction.< /review>

<text>Oscar was great!  He quickly determined why I was getting so little air through my upstairs vents.  Despite newer installation there were gaps affecting the airflow.  He figured the issue out quickly and was able to maneuver through my small attic to repair the problem.  What a difference it made! I’m so glad that my neighbor referred me to your company and Oscar in particular!< /text></record>

<review>In the Fall of 2016 we purchased a new heating and air conditioning unit from Climate Care. Twice a year we receive maintenance service on our unit. Climate Care has consistently provided excellent service via their service technicians. Today, our service technicians were Oscar and Ivan. They both presented themselves in a professional, respectable, and knowledgeable manner. They informed us of their service club membership, which is a great deal and we signed up for it today. Kudos go out to Climate Care!</review>< pictures>

<Text>The comfort advisor Richard Samkas came out today and worked around my work schedule, Richard worked with the owner of the company to get me the best deal possible. Climate Care gave the best prices and warranties hands down and the best part is they can install as soon as tomorrow which is very impressive!

Chris Hayes
So I though my AC stopped working and was blowing hot air. Stressed and all I called and asked for referrals. I got a nice message from Jeni at climate care and she was so nice and professional. She was able to her a tech out same day and they sent out the most Courteous tech out named Chris. He was patient worked hard getting my system back up and running. Turned out not to be the unit but the electrical problem and with the crowed web of wires from the pool and solar he found my problem!! Hands down they will have my job when we replace the system.< /Review>

I recently had HVAC replaced by Climate Care. All staff members exhibited great customer service and were prompt in responding. My husband and I met w/Chris on a Friday and had an appointment for installation the following Tuesday. Just in time before the hot weather hit us! There were some minor details after installation. I called Chris who responded within minutes and had someone out the next day. Extremely happy with their service. Highly recommend this team to anyone needing to replace HVAC system.< /Review>

Chris Hayes was our tech and it was our second visit with him since 2019.  He was punctual (early), friendly, knowledgeable and we would recommend him to friends and or family if in need of someone to service their ac or heating systems.  He also repaired our ac motor last year on our 12 year old system.  STAND UP GUY< /Review>

Richard Samkas came to our house to perform a much needed service on our HVAC system and was great!  He walked me through everything he was doing, helped me understand how the system works, and what could make it work better for our house.  He even gave my dogs some love :)</review>

<resp>None</resp><review>ClimateCare installed both my AC / Heating systems (upstairs and downstairs) three years ago and have been here doing an annual checkup ever since. Great people to work with. Miguel was great, he knew what he was doing, was great at communicating both during the visit and prior to the visit, so I knew exactly what time he was arriving<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We has the tech out to our home today from Climate Care named Richard Samkas! Richard was very quick and efficient on getting our AC up and running again on a 108 degree day! Richard provided expert skill and professionalism while working on our AC! Richard had been in thebtrade for many years and knows exactly what hes doing and talking about. We highly recommend Senior Technician Richard Samkas to anyone in need of a expert HVAC guy!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Richard Samkas, a senior tech came to my house to inspect both units we have. He was professional and courteous and took his time to explain all the technical details of everything that’s going on with them. He didn’t pressure me into buying anything, just gave honest opinion and information and showed us photos of the units that we can’t see in the attic. Highly recommend!</Text>

Senior tech Richard Samkas came out to my home today to perform my annual VIP club membership AC tune up! Richard has been here a few times! Richard always performs a five star service he always comes to me and asked me if there’s anything extra that he can do for me to put a big smile on my face! Richard is always courteous and kind and he is always willing to go the extra mile to make the service provided extra special, thanks climate Care and Richard!<//Text>

<text>Senior Technician Richard Samkas was absolutely amazing! Richard came to my home today to perform a $59 Diagnostic due to my AC not working. Richard took my AC apart, got down to the compressors wires, ohmed out my compressor with his multi-meter and found that my compressor was faulty and shorted to ground! Richard is a real HVAC professional! I highly recommend Senior Service Technician to come to your home to do a Diagnostic if your heater or AC is not working! Richards recommendations are great! He is the best service tech I have ever had out to my home! Thanks again Richard Samkas!<//text><rating>5< /rating><user_name>Fatima Mornan<//user_name>< gmap_id>

Richard came into my home and wore his floor savers on his boots to protect my hard wood floors! Richard followed Covid-19 protocol to the fullest as he wore his mask while in my home! Senior tech Richard Samkas has excellent customer service and explains the promotions well through Climate Care! We really love the idea of the Stealth Pro 7.0 Quiet Cool whole house fan with wireless remote but we are selling our home this year! I know by Richard leaving me with the Quiet Cool whole house fan brochure the new home buyers will take full advantage! Thanks for being such a valuable person and technician Mr. Richard Samkas! You are a true Heating and Air Conditioning specialist! I highly recommend Richard Samkas at Climate Care to all my friends and family!

<Review>Richard was the service provider for our home.  He was responsive to all inquiries and clearly explained what maintenance was conducting and what future repairs may be needed.  I would strongly recommend Manteca Climate Care to friends and family.  I will be calling in the Spring/Summer to this company conduct maintenance on our air conditioners!  Thanks Richard!<//Review>< Rate>

Senior technician Richard Samkas was great! He came out here in the summer to do a $39 AC tune up and did a fantastic job! We had some thermostat issues and decided to call 6 months later and ask for Richard to come out and take a look at it! Richards professionalism as a senior service tech is absolutely spectacular! Thanks Richard and Climate Care I will recommend you to my friends and family!<//text>

Senior Service Technician Richard Samkas came to my home today to perform a $39 furnace tune up! Richard has very good information, explained a lot of things I was not aware of concerning the safety inspection Richard performed on my 20 year old furnace. Thanks for your professionalism and being so informative! I would recommend Richard Samkas and Climate care to anyone in need of heating and AC service! We will be using these guys again in the near future! Thanks again!<//review>

Oscar was very informative about our 17 year old HVAC system that we called to have tuned up.
He provided insight on the components and what they do as well as our options for a new HVAC system.
We feel comfortable with using Climate Change when we are ready to replace our HVAC system,  based on Oscar's representation.</Text>

<Review>Senior service tech Richard  Samkas  has been doing tune ups on my HVAC equipment for a few years now! Richard hands down is knowledgeable, always on time, very professional, and personable.  Richard gave me the best deal possible on a new 4 ton upflow split system! There's not a single company around  that could come near Climate Cares  price on a new unit! Thanks Richard and Climate Care for the deal of a life time! I will recommend you to friends and family! Thanks again! See you Monday for the install!< /Review><Time>1618088001081<//Time><user>117851014026973765049<//user><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<time>1620141207446</time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>In the summer of 2019 my A/C unit failed. Climate Care was one of the bidders with whom I consulted. They were not the low bid but because of the rapport I developed with Chris (no longer with the company apparently) I chose Climate Care for the job. This job was completed to my satisfaction for the most part. I had some additional cleanup work to do after the installation team left. Not a big deal.
At the time, I wanted to add a whole house fan but finances dictated otherwise. Moving on to the summer of 2020, I contacted Chris about adding the whole house fan. Again, Climate Care was not the low bidder but I chose them for the job. This time, however, my level of satisfaction with the job is essentially nil. The unit is much louder than I anticipated, but since I don't run it for long periods of time, I can live with it. Not a big deal.
Now comes the major issues... There was some minor damage done to the ceiling near the install site. The location of the damage is in a most difficult spot to access otherwise it would be pretty easy for a pro to repair. One of the techs offered to change out the return air filters for the HVAC system, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, the tech bent up the return air framework in the process. Now that needs to be replaced. I brought this up with Climate Care after the install. I was told it would be taken care of. Not long after the install, the HVAC system quit working completely. I called Climate Care about that issue and a tech was dispatched to check it out. The tech's diagnoses was that there was no AC power going to the HVAC unit. I brought in an electrician to find the root cause. He found that a wire nut, that was used to daisy-chain power to the whole house fan was incorrectly sized and improperly installed causing an arcing condition between conductors in the wire nut. The arcing caused enough heat to melt and burn the wire nut. (This could have resulted in a fire!) Fortunately, the arcing was short-lived and the wire nut self-extinguished. The electrician repaired that connection and restored power to the HVAC unit.
I have made REPEATED calls to Climate Care to fix the damage that was done to the ceiling. Only once was a tech sent to inspect the damage. He said, "That's going to be hard to fix in that location." (Yeah, no kidding!) Again, I've called and called and called. ZERO response is what I've received. I just get told, "Someone will get back to you." It has been nearly 11 months now. I think that's been more than enough time to resolve this. I have come to the conclusion that Climate Care couldn't "CARE" less. It appears that I will have to hire someone to fix the damage on my own. I'm not sure if I can get reimbursed through small claims court or whatever I need to do. It shouldn't have come to this point. It did. I've run out of patience.

Bottom line? I would highly recommend finding another company to fill your HVAC needs. Climate Care does not back up their work/workmanship!<//Text>< Pictures>

After being three hours early and discussing my breaker with the technician he decided to ask if my husband was home as if I could not comprehend what he was saying because I am a woman.

Chris Hayes knows what he's talking about. He's very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. We never felt pressured to make a quick decesion. We took our time and Chris walked us through it. He gave us advice and options. We felt comfortable and we bought a new AC/ and heating system within our budget. Juan and his partener did an out standing job installing ducts and a AC and heating unit.  They also installed a new Thermostat which we love beause it's bluetooth and i can control it from my phone. Overall I had an outstanding experience with Climate care. They really took care of us and treated us like family. They are professional and take pride in their work. I recommand Climate Care to anyone.</Text>

Our great experience was first with Diane. Diane was very helpful with assisting us with all the information we will need in choosing the right company and the correct unit.  On the day of our appt, we were greeted with Chris.  He was very respectful using the correct coverings this pandemic has put us in.  He's pleasant and knowledgeable, didn't make you feel dumb asking questions and informative in explaining the steps of his estimate.  Then finally the two gents that installed our new parts. They were efficient and cleanly with the installation.  Would have never known they were there in the closet if it wasn't for tiny specks of installation on the floor, otherwise very good.  Highly recommend this company for your heating and A/C needs.  Great job guys!!!<//Review>

My husband and I were very cautious when it came to selecting someone to entrust with our AC and Heating. Our AC was undersized for our home and heating was not great, so I called several different companies to come out and give me estimates.  One of the companies I called was Climate Care.   A gentleman by the name Chris H. was the Senior Tech, I felt like he was very trustworthy.  He talks about what equipment they would use and how much it would take to be installed. Chris H. was super knowledgeable about the whole procedure and had a great work ethic.  Chris H. also took time to explain anything I didn’t understand.  Chris H. worked out a deal that that was imposable to say no to.  He always listened to any special requests I had and was eager to make sure it was done the way that I wanted.  Believe me, I'm very picky.  Then Chris H. tells me they actually had a opening to install the next day.  The next day they were here to install the AC/Heat unit.  The lead on the job was Oscar R. I was very impressed with the attention to detail that Oscar R. and his crew used on the install.  They actually finished that day and made sure everything was cleaned up...You can tell they all take great pride in their work.  Diana K. in the office was always very helpful with any questions or help.  So far, the equipment seems to be working perfect and the price was more than reasonable compared to other companies.
I highly recommend Climate Care they are an A+ in my book.  Everything was done over and above anything I could have wanted.  I would definitely request Chris or Oscar in any future projects... I highly recommend Climate Care are is as good as it gets.</Text>

Senior Service tech Richard Samkas is a real honest technician! I was having some construction work done on my house! My home was built in 2016. I called Climate Care and Stephen the dispatcher sent out Senior Tech Richard Samkas! Thanks Stephen for sending out such an honest tech! Richard found that the construction workers turned off the breakers which was not allowing my AC to turn on! Richard found the issue real fast! He had me as the home owner flip the AC breaker on and the AC became operational as it should! Richard did not charge me for the quick fix! I highly recommend Richard due to him having so much integrity! Thanks Senior Tech Richard Samkas I will for sure recommend you to my friends and family for heating and air conditioning!</Text>

Richard Samakas was our technician. He showed up right at our appointment time, was very respectful, and wore a mask and booties inside my home. His diagnosis of my ac unit was quick & he was very thorough in explaining our options and possible pay plans to me. He even cleaned off our ac unit outside & checked the duct in the attic. I am very pleased with my experience with this company & looking forward to an ac update with them.<//text>

Senior Service tech Richard Samkas came out for a diagnostic on my AC today, Richard was very professional, courteous, had great recommendations, and options. Richard wore a cace mask in my house which was greatly appreciated due to the covid-19 virus going on. Thanks Richard and Climate Care! I highly appreciate your help today!< /Review>

After a few minor hiccups my heating and cooling system is working good. Thanks to Oscar for working hard to accomplish the job after picking up the slack of the install crew.
We are pleased that’s it’s all good now!</review>

<Review>I called for ac repair service.  Upon arrival, the tech reviews the problem at hand and before anything is removed, I’m quoted a price for parts.  Only a visual inspection had been done and he didn’t even know the part type that was needed.  I was then quoted an exorbitant and excessive price for a common part known for failure. I made sure he knew that!  I attempted to speak with the owner of the company to address the potential price gouging that I experienced.  I only received a call from a supervisor, after writing another review,  but not from the actual owner and my concern was never addressed even with the supervisor.  The worst part of this is that it happened during the pandemic and an extreme heat crisis.  My only concern was the safety of my family!  The only suggested method by the supervisor to make me happy was to return my money and remove the part.  How is that even a solution?  The supervisor then tried to upsell me a club membership plan. Ludicrous!  Talk about not being concerned about your customers and their satisfaction and only being concerned about your own company bottom line.  At the end of the day, I do not recommend this company for their terrible sales tactics and their potential price gouging and their lack of concern.  UPDATE: Just got a quote from another small company and I was overcharged by at least $100.  Be aware. UPDATE:  It’s heartbreaking to see your self glorifying response.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1598315450187, 'text': "Hi Roman! It's heartbreaking to see this review, after sending a technician to your home within 24 hours in the middle of the heat wave, and fixing your system the very next day. The price to fix it, its our price all year long and this was proven. We still offered you your money back since we have a 100% satisfaction guarantee and you declined. Also offered our club membership to save you 20% on the repair and was also declined.\nHave a bless day!"}</response>

< review>
Climate Care and its owner, Gerardo, are the best!  Gerardo and Oscar have worked on my system for over 10 years.  When Gerardo decided to create his own company, Climate Care, I knew I wanted to follow him (from is previous company) to his new business endeavor.  He and his entire staff are honest and make every effort to give excellent service and to resolve whatever issue I might have.

Oscar is wonderful.  He is very knowledgeable and efficient -- and has also provided me with over ten years of excellent service.  Cody is a newer member of Gerardo's team and has already shown me his eagerness to do his very best.

Gerardo's office staff are all a pleasure to work with.  Diana is delightful and has been truly helpful in the coordination of work to be done. The other office staff members are also very friendly and have shown a sincere desire to be of assistance.

I highly recommend Climate Care!</review>

Cody did a great job - not only doing what was required in the maintenance of the furnace but explained in detail the functions of the components of the unit. Cody was courteous, knowledgeable and excellent customer skills. Just a reminder to us customers - buy your disposable air filters ahead of time so that the tech can replace your old filters. Thank you Cody for making me feel very special!<//text>

Mr. Richard Samkas, Senior Tech., was friendly, courteous, and represented Climate Care in a positive light.  He arrived in a company vehicle wearing a clean uniform with his prestigious certifications on his sleeve. He portrayed a professional demeanor, explained his actions while answering questions without unnecessary jargon. He worked cleanly, thoroughly, and kept me informed. I support local businesses and enjoy contributing to our community. I highly recommend Climate Care--and especially Mr. Samkas. John and Irene<//review>

<Review>They are responsive but after I had my mini splits installed it was not even one year and the systems no longer worked properly. I called and 2 techs spent about 5-6 hours and eventually got it to work (Freon leak was what I was told Initially) techs are coming out again because we are having the same issue. Techs came out again and replaced both units due to the units being defective. The repairs have been made and everything seems to be working properly for now. The company is prompt and responsive.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The night before was particularly cold. I had problems with my heater blowing cold air some of the time and hot air most of the time. Well that night it gave up and dropped the house temperature. So I happened to see the Climate Care van the next morning driving by and flagged down, Richard Samkas, the Senior Service Technician , thankfully he pulled over and offered to call to Climate Care office and make me a appointment.  I let them know my situation and they sent him back that same day to repair my heater and I haven't had a problem since . Me and my family thank you for your fast and excellent service.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1589929455430, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback!'}< /Response>< Name>

Richard called me, told me when he was going to be here, and was.
He was a very personable individual that walked me through what he had tested.  He also discussed me, in a very informative but not pushy way,  about the availability and functionality of the new whole house fans.
Excellent rep for Climate Care.  I will ask if he is available the next time I need their services.< /review>

Charged my unit with a pound of refrigerant at no charge as advertised, with no gimmicks. Because of Chris’s honesty and professionalism I chose to purchase the annual service contract.

<Text>I am really impressed with this company and Sr. Technician, Richard Samkas. My AC was not blowing cool air and when I called to get a company I was referred to to come out, they were busy until tomorrow later in the day.  I needed my AC unit fixed today . Richard came out and was professional, kind and very knowledgeable.  I thought it needed  R-22, but he immediately found that was not the problem, that it was a capacitor. He had my AC going quickly and it’s working great as I write this review.  Thanks Richard for your great service!<//Text>< Date>

Got a brand new A/C from them. We’re already seeing our heating bills drop compared to our old A/C! The whole process from scheduling the initial inspection to getting the A/C installed was a breeze and took less than 72 hours. I would absolutely recommend Climate Care to friends and family!<//text>

Wow where do I start? My family and I are extremely happy with the hard work, over the top professionalism, and amazing install of our brand new Stealth Pro 5.5 Quiet Cool Whole House Fan that comes with a wireless remote and our Quiet Cool Smart Gable Fan that is Bluetooth comparable from the comfort of our own home controlled by my cell phone installed by Climate Cares lead installer Juan Garcia!

First and foremost if you don't have a Quiet Cool whole house fan installed in your home then I highly encourage and recommend you to call the very friendly staff at Climate Care to have a technician come out to get you set up with one in your home! Also the attic gable fan is a life saver of your AC constantly running by keeping your attic cooled off from all the heat build up throughout the hot summer months! I'm so amazed with the whole project I can carry the wireless remote around the house with me and control the Stealth Pro 5.5 three speed Quiet Cool whole house fan from the comfort of my own couch or bed! With the attic gable fan there's a quiet cool app that I downloaded in my App Store and I'm also able to control the attic smart gable fan from anywhere in the home just by simple going to my phone and programming it to my desired settings!

I was absolutely amazed with how fast the smart gable fan cooled off my attic it was 103° in my attic when the attic gable fan was installed and after 30 minutes of running it it dropped the temperature of my attic down to 83° which was a huge drop and a major heat load lifted off of my attic which contains the ductwork that my cool air travels through in the summer time to cool my home! It's a no brainer! Cooling off my attic will cool off the ductwork so cooler air coming from my AC will be supplied to the comfort of my home which means my utility bills will drop significantly saving me tons of money on utility costs! Thanks again Juan Garcia !!! You are one heck of a Rock Star in the field of heating and air install !!!!<//text>

Today I had RIchard Samkas (Senior Tech) come to my home late afternoon to give me a quote for a new HVAC system as we were in dire need. At thIs stage we were  going for our 3rd bid, and wow was he awesome!!  He had his ladder ready with a great big smile, climbed the attic to inspect our attic space, looked at both the condenser and furnace thoroughly while explaining in detail what kind of issues we were experiencing, and was just very professional overall! He will be the guy to diagnose any issues and is current on explaining the phase outs of R22 refrigerant that has been phased out since Jan 1st, 2020 by the EPA. Lastly he came out with the best price that my wife and I both agreed on. If you need someone to take care of your HVAC needs give this man a call and schedule it today..!</text>

<Review>We have had Climate Care for around 5 years! Most recent we have had Richard Samkas and Chris Hayes out to our home here in Modesto! We have always received a 5 Star service from Climate Cares office and technicians! we are currently on Climate Cares VIP club membership for annual heating and cooling tune ups! we had Senior Service tech Richard Samkas from Climate Care out today for a diagnostic. The batteries in our thermostat were accidently put in backwards by us and Richard caught it and explained that he will give a senior citizen Valentine's day discount and waived our diagnostic fee! Thank you so very much Richard for your love and care in taking good care of us today! I would highly recommend Senior Service Technicians Richard Samkas and Chris Hayes to all of my friends and family in need of any heating and air conditioning needs! thanks Climate Care you most definitely receive my 5 STAR REVIEW TODAY! Thanks for also having a team of office personnel and technicians trained to take good care of the elderly!!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Man, what can I say. The whole team at Climate Care is awesome! From the very first time reached out, the customer service has been nothing short of amazing. I've had a QuiteCool installed, which has been a life saver, and I just recently had Richard Samkas come out because I was having issues with my AC unit. To say the least, Richard got it up and running in no time all while having some good conversation! I will definitely be using Climate Care for ALL if my heating and cooling needs! Go Cavs!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Had a ruud outside unit installed in january because my compressor went out in the old one. Richard samkiss was very personable and went out of his way to get me all the discounts available, and worked real hard to try to get me financing due to my bad credit. He had the unit installed the very next day and it only took about 3.5 hrs.< /Text>

<Text>I usually never write reviews or anything of this sort, but I created this account today for this reason. I was searching online for an AC company online. Climate Care was my second choice due to 4 stars not 5 like Airway Heating. I liked their website and they had a nice deal on ac service. I say what the heck and give them a call. Little did I know I was headed towards a migraine. We schedule an appointment, I made it clear that me nor my wife would be home and my mother in law would due to the fact that I work 6 to 7 days a week. I get a call at work saying the tech will be late and that they are sorry. That's nothing and I say no problem. The technician shows up and questions why the owner isn't home and says he cannot work or inspect anything. They call me at work and says he cannot do anything but he will let me know after he calls the office. I get a call later from my mother in law saying the tech left but LEFT BEHIND THE BILL TO BE PAID. Now I call the office and i'm pretty upset at this point. They reassure me that I wont have to pay and if I would like to reschedule. I decline the offer in a rude way, but 30 minutes later I feel bad and give them a call. I reschedule for the next week on a day I know my wife will be home so we have no problems. PERFECT, NO ONE SHOWS UP AT ALL AND WE GET NO CALL NOTHING. Very unprofessional, I recommend Airway Heating they will actually show up.

No I do not wan't to make the situation better, I don't want the owner responding to this post. I already got the run around for a few days to "make things better" my wife's day got wasted as well. This is to inform people that even though they have a great ac service add, they only care if you are home so they can up sell he most they can.

P.S- I probably would have paid for everything the tech would have recommended without even thinking twice. I just wanted my AC to be good for the rest of the year.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>I was able to witness Senior Technician Richard Samakas, from Climate Care, in action during a promotional Furnace Tune-Up. He is a professional, credentialled, personable and thorough Technician.

You'll feel like you're back in France ordering your baguette at this local gem. It's a must try! Their selection may be limited, but coming here to select your freshly baked and still warm from the (ceiling high) oven loaf of bread, to then watch them slice it right in front of you, is what I call a religious experience.< /text>

Great bread! Really poor customer service. I preordered dinner rolls for a dinner party. Went to pick them up and they did not have them. No phone call in advance, their excuse was that they had a problem. They totally dropped the ball. They are not dependable or respectful of their customers. I’m looking for a new bakery.<//text>

I got their right at 7am when they first opened and the breads were still in the oven baking. Not a huge deal but I did have to wait a few minutes and they couldn't slice it for me it needed to cool for at least 45 minutes before that was a possibility I was told. But what they lacked in efficienct service they made up for with delicious bread. The Lemon Rosemary was amazing.</Text>

These people are passionate about their bread.  Small bakery, kind of hard to find, but worth the trip.  Clean and neat.  Nice people. Great bread.  My first time here, but won't be my last.</text>

<text>Simply incredible bread sold here. I appreciate that they let you sample the bread. The bread is so fresh here, I could almost eat a whole loaf by myself. The staff will slice your bread for you on the spot, so take advantage of that if you want! I am surprised this bakery is not more well known online.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Fabulous!  If you want  Sourdough bread truly made as it was intended, a 3 day process, this is the place! I've been around to the other places in town they don't do it  by hand like they do at  The rustic loaf  and it shows.</Text>< resp>

<Text>You should advertise on here that you are cash only. In this age of technology you should at least have a square. The taco truck at my construction jobsites have a card reader you could at least get one to accommodate this age of technology.

As always the food is great. But the service is just not there. I have been a long turm customer, since Bartolo was there. He made you feel welcome and appreciated. That is not so now. It seems like these people are their against their will, and make you feel like they can't get rid of you soon enough.</text>

<Text>Dear Lord this is hands down, THE best carnitas I've ever had in my life! Visiting from Flagstaff AZ, had no idea we'd run into a place like this being as our host introduced us to the owners. Gracias hosts! Lovely, friendly people. We're Native American so we don't know a whole lot of Spanish but that didn't duo then from being ever so diplomatic. Amazing!<//Text>< Pictures>

The best authentic Mexican carnitas in the Bay Area. They have all meat or mixed which means you get most of the other non meat items which are very tasty. The salsa is amazing on the carnitas. They also have fabulous chicharrón thick and thin and great nopales. Take a bag of carnitas to go or eat inside.  Simply the best!< /Review>

Great tasting carnitas on weekends only expect a line of people waiting to be served or take it to go which seems more popular. Best deal is a pound of carnitas with rice and beans and green tomatillo sauce.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>The  Carnitas are the best anywhere! The owner uses special spices from Mexico to give it this great flavor! The rest of the food is good also the steak meat has great flavor and my grandson is real picky for his steak burritos and he loves their steak meat( carne asada) they're only open Friday Saturday and Sunday so if you don't get there by 1 o'clock you might be out of luck on the pork meat(carnitas). Wish they were open a little more days in service is a little slow but the owner tries his best!</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Always the same, Friday disks open at 10, it was 10:18 and they did not open, on Saturday disks open at 9:20 and it was my turn to be 9:20 and they have not opened, Only for fame and that they are rich, Do not take advantage and be clear in their timeless. Nothing is eternal in this life.

(Original)
Siempre lo mismo,Viernes disque abren a las 10,eran las 10:18 y no abrían,los sábado disque abren a las 9 y me ha tocado que sean 9:20 y no han abierto, Solo por la fama y que están ricas, no se aprovechen y sean claros en sus  es eternohorarios. Nada es eterno  en esta vida.😠🤬< /review>

<review>I admire this spot! They provide tasty dishes, they have a rich menu, The chef in that restaurant is an expert, I enjoy a lot tasting all their food. The food is consistently fresh and tasty, the service towards the visitors  is agreeable. I often go to  this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it with no hesitation.< /review>< pictures>

Great food and not too pricey. Love the Wednesday $1 pupusa deal that they have. I just despise their waiting time. They serve you your food almost after 30-40mins. I always order ahead whether I'm picking up or eating in.</Review>

<Text>Came here with two friends on a Wednesday morning. We all agreed the food was so so. The tv was waaay too loud and nobody was watching it. The younger waitress with too much blush, was incredibly rude. I asked her for the check and first she ignored me, the second time she didn’t even bother to look at me but mumbled “hmm mm” as she walked away. I guess for some people it’s just hard to be friendly and smile. I don’t like bad customer service so I will not be going back!<//Text>< Pics>

I've been coming here every now and then. Their food is good, but they lack quantity in food they put in, like, they only put 2 eggs when ordering to go! That isn't enough for a $7 breakfast! They had great people working herr at one point, but they suddenly disappeared and were replaced by random, unfriendly people that seem to have an attitude. Not to mention when I went to pick up my food, they forgot my drink and when they gave it to me, they didn't asked mr what kind of drink I wanted! The girl just poured it without asking me what i wanted. They don't speak at all or say "I'll be with you in a moment" nor anything for good manners! They really need to get their workers straight!</Review>

<Review>This restaurant definitely needs better management or a supervisor that knows what customer service is. Every single time we decide to give them another chance, it seems that their customer service has worsen. I can see why there is a rotation of workers through that restaurant. Not only are the women there rude and have attitudes, but they seem to not even care whether or not they are taking the order correctly. For example, in the past we have ordered a "pan con gallina" & the woman who worked there perviously, made it perfectly fine. Today when we ordered this same dish... 1. They wrote the wrong name & then tried to argue with me that I said my own name wrong. (Why in the world would I say MY own name wrong? It's MY name) 2. The woman has the audacity to argue with me about it when honestly it wasn't a big deal (just give me my food so I can get out of here). 3. It's as if they purposelly gave me the oldest, stalest bread they had & literally stuffed two chicken legs in it. They did not even try to shread the chicken and add the ingredients the way it should be. 4. When I asked if they could give me the sandwich WITHOUT bones, the woman stubbornly said "it does not come with bone", well that's not how my meal came. I really hope that their management team actually reads these reviews because based on many more that I've read, I'm.not the only customer having issues here.</Review><userid>102465834299215109691</userid><user_name>Gabriela Esparza< /user_name><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b80d3cd6b687:0x945fbde68729bd7a</gmap_id>< Rate>

The food was ok but it was a lucky thing I spoke a bit if spanish because all, I mean all of the workers don't speak NO english. Don't get me wrong I love spanish people and food but I seen how other people that came in as I dined in could not commumicate with them because if this problem. I feel it will cut their money short what this place could have made because of the communication barrier.<//review>

Legumes and hard bananas. I called them to tell them it was the problem and they told me that the manager was not there. Talk to cosinera vilma, she asked me in a very good way if we wanted the money to be returned to us or if we wanted the food to be made again, we prefer that they return the money when my children arrived, they were attended by a very disgusting woman who told them to never order of this restaurant because the owner is losing money is no way to treat a customer he said that we just wanted to eat for free. Always be very careful when ordering food from this place. My son spent over $ 60 and everything was rotten. It is very bad that she can trust us in this way the owner has to have a better attitude with the clients (pink) be careful with this place

Este lugar es uno de los peores restaurantes en Los Angeles ahora mi hijo ordenó 16 Pupusas 10 de queso y 6 de frijoles con queso primera mente las Pupusas estaban agrias y duras. Los plátanos lígosos y duros. Les llame para decirles que era el problema me dijeron que no estaba el manager. Able con la cosinera vilma me pregunto en muy buena manera si queríamos que nos regresara el dinero o que si queríamos que nos hisiera la comida de nuevo prefirimos que nos regresarán el dinero cuando mis hijos llegaron los atendió una mujer muy repugnante les dijo que nunca ordenáramos de este restaurante porque el dueño está perdiendo el dinero está no es manera de tratar a un cliente dijo que nosotros nomas queríamos comer de gratis. Siempre que ordenen comida de este lugar tengan mucho cuidado. Mi hijo gastó más de 60 dólares y todo estaba podrido. Esta muy mal que ella nos able de esta manera la dueña tiene que tener mejor actitud con los clientes (rosa) cuidado con este lugar< /text>< pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It's too expensive to say it worthy ... the rice is too salty, the beans are burned you can taste it, the salad is not fresh. The only thing I like is that they use low oil.
It is very expensive to say that it is worth it ... the rice is in balance, the fried beans are burned, it is felt after trying them and the salad is not fresh. The only thing that is respected is that their food has low fat

Es muy caro para decir que vale la pena... el arroz esta saldo, los frijoles fritos estan quemados, se siente luego al probarlos y la ensalada no es fresca.

I ordered bean pupusas with cheese and loroco and the waitress gave me pure cheese with loroco and All ill-mannered said they could not change them when the error was her because that was not what I ordered!

(Translated by Google) They know how to make rice pupusas my favorite, what I don't think are the prices for an horchata and 2 pupusas 10.50 is too much money for so little.
Also notice that some tables are uneven (limp) that gives bad appearance. Also look at a tiny cockroach on the wall they should pay more attention to the cleanliness of that place.

(Original)
Saben hacer las pupusas mis favoritas las de arroz, lo que no me parece son los precios por una horchata y 2 pupusas 10.50 es demasiado dinero por tan poco.
Tambien note que algunas mesas estan desniveladas (cojean) eso da mal aspecto. También mire una cucaracha pequeñita en la pared deberian de poner mas atención al aseo de ese local.</review>

(Translated by Google) I give them three stars for the taste of the food because the customer service is pity when I arrived I had to repeat my order three times for the person to understand. My order was for take-out; after FOURTY MINUTES I approached the counter to ask first they told me that I was not ready afterwards and they bring it but it is incomplete, which is why I demanded my money back and retired logically upset.
They need to give these people proper training.

(Original)
Les doy tres estrellas por el sabor de la comida porque el servicio al cliente  es pesimo cuando llegue tuve que repetir mi orden tres veces para que la persona entendiera . Mi orden  era  para llevar ;al cabo de CUARENTA MINUTOS  me acerque al mostrador  a preguntar primero me dijeron que no estaba lista depues y la traen pero viene incompleta, rszon por la cual exigi  mi dinero de regreso y me retire logico molesto.
Es necesario que les den el debido entrenamiento a estas personas .</Text>

Great experience! So thankful Laura was able to sort through three years of my life to get me caught up on my taxes. Larry runs a very professional business. The team is super responsive and quickly filed my returns without too many questions. Will definitely return next year!<//text>

It's my first time using this tax service and it was a very nice experience all things considered. Medy was especially knowledgeable and goes that extra mile to assist with the filing process . But I will add don't file too early as you may have documents  received after having filed taxes and require you to do an amendment to your original filing, costing between $75&$100. But Larry was a Very nice  said he would try to do it for $50.Turns out I didn't need to.  I  would recommend this place to my friends in the future . Thanks guys  . See you all next time ...

<resp>None< /resp><review>It was my third year filing as a corporation and the first two years I had gone somewhere else, regrettably. I was not looking forward to getting my taxes done again, but Liberty Tax Service took away all of my worries the moment I stepped in the door. They didn't see my lack of experience at filing corporate taxes as an eyeroll moment like others had, they understood my specific needs, tended to every question and concern I had, and handled everything in a timely manner and with respect for me the whole way through. Their follow-up is admirable because if it were up to me I'd go back to hiding from my taxes until they were past due again. They don't pester, they professionally prod, when it's time to file again.

I highly recommend giving them a try for your first or fiftieth time if your existing tax preparers don't have time for your questions or make you feel like it's you against them like my past ones did. Liberty Tax Service makes you feel, and delivers, as if you're all on the same team!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2907f485d8c45:0x9316ccee5d3f7449</Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><userid>110688226596057530592</userid></record></dataset><record>

<review>I dropped off my information.  Covid protocols were in place.  I missed an email question so was called on a few points.  I came in when everything was ready for e-sign.  Temperature, health questions, plexiglass, masks all around, hand sanitizers.  I felt very safe.  And if course, happy to have an efficient tax preparer to take care of business.< /review><user_name>Karen Skinner</user_name>< Response>

<review>Last year was the second time my family’s used Liberty Tax in GH.  The first time,  my husband was alive and Larry did an excellent job with our returns.
They were way bigger then we thought they’d be. So, after my husband died last September, I decided to dry up my tears and head on over again. However, I was scared. It’d been 20 years since I’d done my taxes alone.

I can’t tell you how ECSTATIC I was that I met with Larry again. My children and I had been living on my husband’s Social Security Benefits . Now, I was being assaulted every time I got the mail.  They  kept warning me that they may tax every penny of those benefits I received.

Gratefully, after what seemed like only a mere  40 minutes sitting In Granada Hills with Larry at Liberty Tax. My kids and I walked away with  a couple of $2,000 checks, a $900 one, and the Federal...well it was $8,000!!!

I feel less alone and overwhelmed each day now!   That’s only because I surround myself with amazing people. Human Beings who don’t drain me.  Instead, they  add plenty of positivity and hope... like Larry.</review><time>1603523318729< /time>< gmap_id>

I was extremely impressed with the quality of service and care we experienced during our tax appointment with this company. The open, friendly nature of the proprietor and staff was evident. We were greeted warmly, began our appointment immediately upon arrival and pleased at the level of care and knowledge imparted. Ms. Fernandez demonstrates her level of tax preparedness leadership completely. Her abilities and efficiency was evident throughout!  We will utilize this service many times in the future.

Another year of great taxes preparation with Medy at Liberty tax in  North Hills. She is passionate about her work and will ask all the possible questions to give you the best refund.  Larry (the owner) always greet you with a huge smile.  He is such a gentlemen and has an incomparable business approach.  GO CHECK THEM OUT!!! You will be happy you did.<//Text>

Laura and Medy are amazing. They made sure that I received every deduction and credit that was available for me. They took the time ask me questions that insured that I would be getting the maximum refund without any trouble.  My tax return was very complicated but they made my experience quick and painless. I am so glad I decided to switch to Liberty Tax. I will definitely be back next year!</review>

<text>We come back to Liberty Tax in Granada Hills every year. They take such great care of us we would never go anywhere else. I am especially grateful for the time Jessenia and Dayna spent with us this year because we needed much more care with the new tax changes. I can’t thank them enough for making it work for us so we wouldn’t owe anything. Thank you all so much. Larry too. 😊<//text></record>

It was truly a pleasure having Medy and Larry prepare my 2017 taxes.  I had just changed over to Liberty Tax and I must say I felt quite comfortable and confident my tax return was prepared correctly. Will return again and highly recommended.
Thank you Liberty Tax!

Liberty Tax Service in Granada Hills has earned my highest recommendation for their outstanding professionalism in filing my tax returns.  I have been a customer for many years and will continue to work with them, because they make the process simple while achieving the best results for me.

My 2018 is done by Amita Tambusaria and as always....she has done a fabulous job!!  I highly recommend her service!<//text>

I’ve been going to Liberty Tax for the past 2 years and each year the customer service remains the same ..AMAZING. Larry is always so eager to help and is very helpful with scheduling and also flexiable. Walking in and right away you’re greeted with a smile. Every person there is so helpful with any questions you have. This year I was helped by Aminta and she was so sweet and quick. She had me out in less than 30 mins. As always Liberty tax comes with their A game. Will be back for future years to come.< /Review>

Give this place a shot, great team!  While I was there, Larry, Medy and Laura were extremely friendly, helpful and professional.  I had 4 years worth of taxes that I needed help filing.  I had a bunch of questions about my situation and what I could count as a deduction.  Medy listened to my scenario and gave me her feedback, then followed up with some quick research and quoted me the answer.  Which confirmed her initial response in more detail.  I absolutely appreciate that level of dedication.  It reassured me that I was in good hands and I feel relieved that paperwork will be clean and worry free. Thank you Larry and Medy! I cannot thank you enough! Larry I am extremely grateful for the assistance in getting my tax issues resolved - all of it!

I would suggest making an appointment to ensure you have a quick visit. I was fortunate to arrive during a slow period. It's located right next to Smart and Final, making it very easy to find.  The parking lot does have traffic, but I always manage to find several open spaces.  On a side note, they also have snacks and beverages... it's a little thing, but it's an indication that they put forth a legitimate effort to try to ensure you have a pleasant experience with them.  They'll most likely provide you with flyer of other services that they provide (bookkeeping, accounting, copying, etc.).  They may apply to you and your state of affairs; me, not so much.  I'm sure that you'll receive a copy when you stop by.</Review>

I live in Bakersfield and this is a spot I have to hit every time I'm in the area. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food is absolutely amazing. A little on the pricey side but well worth what you pay. You get a lot for your money. Me and the family usually have enough food to save after eating for a second meal the next day. I really wish there was one where I live.< /text>

I’m not gonna go on and on about the food. We all know how well known they are for there steaks and drinks. I’m posting this to show my appreciation for Rachel our waiter. Outstanding service very helpful and friendly. Best service by far in a long time. Ask for Rachel and your experience will go beyond just great eats! She was phenomenal at her job and her personality went hand in hand with her customer service skills.< /text>

Overall it's alright. Went there for lunch. It was definitely pretty good food and filling.

Service was good taking into account it was 7 of us. It took a while for our food to be prepared,  but taking everything into account with Covid, it was understandable. Ordered the steak salad and it was expensive but very large portion. Didn't have much steak and ended up with 2 big pieces of gristle but I didn't bring it to their attention. It was still an enjoyable salad.<//text>

<Review>The tables were staggered so to be designed for self isolation seating. Very efficient, clean, safe, and a great selection of delicious entrees. Especially the meat dishes and beef soups. I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch meal there mid week. It was quiet and relaxing to eat out again. I will be back with local friends to share the fine food and service.< /Review></record>

The Experience wasn't so bad as waiting for a table when you could see 15 to 20 of them outside nobody sitting at them. Then I asked for the heater to be turned on and it took five times before someone finally did. The young man who did turn the heater on was amazing and continue to come back and asked us if we needed anything. We ordered our orders first or appetizers I should say they were delicious we were very happy with what we got. However we then ordered the steak and bread because the orders had filled us up so much. It was ordered medium rare and we got it extra well done. Since I absolutely cannot enjoy anything that is that well-cooked I let them know told them I was kind of in a hurry because we have another place to go to they told me they could remake it in about 8 minutes. We waited and unfortunately this time it came back a little bit medium and instead of saying anything I just paid for our meal and I gave it to my dogs. It was rather tough. When the staff would spot us and see that I was trying to get their attention they were very responsive which was nice like I say the young man I believe his name was Jacob was extremely on it. Picking up dishes that were empty glasses that were empty asking if I want it more coffee excetera. So there were enough waitresses to handle the outside area it just seemed like it took a while to get them back to the table. This is a rough time for everybody so I would actually have give this three and a half Stars.</Text>

But I really want to give a shout-out to our wonderful server Shelley. She and her team took awesome care of us.

Also the hostess crew were great. Their estimate of the 45-min wait was spot on. And I do like that I was sent an SMS text rather than having to rely on a light-up puck. This allowed me to go do a little shopping during the wait.</Review><userid>111790775786220264389< /userid><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Ordered take out. BEWARE. Food was cold and not good at all. Steak was hard and cold. Gave us smaller portions than usual. We ordered through door dash pick up AND EVERYTHING WAS $8 extra.  Cool Hand Lukes wouldn’t answer their phone so we went on their website to order food and directed us to door dash. We have complained through door dash as well. But it isn’t doordash’s problem because we personally had to go pick up the food. Overall bad experience. Definitely won’t be ordering again.< /Text>

Cool Hand Luke's is open with a very nice patio setup. They have tents set up so there is plenty of shade. The menu has all of your favorites. I had prime rib- yum! The beef cut like butter and the seasoning gave a satisfying crunch. I also enjoyed my sailed and baked potato. I finished with the cookie sundae. Staff was nice and friendly.< /Review>

Meat was raw, and food was sup par, i may have gotten a bad chef, but asking 33 for a migon and getting it purple was pretty unpleasant, call yourselves the “coolest joint in town” yet cant cook a steak? Wish the food was as good as the service</Review>

Had dinner here twice during our road trip. In the restaurant the first night and in the salloon the second. Wife ordered the sr3eak house Cobb which was absolutely huge while I had the New York steak. Came with rolls, beans, and a salad. A lot of food. The second night we both had tri-tip. Hers was fine, mine was cold.<//text>

Outdoor dinning in the middle of a pandemic was a breath of fresh air, literally. Polite staff. The chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes tasted like a home cooked comfort meal. I was not a fan of the blooming onion appetizer, but horseradish is an acquired taste. To each their own, the only reason I removed a star. Will definitely be a returning customer.</review>

<review>Update... Still love it here!!!
Party of 3, sat at the bar. Place seems extremely loud but it's a bar. Waitress was great with her service. We ordered drinks and apps. Ordered the chardonnay,  rum and coke, vodka and soda, the bacon wrapped shrimp, the steak and mushrooms, fried artichokes, and the nachos. The food was warm and delicious. We frequent CHL after work to wind down and have never been disappointed! Thank you for great food and great service.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbl_88LHh3GXB7Y9qQrEntmX-pzbJ7vPSzk3I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGdD4sWRz-XVk3qzigKwxiAUSQxqUlCAj93gg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy4v5k_s9Ce2Ebs8sWBXnTb8uZs04SglhLrNA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPT85QFZ7gU0V0Iw-lIZCKj1rBV0DsbG9Gg4Pg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>{'time': 1539646533946, 'text': "Thanks for coming to see us, Belinda!

I was very impressed  by  the  way  that  this place was set up to accommodate diners during this difficult  time. I realize that they have mor space them some  other restaurants,  But they did make the outdoor area very comfortable,  there was even a TV. As for the food it was excellent and very plentiful.  My prime rib sandwich was loaded with meat and my friend's  steak house cobb was beautifully  prepared and it appeared freshly made. Our waitress Denise was very prompt  with our order and you could tell that she took pride in doing  her job. We went to a local restaurant  recently  were we had to ask for everything .  I want to support our local businesses during these times but sometimes  have not received  such a great service as we did here.< /review>

Had dinner with my family here on Father's Day and it was delicious as always. The service was amazing, our server Megan was the nicest person we encountered that day. I was translating the menu for my husband and I thought it was so awesome that Megan took it upon herself to talk to my husband directly in Spanish, even though it was obvious her 1st language is English. She could have let me continue to talk for my husband but she chose to go above and beyond and speak directly to him in Spanish, she's amazing. Thanks Megan!<//text>

< Review>
Ordered for pick up, not satisfied... i ordered steak bites & side Cesar salad, simple right? Wrong because it was to go the quality & quantity was definitly not worth the little over $20 i paid. I ordered medium on steak bites & they were well done plus there was more mushrooms then steak, ceasar salad was this small box. Plus when i was 1st given the bagged order i noticed how light the bag was , they had forgotten the ceasar salad. Had to wait for the ceasar salad while the steak/ muchrooms were getting cold. And there were no napkins or utensils in the bag.  So overall not something I'll be doing again. Service was not great either, 1st person i told about the missing item walked away & didn't come back.<//Review>

2nd time here & it is always so favorable 😍 this time I had a steak, ribs, & steak fries plate everything was yummy 😭 I fell in love with this place already.
& there strawberry lemonade 😍💕 no words to describe!!
Both of the times we went at night && had the same waitress we love her 💙 she made us feel at home & comfortable eating there. She is soooo friendly & nice. It looks like she enjoys her job 😁 alot!! I forgot her name but next time I'll make sure to get it to give her props on here  she is awesome.
But yeah I will 1000% recommend this place for sure☺</text>

We were ignored! A waitress and a waiter walked by us and never acknowledged us.  Others were asked what they wanted to drink and we were left without being asked.</review>

<text>Friendly staff and a fun environment, but the prices are a bit steep for what it is and sometimes the food isn't that great. I've had company that has either had hit-and-miss food or some that have just had downright bad luck. I've usually had good luck so I like the food!</text>< Resp>

<Text>Right across the parking lot from a wine tasting room we went was Cool Hand Luke's BBQ. We went with a rather large group of people, so ordering was minorly chaotic. But our hostess did a fine job keeping everyone's order straight. Kudos to her. The dry rub ribs I ordered was quite delicious except a bit salty. Tri tip sandwich was definitely tasty. The steak with artichoke alfredo, can only comment on the alfredo, but that was pretty solid as well.< /Text>< Pics>

I want to like this place! Cool place, nice atmosphere, great easy location. Service was good. But I have been twice in the last 3 months and the food is just okay. Prime rib, ehh. It was so so! Salmon, I've had better. Coconut shrimp, I know your not a fish joint but please! Clam chowder, could you possibly add a clam? More appropriately called potato chowder. Sides, could somebody add some seasoning! I don't think I'll be back.< /review>

<text>Service was bad, food was bad. I expected more. My wife and I ordered the nightly surf and turf special. The lobster was good but the prime rib was like shoe leather. We asked for med rare and got well done, we also asked for mushrooms on top of the prime rib which they forgot. When I asked  the waiter she was rude and nasty and said it was extra. I  said it was part of the order. (Different waitress) She came back with a bowl of mushrooms, which she plopped on the table unceremoniously.

I have never complained about any food I have ordered before, but this was just to much for $105.00. I should have talk to the manager but it was late and I was to mad to talk to him right then. "Beware"</text>< user_id>

Sitting outside in the chilly air, our heater shut down due to empty propane. They had no more propane! What!?. Food was low level and laced with sodium. This place isn't cheap either.</review>

< Review>
Just went there yesterday, June 21st 2019 and our experience was fantastic. Our server was very polite and attentive yet gave his privacy and left us alone most of the time. When I asked another employee if he would change out our soup which was too salty for the clam chowder, he was very courteous and immediately brought us back a different type of soup that was more suitable for our taste. I also asked this other employee if he could bring us some extra bread and without hesitation brought us another basket of bread.
This is the type of service that will not break the bank of any restaurant yet goes a tremendously long way. Amazing that some places don't practice by this type of standard. But this restaurant Cool Hand Luke knows how to treat its customers hands down.
I'm generally not a big tipper, but our waitress earned her almost $10 tip by giving us an overall great experience for a lunch while we were out of town on vacation returning home.
I would definitely visit again when traveling through Santa Maria in the future<//Review>

I like this place, servers are always friendly and tri tip sandwich you can't go wrong with, maybe an onion blossom also! The iced tea in a mason jar is a nice touch to!I had lunch there 2 weeks ago.  The food was great and the service was too.  I was checking it out for a group of us.  It's thumbs down for the group because the music was ridiculously loud.< /text>

<review>Great food!
Pretty ok prices!
Waiter was good and by quite a bit to check on us. I spent 90 to feed my family of 6. We ended up ordering too much and left with take home food.
I love the environment. Mason jar drinks made me think of my grandpa's house.

The only negatives:
Slight mistake on the order but fixed quickly.
The sauce for the blooming onion was a little watery.

I would definitely recommend it and would go back.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Service was consistently good, the beans were great. I normally don't like stews, but I tried their beef stew and it was incredibly good and homemade.

I had their Cowboy Ribeye and it was flavorful. The baked potato was good and I had something called a Strawberry Pizza which was a thin piece of shortbread with fresh strawberries and cream and it was wonderful.</text>

I came in yesterday with my friends and we were attended so great by one of the waitresses, I don’t remember his name but it was a young gentle man with a little beard I think, he gave great service and even though they had no filet he went to ask what we can do and made sure I was satisfied ! The food was so delicious when it got to our table, it was so fast, I highly recommend!! Definitely coming back when we come on vacation again<//review>

<review>Great steak, fun atmosphere, cute waitresses in western jeans. I enjoyed the trip-tip and my wife always gets the flank steak. It's been awhile since we've there so the menu may have changed, but if not then that's we'll have again next time. Oh, then there's the bar where you can start your drinking while you wait for a table.

This place was my personal favorite restaurant in Santa Maria until they went fully corporate. Since that happened business has fallen dramatically. Doesnt have the same feel as it used to. The menu went on a diet as well, removing my favorite item, lobster mac and cheese. Used to be a real treat. Prices haven't changed though.</Review>

<review>First off, the bar was amazing and the service was great. Having one extra server in there one Sunday game day would help. But overall it was a good time. The reason for three stars is the the table prep for the dinner I was having.

Went there for a family gathering and was say at a large table. Put my wallet and phone down on the end of the table, only to find when I picked it up it was sticky & slimy. Nothing was applied on the table and nothing was near it. Just gave me the idea that they do a quick wipe down with the same dirty yeah they use everywhere.

The food, came out quick and everyone was okay with it. But the table was a real let down.< /review>< date>

Unfortunately a poor experience this week at CHL.
Seated 10 minutes late, even with a reservation.
Steak ordered medium well and came out rare.
Ribs came out luke warm (mind the pun) and were just edible. Credit to management for handling the situation well however this still ruined the dining experience. The wifey did say the roast potato was especially good however pity it wasn’t with her main meal (steak).<//Review>

<review>I love Cool Hand Luke's , but this one is off.  Everything was very oily.  Disappointed because I had to give all the leftovers to the dogs.  The salad dressing was watery.  My daughter sent her meal back because it was too peppery.  The waiter was rude.  I won't be back.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>We have dinner at Cool Hand Luke's almost every time I visit my Grandpa. I really like the old west vibe they have going on. It's a rather spacious restaurant so there's rarely a time they can't immediately accommodate a party of four. More than that and you should make a reservation, but the back room easily handled our party of fifteen.

The food is hearty. I had a 9oz New York strip last night and it was seasoned to perfection. I had a side of mashed potatoes which left the plate looking a little colorless, but that's my fault. I should have gone with the mixed veggies.

Their drink menu is eclectic and has quite a few strong mixed punches for the connoisseur of brightly colored sweet cocktails that will knock you on your ass. Think long island but blue, pink or whatever.

The tap list is pretty good and the happy hour bar is welcoming. Getting across College Ave is a bit of a pain during rush hour if you're coming from the 101 south, but other than that there's not any logistical issues.< /Review><user>106801717568154343538< /user>< response>

I'm a local who has eaten there twice. The food is absolutely disgusting. We had a baby reveal with 16 people. NOBODY had anything positive to say about the food. To the contrary, the portions were small, much of the food was cold or undercooked, and overpriced. On my first trip, I ordered seafood that was rancid. However, the service was polite. For your own health and safety, please do not eat there.< /Review>

I ordered to petite bacon-wrapped filets, medium rare. They came out to me medium well. They brought me to new steaks which tasted bland and they had a gray pallor.and one of the steaks, I found a rather large wooden skewer that was broken off in the steak, I was lucky I didn't bite into it. The whiskey peppercorn sauce that was supposed to come with the steaks, had more of a consistency of a lumpy gravy and tasted only of salt. The bloomin Onion that we ordered as an appetizer, was lukewarm to say the least and not crunchy at all. We also noticed, that the appetizer came out very quickly, as if it had already been made and was sitting there on a counter somewhere in the kitchen. The coffee that my friend ordered was bitter and I could tell that it was old coffee. Don't waste your time or money coming to this place. Well Cool hand Luke's in Santa Maria used to be very good, it has definitely gone downhill.< /Review>

If you love terrible customer service, food quality, and paying to much for so little in return I recommend this hell hole. The lightning is dim. The Menu is small and ambiguous, not to mention false advertising. The host brought us different drinks and got our orders wrong then had the audacity to blame us for not reminding him. We walked out and didn't pay or touch our food. I hope it closes down soon for humanity sake.< /review>

Definitely a Western atmosphere.  With country music as background. We had prime rib and I added the coconut shrimp. You could make a meal of their cowboy stew alone. I brought it home. Service was good with minimal wait. Will go back again for a special meal. Above my budget for everyday.</Text>

Good service and food taste fine. For the bad  my prime rib was way overdone. The worst part about it was I've been sick ever since the night of the meal Thursday and it's Sunday today. I've had stomach problems food poisoning I'm guessing. I don't usually write reviews but it was my first time and definitely my last. I would never recommend it to someone else.</text>

Would have given it 4.5 stars if I could. I had the Whiskey Skillet steak with Bleu cheese added and a side of calamari and beef stew. The steak and stew were absolutely excellent; the calamari very good. The steak was ordered medium rare, but was cooked slightly closer to medium. Still excellent. Calamari was a tad on the chewy side, but definitely better than most. The whiskey sauce was served on the side as it should be, not on the steak and it was delicious. Service was prompt and attentive, but not overbearing. All in all, I give the steak a recommended must have, and the calamari recommended.</Review>

Phenomenal chow!! Nice setting and all around cool crowd. Kinda dark in there, so you get the Godfather vibe. Other than that it's a really nice venue.<//review>

<Text>Only average overall. Ordered Lukes western ribeye with the green beans and salad. Asked for medium rare, came medium well, very little pink at all. Somewhat tough and grissely on the cut.
The sauteed nushrooms and roasted garlic were excellent but not enough so to make up for the steak I only ate 1/2 of. Green beans side was also excellent, possibly sauteed in the mushroom butter. And the salad was only average, with watered down bleu cheese dressing.
Service was acceptable but not extra attentive, and since when does a restaurant not provide silverware by default? We had to ask for every piece of silverware individually.
Sad to say that even though the vegetables were great, I probably will not go back, and will choose the local non-franchise steak house instead.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Steaks!!! Don't go to the road house, same price but so much better!
Food was all excellent and a good value for the price.
Service was awesome.
Atmosphere was good. Clean. Comfortable.

The bad:
Got flat ginger ale with my cocktail and the alcohol ratio was a bit low. Come on bartender, you know when something doesn't have the fizz!</review>< Pics>

<Review>Great Hot Fudge Sundaes, good burgers, and open till 11 PM on weekends...what is there not to like?  One of the few places within
until SLO proper that has late proper eats.  In many ways, it is better
than downtown SLO since it is not packed with College kids.
It is also ideal for the traveler as a pit-stop.  Service is friendly & the
prices are far.  The Rib steaks & burgers are quite good.  It is one
of the better chains.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>We've been here three times and have left very satisfied after all three meals. Yes, it IS pricier than McDonald's or In & Out Burger, and that is because this is a top-notch steakhouse. Your steak is cooked to order, your fish is perfectly flaked, your calimari isn't too chewy or underdone. The lettuce in the salad could be fresher, but because of the amount that they serve daily, that would be impossible--they have to use bagged lettuce, like most every other restaurant. The beans you get to start your meal are hot and seasoned perfectly, as is your steak, chicken or fish, or even your burger (if that's how you roll.) We have not made it to dessert, not because it probably isn't great, like everything else, but just because we don't have room for it. We don't drink alcohol, but the tea is always fresh and the Coke is never flat or too carbonated. Hands down, my favorite place to eat a T-bone in central California.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80ec6c95c9a5f0f1:0x1120ddd35e4cdeff</GmapID></record>

I ordered a beef dip sandwich. Instead of thin sliced It was thick slabs with so much gristle it was impossible to eat.  Please tell your servers how to be pleasant, without being so phony and insincere as to be ridiculous.<//Text>

<text>The few times I have eaten here,  the steaks have been cooked perfectly (New York prime) and for the price you get a great deal. Anyone grading this place low due to price are likely those that eat the McDonalds value meal. Cool Hand Lukes in Santa Maria is worth the price of admission.<//text>< Date>

<review>You can tell the chicken wings are frozen from a freezer they have been pre-coated the calamari is not fresh you can tell all the prime rib is made earlier in the day kept in a warmer and all the steak is either previously frozen like a tomahawk steak and all the meat they use for their nachos is previously cooked like steak from the night before all the lettuce is pre-packaged all the food is pre cooked and the prime rib is just warmed to your liking you can tell the tri-tip is cooked earlier in the day not fresh at all the chef there is need to take more pride in their cooking the side dishes are pre-made beware of eating there not worth the money there a better steak houses here on the Central Coast to eat at</review>< Pics>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Super delicious food ... The restaurant was recommended to us by the employee of the travellodge St. Maria. The steak was excellent fried, the greetings from the kitchen, the bean stew was spectacular. Prices a bit higher, but according to the level of the food ... Highly recommended

(Original)
Super leckeres Essen... Das Restaurant wurde uns vom Angestellten der travellodge St. Maria empfohlen. Das Steak war hervorragend gebraten, der gruss aus der Küche, der bohneneintopf war spektakulär. Preise eher etwas höher, aber dem Niveau des Essens entsprechend... Sehr zu empfehlen< /Review>
