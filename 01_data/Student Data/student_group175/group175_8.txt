Nice people, decent place. Views were better from places you could walk to than where you could sit, and they didn’t comp the tastings of you bought bottles (atypical around here). Not the best place we went this weekend but the Sommelier was great.< /Text>

<text>The property is very nice, beautiful and elongated. They have pretty good setup for private events and wedding but our wine tasting experience was very average. Right now they seat people next to the parking lot (no views) instead of using the better areas for seating and wine portion for tasting are definitely very small in terms of tasting. Not very welcoming server. The good part is, it is in a very peaceful and quite location so you can enjoy some quite time.< /text>< Pics>

I reserved Fogarty for June 19 after checking with them twice that the date was being held for me. I got the list of catering they allow and talked to one and finalized menu. Called them and checked one more time before inviting people. Then I got a call today (May 21st) that there was a miscommunication and the patio was not available anymore (they asked me to use a room or change my date)! Very very unreliable and disappointing. Take your business somewhere else if you want a reliable venue. I have worked with Pichetti and Ridge previously and they are very responsive, reliable and professional.<//text>

this place is very pretty, the staff is great, the location is accessible and quiet, and the wine and food is top class. i'm 15 but i have the perks of being in the family. its great for venues, and taking a day trip there is worth it< /Review>

Place some outdoor seating which is hit by the sun around 2pm - good plave to sit if you want to share a  bottle of something while there. You can bring your own food to eat at the patio as well.
The road up the hill there is slightly painful but worth doing.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>To be honest, this winery seems to have a dearth of pleasant seating options. While nice views are advertised, you will struggle to find them during a tasting session. On a warm day it will not be a particularly pleasant experience.

Moral of the story: if you like drinking good wine in a parking lot, you will love this place. I'm not a somm but I did watch the Netflix documentary and I'd rate the wine as solid with a hint of asphalt.

Just kidding sort of. Maybe. Most of the reviews seem to be of the private/event venue and not the tasting room area. Those are two separate businesses.<//text>< time>

I’m a wedding coordinator who had a wedding at Thomas Fogarty Winery. The view here is really amazing and the facility is excellent. All our guests enjoyed the perfect wedding here. Plus, highly recommend the catering services. Their food is delicious! All of our guests, including bride and groom— were impressed with the food and service. I would highly recommend!!!<//review>

Small winery packing a punch in pinot noirs as climate soil sun shines on grapes giving this area a distinctive quality. Knowledgeable tasting room staff. Dr. Thomas Fogarty was a physician cardiology and Professor at Stanford. Go and drink a toast contribute to his legacy.<//Review>

It was very peaceful and the day was clear enough that we could see San Francisco and the Bay Bridge all the way down to Alviso/Santa Clara. The vineyards and facilities are beautiful! It was a bit windy in the late morning and early afternoon, but part of our time was inside and not on the pavilion. This place is perfect for special events as well, including a wedding ceremony+reception event, and the tasting room was open after our event so some of our participants stopped by and enjoyed that aspect as well.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>We drove 2.5 hours to get there on Sat Aug 27th only to find out we could hardly see or visit anything there.  There was a wedding at the place and the whole area blocked to visitors, even areas where nothing was going on.  We were extremely disappointed. We could only go the the tasting room, that was it. We were not able to view any of the scenery pictures posted online.  Had they posted something online, we wouldn't have wasted our day driving there. It would have better to just buy a bottle instead.  Not sure even if there wasn't a wedding, we  could still see the whole winery, since they had "private" signs all over.  It is possible that this place is only for weddings not public visitors.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful winery and facility. We hosted an all day event here and it was a great setting, the food was better than expected and the presentation was superb, but the same cannot be said for the service with one very arrogant and obnoxious waiter (hence 4*). Definitely worth a visit.< /Review>

Love coming here for tastings - the view is spectacular and the tasting room is gorgeous. Lots of large open decks to wander around on and admire the view. The staff is friendly and you never feel rushed or pressured.</review>

The location and scenery is very nice, the service at the tasting was fun and friendly, and the wines were OK in my opinion, but this review is about the customer service.  When I visited with my family we purchased a few bottles after the tasting to take home.  Later that weekend we opened one of the bottles of wine we noticed right away a bunch of purple sludge on the cork and inside the bottle.  The wine smelled like it was sour and the taste was horrible.  The bottle was a waste.  As I already had email communications with the winery to find out holiday hours I contacted them about the bottle we couldn't drink.  I intended to get a refund or a replacement, but my emails went ignored.  I mentioned this story to some of my coworkers and one told me he had the same experience: bottles he brought home were bad and he couldn't get a refund after he called them.  So in my opinion you should visit this winery for the scenery, chatting with the lady at the tasting bar, and tasting wines that are not too special (but that's my opinion), but I don't recommend buying any bottles.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Excellent views over the entire Bay Area from the property, and some very nice wines to sample. They have chardonnays, merlots, pinot noirs, syrahs, cabernet francs etc. Many are blends from various Santa Cruz vineyards, and some are single vineyard wines. The tasting was pleasant and unrushed. Coming here is a nice reward after a walk on one of the many nearby trails.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808faf3b3b5dded7:0xaafd78d2f674a37d< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Alex and her staff are wonderful! Attentive, patient and consistent. The facility is very clean and comfortable, and everyone’s privacy is respected. I was coming to Holistic Hyperbarics for support with one health goal, and got bit by a large dog during the same time. I had a laceration and two punctures; all wounds were completely healed by day 7…a bonus that I wasn’t expecting!<//text>

< Review>
I have had an amazing experience at Holistic Hyperbarics. I initially came here with my sister for her appointments but then decided I wanted to try this out. Alex and her amazing staff made me feel very welcome and comfortable. They are so kind and always super caring. Since I started the chambers, I feel so much better over all and I have a lot less pain in my legs. This has been so healing for me and I love it. The facility is very very clean and calming. This is the best place to come to and the best staff. Thank you guys :).< /Review>

We had such an amazing time at Holistic Hyperbarics!! The staff was so kind and made our first experience in a hyperbaric chamber so comfortable. We were a little nervous going into the chamber initially, but the staff allowed us to take our time and ease into it without any pressure which was very appreciated. Once we were inside and reached the depth of our dive, we spent time reading, meditating, and deep breathing. It was truly a one of a kind experience. The facility is very calming and beautifully decorated. We would love to go back and we love Alex!</Text>

<text>I have been coming to this facility for the past one month, and I cannot say enough about my great experience. Alex and her team are very professional, caring, and are extremely attentive at all times. In the beginning when I went there I was a bit intimidated by the chambers but the staff made me feel so comfortable and alleviated any fears I had. Alex and her team have Made my healing journey very pleasant. Every time I go in for my appointments, I get their full attention and care. I don’t think there are enough words to describe how amazing this facility is. Alex has hired the most professional and amazing staff. If you need to heal in anyway this is the number one place to come to. I am beyond grateful that I have met Alex and her team. Love them  :)))♥️< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x8085792e26f9aa21:0x87b7fb6813cb5f75< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I am a Pro rugby player, I've been training so hard getting myself ready for an upcoming rugby tournament event and one week out I strained my groin and I couldn't go 100% with three days left before the big day. So on Wednesday I had to pull out of training because  my groin was bothering me. Thank goodness I came crossed HOLISTIC HYPERBARIC and I was able to book a session on Friday before my game on Saturday. I promise it was worth every penny. I was able to play a full on game and and the rest of games through the whole tournament.
The entire staff is so helpful and very professional. Thank you for saving my day. The best recovery ever in my opinion. Now I go every other week...< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

We have had the best experience at Holistic Hyperbarics! Alex and her Team are amazing. Alex really cares about her clients and goes above and beyond to see that they have everything they need to have the best outcome from their treatments. The space is very calming and provides a wonderful healing environment. The treatment itself is amazing and has already helped my granddaughter who is an athlete and has a torn ACL to begin the process of recovery. Before and after surgery  as well as long term tools and resources are all part of the treatment plan. After every session my granddaughter felt so much better. Her surgery site is healing beautiful and she is continuing the regimen to a fast recovery.
Alex is so knowledgeable, kind and caring.
Highly recommended Alex, Holistic Hyperbarics her team and this amazing treatment!! Thank you Alex!!<//text>

This was my first time using Hyperbarics for wound healing. I was amazed at how much better my wound looked even after 1 session. I have now completed 5 sessions and I've never felt better and my wound is looking much better. I feel that this treatment sped up my healing by months! I would highly recommend doing this post op any operation. The team at Holistic Hyperbarics is incredible, the space is peaceful...I would go anywhere else. Worth the price!<//review>

<review>What an incredible experience. Our situation is personal, so I won't share our reason for coming in... but ...what I will share is the knowledgeable and professional staff is a perfect start to the incredible visits. Also inviting is the beautiful aesthetics of the space and the details all the way down to the delicious fruit infused water in perfect glass bottles. So greatful for this wonderful holistic space to be nurtured in energy and health.< /review>< Rate>

This is a truly special place. Alex and Jordan made my first hyperbaric experience incredible. I went in stressed and worried and left so calm and at ease. It is a beautiful space with lots of plants and citrus water and hot towels at the end! I can't wait to incorporate this into my weekly routine. I want to come back tomorrow :)< /review>

My daughter went to Holistic Hyperbarics pre-surgery as well as post-op for a knee injury. After consulting with Alex on the best plan to get her ready for surgery, and to help her with her recovery, we came up with a plan that I am convinced has helped her to heal faster. She was up and moving sooner than we anticipated, and each session helped to get her further in her recovery (including some GI issues she was having because of the pain medication). I also can't say enough about the care that Alex places in consulting with each of her clients. She called the afternoon after surgery to check in, provide support, and ensure we had what we needed to get her to where she needs to be. She went above and beyond to make sure we had the tools and resources needed for recovery. Alex and her team are incredible, and I couldn't recommend them more highly. Hoping to get a few sessions for myself soon!</text>

This place is the best if you’re looking to get hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Alex is a wonderful human being and her staff is exceptional. She supported me through my healing journey when I had no one else to even listen to me. I’m eternally grateful to her for her patience and kindness.</Review>

Holistic Hyperbarics took really good care of me. I felt safe, even during the pandemic. And they were efficient and easy to work with. As a cancer survivor, I had daily sessions for two weeks, and each time I was seen on time, the atmosphere was calm, and the staff were helpful.</Review>

Alex is truly caring both with her clients who often are very very sick and her employees who deserve fair pay and a good working environment. The staff are all well qualified individuals and good human beings. I feel privileged to interact with them. I am also glad that I was able to try Hyperbaric medicine and neurofeedback. It may not help you or the results may be profoundly helpful. Either way, Alex and the spa provide people the opportunity to experience a service that is unique.< /text>< pics>

Knowledgeable, Attentive, Caring & Passionate Holistic Care.

Our experience with Holistic Hyperbarics Wellness has been nothing short of exquisite. Founder Alex Williams has been an absolute pleasure to deal with. Alex has full command over the intricacies of the HBOT protocol my client wants to perform. Alex also seamlessly facilitated my clients intake between other team members at HH-Wellness. I am so pleased that my client has received equally fantastic care & attention from the whole team.

Alex & Holistic Hyperbarics Wellness are incredible asset to the HBOT community.< /text>

The atmosphere at Holistic Hyperbarics is so calming and relaxing, I had a very good experience there and left feeling better than when I came in. The owner Alex is absolutely wonderful to sit down and chat with. The space is filled with so many plants and was a very healing place to be. Also, they did an amazing job making it safe by keeping everything clean/sanitized. I recommend this place so much, I can't imagine going anywhere else. I love this place.< /Text>

I am deeply grateful to Alex at Holistic Hyperbarics for her care, her compassion and her willingness to listen and understand my personal experience. In my 35 years of living, I have rarely ever found such a kind business owner who has been so generous with her time and given me such a warm welcome. I haven't yet used the hyperbaric chambers because I was using the neurofeedback services and had a wonderful time getting started there. Austin was a very kind facilitator of how to understand the "brain practices" as I like to call it, and he took very good care of me. The space is gorgeous and incredibly clean and spacious with a high ceiling and lots of cool green plants all around! I hope that this business continues to grow and expand to other areas of the bay or the country. Alex has a lot of integrity and I am grateful I got to meet her and I hope to return before I move to Washington so that I can try the hyperbaric chambers!!< /Review>

They have uniquely combined technological medical advancements with a passion for health. The founder, Alex Williams, is a dynamo who clearly has a passion for helping people, great customer service, and a single drive on getting you results.
HH is helping people with traumatic brain injuries, autism, stroke victims, people with early dementia, people who simply want to heal a surgery incision faster, find hope and healing.
They combine hyperbaric—a cutting edge oxygen therapy that’s a century old but that practitioners are applying successfully to a host of ailments. And it’s working.
Plus, the “spa” is incredibly pleasant. I honestly thought being locked inside a large pressurized metal tube for an hour and a half would be difficult. Instead, once my ears adjusted at the beginning, it was incredibly relaxing, a place to relax and read with soothing white noise. I could communicate at any time through walkie talkies with staff, who circled every 15 minutes reassuringly. Coming out, I was greeted by warm towels, citrus and cucumber infused water, and vitamins. Most important, a stubborn knee muscle injury got better.
From my experience, HH combines professionalism and compassion.
Management is determined to meet the needs of people not being helped often by conventional medicine. I know they will grow, because they are providing medical services to solve seemingly unsolvable problems. Most exciting: they are combining hyperbaric use with QEEG—an innovative way to take snapshots of brain waves to see past brain injuries and disease and then find ways to reactivate brain tissue. I’ll be back!<//text>< rating>

I broke my shoulder in a cycling accident, and started HBOT as part of my rehabilitation process.   I was able to go thru the rehab process without using any pain meds, and the best part was when after 10 weeks I went back in for my follow up orthopedics appointment and the doctor exclaimed - "Oh WOW!   I didn't expect you to be healed by now with full movement and flexibiity. You are 3 months ahead of schedule."      HBOT certainly made the difference, and Holistic Hyberbarics was great during the whole process as I loved all the attention to detail on the overall experience that they have curated for the treatments.</review>

I was looking for hyperbaric therapy and came across a few places that all looked quite medicalized and sterile.  Then I heard about Holistic Hyperbarics in Oakland and saw pictures of their beautiful spa.  I also learned it was run by a POC like myself and I was sold.  When I called to inquire about therapy services for my specific situation Alex, the owner, was the one who answered.  Alex was kind, reassuring and took the time to answer all of my questions. Alex also told me that I'd be eligible for the Community Worker Discount which was a huge plus! HH was willing to work around my schedule and was incredibly accommodating - they got me in for whatever days and times I wanted. The staff were warm, caring and efficient in their work.  They always made me feel safe each dive I took.  Alex was very attentive in checking in on how the hyperbaric treatment was going and how my body was responding.  The inside of the hbot shell was extremely comfy - a ton of pillows and blankets.  I frequently took naps because it was so cozy. Staff were more than happy to adjust the lighting in the shell for napping or reading needs.  The ambiance in HH is very peaceful with lots of greenery.  Sitting in the fancy chairs with hot towels and fruit infused water was a relaxing treat after a dive.  I cannot recommend Holistic Hyperbarics enough!!!!<//review>< Pictures>

This place is AMAZING!!! and can do wonders to your body. Referred by my co-worker for post-op laparoscopy surgery recovery. The place is very clean and pandemic safe. LOVE!!! the plants that are in the facility, feels like a tropical jungle. The staff are very friendly and helpful if you need any assistance. I was able to meet the owner Alex, such a sweetheart and knowledgeable of oxygen therapy. I came in for 6 sessions. After having 4 days of oxygen therapy, I notice a great difference of how I felt. I had energy and did not feel much pain where I had my surgery, it felt like I never had surgery. I totally recommend this place for anyone who needs oxygen therapy.<//text>

<user_name>Madison Frilot<//user_name><text>This is the ultimate form of self-care! My experience at HH was simply magical. Even though it's an intense experience to be sitting in a sealed and pressurized tube for 90+ mins, the staff made me feel held and taken care of every step of the way. The space is luxurious, covered with plants and 11/10 decor. The main staff member I interacted with was super friendly and conversational - you can tell the staff is looked out for and VERY well trained. He clearly had a strong grasp of the inner-workings of the tank and all of its benefits, and answered all of my questions... and then some! I would recommend HH without a doubt and will definitely be going back.< /text>< Pictures>

Alex is the reason I keep coming back to Holistic Hyperbarics. She's compassionate, knowledgable, and her presence always makes me feel better. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has helped my chronic joint pain, my energy, and my anxiety. Thanks HH!</Review>

<review>I chose this service due to its proximity and weekend availability.  I limped into the facility and immediately felt comfortable and well received.  Alex, who manages the services was both patient and very knowledgeable.  The session brought both relief and good advice for how to address an ugly foot wound.  I’m grateful for the professional assistance I experienced.</review>< Rating>

I’ve been coming to see Alex and the team for A few months in between hospital stays to address a myriad of chronic illness. We have focused on using Hyperbarics to help with my immune system and post-surgical care and it has been so amazing! Not only have I felt stronger and that I am recovering faster but the dives have helped with my over energy and wellbeing. As someone who has dealt with chronic illness for over a decade I am always looking for holistic ways to help my body deal with and recover from illness and I have found so much help and relief from my dives at Holistic Hyperbarics. I’m so grateful to know Alex and her team and to be able to benefit from Holistic Hyperbarics!</review>

This place is phenomenal, very professional, LGBTQIA+ inclusive, and they're taking extra precautions during the pandemic to keep everyone safe (both staff and patients)! I do neurofeedback with them and it's made such a HUGE difference in my executive dysfunction, anxiety, and depression – better than anything I've ever tried! The initial brain mapping was helpful and definitely accurate bc it echoed things I was already feeling. It's great bc the brain mapping gives you tangible data so you can measure and see your progress (as well as custom tailor your neurofeedback). The neurofeedback sessions are enjoyable and remind me of a video game.

I have lots of allergies, and they're so accommodating! They're great about staying on top of which products not to use for me bc I'm allergic, and which products they CAN use to make sure everything is cleaned properly so there isn't a covid risk. I don't have to remind them which is a huge burden off my shoulders. They make me feel extremely safe!

I've also suffered from chronic migraines most of my life, and I didn't have anything that helps me consistently – I had all but given up bc nothing works. But they're very knowledgeable and educated about health issues (more than some of my doctors), and they were able to figure out what the problem might be and come up with a solution! Their oxygen therapy helps me so much and they even accommodated me with a slightly different set-up bc I have other medical conditions that make it so I can't use traditional hyperbaric oxygen chambers.

Everyone is also very kind and friendly. I can't recommend them highly enough! No matter what you need, they'll be able to figure it out and make you feel better! Even when the rest of the healthcare field leaves you feeling hopeless, they will be able to help!< /Text>

Living with autoimmune is tough enough, but when I contracting Covid,  after 9 months of continual symptoms of fatigue, inflammation, GI issues and tinnitus.  I decided to try hyperbarics after two sessions I felt a significant improvement in my tinnitus, fatigue and GI issues. I highly recommend this for anyone suffering post Covid symptoms. Also the staff is amazing, much respect to the owner Alex she is absolutely wonderful and will help you through the process of booking.<//review>

Such a more personable and real experience than other hyperbarics locations. This place is LUSH; plants everywhere. It has a cozy spa feel but so obviously has high clinical standards.
Alex, the owner, is amazing and really listens to your personal issues. My partner's foot was deteriorating from complications of an autoimmune condition but after starting hyperbarics their foot bounced back! Great bloodflow and bones finally healing up.
I can't suggest this place more.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I've been to other facilities, but none are as warm and caring as this.

The owner is totally focused on your care, as are all her people.

If I hadn't been referred by a doctor, I may have questioned this, but have seen significant benefits in a short period.

Treat yourself, your body will thank you< /text>< user_name>

Holistic Hyperbarics is changing my teenage son's life. He had a head injury when he was young and with just a few sessions we already see improvement in his mood and cognitive function. Alex is an amazing healer and human being and I believe this place is a godsend. I highly recommend Holistic Hyperbarics.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Anyone undergoing fertility treatment from IVF to egg freezing needs to come here for at least one session, esp if they are having trouble getting the results they want or are in a lot of discomfort - period.

I began the process of egg freezing in September and wish I had come to Holistic Hyperbarics then instead of toward the end of my procedure in October only because of the noticeable, immediate results I experienced. I live with fibromyalgia, a musculoskeletal condition with fatigue and pain sensitivity - needless to say, the daily injections and body changing I was going thru were taking a toll both physically & emotionally. I also had one ovary that was - well - not producing up to expectations. I was really scared that this expensive, invasive procedure was going to yield a low number of eggs, which at my age and financial level was heartbreaking to fathom.

I read online that oxygen therapy can help boost egg development and although the science convinced me, the prices kept me at bay. I was already shelling out thousands and while I was prepared to incur the debt of the procedure itself, “add ons” felt out of reach.

Finally, after floating the idea to my doctor & keeping in mind that several hundred dollars is way less than another full round of IVF-style egg freezing, I contacted HH. I was really stressed, nervous and unconvinced, frankly, but I was ready to try and keep my expectations realistic.

After two sessions (which I was able to easily book very last minute btw) my abdominal muscles were more relaxed, my back & neck were pain free, my mood was more even, and my sleep was STELLAR. And 12 out of 13 of my eggs reached maturity! Totally exceeded my doc’s initial expectations of 5-8!!

Shout out to owner extraordinaire Alex, who both made me feel comfortable, heard, and well cared for. Above & beyond does not begin to describe the patience and communication this team possesses. I knew instantly I was in good hands but again, the results proved that by themselves.</review>< Pictures>

Alex is a wealth of well paced, easy to understand knowledge.  Every step of the way I felt supported.  What was so special and unique were the subtle little touches that gave me a true sense of respite and allowed for full relaxation.  A real spa like feeling, complete with warmed moist towels, vitamins and infused filtered water; all designed to aide in the ultimate healing experience.

Plus, the place is all people friendly.  The staff is diverse and incredibly kind and helpful.

It's also, a really pleasant environment— clean but not sterile with real plants everywhere and comfortable seating with neutral yet stylish interior.

The exterior has grit, as in the Street where Hyperbarics is located— I took a taxi/Lyft here and found that was an ideal way to come and go.<//review>

I’m a dancer so my day to day life requires both physical and mental stamina without a whole lot of rest time. I can say that my time in the chamber at Holistic Hyperbarics provided some of the most efficient whole body rest I’ve had. Directly after my session I felt calmer and more alert. Physically my body felt rejuvenated and replenished. Going right back into rehearsals, Long techs, and shows the week after my chamber session I felt strong and resilient. I’m hooked and can’t wait to get back in!<//Review>

I discovered Holistic Hyperbarics when I needed an acute aide to a skin issue. The chamber healed my skin when the docs told me I would need to wait another 3 months. The service provided is a unique nugget in a myriad of medically based services that don’t always work; hyperbarics has SO many heath benefits & it’s a technique that is not readily available to the general public. Holistic Hyperbarics provides a service that is so amazing. Alex & her staff are knowledgeable and thorough with everything from lots of questions, to accommodating everyone’s situation whilst entering and exiting the chambers.

My whole family has been in the chambers the last couple weeks. From my aged grandmother who needed assistance entering the chamber, to my 5 yo daughter who had dental work done and needed a jolt of help with healing.

I highly recommend checking out Alex’s spot- there’s really no reason not to. The hyperbaric chambers are miracle workers & thank you Alex for bringing them to Oakland and making it possible to use them without a huge process with the medical administration system.<//text>

< review>
I’m now three weeks post-op from a hip replacement due to a bicycle accident. The orthopedist today was amazed at how well I am doing, how nicely healed the surgical incision is coming along. The doctor today said I’m well ahead of the usual rate of healing. At three weeks I’m where some people take six weeks to be this far along. This will be my 12th “dive” in the large chamber and I’m sure giving my busily self-repairing body this oxygen dose has improved my recovery. The staff is professional and friendly, and while the finishing touches are still being worked on at the new Adeline St. clinic/ spa, this is truly a great place to help make oneself whole and healthy again. Great job Alex Williams for making this medical treatment more accessible.< /review>

I have only positive things to say about Holistic Hyperbarics. I did 5 sessions to speed my healing from an injury. Alex, the owner, is incredibly caring and thoughtful. The same goes for her staff. They answered all my questions knowledgeably but never tried to oversell the service or promise miracle cures. They just moved into a new space on Lowell and are quickly creating a spa-like atmosphere filled with plants—it’s a nice space to relax in after your treatment. If you think hyperbaric therapy could help with your health situation, this is the place to go.< /text>

Yesterday was my first experience of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and it was amazing! The owner, Alex, is incredibly knowledgeable and takes her time walking you through the entire process. I felt calm, informed and comfortable. The complimentary vitamins and hot towels were a nice bonus to the exceptionally caring environment. I was surprised by how immediately energized I felt after the therapy and the day following. I'm definitely planning future visits-- mostly to help with digestive problems and focus. The space itself is organized, clean and quiet. Highly recommended!< /review>

I had such an awesome experience at Holistic Hyperbarics! Alex is friendly and knowledgable, and she patiently answered my questions and explained the process in language that I could easily understand. The chamber was like a relaxation time machine for me -- I brought my book inside and read, napped a while, and came out feeling totally renewed. I'll definitely visit again!< /Text>

<text>Great experience. The chamber takes a little getting used to and I would highly recommend not drinking anything prior to entering since the pressure pushes on your bladder (I'd had a cup of coffee). Overall, the experience was comfortable, clean, and helped me feel rejuvenated.

<review>I have lived with chronic Lyme disease for almost a decade and experience flares of symptoms every few months in the form of inflammation in my joints, bones and brain. Hyperbaric O2 therapy has been such a helpful tool and resource in decreasing my symptoms and increasing resilience. The space is clean and super comfortable.

Doing treatment with Holistic Hyperbarics was my first time for a treatment of this kind. And it was a great experience! Alex was great at walking me through the experience and answering any questions I had. The 100% oxygen + increased air pressure is a relaxing experience with so many health benefits. It's an easy thing to fit into your health routine.<//text>

<review>My partner and I have been going to Holistic Hyperbarics for the last couple of months, and our experience has been fantastic.  The owner, Alex, has been extremely personable, empathetic, and kind in assisting us, and has accommodated a variety of our needs.  The chambers themselves are very nice and clean, with a perfect spread of small necessities: blankets, pillows, adjustable lighting, and most important of all: chewing gum, to combat the pressure change.

The 'descent', as the pressure change itself is called, has always gone smoothly, and once down, it's easy to just fall asleep for the duration of the session.  When the session is complete, Alex comes through to wake you via intercom, and once out, you're greeted with a glass of water and a few supplementary vitamins to accelerate your acclimation.  The overall experience is very spa-like.

Alex has made it clear us that their goal is to assist in healing for those in need using this fascinating approach, and has done a lot to make the healing process for my partner both more pleasant and more manageable.  We're super grateful that Alex is providing mHBOT services in this area at a fraction of the cost of other providers in the area.  Highly recommended!< /review></record>

This is great for rest and restoration. I tried it for the first time after a brutal work trip, and came out of the chamber feeling like I'd just had a good night sleep. I've been back a few times since then, and it's made a big difference in helping me feel rested. As the parent of a toddler, there's somehow never enough sleep....Highly recommended either for yourself, or as a present for a parent in your life.<//review>

<user>100420379935018756623</user>< Review>
I had bounced from physical therapist to physical therapist but simply couldn't get my injury from a car accident fixed. I had scar tissue deep in many areas of my body. Hip, ankle, shoulder etc. Anytime I found a method of Physical therapy that did work, the bone would pop out of the joint or be unset because my entire body was packed with scar tissue. It felt like a small layer of foam was between many of the joints in my body. I read about hyperbarics from an author I was following in the software sphere, Tim Ferris. Hyperbarics is a new area of science and so I was unsure if it would work for my issue. I was planning on going in for 60 sessions for my specific ailment based on what I had read online. Alex actually insisted that I do 40 as this would be the minimal effective dose. Keep in mind she actually has a clear economic incentive to just tell me to do more and more sessions. She could have easily told me to do 80 sessions and many people would go through with it.

To me, this is the most important sign that holistic hyperbarics is run from the standpoint of truly trying to help people and actually get to the root of the problem. Not to swindle people out of their money.

I was really skeptical and the technology felt really intimidating. Alex and her assistant Brody both walk you through the whole process step by step. They also check in with you to ensure that you don't experience bad side effects. They are also genuinely interested in the progression of your ailment even after you are done working with them.

Lastly, I encourage you guys to look up the other hyperbaric facilities in the area. For the most part, they all cost much more on a per session basis (at least double) and are significantly less structured in their entire process to take you in.

I could not recommend Holistic Hyperbarics more. It truly is a breath of fresh air from our inefficient and greedy medical system!</Review>

This is a fun review to write because my opinion of this place started out quite skeptical and really turned around for the better as I got to know them over the summer of 2019.  BACKGROUND: I have chronic Lyme, Bartonella and Babesia infections, diagnosed in 2004, and eventually started the Buhner herbal protocol.  I got very sick and was unemployed and bedridden for a good portion of that time, and barely remember it.  After a couple of years of that and some improvements but not as much progress as I had hoped, I switched doctors and tried prescription antibiotics alone for a few years, with testing every 3-4 months and switching up the exact drugs a couple times a year.  I got much better, tested negative for Bartonella and then Babesia multiple times, but then as I got to the cyst-busting stage of the Lyme treatment, all hell broke loose and it all came back very aggressively.  It was at this backsliding low point I become terrified and knew I needed something more.  So, I decided to do everything I could simultaneously: 1) prescription antibiotics 2) herbal antibiotics 3) chiropractic and soft tissue bodywork, AND 3) hyperbaric oxygen.  I found Holistic Hyperbarics as the nearest center, since I did some research and figured I would need a lot of sessions, the proximity was important.  Unfortunately it was right in the middle of their move, so there was some confusion and I showed up at the old location, not happy.  But I called Alex and she paid for my Uber and made it right.  I'm glad I stuck through that rocky start, because the HBOT started to bring benefits after just a few sessions.

PERSONAL HBOT EXPERIENCE: I had had severe "spasticity" (unconscious muscle tension) along my left side for years, which affect my gait and ability to do many household chores with my hands, sometimes even typing.  After my third HBOT session in 10 or so days, I felt something amazing - it started to relax.  I excitedly wrote my doctor that it felt like I had released a silent scream and the mental and physical tension were dissappearing.  She mentioned that this was likely due to a CNS/brain problem resolving with oxygen, and she started recommending HBOT to more of her patients. My chiropractor also immediately noticed the difference when he laid hands on my back, "what did you do?  You feel like a totally different person!"  He was surprised to see such improvement so rapidly.  He spent an hour every week with me getting me to rebalance my gait and working out my many soft tissues adhesions.  Little by little I got more range of movement and started to exercise again.  I completed a course of 40 HBOT sessions, usually going 3-5 times per week, to 2.4 ATM for 75 minutes (after acclimation).  I started sleeping better, and working more (consulting part-time) as my mind came back.  My sense of humor and other quirky aspects of my personality also came back!  I started doing long hikes in the Oakland hills, then my chiro cleared me to try running!  I am 52 and thought my running days were over long ago, but soon I was doing 5-mile trail runs on steep and rocky terrain!  (as I had in my 30s) Professionally, I have also been gaining momentum, with a new challenging full time job.  So far, it's going well.  It's been about 6 months since I started HBOT, and 3 months since I stopped doing it intensively, and the changes have been largely durable.  I still pop in one every week or two to stay tuned up and resolve the ever-changing aches and pains as I continue to progress with my antibiotics.  Overall, my life now is very manageable.  I cannot ever promise this will happen for anyone else since there is such a vast difference in every Lyme case, and I was doing so many interventions at once, but I am very, very thankful I found Holistic Hyperbarics!  I also love the space and the people, Alex is an inspiration to me in many ways, and I always look forward to catching up when I'm there.</text>

<Text>I started getting treated after having my daughter. I was 6 weeks post partum and I had gotten really bad mastitis. My mastitis was so bad that I ended up having to get my breast cut open and drained.

I started treatments right afterwards and my breast specialist was so impressed with how quickly I healed. The amazing part was that I was afraid that the surgery would hurt my supply and was told it probably would. But because of my treatment with HH my milk supply did not suffer.

On top of my amazing recovery, treatment also had some amazing side effects on my post partum body. It helped with my supply so much. After my treatments I would pump twice as much breastmilk than I was pumping before.

I also had sever hemorrhoids from giving birth, to the point where surgery was being reccomended. But after 3 sessions with HH they were cleared up and I no longer needed to consider surgery. HH is amazing for new mothers. Not only does it help heal your post partum body faster, you also get to have an uninterrupted nap!< /Text>< Pics>

I really enjoyed my first experience here. I had been traveling, to Europe and Texas in subsequent weeks, and I have a very energetic 2-year old. Needless to say I'm always a little behind on sleep, and the travel made it worse. My 1.5 hours in the tank left me feeling amazing, as if I had slept for 10 hours!!! Can't recommend this enough to pretty much anyone.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Wonderful experience! I went in after a very stressful month of moving my business  (12,000 lbs of industrial equipment). My back was sore and all my old injuries were feeling aggravated. Not to mention I had been sleeping poorly from the stress of it all. The day after my treatment my back and joints felt better and I got the best night of sleep I had in weeks. The whole experience was really great. It was so comfortable and relaxing. The oxygen helped clear my head while I kicked back and read a book for an hour in a cozy bed. Afterwards I got mint water and hot towels! Highly recommended.< /Text>< Pictures>

I was introduced to Holistic Hyperbarics during the Norther California FIRES in late September - early October 2017. As a result of the fires, my lungs were suffering, I was sick and coughing up mucus daily. In addition to not sleeping well, I was experiencing serious issues breathing and congested for weeks. A friend introduced me to HH suggesting that it would help me feel better and at the very least, breathe better! During my first visit I was in the chamber for an hour. I noticed an immediate difference in the way I felt. I wasn't sluggish and tired. I actually had energy, and was breathing better. I scheduled 2 more appointments, after which I made a full recovery. I LOVE Holistic Hyperbarics. I now go in a couple of times per month.< /Text>< Pictures>

I LOVE this place and the people who run it.  I am beyond grateful that I found it as I have NO DOUBT that utilizing their Healing Oxygen Chambers will bring me back to full health in a short period of time.

I was pleasantly surprised at how roomy the chambers are, I can actually sit up in them and I am quite tall.  They also give you a walkie to take inside the chamber with you so that you are always in contact with the team and never feel alone.

I find the experience very relaxing and peaceful and I tend to take the opportunity when in the chambers to have a siesta.

I am so over the top impressed by Alex and her team.  It is clear to me that Alex is passionate about helping people to heal, to reclaim their life.  She is extremely knowledgeable and works closely with a couple of medical doctors to ensure all your healing needs are fully and completely met.  You can tell that Alex is in it for the compassionate service to others.

Alex's prices are the best in the Bay Area as is her customer care and service.  Alex's mission is to make this treatment accessible to everyone and not just the uber wealthy and she is doing it..

Alex's Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Medical Spa is super easy to access, just a few minutes of the freeway and has plenty of parking.  Alex and her team have created a healing oasis.  Just walking into their Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Medical Spa makes me feel so much better.  She has lots of beautiful plants everywhere, stunning moss walls/art, zero gravity chairs, it is so beautiful and you can tell she put her heart and soul into it.  After treatment you receive two fresh, clean hot towels and vitamins along with purified water.

If you are considering receiving this treatment I would say run rather than walk to Alex's Hyperbaric Oxygen Medical Spa, whether it's for a sports injury, autoimmune disorder or a serious medical condition Alex will take care of you in the best way possible.</Text>

I had an amazing experience at Holistic Hyperbarics and recommend it to all my rugby buddies for both performance and recovery!

I went for the first time in 2017 when I heard our national tournament was going to be held outside of Denver. With limited time to get acclimated, the oxygen therapy really gave me a performance edge and I felt no ill-effects from the dramatic increase in altitude. Since then, I've kept coming back to help ease the aches and pains. It dramatically decreases the recovery time needed between rough sessions on the pitch.

I was skeptical of hyperbaric oxygen therapy at first. But then again, I'm kind of skeptical of anything. However! This is not some hippy woo-woo thing, it's real medical science with proven results, delivered by medical professionals who really know their stuff. Alex was kind, down-to-earth, patient, and professional, walking me through the whole process.

Plus, their office is gorgeous. And there are cookies.< /text>

<Text>Walking right in the door ms. Williams was extremely courteous and professional. She explained everything thoroughly and answered all of our questions. Ill admit I was a but nervous since this was my first time. But with a calm environment and reassurance i felt 100% safe and comfortable for our dive. I felt well accommodated and very comfortable in a warm and calming environment. The dive was itself was everything I had expected since it was throughly explained to me and, following instructions, the gum helped alot. I was so calm in fact, I ended up falling asleep! When it was time to come out it was a relatively quick process and there was even some flavored water and warm towels that felt so good after my dive. Since im an avid runner and had run 7 miles the previous day, i felt so refreshed I was ready for another 7! I would definitely recommend you try a chamber session for yourself especially if your work is labor intensive or athletes in general. Discover it for yourself!<//Text><GmapID>0x8085792e26f9aa21:0x87b7fb6813cb5f75< /GmapID>< user>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Came here to get into a hyperbaric chamber for the first time. Alex made sure to go over everything with me before entering the chamber. She is very knowledgeable and is more than willing to answer any questions you have. She stays with you as you take your dive to make sure everything goes smoothly. She was not joking about how many times you will have to pop your ears as you start to go down. Once at the optimal pressure there is no more popping of the ears and you're free to sleep, read, play on your phone, basically pretty much anything. You are always connected to her even if she is not in the room by radios.

Now let me tell you about the chamber.. it is pretty big,comfortable, and it even have changing color lights! I was on my phone for probably ten mins and then decided I would nap. It was so easy to fall asleep because Alex provides you with a comfy blanket and pillow.  At the end of the session you are given vitamins, refreshing water, and a hot towel for your face. I felt extremely refreshed. That night I had one of the best sleeps of my life, and felt even better the next day. I've had to study a ton for school, and the day after the chamber I felt way more focused while studying.

I highly recommend coming here!< /text>< Pics>

I am a wedding photographer and 1.5 days before I was supposed to photograph a wedding, I pulled some muscles in my neck that left me in excruciating pain (only second to childbirth) and so stiff I couldn't turn my head without looking like a robot.  I was in panic mode since I can't exactly take sick days for my job which also happens to be pretty physical, and so I decided to give the chamber a try and went in for my first dive.

After I explained my situation to Alex over the phone she was able to give me a same-day appointment and was very confident that my time in the chamber would really help my neck muscles heal.  And she was right.  I was actually able to relax and even fell asleep while I was in the chamber.  I emerged feeling less stiff and in considerably less pain and was able to photograph the wedding the following day.

Honestly, this felt like a miracle treatment.  I was freaking out about what I was going to do and Holistic Hyperbarics saved my a$$.  I'm so grateful for Alex's expert care and guidance throughout this experience.  I highly recommend trying hyperbaric therapy, especially if you're recovering from an injury.</review>

Alex is super friendly, and explains all the information you need. She had great energy and it's a pleasure to be around.

I was hit by a car and had traumatic brain injuries, and ORIF surgery in my tibia and fibula. After the first hyperbaric chamber therapy started feeling better, noticeably. I very much recommend this to anyone needing healing, more energy or for helping your own body heal.<//review>

<Date>1522830588886<//Date><Text>I had an elective surgery with a little bit of complications. My wound was strained and bruised along my incisions. My surgeon strongly recommended that I should get an oxygen treatment for my wound. Needless to say my surgeon contacted Alex from Holistic Hyperbarics and on that same day we went and sign up for 5 session but ended up taking the 10 session package. The experience was wonderful. After 5 session I went back to my surgeon and together we saw a big difference in my wound. It has dried and I was moving smoothly than in my first few days post op. My shortness of breath has tremendously been improved, my incentive spirometer reading has gone up higher when I’m doing my breathing exercises. The hyperbaric treatment has helped me tremendously! Alex was kind, patient and very accommodating. She would prepare extra pillows for me as I can’t lay flat inside the chamber. The place is very well maintained. I was glad my surgeon sent me here, I highly recommend this place.< /Text><username>Geraldine Cabarse</username>< response>

<review>I just had surgery two weeks ago and the pain was unbearable. I didn't want to keep using pain-killers and got a recommendation from my out-of-state doctor and my doctor's patients I met on a forum to try Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments. I stumbled upon Holistic Hyperbarics after calling all the other Hyperbaric treatment centers in the Bay Area and my choice was an easy one. Not only was the treatment significantly cheaper ($160 vs $350+), but Alex seemed the most knowledgeable and caring. Her calming and confident presence on the phone reassured me that I was making the right choice, and I booked the next available appointment.

When I came into the office, I was expecting a surgical-type atmosphere but was pleasantly surprised to find a tranquil and calm space. Alex and Elijah were both very friendly, attentive, and calmly walked me through the process so I knew what to expect. The details and thoughtfulness of the space and instructions were impeccable. You could tell Alex put a lot of thought into what people wanted and needed when creating her business to make her clients feel comfortable and secure.

Before I got into the pod (which reminded me of a fancy tanning booth minus the harmful radiation with a plush mattress, blanket, and pillows), my ace bandages hurt from the inflammation I got from my 6-hour flight the day before, I had fluid build-up around the surgical area/shooting pains, and it hurt to breathe. Just after one 90-minute session, I felt like a new person. The inflammation decreased significantly (my bandages were visibly looser than when I had arrived), I could feel that there was less fluid in the surgical area, I breathed better, and the pain decreased by 90%! Since my first experience, I've come in 2 more times and each time I feel much stronger. I feel like I found the secret to hacking my healing process! It makes sense logically as bodies need oxygen to carry out certain functions to heal and this is a way to do this more effectively!

On top of the fantastic results I experienced, what keeps me coming back is Alex and the experience itself! She is highly versed in this space as a former EMT which puts me at ease. And the session always ends with vitamins, water, and hot towels which is something I look forward to at the end. The time always passes quickly, feeling like it's only been 20 minutes, and it's an excellent time to catch up on reading or take the most luxurious nap! I plan to come back regularly even after my healing is done to make sure my body is operating at peak performance and because the way it makes my brain feel. I have a sense of clarity and focus with less brain fog after every session, and wish I would've discovered this much sooner.

Thanks so much, Holistic Hyperbarics!< /review><gmapID>0x8085792e26f9aa21:0x87b7fb6813cb5f75<//gmapID>< Resp>

<Time>1510776091693< /Time><Text>Alex and the team at holistic hyperbarics was welcoming and hospitable. The office felt serene immediately upon entering, like a spa experience. On my first visit I was nervous and didn't know what to expect. Alex guided my done and talked me through the process after I signed paperwork and in the room. The rooms themselves we're very cozy as well, soothing lighting, a robe if you desire, and even a pillow, blanket, and eye mask in the chamber! It was odd at first for me to grasp the concept as I had never done anything like this before, but having the chamber raised and being able to speak with Alex as I dive down was reassuring. I highly recommend holistic hyperbarics as an addition to your health care regimen. Definitely a unique experience, and the variety of health benefits makes it a custom healing experience.<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_id>

I am so happy to be introduced to Hyperbaric Therapy. During my intial visit I felt Alex and assistant were professional, kind, and knowledgeable about the Hyperbaric process. I stayed in the oxygen chamber for 90mins. During the treatment I felt comfortable enough to follow a guided meditation; and if I had questions a staff member would communicate with me via walkie-talkies. Affer the session I felt refreshed, calm, and entergetic. I definitely recommend people giving Hyperbaric's the opportunity to help improve your wellbeing.< /review>

<review>Holistic Hyperbarics is going so above and beyond for their clients- I am astonished with the level of personalized care and genuine connection I’ve had there. I have felt truly seen and heard in a way I haven’t in most other health related interactions.
And their lovely design and complimentary spa additions to the expirence left me feeling unexpectedly pampered! It was So nice leaving the appointment feeling refreshed and cared for, unlike most other health related appointments.
As someone living with an insideous chronic health condition, I am used to facing a lot of cold shoulders, misinformation, and over-priced treatment centers. The owner of HH is well versed in So many health issues, including ones like mine on the fringe of medical science. I struggle with a lot of symptoms and have tried a lot of protocols, but after only three hyperbaric treatments I’m feeling more energized, clear, and sleeping better then I have in years. I cannot recommend this place higher.. I would if I could. Check it out!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

I finally had the opportunity to try Holistic Hyperbarics and was thoroughly impressed with the experience.  Alex answered all my questions, from her history with hyperbaric oxygen therapy; to what my first experience would feel like; and about safety in the chamber and afterwards.   From the beginning to the end of my time at Holistic Hyperbarics I felt well taken care of and supported.  I spent my time in the chamber looking at Netflix and relaxing in a meditative state while enjoying the flow of energy within my body.  It’s been about a week since my first experience and while I can’t say for certain my energy and clarity this week is attributed to my first experience with hyperbaric oxygen therapy I can’t rule out it out either.  I am eager to try more sessions with Holistic Hyperbarics to deal with some inflammation in my knees and back.  Brava Alex!< /Text>

Just experienced my first ever hyperbaric session and I was highly impressed by an acute sense of increased wellbeing and clarity afterwards.  Alex offers an environment that is professional, clean, safe, and in which client comfort and care remain central.  Her training as a healthcare specialist, respect for those in her care, and good-natured intelligence and humor is evident throughout, providing a perfect complement to the service she provides.</review>

<resp>None</resp><review>Holistic Hyperbarics is amazing. I was referred here to treat my EDS Hypermobility type. I was skeptical and nervous, but the owner Alex immediately put me at ease. The office has a calm, warm, healing energy, as does Alex. I never felt rushed; Alex took lots of time to understand my health concerns, explain the hyperbaric process and address any concerns or questions. She is professional, kind and empathetic. I felt safe, cared for and listened to. Today, after my first treatment, I have more energy and less pain than I've had in months. I've already booked my next appt and will be going regularly for...ever! I highly recommend anyone considering hyperbarics to try out this incredible service.<//review></record>

Great food, great people. Heads up they only take cash or Venmo. I go toward the end of my day and then I eat half of my burrito or torta and take the rest for lunch at work. I always stop here when I get a chance.<//review>

No, no, no.  I don't want to fight and argue about  who has the best tacos in the Bay Area.  I could literally eat tacos everyday and not just on "Taco Tuesdays".  El Gallo has one of the best Carnitas tacos period and not just for a "taco truck".  At $2.50 per taco, please give me Dos and una Cabeza (head) por favor!</Review>

Oh my goodness! Loved the carnitas tacos, the sliced jalapenos and the lemon to finalize the amazing taco! My BF had carne asada too and he gave them a thumbs up too! Cash or Venmo. Great lunch before heading back on the road! Forgot to take a picture but as you can see, not one piece of meat left on the plate!</Text>

I visit this food truck because its location is convenient for me, their chicken quesadillas are decent, and the staff are friendly. One time, they misheard my order and I got a burrito instead of my usual quesadilla. It really wasn't that good, even when compared to a chain restaurant's burritos (like Chipotle).<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>The tacos from Señora Elena, her daughters, and husband is an obligated stop every time that I visit SF. My favorites: carnitas, pollo, pastor, lengua and carne asada with pickled jalapeños are just simple the best. If you are in the Mission district and you are sick and tired of watching how much the beloved Mission has changed, get to this taco truck and enjoy great food, from a Mexican family that is already an icon in this neighborhood.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Best burritos I’ve had in SF, not too much rice and beans, fresh and fluffy tortillas. Carnitas burritos come with caramelised onions. Pollo asada is flavourful and moist.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

There are lots of awesome carnitas spots but here’s the thing... this place has THE BEST.  It’s always super flavorful and perfectly crispy. Their black beans are the bomb.  Tortilla is perfect. What I’m getting at is that the (super) burrito with carnitas is basically the easiest way to activate and instantaneously align all the chakras</Text>

My husband and I have taken our daughter here since she was old enough to see a dentist. We have NEVER been dissatisfied with the service we receive. Not only are all of the staff so kind and gentle with our babies, the Dentist is A-MAY-ZING!!! This should be the only childrens' dentist in the Antelope Valley. They are that good!!!</Review>

The comfortable atmosphere and warm bed side manors of the male doc and staff is a breathe of fresh air. Doctor Seth really does care about his patients in all aspects of their health I'm really does take the time to explain to you how important dental hygiene is for the body to function appropriately. He also makes it a point to make you feel comfortable in his establishment. And they barely run off of schedule they have a very solid rotation and fluidity to their office even with the transfer of new front house staff. I definitely won't take my children anywhere else I wish I could be a patient myself.<//review>

<Review>Lancaster Childrens' Dental is hands down the best place to take your kid(s)! Each and every staff member was kind, professional, and went above and beyond for not only my child but us, the parents as well.

<review>My daughter needed two teeth pulled. Dr was amazing and my daughter was surprised that the teeth were already out. She didn't feel it at all. Dr and staff really made her comfortable and talked her through the whole thing and even made it a game.<//review>< pics>

This was my toddlers first time at the dentist and it was absolutely fabulous! Everyone in the staff is incredibly kind and patient. My child felt safe and comfortable, that is what is most important. We were also attended quickly and thoroughly, we did not spend more than an hour there. Truly a fantastic dental office!< /Text>

We recommend this place to absolutely everybody who asks! Great people, excellent dentist. My oldest daughter was TERRIFIED of the dentist and after her first visit (extraction) she left their office all smiles and singing! Today my other two had their first experiences with this location and they were slightly nervous but it didn't last long! It's definitely kiddo approved!! Love, love love this place, especially from the parent perspective.<//review>

<text>We were referred by my sons orthodontist. I am beyond happy I took my son! They are so caring, have patience and are perfect for the children that get nervous when talks about dentist comes up. They always accommodate appointment time too as this is the second time I need a last minute appointment and they scheduled me for the following day. They are following COVID 19 measures and I felt safe and at ease because of it. My son who tends to get nervous always leaves satisfied with the service. The staff is great and friendly. I am happy to have found such a great children’s dentist!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c25b278cf514ab:0xd4a14251a00342b< /Gmap_id><user>112392233293955598380<//user>< Date>

After the dentist check my daughter We got a wrong and incorrect info "that my daughter teeth is good and no cavities were found "
Unfortunately we found there were a cavities.
We will definitely call the place to recheck her.
This is not acceptable from a professional dentist.  Definitely the particular dentist needs more practice or training.

Love love love all the staff here! I have never had an issue with any worker or any work done for my daughter here. My daughter is now 9 and I have been bringing her here since she was about 2 or 3... Dr.Sep,, Isabel,, and all the staff down to the receptionist are always so friendly and welcoming. My daughters treatments are always done accordingly never have a problem with wait time with appts.. my daughter doesn’t have a problem coming to the dentist she’s never scared or hesitant and the workers are excellent with kids 😇! Thanks to all the staffing for always making us feel comfortable and for your great service....< /review>

< Review>
Doctor and his assistants are incredibly professional very attentive to my son as well as others. You may be there a bit longer than usual but it's well worth the wait, the attention to detail the attention to my child's specific needs is much appreciated. My son had to get two fillings, the doctor and his assistant literally sang to my son the entire procedure... they were dancing with him joking with him they made him feel incredibly comfortable. They went out of their way to make sure that he could get the fillings he needed while feeling comfortable and being happy while actually getting the treatment. The doctor is very kind and you can tell he works hard to accommodate his little patients. I'm really happy that my son my son has the opportunity to go to this dentist because they care.< /Review>

I have been bringing my son with special needs here for a few years now and LOVE this dentist!! The staff is so good with kids and they walk them through everything they do, every step of the way!! The Doctor himself is absolutely amazing and goes out of his way to accommodate your kid's needs. I could go on and on about how great they are,  but I'd strongly suggest finding out first hand!!< /Text>

I love this place!!! My son was traumatized from a previous dental office I use to take him & when I came here they made 100% effort on making him feel very comfortable & didn't rush anything. It doesn't feel like a dentist office for adults. They go beyond their way to make the children feel comfortable.< /Text>

<text>My young son has extensive dental problems from chemotherapy and Lancaster Children's Dental has been so helpful. They have provided us with necessary referrals to get him the care that he needs, and done as much of the work as they can themselves. The staff has been compassionate and helpful, going out of their way to get him the care he needs.</text>< gmapID>

We’ve been using this Dental group for about a year for my 6 year old and our almost 3 year old had his first appointment today. They are amazing here, our 6 year old struggles with being around people he doesn’t know, especially adults and they’ve always handled his personality perfectly making him feel comfortable the whole time. They did an Amazing job with his fillings he needed done give him confidence whenever he comes in. My 3 year olds first appointment went great and they were very patient with him, while he learned to behave at the dentist. They are very thorough and make sure you know exactly how to help teach your kids how to take care of their mouths and very helpful when you have questions. I’ve never felt anything but welcome and taken care of with the entire staff! They are honestly amazing!</text>

I Love this place! They treat us like family, they are kind and very clean! If your child needs dental care, this is the place to go!!! Even though my daughter had a hard time with the drilling, the office made her feel secure. At the end, the reinforced her desire to come back with a toy and a hug!!!<//Review>

With regards to the dental referral, we do check with the various offices that we refer to, as we understand that our referrals have a direct reflection on our practice, as you alluded to.

That being said, we will definitely take note of that, as our goal is to make sure you have a 5-Star experience, all the way around.

The wait can be a bit most times but they're professional and courteous and handle the job quickly and efficiently. My only issue and the reason for a lack of 5 stars is solely based on my bad experience with a referral to first class dental they gave me. Seems to me if you're going to give out recommendations to other dentist maybe get to know how they operate. Other than that, very good experience.<//Text>

Amazing
The ladies in the front are amazing and very friendly & Welcoming.
My Son is Autistic  & I feel like they actually took the time to get to know him,  I didn’t feel rushed trying to see his teeth. They explained everything they had to work on him step by step, not like the other dentist I took my son to. I’m very happy I found this place 🙃
I’m Definitely going to recommend my friends and family here< /text>

I cannot say enough great things about the staff!  Reception to Dental Assistants to The Dentist himself!  They are top notch and take extremely good care of our children!  We have been going there for close to two years for our 3 children, and have never had anything less than a great experience.  Very highly recommended!!</review>

<time>1504039379140< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>This is my second visit with my son and I couldn't be more impressed with the level of professionalism and service by the staff here. They all go above and beyond to make the children feel comfortable and safe. Their top priority is the patient and ensuring that the parent knows and feels comfortable with all levels of care. I would refer any of my family and friends to this establishment!
As a child I was scared to go to the dentist and I never wanted my children to experience the same fear. I don't have to worry about that here. They make sure I am involved in my child's care and upkeep.
Thank you to the staff at Lancaster Children's Dental! You all rock!! Keep up the excellent work .< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

If I could put 0 stars I would.
I brought both my kids here and my youngest is 2 he needed some work done and they wanted me to take him to a specialist in Bakersfield and put him to sleep for the procedure!!!! Not to mention they were charging me 250 a tooth for the white filling, I went to another dentist around here and they took him in and they did the procedure he needed with just some sedation and the full procedure was covered by my insurance with white fillings !
Then on my other son he is 4 they didn’t allow me to go back with him for X-rays they told me he had 4 cavities. So decided to take him to the other dentist that worked on my 2 year old and they told me his teeth were perfect and no cavities and I was in there for X-rays and everything. Horrible place would not ever ever go back.< /review>

The staff is unbelievably amazing, caring, gentle, organized, etc. My daughter loves going and is extremely comfortable from beginning to end. There's one Assistant (I believe he's a Dental Assistant?) named Jose, he goes above and beyond to make my child feel safe. We even see him at the booths at the AV Fair and stuff...he even remembers my little girl's name. Oh, and I don't think I've ever waited more that 5 minutes after my scheduled time for my child to be in the dental chair! Huge plus since we're talking about a children's office!! I would recommend this office to EVERYBODY!!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<review>My experience with this dental office has been outstanding. The staff is friendly and well equipped to handle children who can be difficult to care for. My son tends to freak out when at a dentist office, but the staff has always been able to handle him very well and make him feel comfortable. I would recommend them to anyone who has children. 2 thumbs up!!!</review>< pics>

Finding a dental office that knows how to deal w/ special needs is very difficult. We've found a home in this office. The entire staff is impeccable. Very friendly, compassionate and most importantly "patient". The receptionist is a real sweetheart.  I highly recommend this office for all children.<//review>

<text>Dr. Seph and his staff were exceptional with my son during his first dental appointment, as well as during a follow-up for two fillings the following week.  I was able to stick by my son through both appointments, through X-rays, cleaning, etc. Dr. Seph showed me the cavities when they were discovered and answered my questions. During both appointments, the staff put my son (and thereby, myself) at ease through the whole process; they seem to have a gift for handling dentistry for children... which I'd imagine can't be easy. I'm glad a friend of mine recommended this office to me; 10/10 I'd recommend to others as well.</text>< gmapID>

I couldn't have picked a better dentist for my daugther.  Highly recommended.  Each person in the staff is just amazing. Fun, happy atmosphere which makes its easily comfortable for children. Sweet , kind techs and dentist. My daugther had awful , fearful experiences at other dental offices. Other places ,She was held down with no meds to relax her, pulled unnecessary teeth, added unnecessary and poorly done caps...but you won't get that here. My child who was once scared to walk into a dentist office, is now excited everytime she goes ! That's something you can't put a price tag on. I love this office.</Review>

<Review>Amazing!! I'm new to the AV and NO ONE has been able to refer me to good providers in Lancaster. Honestly, I was begining to think there weren't any. I looked online for a children's dentist in lancaster hoping to get lucky and find a decent one.  I read reviews on a few and looked on a couple of websites. I decided to call Lancaster Children's Dental because I liked what the info on their website. I spoke to Michelle , the lady at the front desk. She was very nice, helpful and proactive on getting an appt for my daughter the same day. She must have sensed my anxiety becasue she went above and beyond by contacting my insurance and verifying how we would be covered. The office is clean, with tv's and video games for the kids to play.  The wait was 20 min or so with same day appt. Not bad at all. Once inside there are more tvs and everything seems kid friendly. The dentist gave me a detailed explanation on why my daughter was in so much pain. After she was done, Jose cleaned my daughter's teeth.Kudos to Jose. My daughter was so impressed because he was gentle and called her "princess". The office coordinator came in and set up my follow up appts before Jose was even done with the cleaning.  Loved it. EVERYONE was super helpful and kind and the office works amazingly together.<//Review><name>Cori Palomares< /name></record></dataset><record>

Small and tucked away you would not expect the place when you go. Dr. Kauffman and Dr. Saber are great.  Kauffman has short of 20 yrs in the bus and knows his stuff. You want adjustments, massage, acupuncture, sports therapy.....All staff are wonderfully professional and always checking on you. Love this place.< /review>

Facility is Good. Doctor is good but they don't accept all insurance and patient has to pay out of pocket which is not reasonable.< /text>

Good place, Dr. Nic definitely knows what he is doing, I've seen a lot of improvement after going in for my hip ! If there is one comment I'd like to make about possible suggestions, it's that there could be a tad more emphasis on Active Release Therapy (ART) techniques - I know they are a chiropractic center, but still - with their expertise, I would assume ART can be applied / more time could be spent on it.

Shout out to their front desk - super friendly, flexible with re-scheduling and they take care of the billing stuff efficiently/ without causing hassles.< /Text>

< Review>
I was referred to Thrive by my friend and her husband, after my back had went out. Although it it was a recurring back pain for 10 years, I didn't have a regular chiropractor. I've been to quite a few different ones, but they never stood out.

After having my back go out three times in eight months, while coming here, I requested for an MRI. It was the most times my back has ever gone out in such a short time. With the results, Dr. K and Dr. Mike pin pointed that I have a herniated disc, which I never knew about. Dr. K had an idea and with the results, it confirmed it his suspicions.

Dr. K and his staff would see the the day before, on two separate appointments, and the next day, I was back and barely mobile and in chronic pain. As of now, I'm here on a weekly basis, which will then thin out to bi-weekly, etc..., based on how my back is doing.

All in all, everyone from the front desk to the masseuse, whom I haven't seen yet, are friendly and have great customer service! They are always polite, attentive, and concerned. They do have donation boxes and activities for some holidays, which all patients may take part in. They decorate their office during major holidays as well. Everyone is always smiling and helpful, which is a plus!

P.s. If you plan on becoming a regular, I would suggest buying your own pads for STEM. :) Be sure to ask if they grabbed your pads.<//Review>

I've been very skeptical of Chiropractors. It was stemming from everything I've heard about them and not really my experience, but that changed with a single experience with Dr Nick. I had severe pain on my back when bending my neck forward or when touching chin to chest. I didn't know how it started. Tried heat/cold compress, massages, resting etc, but it only got worse. Desperate times took me to my husband's chiropractor Ryan Kaufmann's office. Dr Nick was the one I worked with.  After a small introduction and doing some basic tests, he figured that my back pain was actually referred pain from my neck. Believe it or not, 95 % of my pain was gone with my first round of treatment. By second visit, I was completely cured. THANK YOU!</review>

My first experience with them was when I came in to install their security cameras. I thought they were amazing people as customers. After my accident I went back now as them being the service providers. Long story short, I am super happy about this decision. Everyone there is awsome on skills and great on personality. I hope I never need their service again but if I do, I will not doubt on going back to Thrive Milpitas. I started feeling better since my first visit. Thank you!</Text>

I am very happy with the service provided by both the doctor and the staff. I was very skeptical of chiropractor at first as i was looking for physiotherapyist, but it is combination of both and it turned out great choice. I am very happy with my treatment. Cheers to Dr nick too who works with Dr kauffman<//Text>

I recently booked a consultation at hello smile for braces for my son and a general Dentist for me family. I couldn’t be more pleased with the experience from start to finish. A bright beautifully appointed office with kind and friendly staff welcomed me and the dentists were both Informative, kind and well achieved. When considering a general dentist and /or ortho definitely consider Hello Smile. For me, the search was over once experiencing what the dentists at Hello Smile had to offer.  It’s a no brainier!<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I absolutely loved everything and everyone at Smile Dental in Simi Valley! From the moment I walked in, to the moment I left this office as a new patient, I felt very comfortable and well taken care of. The office staff welcomed me in with a smile and kind attitude. They offered me refreshments while I waited and let me know where their restrooms were should I need to use them. As I was called into the chair, I was handed a remote control to watch anything on Netflix that would ease my mind. The dentist was absolutely amazing in the way he made sure to ask me if I felt comfortable by offering me dark glasses, Vaseline for my lips while cleaning and even which flavor I preferred for my treatment. He’d stop during the procedure time and time again to ask me if I felt any discomfort. Because of the clean, sleek state of the art equipment he used I imagined his prices to be high but to my surprise they we’re definitely reasonable. I would recommend this place to each and every person who is in need of dental work or even a simple clean up.< /Text>< pictures>

Office is brand new, clean and high tech. Doctor and staff try to make you feel as comfortable as possible and even offer to watch tv to relax. Very efficient as well. I had my cleaning, x-ray and filling all in one quick visit. Highly recommend! Also has an orthodontist who works in same office.< /text>

Finding a good on that is gentle and has the latest technology and can see you when you need them can be way out of financial reach for a lot of us.

I went to Dr. Ju on an emergency basis.  I called three offices at 4 AM in excruciating and left messages.  He personally returned my call by 8 AM and told me he could see me by 8:30 AM.  THE SAME DAY!  I had an infected tooth, so the pain was unbearable.  He was extremely patient, gentle, and professional.  He explained everything he was doing in very unerstandable terms.  The office was extremely clean and very state-of-the-art.  Easy parking too.<//review>

1. New office opened in 2020 and all of a sudden with more reviews than a 10-year office; All 5 stars?
2. All the reviews are fake!
3. Dr. Ju's customer service is not good. Impatient, trying to get the most out of a patient.
4. Not an expert on the equipment, but just know that there's no mouth-wash on each machine, which isn't really convenient.
5. No goggles to protect eyes every time for the bright light or from other stuff.</text>

<resp>{'time': 1623415535801, 'text': 'Hi M Welday, we have no patient by this name so we don\'t know who you are, and I don\'t remember any patient that left so unhappy to leave a 1 star review as we ask every patient, every visit how, everything went, but if you really are a patient here and had a bad experience, I\'m sorry you felt that way. Please call us so that we can find out how to make things right if we went wrong somewhere.\n\nBut to address some of your concerns:\n\n1. All the reviews are real. We have "a lot" for being open less than 2 years, compared to a 10 year old office, because reviews were not a thing 10 years ago so an old office doesn\'t necessarily translate to more reviews. Also, because a lot of things are digital and automated at our office including review invites, and because we\'re busy and a lot of patients get the auto invites, many do post their opinions, resulting in "a lot" of reviews. It\'s not unusual now days to see 500+ reviews on many new offices that have digital and automated forms and reminders, and review invites, unlike many 10 year old offfices.\n\n2. I\'m sorry you felt that I was impatient. Again, I have no idea who this is, so please call and I will apologize if I was. But no, we are not trying to get the most out of a patient. Rather, we really go out of our way sometimes to help and I take pride in that.\n\n3. We don\'t have a spit bowl next to each chair, which is a very old and unhygienic style, but we do have sinks to rinse. If you wanted to rinse, it doesn\'t make sense that we would have denied you.\n\n4. Goggles and Vaseline are offered, but yes sometimes we forget. But if people know about them, like you did, they can of course request it, and they would have been gladly offered.\n\nAgain, we cannot pull up your name in our system, nor truly rememer any one that left justifiably unhappy, but please call us so that we can find out who you are, how to make things right if we went wrong, and apologize.\n\nSincerely'}</resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>My wife went to Hello smile dental because she has have a tooth that is giving her pain. The whole experience from the time She walked  in the door until She left was positive. She have a lot of anxiety when it comes to seeing the dentist, Dr Ju put her at ease he explained everything he was doing every step of the way. He was even able to get her earlier than scheduled. I highly recommend this dental office.< /Review><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

I was having tremendous pain in one of my molars and the doctor answered the phone himself and got me in the same day!  He was kind and courteous and very affordable.  His waiting room is immaculate and beautifully decorated.  He was very patient with me and answered all of my questions.  I will never go anywhere else and I will recommend him to everyone.  It was the smoothest extraction that I have ever had and now I’m pain free!< /Review>< pictures>

I am usually very nervous at the dentist, but Dr. Ju was so welcoming and easy to talk to. The facility was very clean and simple to navigate. It was convenient that Dr. Ju uses an online service to fill out paperwork as well as check into your appointment. This saves a lot of time! His dental assist. was also super helpful and great to talk to. I am very happy with my time at Hello Smiles Dental and would recommend to anyone.< /review>< UserId.>

<text>My experience here reached beyond expectations. With many established dental offices booked out for months in the area, I decided to try somewhere new. Walking in the office was extremely clean with new equipment. Staff was very welcoming and friendly and made me feel comfortable. The whole process was tech savvy and made things run much smoother than other places I’ve been. Dr. Ju had my insurance ready before arrival and explained to me exactly what I would be paying before beginning any procedures. Will definitely be back and happy I found a new dentist!< /text><response>{'time': 1606353979831, 'text': 'Hi Jessica, we are so happy that we were able to take care of you.

Dr Ju is great!!   He is kind and caring with a gentle touch.
I had not been to a dentist in over 10 years,   I have never liked going to the dentist because of many not so great experiences.
I did not feel judged and he was able to do check up xrays, deep cleaning and multiple cavities, right away. He explained everything, showed me the pictures of my teeth and problem areas. He is so gentle I had not even realized he had started on the fillings.  Everything including the deep cleaning was painless.
I am excited to finally find a doctor that I am comfortable to go to and will be following up to make sure I take better care of my teeth. My husband has even more dental anxiety than I do and I will be making an appointment for him as well.
The office is beautiful, clean and with amazing technology.< /review>

I had such a good experience at Hello Smile. I needed alot of work, and they were so informative and fast and efficient. The office is beautiful and very comfortable, and they really tried to think of everything. I also really appreciated the measured they took to be conscious of the covid 19 precautions and still keep me comfortable. Wonderful experience and this will definitely be my dentist going forward.< /Text>

<review>I had a recent dental emergency with a wisdom tooth, Dr.Ju and his assistant went out of their way to help me after closing hours. The tooth extraction was painless and I was back at home with one less bothersome tooth in less than 45 minutes. His dental assistant was very nice, professional, and made me feel very comfortable.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Very personable dentist. Dr Ju was very relaxed and forth right with his diagnosis of my issue. He normally doesn't work on Saturdays because of the pandemic but made an exception for me. My family normally goes to Avenue Of Smiles but I'm going to switch over to Dr Ju.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I had gum pain and badly needed a deep cleaning.  Dr. Kevin set up the apt. for the next day, all of the paperwork was done online, and the work was done with a minimal amount of pain.  Overall, I would say I've never had a better dental experience.<//Review>

Let me start by saying I have had some pretty awful experiences at the dentist my whole life. This dentist is such a wonderful blessing. He's kind and caring and wants only the best for his patients. Amazing bedside manner. His office is fully equipped with state of the art equipment. He's completely competent in the services he offers. I suffer from severe anxiety and don't feel any anxiety when at this office. The environment is more than clean. He takes pride in his work and ensures his patients are well taken care of. I don't give praise lightly at all. I highly recommend this office to anyone and especially to those who have anxiety when it comes to dental work. I'm so glad I found this office and this dentist. I will be returning for different treatments I have needed for quite some time. Thank you so much for offering your services.<//review>

I was very impressed with Hello Smile Dental. The office Is brand new and super clean.  It has state of the art technology right in the office so you don’t have to go elsewhere for specialty procedures. Dr. Ju and his staff are very efficient and kind. I left the office with my teeth feeling clean and happy! I would definitely recommend Hello Smile Dental to friends and family.</Text>

My daughter complained of a sudden severe tooth ache yesterday. My husband found Dr. Ju through Yelp. Dr. Ju was able to see my daughter within 2 hours and did several dental works. We are very thankful for Dr. Ju and his staff for taking the time to treat my daughter in such a short notice.  I believe that we finally found our family dentist. We already scheduled our appointment as a family🤩.<//review>

<Text>Dr. Kevin Ju was referred to me by my wife who had significant dental work done. I am glad she did because the experience was excellent. First the facility is new,  spacious, clean, and incredibly modern. The technology and tools, and procedures are cutting edge delivering comfort, speed and quality. Dr. Ju was personable. I felt like we were long time friends at the end of the experience. He made me feel comfortable. Another cool feature was that the patient rooms had TV's on the wall and ceiling so I could watch Netflix during my procedure. If your not happy with your current dentist, and or your new to town and need to find a great dentist, then look no further. I recommend Dr. Ju.  His dental assistant was super friendly and supported me through the procedure as well. I was able to complete all my new patient information online in advanced to my appointment. That saved me a lot of time.<//Text>< Pictures>

My family has lived in Simi Valley for over 70 years and with 5 children in our family, then grandkids and great grandkids- that's a lot of visits to the dentist over the years! So, we have experience with many, many dental offices in Simi Valley. And Hello Smile Dental is 5 star: 1.) Office is new, clean and has up to date equipment. Other dental offices are so tired and run down looking. 2.) Staff is friendly, kind and make you feel welcome every time you walk in. Not just the first time you walk thru the door. 3.) Highly competent dentist. Dr Ju attended top rated dental schools and continues to educate himself to stay up to date. Dr Ju takes the time to listen to his patient's concerns, clearly explains the procedure and wants the best out outcome for his patients. Plus, he completes procedures quickly. I'm not a fan of going to the dentist, so the quicker I can be done and out the door, that's extra added bonus.
I myself have implants, enough crowns to be crowned a queen and too many filings to count by other dentists. Not all dentists are the same. Do yourself a favor and go see Dr Ju.</review>

<review>My dentist for over 20 years had retired.  Since I was getting tired of driving 30 miles to mid Valley, I decided to find a new dentist near from where I live.  I found Dr. Ju from Anthem's dentist list, first.  Then I googled him and found  more information.  His website provided all the information I was looking for; credentials, years of experience, etc.  And his office was only 10 miles away.  So, I decided to give him a try.  All the paperwork was done thru internet which could have saved at least 10-20 minutes at the office.  When I went there, I was greeted by a staff with temperature measurement which was expected under COVID-19 situation.  Office was almost brand new, clean and nice.  As a new patient, Dr. Ju performed full mouth exam including x-rays and picture taking.  Results were presented in detail by using a wall mounted HDTV/monitor.  I ended up getting one chipped filling patched and  4 notches filled.  The treatment was painless and I felt very comfortable.  Dr. Ju gave a personal attention and care, very friendly.  All in all, I found a new dentist!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
I gave them a four because they never offered a tv channel or music to listen to. I had a lot of anxiety. At one point I felt Dr Ju getting very frustrated,  and  it showed in his voice like he was angry.  it was ever so slightly, but I was very nervous and even a little bit of anger made me more anxious.

Because I wanted to stop, he suggested that next time I get Novocain so he could take the rest of that cement off. It almost sounded like a threat and I did not like that.

He took off his mask at one point when mine was off and that bothered me a lot.

The office was very clean. His dental assistant was very warm and comforting.

I think he could work on his genuine compassion. In the past  I’ve had dentists who are very warm with gentle demeanors. So, that is what I’m comparing him to.</Review>

<response>{'time': 1595881622976, 'text': "Hi Suzanne, I'm sorry no one offered you a TV channel.\n\nAnd I apologize if you felt at one point that I was angry at you but I was not at all. The only thing I could think about is that perhaps I was talking a bit louder when you were talking to me while I was working on your XRay images? I was faced away from you and had my mask on so I spoke a bit louder? Or was it when I spoke a bit louder when it gets noisy during the procedure? If so, I think it was a misunderstanding but I apologize if you felt that way.\n\nUsually we don't numb for the basic and routine procedure you got, but since it seemed you were more sensitive in that area, I offered numbing there. It wasn't a threat at all but simply an offer to not have you be sensitive. I honestly don't  know how that is a threat but if you took it that way, I'm sorry.\n\nBut yes, I did pull down my mask to my chin at one point for a few seconds. I though I wasn't explaining well, so in an attempt to rephrase, I pulled it down for that moment as a knee-jerk reaction. We both should have had our masks on at that time. Sorry about that as well. Once I saw that you put your mask back on, I pulled mine up also.\n\nWe strive to provide a good experience here and I'm sorry it didn't meet your expectations Suzanne. I appreciate your feedback."}</response><Gmap_id>0x80e829b3044e875b:0x23bcf7dd53215700<//Gmap_id></record>

I've followed Kevin Ju around from his early days as a dentist and he is by far the most thorough and complete dentist I and my family have used.  I go to him for teeth cleanings... and a filling.  No pain and he gets it done right the first time. Very professional.< /Review>

My visits with Dr. Kevin Ju was very comfortable and his work is absolutely top notch.  My family will start going to Dr. Kevin Ju from now on.  I am a cash pay customer and his prices out beat all of the dentist that i have been to. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Kevin Ju.< /Text>

Dr. Ju has been treating my family for years.  Never a bad experience.  Dr. Ju is highly qualified, experienced, and most importantly honest.  He's just a good person to trust.  You'll never second guess his recommendations or treatment.< /review>

Super happy Dr. Ju is opening his own office in Simi Valley. I've had him as my dentist before at another office and he was so great, I've been trying to find him since then. Really gentle, and has such a disarming, kind demeanor. I'm making an appointment as soon as he opens! Thanks again Dr. Ju, you're the best.< /text>

Dr. Ju helped me overcome my fear of going to the dentist. He answered all my questions, and explained everything in detail so I knew what was going on. He is very skilled at what he does, and I know I can trust him. Dr. Ju is great!< /review>

Always have had anxiety with Dentists! Dr Ju is patient and kind and always makes my nerves at ease. He’s also great with my daughter! I used to travel all the way to Lancaster to see him! He’s THAT worth it! To my absolute delight I found out he’s going to now be in my local town of Simi Valley. Do not hesitate to make an appointment with Dr Ju! He’s very detailed and all the work he’s done is done with precision and care. See you soon Dr. Ju</review>

Terrible pain from a cracked tooth and Dr. Ju saw me right away. Quickly and painlessly gave me a crown with which I have had no problems with since. Great dentist!< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>I just booked my first appointment with Hello Smile Dental. The Reserve An Appointment link is very easy to use. I simply clicked the link, selected new patient, viewed all openings, chose an available date and time convenient for me, filled in basic appointment and patient info, and scheduled the appointment with a simple click of a button.

Not only is the online appointment process stress-free, but it is also secure. Once my appointment was scheduled, a message came up on the screen asking me to verify my email address by opening the message from my inbox, and clicking verify.

Once verified, I was able to enter additional insurance information as an option for speedier service. I was also able to easily add the appointment to my calendar.

If you’re like me, and prefer typing things out digitally, rather than writing on paper forms at the office, I highly recommend using the online appointment feature. It is super easy and convenient. If you want, you can also download their free dental mobile app, Modento.

With regards to Dr. Kevin Ju, he was my dentist for years. The only reason I lost contact was because the distance was too far. Needless to say, distance is no longer an issue. He is NOW in my hometown, Simi Valley, CA, conveniently located on Los Angeles and Erringer in the Smart & Final Plaza!!!

I remember Dr. Ju to be a very competent and professional dentist. I never had any major issues. He really took care of my pearly whites!

I’m glad he’s my dentist again!<//Text><user_name>D O</user_name>< gmap_id>

<Text>My family to moved to Porter Ranch about a year ago and we've been looking for a dentist.  We are so glad that we've found Dr. Ju!  As soon as you walk into Hello Dental you will be greeted by a friendly receptionist in a spacious, comfortable, and clean lobby.  The office is equipped with the latest technology including a CT scan.  Beyond the new machines, however, Dr. Ju is a top-notch dentist. I appreciated his thorough examination and his taking time to explain the health of my teeth and gums using the pictures of the inside of my mouth projected to the big screen TV.  By the way, I've never seen pictures of my teeth that close up...kinda cool!  Once the procedures began, he was patient and meticulous and I left the office with no pain and discomfort, just a big smile.  Thank you, Dr. Ju and staff!

Pros:
- Dr. Ju's professionalism and competency
- Friendly and helpful staff
- Newest technology
- CT scan on site
- Ample parking<//Text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been to about five dentists: some were okay, some were bad. Dr. Ju seems better than them in terms of diagnostic capabilities. He’s also pretty quick to adapt his behavior to make the patient feel more comfortable. He listened to my questions and answered them in a clear and practiced manner. His assistant has an extremely nurturing, consistent approach; if you have children, this is probably something you want.

I’m quite satisfied with the whole experience. I would recommend him, if you’re looking for a dentist.< /text>

<Review>This place is absolutely delicious. I go here with my coworkers at least twice a week and we always get the lunch special. I have never tried Indian cuisine before. But I am glad I did here!!!! Satisfying my taste buds every time.

Not a huge menu but you will have plenty of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. Nice service, gives an mid upscale vibes.

Only down side is they don’t take reservation and they have small sitting area, feels like you are Manhattan! ( I understand finding a big place in Las Gatos is a challenge). Don’t go with big party! Else you may to wait forever.</review>< pics>

<review>How can you share your experience when your order was delivered to the wrong place and the restaurant took their phone off the hook so you nor Grubhub can get ahold of them to redo the order? What an irresponsible restaurant. You don’t deserve to be in business. Never again. I would add a photo but as our dinner never arrived, there’s no photo to post!<//review>< Response>

< Review>
We went to this place on Friday for lunch. It is a small gem in las Gatos. We really enjoyed the food. Their preparation was really good and very tasty. Food quantity was decent too. Service was on point. We would definitely visit again and would sure recommend this place to friends & family.
Ps- They have a small seating area and most of the time they are full so if you are planning to go this place specially on a weekend, you may want to book a table in advance.<//Review>

A small Indian restaurant with a lovely decor, and great burst of flavors. Try the cauliflower for appetizers, something different than the samosas you always order. 😉

For entrées, try the a Hari tandoori vegetables - the portions are good sized, you can share. The dal makhani and shrimp curry are also yummy.

The potato and peas kulcha is also a must order. The entrées come with rice.< /text>

Exceptionally good Indian cooking. Happy food!
Very, very well made rack of lamb, good stews, and interesting appetizers. Traditional Indian sauces are superb!

The place is always crowded after 6 pm. Service is prompt even at the busy time.

The only drawback - the carryout folks need to walk across the dining area, and that makes already small place too busy with people, less inviting..</review>

<pics>None</pics><name>Charu Madan< /name><Review>The place hit the mark for awesome Indian food (which sadly is hard to find in bay area, plenty of Indian places, but good ones, ahem!!) Thats why the 5 stars. They were fairly busy when we got there and have their tables is separate with plexi glass. They dont have a lot of room, but they were gracious to accommodate us in the patio next door and got everything set up very quickly!  Brajesh who was our server was awesome and took great care of us, even though they were short staffed and were really busy! There was another guy Ayush who also was amazing and made sure we were comfortable. So just for their customer service they receive top points!
Now to the food, here are the top picks:
1- The Seabass Tikka from the clay oven was a big HIT with the family! it was polished off in no time, so could not get any pictures. 5 stars!
2- The Malai kofta - delicious. Malai Kofta is like a paneer based dumpling swimming in a creamy cashew based tomato sauce. Its a bit like Butter Chicken/ CTM sauce. 5 stars for that too for vegetarians
3- CTM- Again the family loved it and polished it off in no time. 5 stars
4- Paneer Tikka from Clay Oven- this one I would say the least spectacular and was just meh. Not bad if you are looking for a paneer fix, but not the best. 4 stars
5- Now to the Naans, the butter and garlic naans were fresh and delish. But the STAR was Cheese Kulcha!! Highly highly recommend. 5 stars.

Do check out this place for great Indian fare!< /Review>< Response>

Our first time coming to this little restaurant. Being busy on a Thursday night gave the obvious impression that this place must be good, and indeed it was. Attentive service, great food at a great price. And by the way, clean. This is definitely our favorite Indian restaurant.<//review>

< review>
We enjoyed our visit to Namaste.  The service was prompt and the meals were full of authentic flavors.  Enjoyed the decor.  We were moved during the meal to accompany a bigger party that arrived and were happy to do so since it is a small size space.  The waiter was kind enough to offer us each another drink.  I did find the Chicken to be a little below what I would expect.  I do understand that Thigh Meat is the best to retain flavor, however my particular serving wasn't great.   The second visit with friends a week later proved otherwise.  Thank you!</review>

I had to tell them that I would like to eat here. More silence. I then said where should I sit and a man pointed at a table and said sit there.
Service was disappointing already but I tried to make the best of it hoping that the food would make up for it. Unfortunately the food did not live up to my expectations. The chicken had crissle and wasn't really cut up it was kind of torn off and just thrown into the curry. I couldn't even finish the chicken because I wanted to spit it into my napkin due to the cartilage.
The display of the food looked nice but it was just bland.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I was surprised by the quality of food here. My coworkers and I went for lunch and had some of the best Indian food any of us have eaten for a long time. This is a small restaurant, so be sure to plan in advance or it could be difficult to get in. I am pleased to have this gem in our neighborhood!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Food was fantastic, as well as the service. Very cozy, personal atmosphere inside. Our waiter, Eeyush, was extremely attentive and friendly! Will definitely be returning whenever I'm around Los Gatos!< /review>

<Text>Very pleasantly surprised how good this place is! Out walking in Los Gatos with my wife around lunchtime and feeling hungry, we found ourselves by Namaste. Stepping inside, it was small but had 3 or 4 empty 'tables-for-two' so we sat down. The waiter quickly came and presented lunch menus and filled our glasses with chilled water. We both ordered chicken tikka masala with mild spices and it seemed like only a few minutes wait before they were on our table. Along with the chicken, the meal included rice, salad, nan bread, yoghurt dip, lentils, and a small, sweet rice dessert. Very tasty and filling, and all for a reasonable cost. We'll certainly visit Namaste again and recommend to friends.< /Text>< Pics>

I ordered Butter Chicken, Saag Paneer, and Vegetable Samosas. It was not bad, but I've had better. I also thought the prices were too high. I'll probably try someplace else next time.</Review>

<Text>Overall, promising.  It's FABULOUS that they have a children's menu - one big disappointment was that the chicken in the children's butter chicken was very gristly/fatty/hard and simply consisted of low-quality chicken. I'm all for dark meat, but quality.  The flavor of the sauce was perfect. Other dishes (palak paneer, cheese naan, chicken tikka masala) were all super-strong.  In short - don't feed the kids poor quality stuff - and you'll be a strong 5 stars.</Text><date>1568398190549<//date><name>Suzanne Frey< /name></record>

I was hoping the paneer tikka masala was gonna taste authentic.. This place got good reviews so I figured I would give it a try. I think this is more of a indian chain food restaurant then a home cooked kind of indian restaurant.</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Decided to come for lunch.  Food was delicious and fresh.  Service was quick, friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed a milk tea boba drink with our food.  My husband got a noodle dish and I got a rice bowl dish called bibimbap.  We also got some delicious desserts to go.  I would like to come back and try some of their other desserts.  I just wish the parking was better here.  We found a parking spot easily this visit but sometimes it's hard to find a spot.  Plus all spaces are tiny.</review>< Rating>

< Review>
I love the desserts here! But the lady there was not much help I asked her about this dessert and wats it like when it's hot and she kept saying "Americans like it cold Hong Kong ppl like it hot" I mean okay. What does it taste like is it like carnation milky or shaved ice cream? I dnt wanna hear about how the Americans like it just the taste of the dessert I give this place a 4 because of the fact that she kept sayings "THE AMERICANS" she's in america right? But hey the food here is great!! So must try guys!! Probley will get a better first time experience T_^ #lmao #yummy #omgosh #AMERICANS< /Review>

4/5 for the flower pot tiramisu: a unique take on the trend of potted plant boba. It comes with a shovel spoon and a cute little pot. I tried the green tea and a bit of the classic tiramisu and both had good flavor and were also nice and fluffy. The Oreo was a good complement and finely crushed. It is a pretty small dessert.

On the other hand, the other dessert and boba I tried weren't that great. I tried a normal milk tea with crystal boba and the tea was just ok, a little too much milk in proportion. The boba was too chewy and not that tasty. I also tried the lychee jasmine milk tea pudding and it was disappointing. For one it seems reasonable to assume that you can take the jar home but it costs an additional $.50. They should have put that on the menu at least. The jelly wasn't that good, although the pudding was delicious. It was a split dessert.

I'd only suggest getting the tiramisu pot here.< /Text>

The tech arrived on time, and identified the problem with the dishwasher quickly. As they said the services call fee was counted to the total repair cost, and the repair cost was reasonable. Now my dishwasher is functioning properly. Thanks BAY MASTER APPLIANCE</text>

Extremely professional and very responsive. The part to be replaced was no longer being manufactured, they did the research to find options and order the relevant parts/ replacement. Followed all Covid safety protocols, was very efficient and reasonable.

<Review>*After having you come to our home 3 times, we know we booked with your company. Our washer has the same intermittent problem it had before you replaced parts. This means it was not fixed. It also means that we paid for an expensive device, you didn’t make good on your promise to not pay if it’s not fixed. The many times I’ve called with no response means you are unwilling to make it right. I can post receipts if you would like. Thank you though for responding to my review.

We called for a our dryer which was squealing when in use. Their price was high but it was fixed same day. Our washer was having problems so for double what we paid for our dryer, they order parts, we waited quite a while for them and they “fix” our washer. It continued to have problems. They said they would come back as many times as it would take to fix. I felt relieved. They ordered more parts and when they came to “fix” they explained/lectured me on how to use my washer. I tried to explain what was still happening, but got a lecture on the use of it again. When they left, the next load I washed experienced the same problem again! I tried calling several times with no answer and you can’t leave a msg. I called from a work phone and when I told my problem was still happening, I was lectured again on how to use my washer. I was told they’d already replaced parts and they would have to review their records. No call back. So 2 days later I finally get through again. They tell me they will get back to me, but don’t. I have called many more times as my washer still doesn’t work right. So much for their promise of coming until it was fixed! I paid them enough to buy a new, nice model, and still mine is not working right. I wouldn’t recommend or use them again! Very condescending when I tried to talk about fixing it!< /Review>< pictures>

Based on your explanation, I may guess that you booked with someone else. We do not charge your customers if a machine is not fixed. It is either fixed or there is no charge, regardless of how much work or effort was put into it and there is usually a service warrant on any work performed.\n\nMeanwhile, customers get a confirmation text once they have booked a service with us and they can communicate with us through that phone number and we keep record of the communication.\n\nplease contact me at 4083625684, and I will look into your case myself.

Great service! On time, very professional and extremely responsive. Our dishwasher was broken for more than 2 months. The home depot warranty  and their service provider delayed the repair for 2 months and could not even fix the issue. I called bay master to fix it. They sent a technician the next day itself and he fixed the issue in just 2 hours. Technician's name was Muneer.  He was a thorough professional. He even cleaned all the parts of my dishwasher. I highly recommend this place!</Text>

Excellent experience. I called in the morning and they were there in the afternoon, right on time. My dryer was making a grinding noise. They diagnosed the problem, fixed and it works great. Price was reasonable and they were nice enough to offer me a discount because I am a first responder .Very refreshing (after so many bad experiences) to find someone who is competent, reasonably priced and available.

Update from 8/13:

Shortly after my dryer broke my washer also broke. Because these guys did such an amazing job with the dryer I called them again. I had the same repairman (his name is Nas) and he was once again amazing. Professional, easy to work with, competent. He arrived on time, identified the problem, was excellent when it came to Covid safety measures. Ask for him, though I suspect the whole crew is probably good from what I have seen. I have had so many bad experiences over the years it is hard to say how happy I am to finally find a good repair company.< /text>

The service person arrived on schedule and had the part to replace a switch.  He then spent much time on a problem that I didn't know the appliance had.<//Text>

Charged $75 for diagnoses which goes toward repair if you accept. The total cost of repair was $325 and I accepted. The fridge was not fixed and still didnt get cold. I contacted them and within a few days they did come back to check it for free. They realized the fan was also not working and said if we replaced that too it would work and they would only charge me for the part. I oaid for part which was another $120 which seemed high but it did work after that and get plenty cold now.< /Review>< Pics>

{'time': 1606929993829, 'text': "Thank you Anthony for your business. We usually do not replace all the relevant  parts in appliance to fix a fault to make sure the repair is affordable.  Sometime, there could be a secondary issue that won't be detected until we have fixed the first problem. Also, there might be a part that is not working properly that we try to fix for you instead of replacing it; again, to save you money. But it it turns out it is not holding or does not get the results we want, the next step is to show without any service call fee or repair labor fee. All you pay for is the part that you can purchase yourself as well if you choose to.  Best"}<//resp>

Saee arrived on time and was professional, courteous, skilled, and efficient. He immediately identified the problem and showed it to me. We discussed the solution and the cost, and it was reasonable.

<date>1596227425889< /date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Bay Master Appliance Services was easy to work with mainly due to their service worker, Nas.  He was amazing.  He was knowledgeable, considerate, efficient, offered very good details regarding the issue and what needed to happen next.  We needed to order a part and I had done research prior to contacting Bay Master Appliance and knew the cost of the part we needed.  The mark-up was extremely high, but I was allowed to order the part myself and have Nas return to install it.  I ended up paying extra for them to order it just to save about a week delivery time.  So far the refrigerator filter is still holding and we are hopeful that the repair is long term.  However, I also know that LG has had issues with this particular part so we'll cross our fingers!!  Thank you, Nas!!< /Text>< pics>

Bag area appliance was the only one to treat me like a human being. I live in Pleasanton and wanted a leaking fridge repaired ASAP. No body was willing to come out the same day. While other repair companies were being so robotic with their approach, Jay promised that someone would come and get this situation taken care of even though they did not service the Tri Valley area. I was very very grateful! Highly recommend them!</text>

<Review>A week before Thanksgiving and our stove stops working. I called the manufacturer and was told it's no longer under warranty. Of course, bc that's my kind of luck. I checked repair Co. in my area and read the reviews. Most 4 or 5 star ratings, but only had 2 or 3 reviews. But BMA services had a lot of great reviews, so I called and they showed in within a hour and 20 minutes later it was fixed. They charge a $49. fee to come out look at it, and that amount went towards the repair. Great job. Will definitely recommend to friends and will definitely call again if anything else goes wrong with any other appliances. Thank BMA.</Review>< Pics>

These guys are champions. They know how to go the extra mile in customer service. I live far away and it’s very difficult to get service to my area. They were able to work with me to repair several appliances I’ve needed to repair for a long time. A dryer, washer, refrigerator, ice maker, and garbage compactor!

Perhaps if these guys can’t fix it... it can’t be fixed!

Warning to all customers in the Sacramento area, this company's tech's are not company employees, independent contractors. The tech that came to our house doesn't have a service truck or any parts, not even a hose clamp. First visit is diagnostic only, then order parts fron Amazon. 3 days later come back and fix. The tech misdiagnosed and was going to order more parts. Piss poor way to run a company.</Text>

One of the authentic place to have gujrathi thali. Good and tasty food, while the service is a little slow but the best part is quality of food which takes the upper hand. The staff is friendly. Will recommend n return again<//Review>

A good Indian and vegetarian restaurant, with the regional cuisine of the state of Gujarat - the state of "Mahatma" Gandhi. The food is served quickly and is good quality and quantity. I had a large thali, but will probably get the smaller one next time.<//text>

<review>The food is average here...average taste and average variety....but it's expensive. On top of that they prefer cash...if you want to use credit card they will charge extra.

It was more of mess hall kind of feeling. Will not come back again.</review><rating>2< /rating><name>Brijesh Yadav</name><date>1518205623454<//date>< Resp>

<Review>Hopeless service...Jains be aware don’t ever visit as  u will be served with limited variety compare to regular Veg...
We went as a group of 21 People...4 of us were Jain...
Rest of the people were served with Undhiyo & Aloo ka Subji & Paneer Subji...
But disappointment was for Jain people who were served With only cabbage Subji & Rajma, that too was tasteless...kadhi was as good as chaas...
Please don’t visit them in Weekends as their service is hopeless, we have to wait for roti, appetisers & subji for 5/10 min...Everyone was annoyed....
While giving payment, I had kept their cover ready...My sixth sense was saying me that they will do some mischief & they did...They told me 10$ are short...I had arguments but I didn’t  want to fight with them....I had to pay them....
Very Bad experience....Our Mother’s Day Lunch was spoiled...We ended up paying more & getting substandard quality & service...They charge bomb but give u peanuts...<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Ok food. Too Sweet with lots of added sugar or other sweetner.
No variety to offer.
Lunch and dinner same items.
Even though there is a sign about giving suggestions being new owner, when suggestion is given, it was rudly rejected. Oh and flies roaming around to join u for food.<//text>< gmapID>

The pooris (4) and the curries (2) were good.  The sweet was just too less, just enough for a single bite.  Same with the raita.  The dal was good but was a little  sweet.  Quantity of rice could be a little more.< /Review>

THEY HAVE CLOSED THIS PLACE PERMANENTLY.
Good food..
Delhi chaat and Dahi Sev Puri were great!
Authentic Gujarati style... Slightly on the sweeter side .. But taste is very good.
Service can be a bit slow at times when it is crowded</Review>

I find that a lot of people will eat pretty much anything.  And for them, this place is probably great.  But if you're interested in a meal that makes sense to eat, I'd skip this place.  The Bhel out here is like no other - it has no potatoes, onions or chutney.  Only puffed rice and sev served in a styrofoam box.  Their sev puri was even worse, and doesn't deserve space on here. I'm glad they took my order back and refunded my money.  Plus the guys making the food looked like they hadn't showered in weeks.<//Review>

< Review>
Being Navratri it was about time to try vegetarian specialities and on a friends suggestion went over to this one for an authentic gujrati Thali experience. This place is located right in front of Red-chillies in Milpitas on a strip mall. It's a typical gujrati restaurant with around 70 people seating area, carrying some snacks, preferring cash payments & hand written daily specials on the board. We went in and ordered couple thalis, it comes with Rotis / Rice / Daal (Gujrati version) / Undiyo / Bhaji / Raita / Chole / Mutiya and mango cream. Rotis were very tasty prfectly soft and fresh, Mutiya and Bhaji were also amazingly awesome, chole was not spicy enough so did not entice my taste bud that much, was trying undiyo for the 1st time so kind of 50-50 in taste. I personally liked the daal it was kind of tangy with some peanuts thrown in, went good with rice.
They serve the food in plastic plates kind of easy to dispose. Overall, I liked the food quality and taste as it acted as a good alternative for my non-veg addicted tongue.<//Review>

One Thali costed $ 10.99  and it did not have enough of anything ( Worst taste)

There was Kheer in the Sweet ( let say 20 ML ) and that too without Rice.

They will charge 75 Cents if you use your credit card to pay ( I did not see any other Indian Restaurant which charge this kind of money).

When you pay by Cash , they charge you 3 $ extra as taxes..

So the only motivation behind their restaurant is to earn money and they do not concentrate on quality.

When we complained about the quality of food , the person on the reception was RUDE and suggested us not to come back again.

My Suggestion , IF YOU DONT VALUE YOUR MONEY , PLEASE GO THERE.

THANKS..<//Text>

THE BEST medical dispensary in long beach. amazing deals right here every single day! (They got 10% off all vapes right now!) Its a very clean shop. besides that they always got good vibes going with the best customer service! I love coming here. There are so many flower options to choose from. They have the best strains in the South Bay. You will definitely find something you like here! If you are in the Carson/Torrance then don’t miss out.<//text>

Great service! The staff was very attentive. Answered questions as they came. You actually get to see the product up face and smell it. Lol. It’s low key. They make you feel exclusive. First timers get things it’s awesome here< /Text>

I’ve been coming here for a while now and it’s always been super dope and informative coming here. Honestly the weeds really good and I always seems to arrive at happy hour! Haha they usually have blue dream (my favorite) so that keeps me coming back. Luna helped me out and has a bubbly personality. Made it super easy to shop comfortably, I didn’t feel like I was getting hounded the way I do at other shops. Definitely gonna keep coming back 👍🏼< /text>

<review>I just started coming here and j absolutely love it! Not only are they knowledgeable, kind, but they have great service and competitive prices. They always have great patient appreciation days, daily deals and happy hour; which really gives you a bang for your buck! They even have a great celebration/pricing on 420 (4/20). Needless to say this place is conveniently placed in the cut, priced very well, quick,  friendly with QUALITY product. Thanks for keeping me stocked and taken care of!!< /review><Date>1618364700977<//Date><UserId.>116819811189171502704< /UserId.><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

Extremely welcoming environment. Great service, good product. Nothing to complain about. No bait and switch by advertising pre tax price. Definitely the new spot in Torrance Carson area. Second time here and for sure will be back here again especially tomorrow for that five gram eighth. Best wax deals today 10% off and couple dollars off their best wax brand</text>

Cool lowkey place, came here as a recommendation from a friend was not disappointed. Came in for a plug n play battery and they had many colors and options available. Staff was really friendly and recommended so many things. They helped me get sorted for a sesh later tonight.</Review>

By far the greatest dispensary in the southbay. Copped some dank strawberry cough today and I love the new stiizy resins. The staff here is much more polite oppose you surround shops.

Mya and Sam were super dope and they even invited me to the shops Patient Appreciation Day on the 28th, I’m hella excited to come back!! 😝<//review>

<review>I stopped by this dispensary as a first timer a couple days ago, having hella questions bc I’m a newbie. The staff was so friendly! Robin helped me out and I found that the level of knowledge she had of the products was amazing! I left there with an empty wallet but it was definitely worth it. Recommend 10/10 .</review>< GmapID>

This is definitely the best dispensary in South Bay. Staff is always friendly and I’ve been coming for years now and refuse to go elsewhere. Not only is the service excellent the flower and wax are the best. Thank you South Bay Church for all you do.<//text>

<text>One of the best cannabis dispensaries in the south bay and Los Angeles. High quality flower, as well as vapes and stiiizys. I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't like their current dispensary and is looking for a good deal. Awesome happy hours as well as daily deals rock. Got that free gram on top of my five grams today. Always hooking it up here at South Bay church . Look forward to appreciation days too with Loads of extra goodies. Located in torrance ca 🤗. Moving out of Los Angeles going to miss this place so much!! Still highly recommend to anyone needing a dispensary you can trust!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd0PL1908ScEEzmGJ1TTN-GXT2nmqMGBsJq7Do=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1611074250849, 'text': "HEY CODY THANKS FOR STOPPING BY WE'RE GLAD YOU ENJOYED YOUR EXPERIENCE, WE HOPE TO SEE YOU BACK SOON.

<review>Best dispensary in the Torrance/Carson area. They have Stiiizy live resin carts, see two cards, lotto cards, I truly couldn’t decide so I had to get them all! And this is just half of their selection, they even have plug-and-play, Dime carts, Madres and more. This is a one stop shop for me because even the bud is fire! I don’t even mind driving 20 minutes to get there because they never disappoint! Thank you Southbay!!!<//review>< rate>

She didn’t make it seem like she was just trying to sell to to me, she was really cool. When I asked her about the exclusive shelf, she had an answer for everything and even gave her honest opinions.

Came to this dispensary in Torrance today and they really hooked it up ! Got a five gram eigth with some fire edibles included. Great customer service my bud tender Vinny really knew what he was talking about. And suggested the best flower that they got which is on their exclusive shelf. You can never go wrong with a five gram eigth lol. I’m for sure coming by again on Thursday for another one and I’m going to bring some friends by. Great vibes in here and very clean shop!<//Review>

The staff has always been welcoming and inviting when you come here. Always great options when you walk in. Being from Charleston, SC; and now living in Cali, I purchase the strains that look cartoonish. I always have to leave a tip after purchasing because I know I'll be back soon.

If you’re looking for the best dispensary in Torrance, Carson area then I highly recommend South Bay Church!

Been a few times to this dispensary and it’s becoming one of my favorite places. From the moment you enter you can feel such good vibrations. The bud-tenders are super friendly and attentive also. The shop has an excellent selection of strains as well as daily deals. They informed me about customer appreciation day on the 15th of this month, which I’m super ecstatic about. I highly recommend this place!<//Text>

First time here and I’ll for sure be coming back with some friends! I got hooked up with some fire indica 🔥 I appreciate how much the budtender told me about my purchase. I walked out knowing so much more just about weed in general. I always go to shops around here but this shop is now my favorite now thank u South Bay church appreciate it! Will be back soon :))< /review>

I was helped by gio his customer service is terrific, he’s honest with his suggestions and doesn’t try to make more out of you. I had questions and you can tell he was confident in what he was saying he recommended a golani joint and it’s been my favorite ever since! Thank you! Definitely recommending.< /text>

Love the wide selection in the shop. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. Every time I come in the shop I see people cleaning, which is appreciated in times like these. The plug and play is the best pen they have. I always come in to pick up exclusive flower but the bud tenders put me on to edibles and vapes! Keep it up South Bay church!</review>

This is the only dispensary I come to. I live in Long Beach and I drive almost every 2 days just to come here. I wouldn’t go anywhere else. Everyone is always so nice n friendly here, everytime i think I have a favorite employee someone else helps me with the same energy as the last one I love it here! Also they are very clean and I see they are constantly cleaning and disinfecting. I’m big on germs and I see they are always on it and that’s why I need coming back. Not to mention the cannabis here is the BEST IN TORRANCE AREA. thank you girls for always being so nice. I’ll be back in 2 days.<//Review>

This dispensary has the best deals on bud. I came into a vibrant environment. BTs are very nice and knowledgeable. They gave me a free gram and a half for their Patients Application Day. They also hooked me up with some fire pre rolls. I will definitely be back with some of my friends!</Text>

I’m so happy I did cause they have everything a stoner needs. They have wraps, bongs, & my favorite white recluse joints. They are also having Patient appreciation day on Thursday 01/21/21 so stop on by for amazing deals! Thank you for your help. I can’t wait to try my STNDRD edibles & my exclusive Indica. FYI if you bring your friend with you, you can get a 5G eighth! I’ll most definitely be back!< /text><date>1611190088451< /date>< Rate>

Great dispensary in Torrance/Carson area I found them on weedmaps. I was looking for a close shop nearby and it was literally 10 min from my house.They got daily deals here and they are the best. I’m always here on sundays and fridays for ounces but today I got my 10% of my stiiizy. Love the new live resins one great wax quality and great taste! I’ll for sure be back this Thursday for that 5 gram 8th always hooking it up here thanks Sbc!< /text>

Was kindly grated by the whole staff as I walked in, the vibes at this spot are on point. The bud tender sold me on their King Louie. Since I came on Friday I got 10% off my ounce. This is my new weed spot. I just tried the STNDRD Gummies they sell and they hit! I’m definitely going back for more. They have happy hour everyday with an extra gram on anything over an 8th. These days going to the dispo  is the highlight of my week, and I’m so stoked I found South Bay church. The product, the people and the speedy process really show at this shop.

<Text>This my fav new weed store! Tons of cannabis concentrates extracts and wax. My bud tender Alyssa put me on to the CBD living gummies and I’m giving them as gifts for my family for Christmas. The SKYWALKER was fire and they had a 10g special. They’ve always got deals going on AND they give you a free joint or dab when you spend a certain amount. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

They have all the popular products like stiiizy, plug n to play and dime! They have a wide variety of cannabis flower like   MARATHON OG and Kush glue, they also have a great rating on weed maps, so if your looking for a dispensary near coast mesa come see this shop !!!

This my fav new weed store! Tons of cannabis concentrates extracts and wax. My bud tender Alyssa put me on to the CBD living gummies and I’m giving them as gifts for my family for Christmas. The SKYWALKER was fire and they had a 10g special. They’ve always got deals going on AND they give you a free joint or dab when you spend a certain amount. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</Review>

There’s a lot of different cannabis strains to choose from and the budtender was really helpful picking out jars from the type of weed I said I liked so the customer service is really good too. Very nice vibe inside, feels very welcoming. If you’re looking for a new cannabis dispensary to go to in Torrance I recommend this one!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd35a84b7c2663:0x509c8bfbb3631c93<//Gmap_id></record>

My go to spot.
Tons of selections and tiers to pick from.
All different types of varieties of flower and the staff has always been very friendly and attentive the moment you walk in through the door.
Small hidden gem but have been consistent the entire year I've been coming here and thats why i continue to shop here even though I live a bit farther.
Definitely check this place out for your herbal needs!< /review>

<Review>South Bay church is the best dispensary near me. The flower on their exclusive shelf is always fire. Can’t wait to try premium sky walker and king glue. I’ve been looking for plug and play carts everywhere and they always have the best flavors! Also ask about their deals on stiiizy cause they do different ones al the time!! Also best customer service! Love all the bud tenders<3</Review><rate>5< /rate><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

South Bay is a fire shop. Their plug and plays are super tasty and a decent price. I came in only for Cbd but the female behind the counter recommended these vape cartridges and I'm glad she did. Thanks for all the help. Check them out if you haven't.</text>

<Review>Best experience at a cannabis dispensary that I’ve ever been to. I went in because they had a sale on Stiiizy! I had gone to a couple of cannabis shops are in the Torrance area i’m so glad I found this one.I also saw that it was top rated on weed maps and I thought I’d give it a shot. They have a really good first time patient deal and they hooked me up they care of the usual Skywalker oG , King Louie, A wide variety of CBD products They also carry a lot of cannabis edibles brownies cookies cupcakes and even syrup. I will definitely be back to customer service was amazing anyway but tinder was very knowledgeable and recommended me some products that I’ve never had before thank you to South Beach church cannabis dispensary for helping me out today I will be back soon<//Review>< Pics>

Im not from around town but I love coming through to this shop when I visit. They got early and late happy hour which is super convenient. Mondays they give you a deal on your vapes as well which is dope. They are always pretty stocked up on their products so it's cool to have options.</review>

The budtender was super knowledgeable and wasn't annoyed at all the question i had asked. I tend to be picky when choosing my weed and they had so many bomb options so it was nice to have a real opinion and it's dope they actually smoke the cannabis they sell and use the products the sell.< /review>< Pics>

This is my favorite shop to stop by on my way and from work. They always have the best selection of flower and vapes. I always leave with more than what I went for, kinda like s Target for cannabis. You walking just to buy a gram but leave with an Oz, a new vaped and some edible you never thought you wanted but needed to try.<//Text>

So happy they finally got plug n plays, plus I get hooked up on Monday with their 10% off deal on carts. They got all the flavors too, girl scout cookie and just jack. Nothing but fire weed and a great options to choose from. The vibes are always great and the medtenders are very knowledgeable with the and cbd.</Review>

This place has some of the best bud at the best prices, no getting over charged for weed just cause it’s in a glass jar. When you come to South Bay Church you get exactly what you paid for<//review>

Came in on patient appreciation day for the 5 gram 8th and had a great experience! The shop was super clean and all staff was wearing masks and gloves. They also had a b2g1 on the stiiizys which was clutch :) my bud tender Ramen hooked it up and let me know about all the deals, I’ll be back for the next P.A.D to get the CBD oils she recommended!<//text>

<text>Ok first off, thank you for finally giving Torrance the cannabis needs we were lacking . I’ve recently been trying some new spots & this is by far the best quality and pricing I have found. They sell quarters, half’s, ounces and actually give you give you a value and cost savings. Unlike other shops in the area that only sell you 1/8ths so they maximize their profits. I got a half of some good buds for much less than I would pay any where else and the quality is amazing. I was helped out by Jas, she was great and so was the rest of the staff.. by far the best in Torrance. This staff did not come to play to dominate the market. If you are a local competitor I recommend learn fast before they put you out of business. Service and quality is what keeps me coming back. Keep it up< /text>< Pics>

This dispensary is my favorite by far. They have the nicest tenders in Torrance. I’ve never been to a dispensary like this one everyone inside was so friendly and helpful the vibes were great. Shoutout to the young lady who helped me find exactly what I needed. She hooked me up with the best cannabis I’ve had in a long time! Idk what it is but I haven’t smoked good weed like this in a while so I’m every thankful!!  I also got hooked up with a free edible and joint when I bought an oz of there best stuff!! Once again thanks sbc I love it here and I forsure will be back again for the 5gram 8th on the 12!!!!<//review>

I came to this dispensary earlier and it was a real coo shop . There was a kid in their name bone and he knew the cannabis that I wanted. All the budtenders were very alive and full of energy I loved it , the deals were poppin and today they blessed me with some edibles so it was a great day , I highly recommend you guys go there and shop the deals are amazing and the budtenders are better than most shops I have seen .< /Text>

While all the other dispensaries have been closing South Bay Church stands supreme! I’ve been coming here for a while now and it’s the best Carson/Torrance has to offer. The product here are of good quality, have never had a problem with any shelf & the pricing matches! With multiple Patient Appreciation days a month, SBC really knows how to treat their members to goodies. SBC offers cannabis products as well as a CBD selection. I’ve been bringing friends here over the last few months and they all agree to love SBC. Usually open from 8AM for the early tokers and closing at midnight for the last-minute sessions, this location is all that and MORE!<//Text>

<Text>Always a vibe pulling up at SBC. I’m partial to that top shelf and the stains are always potent. Bone was my budtender today... he & I kept the energy in the room. He knew exactly what fire I was looking for,  the music was lit, his personality was dope, my stamp card was maxed out so I’ll definitely be back, overall SBC displays excellent customer service. The homegirl bud tenders often show love too. Always compliments on my bags & outfits. I look forward to dropping off my mixtape and having y’all light up to one of my songs....

<review>So I typically come here for my flower because it’s close to home. I’ve been going for some time now but to be honest the buds have always been mid grade at best. So they claim to have exotic and top shelf. Yesterday I went a got a 8th of runts, came home broke it down and three seeds came out of the bud. We all know what this means! The weed was garbage. That plant was pollinated by a male or it hermed either way I’m very disappointed. $45 for an 8th of exotic with seeds in it?? Naw I can get a 8th for $25 in LA. I’m probably not gonna be going there anymore. The staff is great but the product is sub par at best. Maybe I’ll go and confront the shop about it and see what they say.</review>< Time>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Horrible. Must be the new employees.
I've been going here for years and with what happened today it's hard to say I'd come back.
Went it, receptionist was nice and professional.
Waited my turn then a bud tender assisted me and was so certain that the flower I was getting was indica.Came home smoke a few bowl and a joint,
Few minutes later I have a bad head ache, tried to slee it off but barely slept. Did my research and found out the strain of flower I got that I thought was indica is actually stativa. I 5Gs of static's I did not want in the first place. Ruined my whole experience with this place.

Sucks to say no one from this shop will ever hit me up to find a fix for a long term customer.< /Review>< pictures>

They lied about there special promotion today. No goody bags no snacks. Bogo on vapes. Gimme a break. Plus the girl today has no personality to be in this business. Weeds good. Didn't have indica either<//review>

I couldn’t believe the service I received when i as soon as i walked right in. The staff is so knowledgeable and so beyond friendly. Because this was my first time here they loaded me up with care packages and complementary gifts and made sure i left with a smile on my face. I highly recommend this place.<//text>< pics>
