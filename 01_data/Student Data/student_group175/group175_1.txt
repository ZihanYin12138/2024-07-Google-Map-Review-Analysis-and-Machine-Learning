<Text>We signed them up for home inspection in 4S ranch. The inspector was testing water (i guess) and left taps open on the 2nd floor with the stopper pulled up. It cause flooding in the whole master bath and water came down all the way to the living room/kitchen.

I am hoping the inspector faced consequences (dont want to name and shame here). Their general manager initially assured they would do anything to make this right. (they even got a damage repair quote of 30K from a water damage remediation firm). But soon, the reality set in, they redirected all queries to their insurance company which was pretty non-responsive. Ultimately low-balling an willing to pay only ~8K.

The bottom line is that accidents happen...But try to choose a company that has good insurance coverage from a reputable insurance company. Most inspectors generally do a good job, but you should choose a firm backed by good liability coverage.</Text>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Had a pre purchase inspection with this company.   Probably not the cheapest company you can find, but I tried that once and, though it worked out, it was not a good inspection.
Our inspector was friendly but stayed on task.  He was working steadfastly and still took over 3 hours to inspect the home.   He was moving quickly but was very thorough.   The report came back the next day (a weekend) and was nicely put together.   Easy to access and download.
Based on this inspection we decided the home would be a money pit.  I gave it a pretty good once over during a tour and thought it looked good.

With the unbelievably poor construction in California, you MUST have a good inspection.
Will use again.  If I can get back my faith in Californians   enough to re-enter the housing market.<//text>< pics>

Notified when to meet the person doing my home inspection on a condo I was buying during the pandemic, with safety instructions. Upon arrival, the inspector, Natasha, saw me from the living room window and met me at the front door. We were both masked.

She was very pleasant, confident and very knowledgeable about home inspection as well as her tools of the trade, advanced technology exposing things that are easily missed by the untrained person, which she used very effectively.

Natasha walked me through the entire condominium unit covering every aspect imaginable. By the time we were done it felt like I knew everything that I need to know about the property, leaving me at ease and confidence that I could efficiently and easily deal with any the issues ahead and felt assured of my new purchase.

It was a very informative and pleasant experience. Her report was made available that afternoon and was very clear, accompanied with photos pointing to her findings, and full of detail information and also listed resources for future reference.

Robinson’s Inspection Group deserves a lot of credit for having employees of her caliber. It is without hesitation that I write this review and feel very good about highly recommend Robinson’s Inspection Group for home inspection.< /text>

I had pre-purchase home inspection. Very professional yet personable.  Scheduling online was super easy.  I got a couple reminder emails...  just enough to be very helpful and well timed!  Inspection itself was thorough, as was the verbal overview.  Report is very thorough and easy to read, and provides a lot of value.  Thanks!</Review>

I used this company twice and specifically requested Natasha for my 2nd inspection after she SAVED me from buying a house (was in Escrow) which had countless issues/concerns.  I would HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone!  The report; timely responses, updates, and feedback; plus overall experience were amazing.  I couldn't have had a better experience and this is coming from someone who had to pay for their services twice.< /review>

<pics>None</pics><Text>I have had several inspections on houses in the past but this was by fair the best experience.  The inspector walked me through the report on a conference call about an hour after the inspection was completed.  This was extremely helpful as this enabled me to lock my mortgage rate on the same day as the inspection before seeing the official report.

His explanation of the report was relaxed and not rushed and was willing to answer many questions.

Scheduling and payment was also very straight forward.

I would recommend this company and especially my inspector Matt to anyone.</Text></record>

Curtis did an amazing job! He was super thorough and made sure everything about our house was safe and ready for us to purchase! The report they send you afterwards has pictures of every single thing with arrows pointing at the exact issue and a caption telling you what you are looking at. It was so helpful! They did a fantastic job and I highly recommend them!< /Review>

We are moving from LA to San Diego.
The paperwork that was required before the inspection was done easily.
The instructions on what time we should be there during the inspection were clear,  just in case we wanted to be there that day.
We got there and we felt very welcome. This was important because we felt home before escrow closes.
Curtis was amazing.
He was friendly, professional, very knowledgeable and ready to answer our questions clearly.
It’s not the cheapest company out there but it’s worth every penny as they were so detailed on their inspection.
Highly recommended!
Luis Medina.< /review>

We were fortunate enough to have the owner John Robinson inspect our home. As first time buyers, we were very concerned with ever detail of our potential home. John and his assistant made it a point to explain their process up front, and put us at ease. They were incredibly thorough, and took their time (3+ hours) inspecting the property. They took photos, videos, and promptly sent us a extensive report. It was a pleasure working with John and we highly recommend them!< /text>

More than satisfied with John Robinson's Inspection Group‘s Representative, Curtis Kelley. Performed a thorough inspection of our home and relayed all of his concerns in a manner where we were left with absolutely no questions. Curtis did an excellent job with our home inspection.  The inspection  report that he provides is outstanding. The information/quote was given with pictures as well as color coded in a way we were able to prioritize repairs easily. He definitely had more than met our expectations. I would recommend Curtis without hesitation!</Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Be prepared for a very lengthy, comprehensive electronic report. My goodness - I don't think Chris, our inspector, missed anything while there. He was very knowledgeable, informative, and more than willing to answer any questions - during the inspection and after.  Including big ticket items, he even picked up on the tiniest details we never would have thought of looking for.  His explanations of what he was going to look for made perfect sense. His report noted a few 'serious problems' with the house we were purchasing, which we were able to pass on to the sellers.  I would not hesitate to use this company again. Chris is a top notch inspector for John Robinson's Inspection.  Thank you for your detailed service and commitment to your customers.</text></record></dataset><record>

For our home inspection we had Wyatt.

This Wyatt was better than Wyatt Earp. He spent hours on our potential home and went through every nook and cranny. Most importantly he was personable and educated us on the flaws of the home and gave us a run down. It was almost like a 101 class. It was getting dark and he didn't leave until he felt he gave 100%. The inspection report came back from the company and was comprehensive, easy to read, etc. I will be recommending this company to others. Props to Wyatt!<//Review>

We hired John Robinson's Inspection Group as home buyers and we were on a tight escrow schedule.  They were able to get out promptly and the inspector, Chris, did a thorough and professional job of not only inspecting the house but explaining everything and answering questions.  The final report was detailed and full of pictures and captions.  I would highly recommend John Robinson's and cannot say enough good things about this company.<//Text>

He fully covered the items required of the inspection, and took time to engage with me (buyer) and the realtors when anything was worth taking a look at in person.  He went over what he found and took time to address questions and concerns that I had before he left.  I knew he had done a good job simply by watching him perform his tasks in the fluid and organized manner demonstrating his solid level of experience in his field.  The prepared report was finished and delivered by the next day, it covered all items of concern in an very organized, easy to digest and detailed manner.  Super easy to process the few  issues the house had, and each item had photos and descriptions.  The format they used was the most user friendly of the 12 or so inspections we’ve had done on houses In the past as well.  John Robinson (the owner)  was in the area during our inspection, and he dropped by to see how everything was going; a nice personal touch from a caring and involved owner.    Jade in the office went out of her way to accommodate a tight schedule and a couple schedule changes...and she did it with style and grace....she was really helpful and informative.    All in all, this was the best experience one could hope for from a home inspection.....I would 100% recommend them to anyone;  they were Simply the best I’ve experienced.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Our inspector, Natasha, showed up on time and explained the process to us. She offered to let us tag along if we wanted (we declined). After she was done, we were amazed at how detail-oriented she was in the process. She left nothing out. She was amazing. And she had our report to us within hours! And the report was at least as detailed as she had been in person. She was the best. I highly recommend John Robinson's Inspection Group, well worth the money!</Text>< pics>

Wow, Chris did a great job, talked with me in the beginning about what I was concerned about to make sure to specially address it. It took about 4 hours, which was great, not rushed, super thorough! The report is easy to read and Chris did a great job capturing pictures and explaining everything to me before he left. Really nice working with them.</text>

I cannot recommend John Robinson’s inspection enough. Natasha is fun, down to earth, and extremely thorough and professional. She made me feel welcome to partake in the inspection and ask questions as we walked through the property. I will definitely be using these services again if I ever move.</review>

<review>We are thoroughly please with the work that John Robinson's Inspection Group for us in the home buying process. The report was super thorough and well laid out. The inspector was very friendly and gave us a verbal walk-through of his inspections after it was all done. It helped to understand the written report better and not make all the findings seem so daunting. The level of inspection and the scope of areas inspected were truly helpful when making the final determination on the home. Would use again in a heartbeat!</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
John Robinson's Inspection Group made our home buying experience go really smooth. As first time home buyers we didn't know what to expect but we are glad we found John . It was easy to make an appointment through their online portal. His team is very responsive to questions via email and phone. We thought we were getting a different inspector but were lucky to have John Robinson himself on the day of the inspection! He was very friendly, thorough, knowledgable and respectful of the house, our curiosity and everyone's time.  Our inspection report was done in a timely manner (hours) and was well organized and documented. Would definitely recommend!< /Review>

You always end up with a top notch report to make an informed decision as to what needs immediate attention, further evaluation and what you need to be aware of for future repair. Colored pictures are also provided to god your memory because lets face it, you have enough going on at this point in the game.

<Text>I love John Robinson’s Inspection group! I’ve had Andrew, Curtis and Dallas as inspectors before and all of them come with extensive knowledge to educate the buyer with exactly what kind of home they are getting into, and where to investigate further if need be. They are incredibly helpful even after the inspection. Thank you guys for your thorough reports that are easy to understand.

We used John Robinson Inspection for a condo we are in the process of purchasing. They were very accomadating so we could meet our timeline in the contracts. In addition we live in another state so we could not be there and John took a good amount of time to go over everything with us by phone. The report was so well done and they made the entire process as easy as possible. We would definitely recommend this company for any home inspection.<//text>

It was super cool that when he noticed things he would explain it to me at the house, tell me it's going to be in the report, then the report was consistent with what he had told me. He described how he was using thermo heat camera and explained what that meant, what it indicates for him. He really was awesome.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Chris from the John Robinson's Inspection Group went throughly over the house under inspection with detailed report of every little things you can imagine. He also took his time to verbally explain his observations and answered all our questions and concerns.

<Review>I was lucky enough to have Andrew Powell inspect my home.  He was very patient with me because I tend to ask a lot of questions.  I’ve taken on a few fixer projects in the past and I wanted a good inspector who was knowledgeable and was also willing to talk things over with me while they were conducting the inspection.  While some inspectors tend to complete inspections in isolation out of fear of being bludgeoned with questions, Andrew welcomed the questions and took the time to fully understand the concerns and explain potential causes and root issues of findings while conducting his review.  At first he began to speak in layman’s terms without a lot of jargon to make his explanation easy to understand and when I began to peel the onion to get deeper insight he was able to really get in the weeds with multiple issues from plumbing to electrical to Ac issues.  So whether you are a first time home buyer or a seasoned flipper he will cater to your needs to conduct a thoughtful inspection where you can buy with greater confidence.<//Review><user_id>108240171662506209828<//user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response></record>

Home inspection was very thorough. Both My husband and I were very impressed with Andrew's professionalism and attention to detail. (The seller's even asked if their services were available in other states).<//Review>

We have had 4 inspections completed in the last 4 years all with John Robinson’s Inspection Group and have been very pleased with how thorough every report is and how pleasant and knowledgeable the inspectors are. We can always call with questions on the report and feel more secure with our home purchases due to their inspections.< /Text>

I was fortunate to work with Chad Stewart of John Robinson’s Inspection Group.  Chad was very thorough in the inspection he carried.  He was patient and clear in answering any questions I had about any property feature.  At the conclusion of the visit, he provided a verbal summary of his findings and also presented via his laptop digital photos he had taken.  His pdf report was ready for review in less than 24 hours.  If I need another property inspection in the future, I definitely see contacting John Robinson’s Inspection Group again and, in particular, working with Chad Stewart if he is available!< /text>

Matt from John Robinson did our inspection.  He was thorough and very professional.  We walked the property during the summary and he patiently answered every one of our questions.  I definitely recommend having this group perform your home inspection.< /Review>

I was referred to John Robinson's by my agent and also a friend who had used them in the past. After my inspection, I can see why! It's amazing the detail they put into the report and inspection. Mike was our inspector and I was very pleased with how he explained everything he found to me. In a seemingly perfect condo, he found like 50 things to put in the report. Also, if you contact and set up your appointment through yelp, you'll get a $30 discount :)

Very glad I chose John Robinson's Inspection Group as my inspectors. I definitely personally recommend Mike for your inspections!</Text>

This includes a variety of trades, from house cleaning services, to mortgage lenders, to title companies, and home inspection companies. I've worked with John Robinson's Inspection Group with my last two clients and have been thrilled with the customer service, the detailed inspection report, the communication that they provide to my clients and myself, and their knowledge/experience. I feel 100% confident referring this company to my clients and know and trust they are the right fit to best serve them. It's a huge weight off of my shoulders to know my clients are in good hands during such an important time in their live such as buying a home.

<text>Our inspector was Jeff Talcott and he was extremely thorough, professional and explained everything step by step.  He took about 150+ pictures of the home. He also did the thermal imaging, which I would definitely include in your inspection. He answered all our questions and told us if we had any other concerns or questions later on, to please not hesitate to contact him. Randa was the one who did the transaction and she was very professional and clear explaining what the inspection entailed. Thank you so much!!! I recommend John Robinson’s to anyone who is considering getting an inspection of their home or business.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dc001f6d597eff:0x22fabb7c5faf9c3d</GmapID></record>

Our inspector, Andrew, was not only on time, but early to our appointment.  He was extremely friendly, courteous, professional, and efficient.  He explained the process to us completely before starting and encouraged us to walk around the property with him as he inspected so he could point things out and explain what he was doing and why.  And the end of the inspection he immediately gave us a brief overview of his findings and promised a full report by the following morning.  The report was in our inbox a few hours later.  I had a great experience with John Robinson's Inspection Group from setting up the appointment to receiving the inspection report.  I intent to use their services again and I would highly recommend this company.</text>

<Text>I have purchased and sold more than a dozen homes in my life and until I met John, I didn't realize how valuable a thorough home inspector could be.  In spite of my experience, John's company identified things that I never would have seen or understood.  He saved me thousands of dollars in repairs that I would have otherwise been necessary.  His report was thorough with photographs and explanations describing the necessity of his recommendations.
If you don't hire John's company, you'll be sorry.<//Text><resp>None< /resp>< name>

This is my second time using John Robinson Inspection Group and I honestly cannot say enough great things about this company and John himself! All of the incredible 5 star reviews that you see online are there because they are just that....INCREDIBLE! They not only know their stuff, but they are courteous, quick, and AFFORDABLE! I not only use JRIG for my personal purchases, but being that I'm in the real estate business, I refer all of my clients to them as well! I promise, they will not disappoint!  :)<//Text>

Thanks to Chad and JR, I was able to prioritize those items most in need of attention immediately after closing.  I highly recommend them and grateful that I was referred to them in turn!< /text>

John Robinson company is the BEST home inspection period!!!  After searching through all the Yelps and Google reviews we gave them a  call because we need a Home inspection fast.  I called on a Monday and had an inspector there on Wednesday.  Mike was the inspector sent to us and this guy is all business and very, very professional.  When Mike spoke with me in the morning he outlined all he was going to do and then said we will review his inspection in laymen's terms.  I did appreciate that Very MUCH!!  I cant say enough about Mike or John Robinson they are the Best around!!  My experience was with Mike and I know that everyone else there is the same highly professional.  So do yourself a favor call them,  you will not be dissatisfied!!<//Review>

John Robinson and his entire staff are great honest people who do thorough quality inspections at a reasonable price. They make sure to go over their inspections with their clients. They are trustworthy and I would recommend them to any real estate agent or buyer looking for a home inspection company. Thank you for all the good work you have provided for us!</Review>

<userid>107972158531113968538</userid><review>We recently hired JRIG to perform a pre-purchase house inspection.  In short, the service exceeded our expectations (which were already high, based in online reviews).  The inspector was prompt, thorough and courteous.  He discovered and advised us on many issues with the home that we had previously not been aware of.  We are extremely grateful and would recommend the company (and, specifically, their inspector Dallas Compton) without hesitation.</review>< Pics>

Our inspector was Curtis Kelley - polite, professional, and very thorough in his work. He is so knowledgeable; it can be overwhelming to be a first time home buyer, but he put us at ease. He went above and beyond in explaining everything in such detail that we could understand, patiently answered all our endless questions, took time to walk us around and show us everything. He also lets you know if something is a major concern or a minor issue. The inspection was complete in a couple of hours and we had the full detailed report with pictures ready the same evening. Really appreciate his expertise and professionalism.
We would definitely recommend him!< /text>

John and his team have completed multiple inspections for my clients.  They are always early, explain their findings in detail and provide clear and concise reports.  If you are tech or gadget person, they have some of the coolest devices they use on their home inspections.<//Review>

They can scare a buyer from even considering the purchase of a house that is actually in good condition. The inspector from John Robinson's was professional and prompt. He explained everything to me and did not hesitate to point out current and potential problems with the house I am buying. However, he did so in a way that I was fully aware of the problems without being overly afraid. I would recommend this company to both buyers and sellers.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>John performed the inspection of my condo in Eastlake Chula Vista that I submitted an offer on.  He was very professional and I believe that his inspection was as thorough as it could possibly be.  Not only did he explain what he found, but with photos and detailed descriptions and solutions, I don't believe that I could ask for any other person.  His equipment is state of the art and so is his experience.  I would definitely refer this group to all my friends, family, and strangers too!<//Review><Time>1364222051354</Time><resp>None< /resp>< user_id>

I had a home inspection performed on my property on Saturday August 11th at 9AM- I left for a vacation over the weekend.  When arrived home on Sunday August 12th in the evening from a vacation around 6:45 pm, my fridge was filled with spoiled food and a freezer with melted ice cream dripped all over the inside.  I also had several medications and prescription strength probiotics for my son that are very expensive (flown in from Canada) that are all bad now.

I immediately notified the company and asked them for their insurance information. I attached pictures of how we found the breaker (which also appears to be off in the photos from the inspector) and the food. I asked for the information for insurance to file a claim to pay for the damages. I received a call from the owner (John Robinson) who told me "You are a Liar trying to get money out of me" and said that my neighbor had come inside of the house and turned by breaker off?!! outrageous! He refused to provide his insurance information and I am planning to cancel this real estate transaction due to this incident.

Thank you,

-Marie Graves<//Text>

<Review>We had the privilege of having Chad perform our home inspection for our first-ever home purchase and couldn't have been happier with the level of service. Not only did he come out next-day for an inspection request (we were in a very short escrow) but he took advantage of the fact that it was pouring down rain outside to perform a thorough inspection in the attic for any possible leaks. As an prior contractor, Chad's knowledge was above and beyond what most home inspectors possess. He was able to give us some extra information on possible reconstruction ideas since my fiance and I plan on renovating the house. Compared to the home inspection that the prior buyers had done (which fell out of escrow), John Robinson's report was far more detailed and comprehensive. To top it all off, they gave us a small discount for contributing a few coats to their clothing drive for the homeless. The inspection was very reasonably priced to begin with, but it's nice to know that they give back to the community too. I wouldn't hesitate to use their services again for our next purchase.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>I was very very satisfied with my recent home inspection. After the inspection was over everything was explained to me in full detail with nothing to little left out. He even went as far as showing me where shut off valves where incase i ever needed to use them. I really feel like i know what im buying now and i do not have to streas because i now know everything about the house. I highly encourage everyone to use this bussiness.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< response>

I bought a brand new home and figured I didn't need a home inspection. I'm really glad I decided to do it anyways and have John and his team come out to inspect our home. He found 2 gas leaks, 2 water leaks, low water pressure, a broken ac unit (YES on a brand new home!) and some other minor things that needed fixing that my very detailed oriented eye didn't see. I mean I can spot a scratch on a car from a mile away, but he knew exactly where to check for faults that I would he never checked, like where the sink is sealed to the counter top, etc... It was really worth knowing what I was getting in the home I was about to sign my life away to. He used very hi-tech cameras to check walls and pipes, and a quad copter drone to take video of all the roof tiles to verify they weren't broken, and much more awesome equipment. If I buy another home or if any of my friends ever buy a house, I will no doubtably recommend John. I'm extremely impressed and he delivered in a very timely manner a report that was not only easy to read and understand, but full of pictures and full explanations of all the issues. A+ work, A+ service, A+ all around. Thank you!< /text>

< review>
So each time I have been in Chico over the last few years I have been frustrated with barbers.  So this time I went for a salon, Natalie was the lovely lady that had time in her schedule to fit me in.  When I walked in the aroma was very pleasant unlike so many salons, it felt roomy yet warm and comfortable.   Nicely broken up to allow for privacy and function at each station.  Natalie was an extremely interesting and proficient stylist who can carry on a conversation and make you feel welcome.  After a nice smooth, gentle, cut off too the very comfortable wash basin.  For what if it had lasted 5 more minutes would have put me to sleep, rinse and wash.  When it was all done I couldn't believe she was only charging what a normal barber would charge.  So many salons are double the price of a barber for a simple buzz cut.  So I was more than happy to pay what was asked and more.  When I am in Chico I will without doubt return the Two22 salon and to Natalie.  I did only rate 4 stars because they were unable to help me with my facial waxing needs.</review>

Cammy did a color correction on my hair to fix a balayage gone wrong and she did an amazing job. She is very informative & friendly! I  had to try several salons before finding Two22 salon / Cammy but i feel so relieved now that I know my hair will be taken care of properly!!! Definitely recommend:)<//Review>

For the Love of Dog Training<//name>
<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>I've known Sunshine since 2016. I was excited that she had taken the leap into business ownership. She has referred a few people to me for dog training, and my other biz over the years, but recently my schedule got a little nuts and I had to really make adjustments to later in the evenings to make sure I could cover my self employment obligations (I alos own a brick & Mortar as well) Although I loved my other stylist I knew it would be hard for her to work that late. Covid has certainly changed things for so many of us. Today was my second appointment I was able to push out to 8 wks vs 5 (when I usually start seeing those glitter strands) so that saves me some money and time in the chair. We have amazing conversation as well, that's important afterall I am with her for a bit and I have her undivided attention during my time with her, she doesn't seem to over book herself and I don't think I saw her touch her phone once although I was working on mine while chatting. I am sure if I didn't want to talk that would be ok too but let's get to the work: I showed her a "hair goals" picture from good 'ole pinterest. We developed a course of action and discussed the health of my hair. She has a variety of retail, but she recommended one particular product that made a noticable difference. Her attention to detail is remarkable. My hair is "dark" a huge thing for me is paying lots of money but having dye ALL over my ears, neck, and forehead. I wanna be able to walk out with my fresh 'do and go straight to dinner, it might be chicken nuggets in front of Teen Mom 2, but hey, I am a girl who likes to have the option. She takes her time and you can tell she loves her craft. The salon atmosphere has an upscale feel but not snooty. I feel totally fine wearing sweats or a ball gown. Downtown chico parking had me worried but she is conviently located right across the street from the parking garage, with easy access back out onto main roads and to the highway. The protcols she has taken for covid are also something to mention. She maintains the work enviornment of the salon with an eye for detail; the floors, window ledges, mirrors, products are dust free, you can see pride in her ownership. At my first appointment she texted me reminding me of my mask, and upon entry took my temp. My mask was a light color so she offered me a disposable to not stain my mask. Before even getting started she sets the mood by offering a beverage; wine, truly, water, whatever you are hoping for. If you're looking for a place to go highly recommend checking them out or if you're a stylist looking for a place to go that has this vibe I would check it out!< /Review><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808327ba77ca1003:0xc871fc7815772956< /gmapID>< user_id>

The salon is full of stylist that are friendly, artistic and well educated on all the top hair trends. The vibe of this place is relaxed with a good energy.

Very comfy place but... the lady that cut my hair did a bad job at cutting my hair. I have thin hair and She some parts of my hair shorter than the other. She finished the cut in about 5 minutes, which was super quick, but didn’t take the time to fix my hair or made sure that I liked it. Seemed to me like she was in a rush. Not to mention, she charged me 50 bucks!< /text>

Nice people but mega long finger nails were clawing into my skull... no thanks!!!

Used chemicals and leave-in product after I said a few times that I’m allergic! My skin was on fire.

If you don’t have ANY products that are hypoallergenic, please don’t use anything!!

No one picks up the phone. Nightmare having to reschedule while I’m at work!! Please be more considerate.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>My experience with Dani has always been a five star rating. What I really like about the service she provides is how much time she spends with me as her client to brain storm and share some perspective from years of gaining knowledge in hair. She also has really great taste, so inevitably I always end up walking out loving my hair. Upon styling my hair she also takes the time to show me how to style it on my own so our ultimate goal is to not have great hair one day but every day! Thank you so much Dani! I highly recommend you!<//Text>< pictures>

I have very thick hair that has not been cut well by people in the past, but she knew exactly what to do and made me feel GORGEOUS when I left. I wish I could have her back in Seattle, because she really was that amazing.

I cannot recommend her enough if you want a quality cut at an affordable price, she’s the lady. I’m sure the other stylists are great, but Veronica is a literal unicorn with magic powers.

Thank you so much Veronica!!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I came to stephanie asking her to add blonde to my roots to blend to my existing blonde and then add a little brown with lowlights.  I sat with her for 4 hours and she charged me $170 dollars for doing nothing but slightly darkening it. When I asked her to fix it she said she would but wouldn't put any blonde in it.  She wasted my time, took my money and now I have to pay for someone else to fix it. Dave yourself the hassle and avoid her!< /Review><date>1563419261690</date>< userid>

I came in needing a huge change in my damaged, patchy colored hair and Haylee made me beautiful again!! She’s so sweet, listens to exactly what you want and gives you results while protecting the integrity of your hair. I absolutely love my new look and will be coming to see Haylee again. Definitely recommend seeing her if you’re in need of a new look! ❤️<//Text>

<text>I highly recommend this office! Dr. Bienstock and his staff are very professional, caring and friendly! He took care of all my extractions and bone grafts- he’s an expert at what he does! Also in the past,  he took care of extractions and implants I needed and I’ve never been more pleased! Best oral surgery office in Santa Barbara!</text>< pics>

I have had two extractions and two implants placed over the last year. I highly recommend this great team of doctors and staff.  Dr Samantha Jones was caring, delightful and professional in all respects. I am almost sorry I do not need any more dental work done at this time!< /Review>

Dr Bienstock & Staff were the best! I was terrified to get all 4 wisdom teeth out as I have never had any type of surgery before, but they made me feel very relaxed and I cannot thank them enough for their professionalism and kindness. I will refer all of my friends and family to Dr Bienstock in the future.

Being young and not knowing much about insurance, they were able to clearly explain to me what the process would look like and what to expect. There were no surprises post surgery.

Dr. Bienstock is a very talented man. I had NO swelling post surgery and barely any pain! I actually felt much better on day 2-5 than I did the weeks before surgery for reference. I am still in the healing process as today is day 6 and I can say the most inconvenient part of the whole surgery is having to eat like a baby giraffe until the holes are completely filled back in. Haha. I am so thankful for the SB Center for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. THANK YOU AGAIN, YOU GUYS ROCK!<//Text>

My experience with Dr. Hall was outstanding.. From my pre-op appointment to my wisdom teeth(two) surgery, I always felt  comfortable with their entire staff and with explanation of what the procedure would entail. The icing on the cake was that I had two wisdom teeth taken out in the same day and I went home with little to no swelling and very little pain. Professional office with 5 star care!<//review>

<user_name>Mari Eisenbeisz</user_name><Text>After terrible experiences with other dentists and struggles with insurance, I was desperate to find a well qualified office that could remove my wisdom teeth. Dr. Hall and his team are amazing and I had such a wonderful experience from beginning to end. The front desk is very welcoming and the staff are very knowledgeable. They provided me with everything I needed to know and gave me an honest quote without trouble. I was given an appointment the same week as my consultation, which was amazing since I was so eager to get my teeth removed. The surgery the day of was easy and flawless and they really did everything they could to help the healing process go smoothly. Dr. Hall made sure to schedule a check up apt a week after the surgery and gave me a list of recommended general dentists since I didn't have one at the time, which I really appreciated. Wonderful office!</Text>< Pics>

Dr. Beinstock was so sweet with my 7 year old daughter.  He also made me feel very assured.  She was having 5 teeth extracted and they made her feel super comfortable.  She is 24hr out from her procedure and doing great today and in not too much pain.  All the staff in the office are very nice too.<//Text>

<Text>I appreciate Dr. Hall's thoroughness and conscientiousness taking care of my implant.  I ran into a complication that required much more exacting work and he made the time to be sure the work was done right.  This extra time for me, I know, backed up his office and patients waiting.  I'm sorry to those that had to wait but just know Dr. Hall will give you the utmost care to be sure the work is done right.  Thank you Dr. Hall and all your office staff.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Time>

Seems strange to describe a visit to the oral surgeon as enjoyable. But this is the category that I'd put my latest visit in. I appreciated all of the care from the pleasant staff and the attention given me to explain all aspects of the procedure. Totally professional in all regards, while friendly and accommodating. Much focus on my total comfort. I feel I'm in great hands with Marc and the gang. Thank you!</Text>

I've been on a nigh-lifelong odyssey since a childhood car accident to restore my teeth, the last stage requiring bone grafts and implants. After years of surgeries and restoration work, it was imperative to find the right help for the final and most important aspects of my case.  Dr. Bienstock is an absolute rockstar at his work and he and his staff were a joy to work with throughout the entire process.  I am so relieved and elated to have found such excellent care for my complicated case and wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Bienstock for the best possible results one could hope for.</review>

Dr Hall bed side manners are phenomenal! What an amazing job he did! Pain ZERO! for getting my 4 wisdom teeth out at once WOW! I EXPECTED ALOT OF PAIN BLOOD but none of that Dr. Hall is by far one of the TOP doctors I would go to again refer and TRUST!

Thank you to every one in the office for putting up with a winnie like me!<//Text></record>

Overall a great place, with an incredibly friendly staff. Dr. was knowledgeable and very accommodating of my schedule and urgency. Extraction procedure was relatively quick and painless. A tooth of mine did get slightly chipped during the procedure, however, I suppose it was due to its location relative to the tooth that was extracted.<//review>

I was not a regular patient of this practice, but was seen on an emergency basis after a front tooth gave out. Dr. Bienstock and his team ably implanted a post in one sitting. He explained not only the surgery but how to ensure a successful graft during the three months before a permanent crown can be installed. The team ensured my comfort throughout the procedure. So far I'm extremely pleased.</Review>

<text>Drs Hall, Bienstock and Jones have taken care of both of my sons wisdom teeth. Most recently, I had let time slip by and realized that my 18 yr old needed to get in before college started and we only had a few weeks. The front office provided excellent customer service and helped us get in on a very tight schedule. Dr Jones did a great job on the surgery and Dr Hall got us in for a quick post surgical visit before my son went off to college.  We couldn’t have been happier. We highly recommend this practice!<//text><Name>daryl stegall< /Name>< UserId.>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Dr. Hall recently removed all 4 of my wisdom teeth.  The procedure went very smoothly!  The staff was very courteous and comforting.  It was nice that I was able to fill out all the paperwork online beforehand so I wasn't overwhelmed with paperwork in the waiting room.  I had general anesthesia so I didn't feel a thing and wasn't nervous.  The procedure took less than an hour.  I didn't have any pain for the rest of the day.

The recovery was surprisingly easy.  I followed Dr. Hall's instructions about rinsing, eating, etc. and had no problems.  My swelling was minimal and I never even needed prescription pain medicine (just some Advil).  I was able to comfortably eat whatever I wanted less than a week after the procedure.  I highly recommend Dr. Hall and the staff at SB Center for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery!</Review>< Pictures>

I’ve been to, David C. Hall, DDS, several times over the years and every time has been great service, well explained procedures and any questions are quickly answered.  The staff are always happy and willing to help you in any way.  Dr. Hall is a very caring and gentle dentist; and I’ve been to approximately 10 different dentists/specialists over the years, and Dr. Hall ranks high on my list.<//text>

<review>i Had 3 of wisdom teeth removed here! Went in for a consultation and was fit in for an extraction ASAP. Nurse Sandra was extremely nice and calmed my nerves the day of “my surgery”. Had no issue at all with the doctor or nurse.
Although, one of the front desk lady was extremely rude. I was a bit late, due to traffic on the freeway and when I got in, she gave a bit of attitude but I shrugged it off. Fast forward a couple hours later when I’m conscious, my sister tells me the same front desk lady was rude to her when she came in to pick me up.<//review>< pics>

From pulling my tooth to building a bone graft for replacement, this is the oral surgeon you want.  Dr. Bienstock and his staff are not merely proficient, they are exemplary in the attention to detail and skill they give to patients.  Everyone in this office gave clear explanations that answered my questions and helped me through the process.  I was amazed that I never felt any undue pain (I had some swelling 2-3 days after tooth extraction, but that was it).

I’m very grateful to Dr. Bienstock and his staff for making a scary situation very doable and pain-free.

Many thanks!</Review>

Highly recommend! Dr Jones was friendly and very competent.  I didn't want to worry about the hassle of my insurance charging me for a biopsy and they said "if they send you a bill, bring it to us and we'll take care of it" First time a doctor's office has said something like that!<//Text>

Everything went just great .I waited just few minutes before they took me back .Numed me up for an extraction. Never felt anything after Dr Hall got it numbed. Was in and out in about 1/2 an hour. Great service all away around .I definitely would recommend them to everyone.<//Text>

I had a fantastic experience from start to finish with Dr. Bienstock and his team.  From the consult to having the implant put in to the follow up, I was put at ease with their attention to detail, knowledge and overall professionalism.  I was worried about the implant process but it ended up being so easy, I was pleasantly surprised! I highly recommend this group.<//Text>

<Text>Here's list of things that REALLY helped me relax (regarding surgery) and not lose control of my other life obligations in terms of was how well the Doctor and the Staff worked with my schedule and life needs.  1) the original date for a consultation totally didn't work... the Staff person told me "no Promises" but she said she would work hard to make something happen sooner.  She got me in the next day, warning me I might have to do some waiting (ended up being 10 minutes of extra waiting).  2) I'm kind of a detailed guy (and anxious), and both the staff person AND the Doctor seemed unhurried and happy to make sure I had realistic expectations and all questions were answered well!  3) Both the office and I were over-prepared for pain and healing rates.  I can't believe how short a time I was actually in the chair;  how little pain I had afterwards (i'm pretty sure they cut into jaw bone); and how little swelling I had (almost none).  4)  From my perspective, I think the office is amazingly efficient, seems to have great morale (I joked with them and they were obviously having fun with each other); and both Staff and Doctor were happy to take into account other things going on in my life which they  flexed around... Wow!  This level of service wasn't actually expected...</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Hall has removed the wisdom teeth of both of my children. His staff is professional and caring, and he himself is a master at what he does.  No pain, very little bleeding, ultra quick recovery time.  I love this office!</text>

<review>Yesterday in the OMS Goleta office I received an implant for my lower 2nd molar (the original problem tooth was extracted last November).  My experience of their new computer/doctor driven equipment along with Dr. Samantha Jones' skill was incredibly pain-free.  The procedure was also  much shorter than I had imagined.  I was treated very well, with respect.  My questions were answered, excellent post-op instructions were provided, and that same afternoon I received a personal followup call asking me how I was doing.  Surgical Dentistry doesn't get better than this!</review><user>102008142308530486485<//user><Resp>None</Resp>< time>

They did their job and took my wisdom teeth out. Only down side was that I was emailed my estimated bill rather that informing me verbally or over my phone. Since I don’t check my email often, I didn’t find out my bill until minutes before my teeth were taken out. Never discussed payment details before. Certainly not the most desirable situation.<//Review>

All the staff was super friendly from my consultation to surgery. The assistant who prepped me for my wisdom tooth extraction really helped calm my nerves down. Dr. Bienstock was so quick with the procedure, I felt like it all happened it 5 minutes! Both the Pedregosa and Patterson facilities are extremely well kept and comfortable. My recovery has been pleasant so far, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Overall I am so happy to have been referred to Dr. Bienstock by friends and my dentist, he has my recommendation!</text>

They were very kind and accommodating to help me feel at ease. The procedure went flawlessly and I cannot speak highly enough about all the people who work in this office.

<Review>Dr. Bienstock provides outstanding care.  The technology that he uses in his office is cutting edge.  I was confident that I was getting the best treatment possible today.  Dr. Bienstock has a modern office and his staff is professional and compassionate in the care that they provide.</Review>< Pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>At age 86, I needed the extraction of infected old implants, the reconstruction of lost bone, and the installation of three new implants. I felt  practically no pain and experienced  a minimum of swelling as Dr. Bienstock took care successfully of all this. The kind disposition of the nurses, Elle and Kim, made it easier to go through the fairly long procedure.</Review>< pics>

My experience with Dr. Bienstock and his team could not have been better.  This was my first implant so was not sure what to expect.  The entire process was incredibly smooth and efficient and much easier than anticipated.   I would highly recommend Dr. Bienstock and his team for anyone needing an implant procedure.<//Text>

< review>
Dr. Marc Bienstock, DDS, MD office staff provided excellent customer service and kindness.  I accidentally thought my daughter's appointment was at 7:15 am (it was at 7:50 am).  So we arrived and found the door locked.  I knocked and the nice desk manager opened the door.  After I explained my mistake, she said we were welcome to wait inside.  It was cold day in Goleta, so we appreciated that small act of kindness.

After the surgery, a medical assistant (Ms. Arzata)  discussed with us the post-surgery care routines.  My daughter asked for another blanket Ms. Arzata not only got one but help put it on my daughter.  Over the course of her answering my many questions, she readjusted the blanket on my daughter as it shifted off of her due to her movement.  That is another example of kindness and attention to the patient's comfort and needs.

They made this surgery experience better for my daughter and me.  They have a great staff there.

Dr. Bienstock answered all my questions during our initial visit several months ago.  My daughter is experiencing very little post surgery pain (she had four wisdom teeth removed).  We had to reschedule due to the holidays but it worked out great.  I couldn't be more pleased with our experience at SB Center for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.

Wishing you all the best!

Peace,  Michael Takahara< /review>

I am from out of state and travel for dental services because of the skills of my primary destist. When my dentist unexpectedly determined that I needed to have a tooth extraction and an implant hopefully completely during my out-of-state visit, he referred me to Dr. Marc Bienstock of Santa Barbara Center for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery as one of the best in the area. Dr Bienstock made room for me in his busy schedules and was able to extract the problem tooth and secure a implant within a couple of hours of the phone call. The healing went without a hitch and the success of the implant was confirmed within a few months time. It was without a doubt the most trouble-free complication that I have ever I countered. The office staff, the assistive care and particularly Dr. Bienstock were welcoming, thoughtful and provided excellent care. I would recommend them without reservation.< /Text>

<Review>I highly recommend the office of Drs. Hall, Bienstock and Jones. My daughter recently had her wisdom teeth removed and from the initial phone call to post op care, we've received the best service we could imagine. My daughter had pain prior to her appointment to have the teeth removed and the office was so accommodating in getting her in sooner to relieve her discomfort. After her surgery, she had no complications and received very thorough post op instructions which made her recovery that much easier. Both myself and my daughter appreciated the service and care that Drs. Hall, Bienstock, Jones and their staff gave us - they are definitely a 5 STAR OFFICE!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I had an incredibe experience with Dr. Bienstock and his staff.  I was extremely afaid to get my wisdom teeth removed and heard that it would be really painful afterwards.  On the contrary!!!!  Dr. Bienstock and his staff explained in detail what to expect from the surgery and how to take care of myself afterwards.  He was patient with me and my mom during the consultation and answered all of our questions.  Afterwards, I called into the office to refil my presciption and his staff quickly responded.  I wholeheartedly recommend him and his staff for any oral surgery needs!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I liked it because they give you all the attention and the doctor is always on the lookout for what you need and checking on his patient. Recommended

(Original)
Me gusto Porq le dan a uno toda la atención y el doctor siempre está al pendiente de lo que necesita y checando a su paciente. Recomendado</review>

We met with friends at this restaurant for lunch. my friend recommended this restaurant.  Well, it was very nice. The staff members welcomed us with a smile and we had an excellent feeling. The food was just great. We enjoyed every moment and we will definitely return to this restaurant. We recommend this place to all.<//Text>

good food.   Great service.    I thought my order didn't go through, but it did after all...   but I thought was ordering through postmates, instead it was sent as a uber eats order.   Host was great to solve the problem after trying to understand each other.   I almost left with nothing, till they found the order that matched mine and realized it was my order.   Thanks....</Review>

This is my favourite restaurant and has been for some time . Is the prices have become prohibitive to visiting often. But the food is amazing and the service is wonderful , but we just can't afford to go there as often as we used to .<//review>

Architecture is amazing.  One of the best buildings/restaurants I've seen anywhere on Earth.  Like going to eat in an art museum.  Had the lobster noodles and crispy snapper in "sand."   Food was good too.   Liked the miso seabass skewers.  Could pass on the tempura shrimp.<//Review>

<text>I love this place for lunch! The lunch specials are a great value and the food is outstanding. I have many Chinese options closer to me but I go the extra distance to dine here. If you like hot you must try some of there special chili oil that they prepare there and have on the table (or did before COVID), it's hot and very flavorful.< /text>< response>

<Text>Plates and pita sandwiches are all amazing here. Got the lamb pita with tzatziki sauce and it was so delicious. The zucchini chips were good but a little soggy. Prices are on the higher side for what you are paying for, but on par with classic Huntington Beach prices. Would definitely come here again. Happy to have an authentic Greek restaurant on New-bury street. FYI the place inside is small with limited seating.< /Text><Name>Esther Murphy</Name><GmapID>0x80dd26718f8c38e1:0xea784c9d000c89e0</GmapID><pics>None< /pics><user_id>108693633305112769363< /user_id>< Resp>

We've been coming here for a few years now and they always make you feel welcome like you're part of the family. All the Employees are really nice. Food is excellent here, love the pork fried rice and the beef chow mein. They have these cute animal paintings on the walls that my granddaughter loves. The restrooms are always nice and clean. Just a nice place to take the family.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>It had been years since we had been here, and tonight we decided we wanted Chinese food in our own community of HB. What a wonderful surprise to find such amazing food and great service. My husband had the house chow mein  and I had the Mongolian tofu--we shared egg fried rice. We arrived one hour before closing and when our food was served , it was fresh, hot, and DELICIOUS! Lastly, the Oolong tea was everything I needed to top off this magnificent meal. We will definitely be back soon with the kids.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Delivery time took too long to arrive and our food wasn't hot by the time they delivered it. They should hire more delivery people.  As for the food, it was not worth the dinner price. Maybe dine in experience is better. I ordered on Sunday at 430p and food didnt arrive until 6:19pm. The food was barely warm. VERY DISAPPOINTED!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great Chinese restaurant in HB. Can be pricey, but well worth it.
Great for a group of people.
Walnut shrimp is the best!</text>

This is my favorite Chinese Restaurant in the United States. It is not too fancy, but I like it. I feel like a part of the Family every time I walk in the front door. They have Hot and Sour Soup that is second to none. The menu is easy and yet varied. You simply choose a variety of ways to cook the food (Hot, Sweet and Sour, Mandarin, Orange, or about 10 different ways), and which protein you want cooked, (from Beef, to Chicken, Shrimp, and more), and it arrives just so wonderfully cooked. They have Specials, make sure to check out the Specials board, as well as seasonal wines and other goodies. I have only eaten at one which may be a little better, but Meinz, Germany is a long way from here.</review>

Ordered the combination fried rice and cream cheese fries wontons. It was pretty similar to what I was used to back home, which was a relief. I would definitely come to

The food is prepared well and consistent which is better than most restaurants. We love their kung pao chicken, Mongolian beef, garlic beef, honey walnut shrimp, and fried rice. Their butterfly shrimp is best eaten fresh instead of ordering as take out. They have brown rice as an option at no extra charge.</Review><time>1493436377387</time></record></dataset><record>

I ordered food to-go and a fairly large order, so I figured it would take a while as well as possibly be incorrect.  The person I spoke to over the phone was nice but there was a language barrier and when I tried to explain where I lived, he wasn't understanding.  Finally he got it down correctly and we were able to start my order.  I was told it would take an hour.  An hour went by and no food and no call.  About 1 hour and 20 minutes later I got a phone call from the delivery driver.  He had no idea where to go so I gave him step-by-step instructions, but he still wasn't able to figure it out.  So I walked out to the middle of the street, walked down the street, and waved him down.  He handed me my food and I said thank you and was about to leave when he said, where's my tip?  I said umm, no I'm sorry but I'm only paying for my food.  I'm not going to 1. give someone a tip who was 30 minutes late by the time I got my food, so it was cold, and 2. give someone a tip who's requesting one, like you're deserving of one.  What the heck.  To make matters worse ... the food was only mediocre.  It was cold and tasted blan.  No flavor to it.  I don't recommend this place.</Review>

< Review>
We finally tried this place for dinner about a month ago. WE LOVED IT! Got the Mongolian Trio, Broccoli Beef, & the Cream Cheese & Crab meat Wontons. This visit, we also,tried the Walnut Shrimp with a sweet cream cheese sauce. It was all delicious, but the Wontons & Walnut Shrimp are OMG wonderful.

We're here on our third visit & everything tasted wonderful again.

Service the first two visits was attentive & they didn't even get irritated when I spilled hot Egg Flower soup all over my husband & the table & the floor.....

This current visit, however, our waiter is rather unfriendly & seems like he would rather be anywhere else. No doubt this is a one off. (Fingers crossed!)

We will definitely be back more.</Review>

I always feel so guilty after consuming Chinese food, due to the copious amount of sodium and fats I've ingested.

Whenever I'm craving Chinese food in Huntington Beach, this is my go-to place for Chinese.

Reasonable lunch specials that also include soup and some sort of fried appetizer (cream cheese wonton or egg roll). My favorite is their fish fillet with hot garlic sauce. The fish is breaded and fried to a perfect texture, and the sauce is flavorful!

Considering the name of the restaurant is Kung Pao Bowl, I certainly had to try one of their kung pao bowls. Their kung pao shrimp is delicious! They mix in a lot of chili peppers along with scallions, celery, and peanuts to give the kung pao shrimp this intense zing.

I've also tried their Fried Rice, Chow Mein, and Curry Chicken. I've been satisfied with every dish thus far!

Good customer service as well.<//text>

More than 1 basketfull of rotten strawberries is not good for business, might  have been that they didn't have any fresh strawberries which is weird being surrounded by many strawberry fields,  but the strawberries that I bought were horrible 🤮 too many small & some had gone bad. try some of the places in Oxnard not this place in Santa Paula.</text>

<review>Very interesting and wonderful place. It’s a mixture of antique, souvenir and produce shop. I can here in second week of October and the pumpkin patch and Halloween park were already installed. It worth to stop and check it out with your family. Prices are affordable in general and staff are super nice. They have a big bird cage and coy pound as well. Definitely worth your time. Absolutely stopping here again.</review>< pics>

<Text>This is a great place for pumpkins and produce but it's even better thanks to new offerings: New Mexico style Carne Seca beef jerky, deep fried peanuts and individually wrapped fig newton style cookies in different fruit flavors! One of the best snack stops on this road!< /Text>< Pictures>

Excellent staff, knowledgeable and friendly. Gorgeous pond and fountain Lillie’s. Beautiful pottery. Local honey, nuts, fruit, jerky and lots of delicious treats. Near the fish hatchery and not too far from the beach. Great stop off spot before or after, great for old an young alike! ENJOY!<//Text>

Love this little gem.  I take the kids at least once a month and they feed the animals.
A tip: be gentle with the machine that have the animal food.   Don't break the machines ask for help if the knobs get stuck.<//Review>

<text>It was a memorable day, anytime with our grandchildren is wonderful. We expected just a little more. Santa met us right away at the beginning of our train ride. Which was exciting. Unfortunately we could have gotten off the train from that point.
The "village " was real disappointing. Kinda dirty, run down place. Not a lot of  Christmas there.  Also was hoping to get lunch at the village. Nothing there to eat. Could be so much more.< /text>< Pictures>

This place was, deserted / unstaffed and dilapidated when our FWRY Steam Train Engine #14 train ride made its customary stop there today (Labor Day weekend 2019). The general store was virtually empty and there was no clerk anyway. It was spooky and sad. It’s surprising that the buildings were even open. It was weird watching 150 fellow riders from our train ride stream in there and immediately turn around disappointed.< /text>

< review>
Road side tourist trap. Went here on the Christmas train from Fillmore. I'm guessing the arrangement is they don't charge the train ride folks so they get captive people for over an hour. I appreciate that there was an attempt to have some stuff for the kids, but the reality is it looks like that didn't do anything more than what they usually do on weekends which is minimal.  Some of the birds in aviaries are being plucked and look pretty tough, fun to explain to kids before seeing Santa.  Looks like a number of things for Christmas was simply Halloween stuff with fake snow on it.

TLDR if you like take snow on pallets and Walmart blow up Xmas decorations at a place that sells roadside trinkets than to here.< /review>

This place was great.  Through a friend, prior to going, I was able to speak with an employee, Andrea. Although it was her day off, she answered all of my questions and eased my anxiety. Everything Andrea told me was spot on and I was in and out in less than hour. Great staff and thorough examination. Thank you Andrea. Highly recommended!< /review>

<Review>It was easy to A rapid Covid test needed for traveling. Also they were able to identify that I needed a molecular test because that is the requirement of the airlines. I did not know that before the consulting of the doctor. I would recommend this place for easy and fast Covid testing requirements.< /Review><user_id>110226227826122979378</user_id><gmap_id>0x8094671793b17305:0x273f927e66deb334<//gmap_id><time>1618850857846<//time>< response>

I appreciate the extended hours. Front desk receptionist was professional- checked us in right away. MA can use some training in customer service and greeting skills, she wasn't friendly and we didn't feel welcomed. It made our visit uncomfortable. PA was polite, took his time, assess the need, with no recommendation for any treatment. We left there feeling like it was a waste of our time. We won't be coming back.<//Text>

I’ve been to this place to get Covid tested three times.  Every time the workers were professional and the process was timely.  I live in Clovis, but I drive all the way across town because I prefer this clinic is hassle free.<//text>

This was a life saver! We needed Hawaii a pre travel Covid test and we wanted same day results. Even if it was $199 it was worth every Penny. The staff was professional and very efficient. Stella was very friendly as well as the girl who called us.  We got our results in less than two hours. Highly recommend.<//review>

Wow! What an amazing staff. Everyone there is so pleasant and professional. Furthermore, what I really enjoyed in my dealing with them was that they were very understanding and they took the time to answer all of my questions and I didn't feel rushed to be put off the phone. Jay, their Operations Director knows how to pick a winning staff. Nicole, very pleasant when answering my questions and Stella was stellar to work with!!!<//text>

<text>My sis and I can't say enough about AFC Urgent Care and their staff - especially Jojo, Andrea and Bionce. We had to have a Covid test for a trip to Hawaii and they made it Sooo simple!

First of all, Jojo was incredibly gentle when swabbing us. Thank you Jojo!

Then when we picked up the results Andrea and Bionce were so patient and helpful. They helped us turn the results into PDFs and uploaded them. Thank you girls! We appreciate you!< /text>< pictures>

Unfortunately I still have the same nagging issue, but the Medical Assistant and the PA that assisted me were great. The PA took his time following up with me regarding the test that were preformed and I didn't feel rushed. I had an encounter with two medical professionals that seem to love what they are doing. The PA was able to rule out a lot of things which I am grateful for. Thank you again.<//text>

First time here. My daughter had a uti and I went to the clinic I usually go to which is suppose to take walk ins until 7:00pm. I arrived at 6:15pm and the staff told me “the Dr’s reached their patient quota so they left for the day” 😳😳😳  I then googled Urgent Care and found AFC. They helped me right away and took my insurance! The staff was super nice and the place was very clean and updated. My daughter was taken care of and they even gave us water and candy! Definitely the spot to go to next time for my entire family! Thank you.</text>

I saw that this location has the highest ratings so used the online appt system to reserve a time. It wasn't busy when we got there the next morning. We were able to check in quickly. They accept Medicare insurance.. Reception was pleasant, but mentioned an issue with the online appt system having problems. But we were allowed to sign in and use their iPad to enter our info.
The doctor and assistants were very nice and helped us feel comfortable. No rushing and they helped my mom. We were out in about an hour and have a follow-up appointment. Great experience.</Review>< username>

This is the nicest, quickest urgent care I've been to here in Fresno. The staff is all very nice. I've been here before, and they remembered my name. The care that I receive is individual, not rushed, and I felt like the doctor heard my concerns and addressed them. I highly recommend this urgent care for any non-emergency needs!</text>

Needed to get a Covid test for travel, and AFC came through!  Flight leaves on Tuesday, so we needed a negative Covid test on Sat or Sunday.  AFC was the only place in Fresno that met this criteria!  10+ experience.  My only recommendation would be for AFC to confirm the appointment a couple days in advance with an email.  As it stands now, once you book your appointment, you will not hear from them again until the day of.< /Text>

Had issues with their automated phone system after I scheduled my rapid test appointment. Went to they website, sent them a text and they got everything sorted out in less than 5 minutes. The testing sight was fast and efficient and the nurses were super nice. Got my results back within 3 hours. 4 stars due to the trouble of the website when registering and phone system.<//review>

<review>What an amazing experience. My wife and I had to get a Covid Test in order to travel to Hawaii and American Family Care (AFC) was suggested by an Hawaii Safe Travel Gent. We called and talked to Jay (Owner), he made the process seem so easy, he even took the time to stay on the line while we set our appoints up, Thank you Jay, what a pleasure to actually talk to a person versus a machine! We arrived the next day for our appointment and could not believe how organized and hassle free the testing process was. AFC advertised results back within four hours and they did not disappoint. Went and had lunch, three hours later they called with our results and told us we could pick up a hard copy of our results at any time. When we arrived, the staff was so personable and helpful, even took the time to show us how to scan and upload into our Hawaii Safe Travel account. Couldn’t of had a better overall experience and would highly recommend this facilities to everyone.<//review>< Pics>

I can't stand doctors however, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at AFC Urgent Care West Shaw. I went in with a problem in which they could not refer me out to anyone for due to the fact that they are not set up for that at least not as of yet. When I left though, the provider did have a solution for me and because of that and one other phone call to my insurance company the following day I have my appointment for the referral.
Thank you young lady, I hope you get a chance to read this.

<Text>My husband and I had to go through the rigorous steps of pre-covid testing for traveling to Hawaii. The entire process was ridiculously complicated, but the staff at AFC Urgent Care made the ordeal tolerable. They were professional, patient and they really tried to help us. The best part was when we were actually being swabbed, the nurse (Gaby) who administered the test was so energetic and positive, we actually had a good experience. I have nothing but good things to say about the staff at AFC Urgent Care on Shaw.<//Text><rating>5<//rating></record>

I had been to multiple other urgent cares before finally showing up to AFC & I am so thankful that I did not give up. I presented my symptoms & worries & Dr. Morrell Chhay quickly let me know what he thought was going on & how he was going to go about handling the situation. I came into the clinic in pain & upset at how I had been treated at the other Urgent cares & Dr. Chhay reminded me to be my strongest advocate & how it is his job to find the issue because I know my body best. Because of him I did not give up on finding the issue & it led me to finding a long term treatment plan. Thank you 🙏🏼!</review>

<text>Went to this urgent care because I had pain and swelling in my throat area that caused tightness. The doctor told me it was swelling of my lymph nodes and to put heat on it for 15 minutes and take pain meds. The next day I went to a different urgent care and found out I have thyroglossal duct cyst and to NOT put heat on it. I may need surgery. So yea, there’s pretty much that. Will not be returning.< /text></record>

<Text>Came in at 7:15pm  they refused to help my dad that was hurting from an arm pain, they said they won’t help him because their provider is not seeing anyone because there is only an hour left until they close.

Very rude staff, as I was convincing my father to go to ER they tried to kick us out. People that rush to go home shouldn’t work for the health care and helping others.

Don’t recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>< Resp>

< review>
Getting my first jab of Moderna's vaccine at AFC Urgent Care in Fresno CA was quite a breeze (easy, i.e.).  I searched for a place where vaccination is currently being done through the Fresno County web page and found AFC UC, which was near my home and served by a FAX bus service.  I reserved an open slot and got the first jab ALL on the same day, April 2.  The online application process was quite convenient, easy to do using my smartphone.  It only took about 10-15 minutes waiting time in a lobby area with plenty of seats, lots of good outdoor lighting through glass windows, quite roomy and very tidy.  The person who gave the shot was quite efficient and I barely felt the jab.  Afterwards, I stayed at the lobby for about 20 minutes, as advised by the staff.  So far, 2 days later, the slight soreness on my left arm is gone and thankfully no complications, so far, whatsoever.  I highly recommend AFC Urgent Care.  Thank you very much, and I'm looking forward to my second vaccine jab.< /review>

Covid testing that is easy, fast, organized, and streamlined. Making an appointment online was very easy. The call back after the appointment was made was very professional. Drive through was quick and easy. Results within a few hours. As good as it can get. Much appreciated. I will refer anyone I know to use services here for covid testing.<//Review>

Exceptional! The entire staff from the moment I arrived to meeting the Drs and staff the entire team was hands down the Most Exquisite Urgent Care I have visited!!
I saw the PA Robin who was so caring, compassionate, eager to aid and understand my ailments to find a diagnosis. She made me feel so comfortable and was super knowledgeable.
Then Dr. Chhay saw me and was just as stellar. He communicated thoroughly with PA Robin regarding all my health issues. Very insightful, patient in explaining my condition and treatments. Dr Chhay was also considerate regarding my services being out-of-pocket and was sensitive, on his own accord, to go over x-rays costs while working with me collectively and always having my best interest in mind.
Dr Chhay also showed me all my X-rays and explained everything thoroughly and was so compassionate to my needs.
Last but not least, Gloria (Medical Assistant and X-Ray Tech) was so pleasant, thoughtful and warm as she welcomed me from the waiting room, administered my X-rays and graciously helped me upon my departure. She was very intuitive and sympathetic to my condition. Her energy, personality, gentle ways and kindness where most appreciated. She also took excellent X-rays and made the whole experience easy on me.
Truly hands down the best team I have ever seen in the medical field and wish they could be my GP Office as this team was so efficient and effective while putting me at ease with their level of compassionate calming and understanding ways.
Lastly, the office was superior by way of cleanliness, high tech equipment and up to date practices.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Five star all around! Thank you to all who assisted me, as I am most thankful and grateful to each of you!🙏🏻❤️</Review>

Dr. Simranjit Kaur and Staff at AFC are amazing! I went in with a concern and did a follow up the next day and doc was able to give me an accurate diagnosis and a solution to my health issue. Very professional and accurate, helpful staff. They will recommend the best possible treatment and guidance.</Review>

<Review>Charged/collected co-pay for a telephone call, not a doctor's visit. Offered a COVID test that takes 3 days to process and advised me not to go to the ER for medical treatment, that the ER (hospital emergency room) would not see me or provide me medical treatment. For the record, I never had COVID. DO NOT SEEK MEDICAL CARE HERE.</Review><user>104807177381395518383<//user><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< date>

This place is a joke. I made an appt online for a rapid covid test. They never called at the appointed time. I even received a confirmation e mail. When I called they said they couldn't find my info.

You have an option to text office for appointment👍 The office is clean, front and back office staff were nice,  helpful, and actually listened to my concerns.. Dr Simranjit Kaur's bedside manner is a perfect example of Doctor patient relationship in my opinion. She addressed my concerns and was very honest with other possible outcomes for my situation. Doctor knew I was worried about blood work, she called me when results were in to ease my mind and follow up on my health.
Thank you Doctor Kaur and Staff for your part in making me feel safe and taken care of...<//Review>

I was so impress with this site. I went to them in a lot of pain. My Dr said it was nothing and they did lab tests.  Well it was an UTI,  I knew it. They found it. They retested and sent out to another lab, as well as testing on site.
This office is so clean. All the Staff were very pleasant. and made my visit and pain more tolerable.  Thank You ,Thank You. They even called me and asked how i was doing, and wanted to change my Medication. I really liked Dr Chhay.
They give you a print out when you leave.With all your symptoms,and the The Test They Did and Ordered. The Prescriptions they gave YOU . Printed Home care, and web site for you to learn more about your Diagnosis. And when you should call for help.
I AM Impresses ,Impressed , and felling better< /review>

They said they didn't allow guests in the waiting room because they are reducing the risk of the covid and I needed to wait outside. I have no ac. The asked the manager and she made an exception because it wasn't busy inside and was extremely hot outside. I'll  start by saying the staff are wonderful. To bad they couldn't be the only ones we had to deal with. The wait was long and the facility was hot. The manager offered me water and told me they were getting blinds to block the heat and couldn't stop apologizing for the heat and the wait.She was a kind soul. But there is a man who works there who speaks to the staff like they are dirt. Has no kind of customer service and all he does is yell out demands to the staff to get things done. HE IS HORRIBLE!!!! He has no place when working with staff that stay focused and work. From the time I was there until we left the staff worked hard and non stop. No talking except when the manager ask if they are okay and to check on me and still smiled through it all. You Mr. man in the office, I think you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, do not know how to treat people, you have a big head and are full of yourself!! RUDE RUDE RUDE. For those reasons I will be sure that you get none of our families or friends business.< /Review>< Time>

The staff were professional when talking to me.  The provider was thorough and took a good amount of time with me.  They definitely try harder than other places that don't care.</Text>

<Text>Sunday July 19th 2020, was the first time coming into this office. The lady at the front desk was really nice, welcoming and respectful. We was greeted in a professional way and called by our names. Treated respectful by the Doctor also.
The office was clean and smelled clean also. Everything was sanitized.
The only thing that I can complain of is that the office was a little hot. Because the sun is facing the office. And the time seeing the Dr was kinda long. Was told that the office just opened and there was kinks... Which was no problem😊. Will recommend to Family and Friends! 5 STARS LOVE THIS PLACE!
They also take Medi-Cal.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>My wife made me an appointment and when I got there they told me to registered for covid testing. Unaware that my wife had already registered me they ask me to email my insurance card which i did while in their parking lot. Staff member outside ask me to go back at a later time because i wasnt registered. After wasting that much of my time i will not go back. If you arent doing the rapid test which is $150 and isnt covered by your insurance you might just get cancelled on. I will take my business elsewhere. Im not about to waste anymore of my time and money to a place that dont appreciate it. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE.My wife made an appointment for herself as well and never received a call back from them. I will be testing every week and will think less about this place when i take my business to other places.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1604376963508, 'text': "Hello, we apologize for your experience.

I booked a 1045 appointment on saturday for sunday. Talked to a staff member to confirm and was told since it was after 10 I would not be seen until approx 1pm. Its Sunday 415 and no one has called me or anything and they have not answered there lines to day. I was promised to be seen to day and nothing. I understand they are very busy I could wait but not being able to be seen at all on the day the appointment was is not good. I was wanting the rapid rest, I'm sorry but I will have to go elsewhere in the morning. Thank you AFC.<//Text>

Went in the other day to get tested for Covid. This test can make grown men cry, lol (see YouTube). Gabby came out to administer the test and she was amazing! Thank you Gabby, for being positive in a crazy situation.</Text>

Was told to get my blood ox checks here by my insurance, won't even see me unless I have negative covid test results in hand. Made me wait outside while they registered me, and then they called me and told me I wouldn't be getting seen today at all. Thanks for wasting my time while I'm sick and in need and then turning me away.<//text>

<username>Frances Trudeau< /username>< Review>
I went in due to a scratch on my face. I was seen by Dr. Kaur Simranjit. She was one of the best doctors I have ever seen. She evaluated my face and let me know that it was infected. I let her know that I was also experiencing blurry vision in my eye right above the scratch so she evaluated my eye. She didn’t see anything wrong with it at first so she offered to do a more intense exam which included putting drops in my eye and using a blue light to detect any scratches. I said yes and after she did the exam she let me know that my eye was in fact scratched. She prescribed me some medication to heal this infection on my face and gave me medication to heal my eye and stop any infection that might spread. I had no issues with the people in the front either they were all very friendly and kept asking me if I needed anything. I didn’t have a copayment thank goodness. I highly recommend this urgent care over any other ones in the Fresno area.< /Review>

This is the best Urgent Care around. Everyone who works here is super nice and knows what they're doing, they get you in and out relatively fast, AND they ACTUALLY LISTEN! I also have to say the staff here is better than the Clovis Community ER any day. They told us my son's problem wasn't anything major and not to come back and AFC told us to come back if we need to after helping him. Best customer service and just all around care. It really felt like they care about the patients. I've never experienced that with an Urgent Care before yesterday. I recommend this place to everyone.< /text>

It was easy to sign up, take the test and get results.  I was a bit uneasy about these special travel arrangements to go to Maui, but they helped make it painless (well, except for the swabbing).<//Review>

After waiting for 1 hour i was told that they did not take my insurance Aetna. I found this facility on the insurance company website as an in-network location. After about 30 mins on the phone with my insurance they verified  i was at the correct location. They had to talk to the person behind the counter to get this issue resloved. Not sure what they did wrong no explanation was given to me. Now  i wasted a hour an a half when I could've been seen earlier. Due to some error. Thr Dr was great though thanks<//Review>

You might have experienced nasopharyngeal swab in the past that went way up and past your nostrils. These newer swabs are nasal swabs and do not need to go that high in your nostrils. Also, our analyzers will kick the sample out if there was not enough good sample. We'd be happy to discus this in more detail over the phone if you would like. Please contact us at 559-388-8430 Ext 105. Thank you!"}< /response>

Ate here for the first time tonight-- service and food both excellent. Tiny indoors, about 8-10 tables, but also tables on the patio out front. Four of us, had spaghetti & meatballs, two mini-pizzas, and Caesar salad w/parmesan chicken. Everything was pronounced quite tasty and fresh. Service was friendly and fairly fast. They also deliver, which we will definitely take advantage of in future. A nice neighborhood discovery!<//text>

Impressive food, fantastic service, and a staff that makes you feel like family. I tried their delicious BBQ chicken personal pizza and the portion size was perfect. I'll definitely be going back for more.<//review>

<review>Very small place for eating in. I usually get take out. Their bruschetta is fantastic! It's kind of like a french bread pizza but with fresh tomatoes instead of sauce. Good salads and the pizza is a bit different but good.<//review>< Response>

Great meatball sandwich, and if you don't try an order of their bruschetta you are definitely missing the Nuccis experience. I don't know if you have had a restaurant ruin a dish for you by making it so much better than anywhere else, but I can't order bruschetta anywhere else now.< /Text>

< review>
We took our granddaughter Lily to Topline Autoplex LLC In Fontana to look for a vehicle. It was our last stop in a very long day. We were tired and frustrated but nevertheless browsed in hopes of finding “the” car. We took a ride in several vehicles and finally Lily found the one she liked. She chose the White 2010 Toyota Corolla. The gentleman that helped us was Benny. He was very busy but was friendly and helpful. He accepted our offer and started the paperwork and we were finished in about an hour. He wished us well and prior to leaving he gave Lily a gas card to fill up her tank. While the lot was full of cars Benny managed to move those rather quickly so that people could test drive the vehicle. Thank you for your your help, kindness and patience Benny. We had a favorable experience.< /review>

Thankfully, he was willing to work with us on an okay price. The mechanics and car washers were very very kind though and ensured our experience wasn't so bad :). They let us test drive the car. The car, after a brief inspection, seemed okay... it had a small oil leak, a bit of shock leak, and a few scratches/minor rust. Otherwise, very clean. The price of the car was very high but somewhat understandable. Overall, an okay experience. If the salesman wasn't so rude, I would say 5 stars!

If you want good service, please avoid this place. The salesman even left during our initial transaction a few minutes before closing time. The mechanic took over and was very good. Otherwise, eh.

Kudos to the mechanics and car washers.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c34cff60c1b7a5:0x2c4d39fd949f58c2< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Bought a Nissan Rogue 2014. Price was fair. On the day I took it home, I noticed severe transmission issues but I called Kenny for help. I took it back and he got it fixed. Then I had a tire issue. He got that fixed as well even though it was not engine or transmission related (he agreed to fix it because it was flat before I Bought it). Reason I’m giving 5stars is because Kenny never tried to weasel his way out of fixing the issue. He was nice about everything, and worked with my financial situation. Also, when I first went in, I also have to say I didn’t feel pressured and was not followed around. The mechanic who works there simply gave my spouse the keys and told us to feel free and test drive it. I felt trusted and comfortable. :) super happy with the experience.< /Review>

Just bought a 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4x4. They were a big help and they brought the price down for me! I really appreciate their help! The dealership was great and they even helped with my trade-in. No problems at all. I will definitely be back after the experience I had. Good price on vehicles as well.

<review>We were very impressed with the efficiency of the purchasing process. We knew what make and model of car we wanted, saw it in line, called to make sure it was still available, test drove it, decided on a price... 10 minutes later we exchanged cash for keys! Super happy.< /review>< Time>

Ben is a great salesman!
Drove in from San Diego and they agreed to fair price over email and had all the paperwork ready to go! No hassle and we were in and out within 1/2 an hour! This is the way car buying should be!
Great cars at a great price and helpful people.
After a bad experience buying another used car at a large dealership a month previous this was a welcome change. Keep up the good work!</review><user>108449703418553943712< /user></record></dataset><record>

He even took me on a test drive. I drove away that night with my SUV at a great rate and no hassle. All my questions were answered and the dealership honored where I needed to be payment wise. I felt valued, respected, and honored. Highly recommend this dealership and my awesome sales guy Joseph!</review>< Pics>

<text>My husband and I came just to test drive a car we liked without intention to buy, but found a car we really loved. Ben took us for a test drive and was very nice about everything and helpful. We met with sales manager Kenny to ask a few questions and to get a quote. He was so extremely helpful and very low pressure. He made us feel very welcome and convinced us to buy. Manager Crystal finished us up with our paperwork and was so amazing and such a pleasure to talk to. Everyone at this location was so nice and helpful. Thank you Topline Autoplex!!!<//text>< Date>

I had an amazing experience at Topline Auto. They gave me a great deal on my used car.I honestly can't say enough good things about Kenny and his staff at Topline. From the moment I first contacted them with questions about my future car to the instant I set my foot on the lot, everyone was so accommodating and answered all my questions without hesitation. am so in love with my car. i will recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a car.</Text>

<text>I found this dealer through CarGuru and decided to visit the dealer to see what they had in stock. Test drove a few cars and fell in love with an 09 GTI. I came back a few weeks later with the down payment. I knew finding a bank wanting to finance me would be difficult but Kenny was able to pull it off and get me in the car I wanted at the payments I wanted. The car needed a new tint job and he was happy to do it before I purchased the car. I would recommend you swing by this place and check it out.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I recently purchased a 2012 Volkswagen Passat, and had a mother great purchasing experience. This is the third car I have purchased from them in the past couple years, and I would not hesitate to refer them to a friend. The salesman was extremely helpful and answered all my questions. They were not pushy at all. I've purchased from other dealers in the past, but Topline has always been the best in my opinion. And their selections is second to none.<//Text>

I was told it by Kenny that it was my fault, but I've been driving a manual transmission car for years, and I've never had a problem with any other transmission like I did with this one. Also, after they took it to their own mechanic, the engine blew up and I looked under the car and the pressure plate was completely trashed. Kenny doesn't want to cover me when I have the warranty on it still...overall I would never trust this dealership ever again, they are shady and won't admit or compensate for their mistakes.< /review>< pictures>

TOPLINE AUTO CENTER is the best!
Not only because they have multiple good auto choices, their team members are fantastic, very helpful and don't pressured clients. After visiting several dealerships I personally recommend Topline Auto Center the most . Thanks guys for helping me and I love my new car 2014 Nissan Altima 💓.< /Review>

<review>Very rude. Will rip you off. EVERY CAR and when i say EVERY i mean it, is in terrible shape. Kenny will rip you off. Only reason they have 5 star reviews are because they give you a $50 gas card if you do. I will not leave them there 5 stars if i could i would give them 0. Avoid this place and i mean it. Look for better deals somewhere else.  Fyi did not buy a car here, went somewhere else and i hope you do too.< /review>< pics>

{'time': 1544655230699, 'text': 'Hi edwin,\n\nI just saw you left a review about me and the dealership and I just wanted to see if I can sort out any confusions during the time you were here. I recall that I’ve made a mistake of entering your moms ITN number as SSN and got an lower apr the it should and that’s the reason you rejected the finance. I apologize for the confusion I had caused in regards to that.\n\nIf you have not purchased a car somewhere else already, I would like to ask for another chance to offer my services of finding you the best possible financing for you and your mom. If not then I just wanted to apologize for the misunderstanding and wish you the best. It was never my intentions to misinform you or cause any hardship for you or your family. My job as a car salesman is to sell you the car you want with the best terms to meet your needs. It doesn’t benefit me in anyway to increase your interest rate and lose the sale. We do not profit from the interest rates from financing as those were set and collected by the bank.\n\nI sincerely hope you would understand and hope that I have somewhat cleared the confusion between us. We never ask customers to leave a 5 star ratings in order to receive the gas card. We do this as an incentive to the customer and to increase our online exposure. It is solely their own decision of whether they want to leave a 5 star or any star rating for our service.\n\nKenny'}</Response>

<review>This place is a complete disaster, the customer service is trash. I purchased a car here and was very disappointed, the transmission had blown a week after purchase date. The owner of the shop known as Kenny recommended me to his mechanic where he had refused to pay for the damage to the car as well as verbally abusing me after explaining the damage was not done by myself. I do not recommend this place what so ever!!!!</review><Response>None</Response>< Date>

Drove 70 miles to look at a 2006 mazda3.  Got there at 930am and was told that the guy who has access to the keys wasnt in yet (they open at 9am).  Found the car i wanted to see and noticed it was priced on the lot for $1500 more than it was listed online.  I was told that the online price was for cash only and that the online price was the lowest the owner would go.  It would be nice to mention that clearly on the website.  Not to mention that even the online price was a thousand over blue book.  No thanks.
RESPONSE TO THE OWNERS RESPONSE:
There was no misunderstanding between me and your salesperson.  Your salesperson told me what I detailed above.  The vehicle had 6995 listed on it when I arrived when it is listed online for 5500.  The only misunderstanding lies between you and your salesperson.  Not only that but why do I have to make an appointment?  Are you a doctors office or a car dealership?  The saddest part about the entire situation is that we were planning to drive the car home..guess it wasn't meant to be....</review>

{'time': 1488834920907, 'text': "Thank you for your feedback. We could've helped you better if you had scheduled an appointment with us in advance before you came down. The price of the vehicle was no difference than the online price regardless if it was cash or not. Please do not hesitate to give us a call to clarify the misunderstanding between you and the salesperson. We will be glad to help you here for all your future car buying needs."}</response>

<Review>This place ONLY sells junk.
Bought a vehicle and financed through "their" to-go lender.
What a joke, 1st thing I had to do was an oil change because they put the wrong oil in it, could have blown the motor.
2nd thing had to replace was the starter after it left me stranded, 65.- towing and $250.- for the starter.
3rd, water pump went out, also had to change all the hoses, another $350.- out of pocket.
4th, the left front wheel hub had to be replaced, there was another 325.-.
5th, mechanic now says front end needs complete rebuild, that is now estimated at $2700.-.
6th, the fuel pump just went out, so now it sits in the back yard and Ihave no Fn vehicle.
The list goes on, I think you get the idea.
DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.
And yes, they give you $50.- to write a good review.
Just replaced the radiator, too!!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><rating>1</rating>< name>

I got my eyebrows threaded here and had a great experience. Friendly and fast, clean and professional. I felt like she really took the time and knew what she was doing, and provided individualized care for what your brows and face need. She was friendly and I will definitely come back, thanks!<//review>

<review>Took my 14 yr old to get threaded for the 1st time. We had a great experience! Luckily they had a cancellation and were able to take us. Due to covid I waited outside but we told them we just wanted a simple clean up. They did them perfect!! Even called me from outside to see 1 brow before moving onto the next. My daughter and I were impressed with the whole process and the work looks great and natural!! We will be forever clients and we will make an appt for the next visit because they do get busy! Thank you Maya's Eyebrow Threading!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I was referred by a friend to get my eye brows threaded. I got it done by Maya herself and Sara. They both did a great job and were super friendly.
I then saw that they offer facials, so I thought I’d give it a try. I got my facial done by Charmane and she is by far the only esthetician that has walked me through and introduced me to a skin regimen that my skin so far is loving. She is very thorough, and educates me with every product and treatment she performs. If you need your eyebrows done and a facial this is hands down the place to go.</review>

<text>I came In for a facial treatment. The place was very clean and took the precautions needed during the Covid situation. Charmane was very friendly and knowledgeable about skincare. The whole process was very calming. She explained what each product was that she was applying to my face, how it would feel and what it actually does to help my skin. In the end my face felt amazing! A few days later (which is today and the reason why I’m writing this review) I saw results in areas where I have acne and scarring (where she focused on!) Definitely going back to her to keep my face maintained!!< /text>< Pictures>

My facial was amazing and the licensed Esthetician Charmane,  was so sweet and extremely knowledgeable of how to care for my skin type.  I have very dry and slightly sensitive skin. After my facial, my face felt so clean. My skin has never looked so good! I saw improvement in my skin going once a month for 3 months and following the daily facial routine using Dermodality products.

I've been a client of Maya's threading and skincare services for 3 months and I wouldn't think of going anywhere else for a facial or skin treatment.  I trust Charmane 100% with my skin. As i stated before, she is knowledgeable, professional and takes such good care of me. The setting of Maya's threading and skincare services is elegant, clean and up to code regarding the whole Covid situation.  All the staff are welcoming and amazing.

I highly recommend booking your skincare services at Maya's Threading and skincare Services with Esthetician Charmane!<//Text>

This is the best brow place to go to! Maya does an amazing job and I always leave with my brows looking good! 10/10 would recommend for anyone to come here! There is the best deal right now for their grand opening with $10 for the brow and lip.</Review>

Less expensive gas comparatively speaking. Basic quick stop supplies and snacks. Pump area is always crowded. No windshield cleaning supplies.  Masks required for service.  Pump area dirty, wear gloves.<//review>

L&L consistently gives one of the lowest prices in town.  The facility is clean and easy to get in and out.  One time I forgot to get my change of $60.00 back.  As I was about to leave the owner ran out and handed me the cash due.  Great place to fill up!<//Review>

Very good gas prices here. That's why I keep coming back... Arco gas across the street is usually 40 cents higher. Convenience store seems to have a fair amount of stock, however I have never purchased anything except gas.<//Text>

<Review>Even when the gas station is closed you can still get gas at the pump using a credit card.  Sadly it is a little unfair to charge a fee for using a card at the pump.   Sometimes it can be a pain in the backside after paying at the pump to go in to get a receipt inside the store because there is not receipt paper in the pump.   If it was occasional it would be one thing but it's regular.  Staff though are polite.</Review><time>1480647500802</time><Gmap_id>0x80db6f658246601f:0x3b85736fd8f13be3</Gmap_id>< Rate>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>If I could not select a star I would not. Zero stars is my true opinion of this place. The lady that operates the store is constantly trying to over charge the customers. Keep an eye on the register and the price stamp indicated on the product you buy. It is her common practice and not just an accidental one time circumstance. I will not be going there for any purchases again.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< review>
I would give this store the worst rating in town !!! I went in on 10//3/15 to get $15.00 for gas, a pack of smokes and a drink, the receipt said $22.00 but later I checked my visa card and it said this store took out $59.00 !!! It cleaned out my card leaving me $3.00 !!! I went back to tell them and the older lady (who was very rude to me as if I was lying)  at the counter said it was the fault of the card.. not the store... I talked to another man who works there and he said the same thing and that my card would show a credit back on it in a few days.  I even let the man from the store talk to the agent with the card who told the store worker that they needed to refund me because this store charged $59.00... the workers still refused to refund me and will not tell me who is the owner or boss of this establishment.  I can not believe that these workers in this store can continue to get by with this.... they are making 1000's of dollars doing this to our cards !!!!!< /review>

While I would usually not review a business until all dealings have been done, I make an exception for Extra space Storage, Main St. Manteca. Fair price for the size and location, friendly service from Cindy-Lou. Quick and efficient. Clean facility. A little tight getting a twenty six foot rental truck in and out but manageable.  I expect  the good service and security will continue throughout the rental process and would recommend.<//Text>

Needed a storage unit quickly and close to my home so I walked in to see if they had something tha t fit my needs. The lady (sorry i forgot her name but i will find out and update this review)who helped me out was knowledgeable and gave it to me straight  no BS. Signed me up and got me out the door right into my new nicely swept and cleaned unit. Excelent customer service.</Text>

The owner is amazing and very responsive. My family has moved multiple times and Extra Space Storage has always been extremely helpful and accommodating.
We asked for a last minute storage 20 minutes before closing and the owner was very quick and helpful in setting up the process and we were able to move the rest of our items.
I really appreciate the cleanliness and price of this place and my family will always continue to do business here.</review>

< Review>
The whole experience was so simple, I was able to do it all online and even receive my gate code in a text so I could utilize the facility right away and they even supplied me with a new lock for free. The. facility is very clean, well lit and has access until 10pm.  The best part of the whole experience was Cindy Lou the on-site manager...she was very friendly & went out of her way to make things easy & stress free.< /Review>

I felt 100% comfortable when I had called and especially when I initially visited this facility.
Roberta was a big in finding the proper storage unit I was searching for. She has provided all the details, costs, and etc. No questions were left unanswered.
Cindy-lou was also a kind person. Once I had finished offloading my things into my storage unit, she came by and was very personable as well as answered any last minute questions I had thought of. I recommend that if anyone is looking for a storage facility/unit that they start here and end up here!<//review>< rating>

Highly recommend! Cindy-lou was very helpful and welcoming. She was able to answer all of our questions and gave us all the information we needed. When my mother and I stopped by, she was the only worker there receiving calls, helping others finding their storage unit, and she was still able to help us. Excellent service!<//text>

I had the pleasure of being greeted by Cindy Lou. She was beyond pleasant and efficient. She was knowledgeable and answered all my questions thoroughly.

The place was clean and tidy and the unit was available and exactly what I expected. I would highly recommend Extra Space Storage to anyone in the Manteca area.< /Text>

We recently had to do research for a Storage Facility. When we finally got to Extra Space Storage in Manteca, we were so happy.  Roberta was the wonderful woman who helped us.  She worked with us until we were able to get what we were looking for.  She kept us informed, and every time we talked or met in person, she was so kind, considerate and knowledgeable.  We are happy we had Roberta help us with our storage needs. Thank you.</Review>

When I showed up to extra space storage and met Cindy, i calmed right down. She was so helpful and understanding of my situation, and did everything she could to help me with moving my items in. She even came by my unit a few times to bring me water and see if she could help me in any way. I highly recommend extra space storage in Manteca, and very highly recomend Cindy!!

<Date>1508986253028<//Date><rating>5<//rating><text>I'm not one to write business reviews but I had such a positive experience here that I feel compelled to share my experience.  My wife and I have passed by this place for many years but have never had the need for extra storage space.  Without going into details, we recently had a family member that needed a lot of household items put into a storage facility. We debated about whether to give up our own garage space or consider renting a storage facility.  Our own garage would be an easy choice but it also meant giving up our space -- which we weren't too fond of (especially my wife.)  We decided to check out Extra Space Storage on Main St. and I couldn't be happier that we did.  We had no idea how it worked or what our options were.  We met with a woman (I think her name was Roberta?) that was incredibly helpful and supportive, particularly given we had no idea what we were doing and the family situation we were dealing with.  She really helped us get a better grasp on what our storage size needs might be as well as providing us detailed information about security, access, etc.  We were so impressed that we didn't even look at other facilities and have moved all the items into storage.  We've been back several times and always have great interactions with the staff. In fact, I think we may consider renting another space for some unused items we currently have in our home but aren't quite ready to part with. I'm just really impressed with this facility and our interaction with the staff.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Roberta is AMAZING. Top tier customer service, helped reassure that our items were in great care after a severely negative experience at a different storage location. We had a very detailed walk through, and tour of facility. From what I seen this location really keeps organized. Every time I come they are in the middle of keeping the site clean. I will be recommending fam and friends!< /text>< Pictures>

Reasonable and reliable service. Courteous and respectful the whole time. No complaints here.

I have now been renting here for over 7 months and have no complaints. The only reason I am leaving today is because I have to move across the country. Excellent service and reliable security. Definitely worth the money.<//review>

We recently downsized our storage and it was very stressful.  With the help of Cindy-Lou and Roberta we were able to make our transition with a little more ease.  We cant thank them enough for helping us with our move.  They were very professional and very personable.  Thanks again Extra Space Storage...you guys are awesome.</Text>

Its was this time last year while working in Denver Co. that I had an opportunity to work with Cindy Lou. I'm a driver and my schedule is quite fluid and can change in an instance. One minute I was told I would be working in Denver and the next minute I was back in Manteca CA. Once told I would be working in Denver, I called and reserved a rental space from Cindy. and then it all changed. Cindy Lou worked with me and got all funds returned back to my accounts.
Now I'm having to a need for space again, and again, Cindy Lou was there for me. The property is very visible, clean and well secured. I feel very comfortable storing my possessions there. Thanks Cindy Lou.<//text>< Pics>

The ring literally arrived days before I had to fly to Jamaica. ...wow...this service really saved my #!!!!....I appreciate all the help the staff gave me very professional and courteous.

Very friendly and helpful. While I initially posted 5 stars, I dropped to 3. They have rodent issues there and despite me seeing a rodent in my unit and reporting it to the staff, nothing was done proactively to make sure my unit was free of rodents. As a result my washing machine was severely damaged by the rodent chewing up all my pipes. While they did take care of me with the insurance, very discouraging that nothing was done to prevent this issue once reported.<//text>

I needed some space for the extra things that were cluttering up my garage.  Cindy-Lou greeted me warmly at the desk.  She explained the different sizes and prices.  I choose a 5 x 10.  I was then driven on a golf cart to see my new space.  The space was very clean.  It will be nice to get my garage back.< /text>

I recently used Extra Space Storage on Main St. Manteca to store items which were taking up too much space in my garage.  I chose this location as it appeared clean and well maintained.  Cindy the Manager greeted me as soon as i entered and was very helpful as she explained fees and a tour of the facility.

Each time i have entered the facility to access my unit i have observed her or one of the workers cruising around which provided an extra level of security in addition to the cameras and alarms.  I would recommend this facility for storing any of your personal items.<//Text>

<text>We moved from a home of 30 years and needed to store everything for over 4 months. Cindy-Lou and Roberta were super helpful and made a stressful time much easier. The facility is kept extremely clean and security is top notch. Definitely recommend Extra Space Storage in Manteca.< /text><user>116975708924046647236< /user>< gmapID>

We moved from a home of 30 years and needed to store everything for over 4 months. Cindy-Lou and Roberta were super helpful and made a stressful time much easier. The facility is kept extremely clean and security is top notch. Definitely recommend Extra Space Storage in Manteca.< /Text>

<Review>The people at Extra Space Storage were very helpful and friendly.  I had reserved a unit on-line.  When I got there the gentleman took us around to the unit which was reserved for us and asked if the size was ok.  I told him we would need a bigger unit.  He took us to see the next largest unit.  There was no problem in changing my request.  The location was perfect and the facility was very clean.  Being able to give them just a few days notice prior to vacating was great.  Most facilities require a 30-day notice.  If I have to store items again I would definitely go there first and if I know of anyone needing storage, I would definitely recommend Extra Space Storage.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Everything I write here is true. Yeah the lady is friendly but when you open up an account with them I think she plays dumb. The reason they have so many reviews on Google is because once you're done purchasing a unit, she literally will keep nagging you to write a review. I'm pissed because they repainted the pavement and got one of those blowers and blew dust and rocks all over my belongings. Also they are pretty overpriced< /Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Name>Eric Carey<//Name><Review>If you need storage in Manteca, see Cindy Lou and Nick at Extra Space storage! It was closing time when I came to Nick about storing my old Chevy there. He didn't mind taking the time to set me up with the current special and moving me in. They treated my old Chevy like it was brand new! If the car cover blew off, they would put it back on for me so I wouldn't have to come down there every few days. I have never had this level of service at any storage facility, and I have used quite a few from GA to CA. I will definitely use this location again if needed.< /Review>< Rating>

This place is the best storage facility I've used. The people are friendly and the closing process is not complicated like other storage facilities in Manteca. I recommend this place for your storage needs!<//text>

Clean Facility, and great lighting. I had my unit for about 5 months when I was moving from one house to another. Staff was super friendly and made the stressful time of moving and organizing easier as it was one less thing to worry about.< /Review>

I would like to compliment your choice of personal as Cindy and  Nick are a benefit to the company. On the 22  of this month our home burned down, we lost everything. So we thought. There were something's in our shed to which the fire didn't get. Cindy took care of all that was needed over the phone. When I went into the office I met Nick. He was professional yet friendly. Helping  to make to make this much easier. Thank you both....bc< /Text>

I had  thought I locked up my storage unit one day and didn’t realize I had left it unlock until the lovely ladies at extra space Manteca off of south Main Street notified me and insured me that they would look after my unit until I was able to stop by and correctly lock my unit.</text>

Above and beyond is all I can say when it comes to Cindy and Nick at Extra Space Storage . I left Ca . to move south to escape a terrible situation . 3 weeks after moving I was involved in a awful car accident . So my plan to go back 2 months later to get my belonging was ruined . I was unable to walk for months, no job , no income and my saving dwindling away . Worrying monthly I would loose my belongings . Cindy & Nick worked with me monthly during my struggles . Always understanding and having compassion never making me feel ashamed for asking for extra time to pay . I'm happy to report my life has turned around and I just got my belonging . I'm so impressed that after almost 2 years my stuff was in perfect condition . I believe that is due to the conditions of ESS being secure, clean , well maintained . ESS was  so accommodating ( I was given after hours access to my storage when moving ). If you are looking for a great place to store your belongings I highly recommend ESS I can't imagine being disappointed with Cindy and Nick operating this location . Thanks Extra Space Storage, Cindy and Nick you made a bad situation bearable  : )<//Review>

<Review>Cindy and Nick at Extra Space Storage in Manteca made a tough situation easier for us so we're delighted to have done business with them and would like to recommend them to others!!  In short, we drove some personal and household stuff up from Southern California for a relative who was relocating to the Manteca area from the East Coast.  We rented a unit at ESS in Manteca for one month and sent our relative the key via certified mail.  That gave him 30 days to retrieve the stuff at his leisure.  Everything worked perfectly and that's largely because of the staff at Extra Space Storage in Manteca.  They listened to our needs and worked with us to devise a plan that would work for everyone.<//Review><Date>1351275179562< /Date>< response>

<Text>Cindy and Nick at Extra Space Storage in Manteca made a tough situation easier for us so we're delighted to have done business with them and would like to recommend them to others!!  In short, we drove some personal and household stuff up from Southern California for a relative who was relocating to the Manteca area from the East Coast.  We rented a unit at ESS in Manteca for one month and sent our relative the key via certified mail.  That gave him 30 days to retrieve the stuff at his leisure.  Everything worked perfectly and that's largely because of the staff at Extra Space Storage in Manteca.  They listened to our needs and worked with us to devise a plan that would work for everyone.<//Text>< userid>

My husband and I chose this unit because it was the cheapest out of all the storage units in our area. It's only been a few months and we just got a notice in the mail they are increasing our monthly rate by ten perent! This is not acceptable.< /Review>
