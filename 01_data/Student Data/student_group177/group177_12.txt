< Review>
Terrible customer service; employee acted incredibly put out that I had questions about their products and actively discouraged me from purchasing any available alternatives. This was after he shamed me for coming in with a partial can of Sherwin-Williams oil paint from out of state for color matching. It’s oil-based paint, not asbestos or illegal drugs. Maybe dude had low blood sugar or something. It was all-in-all an icky experience. I spent my $$ at Benjamin Moore and had a lovely experience there. I am no longer a Sherwin-Williams customer after this one. Yikes.<//Review>

The best part is they keep a history of the paint you buy, so you don't have to save paint chips or samples in case you need to do a touch up down the road.

Went in 2 minutes before 5pm and the refused to help me so I had to return in the morning to pick up the 1 can of paint that I needed.  The 1 can was very expensive and I found that it doesn't even provide the coverage I'd expect for the price I paid.  A better value can be found sadly at the big box stores.</review>

The attendant on that day was super cheerful,  helpful, and gave me good recommendations.  He did not upsell me,  advising me to go with middle of the pack paint choices.  He also helped carry paint to car for me.< /review>

<Review>I came in with tiny paint scraps trying to figure out what colors the previous owners had used.  The SW staff actually found the house in the data base and were able to tell me exactly what colors to buy!!  Can you believe this??  Why would you go anywhere else.  I have been wondering for years why people in paint and hardware have not kept a database.  Talk about value add!!  Tell me how I can spread the word!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

They take the time to help you and answer all your questions. Don't just buy paid there, also get your brushes and such -  many of the items are competitively priced with those know-nothing god awful Home Depot (which has gone to complete hell the last ten years)< /Text>

<username>anirudha bapat<//username><Text>Recently moved into this apartment community from another Prometheus property- Orchard Glen. Our move was quite seamless even during pandemic times.

I Had few parking spot issues initially but management took care of it and gave a convenient spot! Thanks Melissa.

This community truly is a green, quiet and peaceful one.. landscaping is very attractive too.
They have Latch installed at this property which gives a sense of security even more.
Service technicians are quick and professional! Proximity to Central park is a plus.<//Text><time>1616709866881< /time>< response>

<text>Alderwood was a place we called home for a long time, we ended up moving on because we purchased a home. But our time was great there. The team particularly the maintenance crew headed up by Cruz Herrera, were always great. They always performed service requests timely and at high quality standards. Cruz was always super friendly to me, my fiancé and our dog Tilly. We’d run into him walking around the neighborhood and he would always stop to greet us and give Tilly a quick pet. Thanks Alderwood for taking care of us, we will always look back at our time there as a positive experience. Keep up the great work!< /text>< user_name>

Wonderful place to live. We spent our best 5 yrs living in this community. Very clean and great amenities. Closer to everything. Good and caring neighbors. Melissa and Israel helped us a lot and kept the bar high. The maintenance team especially "Cruz" is great. With him around, there was not even a single request which was pending for more than 2 days. His work was with high quality. We miss this community already :( All the best Alderwood team. Keep it up. Thanks...< /Text>

Lived here for a year. Pros:
1. Quiet location near playgrounds, Central Park, pretty good elementary school.
2. Lots of green areas, trees, flowers.
3. Big windows that give lots of light into rooms.
Cons:
1. For some reason the paint on the doors and kitchen cabinets was really bad - if you accidentally touch it with your nail it started to peel of - you can actually peel a whole door or cabinet without much efforts. If you put some package in the kitchen cabinet, next day you got it out from there with paint glued on it. Underneath - was old original paint with dirt from previous tenants. It was scary because we have a small kid (he was 1 year old at that time) who put everything in his mouth. Guess what, they charge us for repainting of it!
2. Reglazed baths - also some paint started to peel off. Guess what, they charged us for reglazing - 350$ per bathtub! At first they even charged us for the bathtub that already had cracked paint when we were moving in (ridiculous!), but then agreed to charge us only for the another one - the paint on which cracked just couple weeks after our move in. We didn’t do anything special to the bathtubs - just washed as usual.
3. During Fall and Winter months every day we woke up with wet windows. Big balcony door was the worst - it could be wet from top to the bottom. So every morning you have to start with a rag to wipe all the windows, otherwise mold would be growing really fast on the bottom of windows (even with wiping it still grew a little). Windows look dirty in the gap between two glasses and sometimes there is condensate inside this gap which you cannot wipe.
4. In the shower cabin mold started to grow from the gaps no matter how well you cleaned it (it was impossible to clean these gaps).
5. If your child accidentally left his toys somewhere on the green area for a night, very next morning a maintenance guy put all of them to the trash bag (I saw it with my own eyes when they throw away my child’s pail and freesbie early morning after the child left them last night! They definetly saw that children were playing there! They also make you to wash your child’s chalk paintings from the parking lots!
6. Reaaally reaaally slow at communications! Like you always had to remind them to answer your email, send couple of follow up emails. Once there was a planned water shut off for a day starting from 7 am. They notified us through email a week before and that was all, we didn’t paid attention to this email so woke up without water to go to the toilet or brush your teeth. I would expect some paper notification for this. They said that they are trying to be as much paperless. Yeah, but they didn’t forget to send us paper bills for payment. I guess water shut off just is not that important for them. They didn’t get us initial move out statement, said that will not charge us for bad paint and reglazing (we have email that confirm that) and then after we moved out to another state - charged all this and just stopped answering our emails. They just didn’t answer our email about the package that was accidentally sent to our old address after we moved out. All they care is just your money, nothing more.
7. A lot of different pests around: 1) we had a black bumble bee’s nest on our balcony; 2) both of my children and friend of us were stung by a bee on Alderwood green area (never happened to us before in California); 3) there’re lots of big cockroaches living near garbage containers, which you can see at night; 4) lots of spiders; 5) once I even saw a raccoon in a sewage near our apartment; 6) our neighbors had big cockroaches and rats at their apartment!
8. The pool was always cold. Even on the hottest days we had to warm up in a spa. I could compare with other property were we lived before - in Alderwood they don’t bother with warming it up properly. Complains didn’t help.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Tea Sites is the absolute best Leasing Consultant of Prometheus. She took the time to walk me through the units and explained all the details pertaining to my decision and made the process effortless. Yesterday I had a mattress delivery and was rendered unavailable due to work obligations while out of town and I called Tea and she went above and beyond to help me accept the delivery while gone and she helped get the mattress inside my unit! I’m extremely excited to be here at Alderwood and it is primarily because of the great customer service and support. I know I can count on Tea and the team here at Alderwood which is priceless. Yes I’d recommend this apartment complex and it is worth every penny.< /review><resp>{'time': 1604626864149, 'text': "Hi Mo! Tea is so flattered by this review.

First, the neighborhood is friendly and welcoming. Second, the management team is always responsive and take care of/reply to our requests on time. Third, the talented service team is efficient to respond and fix the issues promptly.
Last but not the least,  the complex has beautiful grass landscaping and water fountain areas that attracts us when we need a place to relax and take a walk after a long day.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Great apartment complex, completely worth the steep price tag.  I lived here for 2.5 years, never had a problem that wasn't quickly resolved by the very reasonable and friendly management.  I've lived in roughly 10 different apartment complexes over the past ~ 15 years and this one was the most well run.  Great area, highly recommend!</Text>

<text>We moved into the Alderwood Apartment Complex last June (2019) for medical reasons. We hadn't lived in an apartment for over 45 years and were apprehensive about what to expect.
We have to say that the experience has been exceptionally pleasant because of the friendly, 'quick to help' and professionalism of the staff, Kimberly, Ashlyn, Melissa and the maintenance crew led by Cruz.
Everything about this move has been EXCEPTIONAL!!
The Alderwood Complex gets 5 stars!!!</text></record></dataset><record>

I had the chance to visit the complex during the week, and was worried I wouldn’t be able to see a place after visiting so many other places in the area that refused to show me around without an appointment. To my delight, the ladies in the office warmly greeted me and immediately made me feel welcomed. Unfortunately, they don’t have any apartments available yet, I will definitely be keeping my eyes open for when they do! It was so refreshing to visit a place where they genuinely cared about helping me find the right place to “call home!”<//review>

<Review>We have been living here for the past 8 months so I think now it's time to share a review of these apartments. First of all, this is a very quiet community; Very rarely you would hear loud noises (with the ocasional motorcycle here and there). Management is probably the best we have dealt with in a long time; Upon starting living on the unit we had a problem with our carpet and they promptly replaced it. Maintenance is definitely top notch; Mr Cruz has been nothing but amazing on repairing everything we had issues with, he's very knowledgeable and quick! I mean we came from a `new building` community before and maintenance had to go 2-3 times to repair something or they would take a long time; Here you get a quick response and they fix the issue.

Now for the downsides; I would say I only have 3 things that bother me and those aren't necessarily issues on the community or management but just things that happen:
1) If you have a unit facing Santa Lucia Drive, you will see a bunch of shady people parking there and sometimes teens smoking weed. There's a complex right in front of this one where a lot of smokers come from and they cross the street to smoke on this community side plus some people smoking weed, so you will definitely smell stuff sometimes in the night.
2) There are LOT of bugs, since this community is built around trees and lot of nature you will get your plenty share of mosquitoes, random bugs and of course spiders. I have never seen a crock-roach in my entire time living here which speaks that they keep bad pests under control; But I have definitely dealt with the biggest spiders i've seen in my life haha; I've probably identified 4-5 different species already of spiders.
3) Apartments are a bit dated and well this is a fact since they were built on 1980's but they have been renovated (still you will find some old stuff here and there).

Anyways; Overall my score would have been 4/5 but management and maintenance has been so good that I'm willing to bump it up to 5/5. I truly enjoy living here!</Review><userid>104336615985862798299< /userid><name>Carlos Castro</name></record>

<Review>I am not staying in Anderwood’s Apartments but stayed in one of the apartments for couple of nights. Surrounding near the Apartments is awesome, full of greenery. Its location is good as it is located very close to Central Park, a heaven for morning walkers.

Within the Apartments, it has got neat and clean swimming pool and health club. One may find fountains outside club entrance impressive. It is said that officers in its leasing office is helping as problems are sorted out quickly.

Ample parking slots adds value to Alderwood Apartments.<//Review>< Pictures>

Pros:
- Fantastic maintainence team and extremely helpful. Cruz had even helped me with jump starting my car when the battery died.
- great landscaping, always delightful to walk around the campus.
- great location with Central Park, library and tennis courts all accessible at walkable distances.

Cons:
- Rent is totally non negotiable. Though we stayed in the same apt for many years, we still pay the market price.
Be prepared for steep price hike the next year in case you did manage a deal price when you landed here.
Avoid apartments with a view and steel appliances since there is a premium associated with them and you will continue to pay for them for as long as you live there.<//Text>

With the new Apple campus opening up nearby, I feel as though I'm paying the premium that comes with demand for local housing for Apple employees. And the fitness center is really small, roughly the size of my single dorm room in college. They stuffed what they could in there, a few treadmills, a bike, an elliptical, a cable machine, and some dumbbells (25lb max), but it's not what I would consider well equipped.

That aside, I really enjoy this place. Here's a list of positive things I've experienced from living at Alderwood:
1. Prometheus management has the right corporate culture. It was intimidating going from knowing my landlord personally to having this large monolithic company to deal with, but in both Prometheus properties I've lived (and in the handful others I've visited/toured), the front desk staff are friendly, helpful, and understanding, going above and beyond to help me with whatever it is I need. Alderwood is no exception to this. They've even jumped my car when the battery died! And Prometheus makes moving between apartments/communities easy (I've already moved twice within their properties).
2. Cruz the maintenance guy has helped me multiple times, and is always clean, polite, responsive, and communicative, and always does quality work.
3. When a flaw in the apartment furnishing damaged some of my belongings, Promethus/Alderwood quickly offered to replace the items at no cost to me, and fixed the apartment furnishing without pulling from my security deposit. Again, company culture done right.
4. The grounds are well kept. Sidewalks are clean, grassy areas are watered and mowed, trees are trimmed, parking lot free of junk, etc.
5. The neighbors are friendly and generally quiet. Alderwood is full of young families so you get the occasional group of children playing outside, bikes and scooters, but overall things are serene. Not at all a college-type scene full of interns.

In all, I very much enjoy living here and would recommend it to anyone so long as the money works (and they don't mind exercising at work or getting a gym membership).</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1531939936030, 'text': 'Karl, thank you so much for taking time out of your day to share such great feedback.

This is the worst apt I have ever been lived. Their agent is basically trying to mislead you. Different time they give you different answers. And they never picked up your call. Such a horrible service. I'll never recommend any person living here.< /Review>

Haven’t been to sushi in a while noticed they had outdoor going the other day. Popped in this evening and couldn’t have been more delighted. The hostess was polite and emanated is inside immediately. Great menu with plenty of sake options as well. We had a ton of appetizers and they were all great. The special Salmon skin salad was noteworthy, very crispy and tender meat on a bed of spinach with a balsamic type sauce. Could have easily ordered another. The quality was exceptional. If you are looking for some great sushi this place is great.< /Text>

Phenomenal! One of the top 5 best meals I've eaten. Splurge to sit at the sushi bar.  Chef Billy taught me so much while I savored each bite. The service was impeccable, led by manager Jack. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.<//review>

Saru is one of the best sushi restaurants in SF. The $$$$ rating is wrong, I would say $$$. Not as expensive as many other places in the city.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>One of the best Omakase experiences we've had outside of Japan. They source most of the produce from around Japan and the preparation lets the flavors shine. The service is friendly and welcoming -- great experience.

We had the Omakase menu at chefs table and will definitely be back for the a la carte option as well. 👌< /text>< Pics>

<Text>This is my first time experience at a Michelin star restaurant and I really enjoyed it! I booked the reservation around a month earlier to make sure I can pick the date and time I want. They called me to confirm my reservation two days ahead of time and really made sure asking me if I have anything I don’t eat. The food is very fresh and the service is very great. The menu is fixed and actually was not as expensive as I thought (80 usd per person before tax and service fee) - 10 courses! The one thing I didn’t like was it is a little bit noisy when everyone is seated. It’s probably due to small space with a lot of tables very close to each other. Other than that, everything is great!< /Text>< Response>

Salmon skin salad- super delicious and a generous portion. Omakase sashimi selections were simply outstanding and beautifully presented. Rolls were snappy and full of flavor but that White Out roll...omg! Thx for the extra care put in to carry out packaging. Highly recommended!<//text>

I really enjoyed the experience here. The staff was extremely friendly and the sushi was fantastic. I've never liked every piece of nigiri were we served at a restaurant so much. We thought it was great value relative to the other top-end places in town. Don't be too snobby for the hot sake. It's good!<//Review>

Unique ingredients and great presentation of dishes. Warm, trendy atmosphere and great service. The wood at the bar is really nice to touch too, 500 grit sandpaper used periodically.< /Review>

<Review>Amazing set menu dinner! Each dish was very well done!

Highlights:
- Monkfish liver, which had a fois gras quality to it, soft, rich, buttery
- Akami (tuna) nigiri, dry aged for a few days and marinated in soy, resulting in a very concentrated, umami tuna flavor.
- Tamago, one of the best I’ve had, it had a different, softer texture due to the yam and shrimp in it
- Grilled yellowtail, excellent flavors all around</Review><Date>1548313005427<//Date>< Rating>

<Review>Sublime restaurant experience, from start to finish the flavors were delicate and expertly balanced, in finesse and savory throughout. The chef was welcoming and explaining everything, clearly wanting us to have a great time. The sake pairing was marvelous and on point (thanks Ike!). The service was attentive down to every detail. Will go again and recommend to anyone.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

This place is not owned by Japanese chef, but this place provides far superior experience than any Japanese place I know in San Francisco. Highly recommended<//Text>

<Review>We were very disappointed. We were excited with the previous reviews (before they were closed for almost a year). The food was tasteless. About 3 of the 12 courses offered were some kind of miso soup with no flavor to it. We got 6 pieces of sushi total. They were good but not enough for a sushi restaurant. We spent $400 for 2 with 2 drinks each. Overpriced! That’s not a high quality/experience restaurant. Go to Robin Sushi instead - they know how to impress you for the same (or less) investment!</Review>< time>

Bland and weird dishes. No balance in each dish and repetitive flavor is served again and again. Not worth the $100 dollar.</text>

<Review>This is not the place you want to go to do impress your hot date. $75 omakase lures in droves of tourists and young tech-money kids intent on getting in on a foody omakase place. This is not that place.

After the first course, the entire table was making eyes at the incredibly inexperienced service, strange decor and music, and general complete absence of understanding of the omakase tradition.

After the second course, multiple people at the table looked around and questioned the actual validity of the experience, with mutterings of “scam” permeating discussion.

This is NOT the same Kinjo that earned its Michelin Star. The food was BAD. Like NOT good. Like we left after the first sushi course because it was so bad...

Save yourself the time and money and go to a place where you find even a SINGLE Japanese person at a table...

I don’t write many reviews, and I have NEVER left a restaurant before the meal was completed.... but wow. I’m still in shock at how bad it was...<//Review>< user_name>

The fish was perfect - fresh, and not refrigerated. Preparation was awesome. Service was great. A fabulous meal. I especially liked the fatty tuba and the sea urchin.</Review>

<Text>This is a SCAM. There were red flags upon the moment we walked in, but we decided to stay in hopes that the meal would make up for it. It did not and we walked out halfway through the omakase. DO NOT BELIEVE THE MICHELIN STAR, it was awarded before the 7-month remodel. I am currently contacting the Michelin Guide to get this star removed and the restaurant re-reviewed.

The service staff were unprofessional, clumsy, and awkward. The kitchen was full of staff just standing there. The place was half empty.

The food was HORRENDOUS. Nothing tasted fresh, everything was bland and tasteless. The first two courses had ingredients that seemed to be sourced from Costco, with horrible quality octopus, shrimp, and vegetables. The sake was served in a wineglass at room temperature.

The first sushi course sealed the deal. The fish was doused in soy sauce, presumably to cover up the lack of flavor and freshness. Whatever flavor did cut through seemed comparable to an all you can eat sushi place. The restaurant tried to pass of fake wasabi as freshly ground wasabi root. The a la carte supplemental menu had outrageous prices for fish that was not sourced from Japan.

I have never left a restaurant halfway through dinner and have never been compelled to write a negative review. Regrettably, the restaurant did not live up to expectations what-so-ever.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Definitely have been to places, paid the same and no where as good.  added on a few items from their a la carte menu that you can't get anywhere in SF (ask your waiter).

Kinjo changed its menu after the renovation this year. They only offer the petite omakase dinner, compared to the full omakase menu before. The taste of the food was not as good as before. Most of the nigiri sushis are seasoned heavily with soy sauce and you cannot taste the flavor of the ingredient itself. The service of the manager (since he was the host at the door, and wear differently compared to our table waiter) was very uncaring and a little bit rude. And yes, I did not tip the full amount.

The noise level in the restaurant was unbearable, unbearable, unbearable. Our ears were raped by the noise from the table behind us for the entire evening. The table behind us was talking and laughing at an unreasonable level. The noise ended up causing me a headache, and I can feel my blood pressure raised.

I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone and I am never coming back again.< /text>

I wanted slightly more for the money, but it was good.

The most amazing thing I got was the O-Toro, but it wasn't part of the prix fixe. The way it works is, you make a reservation for the prix fixe meal. Before the desert part, they give you a menu and say, if you want anything additional, please order it now. And so you can get things that you had, or additional things. There's a good chance the main meal won't be enough food for you, and additions aren't cheap. The O-Toro was $28 for one piece of nigiri. Granted, they told me it's the same fish that Jiro gets in Japan, and it was legit. But it's easy to overspend and walk away not really feeling full.<//Review>

< review>
Went here for a conference. The venue was so interesting and rich with history. Francesca was so delightful and enthusiastic about sharing the history. Additionally she was so in tune with the conference participants and their needs, making special decaf coffee without having to ask. The staff was so friendly and helpful in a genuine way. Never have I been to a conference where the audio visual was so well taken care of. There were no glitches because the staff was capable and available so problems that arose didn’t become anymore than a momentary bump. I would highly recommend the venue as an excellent spot for conferences, or other events. It is clear that they are capable of creating an atmosphere that is just right. The vibe was just right, no need to even consider a plan B!<//review>

<Review>Such a warm, attentive staff catering to all our needs and exciting venue for our annual conference - accommodated our large group learning experiences, online live streaming of talks and presenter videos, and small group discussions! Francesca is wonderful and supportive of our event! And she did such a beautiful job restoring this space to a lovely venue. It’s really a charming and memorable experience location to always be remembered in association with our organization.< /Review>< userid>

Best Venue of ALL OF SAN FRANCISCO!
If you got an event that needs a venue or you are an entertainer. I highly recommend Broadway Studios Venue. A lot of great people from Dave Chappelle to Train have been on that stage. Also the staff there is 👌🏻 Special thanks to Francesca and Eric. They will make sure all your needs can be provided for a smooth show, what ever it is from a conference to a concert. They also record the events if you need a place to share to more audiences Live. So glad I was able to be there and find this place. Shout out to A'niche and the Hash Outliers as well!</text>

Quaint house with a whole bunch of fascinating history!

Loved being on the main stage upstairs, and fascinated by the many side rooms and nooks all over the place!<//review>

<user>107380739246383950558< /user><text>Recently attended a large party (300+) in the upstairs club with its high ceiling and raised stage.  It is a great venue for large groups and would seem a great place for conferences and corporate events.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Everyone at the party seemed to be having a great time.  The kitchen turned out a great array of light snacks.  There is a second, smaller club downstairs that can accommodate perhaps up to 200 people.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Broadway Studios is the place to bring your conference. This unique venue provides a theater setting with a built in stage, line array sound system, and great lighting. To top it off they provide in house catering at the food was great.< /Review>

<review>Attended a corporate Christmas party there...an awesome space, high ceilings, great sound, lots of space to dance, balcony for the watchers, 3 bars....what's not to love.  Was there until closing and never saw a lit iPhone in the room... I imagine people were having too good a time to record it.  Great party!</review>< Rating>

<Review>Great special event venue for conferences, Corporate events, Seminars, Live shows and many more. They got a great crew that can plan your event from the start to end. I have attended many conferences in Broadway Studios and could not be happier. Great foods, great A/V set up and great atmosphere.
Recommend this place to anybody who is looking for a venue for their event.<//Review>< user_id>

This place is the home of the former Mabuay Gardens AKA "The Mab" or "The Mab on Broadway". This spot has a special historical significance to many Punk Rock bands who played gigs here back in the 1980's.<//Text>

Pretty cool placs to hold an event. I'm not sure if it's a bar normally or not. It has a cool older feel to it. Has a small balcony/mezzanine thing.<//review>

It would be a nice venue if it wasn't constantly smoky the entire day. I had to buy eye drops to deal with the conference day. Also catering did not keep hot water or coffee filled for breaks etc  Also the hole in the roof was distracting.< /text>

(Translated by Google) An event conference venue near Chinatown in San Francisco. About 10 minutes by Uber from Union Square. This venue has been around since 1989 and is not too big and convenient. The bus stop is also in front of you. It can accommodate up to 700 people and is fully equipped with WiFi. I visited for the first time as a venue for the pitch contest, and the atmosphere surrounding the stage like an old movie theater was good. It also offers a catering service, and it seemed that it could be used at business meetings. A place you want to use if you have the opportunity.

(Original)
サンフランシスコの中華街の近くにあるイベント・カンファレンス会場。ユニオンスクエアからUberで10分程。こちらの会場は1989年からあり、大きすぎず便利。バス停も目の前にある。700名程まで収容でき、WiFi完備。ピッチコンテストの開催場所として今回初めて訪れたが、古い映画館のようなステージを囲む雰囲気が良かった。ケータリングサービスも行っており、ビジネスミーティング等でも利用できそうだった。また機会があれば利用したい場所。<//Text>

I remember how fun it was with that huge slide and long balance beam bridge in my childhood. Too bad it has succumbed to modern conformity.<//Review>

A great playground for children of pretty much all ages. The park has something for everyone, from a little but still fun rock climbing wall with spots of various difficulties, swings (for much very small children and normal swings), sand, structures, slides and more.</Review>

Lovely playground for kids. Climbing wall. But only has portable toilets. Not awful, but less than ideal</text>

<Review>The park is Clean of trash on the grounds. Its nice, there is a section for the older children and the Toddlers.
On the weekend, families are BBQing on the grills and having a family event at their tables .
Usually on the weekdays in the mornings you will see Nannies and children on the playgrounds. Its a safe area.
There is a school across the grass area also. Hope you all come out to enjoy the beautiful family friendly park soon. Thank you</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Free tours at 11am on saturdays and sundays. The store has fresh eggs and pasture raised meat. If you are a farm member you can walk around for free anytime or go catch and release fishing in the lake.<//Review>

< review>
A wonderful farm created from the awareness that farm animals deserve to live good lives, with dignity - in the open air, under the sun, eating healthy foods - before being slaughtered. Even as a vegetarian, I'm totally in alignment with this philosophy. They offer farm tours at noon on Saturdays and Sundays - a great experience for the kids, and for anyone who wants to know where meat comes from, and to see animals living good, signifies lives.</review>

I just visited this farm with my friend and we got to see goats, chickens and pigs! I also bought some items from their farm store - eggs, bacon and soap. I cooked some bacon last night and it is by far the best tasting bacon I've had in a long time! Thank Tara Firma Farms!< /review>

There was nobody in the office when we got there and we asked a staff member outside but he seemed like he didnt know what to tell us. He politely handed us what seemed to be a map but didnt really do much for us. wish they have been more specific and helpful as to where to go or which direction to take as we were just trying to do a self guided tour.</text></record>

<Text>This is my son's 2nd year attending Vilda Farm Camp at Tara Firma Farm and he absolutely LOVES it!  Its a great program with awesome camp leaders who obviously enjoy their job working with kids.  The kids are outdoors the whole day and kept engaged with fun, exciting activities and new adventures.< /Text>< Pictures>

About as down to earth as humanly possible. Owners/ employees are so nice, friendly,  and laid back.  Their products are also very high quality, grown/ raised responsibly and are delivered or sold still as fresh as the day they were harvested. Love this place!< /text>

Pasture Raised meats and local goods for sale or delivery! One of the few farms to offer guilded tours. Lots of cute animals and educational opportunities. Great for families, schools, or groups looking for a fun way to spend the weekend.<//Text>

Had a great tour. Learned all about their animals, sustainability and how they work with other farmers/ranchers in the area. They do public tours at 12pm on Saturday and Sunday. I highly recommend checking them out.</text>

Beautiful oak trees line the rolling hillside.  Last I was there there were no formal tours so call them if you're looking for something specific.</review>< Pics>

<review>Tara Firma is the place for grass fed animal protein and organic produce. You can buy at their store--or better yet, get a weekly order of goodies that you can pick up at various locations in Petaluma and other nearby towns. They've got a special way of drying/aging their grass-fed beef that gives it really good flavour.< /review>< rating>

Beautiful farm in every way. The animals live the way they deserve and are slaughtered under the watch of people who truly care about their wellbeing. I can't wait to go back for another visit.<//Review>

Fallas on Sunnymead I had a terrible experience with a cashier . Her name is Marie  very disrespectful. I asked, for the supervisor and Marie ran all over the supervisor,  I asked, too speak to  the manager , I couldn't believe it she continued to shake her head and point fingers in front of management. Wow who is really in chain of command? Rude, no customer service skills ( they say, & no it wasn't an African American) the manager gave me a regular phone number so I can make a complaint ( I laughed) but I went hire up and made a complaint on the cashier & management, also with letters following behind. Remember employees work with each other, Corporate doesn't have the same voicemail as a cell phone. It's really a shame. Fallas on Day Street, awesome store as well as employees.< /Text>

The place is always stuffy and warm  some employees are really good and some not so nice. Just got to watch the clothes though sometimes they run smaller and sometimes have small holes in them  too bad they are all going out of business<//review>

Well, I am frugal so yes this is up my alley but a lot of times I get home and does not come close to my visual imaginery since they have no fitting rooms.
And yes they have amazing deals on cheap made clothes.< /Text>

It's good for the bare basics, but not much else. The last two times I've been here they don't take card so it's a good idea to bring cash.< /text>

Great value for the prices, they have a high rotation of items. It's like they say "miss a weak, miss a deal"

Taste like Winchels Donuts if anyone remembers that shop as a child.  The people who run it are always very nice. Always friendly.< /review>

<Review>My favorite donut shop! These donuts actually taste like donuts. Lol. Seriously though. I’m my opinion, OTHER  shops have bland tasting donuts. BUT not this shop! Fresh and yummy every time. Also, I appreciate that they open at 4:30am (That’s dedication). I bring my 10 year old son here sometimes before school starts. It’s his favorite treat too. If you haven’t tried these donuts then stop in ASAP.  You won’t regret it. As a matter of fact, I’m at Donut Den just about to go in right after I post this for you. 😋</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>My favorite hideout for a quick pastry and coffee. I love the apple fritters and blueberry donuts. They also serve Chinese food dishes for lunch at a great price.  They usually have a newspaper out for you to read. My favorite part is seeing families come in, with wide-eyed kids, pointing out their favorite. What kid doesn't love a donut? This business is local, independent and family run. Super friendly. They're thriving in the shadow of Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts and I love supporting them while I get my donut fix.< /Review><user_id>103600944249427094473</user_id>< Name>

Exactly what a donut shop should be in my opinion: 1990s atmosphere, hearty donuts of all our favorite varieties well-made, also offering fresh breakfast options and Chinese food at lunch time.  I love it.</review>

<Review>The company I work for buys 3 dozen donuts for us three Friday's a month.  The people who work here are the best, so kind and helpful and (somehow) they are always in a good mood.  The donuts are great and I've had lunch there once and it was really good as well.  I've heard the pork buns are yummy, but haven't given them a try yet!<//Review>< Name>

Professional, Knowledgeable, Caring Experienced.
I was specifically looking for a PT place that provided Orthopedic manual therapy, and I am so glad that I found Mesa Physical Therapy. Aside from providing excellent care, their price also is very affordable compared to many other places. I highly recommend it. My PT Dr. was Dr. Mark who is very experienced. Great customer service and Practice.<//Text>

I seriously am so impressed with how much I have improved following the treatments I’ve received with Mesa Physical Therapy. My program started at the facility, and after every appointment, I noticed improvement. Since COVID-19, I’ve been doing virtual sessions. It’s easy to do, they can still assess if I am doing the exercises correctly. And again I continue to See improvement!

Their therapy program worked so well on my knee, that I asked my doctor if I could receive physical therapy for my back which has been an issue for years. She agreed, and I’m starting to see progress there as well. I had no idea that strength training plus stretching had so much to do with our physical well-being.

If you’re getting a referral for physical therapy, see if they have Mesa Physical Therapy in their options.< /Review>

This place is awesome. You can tell that everyone there cares about you and what they do. As a motorcycle mechanic I have struggled with pain the last 10 years and have gone to every doctor there is. This is the first place that I have been where I truly know that they care about my pain and helping me to feel better. I trust the team here and am so grateful I found them. I’ve seen real results since coming and will keep coming back. Jamie the receptionist has the most warm and welcoming attitude and smile, and will brighten up your day no matter how you're feeling. Randy and Kim are so personable and professional and i appreciate all their time and care. Thank you.</Review>

I was referred to Mesa after wrist surgery. I cant say enough positive things about the entire staff at the facility. The skill set and knowledge  of my therapist Jackie was highly impressive and the end result of my therapy proved this! Thanks all!<//review>

Experienced, kind, professional, and most important -- effective.  MPT has helped me and my son recover from injuries that required surgery.    When Mark told me that I was ready to "graduate" from  my four plus months of physical therapy, I was a little bit sad.  It was an amazing experience.  My recovery was tough, but Mark knew how to help me not only physically but also psychologically.  He motivated me to push through the pain, and  he was right every step of the way.  He has done the same with my son, who is soon ready to return to playing soccer after six plus months of physical therapy.  We are so delighted with his recovery.  Plus the office staff is great - always friendly and responsive, ready to help....especially Jaimie.   Thank you!</text>

I  have been receiving hand therapy for a work related injury.  My experience with Mesa PT has been a pleasant experience.  All of the service proviers are always so positive and friendly,  from the receptionist accomodating  appointments for my very busy schedule,  to the Therapist and assistants working together as a team.  They are very personable and charming, I highly recommend this facility. thank you for your gentle style and  patience.</text>

< review>
I had a very good experience with Mesa PT. I had an elbow injury and worked with the occupational therapists for two months. They were very flexible with scheduling which was awesome. After the diagnosis I wanted to start treatment ASAP. I called many different OT offices and no one could help me or see me for many weeks. Mesa got me in that same afternoon for my first session. Michelle, Jenna, and David did a great job guiding me back to health and provided wonderful emotional support during a stressful injury! Thank you, Mesa!</review>

<text>Mesa Phys Therapy is AWESOME! I went for an IT Band issue that was posing problems when I ran. The whole staff is friendly, and knowledgeable. I was always greeted with a smile (even when I wasn't in the best mood).

Mark was my PT and he was fantastic. He set me up with regular exercises to do at home. At the office he tried a few different treatments and when we hit on something that worked well, we kept at it. I was able to not only run the shorter distances that would begin to manifest the pain in my knee, but move beyond those distances and get into longer and longer runs.

The net result: my runs were more consistent, my speed increased, and the pain went away.

If I have another issue that needs to be dealt with through PT, I'll definitely use Mesa again.< /text>< Pics>

Turns out that my minor back injury was a good thing as I was referred to Mesa and now I am doing better than before. I did not understand how compromised my back muscles were from years of office work.  Randy put together a therapeutic and strengthening plan that has greatly diminished my pain and discomfort. The Mesa staff are all friendly, energetic and very supportive. Thanks!< /Text>

I had a shoulder surgery in december and my doctor suggested Mesa Physical Therapy for me. I did a bit of research beforehand, and decided to go with them.  After completing my therapy, I have to say, I couldn't be happier!  The entire team at Mesa Physical Therapy that I worked with (Randy, Jessica, Dang, Allison, etc) were exceedingly knowledgeable and friendly.  I actually looked forward to going to physical therapy. My doctor was extremely impressed with my results and I am extremely happy and grateful!<//Text>

<review>One of the worst places you can get watch repair. Service is appalling and completely unprofessional. We brought this watch for a battery replacement after purchasing the 2 year warranty for batteries , once we got the watch the face was crooked and had dents on the side. Returned to shop and employee stated the scratches were already there and never even apologized for the clear mishandling of my watch. They refused to refund the small fee of watch battery. Later they retracted and We’re  willing to perhaps refund if they took back the battery they had put in. All in all the watch which was older and a family heirloom was treated with pure disdain. What a shame! They had such a simple job and failed miserably. We took the watch to another watch repair man who confirmed the ill treatment of the broken piece inside and was able to repair it at our cost. “Fast fix “is the worst place to take your valuables! Do not trust this place.</review>< Pics>

This place is amazing. The older gentlemen managed to fix my broken metal frame from my glasses. He did an excellent job laser welding them and I couldn’t be happier! The guy is a life saver!<//Text>

These people scammed me. I took them my daughters broken chain necklace to be fixed. As soon as I got home, it fell apart before I was even able to put it on her neck. It broke in the same exact place, that he so called "fixed it"...Smh. Wasted my money. Now I have to take it to another place to be repaired correctly.<//Review>

< review>
The woman there by the name of AMANDA is extremely rude and unprofessional.  She needs to go back  to school and get a refresher course 101 on "how to be nice and treat customer with kindness".  Her demeanor, when I was inquiring on having my jewelry fixed and asking for discount, was extremely COLD and APATHETIC and UNACCEPTABLE!
.
She acted as if she OWNED the place and even if she did, she has NO RIGHT to act the way she acted towards me.

There is always a better way to say "no, we cannot extend the discount or it cannot be done".  Amanda?  Yes just told me flat out right that it cannot be done with an attitude.  Why is she there again working?  Her presence at the store is LIABILITY.  You want more customers?  Get a nicer and more friendly front liner.  She is driving business away.   I am NOT going back to this place again.

Even the Kevin Jewelers people, who happen to recommend the place, told me that I wasn't the only customer extremely displeased with her cocky and arrogant attitude.< /review>

<text>I primarily go to this place to get my watches fixed. (I.e. battery replacement, band adjustments or replacing watch bands)  But, know that this place offers more than just what the shop name implies.  They also sell watches and jewelry.

One reason that I am a repeat customer of this place is because of the reasonable prices for the services they offer.  So, if you are looking to get your watch fixed, I recommend you pay this place a visit.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80ea6a659fbb21ff:0x29edd7a29f18512a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>THIEF'S.  I took my watch in for an estimate for a pulled pin and got quoted 80.00 to fix the pin I pulled out (nothing was missing, pin & crown intact).  When I picked up my watch the pin and the crown were missing.  I was told that the pin was inside the watch and the charge would be to replace the missing crown (which was intact with the pin when I took the watch to them).  So they were going to charge me for my own crown.  Consumer be warned you might be getting duped.< /review><username>Irene Pickard<//username><Pics>None< /Pics>< Date>

Took my new engagement ring in to be sized it was 0.5 too small. They quoted me $60 to go up half a size. Then took off half a size, made me wait an hour before they would start to fix it. I asked about compensation for the mistake and Amanda insisted all they could do was 10% and was condescending. So she charged me extra for the half size they took off then gave me $6 off making it the same price it should have been $60. Now my band has ridges in it and is dull. I'll never go here again. Roco's on ming comes highly recommended! 3 hrs for a 45 min job and it was disappointing, I'll be going somewhere else to fix it< /text>

I had my watch done twice by this place both times, for same reason being my band snapping off and my spring flying out. Then I come to find out after couple months sitting on my shelf with the others I realize one side of the band is completely on backwards and with having no knowledge of working a watch band or having the tools, I could tell this by the simple arrows on the backside and with my madre being a past jewelr she said "first problem is band is inncorect" of the band where they put it on backwards. Also when I went there for second time to get done for there own mistake I still payed again and still was wrong.</Text>

<Text>This is one of my favorite spots to eat in Hermosa Beach. I used to live less than a block away and would come here daily 10 years ago. My mom and I had an awesome lunch for mothers day. We had a gorgeous waitress too! I was super happy with the entire meal over all and can't wait to come back. Thanks to the good people who run Scottys as I will be a life long customer.
To anyone second guessing they have great pricing and their dinners are super good as well. Just can't really go wrong here...you have an ocean view and there is handicapped parking. Love this spot!!< /Text>< Pictures>

Great breakfast! Had the Scotty's Special Omelette, always so good! Sat outside on the beach side which was lovely. GREAT teamwork by the serving staff - everyone pitched in, checking on each others' customers! Haven't been in 1.5 years, so good to be back for the best breakfast around.</review>

This place never changes. Which is good. Big menu. Good service. Make the beer a little colder and it's 5 stars. Beautiful location to see the view and the people</Text>

<Text>It's good. I feel like Scotty's is overhyped a little because it's a local institution that nearby residents love. The food is nice, nothing too special. The staff was a bit cold. But you can't beat the view.
All in all, good enough food for the price, but I wouldn't really go out of my way to come here again.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>I had to order water 3 times before I received it, and at that it never showed up until after I had finished my meal. My fiance was given the wrong beer, I was given the wrong entree. When we ordered my fiance another beer, the server gave us an attitude, because he previously had been at the table but not waited longer than 10 seconds for my fiance to be finished chewing and answer him.

I understand being busy,  and if it was just having to sit and wait for water, I wouldn't mind, but this was just bad service.<//Review>< date>

< Review>
Scotty's On the Strand,1100 Strand Hermosa Beach, CA location: The Older lady was rude. I offered the menu that I had briefly looked at from off the podium to a couple who came up, and the older woman working there acted like it was contaminated and gave them a different one. They were all of Mexican or Latino descent while I am Black. It seemed discriminative. Also she failed to mention that the batter for the fish has beer in it, I don't drink beer and the food made me nauseous till I had to throw most of the fish out.  The soup was the creepiest slop I've ever seen with a slice of soggy bread broken up in it, I completely threw all that out plus the younger female Waiter, Jasmine, never gave me a spoon. They clearly don't want my repeat business and they definitely won't get it. The food was cheap quality, like they use really poor grade of ingredients. I'd pass on it if I were you.< /Review>

<text>Amazing little spot steps away from the Sand and Surf.  Will surely return.
1st timer, but recommend the Chicken Enchilada Omelette, as well as the pork chops.  The pancakes are awesome, but the booths do kinda suck.  When someone sits behind you in a booth, you know it!!<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Good, affordable food, right on the beach. Very cozy vibe. I like the booths. If you’re looking for an affordable family friendly option with good servers this is an excellent choice. The only reason for 4 stars, rather than 5 is the decor (inside and outside) seems to be from 1982. Throw a fresh coat of paint on this place and it would be awesome. That being said, I love the Blackened Chicken Sandwich (or the Surfin Bird sandwich), it is delicious. They also serve breakfast all day and have daily specials, including an all you can eat spaghetti day. Definitely a worthwhile restaurant choice, not fancy, but friendly, affordable, and tasty.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Scotty’s is a classic, and a landmark of the Hermosa Beach strand.

My family stays at the Sea Sprite Motel right next-door, and this place has been a favorite of ours for years.   The staff is always friendly, the food is pretty basic - but good. They are slammed during summer months, but my favorite time to come is in the wee hours of the morning for endless hot coffee, good hot breakfast, and just staring out at the beach.

Today I’m here on a business trip and I brought my computer with me.  It’s the beginning of December so the beach goers today are presumably all locals - and the people watching is pretty amazing.

I highly recommend for a cozy and consistently good, diner-on-the-strand experience!<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAhPvBBCvJyR0y48FloVxXjLLnoolz40vtqLW4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrcYTcavP4iV6QPMm8TW1ubTokhnFVkucgyeSt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFH4eBSX5Zewyqo9FX5N1z8ECstKjRh0kx1be8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb31y82om4EbdqZ_D7CBIzXxmPp66Cfc2zE1_t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOR-GejVlsZVOjErZ_78bH7Xy5RWA9NKq1KRii1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I've and coming here for about 30 years. Is it the best place in town No. I go here a few times a month because I love being able to sit in front of an open window, ocean view, sea air blowing on me while I eat whatever the heck I can think of, while I watch people walk, bike and skate up and down the strand. I recommend my favorites, the pancakes and the spaghetti.<//Review><user_id>105302086422962333674< /user_id><Time>1572819750181<//Time><response>None</response>< name>

<Text>On the weekends I've walked or rode my bike past Scotty's for years and finally decided to stop by. They have parking in rear for customers. They have tables on one side and booths in the opposite side of the restaurant.  Ocean views. Fast service and friendly staff. Normal American restaurant menu I had a club with fries and sat next to the window.<//Text>< resp>

Love Scotty's!  An old beach favorite right on the strand in Hermosa Beach.  Super service this morning, had a great breakfast and they let me substitute potatoes for fruit! Yea!  What a view out the windows.  Great place after your morning walk on the strand.  👍👍<//Review>

<Text>This is such an amazing place to go eat. The scenery is amazing, the breeze was great.. the food was delicious. I ordered the seafood pasta and it was made to perfection.

I also ordered a chardonnay and that was great also. I didnt want to leave. This spot is easily on my top 10 places to go for a spectacular breakfast lunch or dinner.

The environment was perfect, the atmosphere was so comfortable. I enjoyed my visit here absolutely.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Question?... Do you like Fried Clams?
I do... and "yes" golden brown and delicious! How about with some tartar sauce, lemon, ketchup and a little salt. Well... that's how I like mine. So, go to *Scotty's On The Strand* and get some for yourself. You'll be glad you did.< /text>

This place is right up against the beach bike path. It is just plain awesome. The food is not spectacular but definitely good. I recommend going for breakfast or lunch.</Text>

This place is actually one of my new favorite places for a brunch. Nice location by the beach and those tables by the window facing the beach are heaven. I've been to this place twice since i found it through Yelp.
First experience (May 6) was amazing, my partner and i had marinated tri-tip with 2 eggs, potatoes and bread plus coffee and OJ. Our server was Candis and she was pretty nice and attentive
Second experience (May 21), we ordered exactly the same and it was great as usual but we were really disappointed with the service. Our server was Rachel, she didn't even say hi...grumpy when she took the order, MIA & the worst part was she dropped the check while my partner was still eating without even asking us first if we wanted anything else. We were thinking to order a bottle sparkling wine. My partner was mad because of this so we just paid the bill and moved to Hennessey's Tavern to have some drink.

Updated September 17, 2017:
Today I had brunch here with my partner, we both ordered the same food again and again everytime we eat here. It was 2 over medium eggs with medium rare tri tip, home fries, sourdough toast, coffee and OJ. Our server was Jessy and she was so attentive and friendly. We really had a good time enjoying our brunch facing the beach plus good service from Jessy. Well for that reason Scotty's deserves to get more stars :)

PS: This place provides private parking space for customers.</text>

<Text>I stopped by first time here...not bad. I stayed at the hotel next door years ago, funny I never saw this place. For a quick bite it was delicious. I very MUCH like the view, the breeze and just the me time. I'll be back, I don't know when? But hopefully soon...thanks guys.</Text>< rating>

Service was good and the Eggs Benedict delicious.  I didn't care for the coffee mug. Seemed to take away from the taste. Also the handicap bathroom was NOT acceptable for a wheelchair!<//review>

Scotty's is a wonderful place to go for a great meal breakfast, lunch or dinner or just for drinks and appetizers. The owner and staff treat you like friends and we go there when we can, and recommend it to everybody.< /text>

The food and service is excellent here. Back in the 1960's and 1970's when Hippies were around Hermosa Beach,CA, this was Taco Bell. But actually think now that Scotty's took over the food is better! Excellent selection on the menu also, and good view of the Pacific Ocean. Plus Wheelchair friendly, since I am a T-10 Complete Paraplegic.Highly recommend eating here!<//Review>

Fast service, good food, free parking, nice view and all you can eat homemade style spaghetti at a great price on Mondays. I've eaten most of the food they offer which ranges from Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.
Love the Pasta, Pizza, Grilled Sandwiches, Fish and Chips and Fried Chicken BBQ Salad. Great for people watching as they walk, run, bike buy. Has a beach and strand view. The staff is very nice. Big tables so someone could show up with 12 people and most likely get right in.  That pretty much sums it up<//text>

< Review>
Fantastic and interesting place on the beach, been here a couple of times. Their breakfasts are very very good, especially the Homestyle potatoes and omelettes, the muffins are really good too, last time I was there they had muffins that were made with marmalade inside, which I found to be unusual but tasty. I think the menu said breakfast is available until 3 p.m. The dining areas are set-up up kind of weird since you enter from the center of the building and one side is tables and chairs on the other side is booths I kind of think the at some point there was two separate buildings and somehow they connected them together. The view of the beach from the restaurant is pretty great though, especially in the table and chairs area. There is also apparently a banquet area above the booth side of the building that you can ask about if you need one.</Review>

Can’t believe this place is even open and it’s on the beach. Can’t understand why people aren’t checked this place. Food tastes describes as the worst food I’ve ever had. Food cost is high. Too expensive for crappie food, that’s not worth eating.<//Text>

Great people watching on the beach strand! Big yummy breakfasts, good sandwiches and hearty dinners. Watch the walkers, bikers, dogs, surfers, volleyball players and tourists from your table! Ride the 28 mile bike path!!!<//Review>

< Review>
A local's favorite diner type restaurant virtually on the sand. I've patronized this local gem for breakfast/ lunch for years. Nothing fancy. Food is freshly prepared, made to order and the servers are friendly.  A favorite is the breakfast quesadilla... ask for extra Spanish sauce.

The patio portion has skylights and virtually floor to ceiling windows that slide open allowing in the ocean breeze & sounds of the beach & strand. The view is directly, eye-level with the strand & sand allowing diners to watch the passers go by and volleyball players practice on the courts toward the south of the restaurant. (The view is better when the County doesn't have a giant storm-protective sand berm sitting between the restaurant & the ocean. Also, I recall when the section of beach directly out the windows & immediately south of the pier didn't contain the public restrooms & showers and wasn't utilized as an equipment & service vehicle parking area.) The view was nicer when it used to be just sand, volleyball courts, beach goers & the Pacific.</Review>

This place is closing soon due to a landlord changing their mind I guess. The best food it had was breakfast fare, the rest was so-so. The decor was always somewhat limited, probably due to the landlord issue. The location is literally on the beach, next to the runner and biking path that separates the beach from the rest of the land.</Text>

One of the worst breakfast experiences ever. I got there early as one of the first few people in the restaurant. I waited for my family to get done with Sunrise service on the beach for about 5 mins.  Sitting there waiting for the rest of my party to arrive, no one greeted us or even gave us menus. 15 mins after my party arrived, i finally went to the host stand to get menus and ask who our waitress was. When she was pointed out by another employee, i saw that Mariana, who had passed by me at least 10 times,  decided that she was going to ignore our table and take the orders of five Other groups that came in after us. It took her 20 mins to even acknowledge us...the other waitstaff got us drinks, and 45 mins after that to get some of our food. Mariana kept blaming the Kitchen, but funny to see all the other tables getting their food just fine. After an hour of no food, Mariana kept blaming the kitchen about being backed up and we had to ask the manager twice where our food was. When our food came out, we were missing 4 meals and she had No Clue what we even orders.
"Can't you see how many tables I have, i can't remember everything you ordered", she said.

Wow......just wow. I guess the pen and paper in your hand is just for decorations.

Pouched eggs were solid and the rubbery blueberry pancakes were actually blue...and with 2 small blueberries in each. The last bit of food finally came out 80 mins after we got there.."it's the kitchens fault."

We got a 10% discount for this ridiculously overpriced $100.00 breakfast.

At the end of the day, no one came over to apologize, Mariana never took ownership of anything she did, including not getting our order right. The manager wasn't around or wasn't managing if they were there.

Little bit of business 101... If you can't prepare to handle the rush of a Holiday, and staff your restaurant with the right amount of competent employees....maybe you should find better people to manage your store.< /Review>

There is a whole in the wall leading to the back parking lot.  No screen or anything- a rat or a anything could get in or out.  Menus need to be cleaned up.  Coloring boxes need to be cleaned up too...  Some fries were burnt and had an old oil flavor...<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The food is very rich and the coffee is delicious, a recommended place to eat, the only detail is that the people who serve there are a bit distracted

(Translated by Google) Nice View. (Feeling the sea)
Good food & staff.
Rustic and very good !! :)

With a seat with a sofa and a simple four-seat seat
Since it is divided into left and right, let's choose according to your preference.
