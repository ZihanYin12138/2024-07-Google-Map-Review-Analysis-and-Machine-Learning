< Review>
I used this service from my home in Orange County to LAX and then again back from LAX upon my return.  On both trips they were on time, the car was clean and the communication was excellent.  It took me a LONG time to get out of the airport after my flight landed and the driver waited patiently with no issues.  I would use them again without a doubt.< /Review>

I asked the driver to stop. I didn’t know you had to schedule all stops ahead of time. He got an attitude. To top it off, he said there’s no water bottles because things don’t revolve around me because it’s Covid. Extremely unprofessional. Also he played his music the whole time and the car was hot. I should have taken an Uber.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>After my regular car service closed, I found Executive Car Service. My communications are with Robert who has an amazing customer service. I wish every service I dealt with had Robert's professional service with perfection. I have never felt like I am just another customer. Robert has made me feel as though I am a VIP customer. If you do not believe me, try Executive Car Service!

Reliability: I do not need to call and make sure I am getting to my destination timely. The driver calls me as he is on his way to pick me up.

Cost: I am paying a lot less than with with my prior car service.

All I can say is I do not write reviews unless it is really exceptional and needs to be acknowledged.

THANK YOU EXECUTIVE CAR SERVICE.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdcea990b7161:0xe6425f99c0062c0a</Gmap_id></record>

<text>Great customer service, they always answered the phone and were happy to help with any question I had. Went to DisneyLand in a group and decided to get a stretch limo to accommodate 7 of us From LAX to Anaheim, and we couldn’t be happier it was with these guys. Our driver Justin was friendly and nice, car was clean and smelled good. Thank you guys for the great trip.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I wish I'd known about this company months ago. We just used Executive Car Service for a family vacation flying out and back from LAX. After days of worrying about Uber/Lyft/LAXit or self parking, I stumbled across this company. They are the only way to go. Professional, polite, and competitively priced. Excellent experience with which to start and end our trip.</text><time>1582610196194< /time><Rate>5</Rate>< resp>

<review>The service was really good from our home to LAX. The driver really understood where to go through the freeways and traffic in a good short amount of time.

Superb communications and quick responses when booking and also before pick-up. Very reliable, prompt, courteous, professional, and safe service!

I would highly recommend Executive Car Service LAX.  My drivers Robert (Laguna Beach to John Wayne) and Mylene (LAX to Laguna Beach) were so amazing and so nice.  The cars (BMW X5) were very comfortable, clean and had bottled water for me. Communication was on spot. I was so pleased with our service, I will be using for all my airport transportation. It took the stress and hassle out of dealing with Uber after arriving on an international flight at LAX and going back to OC during Souther Californa rush hour. The peace of mind was worth it!! Thank you again for superb and friendly service. I've already booked my next two trips.<//Text>

We recently used Executive Car Service from Carlsbad to LAX.  It definitely started our vacation off on the right foot. The car arrived on time, was immaculate, and our driver, Mylene, was a delight. Not only did she get us there safe and sound, but she was an excellent driver as well — and I am not a good passenger!  To our delight, Mylene, picked us up a week later for our return trip to Carlsbad ... at 5:15am it was nice to see a friendly face.  We would definitely recommend Executive Car Service and look forward to booking with them again!</review>

Where do i begin? From the reservation quote, the customer service, the vehicle presentation, and the driver.....everything was amazing! Our driver Meesh (hope i spelled it right) was wonderful and polite. The ride was from Lax ti Bakersfield and they were able to accommodate us at a very reasonable price and we had only booked it a few hours before landing. Definitely will use again!!!! You wont regret using their services!< /text>

Unexplained delay to airport pickup, with no contact from driver until 20 minutes after pick up time. Caused us to be 25 minutes late to a business meeting. Might as well have hailed an uber or lyft.

Edit: After bringing up issue to management the company did issue us a full refund for the trip. Management said that they are implementing new protocol to avoid such issues happening. Hopefully the professionalism of the office staff and management can be consistent through to the drivers in the future.</text>

We used Executive Car Service to pick us up in Costa Mesa and take us to LAX.  We also used them when we returned.  I was very impressed by the cleanliness of both vehicles, and it was apparent that the drivers enjoyed what they did.

Our first driver Mark was right on time, and got us to LAX very comfortably and was very pleasant.

Our return driver was Mylene who was also very pleasant and professional.  She was also right there when we got our luggage, so there was not any waiting around for her to show up.  We had a great ride and conversation back to Costa Mesa, and I would definitely request Mylene again to be our driver, and wish we could give her more than 5 stars!

This was the first time we have used Executive Car Service, and will definitely use them again in the future.  I particularly like that you are able to pay at the time of your trip, and to tip as you wish, without any fees being added upfront.< /Text>

<Text>Use them if YOU WANT to MISS YOUR FLIGHT.

We received couple of reservation confirmation emails on May.14 from Executive Car Service (E.C.S.) for a R/T transportation between Malibu-LAX, starting on Jun.10. 12PM.

On Jun.8, I called the E.C.S. to confirm the reservation; we received a following confirmation email that the company designated a driver for the Jun.10 12pm pickup.

Our experience with other Car Service companies have been that the company made a phone call few hours before our trip followed by a confirmation call by their driver on their way to our house with an estimated approaching time, NOT this company.

Not hearing from them, at 11:50AM, I called the company, was informed that the designated driver's car was broken (without informing us); a substitute driver was on its way, about 40minutes away!
We rejected their service; tried to find a local Taxi, none available at the time, so we jumped in our car and rushed to the LAX; eventually found a parking lot with a free spot (these days, parking lots require a reservation).

Driving to LAX was very stressful because of the time strain; we would had missed our River Cruise boat if missed the flight, consequently a costly trip to reach the boat.  Thanks to the flight delay, we made it, 3 weeks parking at LAX was $385.

This is a very irresponsible company; they care less that they can cause the customer a financial or other type of harms.
AVOID THEM; they are not worth your time or your money.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1571720222643, 'text': 'Hi Allan, first and foremost, let me apologize for what happened.

Great service!  Our driver, Mo, was waiting for us when we embarked from our cruise ship in San Pedro.  He was helpful with our luggage and was very friendly.  Our ride to LAX was quick and there wasn't any traffic because this was a Sunday morning.  I can't praise this company and the driver enough for a great experience and reasonable pricing.< /Review>

I had the absolute best service today from my ride from Anaheim to LAX.  My driver Robert was extremely professional, courteous and took pride in his service.  He was 15 minutes early called me to let me know and we were off and running.  He was pleasant and we had a great conversation all the way to the airport.  I would recommend him and the service highly and will be using them again in the very near future.

Thank you Robert for your exceptional and professional service today.  Thank you for having an immaculate vehicle and for your friendly service.

I hope to see you again in the near future.

First time using Executive Car Service. Sign up was straight forward and quick.  Rates are very competitive and actually cheaper than Uber in a much nicer vehicle.  Pick up was exactly on time. And my driver Mo was very personal and friendly. No issues and for sure will use again.< /text>

Mo was very professional and helpful with a real BIG bonus... left my cell in the back seat and didn't realize until I was checking in at my hotel.  Didn't have long to panic cuz he came back to give it to me before I could even figure out how to find him! Nicely done Mo!</review>

< Review>
The 1st driver bailed and left with any notice. The replacement driver arrived but I wanted an additional hour at the curb at lax. Also the last ride the driver said if I submitted a review I would get a $10 off on the next ride. When we got to my home the new driver had no record of this.

As a post script not only did they give me the discount but also refunded some money due to the additional wait time. Therefore updating the review. Thanks guys</Review>

Recently used them to take us to LAX, then from LAX to home. Ironically Nish was our driver and an EXCELLENT one! He was helpful, courteous and kind. On our return from an international flight, there he was, spot on, and on time looking for us in luggage claim.  This is BY FAR the BEST car service and service by Nish we have ever had. We will request him by name the next time we use this EXCELLENT car service. Worth every penny for their excellent customer service! Thank you Nish, you were AWESOME!!!<//text>

<Text>I don’t trust anyone with my eyebrows but after reading all these good reviews I decided to give it a try and I was not disappointed at all! She did such a great job shaping them , she left them thick like I asked her to and I felt no pain at all. I will definitely be back next month!

Puja is beyond professional with a beautiful heart and soul to match. Today was my first visit and I felt like she was an aunty. So caring and gave me great tips on how to grow back my eyebrows after tweezing them pencil thin in the 90’s. She is quick from experience and pays great attention to detail. Don’t be shied away that she works from home as I did at first. It’s actually comforting knowing that she cares so much for her craft that she invites new clients to her home salon. She is compliant with CDC and LA County regulations due to COVID-19 so please wear a mask.
Client forever!</Text>

<Text>Safe to say, I think this was the best eyebrow threading I’ve had. If not top 2 for sure. I loved the clean shape she gave to my brows. She listened to my request. Also the fact that it was a lot less painful compared to other people I’ve gone to, was a plus. Overall she was very pleasant and welcoming and had a very nice aura to her. I will definitely be going back for services! I went to her about 3 weeks ago :)< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>My experience is one of those that sticks in your head as you just appreciate how Puja’s ‘cutey-patuety’ self welcomes you right off, makes you feel comfortable and at ease conversing with you and checking on you; knowing how threading your eyebrows can feel, Puja had a gentleness about it that makes gettin it done even more dealable. She is so sweet she makes my teeth hurt. All in all Puja has me as a new client; truly glad I checked around and took a chance and finally lucked up on someone I looked to get my brows done by for a long time…<//review>< Rating>

<Text>My eyebrows look absolutely AMAZING after getting them done with Puja!! She does do the eyebrow threading at her house which may be intimidating to some people but she is so inviting, kind, and professional! She took her time while doing my eyebrows and made sure I loved them before I left. I will definitely continue to get my eyebrows done with her!!< /Text>< name>

<review>Me and my 3 daughters went for eyebrow threading they are hairy little monster... lol 14,14,13. My girls walked out still looking like young ladies within their age. Puja took care a few other problem areas that aren't normal to have at their age she was soft and spoke nothing but positivity unto them. I appreciate that. They were comfortable and happy with the service. My eyebrows have never looked better. We will be back. The best part is SHE is WALKING distance. Fyi comfortable environment and clean. You will be outside on her shaded patio.</review>< pics>

Puja is so kind! She is extremely welcoming and makes sure you are comfortable and happy at all times. Today was my first time trying threading as opposed to waxing and I could not be happier with the results. She shaped my eyebrows perfectly for my face and eyeglasses, which a lot of other people don't consider. The ambiance is nice and it smells lovely inside. She has great prices and even offers a stamp card deal. I will definitely be back when I need my eyebrows done as she was able to bring my face to life after I was unkempt due to being sick for two weeks. Lovely!

The salon is located on the left side of the garage, for all newcomers.</text>

I stopped by today around 6:45pm and there was no one inside the store  so I ordered two plates to go; I told the girl what I wanted she put the order in. I waited for like 20 minutes while it seemed like they were absolutely slow. I saw one of the women packing and checking the order as she was putting the containers in a bag so I don’t know if the ticket did not specify what was supposed to be on the plate. I was given my food, so I drove home and when I came home I opened the boxes so i realized it was not what I ordered and the sides were not what I order. It is a shame that the pandemic disrupted so many businesses and a lot of them have closedown permanently. The ones still open can’t even get a simple order right specially when the restaurant is completely empty and have no business at all; if the kitchen messed up my order, then the woman that checked my order to hand it to me should have realized it was wrong. Maybe, the person who took my order didn’t understand what I wanted but I don’t think that’s the case because she understood what I asked for and confirmed the order to me. Long story short, I won’t be spending my money here anymore. Just please have your stuff pay more attention in what they are serving. 😡😡</Text>

I've ordered take out 2 times over the last month and have received stellar service both times. The young lady who has taken my order both times is very pleasant and always smiles and makes you feel welcomed. Waiting for my food also allowed me to observe the crew and everyone seems to work as a team! The food is delicious and found a new favorite with the Fire Island Chicken. The restaurant is clean and the service is great!</review>

Get the BBQ chicken. Or the Katsu chicken. Or the Teriyaki chicken. All delicious. All very reasonably priced for the portions served. The restaurant has also done a great job keeping things clean and safe during the Corona times.< /Text>

In A Nutshell:

-Ono Hawaiian BBQ is a very nice Hawaiian restaurant located close to downtown San Jose off Monterey Highway.
-It's very clean inside & they've plexi-glassed the cash register area due to new restaurant requirement re:  COVID19.
-The menu is simple, not too many complicated choices.
-The Hawaiian BBQ Plate and the Teriyaki Chicken Plate are items I've ordered.
-If you check your mail, you should look for their coupons b/c you can save some money w/ their various "free" offerings.

Overall, the food is very tasty & you get a good amount of protein, very good prices!<//Review>

Really, really delicious Hawaiian food with solid plate sizes, friendly customer service, and inexpensive prices. They have a deal going on right now if you buy a $30 gift card (for use the next day), you get a $10 rewards card (for use late june-august). They have a few locations throughout the south Bay. We’ve been to this one twice (not any of the others yet) on the way back from hiking. Would recommend the well breaded but very tender katsu, teriyaki or barbecue chicken combo plates (make sure you ask for extra teriyaki sauce)! A friend recommended this place and we weren’t disappointed!<//review>

Reasonably priced,  portions are generous and best of all I was able to substitute the rice and macaroni salad with more steamed veggies and vegetable/coleslaw salad with edamame. I had the mahi mahi and crispy shrimp. Will eat there again.< /Text>

Ono is clean and spotless. They wipe down their tables and chairs. The food is way better than other Hawaiian BBQ spots in town. They always get my order right. They have a variety in menu selections such as their bomb fried shrimp... and they offer to sub out carbs for a fresh green salad. Btw, Their macaroni salad is better than other places. It is not basic and bland. Staff is always so friendly, helpful and nice. I'm so glad we got one in SJ and I dont have to drive to Morgan Hill for my Ono fix. They have a clean condiments station and are definitely not stingy with giving out katsu and teriyaki sauce. Plenty of parking.</text>

Or "are you ready to order " after staring at the menu for 2-3mins. But clearly was not going to happen. Good is treat thoe.< /review>< pics>

One of the better Hawaiian BBQ places, Ono serves fresh and not greasy. I tried the seafood platter which includes fried fish fillet, fried jumbo shrimp and (oddly) chicken teriyaki. These platters are served with 2 scoops of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. I always ask for the reverse, 2 scoops macaroni salad, and one scoop rice. The fish is thick and flakey with a crispy panko style crust, the 3 fried shrimp are large and NOT overcooked (thank goodness) and the chicken was tender and still juicy and flavorful. Maccoroni salad...yum.<//review>

I LOVE Hawaiian food. That said, this was a disappointment. Let's start with the good. The staff was friendly if a bit distracted. The place is clean. You get a good amount of meat for the money.

Now the rest. My wife ordered the kalua pork and BBQ chicken plate. I ordered the chicken katsu and mixed BBQ plate. The kalua pork was overly salty and tasted like it was salted after cooking. The BBQ chicken was just OK. The BBQ beef was greasy. The katsu was OK but dry. The katsu sauce was overly sweet. The cabbage under the meat was also greasy. We left halfway through eating. If it wasn't already served in to go containers, I would not have waited to take it home for my dogs. I won't be returning.< /review>

<Review>Jenny's laundromat seem to take care of their equipment. Washers cleaned well and spin cycle left no excess water in laundry. Dryers performed 50% better than another local place I've used recently; the cost was approximately 20% higher but worth it because I finished in less time. I gave it  4 rating because it really needed sweeping and trash cans were over-flowing.<//Review>< Resp>

A little over a year ago I used to frequent this laundromat... when my machine broke again, Jenny’s Laundromat was my first choice to come and wash my clothes at! I was stoked to arrive here and see that their machines accepted debit cards! My joy was quickly over run with filth. Random large spill on the floor, trash everywhere, and when I went to load my soap into the machine it was encrusted with LOTS of other soap. Kinda gross? Definitely not the place it used to be. Only two tables to fold at and not nearly enough seating.<//review>

Best laundromat around, clean, well lit and in good repair. Rarely are there out of order machines, gets busy sometimes be prepared to wait a few min if you want a specific machine. All machines are LARGE LOAD and range from 2x to 7x loads so make sure you brought all your laundry, no small loads. All machines are equipped with card readers as well as coin slot, change is available from a machine on site.<//Text>

This business shouldn't be allowed to open its doors! This place needs to be reported to the city! The ceiling is falling, only 3 dryers work, water all over the floor, no place to fold your clothes... The absolute worst, dirtiest, and just the most disgusting place to do your laundry. I would NEVER RECOMMENDED THIS LAUNDRY MAT.... EVER!<//text>

<Text>When I came to yucaipa this is the first laundromat we went to when we moved here let me tell you that although they made a lot of improvements that made the place look better now especially the fact that I can use my debit card to wash my clothes and dry without having to go to the atm machine or pay any fee for it either so WE LOVE IT HERE THE MACHINES ARE GREAT WASH IS A BREEZE BUT the dryers is the thing I wish I wouldn't waste my quarters on the ones that hardly warm up or heat up makes no sense I don't know but all landromats have these types of machines that don't usually dry or heat up as much so it makes you upset and waste of money this irritates me a bit although over time you wash there then you get to know which ones are the dryers that best heat up so you get your money worth and don't waste your time.</Text>< user_name>

< Review>
Came in with my wife to do laundry and we usually spend about $25-$30 in laundry every two weeks. Well considering that this is a newer establishment we figured that the machines would be faster , quicker, and better. Well they are not. We used their big load washers that were $6.75 a load, they didn't wash the clothes very good so we redid the clothes in two of those twice! My wifes whites are not exactly white anymore. We saw other customers having to rewash their clothing twice as well. And the dryers... Well one quarter, 25 cents, only gives you 6 minutes of drying time and some dryers only give you 4 minutes. Their medium heat selection might as well be the no heat selection. No lie. Our budget of $25-$30 to do laundry turned into $60! They dont wash right and they dont dry at all. And no we didn't over stuff the washers.. In case anyone was wondering. And All brand laundry detergent is a good quality detergent so it wasnt the soap. Im going back to Yucaipa Coin Laundry on the circle of Yucaipa Blvd and 2nd St. Its not new but their machines are always serviced and wash good. And 50 cents gets my clothes dry. Todays economy, you got to save every little penny that you can. And I honestly do not feel like over paying for horrible service just to make sure that somebody else covers their bill to keep their business running.< /Review>

We did the special Hamburger Month special with a WAGYU burger - EXCELLENT QUALITY AND COOKED to perfection for $10 and almost double if you had a soft drink and "extra" such as grilled onions.
Could not ask the source because although the Hotel attendant picks up the phone immediately, there is no way to talk to the kitchen.
We chose PICK-UP and it was a nightmare if you did not have APPLE PAY, which we did not and so ordered on the computer.  We ordered at 3 PM, first slot open; were told "around 4:17PM" and got the order at 4:40 after waiting at the curb.   The guy who brought the food out was super unfriendly.  The fries were cold and hard as soon as we tried them in the car.

Had a great night.  I felt safe the food was delicious. (appetizer, entree and desert) and our server was great.  Full house but he was always attentive.  It's pricey but great place for my first restaurant experience in over a year..<//review>

The steak was delicious cooked perfectly. The lobster tail was a bit rubbery. The atmosphere was nice, except for the loud music over dinner.  It made it hard to have a conversation.  The service was good.<//Text>

What a wonderful place. Located inside the W  Hotel, STK does a fine job providing great service and a quality product. My wife and I prefer to stay at W hotels whenever we travel throughout the United States especially with the bedroom furniture, specifically the beds!!  The finest  Most comfortable beds you would ever want to sleep in. A truly hip place with an  eclectic crowd and a quality steak house that rivals any in Los Angeles. A great choice with style. Patrick, the man orchestrating restaurant operations, makes you feel like family from the start. Can't thank him enough.</Review>

<Review>If I could leave ZERO stars I would. The atmosphere is beautiful but the experience was beyond upsetting! We arrived at 8 for a 8pm reservation and were instructed to wait because the reservation doesn’t guarantee a table. More than an hour passes and yet no service, no table, no acknowledgment, I will not be returning nor recommending this establishment to anyone for visits Los Angeles.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>Wow! My boyfriend and I celebrated Christmas just the two us and ordered a Christmas meal for two from this restaurant. It was packaged beautifully and they gave us way more than enough for two! We had turkey, stuffing and apple pie leftover for the next day. The food was so delicious. The sweet potato mash was perfectly balanced with warm spices and creaminess.

Wow im a fan. The steak was cooked very good, very tender. Portion size is huge for a $50 dollar steak. Service was awesome fast courteous and professional. Decor is fancy with plush soft seating. I will definitely be back and recommend my friends to this steakhouse as the best in CA.</Review>

I had the cowgirl ribeye it was delicious, perfectly cooked, we also had the happy hour lil burgers ( yes they have happy hour Sunday through Thursday from 3-630) anyways it was super yummy, but the happy hour lil burger is only one so don't think it's enough to share, but it  comes with a small side of truffle fries. The bacon mac and cheese is good but the bacon is not like regular bacon it's different tasting not bad just different. We finished off with the warm cookie and omg eat your heart out BJ's pizookie there is a new warm cookie mvp.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZBuxkGBSmDfLfwihH4lOoLLfaG39NjIzWD9kX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJhhP3y8CA9E2ndj-NJe5cLzf1eWQHBr3K4zAs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiPperVA1eVUaZnsr4qMiP0OYNHhsTIE3Vp6XK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFf3kmdz4PEPN9ntAgau8bHUa45GuxxkiiImGr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Date>1615786099166<//Date>< resp>

<GmapID>0x80c2beb0bb7b9b4d:0x8d30fe20ba2f239e< /GmapID><Review>So we were super excited to go to this beautiful place for Valentines Day. I made reservations a week before for 8:30pm. It was a $200 deposit to make the reservations and applies to your dinner. We got there and waited in line about 15 min to check in. Finally got to the front and we were told we had to wait another 45 min for our table to be ready either at the bar or stand around and wait. Mind you, there is another line for the bar which looks to be about another 30 min wait, and it's cold outside because it's only outdoor dining because of covid. 1 hour later I go back to the front to check on the table, they say it's going to be another 30 to 45 min wait. It's already 9:30pm so we wouldn't be getting a table til almost 10:30. We canceled the table and went to Denny's lol smh. They told me that they overbooked and it really got away from them somehow. They said people were only allowed to be at their table for about 75 min and staying longer, but they weren't doing anything to keep ppl within their time. So overall, I was highly disappointed with how things went for Valentines Day. The food was probably really good but I would know because it took way too long. I've never had a reservation at a restaurant and had to wait more than 15 min, if that. I would probably go on a regular day just to try the food but never again on a holiday.

*UPDATE*

Here's an update after what happened on Valentine's Day. I was contacted to allow them to accommodate me and my partner for another dinner at the date of my choice. We did set a date and went back for the on the house dinner and drinks and let me tell you, it was exactly what I thought it would be. The food was amazing, the drinks were great, and the customer service was outstanding. The manager even came over to check on us and apologized for the Valentine's Day dinner fiasco. He admitted that it was definitely a crazy night and I see that they did improve on how to handle those kinds of occasions better. The music and atmosphere was also great. The waiter, Niko, was amazing and very attentive and accommodating. They even brought us a surprise dessert that was delicious! Overall, I truly appreciate them making up for the last visit and would definitely go back for dinner and drinks. STK has become a favorite and can't wait to try other items on their menu. Definitely give them a try.< /Review>< Resp>

It can get a bit cold and breezy so bring a jacket, especially if you're having cold drinks! Make sure you check when their happy hour is! I went on a saturday and it went from 3 pm to 6:30 pm. They have half priced cocktails($9.50) and half priced oysters! ($2) the oysters were absolutely delicious.  We were told that the king crab oscar was a must have so my entire party ordered it, but I honestly wouldn't again. The crab pieces were all broken up and small, and there were tons of shell pieces inside. The location has valet parking, and some parking on nearby streets, but some streets require a permit so double check the signs!  I would make a reservation because then we left the line was extremely long! There isn't really a dress code but most people were dress very well. Their payment system is an electric check which can email and print the receipt for you.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2beb0bb7b9b4d:0x8d30fe20ba2f239e<//Gmap_id>< date>

Good service, good ambiance, good location.
Food's okay. Not worth the price. Certainly no vegetarian option except 1 appetizer and 2 sides.</Review>

<Review>Do not waste your money here! OVER PRICED! We ordered the Tomahawk Steak ($159) they served it to us severely undercooked, think Moo! Cold red center🤮 I also ordered King Crab Louis this dish was served with shells 😡  We could have had better dishes at Outback for 1/4 the price! Worst Steak House Experience of my Life! Zero Stars if I could but that’s not an option!< /Review>< Pics>

This has to be one of the worst experiences ever. Our reservations were made for valentine's day in advance to celebrate. We got there at 7 seated at 830 and left the restaurant at 1030 with nothing to eat. They seem like they overbooked by like a 1000 people. The security guard was extremely rude and unprofessional yelling at customers waiting for hours for their tables. We were charged 200 for the reservation in advance and now all we have to eat is fast food. They ruined a very special day for us. Never dining here again.</Text>

I'm giving it 3 but it's really 3.5. The ambiance was really nice. They have plenty of heating lamps so it's really warm outside and it feels good.  I had the vshort rib and it was so good buuuuutttttt and it's a huge BUT! The mashed potatoes tasted instant. I can't spend all that money and get dollar potatoes. That short rib was so good buuuuutttttt those potatoes are the pits.</text>

<review>I don’t know where to start. I don’t write reviews but this place is a joke!!! I made this reservation ahead of time keep in mind they charge 100per person to book a reservation. I arrived 10 min early to my reservation. Had to wait in cold over an hour. Just like me there was about 20+ other ppl waiting. Don’t over book if you can not accommodate. Over all this is the worst experience ever!!< /review>< gmapID>

The service was wonderful! Food and wine were outstanding. Perhaps, the best steakhouse in a whole LA! Their steaks are always juicy and perfectly cooked. Delicious. There are a lot of wonderful restaurants around, but not many that you can share wonderful memories  ! We will come back soon.</Text>

Portions are big. Steak good. Service good. The steaks were really tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. Atmosphere was very good and the service was really attentive which made the meal.<//Text>

<Text>It was a nice plus that they offer in house delivery - although they also do deals with 3rd party delivery services. We had the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala in coconut milk, potato samosa and mango Lassi's. This place is a gem. I hope they are around for many years to come! Thank you!< /Text>< name>

<text>We gave this spot a second chance because Larry (the owner) invited my party back after a bad valentines day. I've been to many of LA's higher class restaurants like Arthur J, Perch LA, 71 above and Mastros etc. Stk is definitely the spot to go for amazing steak and amazing non-steak options. (we recommend the lobster linguini for the non-steak option) and the dry aged delmonico for the steak option. Sides that were notable were mashed potatoes (I know what youre going to say they're just mashed potatoes but no you gotta try it), Brussel sprouts and mixed veggies were better than most I've had as well. All around it's a well rounded restaurant. I will be honest their bubbles menu is smaller than most but their wine selection is massive. Will need to try the wine and desserts next time around.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Worst steak I have ever had. I placed and order last night for one ribeye steak and one flat iron. My bill was 175$.  The ribeye was over cooked even through I ordered it medium, has not taste. Common this is a 90$ plate ? I won’t even pay 5$ for this steak. Shame< /Text>

Nice place for an event. Drinks are strong. Pricey though. 16 for a Jameson. Hmmm. Darker atmosphere with music at a good background level to still have good conversations.</Text>

My experience on July 3rd was great until there was a additional $100 charge to my credit card that was to be voided. I was told by my server that the charge would be voided and it was not. I contacted STK twice to have the matter resolved and was told a manager would get back to me both times and no one ever did. At that point I needed to file a dispute with my bank and everything was handled accordingly on my end. Unfortunately, my bank had no luck either and I was out and overcharged $100. I’ve always been a fan of STK and the service has always been exceptional but the failure to resolve this issue has changed my mind.

Update: The manager contacted me and the issue has been resolved. Thank you for such a swift response.< /review>

We live across the street from this restaurant and absolutely love it. The staff is always very nice to us and treats us well since we are regulars. We recently got engaged and came here for a celebratory dinner. They were so nice to us and went out of their way to make the dinner special. If you want a fun and trendy atmosphere and great food come here for a fun dinner!<//text>

Brought my mom, sister and grandma here for dinner. *( Lots of stairs upon arrival). Decor is nice clean and open. Started with the Lobster ravioli for the appetizer. The sauce was phenomenal. I  ordered cowgirl ribeye, sister had the 6oz filet mignon mom had the sea bass. We ordered asparagus, creamed spinach and macaroni and cheese for the sides.<//review>

A nice wine selection as well and a nice more modern but still classic take on a steakhouse. It doesn’t feel stuffy but rather a mixture of both classic and modern elegance which is nice.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
Go to Mastro’s in Beverly Hills instead.

STK used to be awesome - been to several around the country. This location in the W Hotel in LA has great atmosphere.

The place was 3/4 empty at 8:30 on a Friday  - I should have just walked out.

We ordered the A5 Wagyu - $30 per ounce, 4 ounce minimum - one 4oz, one 6oz. They were both bad. Gristly and bland. I was shocked at how bad they were. Everything on the plate was at most ‘warm’ at best. Borderline cold.

Ordered the truffle fries - warm. Bland.

Ordered the Jalapeño Cheese Grits - bland, not hot.

All the food came out quickly, no idea why it wasn’t hot.

A manager came by to ask about the meal - I told him the steak wasn’t good - he said he’d pass along my feedback to the chef.

The general manager came by and he was very empathetic.

Nice people all around, friendly and quick service. But the food was just not that good.<//review>

<Review>STK is an excellent choice if you are looking for a great steak and an lively, upbeat and fun atmosphere.  I celebrated my birthday here and the staff went above and beyond.  In addition to my birthday I have gone several times for dinner and the staff has always been attentive and helpful, even down to helping me pair my steak with the perfect sauce and wine.  Drinks are great, food is amazing (Jalapeño Cheddar Grits), let's just say I've never liked grits, but THOSE are unbelievably delicious.  I love this place and I will be back soon!  Not to mention, you may run into a celebrity or two.  Thanks for being great guys!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>After my experience today, I doubt I’ll ever come back to the restaurant again. I traveled from Connecticut and I’m currently staying at the W Hotel and decided to go downstairs and get a quick bite. I ordered a prawn salad which was actually really good. Jimmy was my waiter, I asked him for the check and a box, he proceeds to bring me my check and explained he added the %15 gratuity already to my tab. The total for my salad was $19.00 plus tax a %4 surcharge my subtotal was $21.64 plus the tip he added brought my total charged $26.00. Soo I’m sitting there doing the math and also feeling completely violated... How the heck do you one just add your own gratuity without asking how I wanted to pay for it your not sure I have cash. I’ve worked in the food industry before I’m aware how it goes and servers need to work for their tips but at what expense apparently mine... I let Jimmy know there was one an issue with the gratuity added it’s over %20 percent. I had a salad and a water..... He then proceeds to tell me there’s an issue with the system and they need to have it fixed. He brings it back the corrected receipt and Im able to add me own tip now and now I see how he was able to add his own tip and then rounded it up to the nearest dollar.  I asked to speak with a manager the manager came over and I explained the situation and he apologized and offered me some drink tickets. I advised he will speak with Jimmy in regards to the situation. The moral of this review is to enlighten people to check your receipts because if not you’ll have someone taking advantage of you and then smile in your face, also to expose those of you who do these types of things and it may seem minor to some people but me personally when I do decide to spend my OWN money I don’t want anyone to decide how to spend my own money and steal and scam from me.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Inside The W Hotel. Excellent food. Mac and cheese to die for. Try their deconstructed strawberry shortcake, they light it on fire. Expensive but worth the price. Huge bar. Friendly staff.</Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Simply the best steak I've had. The Ribeye. Tuna Tartare highly recommended. Great staff. Cool vibe. Surf N Turf on Valentine's Day was extra delicious. To enjoy fine dining in an atmosphere such as this is rare. With a Live DJ, and lounge areas to mingle, you can't help but meet people, spot a celeb or 2, share drinks with some interesting people and have an unbeatable night.
Food beyond Excellent - Service is world class - personal, yet relaxed. Eating Fliet Mignon with gold leaf lobster and caviar on top comes with a risk of catching a whiff of narcissistic snootiness...NOT HERE.
It may conjure up stuffy, traditional, manly, but STK manages to have the fine dining in a space where you can socialize and party without holding back. It has a vibe that is welcoming AND Exclusive all at once.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Be sure to valet. Its quick and convenient and the valets are all really welcoming. Atmosphere in the restaurant itself is great! And the staff is friendly. But it's the food that makes coming here worth it. From the Salmon, to the skirt steak, to the petit filet, to the jumbo shrimp, and even the sides and dessert we ordered, were all splendid and packed with amazing flavor. Plus, all three of my strawberry cobblers were made to perfection. My only criticism is that I wish our server could have been a lot more personable. I don't even recall if he ever mentioned his name. Aside, from taking our orders he had nothing else to discuss with us and made a rather quick getaway each time he visited our table.</Text><userid>107764186073998708510<//userid>< Rating>

Food was below average for this level of steakhouse, service was poor, bill brought and set on table while still eating entree. Not what I expected for the price. Will stick to Morton’s or Ruth Chris who deliver consistent quality.<//review>

<text>Went last night for my date's birthday. We absolutely loved it. I ordered Mary's Organic Chicken and mashed potatoes and she ordered the Mac n Cheese with sliders on the side. Food was amazing,  the music was perfect.  Then lastly the birthday  dessert was beautiful , our waiter was very attentive and awesome! We will definitely be back.

All style lacks substance. The food was good but not worth the prices, it seemed more like a club/lounge where people went to get seen instead of a fine steakhouse.</Review>

<review>The steaks weren’t really good. They don’t have nothing special.  My experience in general wasn’t very pleasant. They are gossipers and liars. A friend of mine called the restaurant and they told her that o was sitting here with another person younger than me and some other stuff no respect. The prices are reasonable. The music playing in the restaurant is loud. The service is great.< /review>< Date>

Visited STK twice during the holidays and it was super. Love the menu, drinks, service and live DJ. Great for a date night or dinner with friends. Best way to eat here is order a bunch of things and share them. If you want a cool dessert try the cloud<//text>

Great company .Great staff and service. Food is delicious as well. My small party of two was sat quicker than expected. The ambiance is one my favorites in Napa, if not my favorite. Besides all that the food is really tasty and artfully presented. Really nice people and nice service. Thanks guys!< /Review>

< Review>
The food wasn't the greatest. I ordered chicken and my date ordered fish. The chicken was a bit dry to the point I could have cooked it at home better.

As far as presentation, my date had her fish handed to her on a mini pizza dish (e.g. a black wafer) with zero condiments. The presentation was pretty pathetic considering this was an "upscale" venue where dinner costs at least 100 dollars or more

I will say that the waitress was awesome though. She was thoughtful and did everything she could to serve us and cater to us. I would have given it a 1 star but due to her attentiveness, I am rating this venue a 3.</Review>

Good service, quality meat, very expensive! The steak toppings are very rich, the au poivre sauce that I chose was very buttery and quite tasteless. The sides are good but very rich and copious so don't order too many for the table.

A dimly light and elite restaurant with good food and drinks. The cocktails are delicious at this high-end restaurant. It is great for special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. They are also available for wedding receptions and it is a great place for formal events.<//review>

Ivory was wonderful with great, attentive service. Food was top-notch. Everything was wonderful. Only downside was I had so much wonderful bread at the beginning that I didn't save room for dessert!<//text>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>My son and I visited STK yesterday during our visit to UCLA's Bruin Day. We celebrated my son getting into a great college and our time together so we selected this restaurant as a special venue close to UCLA and because of good reviews. I noticed that reviews were very mixed but ignored this fact because I love STK on Orlando so I was hoping for the same level of service. I was very wrong.

We were greeted without any interest, no eye contact, "come with me". There was something spilled on the floor next to the table, we asked to clean up and no one came. Overall, it was excellent food and poor service with an attitude. The bread was great and the waiter suggested another one and we agreed (we were hungry after a day of running around campus:-) but the delivery person gave us an attitude and literally yelled around "the second bread!" No one said "bye" to us when we left despite very good tips (the food was excellent).

When I asked about the restroom, I was told that there was no restaurant restroom, there is one in the W hotel where it's located (which is perfectly fine, but the hotel restroom was not cleaned up well and not stocked up), so overall, it was not the experience you expect of STK.< /Review>< pictures>

I've heard so many good things about STK Los Angeles. However my experience was not  a good one. We had a party of 12 on July 15th 2016 reservations were at 8pm. We were there on time. 30 minutes went by before we got water or before our waiter Kyle introduced himself. We eventually order appetizers which took almost an hour before they came out. They apologized with a round of shots. No id's were checked and drinks were given to a 17 and 19 year old. This was enough to ruin my experience and I  doubt that I will return.</review>

We strive to make each and every STK party perfect, so I sincerely apologize that we did not meet your - nor our - high hospitality standards. Though I am happy to hear that your server attempted to remedy the situation by offering a complimentary gesture of STK shots, I am sorry that it may not have been the best course of action for the situation. Please understand that this offering came with the best intentions and was directed to the of-age adults in your group. I sincerely hope that you will grant us the opportunity to show you a true STK experience and that you will choose to join us again soon.

<text>Super disappointed. Went here for my birthday dinner and was so excited for a good steak...seeing as its a steak restaurant. In a nutshell it was overcooked, tough, and flavorless. I didn't want to complain at the time since we were with a big group who was treating me to dinner, but I later wrote an email to the manager (it was that bad). He wrote back saying he would give me a free appetizer next time I went. Gee thanks.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2beb0bb7b9b4d:0x8d30fe20ba2f239e<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

I had a phenomenal experience here tonight. Absolutely raving. I've been to the other STKs many times, but tonight's experience was the absolute best I've ever had. First off, the quality of staff is superb. Our server was Rachel and she was everything. She knew the menu really well and was super fun and sweet. When I mentioned that the steak might have been a little overcooked, which I was willing to deal with, she instantly went ahead and put in a new one for me and it came back perfect. The manager, Caroline, came over to see if everything with our table was all right. I found extremely pleasant an accommodating. Then we met Lai-Ling, who was also really nice and added to the atmosphere. Honestly, they were very nice people and the quality of their service was seriously top notch for me. I really appreciate the amount of attention that went into making sure we were OK and satisfied and I found everyone in the staff to be in high spirits and they were really friendly. Rachel was seriously amazing, though, and I'd just like to say she really made this experience perfect. I'll be back and bringing more friends, for sure.<//review>

< Review>
we went for my sisters birthday this past weekend. we were running late for our reservation because my flight got delayed twice we made it right before the kitchen closed and they still accommodated us with a smile (they didn't know my flight was delayed so its not like they felt sorry for us) the food was better than i thought it would be. Im very picky I pretty much only like chicken because I'd rather not eat red meat if i have a choice and I hate seafood so I was a bit disappointed to see they only have one chicken dish on the menu... i guess people with an expensive palate don't like chicken lol jk. Let me tell you though, their one and only chicken dis was sooo good i was surprised. (please add more chicken options) . and the strawberry cobble cocktail DELICIOUS and i'm not big on alcohol (SHOUTOUT TO THE BARTENDER WORKING THE LAST SHIFT ON SEPT 21) Our server was amazing he was so nice and his friendliness was genuine not fake like a lot of servers fishing for a big tip. super nice guy i believe his name was andre. AND I love what they did for everyone celebrating a birthday very different from what other restaurants do.  THE DESERTS WERE SOOOO GOOD we got donuts, strawberry cream shortbread with sorbet, and a huge cookie icecream sandwich everything was amazing< /Review>

Food was delicious with a lot of strong, interesting flavors. Vibe was more party atmosphere and steakhouse, but did not take away from the food.< /Review>

I had a fantastic time here! I came with a group of 7 to celebrate my 21st birthday. I made my reservation a month in advance, but they reached out to me right away to confirm, and they also called the week before to see if there was any changes/updates. The hostess and server were extremely friendly and accommodating. Of course the food was remarkable! I had a del Monaco steak which was to die for!!! My sides were also suuuuper yummy. To drink I had a strawberry cobbler martini which was sooo good. My party all enjoyed their meals! You already know you’re going to be spending at least $100/person so take that into consideration, however it’s totally worth it. The atmosphere is beautiful inside and out, you can take some really nice “instagram” worthy photos.  I would def be back to celebrate another special occasion!< /Review>

Very beautiful place. Looks like a club on one side. Seen a few athletes hanging out. My only issue is the food lol I ordered crab legs. I was expecting something so different I had three small pieces of crab shells with crab meat on top on ice. I couldn't believe it lol. I sent it back cause there was no way I was paying for such a thing. Dessert was great and creamy spinach is good. Don't come here on an empty stomach cause this isn't the place.<//review>

Do not go here. Horrible establishment.  Had a party here and they kicked us out because the district attorneys family was at the restaurant.  I spent 4K for a party and the district attorney asked that we be removed.  I’m filling charges through my credit card. I can’t even explain how i was Treated.<//text>

This place is fun! It's great if you're looking for busy Hollywood night scene. Great for entertaining business clients. I see a lot for that happening here and always see people having a good time. Bartenders and staff are very friendly. My only complain is that service can be pretty slow when busy.
Their food is decent. I enjoy their petite filet steak and kumamoto oysters the most.<//Text>

i love this place, it's everything one could want out of la - insanely trendy, great people-watching, fun bar scene, oh, and the food is pretty good too!  i'm never disappointed with their rib-eye or mac n cheese, the tuna tartare is fresh and tasty and of course, can't go wrong with the chocolate molten cake.  not cheap but always worth the trip!<//Review>

<Text>This place is overrated, I had reservations at 8:30 got there half hour early went to the bar have few drinks. Didn't get seated till 9:00, waiter had adduitde,my fiancée found bug in her drink, are food took over hour didn't start eating till 10:15, the potatoes where cold and hard. Place to pricey for terrible food. The only decent thing is drinks and music. Never go here again Mastros Steakhouse way better.<//Text><user>108539955165319532568<//user><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< rating>

The service was spectacular, the mood was very set by the awesome DJ (the restaurant DJ was better than the lounge DJ), I ordered the Ribeye of course and it was fantastic. Of the sides, the Sweet Corn Pudding was to die for. For dessert I had the Sweet Potato Dounuts and they were amazing, melted in my mouth. The sweet potatoes were so pronounce that it seemed like it could have been healthy, but we all know Dounuts aren't. To top it all of, valet was great and even gave me water for the road. Amazing experience. @zoeesl<//Text>

<text>Life is good when you can afford to come to a shi-shi fancy hollywood steakhouse like STK on a whim with some good friends, enjoy some choice cuts of meat on sizzling plates, and down it with some vino and chatter while admiring the pretty people coming in.

DineLA was happening, so some college buddies and I made a date for me to try out  STK. One of my steak-and-bacon buddies had been rating this place #2 steakhouse in LA, and I had to try it. In the end, I had to agree with him. #2 steak in LA.

THE SCENE
Walked in, and was immediately impressed by the entry. Long awning with waterfalls and stone walls leads you in on a red carpet. Yes, we sure are hollywood adjacent. The hostesses are all in black, all young and pretty, and they lead you to your table once everyone is there. The tables are in a big open area, so it definitely isn't like an old-school mobster-esque steakhouse with enclosed booths and dark decor. Here it was dark, but only enough to be chic. The walls were textured and well lit. It felt slightly too masculine for a romantic date, but then again it still was a steakhouse. It was perfect for a friend reunion.

THE MUSIC
Normally, i would never dedicate an entire review section to the music, but holy balls whatever the DJ there was spinning had be in the best mood ever. Mashups -- EDM with 80s classic ballads, old school rock and kid cudi, I mean the most crazy stuff, but it was SO GOOD. I kept asking my human-jukebox friend what each song was because I could not stop listening and talking about how great the music was. Definitely will be back for Happy Hour to enjoy the tunes, wine, and cheap bites!

THE FOOD
After seeing some mixed reviews, I was worried I might not like my steak. After all, steak and I go way back, and I've been spoiled to have eaten some fabulous steaks in my day. I'm personally a char and sizzling plate kinda gal, which makes me partial to a certain Beverly Hills M****** Steakhouse that just makes it perfection. The steaks at STK were very decent indeed. The taste was spot on -- not too light a flavoring. I had the filet mignon (not bone-in) and it was still very delicious. The cut was soft to the knife, and slightly warm inside. The plate didn't overcook the meat at all. I also tried the skirt steak and the bone-in ribeye. The ribeye was pretty good, but I am a filet girl. The char was not as strong as I would have liked it, but I will take a good flavoring over an over-char. This was a well-cooked and very tasty slab of cow.

The parmesan truffle fries are rectangular 2x4 esque cuts of potato perfectly fried. steamy on the inside and crunchy outside, with parmesan that gave a perfect flavor and just enough truffle oil to me amazing.

The corn pudding was sweet but good. Very smooth. I thought it was mashed potatoes when I first had it.

The vanilla panna cotta was pretty well executed as well -- very soft, and served with nicely complimenting flavors.

OVERALL
I loved my night here. The food was not the best, but it was pretty damn good. Memorable and very nice night out on the town in Hollywood. I wouldn't hesitate to come back and enjoy another meal here.

OTHER TIPS
Go during happy hour if the price tag is keeping you away
Try to find street parking (a little difficult) or bring $9 for valet
Dress code is striclty enforced - no flip flops or beach wear
Go during dineLA -- 3 courses (steak included) for $45 and $14 for 2 drinks add-ons. GREAT DEAL.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<resp>None</resp><Review>have been avoiding it for awhile thinking it would be sceney and cheesy. glad we finally went because not only was the food very good, the service was excellent and the whole place was did not have a pretentious vibe at all!  i'm sure fri & saturday nights will be different (we went thursday) and louder with the dj but if you want some delicious food in a beautiful low-lit place, and you like meat, i highly recommend stk.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2beb0bb7b9b4d:0x8d30fe20ba2f239e< /Gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate><date>1293840000000<//date>< pictures>

The service was actually good which earned them an additional star.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c2beb0bb7b9b4d:0x8d30fe20ba2f239e< /gmap_id>< Pics>

Upstage Burger is an outdoor restaurant with a walk up window that allows you to order through a screen. The screen allows you to customize your order which is nice. The seating has views of Bunker Hill and the rest of Downtown. They do have someone to assist with you with ordering, especially big your not use to a screen. The burgers are fresh and the seasoned fries are  delicious and hot. They also carry the Impossible burger, which is a great tasting plant based vegan option. This is pricier than a Habit, but not as expensive as the Counter. Your looking at $$ for a burger, fries, and a drink here. A bit pricey but definitely  enjoyed the food. Try them out as this is the only burger place in the area.</Review>

It's a midwestern type of bar. Everything on the menu is vegan but they do have non vegan options. I do really like the cider drink (beer and champagne). They have games you can play too which can be a fun, chill nights with some good friends.<//review>

<text>Went to their website before heading over because I am vegetarian and needed to make sure there are food options for me. The menu says they have the Impossible burger but after schelping over there I found a posted sign saying they had no Impossible burgers due to a shortage, thus nothing for me to eat. They should put this info on their website so that people don't make a wasted trip.<//text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Had the Impossible burger no cheese, fries, and drink for $21. The fries were good and the burger was ok. My coworker got the crispy chicken no aioli, fries, coke $20. We both were sick by the time we got to work. Most likely some type of cross contamination. Won’t be going back.< /Review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Robert was amazing to work with through the process.  He was dliligent and stayed in touch with us months in advance of my trade in.  When I was ready, he answered all the questions my husband and I had and went to great lengths during the busy holidays to make sure we got the deal and vehicle we wanted.  Steve in Finance was quick and efficient and made that gruesome paper signing process easy and actually fun with his conversation.  It wasn't an ideal way to spend NYE but it was quick, efficient and without issue.  I have already referred someone to the Robert and I have no problem doing it again due to his excellent work.<//Review>

Edwin Rivera helped me with my service.  He was upbeat and very helpful.  I asked him some questions about other things I need to do with my Blazer and he was extremely helpful, offering a number of suggestions.  It's a pleasure to visit Sierra Chevrolet for my service and another reason that I'm happy with my first Chevy purchase.  Edwin really deserves a pat on the back.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I recently bought a Chevy Bolt EV from Sierra Chevrolet because they were very upfront and thorough with the numbers since I started emailing them. From the price of the vehicle to rebates and discounts and broke it all down so I could see where each discount came from. They are low pressure and high transparency (which is rare). Christopher and Juan were very helpful and also the finance mgr Steve Del Campo made the process of signing a (thousand) documents more pleasant and even informative.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I was a little disappointed that after I purchase my new vehicle I got home and realized it had no floor mats  I really don’t think the dealership should’ve let the car leave without mats letting me know that I had no floor mats. They will be replacing them but it is on me and my own time to go back and I live in Rancho Cucamonga and pick them up so it cost me time money and gas.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The service representatives were very nice and helpful so 5 stars for service reps. I was told it would take a few days and then was told they were backed up and there's only one guy that can work on this particular job so it would take a few (more) weeks (1 stars for efficiency, I would have taken it somewhere that was able to do if quicker). They offered me a rental at least after a week (3 stars for offering the rental, but should have given me something right away if they knew they would be backed up weeks). Finally 1 star for not charging my car battery. It's a volt so I can drive on gas as well, but come on. If you're going to keep the car for weeks, the least you can do is charge the vehicle. Average is 3 stars for this visit.< /Text>

<Review>Service did a good job repairing my car, replacing the defective air bag (recall) with my first appointment, and the control panel for the A/C and heater, and the rear door lock for my second appointment.  Plus they were great in arranging a Lyft ride for me so that I wouldn't have to hang around the dealership for a good part of the day.  The only thing I would recommend is that they call me as soon as my car is ready.  For both jobs, I called to check on my car's status because it was beyond the estimated timeframe.  Both times my car was ready, but they just had not called to let me know.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Started off my experience still concerned about the health risks due to the pandemic , but thanks to Karen and the staff at Sierra Chevrolet that quickly changed.  We were able to reach a deal online and they stuck true to their word. Karen even went out of her way to send me pictures of the vehicle which really helped me confirm my purchase. Thanks again !!</text>

We recently turned in our Chevrolet Bolt when our three-year lease ended (great EV, by the way). Andrew Lisk handled our transaction and we couldn't have been more pleased with the courtesy and respect that he showed us. Although we did not purchase another automobile (I just retired and no longer needed a third vehicle in the household), I recommend Andrew if you like to work with no pressure sales consultants.< /text>

<Review>I have been a salesman at a competitors dealership for 13 years. I know what really goes on at a dealership and I know very well how the service department (writers, techs, etc) operate.

The online appointment system failed completely. (As to be expected) but ....

When I arrived I was greeted promptly and helped out by Abe. He was gracious, did not complain about the fact that my online appointment wasn’t there, and very quickly and efficiently took my truck in and gave me realistic parameters on what to expect. He offered many different options in regards to getting me back home or back to the dealership when the vehicle was done.

Abe stayed in contact with me through out the day in a very professional unobtrusive way and was more than willing to break down all of the details of the service and its costs when I arrived for pick up.

The man was articulate, helpful, easygoing, focused, knowledgeable and quick.

Abe is obviously an asset to Sierra. Especially during the current economic times as they pertain to the auto industry.

YOU NEED PEOPLE LIKE ABE. GIVE THAT GUY AN EFFING SPOT BONUS OR SOMETHING!  No joke.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I called and was told that the car would have to kept another day with no promise that it would be looked at next day. If the service department is short handed then you shouldn't promise that the car would be taken care of in one day. I don't have another car that I can drive to work so I could leave the car at the dealership until it's repaired. I'm still having the same issue and it has to be resolved I will call GM and find out what can be done.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Dropped off my car nearly 4 weeks ago for what I thought would be a quick visit. I brought in my check engine light codes, told them to give it a once over to see what needed to be done and signed the paperwork with a "Promised delivery" of 5pm that same day... Still don't have it back.

Timeline:
Monday January 25th, I drop off the car at my 8:30am appointment time, explain all I mentioned above, and they send me home in a lyft and tell me they'll call when they know more.

Since I hadn't heard anything after a few hours I called to get a status update around noon. They hadn't even started on my vehicle yet, and finally decided to tell me that the codes i brought in meant they needed to do a complete tear down of the engine.

I checked in daily to see if there were any updates, i was told on Friday the 29th that they thought it was my timing chain and they still needed to do a tear down.

Saturday the 30th, I was able to get a loaner through them, after needing to get a rental earlier in the week because they hadn't started on my car yet.

I followed up on Monday and was told that they had no information for me yet.

Tuesday, February 2nd I'm finally told that the tear down has begun. I check in a few times that week but don't get any information until the next Tuesday February 9th.

Feb 9th, i get a list of repairs and parts that will cost more than what the car is worth, at this point I'm already considering just abandoning it and buying a vehicle at another dealer just to get things over with.

A week and a half later brings us to today, February 18th where I'm still driving the loaner they got for me, which has been the only upside so far in their service, and still waiting to see how much more than the worth of my car I'm going to be charged when I'm frankly considering leaving it to be their problem if I don't get more information or even better, my car which right now feels like I'll be lucky to see before the end of the month, even though I've already been given two possible ETAs.

I understand that parts take time to ship and repairs can take a while, but the lack of communication up front has locked me into being in their shop's mercy for the last three and a half weeks, which if I had been told up front that I might be a month before I saw my car again, I would have gone somewhere else right from the start.

I've been told they might be able to swing some discounts or cut off some hours of labor, but at this point I don't know if I'll trust the totals I'm shown because it's been in their shop for so long and I have no way to contest or question whatever they decide to tell me they've done.

Now, if I get my car back and all is well I may come bump this rating up, but so far the two stars is only because my main point of contact has been patient with my nearly daily requests for information and the fact that I was given a loaner to use in the meantime.

I haven't decided yet, but I may never be using this shop or dealership again in the future. I try to give the benefit of the doubt and as much patience as I can manage, but this has honestly been ridiculous.

-A frustrated customer who just wants his car back and to not have to be homeless to pay for it.< /Text>

Working with the team at Sierra Chevrolet has been one of the best car buying experiences I have ever had. Karen and Lorenzo provided me with amazing customer service and Steve in Finance really took the time to explain everything to me. They all made the process easy. From the very first phone call until everything was signed, I felt informed and confident that I chose the right dealership to give my business to. There are 4 Chevy dealerships much much closer to me, but there is no question that going to Sierra was worth the drive. Really want to thank you for all of your help and for making this a great experience. Also, great job ensuring your dealership is following Covid19 safety protocols. This is something that is also very important during these times.</Review>

For the most part, the service experience was fine.  My problem, and why I did not provide a better rating, was I called after I dropped by car off and requested in addition to my oil change I wanted the tires rotated.  When I arrived to pick up my car the following day, I was assured the tires had been rotated.  They had not.  I do not appreciate being LIED to.  The instruction had not been added to the paperwork, which is why it probably did not get done, but I was so annoyed at the service person telling me it had been done I just left without getting the tires rotated.< /Text>

<Review>Came in with one issue came out of there with 3 more, took a week longer than what they originally said they would. Didn't  even check 1 of the issues I told them my car had so now I have to find out what it is myself. Also, labor is way too overpriced. To change my battery they wanted to charge me almost 300 dollars when the battery was 170 dollars, So 130 to remove 4 bolts and swap the battery. ended up doing it myself and changed it in under 10 minutes. Communication was not it either. Will definitely start taking my car somewhere else.<//Review>< username>

We took our Chevy traverse in for a repair as it was still under extended warranty. We were told they could not recreate the problem. We kept hearing a noise in the front end and eventually after about 6 times taking it back to them they finally heared  it. They claimed they fixed it and it did sound better for a month but now it has come back. I have been waiting for almost two months for them to get a loaner car for us and our extended warranty is about to run out. They claim since they do not have a diagnosis of the problem even though we left it with them for over two weeks without a loaner or rental car they can do nothing. I find it hard to believe what the service manager is telling me that no loaner cars have come in for almost two months. I guess we are going to try another dealership and just pay the copay again.< /review>

Waited 6 month to pick up my 2020 C8 Covette just to find out there is a $10,000.00 markup when I arrive at the dealership. Also ran my credit score again before letting me know there is a $10,000.00 markup.< /text>

Bought a truck with a toneau cover but there was a recall on the mounting brackets. Was told the brackets would be ordered and my salesman said he would update me. a few weeks later I called to see what the hold up was...salesman again gave me an BS story and said the brackets were held up by Covid. Then a couple more weeks go by and I called the service dept who then told me the kit came in but was incomplete so they had to order the complete kit. 2 more weeks late I scheduled an appointment ot have to cover put on with the correct brackets...FINALL, but the service dept could not get the cover to fit. Keep in mind the cover was on the truck when I bought it. All this time I never received a single call from the sales person...all calls were initiated by myself or my wife.
As it turned out, I was heading to Texas for work and had to have a dealership in Texas finish the work...pathetic!</Text>

<review>I spent several months looking for the right truck and test drove countless Silverados visiting more than 10 dealerships. After speaking with Andrew from Sierra Chevrolet I decided to drive to Monrovia (50 miles away from my home) to see what they had to offer, I wasn't disappointed! I drove home with my new Trail Boss the next day and my experience with everyone from Sierra Chevrolet was OUTSTANDING, I would highly recommend shopping here and will be returning in the near future to purchase another vehicle.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>Terrible sales manager by the name of Lorenzo.
We were dealing with a salesperson, Andrew, who was very friendly and helpful.

However, when this "sales manager" got involved everything became very shady. I've dealt with a lot of dealers and they wanted me to sit around for hours while they tried to get a car from another lot, but the one we were working on had already been sold to a customer somewhere else.

They continued with back and forth not finalizing any quotes and making me complete a finance application to get a "generic quote". When Lorenzo called me to try to get me to come in for our appointment I told him I didn't want to sit there for hours playing games with a car they didn't have. He told me that I was playing games and began to give me attitude.

Lorenzo, you belong in a used car dealer. This was the most unprofessional person I have EVER dealt with at any dealer. Sierra has unfortunately losty business thanks to this "manager".

In sales, you need to listen to your customer and hear what they tell you. Especially during coronavirus, it's not safe to drag my whole family into the dealer and expose them and possibly others.

Only reason I am giving them 2 stars: the original sales person was friendly and extremely helpful so was another manager also named Andrew we met.

But, too bad some dealers have terrible customer service at the point of sale.

FYI, I didn't need a finance application to get generic quotes from other dealers.< /Text><userid>106651711911400322343<//userid><Gmap_id>0x80c2d90c044c0461:0x3c48a649be676d73<//Gmap_id><rating>2</rating>< Resp>

Coerced us into running our credit saying it was necessary for identification even though we walked in with our own financing. That will be on my credit report for 2 years and impact future applications. Lesson learned and trust lost.

Car dealerships make a commission if they can get you to finance in house. Most often, these are the worst companies to finance through and if they can, they will hike up the rates to make more money off of you rather than save you money.

Don’t trust a place that isn’t willing to put there customers above a quick payday for themselves. These people will place their wallets before your ability to secure a place to sleep at night. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!<//Text>

I recently bought a Bolt with the help of salespeople Karen and Jose, and the experience was smooth and excellent. They were upfront about pricing, and Karen stayed past her shift to work around our schedule. Unlike other dealerships, the people here know about EVs. When going through the piles of paperwork, Steve from financing walked us through and explained everything simply and succinctly. He offered to let us use their fast charging station whenever we passed through. This was our first ever Chevy purchase, and the customer service here would entice us to go with them again.<//Text>

Bought my car certified preowned. I was happy with the selection. As well as the customer service. Had my oil changed and the mechanic did a great job letting me know what else needed maintenance with out pressuring me to get it all done that day. Honest and reliable.<//Text>

If I could give this place negative stars I would. Had the worst car buying experience ever there. They are liars and conman. Told them numerous times we already had loan and not to run credit and they did it anyway which is illegal. Stay away from this place!< /review>

He said I need to paid extra to replace the battery, I told him that's impossible because I just changed the battery with AAA insurance roadside service 3 days ago. But the agent insisted that the battery is leaking, he didn't tell me where and how the battery leaking. He neglected me after I told him I refuse to paid for the battery. After I went home I called AAA, they sent the roadside service technician to me and check the battery carefully, you know what? The battery is totally perfect. The Chevrolet service believe my battery is leaking because the connector has some acid from the old one. They ask me to buy a new battery without checking it with voltage detection machine, or even cleaning the connector! What the FXXX, I mean, I paid $800 for the service and you give me this?

I came at exact 1030am to get the recall done, and then the guy told me it's only going to take an 1hr and 30min. I got a call around 1630 telling me that they didn't do anything yet to my car and they are gonna need more time, they are asking me to pick up the car the next day!
I was talking to one of the costumers that was there to pick up their vehicle and I asked him what time he came for his oil change and he said around 1200-1300 and he got his car done first.
It's all about money they will put you their least priority since they are not making money out of a RECALL.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

Just stop by to look at those blazer, I provided the lady with all my info and what I am looking as far as down payment, mileage and to email me with quote. But, so far no responses. I guess they want you sit there for couple hours in order to provide you with sales pitch. Which she started right before I leave.< /review>

<Time>1564872227477< /Time><Name>Jason Mott</Name><text>Transparency! Wow, I've owned and leased quite a few cars, and this was the first dealership that within a few emails, I felt FULLY confident that it was the right decision! Upon asking about a lease offer I saw on the Sierra website, Corey - Sales Manager - emailed me all the details - including fees, residual value, money factor - all the information I needed to feel assured I understood the lease terms. I've never had such wonderful transparency - ever.

I headed to the dealership and realized I needed more time to decide. My sales person, Cristian Zuno, was patient and understanding. I realized that I wanted a particular interior option, and let the dealership know. They found the exact car I wanted, and I picked it up that next weekend. I sat with Corey, all paperwork was ready. I then sat with Steve in finance and he was incredibly thorough - like I've never seen before. The whole process was so smooth and fast - I was in and out in under 30 minutes with my Bolt Premier!<//text><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2d90c044c0461:0x3c48a649be676d73<//gmapID><userid>117594590258067175575<//userid></record></dataset><record>

I had to drive on a flat tire to the dealership Sunday night to get the tire replaced. The car was ready for me to pick up Thursday afternoon. It was delivered to me covered in dust and with a new dent on it. Want more? Here is the longer version:
I was quoted a tire price almost 100 dollars more than the competition (over the phone). You dealership matches prices, but I had to walk in to present a printed offer (available on the website) from the competition, to get that price. A big waste of time for me. At that time, I was told the tire was not in stock but the car will be ready tomorrow. I was already sorry, since the competition did have the tire. But hey... OK.
The next day I did not get any calls to update me. I called 3 times and no one else but the person that helped me first could tell me what is going on. And that person was never available.
Next day (Wednesday) I found the same story. I had to call to get an update. I find out the tire is in and the car will be ready sometime later. The original ticket also had my claim that the car did not drive straight new, so I wanted the alignment check under warranty. I called a second time and I am told the car is ready (why didn't I get a call to be told it's done?), so I asked if the alignment was done..... No, we forgot. After checking with the technicians, I am told the alignment machine is under repair and the alignment will be done tomorrow, or I can give up and just get my car as it is. I decided to wait another day.
Thursday, I get no call with an update. I have to call to find out. And every single time I have to specify who helped me first and there is shuffling and searching for that person. The response is that no alignment in needed. So I asked then why is the car not driving straight? The response: I don't know. I am telling you what I know. I can go ask, but take time, or you can just pick the car up. By this time I've been without a car for many days and I had to deal with unhelpful reps. I decide to pick up my car. I have points I will pay partially with.
I arrive and have to wait. The car will pulled for me. I attempt to pay with points. The manager says she doesn't know how to deal with points. Asks another rep: Do you? Nope, that one doesn't know either. Only the third rep knows. "He is our points guy".
As I said in the beginning, the car was covered in dust and had a dent in the rear fender. The manager wrote by hand on my service sheet that the dent will be fixed sometime. I have to wait on a another person to come to work. This person is the only one who knows the schedule for the "dent guy". So when he is going to be in, I'm going to get a call to bring my car in to get it fixed.
Would you ever step into this dealership? There are serious training issues that seem to be systemic. It's not just one bad employee.<//Text>

Honestly, I only ever write good reviews and try to just stay away from places that disappoint. But this place was awful. I’ve only ever had great experiences at Chevy dealerships, so this place was extra frustrating. Our “appointment” for an oil change took over 5 hours. We were originally quoted 2.5 - 3 hours when dropping the car off (which is still crazy for an appointment), but this small, routine maintenance ended up consuming more than half of our day. Not to mention, we were placed on hold for 15 minutes+ at a time when calling to simply check on our car. The only positive to any of this was the nice customer service guy that kept transferring our calls and finally had to personally check on the car himself. “Said guy” is too good for this place.  Long story long, stay away from Sierra Chevrolet. I know I will.<//text>

I have a Chevy Spark which worked fine until one day I could not start it. I had it towed to Sierra Chevrolet. Ten days (!!) later they told me that I needed a new engine ($8,000).  I did not believe them and had my car towed (again! Thank you, AAA) to All-Car Specialists in Alhambra. The All-Car people explained that I needed a new clutch, not a new engine, and showed me why. I ended up paying less than half the quote from Sierra Chevrolet and my car drives like new.  The Sierra Chevrolet would probably have charged me thousands more, since they would have had to replace the clutch anyway.  I will never go back to Sierra Chevrolet; their sales people are OK, but their mechanics are incompetent. I will never go back to them. Ever.<//Text>

Service department is a complete joke.  Was told by a rep that my car keys would be left with the sales department, this wasn't done and now my car is unavailable for three days.  This was separately confirmed by TWO employees, and the only reason I brought my car in in the first place was because I received multiple calls within the span of a week to bring my car in for a voluntary recall.< /text>

I bought my 2015 Chevy 4 by 4 quad cab at Dublin Chevrolet for $45,000. When my paint started peeling a year later I got concerned. I took the truck to Dublin to have them paint it and it was returned to me with three panels on it still peeling. The manager assured me that they would bring me back and have me have the truck repainted again for a second time. After returning home I was informed by GM that I would have to make arrangements with Jesse the Suns owner of Dublin Chevrolet in order to get my car painted correctly. Since they had paid Jesse $5,500 to paint my vehicle and its entirety they wanted to know why the vehicle was returned to me with areas of the truck not painted that were peeling. I had no answer for them I referred them to Dublin Chevrolet and asked if there was something criminal going on at that dealership. They then explain to me that the dealership is its own franchise and can do as it wishes with this customers. I informed them since they had paid Chevy to paint my vehicle how was I to make sure that Dublin Chevy actually performed the work. Long story short I was told by GM 5 minutes ago that Dublin Chevy will no longer be dealing with my vehicle and GM will not authorize my painting to be done at any other dealership therefore I have a 2 year old vehicle that has ¾ of the body with damage and my 3-year 36000 mile warranty expired the moment I drove away from Dublin Chevy. How convenient I do however remember them trying to sell me an extra extended warranty for my paint and this is where it becomes interesting. The extended warranty on the pain and corrosion would have covered me for an extra four years had I had bought it but in the circumstance that my paint started peeling I would still have to argue with the dealership that I bought the warranty from on whether or not the areas were in fact peeling. In my research I have found that the dealership that I have been working with is in fact been paid to have my vehicle painted and restored completely however they did not pay the auto body shop to do the work and my truck was not completely painted and returned to its original state. I now have a two year old truck that is worthless but understanding why a corporation sells a warranty on its product is priceless.</Text>

I couldn't be more impressed with the level of service I received from Sierra.

After going to a few other dealerships in the area, I was referred over to Sierra Chevrolet.

From the moment I walked-in I was treated with respect, and could tell that your team was genuinely interested in earning my business.

I initially worked with Gus, Rashad, and Edward, who took me on a couple of test drives and explained the features of the cars I was interested in.  They were very knowledgeable, and took their time to ensure I understood everything.

Then I worked with Rudy to go over purchase options on the car I selected.  Rudy took his time and explained my options, including the rebates for electric vehicles.  Even though the dealership was very busy, I did not feel rushed, and everyone took their time with me.

I was very impressed that Rudy and his team were not pushing me into getting the car.  In-fact, Rudy told me that if I was able to wait one day, he would be able to get me a better deal since he could speak to another department the next day.  Even though he could have "closed the deal" on the spot, he did what was best for me as the customer, and took additional steps to get me a more favorable deal.  Very impressed!

Rudy came through with his promise, and called me early the next day to tell me everything was approved.  He then set an appointment for me to come-by that day to meet with his partner, Corey, so that I could be in and out as soon as possible.

The process from there was seamless.  The car was cleaned, washed, and charged; ready to roll.  Corey was super friendly and helpful, and explained additional features on the car.  I sat down with Steve in the finance department, and he explained all of the finance details, and gave me lots of helpful additional information on my new electric car.  Steve continued the trend of not being pushy, and taking his time to ensure I understood everything I was signing.

The most impressive part came at the end of the purchase.  My wife needed to sign a form for our trade-in, but she was unable to make it down to the dealership for a few days.  Corey and Rudy arranged for Gus to drive to my house (more than 15 miles away) in rush hour, so that my wife could sign the form there.  Gus showed-up on-time, explained everything to my wife about what she was signing, asked us if we had any other questions, and was friendly throughout the entire process.  UNBELIEVABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Anyways, super impressed across the board.  Thanks for helping me out.

Keep up the good work!</Review>

If you value your time stay clear of this place.  I was misled multiple times.   First I was told that I would get an estimate within 4 hrs.  That was a lie.  Then  I was told I would get updates via text. That was also a lie.  Then I had to go back to the dealership to get an update and I was told my car was being diagnosed. That was a lie.  I was then told that they were diagnosing the car and that I would be updated before 6 pm on the status. Sadly that was also a lie.   The next day I was not given an update and I had to call to find out the status.  I was told that they had not determined anything and that they don't do diagnoses on Saturday ( I was lied to that they would work on the car on Saturday).   Yet another lie.   Finally I told them to get my car ready so I could pick it up since I need it to go to work and I have no faith in the dealership and it would be foolish for me to believe the promises of an organization that lied to my face multiple times and caused me to waste two days of my time.    This is doubly disapointing since I leased my car from this dealership and had a great experience,  I was not expecting this terrible treatment.   Hopefully they will fix this but I will take my chances with any other dealership rather than go back to face this nightmare.< /review>

I wish that I could leave 0 stars. This dealership is awful. I had the worst customer service from Roger Flores. I was lied to by him and the finance person that was working at the time. Both were rude to me and ran my credit so many times when they said they were going to run it once. I called back to speak with  Roger Flores about the matter and he hung up on me and said he wasn’t going to deal with me. I called back and asked to speak with the GM and was sent to the voicemail. This dealership is beyond unprofessional. If you want to waste your time, money and get treated horribly, then by all means, go to this place. There are way better dealers I t he area and this place DOES NOT DESERVE your time or hard earned money. Being lied to and treated badly is the last thing that should happen when you’re spending money on a new car.</Text>

I was brought into the Chevrolet Service Managers office. To speak to the manager to find out why they were unable, to diagnose the problem; with my brakes wearing out three times faster in the rear than the front. I was told I was going to be speaking to the Chevrolet Service Manager, I spoke with Candis. I believe that's her name. I also believe that Candis works for the Subaru dealer. I was not told this. I had to find out on my own. I did some research when I got home. She had no idea why there was a problem and said everything was working fine. While I was talking to her, a man just walked in and sat down. He never stated who he was, never! The more I questioned if it could be; the Brake booster, ABS, portioning valve, calipers, lines, ect... He just jumped in and took over and basically kicked Candis out of the chair, and took over the conversation. He was very rude to her and me. He stated "if the car stops, the brakes work!" I also asked why they were unable to find out why the brakes are wearing this way he stated "they cannot diagnose them if I don't purchase the brakes and rotors first." I  continued to ask questions and he got more sarcastic and rude. I was told by both of them "they don't have the technology to diagnose the problem and some cars just have inherent problems." According to Abe the person who was the service advisor who I was talking to, "it must be a ghost in the system." I asked if they could at least fix the motor mount that I've been complaining about for years. He said NO.  I found out later he was the service manager for Chevrolet and his name is Keith Burney. I told him the whole point of the diagnosis was so I can let Chevrolet Corporate know, and he didn't care!

I personally feel I have been getting the runaround, if the issues were not warranty related I feel I would have been better taken care of than if I was paying cash for the work.< /Review>

<Review>My appointment for service at Sierra Chevrolet was a perfect example to businesses on how to keep their customers happy and returning. Jeffrey Marshall handled my car that day and couldn't have been more courteous, polite, friendly and efficient. Not to forget the 5-star servicing of my car
Our lives' busy days should contain a positive experience like this at every turn and connection.
Sincerely,
Dorothy L Miller, Pasadena resident (satisfied)</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>Car was not ready to take home on day of purchase.  I called and let the dealer know that I was coming in with a check to pay in full.  Only 24 miles left on the Bolt EV.  I was asked to wait an hour to let it charge.  Sales rep. told me that it would charge to 80% in the hour.  It still wasn't ready, (Only 91 out of 230 miles charge on it)  so I had to come back for it the next day. (I never really dealt with Douglas, the one I was speaking with on the phone regarding purchasing the Bolt as he was busy.)  This left me very weary of the sales office.  They did apologize after I complained about needing to return but wish it was a better buying experience.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>This dealership is head and shoulders above the rest. My sales manager was Sergio Sandoval. My finance manager was Steve Del Campo. Both provided the professionalism and excellence one should expect of a top-tier dealership.  All my questions were answered. Hell, even the questions I did not ask were answered. I walked out with one-half of the American Dream, and a big smile on my face.

Sierra Chevy - be proud of your dynamic duo!<//Review>< Rating>

<Date>1464103558940< /Date><rate>4</rate><review>Had to bring my Chevy Volt in because the hatch wasn't staying up and I had to balance it on the back of my neck to keep it up. This was a recall item that supposedly address last year here but, the struts weren't keeping the hatch up anymore. Fortunately, I brought it in before the warranty on the fix expired and they replaced the struts and did a quick check of the oil and brakes in under 20 minutes at no charge. I really appreciated that.< /review>< pictures>

Customer service is horrible and you will find that they do not fix service problems but they make them worse. They truly need to revamp their service department with intelligent service agents that know the work.< /text>< username>

<Text>My experience at Sierra Chevrolet was very pleasant.  Sergio was my sales person and he was very nice and no pressure!  That was great.  And the other employees were very friendly and helpful, too.  I got a very good deal on my Chevy Cruze that I am leasing.  I have already told friends and they are interested in going there as well now.
Thank you Sergio and everyone at Sierra Chevrolet!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

AT this point I am seeing a trend of how this Dealership chooses to do business. Unprofessional, Incompetent and Sloppy.
Check engine light recently came on, took it in, they kept it for a day, I get a phone call that the car is done and ready. After picking up the car, check engine light comes back on 30 mins later. Take it back this time the vehicle is there for 3 days, again they tell me the problem is fixed. I pick the car up, the following day, check engine light comes back on. I call the dealership, they tell me that the mechanic did check it and it was good. I asked for the list of codes that made the check engine light on, then I was told he didnt print them out. So in other words all the mechanic did was clear the check engine light and not check my car.
I talk to the Service advisor and tell him I need the car fixed, put a different Mechanic on it. someone who will FIX the problem.
Now, I have to take the Vehicle back, one week later they magically have all the codes that may be causing the check engine to come on. Something in the tune of $3500.00 for oil leaks. The car sits there for a month, without anywork being done to it, I never even received a phone call from the service advisor ( Abe). The excuse I got was that the mechanic was overwhelmed with work and there was no engine bay available.
A month a half later, picked up the Car, on my way home the car is smoking and leaking oil, there is oil splattered on the top end of the engine. I wanted to check the oil and noticed that the dipstick was broken.
Take the Car back to the dealership, one week later the car is ready. I pick it up drive it home, only to notice now, it is not only smoking but it massively leaking oil, when I called to speak to the Service manager, she was rude and condescending. Wow, Really? You have had my vehicle for over 2 months, charged me 3500.00 and provided the worst service I have ever received, from the Service advisor, the mechanic and  the Service Manager.
Talked to the General Manager, Mike Hoffman, who is a poor excuse of a manager, he offered NO APOLOGIES for this debacle, the terrible service or terrible repairs or lack thereof that was done on my vehicle. Very pompous and matter of fact, his answer was the vehicle is now repaired so he didnt see what the problem was, or why I would be requesting my money back on the labor charges, excuse me, if you as a general manager are satified with this misrepresentation of Chevrolet and Chevrolet service, I can assure you that this WILL BE THE VERY LAST CHEVROLET I purchase in my life and furthermore this is a great explanation of why the SERVICE is so POOR<//Text>

Initially, I had told Doug S. the salesrep that I was not interested, thinking they did not have the car I wanted, but he said he would work with me as he wanted my business. Indeed, he was very responsive, polite, answered all my questions and demonstrated that he was ready and willing to work with me.

On the day of purchase, Doug was off work, and Gustavo J. bravely stepped in and handled the not-so-fun negotiation over several hours; and came through for me to get the price I wanted.  He also drove for over two hours to bring the contract and car down to me over 100 miles away!  In addition, he stayed and answered all my questions, showed me features of the car, and did a little test drive with me, before going back home.  He really went out of his way to work with me!

Keep in mind that I had never stepped foot inside the dealership, and everything was done via email, phone and text.

I have been very pleased at the individual and team effort at Sierra Chevrolet. Thank you!< /Text>

These folks are great, which is why I bought a car from them with no regrets. Chevy is making great vehicles and their dealers treat customers with respect. Buy a Malibu Hybrid, support US manufacturing and get great mileage. Thanks, Sierra.</text>

<text>Sierra Chevrolet was AMAZING to us in ordering our 2018 2500 HD (10 stars). Mike Hoffman not only went the extra mile helping us but went over and beyond having the truck shipped to us in Oregon. This is our fourth vehicle we have bought from Sierra and will never buy from anyone else as long as Mike Hoffman is around.
Thank you Mike and to all involved in making this deal happen.<//text><date>1521066816743<//date>< gmap_id>

I am very disappointed with this place. I have taken my truck two times there To get it inspected and they never have time..i wasted my time and money on uber since its my only car, just for them to come up with the same excuse that they dont have time to check my car and that they have to keep it longer...i mean  how hard is it to just take a quick look and see what the problem is?...idk about the mechanics but people on the office is just horrible..</review>

I purchased my Chevrolet Tahoe at Sierra Chevrolet and continue to service it here because they keep it running great.  I have not ever been stuck on the side of the road or had to pull off the freeway because of car trouble since November 2005 when I bought my car.  They email to remind me of services required and let me know what I can get by without.

Keep up the good work Jeff!!!!!!

Fantastic, low pressure buying experience. Hit a few financing snafus, which they completely handled without making me lift a finger. My sales agent gave me her personal cell number to ask any questions.. Would recommend them to anyone.</review>

<Review>Will not recommend going to Sierra Chevrolet in Duarte.

Valerie Nottingham was our sales person.  She withheld material information from us and was deliberate of misinforming us.  We had agreed on an out-the-door price, but when we went to the finance office to sign the paper, it was nearly $3,000 more than what we had agree on.  Valerie and her team charged us for accessories that were included in the premium package and included services/warranties without telling us.  We were rushed to drive the car out of the lot  The car had missing accessories which we still don't have 19 days after purchasing our car, and it had scratches on the front bumper.  Valerie said the scratches came from the night cleaning crew.  She literally said the cleaning crew is not very careful about the new cars on the lot.  They were many things that Valerie Nottingham and her team said and/or did that lead us to believe they are dishonest and unethical.

Customers are not their priority.  The care nothing but meeting their sales quota and $.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I went to the dealer to just look around and test drive a couple of the cars. I did not plan on buying a car that day. But I saw a car that I really liked(Sonic RS), at an unbeatable price. Oscar, the salesperson who assisted me during the car buying process, was sweet and attentive. He answered all of our questions patiently and helped us to get a good deal on financing. I will recommend this dealer to other people. Chevy have won me over as a fan.</Text>< pictures>

Sierra Chevrolet has the WORST COMMUNICATION EVER!! They don’t return phone calls or emails, Rudy the Manager I’m still waiting!! Read Sierra Chevrolet’s Mission Statement that is a total LIE!! Family, pristine used other vehicles, and they thoroughly inspect used vehicles is a LIE!!! We were repeat customers and I guarantee  we won’t ever go back to buy anything! Ron Brown, who is he? He doesn’t care either!! I left voicemails and emails with NO RESPONSE!! THANKS FOR NOTHING!! I don’t have time to write a book for you but we filled out the pink repair paper before we left the lot and it says they will repair to our satisfaction. They didn’t and nobody over there cares!! I wouldn’t buy anything from Sierra Chevrolet!! Go to Glendora or Covina to get a vehicle!!<//text>

<Review>I will NEVER come to this place again. This place is run terribly. You fooled me twice, but you will NEVER lie to me again.

Don't tell your customers their car will be ready when it won't be. It makes them wonder what else you arrogantly lie to them about.< /Review></record>

<review>No one ever contacted me about my parts coming in for my vehicle this was the second time  that I had to contact  the service department to see if my parts had come in.  You really need to communicate better within your business. Customers shouldn't have to do the legwork for you .  Just wrong.  Weeks went by  without any word from the dealer.</review>< Pics>

This is a place to never come back ... They sold me a $40k vehicle with a defect in the transmission i went back and spoke to the sales manager and they only offered to help with $140 for an inspection and they sent me to a different dealer because they cannot help me after they sold me the vehicle with a defect. They told me i was on my own after the inspection .I wish i can give them a zero on the review .<//Text>

<Review>Very poor service. No calls or follow up. Sold something I did not need.
Left at 9 in morning for oil change and battery. I had to repeatedly call for info. Took all day. Still not done when promised. Needed to be at event . Told them that in morning. "No Problem" vehicle wasn't ready until 6pm. Then they could not find it.  Will not be back and you should not either.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

They take way too long to do an oil change.  I was originally quoted 30-40 minutes on the phone by the person who set up my appointment.  I had an 8am, one of the first appointments so I was assured a quick completion time.  When I arrived, nobody was able to check me in until 810am. Didn't receive my car until 9:30am, so it took nearly 1.5 hours. Additionally, the customer who checked in after me had their car serviced before mine.  I don't know what's going on with their service department but I will never use them again.</Review>

<text>I bought a Silverado on the East Coast last November, and have been having it serviced at Sierra Chevrolet since I moved here in January.  There have been several recalls and I have to say, the folks at Sierra Chevrolet have always made it really easy to take care of those recalls.   Last time they also gave me a rental car and cleaned and valeted my truck so that it was gorgeous when they gave it back to me.  I couldn't recommend them more highly.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Horrible customer service, shady sales tactics, and overall unpleasant service associates.  I purchased my 2017 Chevy Volt from these individuals and have had nothing but issues with it.  When I called to have my latest transmision related issue looked into, I was told it would be covered under the car's powertrain warranty, but when I got to the dealership they told me that it would not be covered and whoever told me over the phone that it would be was a liar.  It speaks volumes when the employees of this company are willing to call each other liars and take no responsibility for their colleagues promises.

My other service experiences with them are similar.  The first time that I went out to them, they had my car in service for 8 days with a faulty brake sensor.  In side of my car I have a dash camera, and they didn't unplug it during the service and I found that the car was simply sitting in the lot for 7 of those days, all while they told me via status updates that the car was being "worked on" as they determined the vehicles' issue.

Long story short stay far far away from this dealership.</Review>< pictures>

I hear this is a great place to buy a new car or truck, which I will never do. The service department will keep me from ever buying a vehicle here and or even bringing my truck back here to service. I have never met a more condescending, no it all,  rude "service manager" in my life. I'm not sure SHE knows she's in customer service department.
I hope this review makes you think twice before taking your vehicle here, even for warrenty work.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Shame on you, Sierra Chevrolet in Monrovia, for taking advantage of an 84-year-old stroke victim with severe dementia. Our neighbor somehow managed to drive from Palm Springs and randomly found this dealership. He arrived in an uninsured car with expired plates, and the dealership “helped” him purchase a new car as he had a bag full of cash. Not only did they sell him a car, they upsold him options, and to top it off “sold” him a 2-week insurance policy so that he could drive the car off the lot. After the purchase our neighbor became confused, abandoned the car about 400 yards from the dealership, and ended up in a local hospital as he was disoriented. Once his friends became aware of the situation and tried to return the car to Sierra Chevrolet, they would not return his money, and offered to “buy back” the car at 40% of the retail price he had paid two days earlier! Even a complete stranger can clearly see that our neighbor is not lucid and does not have the cognitive ability to understand a purchase contract. Unethical, unprofessional, and unconscionable.</review>

If I could give this place negative stars I would! This is the worst dealer I have ever in my life had to deal with. Thanks to this dealer Chevy has lost us as customers forever! And we already own 3 other Chevy trucks! I am specifically referring to the service department and specifically to Rich who was terrible! Why work in customer service if you dont want to deal with people?! He had a negative attitude towards us from the moment we walked in and we felt like he was lying straight to our face! The service department will tell you what ever you want to hear but will not provide any actual service. Every time we went to a scheduled appointment we were encountered by surprised faces of the employees as they didnt see our appointment (they dont even look in the system so how could they see them?!) They tell you to leave your car there for an unknown amount of time and when they have the time they will look at your car. To top it all of they dont even provide you with a loaner car. So not only are you left car-less you also have no idea for how long! Everytime we have been there the person who took care of us the last time "no longer works there." Bottom line they just dont care about their customers!<//Review>

This dealer has something akin to a superiority complex. I recently brought my car in to have the airbag system diagnosed. I had just been rear ended and the car's airbag light had come on with the message "Service Airbag." After talking to some mechanics and doing some of my own research online, I came to the conclusion that, at a minimum, the system had to be reset. It could have sustained more damage as well, as the seat belts had locked up, but for sure I was not going to escape the $100+ it would cost to reset the system. OK. I accepted that. So I brought it in and the parts representative confirmed that resetting the system would cost me at least $100+. My dad and I dropped off the car and the next day we came back inquiring on the vehicle. We were given a statement of work in excess of $4000 with the explanation that everything comprising the airbag system, with the exception of the airbag itself, since it did not deploy, would have to be replaced. This included the computer modules, the sensors, the seat belts, and all this other stuff. I then told the manager at the dealer that when the appraiser for the at fault party appraised the damage, he could only appraise what he could see from the outside. Since all of this was internal, this was not part of his appraisal. The appraiser's explicit instructions were to have whomever inspected the vehicle (that being the dealer here) contact the appraiser directly to discuss additional issues. The manager was absolutely adamant on NOT talking to the appraiser. "We do not deal with insurance," he said. "That is YOUR responsibility. YOU work it out with them." So let me get this straight. Most likely, the dealer is overcharging me with this statement of work because prior to showing up at the dealer, I had gotten some estimates that were significantly lower from some body shops regarding the airbag system. Yet I am giving the dealer a chance to make some money, but oh, he cannot be bothered with spending any of his precious time or energy dealing with the nitty gritty of contacting the insurance company who will actually be paying for this on my behalf. Could this be because he very well knows that he is overcharging significantly and that insurance will not agree to these exorbitant charges and so he figures that the best thing to do would be to go directly to me because I am an easy target for gouging? And then, of course, not only does he have to gouge me, he has to insult my dignity and my intelligence by instructing and educating me in a rather patronizing way that it is not the dealer's responsibility to deal with insurance bureaucracy but rather, the onus falls on the victim, who has already been traumatized enough with being in an accident. So I think I am beginning to construct in my mind what the mantra of this dealer is regarding its customers. 1. BS the customer, 2. Gouge the customer, 3. Insult the customer, and 4. Drive away the customer. OK. Point made. Since the dealer does not want my business, the dealer won't get it. Now or ever.<//text>< response>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Not helpful and no communication still to this date. I brought my car in for a transmission issue twice with no resolution. On both occasions I was told that they cannot replicate the issue. The second time I was asked to leave the car as the technician has called in sick. I was called the next day and the serviceman said they did find that the spark plugs needed to be replaced and I said ok. He said they had not yet looked into the transmission as his tech was out sick again. I asked for a loaner vehicle as this was taking to long just for a diagnosis. They approved me for the loaner vehicle which I had for a week. I had not heard for the serviceman so i decided to call just out of curiosity  and thats when I was told that my car has been ready.  Really? When I got there they said still no issues found on the transmission so then I asked to take the technician on a road test and they said he could not cause he called in sick once again. After getting my car back I looked at the mileage and saw 1 mile was put on my odometer. WOW! I asked them to road test it on thy he highway as that's where I had most trouble with the car. He said they would not as it was unsafe for the technician. Ok but I have to drive it daily on the highway. Lord save me! The paper work also said tires inflated to proper specs and looked at the info center in my car and that was a huge lie. Its just where it was when I left it. Makes me think if they truly tested my car?  So I called my warranty carrier and they said to take it to another dealership and I did. I informed them that this was approaching the 3rd service issue and this could be a lemon law requirement. The warranty carrier agreed. When  I took my car into the other dealer I told them that I'm so inconvenienced that I was ready to file for the lemon law and the new serviceman agreed as well but to at least let them try first, so I did. They were available to road test the car with me and saw the same transmission issue I did. They said it was a software update that I needed and performed it free of charge. They told me it would take a week or so to complete the software update and to come back if there is no changes. Sierra Chevrolet really cares about you enough to make the sale but after that your just a pain in their sides when it comes to service.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>George helped me with the purchase of a 2014 Chevy Spark for my daughter (replacement for another spark I had just gotten 3 months prior somewhere else), this is the first time I've been in and out of a dealership after buying a car in less then an hour, George had everything ready for me, financing was quick but very informative. Very happy with the vehicle and the process to get it.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I went twice to Sierra Chevrolet. First time @ service with Brian was great and helpful with follow ups, Called me back as soon possible. The second time was a cat and mouse chase. Every single time I called him, never answered. He would say he would called me back but never did. I called to speak to Service manager, The person that answers the phone said he
was out for a family emergency. Which this was the second day of me calling. Shouldnt they leave someone else in charge???< /review>

In a few simple words, amazing. Buying a new car can be a really bad experience. Sierra made the process painless, very transparent, very open, forthcoming and no pressure. When I got home I had no regrets and didn't feel like I needed a shower from the dirty back and forth that a lot of dealer make you go thru.
I would highly recommend this dealership if your looking to buy a new chevrolet.< /Review>

They lied about being able to sell me engine cleaner even thought they had it  just so I have to bring my car in and pay them to do it for me. I called every other GM dealership and they said they would sell me the cleaner. When I called back to talk to the sales department about it they hung up on me.<//Text>

<Text>The worst! Go in for warranty work. Multiple problems, multiple times, and all you get from the dealership and GM is oh can't find the issue. Can't duplicate.  Weird because anyone riding in the vehicle asks what's wrong maybe there is an issue.   Guess when purchase a car there is no warranty!! One of the worst experiences ever any time you go!  Then you schedule an appointment to go with a technician and arrived to "he's off". And "Only he can go with you. Come in maybe on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve since you work". Really?  No customer service in service only let me sit here and do nothing for you!  Try getting off your butt and doing your job!!!!!!!!</Text>< user_name>

< review>
Staff at the service department were very friendly. No complaints there. However, after purchasing my vehicle I had to take it in within 2 weeks because I was having some issues. Even though it was only 2 weeks after purchase I was still charged a diagnosis fee only to tell me that I need to replace another part before proceeding further with the problem i took it there to begin with. Needless to say I won’t be going back because now I’m concerned that I will rack up more fees even though I purchased an extended warranty on a preowned vehicle.</review>

<time>1537493389663</time><rating>1<//rating><text>Super slow service, schedule oil change taking 4 hours. I couldn't wait any longer and I had to take my car back. Made another apointment to Glendora Chevy where I bought my car. On the phone told me 45 minutes to do oil change and I was 2 1/2 hour late for work. This dealer is closer to my house, but drive 35-45 minutes to Glendora Chevy. Make sure financing and price locked on the exact model before go to Glendora Chevy dealer otherwise you'll over pay. I was able to save $2000 on same car from Glendora Chevy instead of buying form here. Try Capital One Auto Financing, It's convenient and easy to shop online and will save you money. Skip this dealership and save your precious time & money.< /text>< pictures>

<resp>None</resp><Text>I purchased a brand new Chevy Tahoe here and that experience was fine, about average. The service center here however is astoundingly rude. There's one older gentleman who seems to be kind and caring about his customers, however, I never had the opportunity to interact personally with him. Every phone conversation, and interaction with the other staff felt as though I were inconveniencing the people working there. Plus I was quoted a time for one hour to an hour and a half so I scheduled to wait for an hour and a half it ended up taking over 3 hours. And I missed appointments I have scheduled afterwards. They wouldn't even let me get my car back so that I could leave and come back later to have the light bulbs replaced.<//Text>< userid>

<date>1528298803809</date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>I have taken my truck back 3 times at this point(Chevy Silverado 1500-2012). This was for a simple noise. Then after your mechanics made me spend over 4000 dollars, it made a worst noise, wouldn't start one morning and seemed to be doing more damage than good to my engine.

Every time I've had to call your office for an update or the check on my vehicle. Even when my truck was ready the 2nd time I was the one to check if it was ready. If I wouldn't have called I wouldn't have got my vehicle that day.

You've had my truck at your shop again and its still there. This is all from the original noise, 3 weeks ago. I called several times to speak to Ray the guy in charge apparently, the guy who said he'd be the one taking care of it, and he's stepped out every time I've called. For being a loyal customer, 4 chevy trucks to be exact, from your dealership I find this completely unacceptable. I use two larger capacity vehicles for my business and I've had two for leisure from you guys.

Never ever recommending, buying or even mentioning you guys to anyone. It mystifies me how you are still in business.

Oh and my truck is still in your shop, Ray has probably stepped out again and I will get nowhere with this. Thanks<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Dont expect truthful information about any used vehicle they sell. They are strictly concerned about turnover. Misinformation is more in line with what I experienced. I purchased a vehicle from them in September of 2016 and have had nothing but problems with the car. I was told that they performed a detailed inspection and the car was found to be in perfect working order with only a few minor cosmetic damage to the body. So far Ive had to replace the entire cooling system, starter and now the trans is likely to be out. Serra Chevy is in my opinion the most dishonest dealership Ive ever come in contact with. Its shameful that businesses like this are able to operate. Im posting a complaint on the BBB as well in hopes that no one else has the same experience as I.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

It took them 2.5 hours just to do an oil change and they did not even wash my car.A shuttle never came by and when he did it was an hour and a half later which I was told my car was almost ready. I was told I had a recall so I did an appointment for the next day. When I get there they tell me the recall is still not in effect.</review>

We leased a Chev Volt here for 36 months. The vehicle itself is well-built American-made car.  Its service department, however, let us down each of the four times when we brought the car in for recall purpose. The check-in process is NEVER simple - the waiting area is small and shallow and the service reps hardly give genuine greetings or spared some smiles for customers. Each time I stayed in line for 5-10 minutes before being served and watched the reps slowly key-in the information - all in slow motion. That's enough to set anyone off the wrong foot first thing in the morning.  Want some comparisons?  Go to next door Advantage Ford and see how efficient and pleasant their service department is!!!

We just returned the lease vehicle a few days ago and certainly are happy that we no longer have to deal with the service department at Sierra. If we have another Chevy in the future, I will seek service from other dealership for sure.< /text>

"Top-notch service" isn't how I would describe this dealership. From the unprofessional phone call to set up the appointment to terrible communication and an attitude from the rep Maria, we can faithfully say we will not be coming back here ever and our truck isn't even done yet. I am dreading to see what else can go wrong. As a customer, we pay a service center to fix our truck, which in turn gives them a job. Obviously these employees are there to just make a paycheck and not be there for the customer at all. Customer satisfaction is not guaranteed when you go to Sierra. A terrible let down. And don't ask to speak to a manager because the rep will just hang up on you. Very unprofessional indeed.</Text>

We made a deal for 2017 Bolt EV for one lease payment and even ready to sign paper (even when they didn't have car in lot) with John Crawford (Sales) and ED (Finance). They promised us that they will call us once they will have car. I will keep following up every alternate day and John was keep promising me to get that car. Today, I walked to their dealership and that they have car for last 3 days, even on Monday John denied that they don't have car yet!!! Now they asking $5k more . I mean how Sierra can't stick to their words. John and ED you should do what you promised and keep your words.<//review>< pics>

<text>Customer Service Manager not very friendly. You  have an appointment - it doesn't matter, you still have to wait until the people ahead of you are done. Why bother making appointments!
I went in for a recall ended not getting done since they did not have parts, so they call a month later to do the service. So when I go in a month later, I tell them about another problem (small)  the visor on driver side the cover to the mirror had just fallen off. They said they would fix. I pick up my car, not fixed. They should have said they had to order the part, before telling me that it was ready to be picked up. Now another trip to the dealer. Waste of my time.<//text>< user_id>

I went in for a tire change due to a flat. I had an appt and was told tire was in stock. I was told it'll take an hr. It wasn't until 1.5 hr later when I seemed out and talked to my advisor that I found out that the car is not ready. They can't locate the tire. None of this was communicated to me nor did I feel they were working on locating the tire for me. Finally, the service manager talked to me about the missing tire. He was very nonchalant about the situation. I did not get to leave until 2.5 hrs later, missing an appt that I had previously scheduled.< /Review>

My HHR was on the waiting list for a new ignition switch on the steering column.  It was a part of the huge GM recall.  Well, worse scenario happened and while shopping one morning I couldn't turn off the ignition.  Stuck. Frozen. Period.
I drove over to Sierra and they hooked up a rental from Hertz and they met me at my house while I parked my HHR, disconnected the battery and pulled a fuse so the car could be turned off.
I had the car for one week.  I got a call that my part was in and I was able to pick my car up the next day.
I was so glad that my car was fixed in a timely manner because anything can happen when you're driving a rental.
Thank you Sierra for taking care of business.

Sincerely,
G. Murray< /Text>

<review>I bought a Traverse in 2012 at another dealership. Sadly, it hasnt been the most reliable vehicle, but thankfully I got extended (multiple) warranties on advice of family that are mechanics (in other states). I was unhappy with level of service at other dealers amd since Sierra is close to work, i decided to try them out. First 4 visits for warranty repair were ok, as my car needed to go back several times and that can be frustrating. At the time, I cant say service was excellent, but, job got done. Mind you, I was back here with repairs every 3 months or so. But this past visit, I am blown away at the semi new staff, especially Juan at Service. This person brings a class above par. I am sooooo happy to visit Sierra just because of Juan and his team. Put it to you this way, im considering buying a new Chevy again just because I am so happy with the level of Service Juan and Sierra has recently improved on and made my service a delight. Thank you Juan and Sierra for your work and excellent customer service.< /review>< Pics>

My passenger power seat switch froze, so I took it here to get an estimate on a repair for the switch.  After charging me to diagnose my seat, I was quoted $1300 for a repair as I would need a new seat motor, switch, the seat would have to come out, labor intensive, blah blah....  Went online and found the switch for $80.00, pulled the 5 screws on the side of the seat, put in the new switch, problem fixed.  Took me 15 mins to do.  I would have been faster but had to help my 2 year old use the bathroom.

Stay away from these guys, service advisors are crooks!</Review>

<Review>I would like to commend Oscar Fonseca for going above and beyond in helping me the car I wanted. I called on a Wednesday and spoke to Oscar about what was important to me for my Brand new Malibu 2LT, I expressed strongly what it really needed to have and the color I wanted. Within a few hours Oscar called me back and said I found your car. It was only missing one thing, the rear and front safety sensors. While those are important, they were not going to break the sale. I asked for a price and the next day, Oscar called with a great price. I couldn't believe it. I made an appointment to look at the vehicle the next day. I arrived earlier than expected but that didn't matter Oscar and his team were ready for me. I gave them an estimated time of when I wanted to leave, after a 12 hour day the last thing I wanted was to be at a dealer for 3 plus hours. They managed to reduced my price, wash my car and put gas in it in about an hour and half. Before I left there, my on-star was setup, my wifi was all hooked up, I knew how to use my navigation, and Sirus radio. I couldn't have asked for a better salesperson, Oscar knew what I wanted, he worked hard to get it for me and at the end of the day he made me really happy that I chose to come to Sierra. Oscar truely is an exceptional guy, he did his absolute best to make sure I was happy and I am!! Thank you Sierra Team for all your hard work!!

My entire experience with Sierra Chevrolet, from having my vehicle serviced to the purchase of a new car, has been nothing but excellent!

I unhesitatingly recommend that if you need your car serviced, or you are in the market for a new or pre-owned vehicle, you go immediately to Sierra Chevrolet. You need not look elsewhere.  Sales Consultant Tina Quezada and Sales Manager Michael Hoffman were outstanding!  I can't thank them enough for their courtesy and efficiency in providing me everything that I needed during my visit.  Thanks again Tina and Mike!

<Review>funny place. After test driving a BMW 650i, Mercedes SL 550, and a Porsche 911S at 3 separate dealers, this place said 'we don't test drive the stingray corvette'.  Go figure, I guess they think you should shell out your money by imagining what it drives like.  What a bunch of jokers!< /Review>< pictures>

The answer to all your EV concerns is available at SIerra Chevrolet.  The AV Turbocord is only available from a dealership and they seem to be the only dealership in SoCal without their head in their ass.  Save yourself some time, buy from Sierra!</review>

Aaaahhhh! It is hard to be let down by this dealerships service department when my expectations are already so low from all my other experiences in the past, but they never cease to amaze me.  Brought my truck in a month ago for basic service and the very next day my low tire pressure gauge came on.  All four tires were below 25PSI.  SERIOUSLY, COME ON!  On Saturday I brought my wife's tahoe in for basic service and first do you think they noticed the rain gutter that was bent up, which they have supposedly "fixed" twice already?  Of course not!  I got the tahoe back and in less than one hour the low tire pressure light came on showing that the left rear tire had no air (but it was full).  Since it was barely after 4PM I had to bring it back on Monday morning.  And on Monday morning they took over one hour of my life from me for something that probably should have taken ten minutes to hook up to a machine.  Thanks Sierra Chevrolet for making me over an hour behind on my work day.  Please someone open another Chevrolet dealership in the relative area! I'm tired of this.< /Review>

I called in and set up an appointment with Joanne. She was super nice, and set me up with an appt. I came in today and walked into the service office. Three men were there, and two looked busy. I approach the third and he just stares at me. He's sitting in the chair... no actually the chair and he have become one. It was as if the chair absorbed his soul and was working him like a puppet. I had already locked eyes and begun the approach so I proceeded.

At this point "Rolando, the chair puppet" gives me a "whatdoyouwantwhydoyoucomeinhereandbotherme?" kind of a greeting. I said that I wanted to get my car repaired, and that the oxygen sensor is acting up. I said I have a warranty contract that I purchased at the Henry Curtis Ford in Petaluma when I bought the car used. I said while you have my car could you see if there is anything else that needs repairing while you're at it. He said "We don't do that. We will only tell you about something if we see it broken in the midst of fixing the problem. You know, like if a part is hanging or something." I look up at their services and fees board, point to the 'Vehicle Inspection N/C' line item. "What's that?" I ask. He says all chipper "That's our 28 point inspection (starts to trail off because he knows he's been caught)... uh we uh check the tire pressure and stuff"

I'm really feeling like his approach to his job is a "Prove your worth and then maybe I'll help you" style. Last I checked we were in a capitalistic society... you know, a 'I give you money and you help me' economy. I guess I stepped into the Club 54 repair place.

Then Rolando comments on my warranty, "I've never seen that warranty before".

"I bought it at the Henry Curtis Ford up in Petaluma"

"Never heard of it. We're GMC." turns to another guy (Jeff) "You heard of this?" Jeff saif no. "All I'm saying is if they pay by check we won't take it"

Now I'm a tad bit aggitated, and when I say a tad bit I mean like the Cuban government and the US government are a tad bit different. I say to Rolando "Aren't you supposed to try the sweets before the punishment?"

He takes my contract and leans over to Jeff with it. "You wanna help this guy? Evidently I'm not nice enough for him."

Wow. Gotta say that I was impressed by the carefree abandon in which he approaches his job security. Rolando, oh giver of annoyance, harbinger of nay saying. I hope one day the chair will release you and you can enjoy life once again...

I'm posting this even though they still have my car. I hope he doesn't spit on the engine or snip my brake lines.<//text>

Sierra Chevrolet's service department is not customer service oriented.  You have to call them for statuses and it takes longer than necessary for seemingly routine repairs.  They didn't even wash my car as a good will gesture for my inconvenience.  They get 3 stars for fixing the problem, 2 stars off for lack of customer service.</review>

<Review>Purchased a used HHR in July.  The car was nice but pretty dirtry, they cleaned it up and said it was ready to go.  However, the car encountered quite a few problems and I had to return each time.  The Service department paid for the rental car on two occasions since they did not have a loaner car; this was a kind gesture.  Each problem was superficial (small things) and was taken care of within the day.  They said they changed the brakes but I don't know if that was done as it still makes strange noises and I don't know if it's due to the heat.....

For the moment, nothing major has happened and I'm hoping that it won't .  Rita in the Service départment has always been helpful with a smile.  Since I live near by I usually just walk home but have used their shutlle service which is convenient but sometimes a long wait.

Before I purchase a new vehicle, I'll wait and see how the HHR handles.  If all goes well, I probably will return to Sierra.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2d90c044c0461:0x3c48a649be676d73<//Gmap_id><Name>Charlotte T<//Name><date>1408665966254<//date>< Response>

Went for service two times on commercial diesel and paid thousands of dollars in repairs without solving problem and treated as if they were doing me a favor. I have had nothing but great experiences with purchasing new commercial truck and terrible experiences with the service department.</text>

I called and scheduled an appointment for service yesterday, oil, lube, and filter, at the Monrovia Sierra location.  My appointment was confirmed for 4:30 pm because apparently that is the latest time available during the week.  That being said I had to take off 2 hours early from my job.  I drove across town and got to the appointment 15 minutes early just to be told that the service center doesn't have lube techs after 3 pm.  This is absolutely unacceptable, why was my appointment confirmed if there was no one that was going to be able to help me?  This is not the first time that I have had issues with the service center but I can tell you that after working with the Monrovia Location for the past 3 years, I am not planning to work with them once this lease is up four months from now.  This saddens me a little because I have always driven GM/Chevy but I now feel I will need to look elsewhere.

As a bonus apparently I left the following review 2 years ago...

If you are planning on dropping the car off for an oil change at 9 am don't plan on picking it up until 5 pm or later.</Text>

Staff and facilities are fine but BEWARE! After 6 months they're raising my rate almost 40%. Make sure you factor this in to your decision. I thought I'd just be renting there a few months but should've planned for contingencies and negotiated a longer guaranteed term. Live and learn.

Also, get your own insurance. My tiny locker is $144/year through them. Again, something I would've thought more about if I knew I'd be more than a few months.</Text>

The staff is very friendly and helpful. This is a new facility and the construction crew did a very poor job of cleaning up after themselves; they left screws and metal strips throughout. The buildings are huge, but each building only has ONE dolly/cart for customer use, so plan to wait around 30 minutes plus while other people use it or bring your own.<//review>

Excellent customer service, nice facility, great temperature control, and high security. I was very happy with Letty's setup and demonstration of how to use my new lock. She deserves 5/5 stars for customer service!< /Review>

Anita was great! She drove us around the facility an extra time to go over the route and ease our moving anxieties (we moved across the country form NYC).
They say moving is the the 4th most stressful thing a person encounters (1st world problems). The service we got from this location and Anita was the MOST stress less part of this whole ordeal. Seriously and sincerely, thank you!</Text>

I just want to say thank you to Raylien she was GREAT ! She answered all my questions & made renting a storage unit fun. It was all smiles (I’m pretty sure she was smiling under her mask at least lol) & laughter. She broke down all the options I had & made sure I had an understanding of how things work. I will be highly recommending this specific StorQuest to any & everyone who asks. Thank you for great customer service ! 😁</review>

I was not looking forward to what I expected to be a long and tedious process to obtain a unit.  I was thinking I should have had my lunch first.  However, Letty Lozano made the process so pleasant.  She was friendly, personable and professional.  Letty was very efficient which made the process easier and her charm and engaging conversation made me forget how hungry I was.  She was also a good and fun driver on the golf cart to the storage locker.  She was the only employee on-site but was able to multi-task and stay calm.  Thank You, Letty Lozano.  The found a great asset to the company in finding you.</review>

The process for obtaining the unit was also a breeze. They have everything set up electronically so no wasting time flipping through papers. I would definitely recommend getting a unit here. The other young woman was also kind and welcoming.< /Text>

This place was referred to my by a friend and I am so glad I came. The girls Joy and Raylien could not have been more kind! Not only did I get a good deal on a unit but they even suggested a new Vet for my puppy. Everything was very simple, organized and quick and they showed me a unit right away. I definitely recommend coming here if you’re in need of a storage unit. You will not be disappointed.< /review>

<text>We reserved a specific unit and when we returned to sign up, it had been given away. We stayed in contact with StorQuest during reservation period but communication between manager and staff was nonexistent. Military discount discussed during reservation was denied during signing because we were informed it is only for Active Duty military not retired disabled American veterans. Overall not a good experience but time will tell if gets better. Would not recommend.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Letty and Raylein helped us move into our storage unit with no delay! The process went smoothly and didn’t take more than 20 minutes. StorQuest’s security system, insurance plan and easy access made our move SO much easier!!!
Staff is super friendly and reasonable especially during 120 degree weather.
Definitely recommend this place.<//text>

<review>This is a modern-day establishment. The staff are efficient, courteous and a pleasure to work with.
Their are on top of their business game. The units are new, clean ,climate-control units you can drive up to,
open 7 days/week. Letty and Raylene really did a great job. My movers came and I wasn't even present
The gals allowed my movers to fill my storage spaces. I highly recommend this particular location.<//review>< pics>

People are  very friendly and helpful.  However,  biggest problem is when you arrive to store items it is impossible to find carts to transport items.  You should plan on bringing your own cart to transport it you need it.< /review>

Coming from another storage place. Great move in special. The ladies that helped me Joy and Bianca where very kind, helpful, patient and knowledgeable about the spaces in giving me
Opinions. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends.</Text>

This place is really clean. They have video surveillance.  The staff is amazing. Joy was really helpful! I needed moving supplies, she pointed me in the right direction and she went above and beyond her duties and help me carry the boxes out to my car.</Review>

<review>Customer service was awesome! I was looking for something closer and was hoping not to spend more than I was already paying. Joy was AMAZING!! I reserved a unit online, received a follow up call from Joy. When I got there I was greeted by a friendly face not an eager salesman. Joy showed me the unit I had reserved. After speaking about what my needs were she showed me other units to include climate control. She exceeded my expectations!! Not only did I get a better rate. She was able to get me a bigger unit with climate control for less than I was paying. It got even better when she told me I only had to pay $1 for the first months rent!!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Renting a storage unit was quick and easy.  Joy was super friendly and knew her job very well.  Showed me the unit, explained the contract, gave me the codes and I was done in 20 minutes.< /text>

< review>
I rented a unit earlier this month after looking around at various storage facilities in the valley.  Raylene returned my call promptly and was so polite and professional on the phone, that I asked to come see the units available the next day.  She was patient and helpful and showed me a few different size units to make sure I was happy with my choice.  I was delighted with the climate controlled unit and rented that same day.  I cannot say enough about how much Raylene's customer service, knowledge, and willingness to go out of her way to be helpful, to not just me, but the other customers who were waiting as well.  She absolutely had a huge impact on my decision to rent from this facility.  I know the units are scarce, (which is understandable based on the convenience, reasonable pricing, and overall customer satisfaction) but I will continue to recommend this storage facility to anyone who is in need!  Thank you for everything!</review>

I called the phone number, and had a space reserved in a few minutes. Upon arriving at the storage facility, I was greeted, and shown my reserved space in less than 5 minutes.  Doing the paperwork took about 10 minutes. 10 minutes after that, I unloaded my car and was headed home.  The unit was.clean and cool.</review>

< Review>
Fantastic gym!  Left my old gym because it was overcrowded.  IR limits class size and there's plenty of room to spread out.  Trainers are AWESOME.  I've been trained by Vic, Q and Joaquin and they are all fantastic.  They even have me up and at the 7am class Monday - Friday; which is unheard of!  I'm a big fan of Innovative Results!<//Review>

So much equipment. Perfect for any time of work out. I love their water bars. I would say there’s nothing missing from this gym. I attend FRCms certification there and they let me work out for free before during and after the sessions. Spider works there. Super amazing guy.<//Text><user>104829849670496199440< /user><username>Henry Chang</username><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I went in for 2 classes, and it was lots of fun! Trainers are fairly good and encouraging. I went on a Tuesday and Wednesday. Tuesday, they did an upper body-focused workout. Wednesday, they planned out a conditioning workout.

At first glance, I thought the programming was a lot like that of crossfit, which put me off, but it's really not like crossfit (if you know your limits well and choose reasonable weights). I feel like the workouts are more catered towards beginners or intermediate individuals, and offers a lot of rest time. I hadn't worked out in a year, but I am a former personal trainer and a weekend warrior climber. I found the class to be on the easier side, although I was sore the next couple of days.

The doggos there are also incredibly friendly and cute. Too bad I had an open ankle dislocation from an accident, and won't be returning. Working out here was a pleasure.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Alex Osborne is one of the best. He has a gift for training and connects with his clients and tailors things based on your individual needs. He is patient and knows exactly when you need that extra push. He is a huge support when you need to stay motivated and focused. He knows his stuff and comes highly recommended.<//Review>

I've recently come back to IR in Costa Mesa. After having taken some time off (which was probably a HUGE MISTAKE) now I am back for good. The prior facility always got the job done..as its not about the place but the actual coaches and staff that help a person reach their fitness and health goals. I am an amateur boxer in the featherweight division with goals to become pro in the next 2 years. I have no doubt in my mind I will have Innovative Results in every single fight camp I have until I retire if all goes as planned. Even if I wasn't an athlete, I would come3# days a week if I could. The consistency of the program is INCREDIBLE!!! One of a kind! The work never ends here, always, and I mean always something new. The Staff is amazing, friendly and very knowledgeable in what they do. Have thorough explanations as in why you are doing what you are doing during workouts.

Looking forward to living a healthy lifestyle, get in he greatest shape of your life????? ....Well look no further at Innovative RESULTS you will get just that RESULTS!< /review>

This is the best place in the world!! I call it home because I just love being their. I work out their about three times a week and it's more than enough to help me feel real strong, and conditioned. I always feel good after a work out and seem to excel in soccer even two hours after working out. I seriously love this place and would recommend it to anyone! It's extremely unique and the environment is just awesome. Go to Innovative Results, you won't regret it!</Review>

I went here a few years ago, got fat and came back. Pleasantly  surprised to see a whole new crew. Nothing more disappointing  than to return to that old gym and it's the same people doing the same thing wearing the same thing!!
Thanks for being different!< /text>

I only have wonderful things to say about Corey and the whole crew at Innovative Results. The moment you get there they make you feel welcomed and fit a work out regiment designed for your specific needs. My favorite part about Innovative is the wide verity of exercises that make coming to the gym exciting and fun. The personal training sessions happen at the top of every hour so you don’t have to worry about making a class at a specific time. This makes it really easy for a working professional, like myself, to consistently work out. I have a really good time there, and work really hard. I enjoy this place a lot and I bet you will to.< /review>

I look forward to working out now - that's crazy! I appreciate that these guys didn't try to force me out of my comfort zone to prematurely be a super athlete but they slowly showed me how to strengthen and increase my endurance. I feel so supported and challenged at the same time. Its a great space with positive energy but the trainers are what makes it worth coming back week after week. I believe in them because I know they believe in me!</text>

If you are serious about getting fit and making positive changes in your life - this is the place. 4 hours a week is all it takes if you're committed.  I walked in 13 months ago over 225 lbs and ready to do something about it, well today - 13 months later I hit my goal of losing 40+ lbs and getting under 185. No BS - great trainers, awesome workouts, and cool people is what IR is all about. My training has brought my motocross skills to the next level. Big thanks to Aaron, Mason, Aubrie, and Mark - you guys have changed my life.< /review>

<Text>Great gym for group personal training and fitness. Focus is always on safety and fun but goal oriented to get the results you want with a great variety of exercises, strength training, agility, flexibility and function. I've been there several times, always welcomed by the trainers and encoraged and pushed to do my best. Even when I'm out of shape or recovering from an injury, they have provided safe modifications for each exercise, suitable for any level or person. I'd highly recommend innovative results to anyone!< /Text>< resp>

<text>Everyday I set foot in this awesome gym, I have no idea what's in store for me.  There is so much variety of exercise and never a boring 60 minutes of treadmill in my training session.  Every trainer is there encouraging everyone as well as the rest of the crew.  The lunch crew on MWF, is the most supportive bunch of people I've ever come across.  Aside from that, I've lost weight, gotten stronger, and my body has transformed like it never has in a "regular gym".< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

Innovative Results has been one of the best things to ever happen to me.  I have trained with them for almost two years now and I have never looked or felt better.  They really have a unique facility and perspective on training.  This is a great place to check out if you have a hard time sticking with workout plans and want to try something more interesting.</Review>

<Text>Some of the friendliest and most personable trainers committed to giving you an injury free yet intense workout. Definitely a case of you get out of it what you put into it. Small groups ensure that each workout can be set to your level of fitness and capability.You can use this as your go to commitment or you can use it to supplement your other fitness activities since this will give you body weight, strength and flexibility training. With the number of class times available M thru F it is pretty hard to  come up with an excuse not to go and each class will focus on upper, lower or metabolic if you want to select based upon your own needs and desires.They also are very aware of any issues or traumas you have had so they can give you suggestions on how to modify or substitute, definitely not a boot camp mentality but the benefits of that type of workout< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf01c8b99051:0xe697b48d5b43c3fb< /Gmap_id><rating>5</rating><response>{'time': 1475255602826, 'text': 'Thank you!

<text>I am a kinesiology student and spend a huge amount of time at the gym.  I was a little concerned about visiting family for a few weeks and not having a place to workout.  An old friend is an intern at IR and she invited me to try it out.  I felt welcomed the minute I walked in the door.  Everyone here has a great energy about them; it's very motivating and encouraging.  Hi-fives are a common occurrence.  The workouts are different every day, and they are dynamic, challenging, and fun.  The staff are kind, knowledgeable, and truly care about their clients.  Corey, Aaron, Madison, Mason, Mark, and everyone else at IR, you've got a great thing here, and thanks for helping make my vacation awesome!</text>< Pictures>

<text>I can't see myself going anywhere else. Why? 1) It's fun 2) it's effective 3) The trainers have higher education levels than most trainers when it comes to fitness, physiology, kinesiology, nutrition, body building, and psychology. 4) It's unique. 5) The culture of the clients it attracts are diverse. 6) The clients I interact with have become friends.</text>< user>

<Review>Innovative Results has exceeded every expectation I have ever had in a gym. You can't fully understand the joy of working out and getting fit here unless you actually train with some of the great trainers in this fun and upbeat facility.

I came to IR as an amateur mixed martial artist about a year and a half ago and the staff took me under their care right away and helped push me to the next level of training where I found that I was ready to make my professional debut  in my sport.

Now with a 2-0 record and a championship belt I can fully say that Innovative Results has been vital in my success and I would NOT be where I am today without them.

Go to lose 5 lbs. Go to build upper body strength. Go to look good for the summer, or go as a professional athlete looking for the edge. Why you go doesn't matter; just go. :)< /Review><user>113587829374072532341< /user>< time>

Innovative results has changed my outlook on working out completely! I used to dread going to the gym...so boring, I would just stare at the time on the elliptical! At IR The trainers and people are so welcoming and have an amazing energy! All types of people work out together...it doesn't matter if your an athlete, stay at home mom, man, women we are all treated equally. I love feeding off of other peoples energy and mostly I love laughing and having fun while I work out. Its like a giant playground for adults! Thank you guys for keeping me motivated! I look forward to coming because its always something different! :)

Innovative Results has helped me take my fitness to the next level. I have been an athlete almost all of my life and I have seen the most improvement while training at Innovative. I have learned a ton of new techniques, not just within getting stronger and fit, but also within recovery and staying healthy. Everyone there is super friendly and the vibe is great, so don't let the unconventional look of the place or the exercises intimidate you. I have learned many new exercise techniques including ropes, sleds, and my new personal favorite, kettle bells.<//Review>

This place is like a kids playground on steroids, it has monkey bars, sleds, tires, ropes, kettle bells, and sooo much more...everything you need to get a Rocky Balboa workout!  All the trainers are stellar, but Eddie Thomson is one trainer who has the perfect blend of "motivating" attitude and being supportive/attentive.  He's very knowledgeable about diet and nutrition and gives great suggestions on ways to live a healthier lifestyle. Thanks Eddie for all your encouragement, laughs and positivity.  You make workin out fun.<//text>

A great place for motivation, making friends, and getting to try a different series of workouts every week. Give this place a shot if you want to leave sweating while being excited to come back to finish another set<//text>

I've done bootcamp type workouts in the past, but it had been a few years since I was dedicated to being in shape.  As I slowly drifted away from fitness, I realized I just wasn't feeling great anymore.  The best way to describe it would be "out of balance".  I was referred to Aaron from another trainer.  From my first day, I could tell that all the trainer at Innovative Results understand kinesiology, training, and customizing your exercises to help you meet your goals. The workouts are targeted, and always different. They are always right there to help you with form, or answer questions. I'm not going to lie.  It's hard. But its an investment in yourself.  After 10 months.  I feel amazing, get lots of compliments, and have tons more energy to give to my wife, and kids.  If you really want to change your life. Call these guys today.<//Text>

I have never liked to workout...never thought I would, but now I LOVE working out at Innovative Results! It is my jam! It is such a fun atmosphere. Great people, great energy...even at 5am! Every workout is AMAZING! Get's my heart pumping and full body sweat every time. I am pushing myself to be better each day, and at the end of every workout I think "that was a great workout!"
I enjoy the fact that I have 1-2 trainer(s) there to tell me what to do and help me do it right. I am a complete novice when it comes to all things exercise and muscles. So to have someone plan a great workout and teach me how to do it properly is the best! I have been going there for 1 month now and my endurance and technique has improved exponentially. The first day I couldn't even finish the warm up...now I'm crushing it (right Aaron?!).
If you are looking for:
-great workout
-friendly/team atmosphere
-personal trainer
-a good time
LOOK NO FURTHER...You have found it! Come play with us at the fitness playground!

<review>. . .I’m on a LONG JOURNEY to health & fitness . . .
In February of 2012 I finally faced the fact that my weight was affecting my health and my future.  I realized that at 53 if I didn’t do something significant, it was only going to get harder and harder to do so. . . and I really don’t especially like “hard”. It was time to do something lasting.  When I joined Weight Watchers I weighed in at 240.8.  Something was different this time, though, and as time passed I found myself really embracing the notion that this way of life was for me for the rest of my life, instead of focusing on how I could just get through this.   In May, I became aware of a 10 AM Saturday Boot camp at INNOVATIVE RESULTS where all the proceeds go to helping children all around the world.  A friend invited me and that’s when all the fun started.  It was a really safe way for me to check it out.  My first boot camp I was down 19.4 lbs so I thought I was in good enough shape to give it a try.  It was really hard and I soon discovered just how out of shape I was!  The trainers were encouraging and inspiring and kept me from feeling like I failed in any way and I did more than I ever thought I could.  I promised myself that I would continue to go every Saturday that they offered it.  Over time, I got much stronger and more capable and grew to appreciate the workouts.  Then came the invitation to the “Advanced Fat Loss Techniques Workshop” at IR and of course I had to go.   At the workshop we learned a lot about eating, weight & exercise and it was announced that IR was rolling out a month-long challenge where the participants would engage in an exercise and meal plan.  To determine accurate results, participants were dunked to determine body fat before and after the challenge.  Well, I knew this was an amazing opportunity for me so I signed up, began working out at IR 3x a week and followed the meal plan.  I cannot believe how adding 2 more workouts a week changed the shape of my body and increased my weight loss in such a short amount of time.  The workouts are unlike anything I have ever done before, they’re brilliantly planned to increase balance, mobility, strength & fitness and the workouts change every time. You never know what to expect and you’re never bored.  At the end of 4 weeks, I was down -9.3% body fat and had -22.5 lbs of fat mass.  IN 4 WEEKS!  My overall weight is now down over 60 lbs.  I have signed on to continue with the 3x week workout and will continue to go weekly to my Weight Watcher meetings and am determined to become a lifetime member of WW when I reach my goal weight.   I have had so much encouragement and help from all the IR staff.  I am very thankful for the IR family of trainers & workout pals there and consider this entire process a blessing!  THANKS IR --   And . . . if you’re reading this and thinking that you’re too old or too out-of-shape to make changes and get fit – take heart!  If I can do it, YOU can do it!  Make up your mind and just show up!  That’s what I did and what I am determined to continue doing!  JUST SHOW UP!</review><UserId.>115123472416292893132</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Whether its going on a 10 day surf trip, mountain biking southern california trails, running the tough mudder or just playing with my kids I never feel like I'm out of shape or unprepared. Not to mention the fact that I'm never bored with what we are doing at the gym. Corey and Aaron do an amazing job at always keeping it fresh and exiting. Not to mention it has to be the only gym where you can get a workout in and run thru an obstacle course at the same time.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcdf01c8b99051:0xe697b48d5b43c3fb< /gmap_id>< username>

2015 Innovative Results review

As another year comes to an end, it’s my honor to give my highest recommendation to the best place in Orange County improve yourself. Innovative Results Period.

But..I know, I know that is strong statement to make with hundreds of gyms and personal trainer, even therapists for that matter throughout the county, but let me say that I have experienced the “retail” gyms and a few “box – fits”.  Sorry cross fit are so over rated and trainer abused with most having little training themselves. It’s a get certified get clients, get paid, done kind of relationship.

Who? IR trainers are the most evolved in the industry – with in house workshops from other experts and innovators, to continued education, personal achievements and overall experience. Be it your first time or your 100th they drive their system of health and fitness, including mindset, movement and recovery to get you motivated and inspired. They are truly are focused on one thing – Improving YOU!

What? Gains can be achieved anywhere and by anyone, but what drives you, what gets you to that next level? In most cases it’s by making goals, be it weight loss, lean muscle, strength, speed etc., the goal may not always be accomplished but a failure it is not, you always have a gain. Knowledge, experience and with IR behind you – the desire to make the next one your best one.

Why? Accountably and to give yourself the best opportunity to improve. Most people need someone in their corner keeping them focused not just that hour training but to look beyond and feel empowered to improve all aspects of your life and livelihood. Innovative Results earns my top praise not because they have helped me get stronger and leaner, but because they have helped me be a better man.

All this eclipse what you are capable of getting elsewhere...so with a New Year beginning Innovative Results is Orange County’s # 1 Fitness Playground that must be experienced.

They call me Mr. Consistent.
Shane Galitski
_________________________________________________________________

As another year comes to an end, I've had the opportunity to keep on with my healthier lifestyle by continued training at Innovative Results [‪#‎innovativeresults‬]. The Innovative Results methods and team of coaches truly understand that every individual is unique and do not all fit into the same “box”. They strive to make you perform not only physically but also mentally at your highest level – not to compete with the person next to you or others on the wall. They are practitioners of consciously reducing injuries and rehabilitating and or improving as much as possible your natural body movements. The inspiring team is diligent in learning and growing within their trade of personal training, nutrition and overall human wellness.

I am but one of many they continue to educate and challenge daily.
To know me is to know results - Innovative Results.

I represent the hard work put into a better lifestyle; with consistency and self-accountability, I am stronger, leaner and healthier because of it. I work hard, yet I am still a work in progress as all of us are both physically and mentally. So this next year has every opportunity to be my best year yet!

So are you making your New Year’s Resolutions to: Lose Weight, Work Out, Eat Healthier ???
How about this one – Make 2015 your BEST year of your life. You can.

If you are anywhere near Orange County and just want to check this place out, get to the indoor playground, and put fun in your life again.

Just have Innovative Results part of your week.<//review>

< review>
Long time Sacramento resident and having used many different companies before to save a few dollars - TRUST ME - Sierra Pacific is the best value in town. Don't learn the hard way. We had a major service / equipment install and we were absolutely amazed. I have to shout out a very special individual who is part of their follow up teams - LUIS GARCIA - Thank you so much for the terrific follow up and ensuring our system was just perfect. Do yourself a huge favor and save the headaches - go with the Sierra Pacific TEAM!< /review>

Went through Costco and Sierra is The contractor. At first I was skeptical and being my fourth quote I was sure I was just going to get a quote. I was needing to replace the Hvac system and needed new duct work as well.  Well I was wrong. Dominic was my sales person. Very Informative and helpful throughout the whole project.
The install team, Kevin C, Matt C and Devin W, worked seamlessly. Professional but fun and left my house cleaner then when they got there.
The office staff was great. They were able to get reschedule the project earlier than planned.

My system is great. Dominic added insulation to the project as well. Price was better than I expected and obviously comparable to others. Actually better because of everything they do. No corners cut and everything is new and better! They take pride in their work and am very happy.</Text>

Everyone at Sierra Pacific was so helpful and professional. From the office staff to the installers it was a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend them to anyone considering their services. When they were done with the project they made sure that everything was cleaned up and back in place. The installers worked hard and we’re very pleasant to work with. Great team!<//Review>

< review>
I called to get Spring maintenance performed on my AC system. I am new to Sierra Pacific as I just purchased this home. I thought it was great they had the planned service agreements. Unfortunately when my Tech (Big Tony) got here it was not set up, neither was my pool solar setup. Big Tony did an exceptional job on getting my system checked but also helped me get my new thermostat setup. He knew what he was doing and made what could have been a bad experience a pleasant experience. He took care of everything, I will be sure to ask for Big Tony for all my future AC and Solar needs. Big Tony also took the time to explain to me how my system worked and what to watch out for. He is a true asset to your company.< /review>

They installed a full Photovoltaic solar panel system w/battery backup. Very professional and kept me in the loop at all times. Seamless install and state of the art products that will provide us the security of cost savings and never being "In the Dark!" Keeps our internet, well pump, cameras, TVs, refrigerator etc. going when power is out! Great job guys!<//Text>

Called them out for pool solar panels. My pool is fairly warm, but would like it a little warmer. As I lived in the home I know the best spot for them. Also having panels in my previous pool I knew what was needed. The first guy came out, but brought no measuring tools, and would not take my word. Due to needs I only need 4 panels in an optimum area. He said they had to install 5, and one in partial shade. The next year I tried again, and the second guy went from 18 panels to 5 again, but said they have to check for optimal sun? I live here 4 years and I don’t know? I’ll swim in a cooler pool it’s not that bad. If they have a minimum rate, or install they should say. The salesman was also tryin to sell me a new heater/AC unit for my new home? These guys aren’t interested in the customers best interest.</Text>

<Review>I had the best service  experience  provided by the young person who provided the A/C service.  Explain every detail of what and why each thing he was checking. Did a complete service inside and out of both units that were related to the A/C unit. A pleasant person to have this interaction with. When done, he was sure I was completely satisfied.  I hope this review gets back to Sierra Pacific, a person that truly represents them well!!!!!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Had an appointment for 12:00 on a Monday at my house to discuss solar pool heating on-site.  Guy called on Sunday and said my house looked like it had too many trees, and unless I called back he would not show up.  Left a message that I wanted to talk options anyway, that a lot of trees had been removed since the satellite picture was taken... he showed up at 11:30, without warning.  My wife told him to wait 10 minutes while I left work to come meet him.  I showed up and he had left already.  I called, and he said he would have waited if he'd known I was coming home (he knew).  He gave reason after reason NOT to do the project.  My pool pump was too old.  My roof was too steep.  It was too hard to trench.  They had an 8-week wait time.  It would be too expensive.  Pool is too big with too many trees.  Too far for them to drive.  Etc..

My pool is 80 degrees in the peak of the summer, with no heater.  It is 70 degrees in June and Sept.  I wanted to know whether I could get 10 more degrees in June and Sept, or how long I might extend the season, and how much it might cost.  He asked NOTHING, did no math, took no measurements, had no discussion, just left.  The lady at the office said they had options of using gas partially, and that the technician would discuss with me.  Nope, just left and flip-flopped on the phone over and over between "I don't want to do it" and "It's impossible" and "you'll have to wait too long" and "it will cost you too much".<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1614716568378, 'text': "Chris, this is not how we expect to do things, so I'm not sure why this happened for you.

Sierra Pacific's entire crew was excellent. From the design process with Blake to the extremely professional and polite installation crew. Tanner, Mike, and Brent replaced our entire system and installed a new one in under 2 days. Work was fast and extremely professional. Tanner ensured that I understood how to operate the new system and set up the comfort care app on my phone with me. I would recommend this company and especially this crew any day of the week.</Text>

<name>Shalon Fraser</name><date>1619826480110</date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I called twice to set up an appointment and was only able to leave a message. I left a message, no one called me back. I sent an online inquiry for service, no one contacted me back. I called a third time, got a service member on the phone, we scheduled the appointment. The day before the appointment I got the confirmation call of service between 3-7pm on a Sunday. Service person never showed up. Worst contact system and service ever. This was for a pool solar heater system repair. No shows and no contacts.

Edit: in response to your reply... I have already reached out 4 times in various different ways, times, and days, to meet your company's needs in setting up a service call. You say call you directly but leave no contact information or directions to reach you.
At this point, if you really wanted me as a customer, I would hope you would be doing everything in your power to find my service file in your system and take initiative to make amends. You will hopefully find it under Shalon Warner. I have more than done my due diligence as a customer to try to obtain service, giving Sierra Pacific more than enough benefit of the doubt. Now, it's your turn to reach out if you really want my business added to your 5000 PSAs.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>We had a great experience with Javier, Jack, and Mike as they installed our new AC and heating units.  They were punctual, respectful, friendly, and didn't waste time.  They had great communication skills and followed through with whatever they said they'd do.  They kept things clean while working and did a very good job at cleaning everything up at the end of each day.  We were pleased with their work.<//Review>< Pics>

<gmapID>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9<//gmapID><Review>I first learned of Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort, Inc., through Costco.  I have experienced other repair/installer service providers and have had mixed reviews with them, though I will not mention their names, due to limited exposure to them (1 to 3 interactions with each of those I met).  With Sierra Pacific, it was shocking.  I had built a perception of some give and take when discussing and negotiating for a new installation, given my previous experiences with other companies; But, design specialist, Michael Wadman, made it a straight forward approach with honesty and knowledgeable information.  After meeting the installation crew, Anthony, Daniel, Aurelio, and Brett, my understanding of the company culture started to solidify with confidence that my decision to have them install a machine was  sound.  Their support staff members such as Elaina and Corrine reinforced my my decision with courteous and patient service.  At the end of the installation, I was more than satisfied with the service and equipment they installed.  I would also like to thank Costco for referring me to them.  Through Costco, there are other benefits that are received.  I will not go over these at this time as they may differ as time progresses, but it just adds to the already great service and equipment that was received.  Sincerely, Drew Chandler<//Review>< pics>

Had a complete HVAC system installed and were pleased with the whole process. Great price through Costco program, high-quality equipment, and reliable, friendly, professional sales (Mary) and installation crew (Tanner, Mike, Brett). Highly recommend!< /Review>

Jaron did an excellent job repairing my solar piping. He was very thorough and a pleasant additude. I have used this company for 12 years and my parents several years before me. They always come through.

<Text>We were scheduled for our pool solar startup in May, but due to a cancellation, the service was done the end of March.  Just in time for the warm weather ahead.  Plus, I called to take advantage of their spring special for Heater maintenance.  They actually came out the same day I called them.  The HVAC technician was friendly, courteous and professional, and didn’t try to sell us something we don’t need.  I highly recommend Sierra Pacific.< /Text>< Resp>

<pics>None<//pics><text>We had a water leak with unknown origin involving our pool, pool equipment or solar pool equipment. Pool person said it was not from the pool equipment. Called Sierra Pacific for Solar equipment. Garon showed up on time, took a look at the leak and took it upon himself to contact the pool equipment company to investigate the source of and electrical line in the leaking conduit. Followed it back to a remote control in the pool spa which had become displaced by recent tile cleaning. It was siphoning water out of the spa because it was half below water surface, only when the filter was on. We were so grateful it wasn’t a leak under the concrete or something that we gladly paid the service call and time even though it was not the solar. Great service!!</text><time>1619140204600</time></record></dataset><record>

We have been customers of Sierra Pacific for the past 2 years now.  I'm updating my review to let you know how good the quality and service really is. 2 months after our warranty was over we experienced a mechanical issue. Sierra Pacific came out, diagnosed, and returned with replacement part and after reviewing our service agreement, they informed me they would cover the part and labor.  I will say my extended service agreement possibly helped with this service agreement but at the end of the day they saved me hundreds of dollars, thank you!</text>

<Text>Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort installed a HVAC system in my house.  I called three other HVAC companies and they could not compare with the price I received. My design specialist Gary did a great job explaining options and cost.  He was very upfront and no pressure.  The installation crew (Anthony, Mike M and Brett) were very professional and did an awesome job removing the old unit  and installing the new unit.  They were very detailed oriented. They even helped me shovel snow so they could get the truck up the driveway.  A couple weeks after the installation there was a power surge and it blew a transmitter.  Brad came by on short notice and fixed it without charge.    From start to finish it was a great experience and I would use them again.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1614014130282, 'text': 'Petar, thank you for sharing your 5 star experience with others to see.

When your water heater goes out just before the weekend, the last thing you want to do is place calls for quotes and have the companies you are working with go radio silent through the weekend.

That’s exactly what happened to me, with the exception of one company, Sierra Pacific. Jeff, a design specialist with Sierra made a trip to our house the next day (Friday), and continued to work with me through the weekend, even though I could tell he was off. When he discovered that the tankless unit I wanted was not the brand they carry, he and his team agreed to purchase that unit anyway, making me a happier customer. Hunter, their Design Engineer, was out the next day to ensure that all the specs were known and I received a quote. They understood that we were without hot water and their actions made us feel we were a priority.

By early the next week, Kyle and Dylan, the Installation Specialists, were at the house working. They checked the boxes of what you would expect; a call 30 minutes out, on time, kept the workspace clean, good communication with an inquisitive home owner, and a check in before they left the property.

Kyle’s attention to detail was phenomenal, and the gas line work, the plumbing work, and the installation of the Tankless water heater work all look great and were done at a competitive price. Dylan walked me through the functions of the Tankless, what app to download, and its use. Extra kudos to Kyle, who came by the house the day after the installation because I had some questions.

I asked Sierra Pacific to bid on the project because they did such a great job on our HVAC replacement a few years ago. They exhibit the same level of customer service detail they did back then, and because they did not set me adrift over the weekend, and came in near other bids in the end, I am certainly happy I made the choice to go with them.<//review>

Great service from the field crew Kyle, Abraham and Paul.

Kyle and Abraham did a great Job with the installation, they were very dedicated in ensuring quality work and to finish the job timely. The ordered Air handler base would not fit and they had to construct a base on site to accommodate( Construction was State of the Art).

Paul returned to my home to complete the installation of fuse and grill. He was very friendly and knowledgeable of the business. He went above and beyond in taking care of us.

Great Job Paul, Kyle and Abraham!  your company is blessed to have you,  people like you will take your company to greater heights.

Sierra Pacific, please take a moment to recognize the following individuals:

- Paul
- Kyle Bentley
- Abraham S.

Keep up the good work ALL.< /text>

I have used this service since I moved into my house 3 years ago.
They have serviced my air conditioner and heater during this period
and have done an excellent job monitoring  the equipment and correcting potential problems that could have shortened the life of the units.
The technicians are always on time, and I deeply appreciate the calls to let me know exactly when they will arrive since I live in a gated community.<//Text>

They came to my home on time. Brad G. Was the site manager and he had the timing of the project right down to the final 15 minutes. He had Ross G., Matt H. and Matt J. The guys were very professional, hard working and respectful of my home and property. They did a fantastic job!</Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>Design Specialist, Jeff Baker, explained exactly what the installation of my tankless hot water system would entail and how the unit would work for me.  He gave me a very reasonable price quote.  Just a few days later, the installation team of Anthony, Daniel and Aurelio  worked steadily and carefully to remove my old water tank, pipes, etc and install a new Tankless Hot Water Heater system.  Anthony showed me and explained how it works and made sure I was comfortable with the information.

<rate>5< /rate><review>Our package unit on the roof was replaced with a new Lennox system by a great team at Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort.  We found them by going through Costco.  Our sales rep, Joji, was on time, professional, and didn't try to upsell more than we needed.  A technician came a few days before the install to ensure we purchased the right size unit for the size and ducting in our house (we actually down-sized!).  The install crew showed up on time and went right to work, led by Jose Romo.  His team, including Daniel Simunovich and Aurelio Torres, were great!  They worked non-stop and ensured that our ducts were sealed and around all vents, the roof was braced, shingles replaced (and matched), kept us informed about the crane schedule, and double-checked that all was working properly before leaving.  Both days, everything was cleaned up, including vacuuming the carpet, before they left.  The crane operator was incredible, maneuvering between power lines and trees - I was in aww.  I cannot say enough about everyone at Sierra Pacific H&C, including Koren at the office, who was wonderful to work with.  Thank you Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort!  You have a great team who does top-notch work!</review>< Pictures>

When the service guy  came to do maintenance and replace filter. He got the wrong filter so he said he’ll be back 20 mins. 1 1/2 hrs later he finally got the right size but charged me another $100 more then they quoted me. I don’t think ill use this company next time. Overcharged and wasted my day off sitting around waiting for the service guy.</review>

Start to finish I am wondering why we haven't been using Sierra Pacific for years!  Literally from the fist conversation 2 wks in we are sitting in a toasty warm home.  We took the recommendation of friends and contacted SP through Costco.  From the first conversation to the final sign off this has been an amazingly seamless experience.   Our Sales Professional Dominic listened, providing us detailed recommendations/options and pricing.  Not once did we feel as through we were being "up sold" on equipment.  Though the design process and minor modification made to the contract communication has been stellar.
And then the Red Truck arrived .... Kyle B, Jose and Dylan ... what can I say.  This was not a simple job .... complete replacement of HVAC and duct work.  Hard to imagine but they made it almost fun.  It was obvious that they knew what they were doing, but they also enjoyed working together.   It was loud and dirty and hectic and cold, but somehow they made it entertaining.  Team Kyle showed up promptly, worked hard all day and continued to clean up throughout the process.  We feel like the winners the in HVAC lottery.  Thanks Sierra Pacific ... job very well done!  And i am still wondering why we stayed with the "other guy" for so long :(<//review>

< review>
I contracted Sierra Pacific through Costco for a complete new HVAC system.  Salesman Jonji was clear, informative and polite.  He simply took information about our needs and expectations and then made recommendations without a strong arm sales approach.  A few days contracting Hunter came out to do a site visit.  He, too, was polite, informative and efficient.  Then a week later Brad and his crew came to install.  They got straight to work, each seemingly knowing exactly his role.  They intentionally made sure our heating was up and running before they left that first day .  The next day they essentially completed the install with the exception of a trim piece and minor exterior painting that Paul took care of a few days later.  Each of the individuals involved were professional, pleasant and seemed to be well trained (including the office staff on the phone).  They prepared themselves and our house for the work (to prevent damage) and always left it clean.  All involved showed up on time for each step.  The effects of the new Lennox system were immediately felt.  Much quieter and smoother operation.  The condenser unit outside is half as noisy as the prior unit.  Many of my neighbors have been replacing their units (all about the same age) and chose to go with a smaller family run company popular in our community.  I specifically chose to go with Sierra Pacific because I wanted a larger company that had the Costco affiliation (and associated reputation to uphold) and that had a better chance of still being in business 20+ years from now.  I also wanted a company that seems to train and retain their craftsmen instead of routinely hiring off the street.  In other words I wanted skilled, competent staff to do the install and whom I can count on to be there in the future should I have any problems.  Sierra Pacific seemed to fit the bill.  I know that even top-rated equipment, if not properly installed can cause a lot of problems.  I feel that Sierra Pacific knows their products and how to properly install them.  Our experience with them so far has been great.  I hope it continues through the years. Would not hesitate recommending them.</review>

<text>Having used Sierra Pacific previously, I called them for my AC needs. Don came out to preview the site and explain and offer solutions to my problem.  Next came Hunter (great guy!) for the site evaluation.  All good so far, even with what I thought would be issues.  On the day of install I received a courtesy call that my techs Brad G and Ross G were on the way.  Cleanest install ever, and no disruption to my business. Great communication every step of the way, and no surprises.  There is a reason Sierra Pacific has been serving Sacramento for so long, truly a quality company.</text>< Name>

<text>We were super pleased with Sierra Pacific Home Comfort when they completed the installation of our Mitsubishi mini-splits. We really can’t say enough good things about their service and professionalism. Firstly, the installation team of Anthony, Aurelio, and Daniel were fantastic. They were extremely courteous and knowledgeable, worked efficiently and completed the significant installation in two days. When finished, everything was neat and clean. Sierra Pacific also made the pre-installation process just great. Dominic was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in finding the right system, and completing the estimate for the project. When we were ready for the pre-installation site visit, Hunter was equally helpful and knowledgeable about the installation details.  We extend our sincere thanks to this professional team for your exceptional service.

From beginning to end this company has scored high marks in my book. When you are looking at spending a good amount of money on your heating and air system you want to know that you are in good hands. Sales helped me feel confident that I was making the right choice for the square footage of my home. Installers troubleshooted every quirky aspect of my home structure and treated my home as if it was their own,  and the maintenance team.... I can't say enough about them. They are super friendly and very very helpful. I will be a lifelong Sierra Pacific customer.</Text>

The technician could not fix it.  We went 2 days without AC.  When they fixe the AC, they wanted to charge a "diagnostic fee" and still charged for the "tune-up".
I was left with the impression that some of their technicians were not particularly competent and the company did not hold customer satisfaction as a priority.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

01/08/21  We are disappointed with the follow thru after the initial installation.  We contracted for a Merv 16 Healthy Climate filter and on the last day of install we were informed that no one in CA had that filter in stock.  Well here we are 2 months later and a trip to the attic shows that we still have the Merv 10 filter.  Called the office and informed them of the filter that we had and then gave them the part number of the one that  should have installed and magically they can install it next week.  My suggestion is that the person who is coordinating the installations take time to review all the items in the contract and verify they are in stock BEFORE scheduling a day with the home owner.  Also, in order to meet their 2 day installation deadline the crew didn't have time to put some of the insulation back to it's original location and they didn't have time to use a magnet on a stick to cleanup some of the screws and nails in the attic.  The garage and driveway areas were left as clean as when they arrived and I thanked the crew for that.
11/02/20 We are very happy with our new heating and air- conditioning system installed by Anthony, Aurelio, & Daniel.  Our house is now the same temperature thru out the house since we moved in several months ago.  Michael our salesperson listened to our needs and designed a system to meet them.  The crew was punctual each day and were pleasant & knowledgeable to be around & they wore their mask the whole time & shoe covers in house the house, and cleaned up at the end of each day.

We recently had a Generac standby generator installed.  Our installers were Will P, Luis R and Christian F,  all three young men were extremely courteous and professional.  The entire staff  involved in our  installation was amazing, starting with the receptionist. It's so refreshing to deal with a business that actually delivers stellar customer service.  We would highly recommend Sierra Pacific! Steve and Cindy C.</Review>

<text>On Wednesday January 13, Matt and Lucas showed up at 8:30am to install my new water heater. They were wearing covid PPE and introduced themselves.  We proceeded to the garage where the old water heater was located. They asked if it was ok for them to get started, as they would soon be turning off the water and then the gas.
They worked  extremely well together, and in 4 hours, or so, were finished. They even allowed me to paint the wall before they put the new water heater into place (I had the paint ready and hope it didn’t hold them up).  Those two men were very polite to my wife and me, and to each other. It was obvious to me that they work to high standards.< /text>< Pics>

Last year, Sierra Pacific installed solar panels on our garage to help raise the temperature in our swimming pool. After 18 years without solar, we are enjoying the pool now more than ever.

Without question, Sierra Pacific is a terrific company. There's a lot of competition in the home improvement industry and sometimes it is real difficult to find an exceptional company that is honest, stands behind their product, offers a fair price, and maintains a highly trained, competent, and professional work crew. Sierra Pacific, in my experience, ranks at the top in it's field.

From the telephone receptionists to the equipment installers, and from the service technicians to management, we have been treated fairly and courteously. Over the last year, we needed some adjustments in our solar panel operation. Sierra Pacific responded quickly and solved the problems. Sierra Pacific knows their business well and repeatedly comes through.

One additional note: Jeff Buckley, a design technician, came out to the house earlier this week to address a minor problem with our solar system. He quickly diagnosed the issue, fixed it, and then went beyond what I expected by closely examining the entire system. He was thorough, professional, and very capable. Sierra Pacific is lucky to have him on board.

I highly recommend this outstanding company.< /text>

Every interaction with Sierra Pacific has been professional, prompt, and easy from our first phone call to the final installation of our HVAC system. We want to give a special shout out to Don, Hunter, Javier, and Mike #2 for the many ways you went out of your way to answer our questions, prepare us for the next step, and take care of our HVAC needs. Today is Thanksgiving and Javier and Mike worked into the evening yesterday to insure we would have heat before they left. Jason, as the owner of SP, it is clear you have built a company that not only provides an excellent product, but also stellar customer service.</Text>

They had installed a new mini split system in my home. The tech that came out for routine maintenance had somehow busted a fan blade inside the unit when checking the temperature. He wore a face mask and offered to wear gloves inside our home.  They were quick to send someone out when I called about the issue. The second tech who came out did not seem to have a very secure face mask and did not offer to wear gloves. It's hit or miss but they are responsive.< /review>

<text>The salesperson arrived on time and conducted an inspection of our 15 year old solar pool heating system. He correctly determined it was beyond repair and provided quote.

I feel certain Sierra Pacific would have done a good job but their quote as about 100% higher than another reputable installer. For instance, SP quoted removal of the old unit was $675 and the other company quoted $250. Also, I was advised there could be other charges once the project was underway.

Seems Sierra Pacific is so busy due to everyone staying home this COVID Summer that they can make a huge profit off those who do not do comparison shopping.< /text><Rating>3</Rating><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1597264888188< /Time>< user_name>

My name is Joe, and I live in Yuba City California. Carlos came and installed my Easy Touch PL -4 to my pool pump to heat my pool.  He did a very professional job and explained everything as he went as to what he was doing, and why he was doing it. After he was done and gone, I had a few questions and I called. He called me back right away and answered all my questions and took me through everything, step-by-step. By doing this it was easier for me to understand how the system worked.  This way, I understood why the settings were the way they were and how they operated. I give Carlos a five star rating for a job well done.     Thanks</Text>

The install crew was punctual and spent the day installing the solar equipment and keeping me updated on their progress. Tyler, Devin, and Ryan were extremely professional and Tyler did a great job going over the operation of the solar system and how to winterize the system and do the reverse at the beginning of the season. I waited a few days to see if the system worked properly and it has definitely made a big difference in our pool temperatures. My kids and I were able night swim over the weekend because the pool so heated up high enough for us to enjoy the pool.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1589930717771, 'text': 'Thank you for the great testimonial about our solar pool team!

<Review>I went into this office to get an estimate on an A/C repair I needed and I was appalled! They are not requiring masks and by what I saw, cannot effectively social distance! They have absolutely no excuse to not be wearing masks! I saw them all interacting when I went in. I wouldn't want to work there! I most certainly will not be using their services. I highly recommend you examine whether or not they should be allowed to serve the public with the blatant disregard for the safety of their employees and by extention, customers. This place is very bad!

Thank you, please wear a mask, please social distance, and please stay safe!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

It took two days instead of one for the install, because the first crew had a bit of trouble with the sheet metal.  I have to admit they made it right with a second more professional installer.

We have a built in pool that was having communication issues thru the Hayward ProLogic Controller. Sierra Pacific has had for years our annual contract for the pools solar heating system and they do the yearly start-up & shut down of the system. When I noticed the error codes showing this week on my controller, I called SP to come repair it. Their tech Martin quickly diagnosed the system accurately and found a loose wire causing the error. Instead of us thinking it was a major component failure with a heavy cost, no, instead it was a quick and easy fix. I suggest you use Sierra Pacific for your pool equipment service requirements = well done!<//Text>

The installers arrived on time and work quickly and efficiently.
I informed the install team that I had a doctor’s appointment a 4:00 PM.
They had air-conditioner working and everything cleaned up by 3:10PM
I had no problem getting to my appointment by 4:00PM.
The crew was highly informative and pleasant to work with, thanks to them I would highly
recommend Sierra Pacific to all my friends.

Andrew and Matt made sure the installation was to code, neat and orderly.  They cleaned up afterwards and left the job site immaculate.

You may pay a little more for Sierra Pacific to do the job, but the courtesy, punctuality, and professionalism of the office staff, sales and installation teams is well worth it.  This is the fourth job I have contracted with Sierra Pacific; solar electric, solar pool heater, windows and sliding doors,  and now a water heater.  The experience was exactly the same - outstanding from beginning to end.  I can't tell you how nice it is to have confidence that you are dealing with a first class, reputable company.  Also, having six years of experience with them, I can tell you their service after the install is excellent.  Any issues are resolved quickly to my satisfaction.

Eric Wirth has been out twice, first time to perform gateway install. While doing the install he found a failing component in control unit and also found that one of our panels was not working. But the biggest issue he found was that our control unit was "going to sleep" and not producing electricity as it should. He fixed the last problem immediately and ordered warranty replacement parts for the other two issues. Once parts arrived, he came back, about 10 days later and installed them. Eric is very knowledgeable and goes the extra mile to find and fix problems. He is a friendly and personable tech and was a joy to work with. We are looking forward to improved functioning of our system. I would highly recommend Sierra Pacific and Eric without reservation. John Santos< /Review>

Costco contracts with Sierra Pacific for HVAC systems. My sales rep, Gary listened to my demands and expectations and proceeded to put together a quote on the spot - everything clearly outlined and explained. My wife and I decided to proceed to have Sierra Pacific replace our 20 year old systems. The next step - digitallt sign docs was a breeze and then setting up a schedule for an preinstall inspection occured.
The day before the appointment, SP called to remind me that they would be at my house the next morning and they did. 20 minutes before 8am, I receieved a call Brad, from the Lead for the team of three that they should be there soon. And they were.
Everything was explained to me and how they would proceed for the 1st half of my two units to be replaced. After papers were signed, they worked diligently and efficiently.
I would HIGHLY recommend working through Costco and with Sierra Pacific for any HVAC, Solar, window, repair work. All three on the team: Brad, Ross and Matt were a peasure to meet and recognize pride of work well done!</Text>

They got me a great deal for a whole  new HVAC system and they had  a good selection of options. The team who installed the system were great. Very friendly and nice and they were always on time, according to the schedule we set. They picked up at the end of each day. They informed me of any potential changes immediately and got my approval.</Review>

I hope that her work to resolve this would cause you to revise your review of our company. As you know from the many years of service we pride ourselves on being a reliable and trustworthy company. We work so hard to train our craftsmen to do this specialty solar work in a safe and competent manner. There is not a training school to hire people who are capable of this work, every solar pool technician is 100% trained by our experienced managers. Moreover the rules for the work place in California have driven up the cost of running and maintaining a service truck and the people doing the work. As such there is a high cost to train and keep the experts that our clients really like and trust. I'm proud of the friendly and honest character of our team and it takes a tremendous investment in them for our company to be able to serve our clients with the high standards we are known for. I do hope we get an opportunity serve you again.\nRespectfully,\nJason Hanson\nPresident"}</response>

<review>WILL NEVER USE AGAIN!!

We have been long time Sierra Pacific pool solar customers. We installed our pool solar around 2003. For many years, we have been happy customers
as Sierra Pacific had taken good care of us. For the last 2 years, their pool solar support fees have gotten so high, they are losing this customer
forever. Last spring, we contacted them about replacing a solar sensor on the roof. This part goes out every 3-4 years.Their minimum service fee is
now $198, just to come out to the house. This is the highest minimum service fee I have ever heard of, and is exorbitant for the services provided.
Then the price of the sensor was $198. This is a simple sensor I can find for less than $50 in multiple sites.

This year we requested them to come out to fix a different part on the roof. Again another $198 solar service fee for the trip, and $298 for the
part which I can find for less than $40. I declined this outrageous pricing and will replace the item myself. Then when the service technician left our
property, he damaged a new concrete curbing we just had poured. That repair will cost another $150, and Sierra Pacific will not return my call about
their responsibility to pay for it. I immediately called as soon as I saw the damage and left a voice message for the service manager. I called agin
24 hours later after I didn't receive a call back. I then called a third time another 24 hours later and still no call back as promised.

I have no idea what changed in the last 2 years, but their pool solar support value has gone dramatically downhill.

Due to their inability to take responsibility for the damage, and their outrageous support costs, they have driven us away for good.</review>< time>

The Install team from Sierra Pacific was fantastic! Gabriel, Matt and Avrelio did a great job. They worked hard and fast, were thorough and were very good about cleaning up after themselves. They went above and beyond what I expected and were very responsive to questions and concerns.

The Design Specialist was decent until we were told that we actually didn't qualify for a last minute deal we were promised. This was very disappointing as we had to pay the entirety of the contract up front for this deal so there was a little bit of financial pressure on our end. When we were told a day later that we didn't qualify for said deal, we asked what Sierra Pacific was going to do to make this mistake right as it was a $750 value we were losing out on. Their response was that the company would not do anything and if we wanted to cancel that is fine "there are 50 other people wanting installs, so it is completely up to you".  At the end of the day we were still receiving more work for our money compared to other quotes we received and we kept our contract with them (minus the $750).  The technicians were amazing, we now have a fantastic HVAC system, however the Company did not make me feel as though my business mattered to them.<//text>

Sierra Pacific has installed both my Lennox heating & air system (2014) and my new AO Smith water heater (2019).  I purchased both through the Costco program.  Their people are knowledgeable and courteous.  And, when I had an issue with my new water heater, their team responded quickly, placing customer service above all else.  I am very thankful for their after sale support.</text>

Very pleased with the service from start to finish. Everyone from the sales, to the pre-install walk through to installation showed up on time and ready to go. Although it did take two days for the install Kyle & Abraham never slowed down. they were polite, professional and made sure to communicate with us throughout the install.

We couldn't be happier with our experience.</Text>

I've been using Sierra Pacific each year since they installed my pool's solar heating in 2013. At the start of every swim season I have had to call them to repairs leaks in the solar collectors. The service techs they have sent out are professional and quickly diagnose the problem and repair it, as well as checking other components of the system for leaks. I would have given Sierra Pacific 5 stars for this review, but for each of this year's 2 service calls, they have quoted me $198 for the in-warranty repairs, instead of the $97 charge I have paid every year before this. After reminding them that this is a 105% increase over previous years, and this is an in-warranty repair and not a full service, they have agreed to charge the standard $97.</Text>

Regarding the cost of doing this solar service work, yes it has increased. There is increased cost from the State of California for performing this kind of work and operating this kind of business. Every year the cost to train our service team on safe practices, new technology, and increased compliance protocols is something we are contending with. As you can see, we offer significant discounts to our Planned Service clients and I encourage you to take advantage of this program.

<Review>Another scam solar company, using cheap products and exploiting Americans with 600%+ price increase. You will never make up your money in 30+ years< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1610740774752, 'text': 'N G, I think maybe you have the wrong company here. Panasonic panels are the top rated panel in North American with an amazing warranty, so they are not cheap products. Which is why I think you may have confused our company with another company. Regarding Return On Investment (ROI) with solar - it varies by your utility company, your rate structure you are on with electric rates, how much energy you use, and how easy (or difficult/costly) it is to install solar and connect to your electric panel at your home. Many PG&E customers have about an 8 year payback time. Customers in other utilities have 20-30 year payback time. There are so many variables, so we always recommend an on-site visit from one of our trained and experienced Design Specialists. Then you can make the best decision for your situation. It sounds like maybe you were not a good candidate for solar. I wish you well.\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}< /response>< gmapID>

We had called Sierra Pacific to give us a quote to install a solar pool heater.. they give an appointment more than a week later.. I was already surprised because all other companies came the very next morning and within 10 min got a quote.. we kind of already fixed who we will go with and today is the 2nd day after the promised day off quote.. no one has shown up. We were supposed to confirm our quote with the other vendor last week but just thought of waiting for Sierra. I think these reviews are all paid because a company with this much rating will not do this. Highly disappointed!!!< /text>

I had a ground rack of solar panels installed by Mat, Luis, Luis Jr., & Jon.  They are a top notch install team.  You can depend on them to be polite, efficient, answer questions, clean up, take pride in their workmanship and you can trust them to do the job right.  They did a professional job on my ground rack.  Could not ask for more.  They would be my go to team.</Review>

I had 3 FAFCO Solar panels replaced today. My original appointment for March was postponed due to the shut down, but Sierra Pacific was great when I called to reschedule the work to get my pool going again. My technician, Bob, was a great guy. Got here on time, finished the job efficiently and helped me by explaining some things I had questions about. Overall, another great experience with Sierra Pacific Home and Comfort!

have been awesome with customer service and that is why we went with
them when we decided to put solar on our house. They were all very
professional we were very happy with the hole team Justin in sales, Jason coordinator, Brandon, Chris and Javler installers and the person that did the final was also wonderful but I can't remember his name : (.

I got solar through them and my bill is actually more than what it was prior to not having solar. Very misleading advertisement.  I asked how solar increases the value of my home and how having solar is better than the stock market and have yet to get an explanation. I cannot refinance my home now. Honestly, because my home is on the smaller side and a little out dated I would have probably benefited more from having new windows and doors installed and for a fraction of the price. But making 3 times as much on solar is more lucrative is my guess. I would not use them for anything. Dishonest and misleading promises by Mr. Hanson.</Text>

<review>This is the 2nd system we purchased from Sierra Pacific.  Our first was a pool solar heating system.  This last purchase was an HVAC replacement system.  From sales to installation we were delighted with the service.  All of the teams where on time, patient, respectful, knowledgeable and no high pressure sales.  HVAC replacement is a big expense, but with the Costco and PGE rebates we were able to get a high efficiency system for a good price.  Very happy with Sierra Pacific and would recommend them.    They make it very easy to do business with.  Thanks SP!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Francisco, Fernando and Hector installed our new HVAC yesterday and finished today. Nice guys, all were introduced when they first got here. So glad the weather cooled down as those guys were going upstairs and into the attic all day long. They were clean, always covering up our stairs and clothes in closet, wearing show coverings etc. Really hard workers! Francisco, the lead, frequently updated us on the progress of the job and any issues encountered (there were none). He explained all the new connections and things they replaced. So patient with us in setting up the new thermostat and waited until we got the wifi connected. Explained all the paperwork and took the time to verify with the office regarding a small change to the contract. Overall we are very, very satisfied with these guys.<//Review>

<Review>Sierra Pacific is amazing. With a last minute request, due to closing escroe on our house, we had Dave T, and Lorenzo out to take off the pool solar panels and reinstall the following day! They got the job done on time and fired up the solar for the year. I couldn't ask for anything better! Dave T. should be called Super Dave!</Review></record>

My wife and I have been customers of Sierra Pacific for many years. We have ALWAYS received excellent service from Sierra Pacific's employees. Everyone we have encountered has always been professional, polite, friendly and helpful.

However, This week, Nick came to our home to service our pool solar system which had developed a few leaks. As I explained, their employees have already set a very high bar of customer service and satisfaction for us. I am pleased to say that Nick exceeded even that high standard and went above and beyond. He was everything I mentioned, professional, polite, friendly and helpful and technically very proficient, and MORE.

Thank you to Nick and the Sierra Pacific team for taking care of our service needs. We highly recommend them for your needs. Jon & Barbara<//text>

<Text>We been having bad luck w/ our AC system for the past years.  First, when we bought our new house, the AC unit that was built from the builder was too small and weak, which lasted for about 8 yrs. Then we upgrade a little bigger from an AC tech. guy, and that lasted only 5 yrs. One day, we pass by Costco and see that they also provide AC services.  Sierra Pacific Solar, Heating & Air Service is affiliated w/ Costco at the time. Overall, Costco is very picky of who they connect or associate with bc of their brand name is on the line.  Thus, I give it shot and try them.  In short, from the beginning process to the end, all the workers from Sierra Pacific, ranging from the secretary, design specialist (Joji/John), installers (Anthony, Aurelio, & Michael Montana), and everyone else were absolutely fantastic.  All positive and nothing to complain about. I really appreciate and hands down to all the installers, who were working on my house all day installing new and complete AC and Heating System in 100 degrees weather...working non-stop diligently for 2 days straight. The AC is working great. Finally, my family and I get to experience a true AC feeling from now on. Worth the money and necessary for my family health.  Strongly recommend Sierra Pacific to anyone.

<Text>Andy is the best service tech ever. Very skilled, professional, and cordial. He more than makes up for the trainwreck tech I waited all day for the previous day.  No show and no call after I confirmed with scheduler that he was still coming after he was late for my 4 hour time slot. Very uncool.< /Text><Name>khash5<//Name>< Gmap_id>

Did what I had asked for in a punctual, friendly and professional way.  David, the technician was very nice and I feel he is trustworthy and I'd be glad to have him back.
The only reason why I gave only 4 stars is that they came out to check everything and that is what I paid for.  But then the charge for replacing the capacitor was an additional $289.00 (Amazon: $8.09);  $80 I wouldn't have said anything - but I know from experience, they all overcharge on those items.  Kind of a downer.</Text>

In regards to the parts, I will share that the price to provide those are a combination of the price the distributor charges (which has inventory and handling costs), plus tax and shipping which we have to pay. Plus we inventory many parts on our trucks so that you can get the repair done in a rapid fashion, which has a carrying cost. More important and more substantial than the cost of the part is the cost of training a Service Professional. In addition to the investments we make to constantly train our team in technical skills, we expect high level of service so that you receive people in your home that you find to be trustworthy, friendly, and who will treat you and your home with respect. To deliver high level of service on all these things is important to our clients, so we invest to make sure that you get this experience and have friendly technicians that you will like and trust to do work with great craftsmanship. Our clients like you expect great results, we are proud that we deliver and I hope that explains our service for you.\nThank you for being our client!\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}<//response><gmapID>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9<//gmapID></record>

<Text>We had Sierra Pacific install our home electric and pool solar and we also have a maintenance agreement with them.   We are very pleased with their service these last few years.  Today Nicholas K. came to service our HVAC system and he was the nicest man.  He put on shoe covers and a mask and took time to explain everything to us in a way that was easy for us to understand.  He was so thorough and helpful about our options for either replacement of some parts or to purchase a new system.  There was absolutely no pressure to buy a new system.  We were extremely impressed with not only his professionalism and expertise but he was truly a great guy to talk to.  We would definitely recommend Sierra Pacific and we want to commend their employee Nicholas K.

UPDATE!!  With the excellent help of Don the design consultant, we decided to go with a new system.  We are so happy with Sierra Pacific and the way our new HVAC system is working. We bought the XC20 and you absolutely do not hear this system! It just works silently in the background. No more jumping up and down to go to the thermostat to adjust it. No more warm and cold spots in the house. No more noise waking you up at night as the AC cycles on. It works with Alexa as well as other platforms. You can adjust the temperature on your phone and your computer. IT JUST WORKS PERFECTLY! And the outside unit is quiet as well. We didn't even know it was on until we walked up right near it. Gabriel and Matt were our installers and they did a magnificent job and kept the house totally clean throughout the process. Gabriel was back the second day and he was a great guy and a very hard worker. I can't imagine what it must have been like to work in an attic on a 100 degree day, but he always gave us a smile when he came down from the attic. We just want to thank Sierra Pacific and all of their wonderful employees who take care of our house solar, pool solar and now our brand new wonderful HVAC system.</Text><response>{'time': 1595278995049, 'text': "Barbara, thank you for the great description of what it is like to be a client of Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort.

<Review>We so appreciate that kind of integrity and highly recommend them. The main reason we chose Sierra Pacific is because that would only mean one company on our roof doing both of our pool water solar and our whole house electric PV systems and would avoid any challenge with two different companies and therefore if anything ever went wrong then one company might blame the other.

Having only one company on our roof to do all of our systems we believe was a great choice

They have responded to every problem professionally and promptly. About two years ago we had a short in one of our PV panels and it took a couple of days to find the problem since we have 60 panels. They replaced the inverter and also replaced the burned-out panel. Our new inverter has now developed a rare problem and they are replacing it for us under its warranty.

Our technician was Eric Wirth. What a great guy and very quickly found the problem. Anyone that has him to their home during these crazy times will be as pleased as we are.

<text>Gabriel and Matt installed our new HVAC system. I cannot say enough good things about these two gentlemen. They are a good team and did their work very efficiently. Both were very personable, timely, and cleaned up as work progressed to keep the mess to a minimum.  On a warm day our attic is miserably hot where HVAC is located, but they just kept moving and working. They did a very nice job and everything was as clean as when they arrived. Gabriel went over the controls and helped to connect to phone and internet making the system operation very easy to learn. The final inspection passed with no issues and I think in part due to Sierra Pacific's good reputation which gave me some comfort that I chosen the right team.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
So I need to have some tubing replaced on the roof's pool solar because of the pesty squirrels and Sierra Pacific now wants to charge me $198 just to drive to my house and take a look. If they find leaks, and they will, that is why I need them to come out, they want to then charge me another $89 for up to 5 leaks.  What a rip off.  Travel and gas do not cost that much.  Had service done 5 years ago and I do expect an increase in price but double the price that is r
Time to find another service.< /Review>

There is not a training school to hire from, every solar pool technician is 100% trained by our experienced managers. Which means that we employ someone to earn a full time paycheck for months before they are actually performing the work. As such there is a high cost to train and keep the experts that our clients really like and trust. I'm proud of the friendly and honest character of our team and it takes a tremendous investment in them for our company to be able to serve our clients with the high standards we are known for. I do hope we get an opportunity serve you again.\nRespectfully,\nJason Hanson\nPresident"}<//resp>< GmapID>

Sierra Pacific HVAC install has been a 5 star experience for us. Highly qualified technicians who go the extra mile to please their customers. Paul K. came to our home for the final install of a custom return air grill and did a superb job.

This is Kate Sommer, , Eric Wirth & Justin Borino fixed my house solar. This was a particularly difficult jobs since Sierra Pacific was not the company that installed my house solar. They were able to find the problem rather quickly I will work with no other company in the future except for Sierra Pacific each dealings I've had with Sierra Pacific have been professional knowledgeable and they've always fixed the problem. This is a great company , and Eric and Justin we're incredibly professional, knowledgeable and so friendly to deal with.</Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>We went through Costco and they paired us with Sierra Pacific. We had received a bid with another HVAC company prior to contracting with SP that was less $$ but we did not feel confident in what we were hearing from them.

The rep from SP, Tony, that showed up to do the initial quote was great. In fact we could very well have paid more because of his empathy, explanation and overall professionalism. We are good with that. Everything was explained extremely well and their were no surprises.

Tad came out to do our site inspection. He was a salty good ole boy! I appreciated his sincerity and honesty. He spent a lot of time taking a look at things then followed up with a confirmation of work to be performed.

Installation day came about a week to 10 days after we signed. Three guys showed up on Friday. Kevin, Nick & Carlos. They all were very kind and introduced themselves as soon as they got there. They worked all day Friday tearing out the old system and placing the new equipment. Saturday just Nick and Kevin returned I had the opportunity to chat with them while they worked, I had fun being the nosy home owner. These guys were great down to earth people.

There were a couple of snags during the install that were 100% fine. 1.) Light in our master bedroom closet was broken by their ladder. Kevin mentioned they would replace it. That has not happened yet, installation was four days ago so no surprise there. 2.) After the crew was done and gone I fired up the system to check airflow and figured out they had the zoning backwards. When I turned on the downstairs thermostat the upstairs air came on and vise versa. I called the installers and Nick, who was already home said he was coming back and would be here in 15 minutes. He was and it was fixed in five minutes. THIS IS WHERE SIERRA PACIFIC REALLY SHINED. It is understandable to make a mistake but the fact that Nick made it right so fast was amazing. Great job Nick, I really appreciate your efforts.

We have not yet had to use the system because, of course, right after install the weather is beautiful! We will and I am sure it will be great.

Give these guys a look. It is my opinion that they do cost more but you get what you pay for. I would do it all again.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1590102144746, 'text': 'Will, thank you very much for the excellent description of the quality of our people.

Michael R. was great! He did a Seasonal Pool Solar Shutdown, and replaced a leaking panel because of a leaking header. Michael R. was friendly and knowledgeable. Most of the Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort employees have been friendly and really good, but I think Michael R. is my new favorite. If he exclusively serviced my pool equipment from now on...I would be a happy camper!  Rex<//text>

From the Design Specialist to the installation of my new HVAC unit, this company lives up to it's  excellent reputation. The installation crew Nick and Kevin were very professional and so friendly. They explained what they would be doing throughout the process and at the end went through the operation and setup of the wifi. They cleaned everything up and I couldn't  be happier with these guys. True excellence.<//Text>

I had a problem with starting my solar system on my pool. I called and was told I couldn't get service for about two weeks. Then I was told I would have to pay a travel charge because I was in Manteca. Turns out that I couldn't get service for about two weeks because that was the day they had for scheduling people in this area. So why was all the people serviced May 6th in our area charged a travel fe
e as if they were the only one being service out here. They should have taken the 5+ customers they serviced out here and spread out the travel charge instead of gouging all of us for a separate fee. Bad business if you ask me.< /Review>

David Munos did a terrific job of explaining how it all works, filter options etc and his conduct rates 5 stars.   We will not sign up for their continuing maintenance as the appointment booking process requires reserving a full day. We would if they booked 3-4 hour windows. Unbelievable lack of customer centric attitude.<//review>

<Text>We are  long time customers of Sierra Pacific and our experiences with both field personnel and customer service has been exceptional.  It is a well run and professional organization that has provided quality products that they stand behind and maintenance and service that are timely and effective for any problems we have had with pool solar, solar power panels, and AC service.  There may be other companies that seem less expensive for equipment purchase and/or service contracts. The value of Sierra Pacific is evident when problems get resolved in such a timely manner to keep our home comfortable and everything running smoothly.

Update 5.19.19 - Carey came out to start up our solar pool heating system.  Very professional and knowledgeable.  He offered some suggestions about system settings if we needed to modify them on our own.

Update 6.10.20  David T. came to fix a leak in the panels and provided valuable (money saving) ideas about how the system could be programmed to work more efficiently and provided some information about supplemental heating options for Spring and Autumn.  He explains the functions of the systems in understandable language.  A great experience with a problem solved as well.<//Text>< rate>

Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort did a great job in installing a new HVAC Lennox system in our home. I would recommend Sierra Pacific as they are honest and price is fair and not overpriced. Sierra Pacific workers are courteous and respectful. During COVID 19 they all wore mask and shoe coverings and cleaned up after themselves and surprised me to see then even go further to wipe everything down with Clorox. Great team. Thanks again to Brad Greenwell, Matt Hamilton, Matt Troske, and Mike Montana.< /text>

Had a whole house ductless heat pump system installed by Sierra Pacific. From start to finish this has been a great experience. The design and estimate was clearly explained. The scheduling was spot on. The crew was on time, kind, considerate, and hard working. They kept everything clean and neat. Everything is perfect. I can control heating and cooling in each room. All from my iPhone!  The system is so quiet!  And it lowers my home Greenhouse Gas emissions significantly! No more gas furnace.< /text>

Sierra Pacific has a serious problem with their customer service. I have the yearly maintenance service and am very disappointed. They always give a 4 to 5 hour window when a technician will arrive and we always seem to be the very last appointment of the day, but end up wasting time waiting for service. This time we were stood up twice, even after we were promised they would be there for service the second day after missing our appointment the day before. We had a scheduled appointment last week, after waiting 4 hours with no phone call we called the customer service department and we’re told they were behind and wouldn’t be able to make the appointment. We were re-scheduled to the next day and promised a technician would be there. Once again, no call, no show. We called the service department after waiting another 3 1/2 hours only to find the service department was closed. Needless to say, we are canceling our service. Do Not Use, they don’t care about their customers!<//Text>

Thomas from Sierra Pacific came out and provided bids for taking our solar down for roof repair.  It is my experience that most companies don't have a clue what customer service really is let alone excellent customer service, but I can most certainly tell you Thomas exceeded all levels in providing excellent customer service!  He was polite, knowledgeable, extremely helpful and just pleasure to conduct business with. It was good news to find out he is returning today to perform the solar removal! Thank you Thomas!< /Text>

We have had our pool's solar system serviced by Sierra Pacific for years.  From the folks in the office to the techs in the big red trucks, the employees are always personable and professional.  We appreciate the extra steps to remind us of our appointments, and the calls to let us know the tech on his way.  Plus they provide great winter/summer service and repairs as needed. Highly recommend.</Review>

<Review>I wish the office had contacted me when the techs were on their way as promised (to make sure I was home and available)--but communication has been an issue in the past between the office, techs and customer. (Half a star deducted.)

But once Mike and David showed up, they were great! Mike checked the actuator on the solar set-up while David fearlessly climbed to the roof to check and restore a disrupted connection with the control box.

Turns out the 5-year-old actuator had a bad plastic O-ring. Once it cracked, it put a strain on the motor, which eventually burned out. Upon checking the price list, Mike found out the actuator replacement had been lowered from $695 to $465 (expensive for an O-ring, lol), but a big savings. And he added a discount on top of it if I had the repair done today rather than having to come back out in the spring, so Mike saved me over $200 which was sorely needed and greatly appreciated! (Half-star added back.)

(My main beef is with the actuator manufacturer, ComPool, for their measly, we-have-no-faith-in-our-product 3-year warranty. Every American car, truck and SUV comes with the same length, and vehicles are a lot more complex than a tiny actuator!! No stars for them.)

What made a big difference to me is that Mike wasn't a corporate robot or a rigid "here's our policy, screw you" type. He was genuine, personable, and sympathized with the customer--and THAT is something sorely lacking these days and is one of the reasons I have stayed with Sierra Pacific for this long. More techs like Mike (and David) are very appreciated!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1571070701260, 'text': 'Hi Mike, thank you for the great review.

Estimator listened carefully to my objective. Correctly recommended a sturdy in-line pump on the domestic water heater supply.  I had doubts about some inexpensive (read - cheap) on-demand circulator at the point of use. Good advise folks ... coming from a licensed P.E.< /Review>

My furnace (Bryant Evolution 90i) was overheating and the local company I had used in the past was unable to address the issue.  I had worked with Sierra Pacific previously on a pool solar heating project and decided to call them regarding my furnace issue.  What a great experience that turned out to be!  The HVAC Tech, Kevin, quickly determined that the issue was due to an improperly sized and constructed duct system.

A follow-up meeting with Hunter, an HVAC Engineer resulted in a thorough  examination of my system and identification of the necessary changes.  I then received a quote from Hunter to perform the duct work upgrade and scheduled a date to have the work completed.

Two technicians (Gabrial Santibanez and Matt Troske) were assigned to my job and were able to complete all the necessary work in one day!  What an amazing difference in the way my system performs!  The system now moves much more air throughout the house and consequently requires less energy to meet our heating demands.

What a great experience it was to work with highly trained and skilled technicians that were customer focused and very professional at performing their jobs!<//review>

Stay clear of this business Sierra pacific  they are contractors for ygrene Energy fund there is a class action suit against ygrene .Sierra pacific works closely with them it’s away for  Sierra Pacific could get your business without you paying the bill upfront. this is a pace loan they pass themselves off as a clean energy that’s how they’re able to get your business .there are many disadvantages of that form of paying they will tell you there is no risk To you in fact that is incorrect .how are you pay is Through your property taxes so if you’re paying $1500 a year you will now be paying nearly 4K a year for 15 years most of that is interest you’ll end up paying nearly $25,000 for a heating and air system The equipment that there are installing is very low quality Lennox Equipment see consumer affairs they have a F rating and many complaints also the class action suit is called Smith versus ygrene Energy Fund I have joined that class action suit and get periodically updated if you have any questions regarding that suit contact in Northern California District Court San Francisco  speak to a clerk they will direct you to the attorney representing Jason Hanson is the president of Sierra Pacific he is not to be trusted he will lie to you to get your business his employees are not very knowledgeable in heating and air very high turnover I’ve had nothing but problems with this heating and air system that is in my house now there is a separate case being assembled just for Sierra Pacific as we speak thank you<//review>

Long story short.
Had both solar and pool installed in 2012. Sierra talked us into a beta system at a discount to which we agreed. Jump ahead several years as California had a drought and we received little rain. In 2017 we got a few storms and had a leak develop right under the spot where they had installed the solar electrical. They claimed it was out of warranty and our problem. Fought with them back and forth until finally in 2018 they agreed to do a patch job on the roof, which failed. We had to contract out to a third party in order to repair the roof correctly. Inside our living room, under the damaged area, we now have an unsightly patch on the ceiling. Had Sierra warned us about any issues with our roof before installing, we could have had corrective measures done then. In my opinion, they just wanted the sale. Our roof is now at the point of needing to be replaced and now Sierra is artificially inflating the cost of temporarily removing the system and reinstalling it. The manager of the solar electrical needs to be fired.

In response to owners response: The leak in our roof is centered right under where the electrical solar was placed.

2020 update - we had our roof replaced and a third party solar company did both electric and pool for $3500 where Sierra wanted $9000 just for solar. SP is a bunch of Bastages.<//review>

My experience with Sierra Pacific has been only negative.  Cancelled appointments, showing up very late, leaving tools on the job site.  They gave me a quote on a Whole house fan, then said they couldn't install it, then changed their mind and said they could and raised the price another $1,700.  I had the exact unit installed by someone else for 1/3 the price.  I've scheduled appointments 2-3 months in advance, and they call a week before and cancel, and tell me the next available date is 30 days or more from the first appointment.  They refuse to let me talk with the owner, There is something wrong with this company and the management, I don't trust them.  I would give them 0 stars but you have to give them at least one to post your comments.  What do I like about this business ?  nothing</review>

< Review>
After 3 years of repeated repairs to the tune of $2,100 I decided to seek another company's intervention. Mind you I was told that the system was still in good shape. The last repair was performed after not having a functioning heat side on our heat pump last winter. I was told that the problem was a "bug" which was remedied and I was directed to purchase their silver plan. Not accustomed to having a mechanical bug. Decided to shop around instead. Recently ceased the silver plan and I'm moving on. Service was pleasant just not proficient.</Review>

<Review>Sierra Pacific has great products, great technicians, and great installation.  My only problem with them is their appointment system.   I have made 3 appointments in 2 years for solar service and in each case,  the appointments were lost.  When I called to confirm, they had no record of the appointments, even though they were made by their own technicians.    Their in-house customer service needs  some correction and improvement.<//Review>< userid>

The service technician was knowledgeable, kind, and efficient. He cleaned our unit out in the 103 weather with a smile. He referred me back to the office/original salesman for the issues I am still having since getting the new unit. Just have one room still not cooling down. Will follow up with office on Monday,  they always give great customer service.< /Review>

<text>Every 1 star rated review is typical and ongoing as evidenced, this company sold their own salesman a new furnace at his Lake if the Pines home which used propane, it was not a propane furnace nor retrofitted for propane and it was left to run this way, the furnace was impacted with soot and numerous technicians were sent out attempting to fix the problem by replacing everything on the unit when it needed to be removed, the customer, a Sierra Pacific employee was kept unaware of why his new furnace seemingly was  not repairable , when a company treats its own employees this way you know it is no better for anyone else. Another new install on a heat pump  used the existing line set  from an old GE AC system which was not compatible for heat pump use, the flexible line set  had plastic lining that melted and was sucked into the new condensing unit that was destroyed, Sierra Pacific said it was defective, not admitting their installation error  to their own distributor, that is fraud. There have been "tune ups"   performed on working units that became non working units  and one was so full of propane there was not enough oxygen in the place to explode easily, 10% gas  and 90% air is optimal, they  routinely  have solar  technicians  perform HVAC calls after having a HVAC man who is competent take them on calls for awhile and cut them lose on customers homes. The roof issues were ongoing as now too,  if a roof is not near new  there should probably not be a solar system installed on top of it  which requires making holes in the roof, lots of them!  Installations that were weeks before they learned the equipment was not compatible  nor was the zoning setup  they  sold,  none of it would work together, they even  had "CHARLIE BROWN" look at it and he could not fix it!  No that is not a joke, Lennox had a troubleshooter  with that name,they  then compensated the customer by  upgrading their equipment which  was making it dicey  since the initial install s so incompetent. New installs that were not working for weeks  that had the panel fall off in the attic sucking in 150 F air  and fiberglass dust into the unit and home.
By now you might have surmised I was employed by Sierra Pacific  and yes I was, this is how I know the things I assert here, I did not work  there very long either. Their dispatcher rode with me on a call to Shingle springs  he day  to see a collection of cars he had been told of, I fixed the hydronic system that numerous techs failed  and we went back  to  the shop, weeks later I get called in by the manager Mike  alleging a report was made alleging a Sierra Pacific van was on the freeway involved in a road rage incident where the Sierra Pacific van driver threw a bottle  out his drivers window at a car  to his right getting off the freeway  and in the exit lanes  about 40 feet away and allegedly  bashe the windshield  and gave  an elderly  woman  sitting in the back of the car an angina episode.
The manager  and the dispatcher  both had me in Mike's office  and they  said they had both reviewed the time sheets  and I was the only  technician working that day  at that time in that area  and the Highway Patrol was asking them about it, I was surprised they  said it had to be me  cause  this never happened  and did not  really sound plausible  , but the Highway patrol  was involved  so that worried me, I racked my brain  trying to figure out what day it was that I was in the area and when they  showed me  I realized it was the day  the dispatcher rode with me to  Shingle springs!!!!  I pointed this out  and Mike was saying what time was the dispatcher clocked out , it was after the alleged incident!  meaning he was with me! I had it there but was more I can't fit, they fired me for staying at a motel and cheated me out of EDD by lying ,saying I lived in the van!!
This rating is not fake,  Employees past  & inexperienced are associated with their C20 license. They defrauded Lennox, cheated me and sales man Ken Baxter who bought a new furnace, they won't ever admit to it, ask Ken!< /text><user>109940784446308982981</user><Date>1582968321144< /Date></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Absolutely the best and most comprehensive service we have ever received since singing on board with Sierra. I  feel as if he truly wanted to assist us and fix the problem. He went out of his way to test the pump, the water flow, heat transfer, etc. All of which no one else has done previously. Upon completion we had a discussion concerning his findings and he asked that I clean the filter system again and then call to see if the solar is heating the water more efficiently. Very positive experience. Will definitely recommend Sierra for this service.</Review>< Resp>

<review>Wow!  I want to thank Jason Hansen (the owner of Sierra Pacific Home and Comfort) and his team!  I just got off the phone with him regarding a concern I had (he spent 30 min with me on the phone I never felt like I was being rushed to end the call or that he had other matters to attend to.  He made me feel that my Family and I were the most important concern and that he needed to address our concerns!) Unfortunately there was a miscommunication but Jason went above and beyond my expectations.  He personally reached out to me.  I have never had the owner of a company be so easily available to its customers.  This re-assured me of the original decision and reason why I selected to go with Sierra Pacific!  Their reputation and believe in customer satisfaction is unmatched!  I am a Life Long customer because of this and will continue to do business with them on future projects and refer them to Friends and Family.  Any company can say they believe in their products and services but Sierra Pacific lives it, stands by it and makes it a reality! The company is extremely experienced and Jason truly believes in his company and his employees!  Make the right choice!

The customer service has deteriorated over the years. Have bought 2 solar systems for my pool from them over the years. The second one never worked right and developed constant leaks. They changed every panel at least once. Didn't tell me that there was a recall and they should have replaced them all at once instead of one at a time as they failed. Now the warranty is up and they charge me $150 a trip to fix the constant leaks. Plus they make me wait at least a month for service even though I had a "preferred" customer contract. Just cancelled the contract and will just do without solar on the pool for awhile. Not worth having when it is inoperable most of the time.<//Text>

Let me assure you that Sierra Pacific works diligently to serve our clients with technicians that are well trained, honest, and ones that you will like to have at your home. While we do not have control over the manufacturing process, we are excellent at our installation and service. We are constantly recruiting for new staff that we trust to have the good character and customer service skills to serve our clients. There is not a trade school that teaches Solar Pool Heating Panel service - Sierra Pacific must train each Service Professional individually to be qualified to perform safe roof top solar pool panel service. As a result, there is a limited supply of Solar Pool Service staff to perform Start-ups, Winterization shut-downs, and respond to service repairs – but the ones you get from Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort are second to none. Our service fees are based on the necessary practices for our team to train, work, and operate safely in the State of California. To provide a custom trained service technician in a fully stocked truck to get to your home to perform a safe roof top repair is a specialized service that costs a lot to accomplish. My goal is to help keep your solar pool system operating at peak condition without troubles. I think we can help you here.

Jason,

Well here we go again.......YOU have had another chance again after your response to my review to make it right!
Unfortunately,  Again We DON'T HEAR  a peep from you even though in your response to my review, You try to make it look to your customers that you are more than willing to take care of them.

Anyone reading this must wonder why in the world would you not take care of a customer where YOU HAVE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU PUT HOLES IN THEIR ROOF and you talked them into an upgraded system in where it's costing them more money and you continue to put them off and not install what you were supposed to have done weeks ago.  I'm sure you're aware that we've had many people tell us that legally we should be going after you.
We would never recommend Sierra Pacific!

Below orginal review.

Unfortunately, we could never recommend them!  About 10 plus years ago when we hired them to put our pool solar in they did what we thought at the time a great job. However, after a few years we became aware that some panels were defective and under warranty, they were leaking. We waited for Sierra Pacific to come out and replace those panels which eventually they did,  but unfortunately put holes in our roof during the process.  Sierra Pacific response was our roof was old and needed to be replaced.  Our roof was old but had no issues until they came out and created holes when they were remounting the panels which caused leaks in our roof.  Our roof definitely had a few more years and we were planning on replacing it, but again there were NO LEAKS IN THE ROOF UNTIL THEY CAME OUT TO DO THEIR WORK.   Sierra Pacific acknowledged the holes and said they would give us a discount in remounting these panels after we put on our new roof. Well that obviously didn't cover the damage inside our house and nor did it take care of the problem that this could happen again when they're mounting the panels.  Sierra Pacific talked my husband into upgrading the panels, which obviously they're making more money, and saying that way they can use a different system when installing the new panels.  We had a new roof installed and ordered the upgraded panels that they suggested.  They continue to put us on the back burner when it came to removing the panels and setting up a date to install the new ones.  We have been so gracious by continuing to work with them and upgrading the panels. However, they are the ones that put the holes in the roof, so one would think we would be one of their first priorities, however, they continue to make us wait by scheduling us far out and then a day before the installation they call to reschedule it three more weeks out.
So as you can see this company lacks integrity and putting their customer first.  So obviously we could never recommend them!</review>

Sierra Pacific did not create your problem, the roof was in poor shape from factors not related to any work done by Sierra Pacific, age being a primary factor. It is the reason we recommended for your husband to repair the roof. He was able to see the reason for our recommendations and took action on his own to remedy the roof. We are doing our best to provide you a solar pool heating solution per your request and could not do it on the old roof. By the time we were notified that you were ready for the new solar pool heating collectors, our schedule was already booked out so we are doing our best to serve everyone with new installations in an orderly fashion.\n\nKind Regards,\nJason Hanson\nPresident"}< /Resp>< gmapID>

When we had a problem with our pool system function, I called Sierra Pacific and a technician was scheduled for 2 days later.  I was notified on that day that the technician was on the way.  When Nick arrived we discussed the problems and he understood what needed attention.  He was very thorough and explained what he had done and made sure I knew how to work the system.  We are totally pleased with the service he provided.  We are glad we have the service contract Sierra Pacific.</Review>

But often times our technicians will move through their day faster than expected and that allows us to move people forward. We cannot know at the time of the phone request how long the service call will take so we give a standard window of time and work hard to accomplish faster. When a technician gets on a difficult repair, we are committed to working to get the client repaired and sometimes it takes longer. In an effort not to over-promise to clients, we are careful to schedule so that we can often see people sooner than originally scheduled. Thank you for letting the Sierra Pacific team serve you.

A/C wasnt working at all. when called for service call, they told me to wait for 15 days. what good it is to be , if they can't provide service when it is needed. i am seriously considering not to sign up for an annual service contract.<//Text>< userid>

Our service technician was Chris and he has a great attitude and was very polite.  He was very friendly with our pups who shake down anyone that comes in the house.

We had just purchased this home and Sierra Pacific agreed to inspect the heater, even though it is summer, as well as the A/C, when every other company I called refused.

Chris performed a very thorough inspection of the heating and air conditioning systems.

The cost was very reasonable and the phone service is timely, competent, and polite.<//Review>

The staff was friendly and kind. Kevin was a really cool guy. He explained what happened and I felt he was very  thorough and fixed the issue in a timely manner.  The system works great and I am satisfied.

Ok so I did not use the system for a couple of weeks and when I went to turn it back on it would not blow cool air. Sierra Pacific sent out another guy named Cary Sommers. This guy identified the second issue not found the first time and fixed the issue. My house is nice a cool and I am once again happy. Carey was polite kind and definitely knew his stuff. He explained what was wrong and fixed the system. Carey thanks dude. You did a good job<//Text>

Had a great experience from beginning to end! I live a wooded area and my pool barley hits the 80s before the solar install. I had it to 85 degrees 5 days after the install in mid May! Way worth it, plus they had all the options for payment available on the spot.</Review>

< Review>
I had service on the LG mini-Split Unit heating/AC in my shop. The service was excellent: On time, efficient, and effective. Andy and Kevin worked steadily and happily. My mini-split is more-or-less like new, after serving me for 8 years already.

Since the mini-split service, I have had a high end Lennox HVAC system in stalled by Sierra Pacific, using their program with Costco. The system is good, although after two years, it was necessary to replace first the AC condenser coil and then the compressor. This was unfortunate, since the system was out of warranty for labor. But Sierra Pacific made the repairs promptly, and the service reps were excellent. Joel just finished doing annual maintenance on the AC. All the technicians have been excellent.< /Review>

<date>1565235592441<//date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>We highly recommend Sierra Pacific of Rancho Cordova.  First, our design experience was great.   Our consultant, Bryan, was great.  He was prompt, knowledgeable, and thorough.  We had no questions unanswered when he left.  We completely understood the terms and time frame, and everything we discussed and agreed upon is what we received.  Peter, who measured the windows was also prompt and efficient.  Every window and door installed fit perfectly.  The installation technician completed the work in one day, as promised .  He was careful and precise.  Everything looks perfect. We have had our new windows for a little over 3 months and we are very happy with the windows.  Not only do they look great, they really do make a difference in our home comfort.  We had doubts that we would really notice a difference.  Until one of the hottest weeks in Tracy - our AC unit failed!  The AC technicians had to order a part and we we without an AC for 2 days with100% temperatues.  Our house stayed15 or more degrees cooler than outside.  It doesn't sound like a lot, but trust me, it makes a difference.  We have recommended Sierra Pacific to our coworkwrs and friends.  We will definitely contact them first for any future needs.<//Text>< pictures>

<Time>1567018183279</Time><Rating>1</Rating><review>I wish I had read the reviews before hiring Sierra Pacific to install my pool solar.  They were very proficient at saying the right words regarding customer service with their phone messages, websites, and even commercials, but it all fell apart when it came to action. I tried very hard to get someone to resolve my problems before writing this review but there is absolutely nobody to voice concerns in hopes of a remedy.

Our relationship started off good.  The salesman was knowledgeable and made my wife and I feel good about the purchasing decision.  We even opted in for the monthly service so our system stays in top shape.   I did my part and paid the money but writing the checks was only the easy part.

After the check cashed we had problem after problem.  Our Spa has not worked right after the install.  They sent out a technician and then a "Senior" technician came but the problem they created was beyond each of their skill sets.  As the homeowner, this was not reassuring when you are hiring professionals to do the work.  We had a leak last year and when I called, Sierra Pacific tried every with excuse instead of actually finding and addressing the leak.  They eventually found the leak but it was a painful process.   Painful call after painful call is the pattern in dealing with the company and not to mention another leak at the end of last season.  I left it for the following year as I did not have the strength for another battle since at the end of swim season.  Maybe this is a tactic on their end?

Fast forward to this year.  Being a priority customer it still takes MONTHS to get my solar turned on but this time I also wanted the leak fixed.  Water spraying from my rooftop is not ideal.  The technician ended up coming out a second time after the "turn on" to address this leak and he informs me that the problems I am having is due to a poor install.  I let him know that SIERRA PACIFIC did the install and he says..."Welp, what do I know anyway?"  He says that he saved me $600 by cutting the panel and tying off the leak.  My system is under warranty so why would you cut into my panel and band-aid it if they are defective? Seems like they are not addressing the original issue instead waiting for it to fall out of warranty then hit me with the big bill.

I spoke to Sierra Pacific about the comment from the technician.  I also refused to pay for the $50 service fee until this is resolved so of course they sent a technician right away.  SP does something 'right away'?  Oh that's right, because I owed them money.

The "Senior" technician comes out to the house and finds more possible leaks and shuts off my solar heating to my pool.  WHAT?!?  Why does it get shut off in August without my consent?  I called Sierra Pacific to complain and there is nobody to talk to with authority and no manager will ever call back.  I was then told they will come back and turn my pool on in October.  They turned it off in the summer and will come back out to fix what they reversed two months later?  This entire company is a joke.  How do they stay in business?<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I had an AC Unit that was way undersized for my home (3-Ton) for a 2000 square foot single story home with vaulted ceilings. I had three other estimates done and Sierra Pacific was very competitive.  they were willing to relocate my unit outside away from my bedroom window and put it in a better location.  As an installer myself, I found it comforting to have my installers keep me updated every step of the install. It was a great choice to have Sierra Pacific do my install and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good deal with awesome service.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1526942246210, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing Sierra Pacific!\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}< /Response>< GmapID>

All work done by the install crew was accomplished quickly and cleanly (even though the temperature that day topped 100 outside and had to be hotter in the attic. I am grateful for their courtesy and for the pride they took in completing a tough job in the best of ways.  Thanks to you all!</Text>< Pictures>

So far I’d been happy with Sierra Pacific ever since my replacement units were installed in 2015. Plus, we got a cash card from Costco, so that was a bonus.
About 2 weeks ago, I finally succumbed and turned on the AC when the temps went above 100F. Unfortunately, the vents didn’t seem to be blowing out cool air.
I called on a Tuesday evening, but they weren’t able to be me scheduled till the following Tuesday. So, I deducted 1/2 star for that. Thankfully, it wasn’t too crazy hot the next 3 days, but the weekend was in the mid-upper 90s. Thank goodness for table fans.
Then they finally came in to fix, Phillip, the technician, discovered exactly what was wrong right away. Unfortunately, what was wrong was a mistake he believes was made during the original install 3 years ago. He appologized and got to work as soon as he let the office know the situation and ended up working for a good 4 hours.
You might ask why such a high rating considering the original botched job. It was because Phillip was very thorough, very diligent and very professional. I could tell he took his job very seriously. There was another issue he discovered as well, but because it wasn’t one of the things they replaced in 2015, it was not part of the warranty and I had to pay for it. I was fine with that. All things considered, the damage could have been a lot worse.
Today, temps got above 100F again, but I can feel nice cold air blowing.< /review>

I moved into my home almost three years ago and have never had my solar pool panels checked out. After meeting with Sierra Pacific about my HVAC system, the representative recommended that I have these panels inspected before the swimming season kicks in.

Chris, from Sierra Pacific showed up today and performed a thorough inspection of my system. Fortunately, my 15 year old panels still work and do not leak. However, he DID discover a significant leak in a pvc pipe joint which he repaired while here. The work was thorough and Chris could not possibly been more polite or professional in all aspects. It was a pleasure having him at my home.</text>

Every person I spoke with was friendly and customer-service oriented.  I got the feeling they were working for me.  BUT, it took a week to get my hot water heater fixed and no one EVER called me to tell me the status of my repair project or what it was going to cost.  I always had to call the office and wait at least 15 minutes on hold before speaking to someone to voice my frustration.  If they can get their back office up to speed and actually communicate, my rating would be higher because the techs were great and just repaired what needed to be repaired without trying to upsell me.<//review>

After being in contract for replacement HVAC, they determined that they had to go through drywall for access. They wanted to charge me $7,000 to replace two 5x4 sections of drywall, tape and texture and paint.  I decided to go with a different contracor, whose price was $8,000 less than SP quoted, and I am getting the drywall work done for several hundred dollars, which is a fraction of what SP was going to charge.<//Review><date>1592500006514<//date><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<Time>1443841270923<//Time><rating>5</rating><review>We just had Sierra Pacific install a solar heater for the pool.  It was a great experience all around.  I got a ballpark estimate from the salesman about 9 months ago and told him I didn't want to be bugged with phone calls because I needed the time to save the money.  He kept his word and I didn't hear from him again until I initiated contact.  He was timely for our appointment, thorough in his explanation yet to the point so the appointment didn't take up my whole morning.  The day of installation, the crew was here when they said they would be and they finished within the time frame they said.  When they left, everything was as clean as it was before the install.  The gentleman who showed us the operations of the system was hugely patient as I walked in right at the end of his "lesson" and he repeated the whole thing to me!  All and all, an excellent experience and now I have a nice warm pool.  Doesn't get any better than that!!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I had Sierra Pacific home and Comfort in Rancho Cordova service an air conditioning unit which worked fine at the time. The servicing of this second unit was part of the contract when I had them replace a main unit. They forgot to service this second unit at the time  and came out in November,  11 months later, to service this second unit . They found a capacitor that was slightly weak, charged $200 to replace the capacitor. After their sevicing, the first time the heater attempted to turn on it would not come on. I called Sierra Pacific to come back out, they want another $700 plus dollars to do a repair.
Their service man was very polite, but as a consumer when these things happen we sometimes scratch our head and ask why did it work fine before the service and not after.< /text>

<time>1557375641646</time><text>Responding to the string below started by Crystal and Jason (partial is below)

Jason, let's be sure we get the fact straight on this...

1.  After the initial installation years ago, we had no issues with any roof leaks and the roof still had at least 20 years left on it.
2.  Our roof developed leaks ONLY AFTER after your team came back on a warranty call to replace some leaking panels.
3.  When your Tech and I viewed the damage from within the attic space, we were both shocked to see the gaping hole at one of the strap attachment points - he took pictures.  From the top, the opening in the shingles was so large I could have put my fist through it.  Worse, the damage was done near the top of the panels at the header, literally stopping the flow of rain water from higher up on the roof at the header, only to allow a free flow of water into my attic space in large quantities.  The LEAST that could have been done at that time is that the warranty techs could have alerted me to the damage they created so I could have repaired it before it rained - yet for some reason they chose to stay silent.. resulting in water damage to the inside of our home.  THIS IS A SERIOUS INTEGRITY ISSUE!
4.  Thereafter, I sent a video to your Service Manager showing the literal water fall that was occurring over a window on the inside of my bedroom, directly beneath the area described above.
5.  We have been very gracious and patient with your company and have not escalated the matter (a path that could have easily been taken given all the facts and physical evidence).  We have never asked for compensation for the internal damages caused by your work.  We have only asked for you to be fair and reasonable with the charges for removal of the old panels and installation of the new panels.
6.  As a result of the damages caused by your company we opted to replace the roof (doing only this section would have looked stupid).
7.  As far as scheduling... in Feb/March we scheduled the panel removal, which occurred on 4/10/19.  In March we scheduled reinstall of new panels for May 2 (some 6+ weeks after it was scheduled).  We are still not sure how or why the new panels were not in your shop ready for the May 2 schedule date.... again we have been very gracious and patient under the circumstances and have not received like treatment from your company... very disappointing and concerning as Crystal indicated in her review.

Maybe its time you called me to work this out before this mole hill becomes a mountain.

Mark

Jason,

Well here we go again.......YOU have had another chance again after your response to my review to make it right!
Unfortunately,  Again We DON'T HEAR  a peep from you even though in your response to my review, You try to make it look to your customers that you are more than willing to take care of them.

Anyone reading this must wonder why in the world would you not take care of a customer where YOU HAVE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU PUT HOLES IN THEIR ROOF and you talked them into an upgraded system in where it's costing them more money and you continue to put them off and not install what you were supposed to have done weeks ago.  I'm sure you're aware that we've had many people tell us that legally we should be going after you.
We would never recommend Sierra Pacific!

Below original review.

Unfortunately, we could never recommend them!  About 10 plus years ago when we hired them to put our pool solar in they did what we thought at the time a great job. However, after a few years we became aware that some panels were defective and under warranty, they were leaking. We waited for Sierra Pacific to come out and replace those panels which eventually they did,  but unfortunately put holes in our roof during the process.  Sierra Pacific response was our roof was old and needed to be replaced.  Our roof was old but had no issues until they came out and created holes when they were remounting the panels which caused leaks in our roof.<//text><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

If you like going to Costco they have good products but the air-conditioning service from Lennox that they offer you is not a company to trust ! Avoid Sierra Pacific ! They we’re glad to take my money and  install two air-conditioners at my duplex for $16,000  and give me a 10 year warranty  but when it breaks they give you a 15 day WAIT date of repair which is ridiculous in hot summer !!!  I had to put my tenants in my own house !   I contacted them back and complained and said one of their managers would call me back which they never did again no trust issue with this company !  I contacted  it’s major competitors and they all said their company would never do that  and would give me 1 to 2 day service  so go to another company if you want good service  if you plan on purchasing units like I did .  Every other company considers you top priority if you purchase air-conditioners !<//review>

We used the Costco program to purchase a new HVAC unit.  Sales rep offered several options while allowing us to customize our request.  We mentioned that one room was significantly cooler or warmer (depending on the season) than the rest of the house.  He said they might need to change the size of the duct work or add a second air feed to the room.

Today (2/3/16), I made my seventh service call since the installation date of early November 2015.  Problems began when the original crew was pulled from job before it was finished.  Second crew knew nothing of the special needs of the one room.  Third, fourth and fifth crews have diagnosed different problems while adding larger ducts, a second duct, a return air vent, and relocation of the thermostat.  After conversations with these crew leaders, installation and service managers, and finally a VP, we have a room that is a wonderful 55 degrees on this chilly morning.  It is only 15 degrees cooler than the rest of the house.  There is more HOT air in the word of management than is in the room.  Run away from this provider unless you want to wait around for service calls for months at a time.</Review>

Sierra Pacific completed a fairly technical energy upgrade on my 24 year old house.  The design was challenging, but the salesman and installation crew were technical and very professional.  They focused on a clean install and I was impressed all the way around - an outstanding and quality job was performed at each step: design, rough-in, install, and startup.

The job included replacing two large older tank water heaters with tankless models, installing three new systems in bedrooms, replacing the furnace and relocating the AC compressor to the far side of the house.  To make the project more interesting, the house is built into a hill and the bedrooms downstairs had no heat nor ducting;  Sierra Pacific installed very efficient wall units in two rooms and a small mini split to serve two rooms.  We were able to move in and with heat in the bedrooms!

The final phase was the energy testing for possible PGE rebates.  The testing company was very impressed with the leak reduction of 20%. Approximately 10% of the leak reduction was attributed to the HVAC work and 10% to the new French doors (not installed by Sierra Pacific).  The energy testing team demonstrated the same level of professionalism as Sierra Pacific.

I wish all of the workers who contributed to the house redo were of the same caliber as the SP guys in the shiny red trucks.  I chose them for the quality of the service department and I wanted to know the install company would stand by their work for years.  I have no regrets with using Sierra Pacific.  Again the install team was amazing (Nick, Kevin, and Alejandro I think).</Text>

Their technician (Anthony M.)  completed a Solar Pool Tune-up at the discounted cost, as advertised; technician was thorough, friendly and knowledgeable.  We've used Sierra Pacific for our pool solar at our previous house, and would definitely recommend their services.<//Text>

< review>
My wife and I had the very best experience from first contact through installation of the top of the line matched equipment. Everybody has been respectful and forthcoming. Every question I could think of was answered. Answers to questions I hadn't thought of were also presented. I had five different companies in my home providing quotes for multiple line of products. I chose Sierra Pacific to provide me with a complete system and reduct. The installation exceeded Title 24 requirements and the most recent building code regulations. The system is new and we have been pleased thus far. The new system is extremely quiet as well as efficient and will save me money compared to the system that was installed when the house was built in 2002. I can't make a stronger recommendation than Sierra Pacific. If you are looking for HVAC services, look no further.</review>

We have been long time customers of Sierra Pacific and couldn't be happier with the service they provide both for our solar as well as our  heating and air conditioning. They always go above and beyond what is expected and that is why we're so loyal to them.< /Review>

We purchased a brand new HVAC unit and duct work through Sierra Pacific.  Installed 7/2015.  Service and work was fair, despite a worker falling through my hallway ceiling and then needing that to be repaired.  But Sierra Pacific handled everything and did a good job.  Fast forward 3 yrs later everything was working great, until one day among our 100 degree days in Sacramento our A/C stopped working.  We called Sierra Pacific to come check it out because we are still under warranty for our new unit.  Technician Carey came out, he was very nice, but had to take our whole unit apart to find out 2 copper wires internally were sitting on each other, which eroded a hole in one of the lines.  This hole resulted in a loss of Freon and our unit to not work.  Carey was very nice and showed us the issue.  He stated he had never seen anything like this before.  I asked if there was anything that could have been done to prevent this, his response - "no".  I requested to have a supervisor to call me, which I expected the next day.  I reached out the following day and left a message fro the Service Manager, Tricia.....NO call back.  So the next day, Thursday I called again and spoke with Desiree this time.  I asked if there was an update for my repairs, she responded no.  I let her know the situation and that i had already left a message for Tricia, but have not received a call back.  It is now Friday morning, 3 days since a service technician came out and found the problem.  BUT no movement on my repairs, no update from a supervisor OR anyone in the company for that matter. I have filed a complaint with Lennox.  The temps have been n the 80's the last few days, but going back up to 100 this weekend.  My family with 2 young children and an elderly dog have NO A/C despite still paying a $13,000 bill for brand new unit 3 yrs that Sierra Pacific would like me to pay another $921 for the labor on a faulty unit.  Does this sound like a company.  I am not seeing or feeling any of their guarantees of great service and products currently!!  - Very unhappy customers</text>

Technician David came to my house today because my air conditioniting wasn't working.  It didn't take him long to find out what was going on.  He asked to see my previous readings in order to compare them to the present ones.  That made me feel comfortable that these readings are legitimate.

He explained every detail to me.  This is a guy that any company would be proud to employ.  His heart is in his work.

I am going to make an effort to brag about Sierra Pacific to my neighbors and friends and hopefully get them to transfer their accounts over to you.

Thank you for the prompt and efficient service.

Sincerely,

Patricia Croft< /Text>

So the technician was held up on his call just prior to mine.  These things do happen and it caused quite the delay in his expected arrival time. However, the office team was keeping me informed the whole time so I could adjust my schedule accordingly. So no problem there. Andy, the tech was extremely knowledgeable, professional and courteous. Most importantly he had a great attitude. Oh and he fixed the problem!  I highly recommend Sierra Pacific for any HVAC needs.  Oh, and one thing more, I have just retired from 50 years in the construction industry. So I've seen a thing or two regarding HVAC Contractors.</Review>

Just finished week six post install.  My meter has gone from 04116 to 03943.  That’s a run back of 173 kWh. PGE bill was $8.10.  Did all of this with just 15 Panasonic panels installed for a 2,700 sq ft house.  And, that was with cabinet guys, landscape guys, and painters running thru my my house/yard the entire time running their jack hammers, air compressors, and power tools.  Am I happy with Sierra Pacific?  You bet.</Text>

My annual service was delayed two months.  Then the technitian came out for 15 minutes, said looks great might need a part next year and left.  I left my house as well.  Came home later that day to a 90 degree house with no A/C working.  Went out to the compressor and the coils were still dirty and the leaves were still in the bottom of the unit.  I called service and they did send another Tech out at 7pm.  He was great and fixed everything, and cleaned the unit.< /text>

They showed up on time and the solar system is working fine.  There was a problem with the installation but Sierra took care of it in a professional manner.   Problems happen and the quality of the installer is proven by the way they respond.  The only area where they fell a little short, was that I expected to be able to monitor the performance (salesman said so) of each panel on their web application but they only allow access to summary performance data.  Seems to be a change in policy as my neighbor who bought from them a few months earlier, got full access.  They really should allow customers full access to the solaredge app.< /Review>

Kris crawled in my attic to check out the equipment I have currently, and provided me a written estimate.

Fast forward a week, and my bathroom ceiling has caved in. I went up in the attic and found 2 broken condensation lines pouring water into my ceiling! The lines were directly in the path that Kris took to the equipment, and noone has been in my attic before or since (I've owned this house for 4 months, and nobody has been up there since I bought it).

I called Kris, and he denied that he did anything, but offered to have someone come out the next day to repair the broken lines. I got a call from Jason Hansen (the owner) and he (in a very unprofessional tone) told me that they are not responsible, and quickly ended the phone call.

At no point did Kris or Jason even offer to come inspect the damage before they blanketly denied any responsibility.  Do not do business with these people, not even for a competing bid. They do not take responsibility for their actions. They don't even make an effort to do so.< /Text><date>1530828917327< /date></record>

The 2 previous technicians had a switch in the wrong setting. Now its July, and after 3 appointments finally my very expensive solar system is actually working. Thanks to Dave! A suggestion, either have Dave train your other techs on the timer panel and system components, or have a sync between what your installers are installing and what your technicians are trained in servicing.< /text>

I am a long time customer of Sierra Pacific and late last year I had a full replacement completed on AC and heating unit for my home. I am writing this letter to state how well your staff installed and instructed me on the use of my new system.  I am very satisfied with my system and I can see my energy bill has decreased dramatically especially for AC.  You have installed both my pool solar and now my HVAC and I am impressed your company and staff.  The only thing they missed was the fact that they had to pour a slab for the unit which they did after I mentioned that was part of the quote.  Also, the unit completely broke down once but was quickly fixed under warranty.<//review>

Marc, the technician with Sierra Pacific, came  on 4/11/2015 to start the solar heating system for our home swimming pool.  We found him to be friendly and personable, as well as knowledgeable and competent.  He was patient in answering questions.  He went out of his way to provide excellent service.< /text>

We are on our third leak now. All I care about is my 2 kids with disabilities that would like to use the pool and not have it cold.

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I normally don't write reviews but took the time to enthusiastically recommend Sierra Pacific (SP).  I had a problem with my solar pool panels installed by SP and manufactured by Fafco as they frequently sprang leaks.  The panels have a 12 year warranty  and are expensive.  The panels occasionally do spring a leak but only a few times a year.  Mine were springing leaks every month.  When I last checked with SP, Fafco had not authorized the warranty repair but because it had been months I had been complaining about the situation, SP took care of their customer and installed all new panels at their own expense.  This is what I call outstanding customer service which happens rarely in today's world.</Text><gmapID>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9<//gmapID>< username>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Amazing! That is the best word to describe my experience with your company.

My home had a non-functioning heating and AC unit and there was no way we could endure another hot summer.  Although I knew it would be a huge expense I knew I had to start getting quotes.  I began with scheduling two other companies before I scheduled my appointment with Sierra Pacific.  After the first appointment was over my head was already spinning and I was feeling pressure from their rep to “just sign now” I hated the pressure.  When your design specialist Gary came to my home for our appointment he was courteous and knowledgeable.  He didn’t rush or pressure me in any way and even told me about financing options which I was not aware of.  After meeting with Gary I was sold on Sierra Pacific.

When the date for installation came Brian called me, introduced himself and let me know when they would be arriving at my home.  As soon as they arrived Brian re-introduced himself along with Ray and Jake and walked me through what would be done on that day.  Brian, Ray and Jake were friendly and polite.  They quickly began doing all the preparations and got to work.  They did an amazing job, stopping to answer any question I had or explain anything I didn’t understand.  The level of customer service Brian, Ray and Jake provided me was refreshing.  Both days when they were finished they would make sure I didn’t have any further questions and walk me though what was done and if anything further still had to be done.  When the installation was complete everything looked superb, clean, and professional and most of all everything was functioning like it was supposed to be.

I have already started telling my family and friends about what a great job Brian, Ray and Jake did and have been recommending Sierra Pacific to them.  I hope you know what amazing staff you have and appreciate them as much as I did. Kudos to Brian, Ray, Jake and Gary!

Thank you for maintaining the highest level of customer service, I will be going to you first for my further home needs!< /text>< Pics>

The new system was installed on June 19th by Brian, Chris and Seth.  These young men were hard-working and very considerate of us and our home and made the whole experience a pleasant one.  They did a fantastic job!

Before making our decision, we received two other bids, but by selecting your company and doing business with your sales representative and installers, we are confident that we chose the right firm.  Thank you and please express our gratitude to Tom, Brian, Chris and Seth.<//review>< pics>

Sierra Pacific and specifically John Abella with the Installation Crew did an excellent job with the installation of our Lennox HVAC system.  Our experience was excellent from the Installation Design Expert Dominic and the office staff.  We are very happy with the system since once again the temperature has gone up again in October.  When the Sac County inspector came to approve the completion of the building permit, he also complimented the fine work done by the installation crew.  When a expert on HVAC compliments the job you know you have a good product.  Thank you Sierra Pacific for a great job.</Review>

< Review>
My fan motor went bad, they carry no universal replacement motors like other companies as truck stock, they must install the exact motor they remove or are unable to wire the motor! Unless the colors matched on the exact motor! There are only 2 sides of power coming off the power pole to a house lol!
Service technician was an ex pool technician, could only install anything but exact motor.
This requires at least 2 trips and that is best case scenario!
parts acquisition and then a time to install it, could be days before that all happens! This makes the labor like doing 2 service calls instead of 1 call and gone! cheaper to hire pool techs and bill customer for getting the motor then coming out a 2nd time.
Management nor ownership has any hands on HVAC experience, magazine mechanic fudges as qualified individual for the C20 lic.<//Review>

<text>I was referred to Sierra Pacific Home and Comfort by Costco.  I asked for a second opinion when I was told by my current service provider that my air conditioning system was failing.  Sierra Pacific technician came and read several reports from my service provider and then inspected the air conditioning and heating system.  He, then, sat down and explain the reports written and told me my sistem was getting old but not failing.  I was shocked.  He could have concurred with my service provider and I would not have known any difference.  The company employs honest technicians and has moral vailues by telling the truth to homeowners.  As a result, I will get my upgraded system and maintainance from this company when the time comes.  The technician was very knowledgable and explained the air conditioning system in words I understood.  This company now has my loyalty and respect.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

On New Year’s Eve, our furnace died. It was not a pleasant event. Because of the holiday, it was not until the 2nd of January, Friday, that Sierra Pacific responded to our distress call. It was determined that the best cure was to replace the entire HVAC system. By about 6:00 P.M. the following Friday, January 9, we had heat. It was wonderful.

All of the Sierra Pacific personnel we have dealt with, during this time of stress, have been professional, prompt, and most accommodating. HOWEVER, the crew composed of three hard working, pleasant, efficient, and extremely tidy young men stood head and shoulders above the pack – Patrick, TJ, and Cody M.

They complimented each other and formed an outstanding team. They kept us informed. We felt that they cared, not only for the job, but also for their employer. We enjoyed their presence; and for a couple of weeks (days), missed their music and their chatter.

In our book, Sierra Pacific is the Colin Kaepernick of Heating & Air – the highest compliment a Nevada grad can give. He and the 49ers will eventually win the Super Bowl.  Sierra Pacific has already won our highest honor.< /text>

He could have concurred with my service provider and I would not have known any difference.  The company employs honest technicians and has moral vailues by telling the truth to homeowners.  As a result, I will get my upgraded system and maintainance from this company when the time comes.  The technician was very knowledgable and explained the air conditioning system in words I understood.  This company now has my loyalty and respect.<//review>

<review>On New Year’s Eve, our furnace died. It was not a pleasant event. Because of the holiday, it was not until the 2nd of January, Friday, that Sierra Pacific responded to our distress call. It was determined that the best cure was to replace the entire HVAC system. By about 6:00 P.M. the following Friday, January 9, we had heat. It was wonderful.

All of the Sierra Pacific personnel we have dealt with, during this time of stress, have been professional, prompt, and most accommodating. HOWEVER, the crew composed of three hard working, pleasant, efficient, and extremely tidy young men stood head and shoulders above the pack – Patrick, TJ, and Cody M.

They complimented each other and formed an outstanding team. They kept us informed. We felt that they cared, not only for the job, but also for their employer. We enjoyed their presence; and for a couple of weeks (days), missed their music and their chatter.

In our book, Sierra Pacific is the Colin Kaepernick of Heating & Air – the highest compliment a Nevada grad can give. He and the 49ers will eventually win the Super Bowl.  Sierra Pacific has already won our highest honor.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1526942713056, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing Sierra Pacific!\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}< /Response><GmapID>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I think this company does not  give a damn about the customer. I have got installed a new H VAC two weeks ago and now I have questions and they started to give me run around. When you call their number first of all it is busy than if you get hold someone that person has no clue what he or she is doing, and than everybody start pointing finger to other department/person but you an you are in limbo. I think I will file a complaint with BBB and t Costco as I have gone through Costco.< /Review>

For safety concerns, we have had to reschedule a tremendous amount of work that would normally have been done earlier in the season. The whole construction industry has faced the rain delays and once again this week late in May we are getting more delays from rain. We are working furiously to catch up with our work. We hope to get a chance to redeem ourselves for you in the quality of our work and excellent service professionals at your home.\nRespectfully,\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}</Response>< gmapID>
