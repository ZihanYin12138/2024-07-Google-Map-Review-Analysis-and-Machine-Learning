These people are the nicest people in California.  They love their customers and treat them like family.  I would eat here again for sure if in town.  Thank you so much for your hospitality and taking the time to make sure our dinner was a 5 star experience. - The Texas Family :)< /Review>

<review>I ordered the Stromboli(small size) with meat, garlic, and basil. The dough  was crispy outside and soft inside! The size was HUGE! I especially loved the marinara sauce because it was warm. My husband ordered the chicken parm sandwich and the chicken looked very crispy and it was a thick piece! Everything tasted very fresh. Definitely recommend!<//review>< response>

<Text>Hidden gem level 1000! This place has the best dough I've ever tried. Unlike other pizza places, they don't have cold pizzas on display and then reheat them. This is fresh baked and it makes a difference. I took a bite of the Stromboli with tomatoes and mushrooms and yelled, "holy s#%&!"to myself. It's that good.</Text>< Name>

Food is BOMB, and both types of crust (gluten free crust and regular) are sooooooo good! You can tell that love is definitely baked in every bite. Also, the fact that they have vegan/plant based options is a huge plus! the owners are very sweet and make you feel right at home which is the cherry on top. We absolutely will be back soon, and always love supporting small businesses like this! 😊🙌🏽</text>

First time visiter. Life time fan! The staff is so friendly from the ordering process to pickup. All covid precautions were taken.

The food:

The pizza and cheesy bread both were awesome. The large pizza is very large !

The chicken parm came as recommended by Raya and I have to agree the chicken is amazing.

Cant wait to try their stromboli and the meatball sub. Oh and the chocolate cake.</review>

I recently had a small work gathering and had mom's cater it. They were on time and delivered the food hot.   There were so many different flavors in all of the food we ordered. We sampled a bunch of different items.  Mom's favorite pizza is delicious! The combination of the jalapeño and pineapple is mouthwatering.  I'm getting hungry just typing this. The pizza also warms up nicely in a toaster oven. I would highly recommend their services for any catering events and just grabbing a quick lunch.  This is also a local owned family business that needs our support.<//Review>

Ordered Takeout of their pizza and calzone. The calzone was surprisingly light and delicious! The pizza was also very tasty. The ordering process and communication was crisp, timely and easy. The owner (i suppose) was also very friendly and had a genuine smile and welcoming personality. I look forward to my next order here and eventually a sit-down meal once the pandemic eases down</review>

Incredible food, great service, and a really welcoming family atmosphere to the whole restaurant. My favorites are the garden pizza, garlic knots and the stromboli—and don't forget to try any one of their desserts (the chocolate cake is to die for!).

Absolutely the best stromboli ever!
I stopped in to Moms Pizza and Pasta as it was recommended to me from a new friend.I  added all the Veggies minus pineapple and onions.  Raya recommended the perfect size just for me. I totally could have ate half then rode home, but after one bite.... I couldn't put it down! What makes this Stromboli exceptional is the crust is very light, the filling is generous and tasty and it is a great deal for the price oh and the sauce was a great addition. Usually Stromboli is served with a thick crust, very cheesy and minimal other fillings. This Stromboli is just the best ever! Go check out this spot! Well worth it !<//Text>

What can you say about Mom's Pizza they do it right their pizzas, strombolis and everything else they hand make there are positively out of this world. The service is fast and friendly you can't go wrong getting a pizza pie from Mom's Pizza</Text>

<Text>Haven’t found a good calzone in North County until this place. Brought me back to growing up in Northern New Jersey and neighborhood pizza place. They nailed the marinara sauce and dough which is the key and hallmark of a good Italian place in my opinion and almost impossible to find here anywhere in San Diego.

Fantastic Pizza, Stromboli, Chicken Parm, Meatball subs and even better service. This is now in my rotation for lunch and dinner! Perfect amount of sauce to meatball ratio claims my coworker. Lovely, clean, tidy establishment.

You can't miss the building. It's small but cute and Pink!  They have outdoor sitting and a drive thru.  We ate here twice and both times the food was very good.  They serve Menudo but Only on the weekends.  Please note they charge you a service fee of 75¢ for using plastic.< /Review>

This is it folks. These are some of the best tacos you'll ever eat. I've had the carne asada, lengua and cabeza and they were all delicious. Prices are great, service is quick and the flavors are all on point. Go here, get 4 tacos and a Jarritos and   enjoy every bite.<//Review>

The staff is friendly but the sauce on the enchiladas tastes like plain tomato sauce. The tostadas on the other hand are delicious and filling.</review>

Had to drive all the way back for my drink, I felt like I was overcharged .. and then the lady had the nerve to charge for a sauce that she didn’t give me in the first place.. really disappointed..  won’t be going back.< /Review>

I always came to this place tell they started messing up my orders almost every other time.so I decided to try out jiminez down the street after that been happy with that place. so today  i decide to try out lolas again well spent 35$ and the order got messed up once again charged me for cheese didn't put any and asked for no beans in the burritos and yes all the burritos had beans. Its either al Rico's or jiminez for now on.</Review>

The food was ok. I was upset because they wouldn't let my 6 year old daughter use their bathroom even though we purchased food here. They have one but apparently don't like children.</review>

My first time here on Sunday, I ordered a Bbq pork burger and garlic fries. I love their grass- fed burger options. The fries were delicious and the bbq pork was amazing. The owner was friendly, great customer service. I definitely recommend this restaurant 🍟<//text>

<text>Had a really really good burger and tater tots here last night. Was planning to go to the gyro place (which is also great) but decided to give Butcher N Cheese a try. Glad I did. The burger was delicious and the tater tots were incredibly crispy and tasty. It's definitely on my list of pre-movie eateries now that things are opening back up.< /text></record>

<Text>It's a good idea, clever name, fun location for us clmt'rs, and friendly people.  Good times can be had!!

I think, and don't know for sure 💯, that all the food here is frozen, thawed, and then heated up.  Seems to taste that way...  Even the grass? fed? burgers?  I guess that's ok?

Anyway - hope this place gets better over time!< /Text>< gmapID>

Nice chill atmosphere and good burgers. I enjoyed the Teriyaki burger and recommend trying their wasabi mayo sauce with barbecue sauce with their fries.</Review>

My husband and I have tried all the top rated burgers in San Diego and this one by far is one of our favorites! Great menu options, delicious and fresh taste, with wonderful service. BNC sauce is great to dip in their crispy seasoned fries! Can’t wait to keep coming back and try everything on the menu.</review>

<Text>I had a chance to eat here 3-4 times and I like the burgers that I ordered and it's good enough portions to satisfy my ferocious appetite. I like the fries, but I love the tater tots. I only know one other place that has them as sides.

Update: Wow a celebrity mom was spotted eating here at The Butcher N Cheese, none other than M J Shannon from Kim Kardashian show. This is amazing.

Great burgers and fries. Ordered the swiss chalet burger with beef patty, it was delicious, loved the sesame seed bun. Also had the French fries which were great. Only downside was very busy so not alot of available seating and if you get a table you have waiting dinners looking over you as you eat. Staff were friendly and fast service.</Text>

Wonderfully seasoned fries and onion rings probably the best I've had in a while. While I didn't have the burgers they looked amazing and there were good comments made regarding them. The wings however were of poor quality and were extremely fatty (breading, a thick layer of fat and grease and then some edible meat on the inside) which made me a bit queasy I couldn't enjoy the sauce on the wing because I was trying to dodge the fat. If you go I suggest the more traditional route of burgers and chicken sandwiches. You won't be disappointed.<//review><Response>None< /Response><Time>1578644714365< /Time><rating>4< /rating>< Name>

New place and very good. the food is a little inconsistent but overall pretty good. I had a hot dog with a fried egg on it. Might sound a little strange but it was delicious. They had to redo the fish-and-chip because the fish was a little overcooked.you can tell alot of loved one into creating this business. All new furniture. Immaculate kitchen. And the service was great.<//text>

Have had my eyes on this place for some time! Was pretty excited to see they had finally opened. First impression was the decor was pretty nice, the wall artwork definitely catches the eye. The menu is pretty expansive, even offering chicken wings (which weren't half bad.) I went with the "Good Ol Burger", which was pretty tasty. The beef is certainly of good quality, and the toasted brioche bun had the right amount of bite to it. The french fries left something to be desired, and the portion could have been larger, but they were hot and fresh with the right amount of salt so no real complaints there. Cost is a little high for the area, but for the quality of ingredients is more than acceptable. I will definitely be returning in the future.
PROS: Good quality for the price, food is fresh and tasty, diverse offerings without feeling hipster
CONS: Could have been more generous with the fries, for a place with "cheese" in the name the cheese plate offerings weren't much
OVERALL: I would definitely recommend this place. Nice to have a proper burger joint in Clairemont.<//Review>

The bison burger and lamb burger were delicious!  Our bison came out well done when we asked for medium rare. The patties were small for the price but overall the experience was great!  Super busy on a Friday night and Dinos next door had a cover band outside for entertainment!<//Text>

<review>Burger not cooked as ordered, not once but twice.
Owner threatened to refuse service after I raised my voice to be heard over a large party of screaming and unruly children whose parents where more interested in becoming over served with beer.
Had two previous positive experiences but tonight I cannot give more than 1 star despite not having been charged for two extremely overcooked burgers.
Due to the unprofessional threat of owner which was entirely uncalled for and unjustified, I say caveat emptor or buyer beware.<//review>< Pictures>

I had a crispy, delicious Patty Melt and my wife had the Better Burger, which more places are offering today. Here, the Burger was properly dressed, was on a brioche bun and was delicious. The location is convenient, plenty of parking, and right by the  Clairemont movies so great for a meal before or after a film, or whatever.<//text>

Very pleased with the new burger joint.  The 'good ol burger' was spot on.  My wife tried burger of month, rhine.... something, had beer cheese on it, was good as well. Fries were very good.   Definitely will go again.<//Text>

That didn't give us our Mac and cheese,  they put a salad in one order when it should have been fries, they put fries in another order that should have been a salad, wait time was over 30 min. Not satisfied very poor!!!</Text>

It is ok. I thought I might see an owner hustling with his new spot, but just two decently trained staff. I subbed the onion rings but no discount, 2 burgers, a diet Pepsi and a small craft beer: $38 before tip! The meat isn't that exceptional.  I think there are so many gourmet burger jounts...</text>

<date>1574437136047< /date><rating>2< /rating><Review>I wouldn't go back. Crab cake sandwich was overfried (batter was borderline burned and hard), not sure what the crab mixture inside was made of. Did it contain any crab?  Couldn't tell. The bread wasn't well toasted.  There was far too much gloppy sauce slopped over the fish. The French fries were very good. But the iced tea was tasteless. My husband's fish and chips also overfried and tasteless.  The condiment bottles on the table hadn't been wiped off (e.g., grimy fingerprints and mustard stained), which always puts me off (and concerns me). So, in short, for $40 for lunch for two with no alcohol or dessert, I expect far better. The menu choices sound very interesting but what I ordered wasn't well prepared.<//Review>< Pics>

The food was ok, service was ok, but nothing really stood out. The menu is maybe a tad too ambitious for their skill level; plenty of other restaurants in San Diego offer similar fare but better prepared.< /text>

Nice place, nice music... and cheap drinks ! A good way to spend the night, I will recommend to avoid margaritas or mojitos - they are undrinkable. Stick to the beer or soda !

The men's room is interesting, the latrine is a inch away from the basin you can wash your hands while peeing so you won't waste anytime !<//Review>

I'm usually embarrassed to review strip clubs because I don't want to be thought as a strip club person but this five dollar buffet is BOMB!!!! I'll be honest the ham sandwiches were weird but that fried chicken and that fruit was really good and so worth $5!!!!! Just come for the food!! And it's nice inside too!!</text>

< Review>
This place was decent until a dancer demanded more money from me even though I gave her a decent tip already. She wouldn't let me leave and pushed me. I had to push her back so I can escape and she went out and told the bouncers that I attacked her. I had to leave the place. Very disappointing treatment from the staff. She should be fired. You can't demand and block the way of a customer. If she had a problem with the tip she should go talk about it with the owner and then the owner contact me. There was no professionalism. I would not recommend this place if you want to stay out of trouble<//Review>

<Review>I hit a lot of clubs in the area and this place used to be really good.  But, recently not so much which bums me out because this place is near my office.  They had a few new girls but most of the better looking girls from the last time I was in are gone.  In addition a lot of the girls weren't really into it.  Classic sitting on a couch staring at their phones.  I will give them another shot because  of convenience and if it picks up I will happily edit but for the time being I would avoid the place.  If you do decide to go get the coupon on their website. Then you can save $10 ($20 cover is crazy especially for the talent offered)< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1553361641591, 'text': 'We take complaints just as serious as compliments.

The girls dont approach you. And are on their phones. Like they dont want to be there. And the entry fee $20. Too much. They gotta get all the ladies to be more outgoing. And most of the time it looks like they're just hanging out In the bathroom . While there's a naked stage.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Best place I have been to in a long time. There are always people there and They have good pricing. They have many areas to show you a good time and the girls are very sociable. Customer service is the best i have ever seen in this business. I have never seen or herd of personally of any girl being rude, pushy, or expecting a large tip. I would rank this as one of the top 5 best gentleman's clubs in LA. And i have been to most.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The servers were the highlights. Gorgeous and attentative. The vibe was pretty cool overall. I just made the mistake of getting a private dance with the wrong girl.
Half the time she just laid on top of me. The first half was straight than she just laid there. After I wouldn't agree to get another private dance. She called it quits.... 5 minutes early</Text>< user_name>

The girls here don't even try to talk to you. Are picky with what dances they will let you get with them. This one girl had bad breath. And after the dance she kept on insisting i tip her. And was rude about. And chases you for it. And then tells the next girl do she wont get a dance with you. Will not come back after this. Very disrespectful 😤 to the customer.</review>

So, I visit Deja Vu Noho with my bf about once a month, and just returned from there tonight after a horrible experience, all of which was caused by the DJ. The DJ there has always been kind of annoying, but was always pretty pleasant. Tonight though, something was just very very bad and he completely killed the vibe of the entire club single handedly.

First off, he was playing absolutely horrible music that had no real dance beats and even a few of the dancers were complaining, but he did not care. I heard other customers also complaining about the music.

The Dj was also calling girls up to the stage so fast that none of them knew what was going on so the stage sat empty most of the time. or had 2 girls dancing to bad music at the same time which was really awkward.

We ended leaving after about 15 minutes because of how bad it was, and I saw a few other people leave as well. I should add that tonight was by far the busiest I had ever seen the club, but he made sure people left unhappy.</Text>

The manager Anthony was very unprofessional and rude. I’m not sure how he got the title manager but he did not show leadership qualities and does not know how to talk to people respectfully. There was about 3 patrons in the club and two dancers. A ghost town.</text>

The place has a variety of charming ladies by their styles, physique, and ethnicity. I liked that there is no drink minimum unlike the downtown location where i would hate buying ridiculously overpriced drinks cuz I HAVE to.  Carter is a fun and sexy girl, and so is the Ukrainian girl I forgot her name but I think she's the only Ukrainian. Violet is pretty fun, and the other girls were friendly as well, and let me not forget the cute and friendly waitresses. Overall, great experience</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Very bad service. Watch out people , There is a stripper, Sophie Lu, she is Asian. Don't buy any dances with her because from the middle of the dance she will leave you and ditch you. Also, there is another Asian tall waitress, she is very rude, don't buy any baloom dance with her. In addition, if you complain to the manager they won't listen to you, and the best that they can do is offering you free pases. They will not return your money back.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Kind of expensive, and kind of dead at the same time.

10 years ago was much better, it was a great club, but not anymore.
Seams like they just hire any girl that's willing to dance.
No more standards for this club.

I met Mike, the manager, at Adultcon and he suggested that I come to his location to celebrate my birthday. This was my first time at a Deja vu and I had a blast. Mike wasn't working when I went but I met another manager I think his name is Hector and he was just as hospitable as Mike. The management here is stellar. The customer service was awesome and the girls are gorgeous. I am hard to please and I have zero complaints. Lol promote Mike and Hector. Super personable and welcoming management only enhances a lit evening. Girls are pretty good too. Too many to name. I rarely do reviews but I wanted to take the time to say thanks.< /Review>

I aoplied at Deja Vu on Main Street downtown LA, I went up to the club in the evening and the young lady at the front desk told me I couldn't speak to the manager because he was in a "meeting". The website clearly says to come to the club so you can meet with the manager in person. I left my name and number at the front desk but no one has called me. She didn't even offer me an application.

So today I applied online for Deja Vu NoHo, I received an email then I called and spoke with Sharon - she was very nice, professional and friendly. I told her what happened at my last attempt and she told me to come up to the club tonight after 5 to speak with Mike because the managers like to see you and your personality. I asked Sharon do any black women work there, she said no.

I think this is the issue with Deja Vu. I don't think they want black women working as waitresses or dancers. I say this because of my 1st experience with the downtown club and to find out there are no brown skinned dancers or waitresses at NoHo gives that vibe.

I'm just trying to make some money and have fun while doing it. I'm attractive, sexy, curvy AND I have an outgoing personality. Not to mention that I'm a huge fan of Larry Flynt's Hustler Casino in Gardena - I play baccarat here and I love their VIP room.

Sharon invited me to come to the club tonight but I will not be going - NoHo is not around the corner from me. I'm in LA and I don't want to waste my time and my gas and I don't want to be disappointed again. I guess I'll keep looking. ~LeLe~</text>

Nobody does it better than the big, bad deja Vu! Come by sit back,  relax and enjoy the scenery. This place does it right dont miss out on all the fun. If you have never been then you have to try it at least once dont be surprised if you find yourself back.</Review>

Before Sea View, picking out new glasses felt like going to the dentist or trying on bathing suits. It was a chore. And, let's get real, who enjoys that? I used to spend way too long trying on dozens of glasses only to go home in a pair that looked OK from certain angles (alright, they looked terrible from ALL angles) and would inevitably become my "at home" glasses until the whole exhausting process would start over a year or two later.

And then I found Sea View. My experience here over the last couple of years has been nothing short of transformative. Every single person that works there is lovely and talented in what they do. Shout out to Maria, Eric, and Brad! They create a space and a process that is comfortable and feels like home. No kidding. I actually feel confident and *gasp* pretty in my glasses, which I wear every day IN PUBLIC. Shocked? Me too.

If you think I might be exaggerating, just know that I've now gone back to Sea View about three times in the last few years and brought numerous friends, who now travel an hour in LA traffic just to go here. And they bring their friends too. It's that great, y'all.</Text>

{'time': 1626397943010, 'text': "Dominick,  We are so sorry that you did not enjoy your last visit to Sea View.  While working with our insurance specialist, she was trying to give you the information that the insurance requires us to go over with you as well as trying to let you know what your insurance coverage is and how that aligns with your desires for your glasses.  Unfortunately, you seemed to not have enough time to allow her to finish her explanation.\nThe other issue that you mentioned to our specialist was that you did not want to pay for the copays on your glasses and when our specialist explained that it was required to pay at least half, you mentioned that you never had before although looking at past records show that you always paid on the day that you placed your order.\nFinally, when there was a printer malfunction and she attempted to print your prescription from another computer, you did not want to wait the moment that it would take and instead chose to leave without a copy of your prescription.  After that, we've had no contact from you to instruct how you would like your prescription sent.  I invite you to call our office and let us know where you would like it mailed, emailed, or if you would like to pick it up.\n\nI would like to remind all patients to make sure that they allow ample time for their examinations and eyeglass purchases, it is not something that can or should be rushed.  We wish you luck with your future eyewear needs!"}<//Resp>
<userid>115908796827269220802</userid><pics>None</pics><Text>Been coming here for over a decade. Last experience sucked. The optometrists have always been enjoyable and they do provide a quality service, but the office staff does not strive to provide the same level of service. I walked out of my prior fitting super frustrated with the staff. I found the staff to be uninformed on insurance, very opinionated and unwilling to listen to my purchasing interest, and lacked the ability to resolve technical issues in a timely manner. I left without new glasses and they could not even provide me with a printout of my new prescription. I am very dissappointed with Seaview Optometric. I am looking for a new optometric center and still trying to get my new prescription from the staff.<//Text><user_name>Dominick Owens< /user_name>< rating>

Sea View Optometic Team, once again you’ve knocked the ball out of the park! For nearly 10 years (I believe it’s been that time), you’ve provided me with excellent customer service and eyeglass frames worthy of compliments. Your attention to detail - including - cleanliness and adherence to COVID-19 protocols is also worthy of kudos.< /text>

I appreciate the work and time that Dr. G offers to his clients.  My only wish is that the office had more affordable frames to choose from.  It is hard to believe that the range of frames begin at just over $200 and go up from there.</text>

I was severely sick.  I called in to reschedule. I left a voicemail. I received a call back to reschedule and was informed I would have to pay another $25 deposit. I forfeited my first deposit because I was sick and cancelled my deposit. This is the second bad experience after my last exam, I wanted to look at glasses, and it was more important for an employee to sit and do paperwork for a customer that left than to help me!< /review>

If I can give Sea View 20 stars, I would. I hadn't been to the Optometrist in 20 years. I am SO happy I came here. Jim, Dr. Mitchell, and staff were so welcoming and helpful. They took their time, they made me comfortable, and I felt right at home. You would be doing a disservice to yourself going anywhere else. Who can honestly say they had a blast going to any doctor? For once, I can.. I am appreciative of my experience and would recommend to anyone!<//Text>

I really loved the atmosphere of this place and the friendly staff. Im glad my boyfriend referred me to this location and I will definitely come back for future check ups and do any upgrades on glasses etc.

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>The staff is absolutely incredible! You walk in and everyone is always smiling; including the customers! The way the optometrists here operate is more conversational to the point where you know they care about their clients. They absolutely take the time understand what's going on and have been very helpful. When it came time to pick out my frames Connie was extremely helpful and patient. I'm very indecisive and no one here makes you feel rushed or pressured. In the past few years of coming here, the customer service and experience keeps getting better. And I've always left with adorable frames!<//Review>< response>

I purchased a pair of glasses from a different company and stopped here to get them adjusted. The fella that helped me was really knowledgeable, very friendly, and professional following the "Covid" Laws. I will 100% be coming back here for my next pair of glasses.<//Text>

I have been a patient of Sea View Optometric Center for years and I am more satisfied as the years pass!  The staff is extremely friendly, courteous, and attentive.

I'd like to start by saying that my experience was very pleasant from the moment I called to inquire if I would be able to use my frames to have a new prescription put into my glasses.  The office person who helped me was polite and was able to get me in the same day if I wanted but I opted for a next day appointment since that worked better with my schedule.  This was my 1st time with the new Doctor since moving to Long Beach, Ca. and when I arrived they have their own parking which is always nice.  The staff was very polite and greeted me when I came in and the wait time was minimal.  Then I was attended to by Dr. Gwizdak who was very thorough and explained what was happening with my eyes since it had been quite some time since my last checkup.  Dr. Gwizdak's bedside manner made my visit quite comfortable.  The doctor even helped me with an eye stye that had been bothering me.  All in all I am pleased that I picked Sea View Optometric.</Text>

Terrible customer service and consistent mistakes amongst their new staff. Namely Daisy and Richard. They will claim they are double checking and say things worked out but it doesn’t because there was a mistake every time or miscommunication amongst the staff. In response of me telling them, the head administrator took his employees word over mine in such a disrespectful way. Although they said they would fix the problem (of which they ordered me the wrong frames) there was no sincere apology and my trust for them to serve customers is depleted.<//Text>

When you were unhappy with the result our administrator offered to remake the glasses that you picked out into a different frame.  Unfortunately, you felt the need to belittle the staff, to cuss and drop profanities with great ease, and make both our employees and our other customers feel unsafe and uncomfortable with your rude and unnecessary aggression.

Very friendly and professional staff and doctors.  You can't go wrong with either doctor, but most of my experience has been with Dr Krys G.  The opticians are highly experienced and the office stands by their product.  If you think something is wrong or "off"...they will fix it and make sure you're happy with the end result.  Customer service and professionalism you cannot obtain at discount eyeglass retailers.< /Text>

The staff are polite, friendly, and helpful. The doctor is so professional and explained for us everything in details. They have very wide selections of modern frames (nice brands), but slightly pricey.
This place is equipped with many advanced technologies to help you get the best prescription possible!

My wife and I are so happy that we found them.< /Text>

<text>Family optometric center for many years now. All interiors completed so fresh looking and new testing machinery too. Very calming professional front of house staff, great prep and follow up. Appt made from website request, and a phone call. Perfect exam, left with perscription and a trial pair of contact lenses.

I liked previous line of frames (Pucci) but the winner seems to be the pattypaillette line. Not for me but fresh looking.  I will probably get my frames from Warby Parker online as they donate a pair of frames to others.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1583773805007, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the kind words; we are genuinely excited about the changes that we have made in the past few years.

I don't usually go around reviewing places, but this is truly exceptional. I needed sunglasses while traveling. Bradley is not only very patient and helpful in selecting what works for me, he is also very knowledgeable about lenses, manufacturers and different products on the market. Too. Ad this place is half a world away from my home. I'd definitely come again.< /Text>

< Review>
The first time I went in this shop, I talked with Jim, who is more informed about frames and lenses and fits and sizing than anyone I'd ever talked to before. He spent at least 30 minutes with me showing me different frames that might work for my face, and explaining why so I could understand and apply that information to other frames. He also suggested I look into VSP vision insurance and do some math to see if it would save me money in purchasing frames, and said he'd be happy to sit down and do all the calculations with me once I figure out what plans I could get.
I needed to absorb that information, and when I came back another day to narrow down frame choices and figure out insurance, I spoke with Maria. Maria, equally as knowledgeable, ended up picking out the frames I eventually purchased, and has spent lots of time over 3-4 visits answering all my questions about the frames and pricing, and even taking pictures so I could look at the frames at home.
The frames are more expensive than most places I've seen, but with insurance, the total came out to something I could afford. They both, Jim and Maria, have also been able to adjust my glasses and sunglasses in a way that made them fit better than anyone I'd ever gone to before (and I've tried a lot of places!). I definitely can't afford multiple pairs here, but when I need a new pair of quality frames, I will definitely return!<//Review>

Seaview is awesome. I have been going here for my eye care needs for over 5 years. I have seen both Dr. Gwizdak and Dr. Mitchell. Both are great doctors and care a great deal about their patients. On my most recent visit, I needed to place an order for contacts and eyeglasses. The optician was incredibly helpful and helped me find the perfect pair of glasses. He was patient and considerate of my budget. The contacts I was hoping to get before an upcoming trip which I would be leaving for 2 days from my visit to Seaview. Horrible procrastination on my part. Of course the contact order would not arrive in time but the optician was kind enough to provide me a sample pair to take on my trip! The Seaview staff truly went over and above which is why I will continue going to Seaview!<//Text>

The doctors at Seaview Optometric Center are friendly, thorough and usually on time with appointments.  I especially like the thorough explanation of my eye health.  I like having the flexibility of late day and Saturday appointments.  I would always recommend Seaview Optometric Center.< /text>

We carefully cultivate our frame lines and hand-pick all of our styles to meet as many needs as possible.  Over the past couple of years we have worked very hard to do away with styles that are not up to our quality standards and replace them with lines that we know to be well-crafted.  We have selections at every price point and to have styles for every taste.  Our styles are updated often to keep up with the ever-changing pace of fashion and our helpful opticians will always search for a frame that suits your style.'}<//resp><Name>Douglas Kinsman<//Name>< text>
Very efficient staff but very disappointed in the selection of eyewear to choose from< /text>

I walk in the seeview optical, hope they fix my aunt eyeglass frame hinge broken,  one of ladies with a blonde hair asked me if she can help me, i show the the broken frome eyeglass, she fixed it and how I owed her, she no charged, if I ever need eyeglass seeview is 1st choice, because they don't just do business for money, but they are out to help people.<//review>

Maria was so nice to take care of it for me! I had called several places who weren’t willing to help and my personal optometry office is closed on Saturdays. Thank you, Sea View!

My 1st experience was very good.  Receptionist quite busy yet handling everything remarkably well from start to finish to follow up.  Dr. Kris communicated well to me in every way-professionally and in regards to when she would perform some action.  There were no surprises.
The dental assistant was very unobtrusive inside my mouth-the best I’ve ever had.
Thank you for the time you’ve spent to develop such thoughtfulness.</review>

Had my first experience with an ultrasound water pick which is used for cleanings at Sunnyvale Dental Group.  Took the time to scrape my teeth and really show the reasons why my teeth are collecting so much plaque.  Had my first crown here and the attention to detail performed by Dr. Hilado was very impressive. Super minimalist approach, she even hand dug the final bits of decay as to not disturb the nerve under my tooth.  Very quick when it comes to doing fillings/crowns.  Uses fillings/crowns without heavy metals (porcelain for my crown) and is very excited about using new technology in the industry.  Entire staff and front desk are super friendly.  They are happy to go over what is and is not covered by insurance.  If you have to wait ten minutes for your scheduled appointment, relax and read one of the cool books in the office,  its worth the wait for best tooth care in the Bay. P.S. Ozone therapy for $70, can't beat it.</Review>

While I have been coming to this office for several years now, I am outraged by the complete lack of transparency about random charges that they are sending to me 7 months after a dental cleaning that was fully covered by the insurance, and we (the clinic and I) double-checked beforehand that it was fully covered by the insurance. The $$ amount is not significant but it is the principle that matters. NO! You should provide the information in advance or acknowledge you are not sure if you don’t know... but you cannot say one thing and dent responsibility after.<//Review>

<Review>If you are looking for a great dentist and exceptional hygienist, you have found the right team. Dr. Kris Hilado has a steady hand, excellent eye, and is very gentle. She gets bite fitment on fillings right the first time and has been able to correct issues with old fillings that I had given up on. Lynn Santos is always very thorough and takes extra care around sensitive areas. They are holistic in their approach to dentistry and use very good composites. I have been coming here for several years now and have had no issues with any of the work.< /Review>< Rate>

We love this holistic dental practice and highly recommend it to all of our friends and family!

All four of our kids (ages 8-13) love having their teeth cleaned by Lynn.  She is very knowledgeable, gentle and through.

Dr Kris does outstanding work and uses proven materials that won't damage your health!  She recently replaced my last two amalgams with porcelain.  They match so well that you can no longer tell I have fillings in my teeth and I had absolutely no negative health repercussions during or after the removal (despite being sensitive).</Review>

As a crunchy mom i wanted to make sure my family is handled by a well informed health care provider and Dr. Kris Hilado is the best! She is very excellent and passionate in her job, giving top quality care treatments and recommendations. We are willing to travel from Fremont to Sunnyvale just to have our smiles fixed.

Dr. Chris Hilado is the best Dentist I have ever had.  I can HIGHLY recommend her. Anyone fearing going to the dentist, fear no more. One time I almost fell asleep while she was fixing a cavity. This was incredible. She is the best Dentist to work with, listens to your needs and is just an overall very pleasant person.

Happy to finally have found a dentist that I will keep, I love everything about Dr. Hilado, I highly recommend her!</review>

Really kind and gentle dentist and hygenist. Both were great for me and my 3 yeast old son. Only they have no respect for time.  4 appointments, been kept waiting a minimum of 20 min for all of them, some as much as 40 min on a 30 min appointment!< /text>

I've had good experiences with this office. They were the ones who removed the mercury from past tooth fillings and discovered a cavity on an X-ray that my previous dentist had missed.  For this visit I had scheduled due to some teeth sensitivity (brushing too hard) and some discomfort chewing. I liked how the problem was isolated to my gums and thank God my teeth seemed to be OK (an X-ray revealed no issues). So the issue was taking care of the current teeth sensitivity while the gums heal. I was given the options of a filling or something called  I-M paste. My insurance wouldn't cover a filling since this area was previously taken care of and it wasn't over 24 months yet. I'm glad that I checked the ingredients of the I-M paste as it contains casein and I have to be dairy-free. When I asked if there were any other alternatives I was offered ozone treatment that would help heal the tubules and mitigate the discomfort.  This seemed the best option since it was quick (less than 5 minutes) and painless. I had originally leaned toward a filling but wasn't guaranteed that it would work since the issue was on the side of my teeth.  I'm wondering why the ozone option wasn't presented at the beginning when talking about treatments? I may have given the impression I was concerned about cost but if it is effective and quick, then it's worth it to me. 2 days later my teeth sensitivity is still being kept at bay so I am happy.</Text>

It look more than 50 mins from the time the order was placed. Even though online lets you sign up for the rewards program this store doesn't do any rewards program.</Text>

Affordable and typically delicious take and bake pizza. Head there on a Tuesday for sweet deals. Ranch is okay...dough is thinner (THANK YOU) than round table. Pepperoni is okay.</review>

< Review>
The owner is dishonest and hasn't cheated me out of a lottery win. He literally switched my lottery sheet numbers with another sheet.I realized later my sheet was thiner than the one he handed me back.I wish I had caught it sooner because I would have had evidence for my attorney.He also changes the price of the cigaretts. It'll be one price one day then another price another day.I can't stand a businessman who cheats the community that keeps him open.<//Review>

I went to the smoke shop but not for myself I took a friend this place was very very clean it is a smoker's dream place it had everything a smoker could think of. From what I could see there was wall-to-wall of stuff. Customer service was excellent.</text>

Great prices and even better service. I can't think of any other place you can buy a name brand pack of cigarettes like camels for $8 even, and the pretty girl with the beautiful green eyes makes my night every time I see her and her cst service is Soo sweet.</review>

<Review>This guy has insane deals, I compared to every shop in town. He ha 30 mil for 7.99 and other tremendous deals. His price betas any body else. If you find it cheaper he will beat the price. I love this shop, I buy all my cape and a new smok unit. You will be amazed how cheap he is unocirn milk 15 mil 13.00 Other places at his store unocirn. I'll 15 mil 5.99!!!!!

Special promo mention my review and get even more of a discount. This dude is crazy he wants all the business at he will beat anybody anywhere.

!! Favorite shop - going there now, need a coil.<//Review>< Pictures>

Easy check in and out, great customer service, very nice vehicles. I needed a rental for the day and was so happy with the rental provided, a 2020 Chevy Malibu. It was beautiful inside and out. I will definitely use Enterprise for my next rentals!</text>

Had to quickly rent a vehicle because mine needed repairs. They were very kind and virtuous. Picked me up from the dealership and dropped me back off when it was time to pick mine up. Very fast service and the rental vehicle was in good condition.</Text>

Enterprise Car Rental, didn't have the SUV that I expected, however, the SUV MITSUBISHI Outlander SUV was amazing.  Sometimes you get better than you expect.  We were very pleased with the Outlander.  The service was great, fast out and in when you reserve on-line.  I'm looking forward the my next rental.
Thank you,
Robert</review>

I rented a luxury vehicle from my local facility.  I had earned National free days pre-pandemic, and was happy to know they could be used locally at Enterprise. I received wonderful service both booking the vehicle and on-site with Paige. I  received a terrific vehicle and it was great not having to go to the airport for a rental. Impressed!!< /Review>

Initially, I thought I had a good experience with the rental I got from this location; however, my credit card was charged an additional amount with no explanation.  When I called to ask about the additional charges, I was told someone from accounting would follow up.  I never heard back from anyone.  I had to dispute the charge to even learn that I was charged two additional hours of rental time.  I still do not understand why this was not discussed when I returned the car.  Disappointing experience.<//Review>

<review>Wow- impressed with this Simi Valley office on LA ave! They answered my numerous questions and resolved my 1 concern with smiles. It can be frustrating to rent a car with uncertainty and websites which show conflicting information, especially when the standard is “unlimited miles”.
No problem for this A+ team. Received outstanding  customer service from start to finish, which is why they set the high bar for rental cars!!</review>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I live in the UK and was visiting family in SImi Valley, Ca. recently. We had no problem renting a car from them for our road trip around California and Arizona. I am already a Enterprise reward customer in the UK. After driving to the Grand Canyon and back we wanted a car on short notice a couple days later to take into LA from SImi Valley, as renting from Enterprise was cheaper than using Uber or Lyft. When we got there the only vehicles available were a small (by US standards) pick up or their V8 Camaro SS we lusted after for the road trip down Route 66, but couldn't afford for a week. When I said I was looking for a vehicle that would be cheaper to rent than using Uber/Lyft, they offered me a great deal on the Camaro. Thank you Spencer and your manager at Simi Valley for giving us the perfect end to our vacation by letting us rent that muscle car.<//review>< date>

Great great great customer service! The only part I don't enjoy is that I've met so many great employees and then they're transferred and/or promoted and they're out of my customer service life forever (sad face). Seriously, I've been a regular customer for about 3 or 4 years and have always been treated like a part of the Enterprise family, which may sound cheesy. I appreciate everyone at the Simi West location and enjoy renting my weekend/weekly rentals when needed.</review>

<review>Hands down, why would you go to any other place.  i have tried many over the years.  Price:  Enterprise will all ways do better.  Quality: The car you get will always be immaculate.  Service: All the staff are trained well, and they put you first.  I know this sounds like a commercial, but seriously!  Enterprise is  the best.
They will pick you up, they will drop you off.  Their check-in process is quick.  If you have any problems, the store manager will make it better, or if your complaint is at the end of your rental, he will give you break on the price.   And if by chance you could save $10 or $20 with another company. Is it worth your time waiting to get service, having to endure a sales pitch why you should take the insurance, etc.  Nope.  Keep it simple,  use these guys.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Plus one star for quick and easy service at pick-up.

Minus one star for renting a car to me that reeked of headache-inducing smoke, despite the no smoking stickers affixed on the dash.

Plus one star for allowing me to trade in the said stinky car the next day.

Plus another star for giving me an upgrade on this rental. They didn't really have a choice though. There were no other comparable cars available.

Plus one star for this new car itself. Love the Mitsubishi Outlander!

Minus one star for serving another customer before me, despite the fact that my arrival to the office and lot was before his.

Minus another star... for serving another male customer before me, despite the fact that I arrived to the lot and office before him! I really don't care if you know this customer by name.

Here is the kicker... I had to speak up when a third MALE customer was about to be helped before me again... one that arrived after me. What can explain this pattern? Is it that this office is located in Simi Valley, and that's how things are? Is this how all Enterprises are run? It is 2016. Misogyny is so last century, people. No matter the case, I just know that next time, I will renting a car from another establishment. It will be worth it, even if the rate is higher.<//Review>

Excellent customer service.  I booked a car for 4 days and ended up wanting to keep the car for 7 days. I called them explained my dilemma and they were cool enough to give me the weekly rate. Downside was the car I picked up had no gas. The Toyota corrola I rented had all the latest in radar and safety features.</Review>

Been using Enterprise for many years. My own car has over 360,000 miles on it so when I want to go out of town I use Enterprise. They are fast, friendly, picking up is never a problem (we went with another place once last year and they promised me a ride back to work and did not follow through so I ended up walking almost 2 miles in my work shoes). They are very fair if you disagree with something and the prices are reasonable, especially the $9.99/100 mile weekend day deal. If you want a well maintained car and great customer service I would highly recommend Enterprise, we even use them when we are fly in somewhere because of the awesome service< /Text>

The staff were friendly and accommodating. I reserved an economy car, but they were out. They gave me the option of a larger vehicle for the same price or they'd find an economy at another lot and have it delivered to me. I chose the larger vehicle. It was clean and performed beautifully on my trip. When I returned the vehicle, they were happy to give me a ride home. Quick in, quick out, no hassle. I'll be back.< /Text>

<Review>Hey, who ya gonna call.? I rent often from this office and rarely have an issue. Cars clean and well maintained, and employees are always helpful, efficient, and knowledgeable.  Appreciate the timely  rides home and the Weekend specials. It can get busy at peak times- morning drop off and before closing- and Saturday mornings
My suggestion is try for off hours. And speaking of the staff, I have often seen them at crunch time bearing up professionally under relentless pressure from impatient customers.
Ill be back, guys. Reserve me a hot red convertible for this weekend!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>I wanted to put 0 star if possible.  My personal car was in garage of a dealership nearby that had parts issue so they reserved a car here for me.  When I arrived here to pick up the reserved car, the workers in this rental car office asked too much of my personal info even after having my license info and credit card information. The dealership would pay the rental and I had to come back to pick up my car.   This rental car company urged and forced to get 2nd phone number of one of my acquaintances.   Moreover they asked my employer's information.   I was under the impression this went too far.   So I asked why they needed my employer's info. I was not there to apply for their job.  Credit card, license, current address, and two phone numbers should be good enough to be able to reserve a car.  Also they were already paid by my dealership that was holding my car in their garage. And it was just a day of reservation!   The clerk in there said "we know your address, but you may be in Idaho later today, how do we know?"    Are you kidding me?  Ultimately they declined the service and gave me ride to the dealership.   This was ridiculous and not making any sense.  If you don't care about giving out all of your personal info, you may be fine.  But if you do, you probably don't want to go there.  They seem not value customer's private/personal info.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1538778397999, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, Bhbae1.

<Text>Service from staff was great, despite a cement truck in the already-tight lot which was pouring foundation for a new car wash, which will belong to this office.   Good thing, since my car was plenty dirty outside when I rented it, and the wiper fluid was missing.   I filled it, but it still didn't function.  The efficient staff will surely be relieved to have a more reliable way to ready their rentals for their customers.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I rented a car and was automatically given an UPGRADE.  I got a NISSAN Optima ??--a large comfortable car.  I really can't complain about Enterprise service.  They were good.  THAT CAR WAS TERRIBLE!   The front windshield is designed in a manner that allowed the sun to GLARE into my eyes during the day. The back windshield is designed even WORSE.  At night, coming home on the freeway,  the glare from the cars behind me reflected on the from the back windshield onto the front windshield and blinded my field of vision..  I finally made it home safe.sound.  I returned that monster car and got a Chevy Cruz.  Less space but at least I am alive.  Just thought you'd like to know.

Pleasant and professional staff.  Wrecked my car in an accident.  Rented a car for a couple of days from Enterprise.  Body shop told me repairs for my car would take longer.  Went back to Enterprise and was about to downgrade the rental for a less expensive vehicle, to do the longer rental period.  The staff at Enterprise lowered the rental rate to that of the less expensive car.  Now that's great customer service!</review>

I use this Enterprise once a month.  They are always polite, friendly, and accommodating.  The cars are always clean, I have often gotten brand new cars with under 500 miles.   Sometimes I have to wait a little bit if I need a ride, but they are one of the few rental agencies in town, and  people need to understand that.  I have been renting religiously from them for well over one year, I have rented 13-15 cars and I have never been disappointed.  If I had to say one thing that this Enterprise could improve on, it would be the location.   It is an awful spot and you have to pull out right onto LA Ave.  They need a better location.  Otherwise--I have ZERO complaints in at least 15 visits. :)< /Text>

<Review>This has now happened to me twice in two years...they discover damage on the car that was not visible to me or the agent when I checked out. Upon returning the car all of a sudden they discover the damage that was there before I rented it and now I'm caught hold the bag. I can't trust this company anymore and expecting customers to go over a car prior to driving off at a level equal to judging Pebble Beach is unreasonable. Never renting from this company again.</Review>< Pictures>

My wife and I went in to rent a car while my truck was in the shop.  The office was crowded, but when it came to our turn the staff was kind and courteous.

When I called in to extend my rental the woman on the phone remembered me and provided me with great information in a timely manner.

It's important to note that parking at this location is EXTREMELY limited, so you may end up having to park around the corner.<//Review>

<review>My local enterprise Rent-A-Car here in Simi Valley has  always come through for me in a pinch. I had an unexpected car repair and needed a rental right away. I called up my local enterprise Rent-A-Car office  at 764 E. Los Angeles Ave. The staff is always helpful and efficient. They got me right in and out with the rental for the weekend within an hours notice.  It's great to see this kind of customer service these days.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Please consider using a different rental car agency before you book with Enterprise, especially at this location. I made a reservation for a standard-size car, but when I arrived at the Enterprise lot, the only vehicle they had was a large 4-door F150. Not even close to what I reserved. All the other customers present encountered the same problem– we all made reservations, but there were no cars for us. I had to wait at least 20 minutes while the staff scrambled to correct this sloppy error. I ended up with a Nissan Versa, which is closer to what I originally ask for, but still not right.

Nearly 4 hours after leaving the rental lot, the manager, Tevin, called me with a tepid apology, and was still unable to get me the correct car. These people failed at every step of the way.

This rental car agency is not reliable, and it appears that reservations mean nothing to them. I will never use Enterprise again, and I strongly encourage you to do the same.< /Text><resp>{'time': 1533755765215, 'text': 'Scott Patrick, we would like to look into this further.

After our motorhome  breaking down and not being able to get there on time, I was told that they would move our reservation to the next day, but they did not have the staffing to pick us up the next day. Isn't that the sales gimmick for Enterprise?? Now I have to maneuver a 40 ft. motorhome to go pick up my car. Not happy Enterprise!<//Review>

Awful experience. They are totally unprofessional. Still waiting for my explanation about my $100 deposit and the second $5 and something second charge on my card. If some could please call Leanna Mitchell back like you said you would almost 4 days ago and explain. That would be great! P.S. and don't tell me it's because the rental I received not asked for was more then my insurance would be paying daily because the shaddy character who gave me the rental not a rental I asked for or chose was given stayed everything was worked out with my insurance. Was that a lie?< /review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>It was alright.  The first time I reserved a pickup truck it wasn't available on the day I went to pick it up.  They expected some back but nobody ended up returning one.  I did get a call that one could be brought over from the Thousand Oaks branch but it was too late in the day for it to work.  They did offer an upgrade to an SUV but I needed a pickup.  Anyhow, I set up another reservation for 2 weeks later and this time they had one when I arrived.  It wasn't clean whatsoever but it was there and pretty affordable given that it was a new truck.

I've rented before from them and I will again.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>In all the years we have used Enterprise,  this is the first time where the rental agency hit an all time low.  I ordered the car online, giving specifics including pickup time and desired car model.  When we arrived to pick up the car, we were told that the car was ready first thing in the morning which is not what was requested.  Then the car what we received was not what was requested and  was not clean with  less than a quarter of a tank of gas.  This is not what we are used to and were very upset.  I voiced my concern but the agent barely paid attention.  Guess I'll be using another service even though Enterprise acts like they are the only game in town.  News flash!  Avis is right down the street!!!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I would strongly advise NOT using this rental agency! Unfortunately, they have the monopoly.  Since they are virtually the only car rental agency in the area, we don’t have a choice. Each time I have rented from them I have stood in line about an hour. Today there were 16 people in line with only 1 employee. With all the money they pull in you would think they would hire more employees. That is just greed. Will someone please open a new car rental in the Simi Valley area so we can get better service?!< /Review>< pictures>

It did not have an antenna,nor was it washed and the reverse lights were constantly on.

<review>When I think of Enterprise, my appreciation is always for the professional and well trained staff who have been sending me on my way with a smile for many years.This location may have been having a bad day on the day I rented but it was lacking that signature. No cheerful greeting, and the vehicle I reserved an month earlier was filthy and had only a half tank of gas. I was picking up clients and had a long drive so I had to wait. I grabbed some lunch and came back for my vehicle. I got underway and much to my disappointment, the tank was still half full. My subsequent conversations with the managers sufficiently resolved my issue. However, my return experience supported my review of the staff being below the average.</review>< Resp>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I am a frequent flyer in the Enterprise rewards program and used them for over twenty years.

While perusing reviews of the Los Angeles Avenue, Simi Valley Office on the west end of town I am amazed by the negative reviews.

In all my transactions-- at least once a month if not more, I have had nothing but the best,most respectful and courteous service possible.  The employees have bent over backwards to make my rental a pleasant experience.

Granted the physical facility leaves a lot to be desired, but the convenience of pickup and return service makes it ideal.  Hopefully, if in the next year??, the carwash addition is ever finished, the problem of cars not being highly cleaned as expected wioll be a thing of the past.

I will continue to use their services!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>The driver who picked us up hated her job and told us. The place was crammed into a small lot and was basic. The manager was arrogant and rude. The policy here is a $100 deposit for a rental only taken on the actual client's credit card and refunded after returning the vehicle. We were in an accident and our insurance covers the rental. Why should we pay for anything? They finally gave it to us with a $50 deposit that we have to wait now 30 days to get back and they were rude about it. Not going back here again.</Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Long time Enterprise user.  Disappointed with value now though.  Dirty car (stained), over 20k HARD miles.  Enterprise no longer has free XM radio on cars that come with it for the first year for free...  Hertz on the other hand still offers XM for free - with a substantially cleaner vehicle.  Location was friendly and quick - hence the two stars.< /Review><username>Kevin Wolfe< /username>< gmap_id>

These people don't get enough credit. Everyone waits to the last 30 minutes of the day to turn their cars in and get stuff done. They take an acetylene torch and burn that smile on to their faces and deal with each self important non contributing zero like they are the king or queen. Bravo.</Text>

<user>102446475760884873031</user><Review>I been with consolidated staffing for years and I can definitely vouch for what ever negative you ever heard about them is a thing of the past they've improved in so many ways such as they're so much more willing to help not like before they actually care and want to see you get a job that suits YOU the best instead the old ways when they just send you out wherever. Cynthia help me out expeditiously to get my check situated. It was my fault in the first place but she still helped. Everyone there is awesome thank you consolidated!!< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

!!!!!!!  I REPEAT FIND A BETTEERR AGENCY THESE PEOPLE WILL SCREW YOU OVER !!!!!!!

These guys are a joke don't even want to pay me 2 hours of show up time even though the person that they sent me to says I wasn't on the list but their excuse.. you were two minutes late so we can't pay you nothing but you were on the list how is it that your assignment that you sent me to says I'm not on the list but you guys say I am just because I'm a few minutes late you can't pay me I hope everybody sees how much of a joke this is trust me they do care about you showing up but even if you do show up they won't give you the benefit of the doubt save your time go find a different place like affluent Staffing or Staffing Network those guys pay you for showing up even if they are in the wrong if they own up to their mistakes so if I were you I'd go choose a different agency I wish they understood how we feel when we're not getting paid for showing up to a job they assigned us to but we're give different info when we show up to the assignment< /review>

<Review>I never got my W-2 forms for 2017. They said I have to pay $20 to get a copy. Why would I have to pay money if I never move from where I live. My address is still the same. They're allowed to ask for a fee if we're at fault, like moved and never updated my address, orhot than that, they can't collect a fee. Don't work here unless you want to have missing hours, they're checks also bounce. Two times that I know of.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I hated this place I will never work for this company again... I have worked so much overtime when I was there and never seen even half of it.. they would always have an excuse like oh you never punched in for the day. when I damn well know I did. I didnt clock back in from my lunch cuz i came back a little early they docked me 45 minutes.. This happened at leas once a month. You were a minute late, you punched in on the wrong clock, This company does not care about their employees at all if I could do negative stars I would.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The worst agency, some of those who work there are very rude and have no way to talk to one, believed to be more unable, if for some reason you cannot go to work, even if you are missing for the first time they call you irresponsible regardless of The reason you could not go, even if it is a disease, they start telling you things without respect, I do not recommend that they go to this place.

<text>Cheeseburgers were cold.  Cheese wasn't melted.  It was gross!  No one wants unmelted cheese on their burger.
Jack in the Box always has hot burgers.   Why can't McDonald's serve them hot?  I am probably going to stop eating at McDonald's since this is becoming a regular thing.  So disgusting!!!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I like McDonald's, and this one is no exception, except for one area.  My wife is a critical coffee drinker, and can't stand the coffee at this business.  When in town, I get my coffee here, but I have to go to Starbucks for her coffee.  If you know good coffee, this is not your place.  As I said, it is fine for me, so you may enjoy their coffee as well.  They do have one employee that is very unhappy with her job, so may snap at you, but the other employees are delightful.<//Review>

<pics>None<//pics><review>This is a place where I stop when driving back home from Salinas, very convenient. But I never get my order right. And I'm all ready 15, 20 miles away when I find out. Specially the sweet tea, never sweet and full of ice when I said clearly: "Easy on the ice, please". Also, some of the cashiers are not friendly. But like I said, it is convinient, it is exactly halfway of my trip and I need to stop somewhere.< /review><GmapID>0x80eccf8cee6bac13:0xfb6aa285b35839e1<//GmapID>< userid>

Drive thru was not it. We were in line waiting and the lady was having us wait for awhile and kept on taking from one line only. We ended up going to the other line and the lady gave us attitude and had us waiting and said nothing. We tried to be respectful as possible but we ended up just going to Carl’s. The service was really bad. This Mc is a place I wouldn’t go back to< /review>

<userid>107541214084213859304< /userid><Review>Literally worst McDonald’s ever. Only reason I go is because it’s the only one in town but most days I do drive an extra 10 miles to go to a better one. The managers and workers will literally fight with you they did everything right and then when you get home and check it’s all wrong of course and they refuse to fix or acknowledge anything and never get a receipt. Seriously just the worst crew and service every single time. Just thought I’d put the real thoughts of Paso out there.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>I admire this place! They provide good dishes, they have a nice menu, The chef in that restaurant is a professional, I like a lot eating all their dishes. The food is always fresh, the service towards the clients  is friendly. I  go often to this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it with no hesitation.</review>< pictures>

<Review>The staff is good, but the manager Jaime (he is brown skinned and big) has the worst customer service. He is rude to customers & the workers, he even raised his voice. When I asked for his name he wanted to act “nice” all of a sudden. He should be fired.< /Review><username>Leslie Davila< /username><user_id>110527140503416264802</user_id><Rate>2</Rate>< Response>

3 stars only cause, I wanted a medium drink and a large fry, when given a medium fry i politely corrected them saying I ordered a large one, they looked up and walked away for a second and came back saying they only charged me for a medium fry, I went inside to show a receipt and saw they had a HUGE line. So I am thinking rather than giving me the right order they decide to lie to me to push me through the line.

Edit: I asked for no mustard add Mayo on both burgers and they had no mustard and no mayo... Really disappointed</text>

<Text>Customer service is non existent here.  They really need to train on how to communicate with customers.  Say hi.  Greet them with a friendly smile and tone.  When I came by, all I got was a "What can I get you?" and she kept on trying to rush me every 10 seconds when I tried to look through the menu.  You want to get paid $15 an hour to do this job?  Start acting like you earned it.< /Text><username>Wolf Jones<//username><Gmap_id>0x80eccf8cee6bac13:0xfb6aa285b35839e1< /Gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics><user>105467977743915578248< /user>< Rating>

They didn’t greet me at all, I come in & they immediately say “can you order at the kiosk?” We has no idea what this meant? So my boyfriend said jokingly “no we can’t order at the kiosk” (cause in his mind that means going behind the counter and typing in your order lol) And the manager was right there and they she treated us with disrespect. she talked to us like a rude robot after everything “is that all” is that all? She was rude.

I look behind me and know what the kiosk is now. I just can’t believe what the work world or certain food chains are nowadays. Under staffed and over worked and it shows<//text>

<Text>The food was great until I ended up stuck in a public restroom from being as sick you wouldn't believe with food poisoning! And I used to love this one. But they're in such a hurry to get the customers out of there that they're undercooking the food. PS I'm not the only one who's had this issue with them</Text></record>

The cashier was inexperienced and unhelpful. I ordered 3 ranch salads, one fish-olet, a Big Mac for my family. I had to repeat at least twice for each order. When I added a mini-Mac special, she didn’t know what it is. I told her there’s a big picture on their outside window, she said they didn’t have it. This is unheard of. I then asked her if they had something similar cuz the order was not for me and I didn’t really know their menu. She just stood there giggling to herself. I asked her again but her didn’t say anything.

The manager (believe his name is Hynie) stepped in to tell me loudly in front of other customers to calm down when I didn’t say anything mean or yell at them. I reminded him he should be the one to calm down. He then asked the cashier to step aside for him to take the orders. He asked me to pay for the 3 salads without other orders then got frustrated at me when I had to repeat the other orders I already told the cashier.

They gave us the wrong salads. He was unhappy when we told them about it. Then we realized they didn’t give us the Big Mac, we told him. He didn’t believe us, thanked god we checked our orders at the counter so he couldn’t accuse us for taking it for free. He got mad then threw the Big Mac into our bag. He was rude, mean, and unprofessional. No wonder the employee behaved the way she did. If we weren’t under time pressure, we’d have walked out to Carl’s Jr. next door. These people desperately need training, maybe customer service 101 class for start. They need to learn how to communicate and respect people.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I go for the fries and the iced coffee. It's like one for the road before we head back to King City. Although I prefer they McDonald's in King City because they have my favorite invention the freestyle Coke machine. Unfortunately this one doesn't. it's a shame because if you have been drinking diet coke since 1986 you kind of want a change. this service was acceptable also. And the fries were hot that is a good thing< /Review>

One of best mcds I've ever been to in the entire US in my travels. I never eat here except breakfasts. Entire breakfast w hotcakes was $4.99 (IN CALIFORNIA). Everything came with it, jelly, split muffin, great egg. Came out 3 min after ordered, nice clean spot. No complaints can be found here.< /review>

This is the second the second time this has happened to me at this specific McDonald’s. I pulled up to the drive in intercom and waited at least 8 minuets before having to drive off. Did not  get a response whatsoever from anybody as I tried ordering several times. And yes it was definitely open and there was no one in front of me. I thought this was supposed to be fast food<//review>

Well McDonald's is McDonald's. What can you say. Decent place relatively clean and the employees are pretty friendly and helpful when they can be. Food is decent it's typical McDonald's food for better and for worse. The kids there seemed to love the place though.<//text>

<user_name>Tracey Paskowitz< /user_name><Pics>None< /Pics><review>We stopped here for treats after a long road trip. We picked here because it looked like they had the original arches and logo from McDonalds' first stores! We loved the movie 'The Founder' so it was fun for the kids. It's super clean and modern inside. Small parking lot and a little hard to get to off the freeway (we had to back track) but the staff was nice with typical McDonald's food. Always good for a special treat! The surrounding area is really cute too.<//review><Time>1505422043743< /Time>< rate>

This rating is for the quality of this particular McD's.

I have gone here many times within a month, and their service is good.  But I had a horrible experience with one of the night managers. When I went up to give my order she was very rude. And kept giving me attitude and on top of that she was rushing me and didn't even ask me if it was a boy or girl for the happy meals. Once we got our order, I went up to ask for some sauce. She was so rude about it. When I went back to my table where we were eating I noticed that my husband Quarter Pounder was raw.  When I went up to tell them.  The same night manager was rude about it. So I finally called her out on it and she had sent another employee to give us our fully COOKED Quarter Pounder. After that experience it made me not want to go again.  It's really sad that from a bad experience with one employee ruins it for the restaurant. I have since gone back and have gotten better customer service. I really like the fries from this McDonald's because where I am from the fries aren't that great.<//review>

This location has a nice contemporary interior.  This is a convenient stop during long drives on 101.  The food is like any other McDonald’s.

Update:
The last time I was here I ordered a 10-piece McNuggets and only got 9.  Not cool McDonald's.</Review>

I did not like it, the Sprite was watered down, and the lemonade was watered down too. To end it on a good note, I asked for a plain cheese burger(meat cheese and bun, you should try it) and they did it correctly.<//review>

<Review>In my opinion McDonalds are usually ran like a tight ship.  This one was certainly clean.  I was a little disappointed that there was no ketchup in the dispenser (or maybe it was clogged) and both my hashbrowns were exceptionally soggy.  It was 6:30ish in the morning and I feel like the oil might not have been hot enough.  Otherwise, it was a mediocre experience at best.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Subway restaurants are great places to  eat; whether ur doing breakfast, lunch or dinner - hands down!! Always fresh ingredients, nice selection of breads & prices are reasonable w/daily specials! Oh yes! Their "2" choices of soups are to die for👍(Broccoli Cheddar) & I think the other is (Loaded Potato)✔them out. So delicious & the 'cookies' also.<//review><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80eccf8cee6bac13:0xfb6aa285b35839e1< /gmapID><Name>Pammy Ladd</Name></record></dataset><record>

Very rarely go to McDonald's, but, it was a quick and curious service. New cashier so some delay on a couple of items. Service and food was as well as expected.</Review>

Staff, especially daytime lady manager, could use some serious re-training. She stood one day and slammed a worker over and over in front of customers--you do NOT do that. . .it wasn't even about customer service. Many of the staff are grumpy, npot friendly. A few are good, but not a lot. Sun-standard for McDonalds.<//text>

Terrrrrrrible service. Also not suitable for children especially if you have a child in a diaper. They informed me because they have handicap stall they don't have to have a changing table to babies....and then told me it would be inappropriate for me to change my child's diaper on the property... Really Mcdonalds?!<//text>

Can't expect too much from McDonald's but I do prefer my food hot. Crazy, I know. Cold fries, rude staff, looonnnggg drive thru lines. I'm cool with waiting as long as my good is hot but it wasn't so 2 stars they get.< /Review>

If you're not Hispanic you're going to get treated like crap here. The employees will not make eye contact or say hello or smile or anything the food is typical McDonald's food however they forget to give you napkins through the drive-thru.  I had to make a separate trip back inside to get napkins for my meal.<//Review>

Well the food tasted very different from previous. McDonalds locations. I wanted a bag to take to go but they didn’t tell me that they were closed at the register so I waited there like 25 minutes so I just left.<//text>

While you are eating, you are presented with a nice view to look at. Fairly clean place. Minor inconveniences though, like the ketchup "machine" running out.</Text>

Good place except they have no changing tables in the bathrooms. McDonald's is supposed to be a little more kid friendly.</review>

<review>Sprite taste like water. Water was dirty. Tea was clear. Bathroom look like a scene from a horror film. one person returned their ice cream because it was melted by time she got it. The lady just lifted the to of the machine and dumped the old ice cream back into the machine. It smelled like the bathroom throughout the entire store. over all, the worst McDonalds in California< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< Review>
Upon a quick visit, we visited the bathroom to find it in poor condition, wet and smelly and in great need of cleaning. Needless to say, we left with only purchasing an oatmeal and did not use the restroom, and walked down the street to starbucks instead. I've been to many McDonalds and this one was by far in one of the worst conditions.<//Review>

food is almost always gross, customer service sucks since this is the store that trains all new employees hired, bad location for drivers due to really close access to on/off ramp for interstate 101 and highway 46 and paso robles fairgrounds travelers beware of speed limits coming into Paso Robles because its only 25 mph after you pass the light at the freeway, also a frequent hotspot for homeless peope panhandling for money if that bothers you but most if not all of them are harmless and likely to help you than harm you. Offers video game stations inside galley for kids and free WiFi.< /review>

<text>We decided to hit up McDonald for a snack after leaving the Water Park next door. They have two lines for cars in the drive thru, however, the person speaking in Lane A was drowning out the girl we were speaking too in Lane B. We kept telling the employee we couldn't hear her. We finally got our order placed and drove up to the window. We tried explaining to her that she was being drowned by the other girl. She gave us a rude reply about how she couldn't hear us either and that they were "working on it". Then came the disaster at the food window. 5 drinks and 2 straws. yep, 2 straws for 5 drinks. Then the Mcflurry which was once again not mixed. I don't know why McDonalds doesn't just rename them to sundae with candy on top because they never are mixed any more. No honey for the chicken nuggets as requested, two bbq sauces for 20 pieces and no ketchup for the fries. Apparently there must be a secret password to get condiments at this McDonalds. We had to pull over in the parking lot and run inside to shake them down for some straws and sauces.</text>< Response>

< Review>
It's the wost McDonald's in the central coast.
The service is always very rushed and they never allow us to finish our order before they ask if that's all we want. NO DAMN IT. I want more ! They seem to hire idiots and children.

Oh. And the food is gross. I won't be back.< /Review>

Food wasn't good, fries tasted like metal. Maybe it was an off day, but a waste of money regardless.</review>
