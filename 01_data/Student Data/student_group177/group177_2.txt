Had an excellent experience here, from start to finish. Staff was very helpful and explained everything well. Car was hit on the passenger side near the rear. Went here to have car repaired and it came out excellent! And was done quicker then I expected. 👍<//Text>

<review>Great place! Front office persons were excellent. Every person I came in contact was professional and had a good attitude. My favorite was 209 (Paul). A true character.
I shared my phone experience with Hertz. To my surprise, front office experienced the same rudeness while I was there; front office immediately phoned Hertz and alerted manager of rudeness to their employee and self. GREAT JOB!
My car was completed quickly and they even cleaned it(IT NEEDED IT BIG TIME) Thanks guys.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80900c8ec95ab577:0x78fc879ec2122979</gmap_id></record>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>One word, "WOW!!!" I was really impressed with the whole process from start to end. AAA and Certified Collision Center is truly #1 rated companies to use. My adjuster Laila Morris was so helpful everything was a breeze.
I want to start off by giving a shout out to Taylor from Certified Collision Center for being so welcoming and kind. Every call I had with her was pleasant and she was always very helpful doing all that she could to accommodate. When I was there, she made me feel comfortable engaging in conversation. Paul was my estimator and he was also phenomenal. He had someone rush across town to pickup a part for my vehicle that morning for pickup so that my car will be ready on time. He also had my messy car cleaned and vacuumed. The car looked so good at pickup, especially my bumper. I was so impressed with the outcome I couldn't stop smiling and telling them how happy I was. The whole process was very smooth which was a huge surprise to me. I started out extremely upset due to someone hitting my front bumper and taking off. However everything was as smooth as it can get. You know how you see the AAA commercials and how simple it looks? Literally just like that. Funny, but grateful. The whole rental car thing was a breeze as well. I was worried I would have to find someone to go with me for pickup and drop-off but nope, the rental car was at Certified Collison Center waiting for me and I was able to drop it off there too. I can't thank Paul, Taylor and my AAA adjuster Laila Morris enough. You guys are amazing. Hero's in my eyes... Take care all, especially during this COVID-19 Pandemic. I really appreciate everything that you did. Treating people as kind as you do, really does make a difference. Guess what, to top that off, they sent me a free.... "OIL CHANGE!!" Just what I needed. Guess they read minds too, LOL. I'm so happy words can't express. Now that's the kind of service everyone deserves. Choose AAA and Certified Collision Center!! You won't regret.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80900c8ec95ab577:0x78fc879ec2122979< /gmapID></record>

<review>When my car was actually, finally ready, after delays and making me come in when it was half done, the workmanship was good.
But the experience before completion and after pickup was not what I expect to from a business.
I dropped off my vehicle as instructed and when instructed. I'm told to expect it that Friday. Friday comes, they tell me that the guy that disassembled it no longer works there, that it might take the guy stepping in to assemble it a little longer, since he didn't take it apart. I was told it might be ready end of day Friday, if not, Monday late morning, since they need to do a quality assurance check once done
Monday morning I'm told it will be ready Monday afternoon. Monday afternoon I'm told it will be ready Tuesday morning. Tuesday morning I'm told it will be ready Tuesday afternoon. Tuesday afternoon they tell me they really don't know when it will be done since they are backlogged with the guy leaving and no one there was sure how my bumper goes on. So I insisted they provide a rental car, which they did, my insurance stopped paying on Monday since the shop told my insurance it would be ready.
Wednesday the shop calls to say my car is done. Funny how fast they move when it's costing them money. I make the trip up there and they bring out my car. They did replace the bumper and paint a body panel, but two other damaged pieces of trim weren't changed and these were on the estimate. I guess quality assurance doesn't check things very closely. To make it worse, they don't know where my parts are. The guy that quit must have them I was told. They overnighted new ones and it was ready the next day. They tell me to leave the rental with them. They did pay the rental, but I got stuck with a gas bill from the rental company. I think the shop should've stepped and paid that. It was their fault my car took an extra week.<//review>< Pics>

Excellent food, excellent service, great ambiance. Has a great happy hour deal and you can sit in the bar area, or you can get some excellent service in the seated area... which is divided into the main area, a side room and also a back, elevated area. One of Cleveland's best.< /Text>

Took much longer than was originally supposed to and tried to blame the insurance. Quality of workmanship was very good but the customer service from Sierra at the front desk definitely needs an overhaul.</Review>

< Review>
My Coffee Roastery is an amazing place to grab a cup of coffee! I'm a big fan of their nitro cold brew, and their regular cold brew is great too. The coffee shop has a very unique layout and outdoor seating.</Review>

<review>Best lattes in the area. No contest. Still making pumpkin lattes too! Real pumpkin, fresh made. Yum! I buy their house blend beans - which they roast themselves - all the time. Super good, super consistent.<//review><user>112317468693285342535<//user>< Rating>

Wow this place is so cute and inspired by great design and aesthetics not to mention delicious coffee, tasty pastries and friendly service. Filled with light in a historic space that has been reverentially renovated. I just want to hang out here all day!</Review>

<Review>They're so nice! They roast their own beans (lightly roasted coffee beans - more caffeine! 🤸‍♀️) here! Mom & pop with son, shop. They have affagato here! They accept cash and credit too. What a sanctuary, right in the hectic chaos of construction, people, sounds, noise but here, I feel safe, like it's a haven, I'll be taken care of. 💖 This is a lovely place with lovely people. I'm truly looking forward to visiting again!<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< GmapID>

Beautiful cafe. So peaceful, clean and gorgeous.  The customer service was superb. Family owned and such incredibly sweet people. There are 3 seated areas: outdoor front area with small mosaic tables and chairs. An indoor heated area with 2 sides of high bar window seating. And another outdoor covered patio with larger tables. I had a cappuccino and their seasonal Japanese cheesecake. Both are delicious and well made. This gem is definitely worth looking for parking for. I highly recommend 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼< /text>

This is my favorite coffee shop period. The owners are incredibly knowledgable and excited about coffee. They go out of their way to learn your name and make you feel like this really is your roastery!

They roast all their own beans, and source from a variety of locations. The pour over Geisha coffee from Panama was the best I've had in my life. There is a free pour over with every bag of beans, so you can compare how your brew tastes against their masterful brew! It's incredible when Christine brews the coffee it tastes like premium coffee flavored tea, it's so smooth and perfectly extracted!< /Text>

Lovely cafe in a cute and homey space with lots of natural light (both indoor and outdoors)! The owners, who also run the cafe, are very knowledgeable about coffee and take pride in the entire process from bean to cup. MY is probably the friendliest coffee shop I've been to, they always have great energy and conversation to share and remember your name too <3</Text>

Coffee is excellent. They perform their own roasting which keeps the quality very high and the atmosphere is laid back and super friendly. I love going here for coffee in the morning, it's a great start to my day!< /review>

The BEST whole bean coffee. MY Coffee's roasting technique brings out the fruity notes of their African-sourced beans without the sour that you find in other light roasts. Totally worth it!</Text>

<review>Tucked along the busy MLK thoroughfare, two coffee aficionados share their labor of love.  I walked in to Christine (the barista) serving a latte topped with a two-colored heart-within-a-heart, delivered with a wholesome, "thank you for your support!"  As humble newcomers to the specialty coffee scene in Berkeley, their commitment to mastering their craft is authentic and what will certainly sets their shop apart.

What made me excited to visit them was how they've staked their reputation on roasting their own beans.  Most small cafes will launch by brewing and serving the beans of reputable roasters, but Peter and Christine are drawing from their years of experience to roast and serve delicate cups of coffee in a cafe of their own design.

"It's like walking through a time machine," said Peter in describing his thoughts behind building the countertops. "[As you walk in] it's modern, but stepping into the back it becomes more historic."

I ordered a washed Ethiopia pour over coffee, and watched our artist at work. Christine's pour over technique was wonderful - delivering a floral coffee with a sweet lingering aftertaste.  She explained her coffee with the excitement of a musician telling the story behind a new piece: quick to point out how the coffee she made, with beans aged 20 days past roasting, had a gentler taste than when it was first roasted.

MY Coffee Roastery is elevating the specialty coffee scene here in the East Bay, and they're doing so in the most authentic way possible: by studying every roast, educating the community around their coffee, and making people happy with every cup they serve.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

Great service. The lady who cut my hair, I didn't get her name, had long nails and when she was done cutting my hair she kinda ran her nails through it to air it out. It felt freaking heavenly. And I was very happy with my hair cut too so even better< /Text>

Did not get the cut that I really wanted. It seemed that he was in a hurry after two request to cut more and felt he wanted to just get rid of me. Need to pay attention upon request.</Review>

<Review>My wife and child waited for an hour in the parking lot in their car. They were told they would call and let them know when their appointment was ready. But they let other people who were walk ins before them and did not even look for them. Sorry to say My family will never do business with this Great Clips.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1611842922130, 'text': 'We’re sorry to see this.

As a treat I took my niece for a shampoo, new haircut & style however even though they offer styles I was told they could not do it on a weekend since they are busy.  Funny if you need a style it’s for a special occasion normally that would be on a weekend. I was disappointed I could not get her what I promised.<//Text>

I've been growing my hair out for a few years now and has bleached it many times so the ends were awful. I came in today very nervous as I only wanted to trim an inch off my long hair and didnt want to lose my length. My stylist Teresa did an outstanding job! She made me feel comfortable, and didnt lop off all my length. My hair feels and looks so much healthier now! Thank you, Teresa! You're my new go to gal for a great trim!</review>

I always get a great haircut here and the staff is always super friendly. They listen to what I ask for and help get me the cut that works for my hair. I always get compliments on my cuts. They keep notes on your services so it's easier to keep getting the same cut each time if you want<//Text>

<Review>My poor 4 year grandson got the worst hair cut it took her 25 minutes to cut his hair and  when I ask if she was new as she chopping off his hair a heavy set man that worked there told me not to be rude. He was rude. And for the record my grandson was very good sitting there and didn't cry not even after she cut him. I'll never go there again.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Honestly this school is amazing, I just finished my 2 years and I had a good time. I got done what I was supposed to and I am moving on to CSULB. The school is somewhat big or okay size. From what I heard the upper level math class have teachers with accents difficult to understand. This school has 2 years free and EOP&s which turned out that I didn't pay for anything. All i know is my experience was a good one and they honestly do care about the students.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Best Community College I have been to, they have a lot to offer. Their programs help to guide students into their specific major. The career counseling helped me realize which career I want to be in. Also I found the math lab very useful and they even offer it Saturday mornings. They have the best staff who are very knowledgeable and caring and listen to you and offer the best advice to achieve your individual goals. I highly recommend this school for anyone who needs the help and guidance to help them achieve their educational goals.< /text>< Pics>

If your a nature lover, this is the College for you! The lines aren’t ridiculously long, it’s a short wait to be assisted. The staff are professional and well networked with all the campus. So they are effective in helping you and making sure you succeed in your educational goals! If your serious about your education, you should go to a school that honestly has what you need. Rio is a great college and view!< /review>

<text>Nice, small campus with a scenic "mountain" view. The professors/instructors so far were good and motivational. The staff in the offices? Most were polite and helpful compared to the staff in East La College, except just one rude and curt lady(who is usually not there but happened to be there when I was there once) in the admissions counter. The usual guy in the admissions counter is helpful and cool and the lady who's always in the counter across admissions also is friendly and acts professional with a welcoming smile always on her face.<//text>< pictures>

I thought I would hate college, since I hated going to school my entire life, but wow this college is awesome. The school is really small. You will learn how to get around with ease. The campus is also on a hill, and surrounded by lovely nature, trees and animals of
All sorts. Which I personally love. The tutoring system is amazing and I’m completely satisfied. I really abuse the math and English tutors everyday! The library is beautiful (my favorite place). The food though could use improvements though, but that’s about it. 99% of people are very friendly so it’s a great environment for me personally. I never thought I would love going to school until now thank god wow! I will never transfer to another college I love this place and I can wait to start school again.

P.s if your taking English classes I recommend taking Mr Callinan best English professor hands down. He changed my life and made me love going to school. Cheers! -Allan Mora</Text><Time>1516302076599<//Time>< Pics>

The vibe you get and the level of education is amazing. Most of the professors are actually UC teachers who teach as favors because they actually want to see people succeed. The connections I've made, the things I've learned, are all things that I know would have never received anywhere else. Sure parking is horrible, sure getting classes is hard, but it's all worth it in the end. Forever a roadrunner!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I love this school. For the most part I get good teachers. I have encounteted some horrible ones, but they are horrible because they don't help their students. They are qualified to teach, but have a sucky attitude. Parking sucks if your lazy. Usually the main parking is what is packed. The other side of the school has plenty of parking. The trolly passes by to get picked up so not sure why people rather spend and hour looking for a parking spot in the same lot. Classes are easy to get. They have good food as well. They need to have two registers open though, I would highly recommend that. Chicano History is the best here. This school needs more English programs for people who want to become teachers. PCC offers better programs for that, but I don't like that college. They suck.</review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Terrible people working for their financial aid department. They have made me make multiple trips because they fail to tell you any additional papers you need... I've gone twice and both times they tell me I need one thing and that's all I'm missing and when I went back all of a sudden now I need all this other stuff and I have to appeal which takes weeks!!!!!! So ridiculous.... Can't wait for his semester to be over so I can leave this terrible school!! Don't come here if you need help getting assistance to go to school.</Review>< Resp>

I like most of the staff except for this Doctor who is crazy and teaches the LVN program she was rude and disrespectful they did not tell her anything after I told them she had said she didn't believe in me but it's ok I'm to the RN program in another school but the positive side is I met my fiancé here and I likes my math teacher Robert Botello and Fay Daryous they helped me so much with my math parking is crazy the first few weeks come early and I like the programs that they offer< /Review>

(Translated by Google) A great community college, with complete facilities and services. There are relatively few Chinese students, so it is suitable for new immigrants or international students, invading school English and various professional subjects. Learning in a school without Chinese language services, speaking and listening are particularly rapid. The faculty and staff are very enthusiastic and have a very good attitude. The experimental kindergarten in this community college is especially recommended. The best and most intelligent teaching concept allows children to develop wholeheartedly and teachers to provide children with high-quality educational resources. 👍+

非常棒的社区大学，整体设施和服务都很完善。华人学生比较少，适合新移民或者留学生沉侵式学校英语以及各种专业学科。在没有华语服务的学校里学习，口语和听力进步特别的快。教职员工都很热心服务，态度非常好👍特别推荐这个社区大学里的实验幼儿园，最好最智慧的教学理念让孩子们全身心的发展和教师们用心的为孩子们提供优质教育资源。👍+<//Review>

<review>Love this place
The sevice is awesome,  and they have good daily  deals ! Its not the best Mexican  food i ever had but it definitely is GOOD TASTING! I GIVE THEM 5 STARS cuz the customer service along with the food is five stars together. And yes I would recommend it to anyone. Right now they have to go only but they have a really nice setup for everything is sanitary and you just ordered through a window. They are closed on Mondays I barely found out today I went and was sad to see it closed and then another customer was parked right by me and said I feel the same way< /review>< user_name>

<review>Food is good, homemade food with a authentic taste of Guerrero. The owner and the waitress create a homely and uniquely Guerrero enviroment. The food, is very good, priced for what it's worth and offers a very good array of Mexican and other food selections. Ambient is laid back and calm, offers happy hour and drinks.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I ordered red posole. The posole that came out was white and looked to be mixed with red. Perhaps to cover up that they may have ran out. The bowl was 90% hominy. Whatever pork in the bowl was really tough and dry. They give you mediocre home-made tostadas with beans smeared on them along with cheese of cotija. It was all bad. When my concerns were brought up, they did nothing to rectify the situation. They were also surprised that I wrote a line straight through the tip portion of the bill.< /text>

<Review>I think Juicing is going to be a thing for me!
I have just tried a 3 Half Day Detox Juice Cleanse & it definitely has improved me in various ways.

First & foremost I want to thank the staff & especially to the older gentlemen who took his time to explain to me what the Cleanses were about.
Don't get me wrong, the first 2 days were hard but after the first two days I felt like it was easier. The main benefits I obtained were riding me of toxins, helped repress my appetite, & my skin glow.
I am going to go back soon for more selective juices for daily intake. I did open a Rewards program which I can't wait to continue to use. See you guys soon.</Review>< pictures>

Juices are really good, I commend them on their creativity in coning up with flavors! The crew is always friendly and helpful, and offer samples every time - it’s definitely gotten me to buy juices I wouldn’t have tried otherwise. You’ll like the friendly and welcoming experience and the menu is simple so getting started is easy. Very good!<//Review>

Delicious products as expected, made simply with real ingredients. They will let you sample their flavors. They also have hot beverages and I really like their Turmeric Latte. Not too sweet, very creamy and made with their almond milk. No upcharge for the almond milk!!< /text>< resp>

<text>I also wish y’all would sell the watermelon-mint-lemonade year-round instead of only in the summer months. It’s my favorite flavor. At least my three favorite Pressed Eats: Zuma Valley pineapple-coconut balls, dark chocolate coconut TruthBar, and Santé garlic almonds are all available here.</text><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

Great instructor!! Abhi helped me a lot and was very kind and patient. I learned so much in just one lesson! I usually get really nervous especially meeting new people but everything felt natural and he helped me feel calm when I would get nervous. Super helpful and very nice. I would 100% recommend and would gladly drive with him again!<//Review>

I recommend this driving school for various reasons like their instructors are very patient and calm. They work with you and give you fair criticism. I had very good experience taking lessons from them. I passed my test in first attempt. They work with you instead of making you feel that you cannot drive.</Text>

The school has proficient instructors who provide professional inputs on the drive techniques and rules. My instructor was Zain, who was punctual and motivating.

I highly recommend All Season Driving School.

My instructor, Gosai, is very knowledgeable and patient. Gosai is very accommodating with the schedule and is always punctual with the appointments. His teaching approach accelerates the learning process and reflects the experience he has.
I’ve also been taught minimally by the other staff and they were equally good as well.

I highly recommend taking the test day package - they teach an hour before the test and prep your mindset to be confident and well prepared.

Overall, this driving school is one of the best.< /review>

I paid All Season Driving School three lessons for my teenager daughter quite a while ago but my daughter couldn't finish up after the first one due to her own reasons.  When I contacted the school again, they scheduled her lessons to meet her need without any argument. She has had two instructors and they both were very patient and considerate. I actually scheduled extra hours as I felt that the instructors can teach her better than ourselves. Plus, the rate is lower than some similar schools. I strongly recommend it.<//review>

<review>I took my mother-in-law to all season driving school and she absolutely enjoyed every moment of it. She does not speak English very well but she said the instructors worked with her and were very kind to her and they taught her all she needed to know. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who's trying to learn how to drive for the first time they teach you everything from point a to point B what needs to be done what shouldn't be done and everything in between!!! I have this place five stars and if there is more stars I would give them more stars because I really appreciate everyone who helped us out and our journey of teaching my mother-in-law how to drive!! Thank you thank you so much</review></record></dataset><record>

This was an incredible driving experience for me. As someone who put off driving for multiple years and was very nervous to learn, Mr. Gosai did a great job teaching me how to drive. First, he taught me some tricks and tips of the road. He is very patient and really made sure I learn all the basics. Also, it's incredibly easy to text him to set up a lesson as he responds almost instantly.

I had my first permit about two years and tried to drive with another driving school, which I won't name. Huge Mistake. That instructor was very harsh and instantly criticized me for all my mistakes.

<Review>My 16 year old took 3 sets of 2 hours of instruction and just passed her driving test. So proud. I like the way the company confirms appointments, and is flexible with scheduling times. They even had her practice driving in the area of the DMV she was to take her test. Punctual and professional, what more could you ask for?</Review>< Gmap_id>

Instructor Jay was knowledgeable and was able to pan out the different situations to expect before we start driving. As we started along the road, he was able to point out the different junctions and scenarios that we went through earlier. Also appreciate the suggestion and advice given when I consulted on test location and dates. Thanks a lot!</text>

Super easy to learn with Gosai. I took just a one hour class before my driving test with him. He picked me up on time. Spent 20 mins going over the rules and explaining some tips. He was encouraging and relaxed. I passed the driving test. I highly recommend all season driving school.<//Review>

I just finished my lessons from this school. The instructor and the owner that I worked with were both great and friendly people. The owner would do all of the appointments and everything, and the driving instructor would always be there in time. The driving instructor was very knowledgeable, and gave me a lot of tips and pointers on how to drive. He was very friendly, always making some small talk so the 2 hour lessons didn’t feel like a chore. I really enjoyed these lessons and don’t have any complaints.<//review>

The instructors are all exceedingly friendly and top-tier. They are able to establish foundational driving knowledge almost instantly and are quick to provide constructive-criticism to the drivers. I am immensely self-confident in my personal driving coordination abilities and upcoming drivers test. Thank u All Season Driving School!!</text>

Best driving school experience ever!  I have two sons ages 16 and 19, my older son had a decent driving experience with a different driving school (which I won’t mention here) but I believe half of the success was due to my son already being an eager and confident driver.

My younger son is a different story, he was more nervous and less confident so I had to find the best school with the right instructor who would take their time and show my son how to drive with confidence.

Mr. Gosai was my son’s instructor and immediately after the first lesson, my son really enjoyed him and requested we only have him do the remaining lessons.  Mr. Gosai was patient, thorough and really made my son feel at ease.  He gave us really good and useful feedback and homework for my son to do in between lessons.  He was also very flexible in working with our busy schedules and always made us feel like a priority.

There are many driving schools to choose from but this one is the best if you want quality instructors who really care about their student drivers.  My son passed his drivers test in one try with a “good job!” On his score sheet from the DMV tester.</text>

The All Seasons Driving School has the best instructors. They are very calm, informative, and friendly. They are also very good with time schedules. They are flexible when it comes to scheduling, rescheduling, and cancelling appointments. Their instructors are always on time for their appointments. Overall, All Seasons Driving School is very accommodating and their service is worth every penny!< /Review>

I really appreciate this driving school. They are really cooperating if you have any questions they get right back to you and helps you. The website and activity of the units to learn is very good and educational to watch for you to learn. It's very convenient so I really suggest people really sign up because it's worth the cost.

<Review>Very good service overall.
Instructor caught my mistakes and hammered them down every time I would make them in a way that was not impolite nor irritating. He explained the mistake every time I made it and by the end of the lesson I had began to instinctively turning my head and scanning the surroundings more so than I had done previously. I would recommend this service to my friends and others who are looking for a driving school to do their 6 hours, or simply reviewing at.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Our initial experience with another driving school was very disappointing. The lady instructor preferred to be more on her phone, then paying attention to how the individual was driving. So, after some research and reviews we opted for All Season Driving School. My wife found Mr Singh to be an amazing instructor. First day he spent some time to understand what my wife needs to improve. He was always very interactive all throughout the driving sessions. He helped my wife to focus on the key areas needed to pass 'behind the wheel test'. Also, he made her drive quite a few times in and around the DMV. Ultimately, after 3 classes with Mr Singh my wife successfully cleared 'behind the wheel test' on her first attempt. I will highly recommend this driving school to others as well.< /text>

<Review>I would like to take few moments and write about how I really recommend All Season Driving School for your teenager not only the teachers are kind but they are very supportive and really understanding, scheduling with the owner was always flexible and the right fitting always finds a way to squeeze a lil practice in between which was really great cuz it helped a lot. My teacher Shalvin was awesome he taught me so much and so kindly that I didn't even wanted no one else to teach me but him he always arrived early and on time for sessions. He also explained every little things you need to know for your dmv test so I really recommend Shalvin as one of your teenagers driving teachers .< /Review>< pics>

We were fortunate enough to find Jay and All Season Driving School when my son, aged 16, needed additional driving practice. I found Jay easy to communicate with and to schedule lessons with but more importantly my son found him to be patient, clear and calm. He gave him plenty of practice around the area of the test center and gave him good driving experience as well as instruction on how to pass the test.
Jay went above and beyond though on my son’s test day. Due to our own error we had forgotten a critical piece of paper when we went to the test center. Jay completed the form and delivered it in time for my son to take his test, avoiding us having to reschedule (we all know how difficult that is) I have to repeat it was OUR MISTAKE not his, but he saved the day!
My son passed his test the first time with only one error. I would highly recommend Jay as a driving instructor.</text>

The price is great, the driving instructor is great, and most of all what I got out of the first our or so is great. Being really nervous at first made me make a few mistakes but as the lesson progressed I soon got the hang of things. Would definitely recommend to all my friends.<//text>

<name>isabel hsiao<//name><Resp>{'time': 1496544256994, 'text': 'Hi Isabel,\nThank you very much for taking the time to write a review for us. However, in order for us to give out the certificate of completion, the law requires driving schools to issue the certificate only after completing the required 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training, not after the 2nd lesson.\n\nWe strongly encourage students or parents to please email or call to make appointments for all 3 of their 2 hour lessons. Normally we provide some advanced techniques ("Do\'s and Dont\'s") to help students pass the DMV test in all lessons, and especially in the third lesson, which is typically taken just prior to the DMV test appointment. But during the driving lessons, we observe the student\'s progress and capability to drive before we start to have them use these advanced level skills which they may not be comfortable with.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience, but our number one priority is always the student\'s safety. We would be happy to help you finish your final class so we can complete your preparation for your driving test.'}<//Resp>< Time>

The person who taught me didn't give me the proof of the driver's course. He didn't respond for the third class either. Did not provide many tips for the driving test either as he fell asleep/ called other clients when I was driving.</Review>

Lessons are thorough and cover a lot of material. Unlike other drving schools all-season is efficient and doesn't waste a lot of time explaining just one little thing. They also show you the tricky areas around the dmv and tell you why people usually fail, so you are well prepared for the driving test. The price is also really good for the lessons you get.<//review>

I didn't pass the test but not because I was not tought well! I took the six hours behind the wheel lessons with all seasons. I got from 0 to almost good enough to take a car out on the road by my self. I am very greatful for the extra milles the instructor went to make me fit and the emotional support. Thank you so much and see you for the additional more practice :)< /Review>

<Review>I just wanted to let others know what I saw regarding the driver of Allseason driving school. I was driving in the night time and I noticed that there was a child sitting at the back without his safety belts. At first I thought I was mistaken as this was driving school car but when child stood up driver rather than telling the child to sit in his car seat pulled him to front and made child sit in front sit. We trust schools to teach our kid. If they can't follow rules what can they teach other kids.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>1< /Rating><resp>None<//resp><Name>Angie Lopes</Name><Time>1456830623487< /Time><user>107448267120098996784< /user><Gmap_id>0x808fc6176d5ea299:0xd5cd2a8d9935c29e</Gmap_id></record>

Such a great experience! Fast, courteous, and a great price. I was told by another shop that I would need to replace my exhaust for $1000. They patched it up for MUCH cheaper. Thank you!<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><resp>None</resp><Text>I was turned on to these guys, through a car guy friend of mine in town. I took my project into them to get the exhaust plumbed. Although they had a few work arounds and challenges. Jay and Chris knocked it out of the park. They did it quickly and professionally. They will get all of my future business. I couldn't be happier.
S.Dee

Top shelf work as usual. This is the 2nd time they have done the exhaust on one of my projects, and I couldn't be happier. Kris spent time listening to me explain what I was looking for in quality and sound. He made his recommendations and they where spot on. Saying he does sanitary work is an understatement. My Camaro sounds like it should now. If you need exhaust work done on your Hot Rod, or daily driver look no further.
Thanks again guys.<//Text>< Time>

#jnkmuffler is a Redding landmark.  Known for quality and professional service.  Chris is experienced and knowledgeable.  We wouldn't go any place else for exhaust related needs.<//Text>

Went in with an ex Australia leak expecting to spend some serious money and they put it on the rack at 430 in the afternoon and told me it was a small problem. Welded it up and sent me on my way free of charge... I recommend these guys to anyone with a prob big or small</Review>

The service was great, the beer was delicious and the prices were very reasonable. The Jamaica beer was excellent, but to be fair I would get all of their beers again.</text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dccd2af804e461:0x475055e74c65b4e2<//Gmap_id><Text>Second only to making my own beer at home, trying good beer and drinking at good craft breweries is pretty much my favorite thing in life. I try not to be snobby about it but I take my beer seriously. Personally, I would rate I&I brewing as the best craft brewery in the Inland Empire area of Southern California.
Their beers are divers and unique. No matter if you like big bold flavored beers or lighter more refreshing less “aggressive” beers, you will be able to find something that you like.
The staff is always helpful with directing customers towards a beer that suits their individual pallet. The brewer is incredibly talented at blending stiles and specialty ingredients. I have never been disappointed by a beer at I&I and there is a new beer on tap almost every time I go there.
The location is a small out of the way place and the atmosphere is super casual. You can sit at a counter out in the brewery, have conversations and enjoy your beer.
Perhaps not everyone agrees with me but I highly recommend giving I&I a try. Especially if you enjoy trying something unique and delicious that you probably can’t get anywhere ells.</Text><user>101438726369844595878< /user>< Pics>

They have a good variety of beers. A good place to hangout and chill for a couple of hours with your friends. Would not suggest for a large group as they do not have big tables. Lots of board games to play. I would have liked more if they had music playing.<//text>

When it's not crowded, it's a nice place to come and wind down with a couple beers. It was nice to come to a small brewery and get both the atmosphere of a small tucked away brewery, and the quality of beer of an established spot. Definitely worth returning to.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Great place for local craft beer. I & I always has a great vibe anytime you walk into the place. They also feature bands on certain days and great food trucks too. Chuck the brewer is legit. He knows tons about beer and is always fun to talk with. If you are in the neighborhood and looking for the local beer spot this is it.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>I'm sorry, I've been to at least 20 brewerys and I'm a huge beer drinker and have tried everything I can. Four of us brewery hoppers got a flight testing 6 of their quote "signature beers" and not one was good. I'm not leaving a bad review for consumers to see, but rather for the owners in hopes they see this review. This is my only 1 star on Google and as an avid drinker of beers, I would recommend to not to put so much sugar + whatever tasting additives you're using to get those flavors like root beer and margarita etc. We had high hopes but this was just a let down. Sorry guys.<//text><UserId.>115946395110276125748<//UserId.>< Name>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>I was stopping by on my way to a wedding to pick up a growler.  I called before and asked if they do growler fills, but when I came in they said they wouldn't fill my growler because it wasn't an I&I growler, you would think they would mention that over the phone...  I don't live in the area so there would be no reason for me to need a growler.  Anyways, I wanted to try there beer and share it with some people because that's what craft beer is about.  I did not feel like arguing because I was already late so I left.  The taproom seemed cool and I am sure the beer is fine too.  However I didn't feel the craft beer vibe they have going.  It would take quite a bit of convincing to come back here...< /Review><rating>2<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80dccd2af804e461:0x475055e74c65b4e2< /Gmap_id></record>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>After tasting several of their beers at beer festivals, I finally visited I&I. I stopped by on a Friday night close to last call (9pm) and the place was pretty packed. They have a small tasting room, so if you plan on visiting with a big group, be sure to get there early and claim your spot. As for the beers, I would say half of those on tap were good, while the others seemed to be more of an after thought. The tap list seemed to be cut short, so there may be more than the 15 beers (good offering) available on tap when I stopped by. Definitely worth a visit if you live near the area, but not the best when you have Sanctum and Claremont Craft not too far away.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Very disappointed. it was a nice set up, BUT #1),but, the people serving beers were rude, #2) they catered to the regulars there & could care less about first timers( we are waiting while they are letting regulars go behind the bar to get their own beers,#3) and their sample sizes might as well be served in a thimble(very stingy with samples & we felt rushed when we got our samples.), #4)very limited beer selection. This place has a lot of potential. Just feel it is very mismanaged.(I wonder if owner knows about people getting their own beers). Basically ,this is just a place for local regulars & not a serious brewery that shares the love. I am a one & done here !</review>

A small, air conditioned brewery with a laid back reggea vibe.  If your lucky, you might get some live music to go work your beer. They make a consistent batch of 16 beers of all different varieties and experiments. Some of our favorites are a Russian Imperial,  banana double, rootbeer double, jamica and a tangelo ale.  If you need some"good vibes" I&I is the place to find them in the IE.< /review>

I and I Brewing is a small local microbrew with an exellent selection, easy going vibe and a great ambience. The owners and operators are very chill peeps and they support certain small bands in a American reggae genre. Check it out.< /review>

< Review>
They have 20 beers on tap and give you tasters!

I had the pastrami sandwich and it was delicious.  They put coleslaw on the sandwich, which sounded weird, but it was a great complementary flavor.  It came with giant potato chips that were fresh, beautifully crispy, and tasty.  I think they'd just been fried.

Service was very prompt and attentive when needed.  Michael checked to make sure everything was OK and came when we were done to see if we wanted/needed anything else, which shows he kept a surreptitious eye on us.

So...delicious food and prompt service!< /Review>

My boyfriend and I walked in and walked out.

Neither of the 2 bar tenders even acknowledged us, the cook did.

There was a guy singing karaoke, sitting at a table.

The tables were dirty, grimmy, and it was a horrid cave that stank.

<rating>4<//rating><Text>The food was excellent as was the service. There was a variety of pastas available. Their wine list was huge. Best of all it didn't cost an arm and a leg to eat  there.The location was close to the Ahmanson as well as the Music Center and Disney Music Hall making it convenient to eat there and get to the performance on time.Would definitely recommend this place and eat there again.< /Text>< Pics>

Pretty good overall.
Large wine and beer selection although we don't drink so cannot comment much on that.
Nice atmosphere.
We came here on a Groupon which was a good deal but most likely wouldn't come here without a Groupon as the prices seem a bit high although in this area, I guess you pay more than inland areas.<//text>

Delicious BBQ hamburger with bacon and huge onion ring. It was huge and tastes great! Also, "Brix romaine salad" with candied walnuts and grapes and apples was exceptionally delicious!</text>

<Text>We came out see our friend Bill perform with his band.  First time to this wine bar, they are in the midst of changing ownership so seems a bit understaffed.  However, service was courteous and friendly.

It was a nice group of us coming to see Bill.  Music was awesome, by the way.  We got lucky and sat at the last seats available at the bar.  Definitely my preferred seating location.  Good view of the musicians. Good accessibility to the bartenders too!

We had a few glasses of wine each.  Ordered the sautéed mushrooms and toasted baguette, but that night they served with pita bread which was good anyway.

Also ordered the coconut shrimp with sweet and sour sauce.  Tasty.

Probably should have ordered like a burger or something, because I definitely drank more than I ate.  (Yes, we did take lyft here!  Don't drink and drive!!)

We also had a good beer to top off our evening.  It was something peanut buttery.  WOW.  Good stuff.  Need to come back for beer nite.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjU3fCqR6zfa5C3HBd-Ompzu3HbiIiIQGOqf2E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd0Ewjk5Jde8HeuY08ADaFpoinig2OIvmxPxj8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd257328cab105:0xf9909b352e2871b2<//Gmap_id></record>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Excellent service!  Wonderful wines!  We enjoyed the wine tasting and the sommelier was helpful, and fun....but the reason it's getting four and not five stars is the cheese plate.  Ugh....the cheese plate, if you're serving wine and offer a cheese plate, please make the effort.  The "candied nuts" should be added to the plate when serving, not on the previously prepared plate that is sitting in the refrigerator, they get soggy.  The dried fruits should also be added when you're ready to serve so you can actually bite them without breaking teeth.  Also maybe add some honey and crackers....it is, after all, a cheese plate....with wine...All of that said, we'll definitely be going back!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Happy hour pricing isn't that happy.  Staff is friendly, but service was slow the night we were there (probably our fault as our group doubled the crowd).

The atmosphere is dark and pretty uncomfortable. If you like the food here cool, but I had the worst pastrami sandwich I've ever had here. It tasted as if the meat had been bought a week ago and it was still being used, and the coleslaw in the sandwich also seemed old and discoloured. They may be good on some day but today was quite bad</Text>

Had a burger and a beer happy hour special.  Enjoyed both. I was actually surprised how good the burger was.  Good selection of craft beers.  Service was good too. I'd go back.< /Review>

<resp>None< /resp><review>0 stars. Waited almost an hour after ordering to receive our food. It was lunch time and not that busy. Garlic fries were soaked in oil. They were a soggy mess. BBQ bacon burger had no bacon and very little flavor. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to wait another hour.  Other guests were not happy either. The manager said they were waiting on a delivery and were out of stuff. It's a new owner and she appeared to not know what was going on or cared. What was once an $8 beer 3 months ago is now $11. We will not be back.< /review></record>

Food was good. Had a Buddah  bowl. Poor guy running the places was alone. That's right, one server for Sunday at lunchtime. He kept his cool, was gracious and did his best.< /text>

My boyfriend and I went there for lunch today. The wings were ok. My boyfriend had the fish and chips, which was good. I had the steak sandwich... the chef must have thought I was a vampire or something because ALL I could taste was garlic. I must’ve ate 5 garlic cloves in just half of the sandwich. The aioli sauce had no flavor other than garlic. She also over cooked the steak. Sucks because it was a really long wait to get our food in the first place.

Our waiter was great, although he was the only waiter/bar tender in the whole restaurant. Service was pretty slow, but it wasn’t his fault. They need to hire more wait staff.</Review>

This place seems to be hit or miss. I enjoyed my burger but the other burger at the table was overdone. The chips they come with were tasteless and greasy. Pastrami sandwich was good but the tomato bisque was spicy for some reason?? Chicken strips were overcooked and mostly breading but the garlic fries were amazing. They also ran out of several menu items and we were there before the lunch rush.
Server was very friendly but service itself was slow. Entrees all came out at different times (even the burgers which youd think would be cooked simultaneously). Took forever to get the check. And with how little seating is inside you'd think theyd want to move people as quickly as possible to make room for the next guests.</text>

Cozy, quaint local "hole in the wall" wine bar with amazing and friendly staff. Live music can be enjoyed at least 4x a week. Do yourself a favor and visit on Wine Tasting nights! You're welcome!</Text>

Great place with good selection of beers on tap. Burgers and sandwiches are amazing. The garlic fries are a little HEAVY on the garlic for my taste, so I stick with the normal fries or chips. Would recommend to anyone!<//Review>

Casual, friendly, good service, delicious food. The made fresh garlic fries, a delicious side to the best ever Hot Pastrami sandwiches are my favorite. Great menu. Good wine and beer selection. Entertainment usually Thursday thru Sunday. Paint night's are fun. Our favorite go to place when in the area.<//review>

< Review>
I attended a Mother's Day plant night at Brix. Although I enjoyed the company and I enjoyed the project that we made at the plant night. I was not impressed by the service or the food. The service by the one gentleman that seem to be waiting on our entire area was good. He was as efficient as could be expected. But I just feel that they were understaffed for the amount of people that were in attendance. I had chicken strips and they were not good and one of my big gripes about restaurants that sell chicken strips is how stingy they are with the ranch dressing! If you spend $13 for chicken strips you could expect to get a little more than a half a cup of ranch dressing that's as thin as water. I personally appreciate the people that I was with and the project, but again I was unimpressed with Brix and have no intention of returning there. However, my brother dies live 2 blocks ( walking distance) from Brix... If He suggests going there sometime, I just may give it another try. But that's only if my brother suggests it!<//Review>

Great sandwiches. They offer Groupon discounts regularly. I've been for lunch, but it looks like evenings have music, wine tastings and more. Parking is free although limited.< /text>

Brix has a lot to offer. They have great beer and wine lists. It's a very repaved relaxed place that frequently features local musicians. The food doesn't disappoint either.  I'd imbibe more of it weren't for the prices.< /Text>

<Text>Cool little bar right on the border of sunset and huntington beach... they have an amazing selection of beers on tap and really tasty food for a decent price. On wednesdays they have a comedy open mic night which is tons of fun! Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a chill place to pick up a beer.<//Text>< pictures>

A beer and wine bar where the staff doesn't know anything about wine. This is a great spot if you love really good beer, but move on if you're looking to explore new wines... The staff can't help.< /text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>The restaurant it self was ok. Nice little chick place. The service average. The food was so disappointing.  We ordered a couple of burgers with fries. We got a a burger with sandwich bread and instead of fries we got potatoe chips. I would have liked to be advised of it before I ordered to make another desicion. Nothing was done to compensate the issues.  Not that we expected anything for free but the least that they could have done was apologize and not charged us for the order of fries we ordered which came with our burgers. Will not go to this place again sorry.  Gave it a 3 star because painting class was ok.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I attended a plant night here with some of my girlfriends from work.  The venue is easy to find just off of PCH, limited parking in front but tons of spots in behind. The service in the Brix was great, staff were fast and friendly, the food was tasty; a good time was had by all! Will be back!!!<//review>

An absolutely phenomenal dining experience.  This was our first time here and we will most certainly return often! We both had the pastrami sandwich with garlic fries and were absolutely floored with the flavors and presentation! Bravo Brix Sunset Beach!!<//Text>

MG Club of So Cal stopped by to eat after one of our outings. i didn't know what to expect but found the surrounding inviting and homey. The hamburger my wife split was more than enough and extremely tasty, so much that we are going back tonight for more. We ordered sweet potatoe fries as part of our meal but another club member ordered potato chips. Those potato chips were home made - not too thin, crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. Another reason we are going back again, they were  the best I've ever. The atmosphere friendly, waitress witty and funny with pleasant disposition.< /Text>

Great food and service

Just a little skeptical when the health inspector came while I was eating and drinking my beer.

And the server stating they were trying to shut them down.

Going to give them another shot anyways</Text>< Gmap_id>

Husband and I had the house-made potato chips, onion rings, Brix salad plus beer and wine. Everything was very well done; chips crispy, onion rings perfect and the salad had a deft touch. My only critical remarks would be to remove the hand painted sign outside and straighten up the outside patio. Service was very friendly and it's a half block from Sunset Beach.< /Text>

The food was amazing as usual. The music coming out of the speakers. .not so much. The Fuhhgetaboutit. .is always a culinary orgasm. . I tried the Chipotle chicken burger with garlic fries and it was incredible. .but I will go back to the pastrami gastrointestinal experience next time.< /Text>

Went here with my bf after trying to go to another place but, it was too crowded. He remembered the original owners and thought I should check it out.
We went to see that there was a 3 person band about to play soon. I had the veggie burger and he had the Forgetaboutit. We shared the garlic fries.
The food was good, the band was good, singing classics like Dolbey Grey's "Drift Away" and it was a nice experience. Will go back there again.<//text>

Great little wine bar, (and a good selection of beer too)! This is the original spot - the owner has now opened a Brix on 2nd in Belmont Shores too. Music on the wine side, couple of TVs on the beer side. I have discovered some great wine here.<//review>

The venue is much too small to have live, amplified music. The menu has some really nice items, but most of it is overpriced. It would appear that the chef expects you to eat the food as prepared, because you have to ask for salt and pepper at the table!<//Text>

Happy hour is the way to do it - garlic fries were amazing - excellent beer and wine selection. Did not enjoy the mahi mahi tacos (they were bland) but the calamari was perfect and the Caesar salad very enjoyable. Service was excellent.</review>

Advertised open mic til 11 - closed it down early so we missed the comic we came to see. Advertised happy hour all night - didn't honor it and had no explanation as to why and simply handed me the bill trying to rush us out.< /Text>

I have always had such a great experience at Brix.  The staff is very knowledgeable and will help you find the right beer or wine.  However it can be very crowded and it is a little expensive.< /Text>

Brix is an awesome place for good food and drinks. My personal favorites are the Cobb Boss (think cob salad on a sandwich) or the Pastrami on Rye.</text>

Food was ok... not great, but ok for pub grub.  Craft beer selection was very good.  Ambience was ok.  Didn't try wine bar which isseparate yet connected to bar. I may try that another time.  I wouldnt give the bar another try and I like  a good neighborhood bar.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) good attention, but the music does not start at the scheduled time .. the beach is a few meters in the back of the restaurant, the place has little parking but you can leave the car in the depths, you should see the working hours for to be able to do it

(Original)
buena atención, pero la musica no inicia a la hora programada.. la playa esta a pocos metros en la parte de atrás del restaurante, el lugar cuenta con poco parqueo pero puedes dejar el auto en las profundidades, somo debes ver el horario hábil para poder hacerlo< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Very great customer service! We were greeted and welcomed very warmly. Our agent, Shaun, was the most pleasant salesperson I’ve ever had to deal with. He was very polite, helpful, knowledgeable and very honest. He was able to help us work out a good deal. The entire process went so smoothly. I would like to thank Shaun and his manager for helping us get the car that we wanted. I highly recommend Pacific Honda for giving such great customer service.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Yesterday I purchased a 2021 Honda Odyssey touring lunar silver with mocha interior from pacific Honda. Overall I had a good experience shopping with pacific Honda, and everyone on the team was professional and friendly. Our salesman Davian, was “the new guy” but was able to help us with what we needed and ended up showing us a car, that we wouldn’t have even looked at, which we ended up buying. We also worked with Andrea and JR, both managers, who worked with us and happily gave us what we needed. Tarig helped us with the final closure and paperwork of the purchase and he was wonderful! He was friendly, easygoing and very knowledgeable about the car and helped to show us how to connect our phones etc. Tonya with finance was quick, even though she had been working with a new system and getting familiar with it. What I really appreciated the most with the staff at pacific Honda was that no one talked bad or put down other car brands or competitors, or felt the need to flex the Honda muscle. Overall it was a positive experience and I would recommend buying from pacific Honda.< /Text>< Pics>

We came in on a Saturday evening to look at CRVs. Prior to my visit I researched online and had an idea of what I wanted, but was only interested in seeing the cars. At the dealership we were helped by Ryan. Ryan was extremely professional and took the time to develop a rapport with us. He was helpful, knowledgeable, and didn't press the sale. We came in the next day (his day off) and purchased the car. It was a great car buying experience. Thanks Ryan!< /review>

Was nervous as a first time car buyer, but my salesmen Gregory Allen and Richard Choi made the whole experience super easy and reassuring. They were very knowledgeable, transparent, and very sweet!

Their parts department across the street was also super cool when I went to get accessories. Gave me a sweet new car buyer discount on everything.

Had been to a different honda dealership a week prior in my car hunt and this trip just showed how different and great Pacific Honda was service and atmosphere wise.

I’d also like to thank Andrea at pacific honda for following up a week later from my initial inquiry to tell me the harder to find sonic grey pearl color I was looking for had just arrived on the lot.

Super in love with my Honda Civic Hatchback! This color is absolutely gorgeous. Looks matte in the shade and has a sparky rainbow shine in the light! 🥰<//review>

The service that I received at Pacific Honda was excellent. Each employee I encountered was friendly and helpful. I wasn't over sold. Communication was easy and consistent. The process of actually purchasing my new car was quick and painless. A good friend of mine purchased a car from a Ford dealer about the same time I did, and had exactly the opposite experience. It gave me a good comparison. Thank you Pacific Honda!</Text>

<Date>1621985971769<//Date><rating>2<//rating><Text>We went in for a maintenance service and was greeted nicely by Brandon. He estimated 2 hours and said he'd text us as soon as it's finished. However, we waited for more than 3 hours with no status update or any follow up from anybody. When we finally decided to ask what's going on (after seeing our car parked in the parking lot!), the cashier woman was pretty much throwing her hands in the air-none of her business attitude. We were directed to the express service for whatever reason, and of course the cashier person over there was not interested in helping us either. Bryan was helpful, though, and eventually told us to wait by Brandon's desk. Apparently Brandon went for lunch and our paperwork was just sitting on his desk.. The girl sitting next to him was kind enough to help us bring it to the (same rude) cashier woman. And that was the end of it. Shouldn't someone else step in if someone went for lunch, instead of keeping the customer waiting for hours? Some employees are good here but some are in no business of serving people.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1622018360305, 'text': 'Hi, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.

Excellent dealership, very good service and attention. Jimmy was a great salesman throughout the whole experience, he was helpful, really walked us over all the options we had as far as inventory and financing.
All the management staff was also super helpful, and everyone was very patient about us being there with my two toddlers running around for a bit.</review>

If you're looking to use a True Car cash offer- look no further!

Don Herborn at Pacific Honda is 100% the way to go! I even goofed on my title (signed in the wrong spot) and he and his team took care of it!
I was in and out in less than 40 minutes!
The courtesy Uber home was a major bonus as well.

Don answered my texts with perfect etiquette and was just overall amazing.

Thank you, Don. I really appreciate everything you've done for my family. This truly was a flawless experience.< /review>

< Review>
I was very pleased with the service I received at Pacific Honda, starting with the terrific customer service over the phone when I set up the appointment. As it was my first visit (after years of going to another Honda Service location), I have to admit that I was a bit nervous about the level of service I'd receive.  When I checked in, I shared my most recent service records and was told the car was due for an oil change and, if necessary, tire rotation.  It was determined that the latter wasn't needed, so my bill was not as high as estimated.  I appreciated the honesty and efficiency displayed.</Review>

I was issued a factory coupon, directly from Honda, for my A13 service that reduced the price of my service call by 68%. The service representative was very respectful when I arrived 30 minutes early for my appointment. He took me right away, explained the service call, provided an estimate for the effort, and commended me for bringing the factory coupon (no double speak). The service technician completed the service call within the estimated time.  The entire effort exceeded my expectations. I'm not surprised because my Honda vehicle has exceeded my expectations every day since I drove it off the lot in 2017.<//text>

I called Pacific Honda and they had the exact car there. They gave me a quote $50/mo less on a lease even on the phone. I went I got the car from Pacific Honda the next day.

<Review>the service was fine, and my car repairs were completed. But the follow communication from Pacific Honda was nonexistent, the rental car company to which they sent me for a free loaner car tried to sell me on the need to purchase additional insurance coverage, and the fact that they left my insurance and registration documents scattered on the passenger side floorboard did not sit well with me. Additionally, they never called to give me an update on when/if my car was ready for pick up, as they said they would. I had to call them the following morning to get a status update. I have now left several messages for a manager to call me, and I have not received a call back.<//Review>< pictures>

Great car buying experience at Pacific Honda!  Dario and Richard were polite, professional and a pleasure to work with.  One of the best experiences I have had at a car dealership.  I highly recommend Pacific Honda for anyone wanting to buy a Honda.< /Text>

I absolutely love my new vehicle! This is a good dealership! The only problem I had with them was that they chipped my windshield while getting it ready for me to drive off the lot and they plugged it to keep it from running instead of replacing it. That would have been OK if it wasn't so noticeable. I figured the amount of money I spent on my new car would have caused them to replace my windshield instead of doing a patch job. Now I'm paying to have my windshield replaced after having the car less than a week.</text>

The people at Pacific Honda took good care of my car and me when I brought it in to be serviced. I received a great deal for an oil change so I could afford the other services they suggested (i.e., changing my cabin filter and replacing my wipers). All of the staff members were just as professional as always and they explained all of the charges and services to me in plain, understandable English.< /text>

From there I was handed to Shawn, another salesman who took my experience to another level. Shawn made sure I was comfortable with the purchase and to this day has had outstanding follow-up. Based on Shawn's ability to connect with his customer and exceed their expectation, I referred (2) of my co-workers to him who also made purchases of new vehicles. Both of them are very happy as well. Another friend has an appointment this week with Shawn and I will continue to send anyone looking for a vehicle to him. Being that I'm a huge Honda fan and have purchased several over the years, I must say that by far Pacific Honda has been the best experience I've had with any Honda Dealership in the Country. 20 STARS for Shawn!!! It's also important to note that JR helped me find solutions while in Finance and the GM I spoke with (don't have his name) was also extremely helpful when I hit a snag with the deal. I could go on and on saying great things about my experience with Shawn, but I think you get my point here!!!< /review>< date>

No issues on the routine service I did. I felt that I was pressured into buying their "membership card", which they call a PAC card. If they try to sell one to you on the spot, just tell them you need some time to think about whether it would be worth it for yourself before buying. No harm done to me, because I managed to get a refund after explaining that it turns out it wouldn't be worth it for me.<//review>

<review>I must say Pacific Honda on convoy Street was the best experience and a car dealership I’ve ever had everybody was hands-down the most friendliest nicest sincere customer service I’ve ever had when it comes to buying cars! I would personally like to thank everybody from Jeff who was my sales rep, Shella who was the insurance agent on site, Mark who was the senior sales rep, and Fred who was the financial manager who sealed the deal on my purchase!

I also wanna say thank you to Shane who  is my Allstate agent for my previous car and will be my agent for this new car....Shane was the one who referred me to them! Thank you All for treating me and my wife like a queen I will definitely be referring people to Pacific Honda on convoy!

Purchased a 2021 Honda CR V Hybrid from Pacific Honda on March 5th. I committed a good deal of time researching and comparing vehicles across brands in the various SUV categories I was considering. Spent many weekends perusing lots, test driving vehicles, and haggling with sales guys.

At Pacific Honda I finally saw the CR V that I simply had to have. They pulled it off the showroom floor to let me test drive. Long story short, I bought it. Gerardo helped answer all my questions and made the purchasing process seamless. He was friendly, informative, and easy going. I didn't feel pressured at all and the sticker price on my vehicle was lower at Pacific Honda than prices I'd seen at other San Diego County Honda dealilerships. None of the usual sully fees that many dealerships love to squeeze onto the bottom line!  I would definitely consider purchasing another vehicle from Pacific Honda and would recommend contacting Gerardo directly for a pleasant car shopping experience.< /Text>< Time>

Very courteous, upfront with the costs which seemed reasonable based on previous maintenance done by other shops.  Car was done on time.  I would recommend to other Honda owners with no reservations.<//review>

< Review>
Helpful and considerate service Personel (5 stars) Value for dollars paid (1 star). My 2013 Honda Insight battery was low and required a jump start. I accomplished this with a portable jump starter.
A few days later I went to get a smog check. Car failed smog check due to a failure code related to low battery.
Brought car to Pacific Honda to fix failure code. $158 to clear failure code. Obtained some advice from Pacific Honda relative to procedural dance required to to get the car ready for a smog re-test.
This requires at least 15 cold starts (less than 120 degrees coolant temp) then ten minutes to warm up. Driving for 50 to 200 miles at varying speeds.
I am still researching how to keep the battery charged while I am away. Hopefully won’t have to be too concerned until next smog test. Also looking to get a connector to check the codes myself or finds more reasonable service provider for future codes.
I am disappointed with honda for designing this low battery response behavior into their vehicle controllers.<//Review>

The worst car buying experience I’ve had. Came in to the dealership at 6 pm knowing exactly what I wanted and it took over 5 hours to get out of the dealership with no test drive. 3 days later I was called and told I had to drive all the way back to the dealership to fill out additional paperwork (release of liability, etc) that the finance guy didn’t fill out properly.. 1 week later.. I find keys to other cars from the dealership in the back seat of my car...3 weeks later I receive a call from my credit union stating the dealership had just sent the payoff check and it was not sufficient to cover the loan payoff amount that was stated upon signing the contract.  After calling the dealership multiple times and leaving multiple voicemails with no response I drive down to the dealership a second time to get this taken care of. When I show up.. 2 finance specialists are sitting at their desks in front of 0 customers, but apparently everyone was too busy to return any calls or voicemails.

I finally talk to the finance manager and he is unable to resolve the issue. I was told the finance director Samantha would call me first thing the next morning to resolve the issue.

Of course, no call was returned and no response from the dealership. I called 11 more times and still no response.

Meanwhile, interest continues to build on a vehicle I traded in weeks ago and the dealership continues to drag there feet because they already received their money for the new car I purchased.

I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. Honestly, I would give this car back to them and pay more to buy from someone else if I could. Very poor management.< /text>

Fabulous and fast service at the Honda service department. From the ladies who scheduled my appointment to My service man Brandon. They take covid precautions and had my car repaired and the oil change hours ahead of schedule.   Brandon was my service manager that day he was polite educated on my matter , gave me a text to let me know my car was completed and ready to go . Once I got there gave me a briefing on the services provided and walked me to my car . Best service yet .  Thanks Brandon and pacific Honda service department for making it a painless experience.<//Review>

Good sales staff. Worked with me for my first time purchasing a vehicle from a dealership... but when I brought the truck in for an oil change, instead of doing the work themselves, they sent the truck to a cheap, sub-contracted shop where they dropped the truck off the lift... DROPPED IT OFF THE LIFT. While it wasn’t directly the dealership, I left my truck in their hands and unfortunately got back a lesser truck.</review>

I have been struggling to buy a car for the longest time. I went to multiple dealerships and I always felt like they tried to sell me stuff I don’t need. Once I walked into Honda’s pacific I was treated amazingly. Davian Rivera was just the perfect guy to go to. He listend to everything I said and payed close attention on what I wanted. He made to entire process an unforgettable event for me. It was my first time buying a car and I highly recommend this place. All the stuff members are very knowledgeable and nice. I am so happy with everything I have experienced and I cannot complain at all. If you are looking to buy a new car Davian is the man to go. I would like to take this opportunity and see a big thank you to him and the team of the Honda Pacific dealership. Thank you for making this The best car purchase I have experienced so far.</text>

Information when calling to get in was right on target. The Quick Service Department listened to what concerns I had and checked it all out along with doing the safety checks and oil change and got back to me with their findings.
The gentleman at the front desk of the Quick Service Department was thorough and very courteous.
All-in all, a good experience.
Thank you Pacific Honda, once again,

Outstanding customer service by Service Advisor Gabriel Alvarado.  He explained, in simple terms, what my car needed and didn’t need, found me a ride home during my wait, kept me posted on progress, and applied generous coupons, even though I wasn’t sure which ones applied.</review>

<review>I haven't owned a Honda for over 6 years now, so this is my first experience in a while. Took my new (to me) 2015 Honda Accord in for it's 100k service and was blown away by the over-the-top service of everyone involved. In particular was Jerremie, who coordinated the service, made sure everything was taken care of and communicated everything to me in a timely manner. I am now even more excited about my Honda purchase to be "back in the family" with Honda service!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1613466733327, 'text': 'Hi Josh, we strive for 100% satisfaction, and it is great to see you had such a positive experience at Pacific Honda.

<Review>Very bad service. I made the mistake of taking ownership of the car before they completed all their work on it. There was a dent and they owed me some treatments. Of course once I paid I was invisible to Dario, the salesman who sold me the car. He kept me and my family waiting 30 minutes while he finished a sale, my calls and emails went unanswered, and I got the runaround. Bottom line, don’t trust these guys. That probably does not need to be said about a car dealer, but I’ll say it again—don’t trust them.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Gabriel A. helped me and my adult daughter (her Accord now) from start to finish. He was EXTREMELY helpful! He was very patient with us (adult daughter's first time at at a service center), explained everything clearly, was very careful and understanding of keeping distanced and keeping a mask on (with Covid 19), and went over everything in great detail, especially for my daughter to understand for future services, even though it was the very end of the day. He allowed us to stay outside the entire time, even for payment, due to our concerns with Covid.

As the car was sitting in a garage for 4 months during the pandemic and was filthy, he was kind enough to wash it when I asked - even twice -because it was so dirty, even though this isn't a usual service provided.

Gabriel was an A+++++, 10++++++ Service Member at Pacific Honda in SD. He was really professional, helpful, and went above and beyond the call of duty. My daughter is now living in SD (changing from a Northern CA Honda Service Center) and will definitely be returning to Pacific Honda for all of her servicing needs. This is because Gabriel was so, so awesome as our Service Advisor. I can't thank him enough for the whole positive experience!<//Review>

Milad had told us he was new and had just started working there, but that wasn’t the case it felt if he was there for a long time and knew how to talk with customers. He helped us get the Honda we wanted and our favorite color “Silver” (Honda Accord 2.0T Sport)

Mark the manager came out of the office and gave us a number that we couldn’t turn down. No back and forth number games. Mark was straight up with us and the numbers were something we could work with considering our budget.

Finance Anthony Taing was profesional and got us out of there in a jiffy. Offered us what we needed and explained everything thoroughly. There was no gimmicks and everything was straight forward.

Based on our experience, we was thinking about going to trade our  2016 Honda Civic and get into another 2020 Accord !!! Best experience and they were mindful due to Covid-19 everything was clean and the environment was friendly. We felt safe and welcomed.

We could not had ask for more, let me know if you could give me a good deal trading in my Civic and we will be back next week!!

Thank you Pacific Honda for your professionalism, humbleness, humility and friendly atmosphere.

Kind regards,,

From start to finish this was a problem free experience. Check in was relatively quick and I was informed of a timeline on when my car would be done. I had several recalls that had to be fixed and a few little issues that needed to be taken care of. I’m very pleased with the service provided by the Honda Service center.</review>

<Review>In the past, I never liked the process of purchasing a vehicle, it's cumbersome and inefficient. However, in this case, I had a great experience with Tony Nguyen and his associates at Poway Honda. They were upfront and honest and we were out of there relatively quickly with a very good deal and a brand new Honda Accord. The Finance department is also very efficient and utilizes a hand-held device for electronic signatures that saves you a lot of time and headaches.</Review>< Pictures>

Having purchased from another Honda dealer for years, I decided to stop by Pacific and check them out as my lease was expiring.  I was amazed how large their inventory was and how quickly we could make a great deal happen.  Great "trade in" on my over the limit lease, Lowered my payment, nothing out of pocket and got it all done in record time.  THANKS!</Text>

Tarig was very knowledgeable and patient with us throughout the purchasing process in answering all our questions regarding the vehicle.

I have taken my car to Pacific Honda for the past 7 years. I needed brakes. I called in and asked for someone to call me back twice to get an estimate. No reply. I decided to make an appointment on line for Nov 30. I arrived and was told the appointments are not helpful. They work on a first come, first serve basis. ( I thought that was only for oil changes.) Why offer appointments then?  I agreed to pay $90 to diagnose the brakes up front. Would go to brake repair if I proceeded. Two an half hours later I was told what was needed. Way too expensive. I declined. They returned my car with grease on my armrest and seat. 30 minutes later the car was returned cleaned. I lost 3 hours and $90. Lesson learned. I would have appreciated a call back last week. If appointments don't help the customer, don't offer them. The sales associate was polite.< /Review>

With the shortage of microchips right now, it's an extremely tough time to find a new car to lease, especially a hybrid SUV. Even though Honda had a slight advantage (with so much competition to secure a vehicle), it still seemed like we were able to work out a good lease deal, trading in our 3 year-old CRV (which had a good amount of equity--yay for Hondas) for a CRV hybrid touring model. Ryan was extremely helpful in alerting us to the CRV hybrids that had just arrived on the lot and super patient throughout the negotiation process. My husband keeps saying our new car is the best car he's ever had. It's pretty much everything we wanted in a car for a good price. AND, because it's a Honda, we expect it to hold value better than most other cars so we can do this all over again in 3 years.</review>

We recently had the good fortune to work with Jeff McPike at Pacific Honda.  We have previously purchased two Hondas and also LOVE the service department at Pacific Honda.
Jeff was helpful, courteous, patient and knowledgeable.  He allowed us plenty of time (weeks) to evaluate our options and sincerely wanted us to make the best decision for our needs.  I would highly recommend working with Jeff at Pacific Honda.
We visited quite a number of other car dealerships.  In our experience we   found Jeff's manner and salesmanship to be TOPS.  He is a gentleman and a professional and a pleasure to work with.</Review>

I went to see a car that I wanted to see if it looked as good as it did on line. Lenny and Martin assisted me and were very professional  and answered my questions. The car looked better in person and now after seeing car in person I couldn't leave the lot without  it. I am happy to say I am a proud owner of this vehicle.
Thanks you Lenny and Martin
Much appreciated

I would recommend Pacific Honda to all my friends and family. I have purchased many vehicles in the past and by far this was one of the easiest purchases. The sales person was very friendly and not pushy. They gave me a fair trade in value and the finance person made it very easy.< /review>

<text>Not knowing the first thing about having or buying a new car I went in the Honda Dealership totally lost.  My representative was Richie Inzunza.  I left feeling I was an expert on Honda's 😁.  His professional expertise,  compassion , knowledge and genuine  concern of what would be my preference and what would work for me and the how's to work it with financial aspects was outstanding.  I felt totally secure, happy, joyous, and with a depth of appreciation.   Richard you made buying this vehicle a highlight of my life.  I've never had a brand new car.  I am bringing my friend in so you can assist her in a purchase.   Such a blessing I was favored this day.<//text>< Resp>

I would 100% recommend doing your car shopping at Pacific Honda! Super friendly and accommodating throughout the entire process. This was my first time buying a car on my own and I want to thank my sales consultant Manny for taking the time to answer all of my questions, Samantha for walking me thru the financial process and Geraldo for helping me retrieve my Tame Impala CD I left in the disc tray of my trade-in! Hopefully you replaced your "Slash" CD from your old Jaguar! Theres just some albums you can't live without. Regardless of who you interact with at Pacific Honda, you will know that you came to the right place. 5/5. -DF</review>

<review>I am happy with the buying process since Jojie and other staffs were friendly and helped me set up everything (insurance, finance, etc.). I would give 4.5 stars for purchasing experience but minus 1 for post-sale customer service, as their sales manager refused to refund me for the KARR alarm which I wanted to remove after purchase. That means I signed $595 for an unwanted product while it is actually removable if you buy a car and get this add-on from other dealerships.

I will recommend this place if you have worked as a car dealer or have completely researched buying a car and knowing every trick a dealer will have. I think the staffs here are really friendly and willing to help you. Remember not to buy any optional add-ons since you can come back to buy them, but it's hard to remove them after you signed because the sales manager will not be happy to talk about this. This also applies to all car dealers.</review><user>105569831513374230223</user>< time>

I bought my wife a Civic from Lawrence back in 2017. I had a great experience and decided to return to look for a car for myself. I needed a commuter car and saw an ad for a 2014 Accord coupe. Called in and spoke to Richard, he said he’d be there whenever I was ready to go test drive. We went for a test drive and decided to move forward with purchasing. What I really liked about both Lawrence and Richard was that they weren’t pushy, had patience and were willing to brainstorm with us trying to figure out how to make or budget work. My wife and I had 2 pleasant experiences now. I definitely recommend checking out Pacific Honda and speaking with Lawrence and Richard, 2 seasoned and knowledgeable guys.< /review>

No one ever likes being rear ended and having your loyal commuter car totaled. We were put in that unfortunate situation but Pacific Honda made the situation brighter. Chris Celis previously helped us at another dealership closer to our home, but we drove all the way out to Pacific Honda to see him for his top notch service. We were going back and forth between a couple models and Chris' extensive knowledge of Hondas helped in our decision making. Chris is a genuine salesperson who has your best interest at heart. Chris and his Sales Manager were able to get us an amazing deal. Ms T in finance had the most sincere and positive attitude that was the cherry on top. Highly recommend Chris Celis and Pacific Honda if you are ever in the market for a vehicle.< /review>

I was at Pacific Honda because my daughter was purchasing her leased Accord. She loves the car and couldn’t part with it. Her salesman Ryan was so helpful and easygoing. Talk about no pressure, Ryan is like anti-venom to pressure salesmen. His no problem,
Can do attitude was what you would love to have on your side when making a car purchase. He kept making the deal sweeter and sweeter till we had big smiles on our faces. Thanks Ryan. By the way, the next day I was offered such a good deal on my older Accord, I drove home with a new one. Love them Accords.< /text>

Went to Pacific Honda again this week and this time we traded in our Civic and Milad was able to get us in an Accord Touring. The price was right and the atmosphere was friendly. The manager and fiancé personnel were awesome. I couldn’t ask for more. Everyone was friendly and and but the reason why we go there is because of honesty. We drove almost two hours just to purchase from them. We purchased two Accords in less than a week. I recommend Pacific. Honda and their staff are so helpful. Thanks again Milad !!!

Kind regards,

Ko and Iliana< /Text>

<Date>1618527019755< /Date><rate>1< /rate><review>We purchased a car with a financing option on March 21st, signed a contract and 25 days later, we received a call saying the bank did not approve the loan so they want to increase the rate. A classical yo-yo scam. We told them that they need to honor the rate on the signed contract but they were unwilling so we offered to cancel the contract, on a condition that they take back the car at their own expense, which they refused. This could have been avoided if they acted on a timely manner and raised this issue sooner. The contract stipulates that the Seller must send a written notice within 10 days of the contract date if they wish to cancel. When we brought this to the finance manager's attention, her tone changed immediately and threatened to reposes the car with a caveat, "it's going to hurt your credit." Poor business practice. Certainly not something we were expecting from an authorized Honda dealer.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Unfortunately does not follow social distancing protocols so felt a bit uncomfortable during my time there. The person helping me got shoulder to shoulder when I was trying to pull the car I wanted up on my phone. When I tried backing away nonchalantly, they just got closer - again shoulder to shoulder. Also they gave me a handshake. I know they were trying to be friendly and that this is trivial, but it made me uncomfortable given the pandemic and I didn’t want to deny it and seem rude. Lastly when they showed me around, they were extremely close to me as well. It was so hard to back away from them without seeming rude. They just got closer each time. Overall friendly, but no personal space whatsoever. I wish they took social distancing more seriously.< /review>

10/10 Highly Recommend! Ryan Soliman, he put every effort he could into getting me the car I needed at an affordable price. He made me feel welcomed and was very supportive and patient when I couldn't make up my mind. Awesome guy overall! Him and his team made my process go by so quick also, I was pretty shocked how fast I was able to walk out with my vehicle. You guys are incredible! Thank you so much for everything Ryan!</Text>

<Text>I bought a used car at Pacific Honda. Overall I had a good experience starting from negotiation to after sales service with Austin Bryson.
Austin is a good salesman and did a great job from the beginning. He was decent and responsive on emails and calls.

The check engine light came on, a day after driving off the lot.
Austin took the car in and did a thorough check up / fix with their mechanic and since then I've driven around 1300 miles on it in a month with the car running in great condition.

Ask for Austin as your salesman on your visit to Pacific Honda.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1604911966298, 'text': 'Hi Esha, thank you for your kind review; we are happy to pass along your comments to Austin here at Pacific Honda!

Be sure to ask for Jimmy Gardemann. He’s INCREDIBLE!! Hands down, the best car shopping experience to date! He’s sweet, funny, knowledgeable and didn’t pressure us at all. He really went above and beyond for our daughter and getting her her first brand new dream car!

I wish I could say the same for the finance guy (I can’t remember his name). I always dread this part of the car shopping experience and for good reason. He was demeaning and gave us the third degree everytime we declined the extra add-on coverage packages. I realize they’re just doing their job and this is how they make money but still, I don’t think it’s okay to question the customer’s decision, let alone, make them feel stupid for not purchasing said extras. I shouldn’t have to explain the WHY behind the NO.

But, we love Jimmy! Thank you, Jimmy!< /text>

Another round of vehicles for our family from Pacific Honda. There isn’t a dealership in town that I would recommend over them. Purchasing a new car should be an exciting time and this team makes sure you drive away feeling that way. Ryan Kinkel and Mark Morrow are top notch, folks. Make sure the next time you’re thinking about a new vehicle that Pacific Honda is your first call.

Great experience overall. Drop off and pickup was smooth and I was kept updated on the status of my vehicle. I would have given 5 stars but there was no shuttle operating due to COVID and no complimentary rideshare like some of the other dealerships offer. I ended up having to walk for over and hour to get home. Not a big deal for me but could be a challenge for some.< /text>

Friendly guys at the service desk, but labor is a whopping $155 an hour. I don't  think surgeons even get that much! I paid $370 for 2.5 hours of labor and $125 in parts for a 60k mile service. I was told i needed to replace all 4 tires because the wear was uneven. I went to another shop and they showed me that the wear was even on the back tires with about 50% life remaining, and the front tires may need replacing due to cracks in the rubber... Unless you have no other option, save your money and go somewhere else. Only reason it's not a 1-star is because the staff is very friendly and their estimate was accurate. Just too expensive.<//Text>

< Review>
This is one of the worst customer service interactions I have ever encountered. On Friday my sunroof exploded while driving. There was nothing around that could have caused this.. no cars, no overpass above me, nothing. Upon further investigation, I found there is an NHTSA investigation into this specific defect with Honda vehicles. I called Honda America and told them exactly what happened; I mentioned the other investigations into exploding sunroofs from Honda (as well as other vehicle types) and the representative told me yes, that I should schedule an appointment to have a diagnostic test completed in order for it to be considered a defect and covered by Honda. I called right away to schedule an appointment for Saturday morning and I explained that Honda America acknowledged this defect and the dealership will treat this as such. After confirming the appointment, I then received a call back saying that because it was a defect I would have to reschedule my appointment for Monday at 7am to have a manager present. I said no problem, I didn't drive anywhere over the weekend in fear of glass getting pushed around, and I showed up Monday morning at 7am. Right as I arrived, a gentleman came up to my car and so rudely interrupted and talked over me the entire time I tried explaining what happened and what Honda America said. He was unbelievably disrespectful and not only wrote me off completely, but he acted as thought I knew absolutely nothing about anything! It was ridiculous. All I was told by him, before he even looked into my sunroof, that this was not a defect, a pebble hit my car, and they will not be doing a diagnostic test as was scheduled. All he had done was take a couple pictures then walked away. I then asked to speak to a manager only to be told managers don't arrive until 9am. WHY would they tell me to come in early for a manager to be present since Honda America agreed it was a defect even though there wouldn't be any managers there until two hours later? The service rep had a terrible attitude, treated me with no regard, and talked down to me which I can only be lead to believe it was because I am a woman. I saw him interact and speak with male customers in a completely different manner than he did with me. I could not believe it. Would he have respected me more if I told him I was in the military? Just typing this out and thinking about how he treated me absolutely baffles me. He didn't even want to listen to me. I asked him to show me where the pebble would be if it had fallen through. He couldn't answer because he didn't find one. I had done my research, I wasn't asking Honda to replace my car. I was asking Honda to honor their customer service and warranty pledge and fix a defect in a car they produce. (A defect that is currently being investigated by NHTSA with countless prior incidents. I even had the documents to show all of this.) This is a known defect, backed by the NHTSA investigations. Finally, and this is the kicker, I waited two and a half hours for a manager to arrive and he quoted me almost $1000 but would "give me a discount" so I wouldn't have to use my insurance since they weren't looking into it for being a defect. Even after this discount, there was absolutely no way I was going to get my sunroof fixed at this shop. As much as I wanted Honda to honor their defect policy, I needed to get it fixed as I feared it would become dangerous for myself as well as other drivers. When I took my car to another repair shop because Pacific Honda made me feel so uncomfortable and disrespected, I was asked why I did not just go to Honda because this is a known defect, and that this shop has seen this before! I could not believe it. The repair shop said it must be because my car is a 2020 and it could be too new. I bought a brand new Honda Civic because of its reputation of quality and customer service. I plan on filing a complaint with Honda America because of this experience.<//Review>

Came in to purchase a Honda Civic and Esteban Santiago Aka Steven helped us to purchase this vehicle. However when it came down to buying the car he added a random amount as a down payment  which was never mentioned face to face, we were disappointed on how bad the customer service was.< /Review>

I would just like to say that I loved my experience with Pacific Honda. The staff was extremely nice and the wait time for a car was a short process. I didn’t think there were any games or gimmicks when negotiating a deal. The Honda team was honest with me about what I qualified for and made a great effort to make the best deal for me. Also, I must make a shout out to a Honda member named Jojie. He went above and beyond when helping me with the car buying process. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family!</text>

Great experience. Ahmad our salesperson was fantastic. He literally ran from place to place to get our paperwork taken care of. He gets a 10 out of 10 score from us. We hit a couple of speed bumps along the way and at one point there three people working at solving the problems. Pacific Honda will be our go to place for any future auto purchase. We would also like to thank Andrea who was very helpful in the completion of our purchase. We have made several new car purchases over the years and this was by far the best experience yet. Thank you all.<//Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>We ended up purchasing a really nice CR-V hybrid. The sales team and sales manager were great. They located a car in the color I wanted equipped the way I wanted at a fair price. It was very busy and we had to wait 90 minutes to sign the deal. The next day we received a text 7 minutes before we were supposed to pick up the cat saying it’s not ready. A call would have been nice. However we did get a nice free floor mat.

My only gripe is the heavy pressure to sell a service contract at the time of signing. Really a lot of subtle innuendo on repair costs, being a new hybrid model, the potential for problems. I’ve purchased a few cars and it’s always the same. No wonder people buy cars on line.</review>< pics>

Took my car in this morning because there was a nail lodged in my tire. Brandon, the service rep. and the young lady working the front of the shop were pleasant. Thankfully, the tire was able to be patched for ~$22.00 and I got a 10% discount, which was nice...It was await of ~2 hours. The only complaint I have is that the waiting area was cold (AC on) when the weather outside was also quite chilly.</Text>

<text>I really appreciate the entire Pacific Honda Used Car Department who helped me getting my CRV, especially Kalen and his manager Steve.  I have to say that I am not an easy customer, but Kalen is extremely courtesy and patient who even skipped his lunch which mostly due to me being indecisive and partly due to they have sold out a lot their used cars over the Labor Day weekend,  to help me complete my transaction. Even thought Kalen has only been with Honda for a few months, he has shown his extensive knowledge of Honda vehicles.  Steve is a deal maker and together they make a great team!  In addition, I found that Pacific Honda has the best price among all San Diego Honda dealers after spending extended time researching used CRVs for the last few weeks. I would definitely recommend Pacific to others who are looking for vehicles, new or used.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>5-star rating based on communication, speed of replies, and quality answers to my questions.  After messaging many other dealers, Pacific Honda's team is much better.  I can't wait to test drive that Honda CR-V hybrid!

Edit: I had contacted four other dealerships in the county, but none of them were able to help me as well as Pacific Honda.  Dario and Andrea helped me  find the car and price the accessories with  help from the parts team.  Dario found the car and kept it until I returned to the states.  Andrea worked with me refining what I wanted and helping me determine the right price.  They truly are a pleasure to work with.  I set up an appointment and felt very welcome.   The CR-V test drive went well and I went into financing and met with Tonya.  She was both professional and warm and made the purchase easy to understand and to complete.  I hesitate to say that going in and signing a loan document is fun, but with Tonya it really was.

Just finished a six hour drive in the CR-V through the mountains and a snowstorm.  There are many cool features of the system and the vehicle.  The best one is the lane keeper assist.  With the real time AWD and the lane assist, I felt safe and comfortable the entire drive.

Thanks again to Dario, Andrea, and Tonya!  I look forward to working with you again.

My review as of 9/02/20.  Two days after I put my review, I got contacted by Jeff young from Pacific Honda and asked me what happened.  I explained to him what happened to my car.  He said "bring it back and will make it right. With feedback, we improve."  I took my car today and they tested again. They confirmed that the problem is "right wheel bearing."  They gave me a $154.88 credit (I paid for diagnosis) toward replacing a wheel bearing. I my got car fixed. My car is running smooth.  I do believe Pacific Honda is a great place to bring your car for service and pair. I just want to thank Jeff young and Jerremie Minter for their outstanding service.< /Text>

I just purchased my first Honda vehicle from Ryan and Greg at Pacific Honda in San Diego. They listened to what I was looking for and helped me choose the right vehicle for me, a Civic Hatchback EX. I would (and already have) recommend them to people I know. I would definitely go back for my next car!< /text>

I walked into Pacific Honda with a pretty good idea of the vehicle I wanted. However, i still test drove three vehicles and made the final decision on the vehicle I wanted to purchase. Ryan Soliman helped me and the process went with ease. there was no pressure and everyone at the dealership was very helpful.  Thank you Pacific Honda for not making this a stressful experience. Most car dealerships i have been to in the past were not up to my standards.<//Review>

I purchased my HR-V here and had a very positive experience with the original buying process. Follow-up service has been less positive. My most recent service (needed due to manufacturer recall) was rescheduled twice, and then I was charged for the gas used in my "free" rental (which I only used to go back and forth from my home to Honda; and I only had to go to the service center due to recall).</review>

He was patient and made sure to provide us with all the information we needed to make an informed decision. He even personally followed up for weeks after our purchase to see if we had any questions and make sure we were enjoying the new car.

I found this dealership to be highly focused on upselling "extras" throughout the buying and financing process.  I felt that much of the buying process could/should have been done online, but instead required me to sit in the store for an extended period of time.  The dealership then incorrected informed me that I did not have sufficient auto insurance coverage to take the vehicle home.  When I finally got a hold of my insurance company, I learned that I did in fact have ALL of the insurance requested by the dealership.  Although I left with a new vehicle, I left disappointed in the drawn out sales/financing process that was riddled with attempts to upsell me on products and services that I do not want or need.  After an unnecessarily long buying/financing process, I left the dealership without being given a tour of my new vehicle.  It was by far the worst car buying experience of my lifetime.  There are plenty of Honda dealers in San Diego County.  I would recommend choosing a different one.  Perhaps a dealership with a focus on customer service and efficiency.  I would NOT recommend this dealership to my friends or family.  Although I love Hondas, I will sadly need to find a new dealership.  Again, I am extremely disappointed in this dealership.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Ryan was fantastic and really tried to understand my needs. We looked at both new and used cars, compared leases vs financing or cash, and he took me on a test drive route that safely let me open it up and test all the features. Ask for Ryan Soliman if you want someone to get you what you're actually looking for.
I settled on  a used Civic with only the options I really wanted. Their online listings are priced to sell and they didn't make me buy anything extra or add on any hidden fees! (TTL and Doc are all standard)
When working with financing, I'd really appreciate having my options presented to me to review. Instead of certifications, they reduce their prices and offer 3 levels of warranty. Even though Pacific Honda has a good record, I went for the 2 year, mid-tier warranty (covers power-train and anything else mechanical), so I have no fears about buying a used car. The optional "Karr" system is a one-time fee which lets you find your car and has an awesome remote lock/unlock, but I skipped that this time. Make sure you ask for that info as soon as you sit down with financing!
Thanks, Ryan & the Pacific Honda team. My new Civic has exactly what I wanted, the mileage is fantastic, and is clean as hell.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>My 2016 Honda CRV was towed to Pacific Honda as the metal connector that mounts on Battery post had corroded and broken off. Their Service Advisor recommended replacing the entire cable which I agreed to. Later on, I was informed that it would take 4 hours of Labor to replace it which I disputed several times. I was overcharged by at least 2 hours of Labor as no satisfactory answer was provided. Avoid going to this dealership!</review>< Pics>

Leased our very first car today (Honda Civic) with the help of sales agent Ryan. He was wonderfully friendly and sweet. The finance guy (Anthony) was also very sweet and knowledgeable. All and all, felt the agents were honest and trustworthy. Would recommend if you are interested in Honda vehicles.</Text>

Ryan called me to discuss my end of lease options. What a great experience! Ryan was welcoming and professional. He knows this business from the financial point of view and was able to give several options to choose from. I walked away with a new car and very pleased with the price and the service. Highly recommend working with Ryan.< /Text>

DJ was fast and efficient, he worked hard to get me in a car and he found the perfect car for me with all of my requirements. I was very impressed in his confidence in his ability to get me the loan and a way for me to also get the warranty protection I needed on the car since it was used and had no factory warranty.  I am covered thanks to DJ. I know if I have questions or need something car related , I am sure DJ will get me the answers or help.  Thanks Pacific Honda for getting me on the road.< /Review>

< review>
We've been taking our Hondas to Pacific Honda for service for more than 25 years and this is the first time we've been even slightly disappointed. After picking up our 2010 Accord after routine maintenance I noticed that one of the mechanics made a notation that the tires were not rotated because the rear tires had "feathering", which is caused by misalignment. Instead of calling us to let us know about the issue and taking care of it (they have their own alignment equipment) they just let us drive away. Now I have to take the car to an alignment shop.</review>

After shopping around at 2 other Honda dealerships in San Diego county this place had the best price. I am so glad I made my purchase here. The salesman Dario was great, patient, friendly (but not overly fake friendly), knowledgeable and helpful! He gave us the price we left the dealership to go have lunch and take time to think about the purchase and then helped us graciously when I returned. The Allstate Insurance agent that came to talk to me was not particularly friendly or helpful but he also didn't try to sell me anything.  Finally the financial lady Tonya was very helpful and straightforward.  This dealership also had the biggest selection of Honda Clarity vehicles in stock which was nice when having to select a color. Overall a really nice experience! I recommend this place over DCH Mission Valley Honda and Norm Reeves Honda in Vista.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909<//GmapID><user>104047776525019660482<//user>< date>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I have been car shopping for a very long time for an EV or PHEV and Honda really wasn't on my list of vehicles.  I went to 3 local Honda dealerships, Pacific Honda being the 3rd, and had a really positive experience.

Mark & Andrea, the sales managers are professional, warm, and lead a very good team of professionals.  The found me the car I wanted, worked with me to get a price that was appropriate, and as we went through the process, were very accommodating.

I want to give a special acknowledgement to Marcelo is sales.  One of the warmest and caring people I encountered, walked me through the nuances of my new vehicle, gave me a 30 minute tutorial, and really made sure that not only I understood the car and all of the technology that comes with it, but got me a lot of follow up information in a very timely manner.  Thank you Marcelo!

And to Samantha in financing - again, a positive experience.  She wants to ensure that the customer understands, and is thorough in her explanation of everything.  Samantha, Andrea, and her team went above and beyond to assist me with a rebate as well.

Thank you Pacific Honda.  I appreciate your customer service and your warm approach.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I inquired about a new Honda Touring Hybrid on Friday night and completed the purchase by Saturday at 2pm. They gave me a fair trade-in for what was my current vehicle and gave me an awesome deal on the price of the new car and a great interest rate. Jeff Hayes was the gentleman who helped me and it went smooth as silk. He was very knowledgeable and able to answer all of my questions. Everyone at the dealership were just plain old awesome.< /review>< user_name>

Pacific Honda's service department is absolutely fantastic.  I have a 2016 CR-V and they quickly identified a wheel bearing starting to fail and a transmission issue.  They immediately replaced both under warranty, no questions asked.  This is how to generate customer loyalty.  I am a big fan!  Thank you Pacific Honda!</Text>

I initially leased a brand new civic with the dealership and then recently went in to upgrade to a larger vehicle in preparation for my first baby. We had a budget and a specific price in mind and really wanted to make the Passport work for us. Fred was absolutely amazing. Fred gave us honest feedback, answered all of our questions, Honda loyalty discounts and battled pricing for us to ultimately get exactly what we wanted and at the price we needed. He was just great and so easy to work with. We also want to thank Samantha in Finance for helping us find additional qualifying discounts that allowed us to leave with paint and upholstery protection and coverage. My husband and I are so happy with our purchase and very proud to be loyal Honda buyers! Thank you Pacific Honda team!</Review>< rate>

It was a great experience. I was helped by Shawn Abraham. If you come in with research knowing what you want and how much you want it for, it can be really easy to get a great deal with no hassling. They were super nice and patient in helping me. Would definitely recommend coming here for a great deal.< /Review>

Best service experience ever. Every one is so friendly, and really show that they care to make sure your car is ready to drive off. We need more places like this! Awesome service guys!< /Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Just purchased a car from Pacific Honda.  I worked with Andy Vargas--an excellent salesman!  Andy is friendly, professional, patiently answered all my questions about the car, and he served as my champion in getting the best price possible.  I thoroughly did my research and felt very comfortable working with Andy and the agreed upon price.  He also worked hard to streamline the car buying process, which I greatly appreciated.  I highly recommend working with Andy--you won't be disappointed.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>The entire experience was positive with no pressure. The sales rep Kai was friendly, honest and extremely helpful. The finance rep was also straightforward and helpful. Never felt uncomfortable or pushed into making a decision. They were also very knowledgeable. I highly recommend working with Kai if you are thinking about getting a new Honda.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I went there skeptical if I could even get out of my 2020 Nissan Sentra. I always wanted a Honda Civic Si and for the most part when it comes to preowned they fly off the lot. I gave Pacific Honda a shot and there was no pressure selling, there was no how about this car instead. They were honest and great to deal with and have had an amazing experience at this dealership. I will be coming back to purchase a second vehicle in the near future.</review>

<Review>I went into Pacific Honda on Monday, not having dealt with a car dealership in 8 years, and not knowing what to expect.  I was helped by Dario Morla, who from start to finish, was exceptional. He was patient and explained the process of leasing a car, which was new to me.  He was genuine and actually got to know me as a person, not just as a customer.  He really worked with me on my trade in and financial situation, and was able to give me a lease option that I was able to do on my budget.  All the other staff that I came into contact that day were extremely friendly and helpful as well.  I would highly recommend Honda Pacific, and Dario in particular, to anyone with leasing or buying needs in San Diego!<//Review>< Resp>

Shopping at the Pacific Honda dealership was a breeze! All the employees gave amazing customer service. We want to especially thank Fred for being with us the entire time and taking care of everything we were concerned about. Fred provided excellent service by connecting with us while being patient through our millions of questions. He even got us set up with insurance through All-State, which we weren’t planning to go through them at first but after Fred talked about the options and excellent service All-State provides we were happy to sign up with them. We were first time buyers and we were so thankful Fred was with us every step of the way!<//Review>

Buying a new vehicle can be fun, but also very tedious and boring sometimes. When we saw they had the Volkswagen Alltrack color combination we like we call them.

If you want a straight forward great and I mean great deal on a Honda car then go to Pacific Honda and ask for Jeff Hayes.  He was responsive, honest, quick and answered a lot of questions before I brought my elderly mother in to lease a new 2020 Civic Sport Hatchback.  In 2.5 hours we were out of there with a brand new car with a full tank of gas and it was spotless.  Richard in finance made it pleasant and quick (15 minutes part of the total 2.5 hours).  I hope you have as great an experience.<//Review>

Thanks again Jeff for making me a happy Honda owner!</Text>

<review>Hi there,

Purchased my 99 Honda Accord EX from "Bo" as a new vehicle that year and have always had it serviced at your facility.
I keep a notebook three ring binder in my trunk will the sales window sticker and all the service records.
The service department has always been good to me.
I love the waiting room, and usually wait for my service to be completed.
The coffee is excellent.
If you had a couple of massage chairs in the waiting room that would even be better.< /review>< pictures>

Pacific Honda has always provided me with excellent customer service for the past 3 years. I had my first and now second lease through them and feel like I am being taken care of. They are transparent about their leasing and financing options and are willing to work with you. I can't wait to purchase my dream SI when the time is right. Pacific Honda will treat you with respect and kindness.< /text>

Made an appointment to get new tires and have regular maintenance done on my Honda Fit. Started off alright, the staff is super friendly and helpful. Then they told me it would be 3-4 hours because it was really busy! Why did I even make an appointment?? 2 hours later I got a call that they were almost done but didn’t have any tires!? The reason I made the appointment in the first place. Anyway, waited another 2 hours, still no tires and I had to call them to see if they were done. Not impressed</review>

<rate>1</rate><review>When I purchased my used 2016 from Pacific Honda it only came with 1 key/remote transmitter.  I decided that it was unwise to have only one so I decided to purchase a duplicate.  When I called I was told it would be about $150.  I thought this was veryexpensive.  When I actually came to purchase it, I found it was $308.  That price is absurd.  I feel I should have gotten a huge discount since the car didn't come with a second key as it should have.  For Honda to charge over $300 for a key is highway robbery.  Not at all happy and probably won't consider Pacific Honda in the future.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Jason is amazing!!! Best customer service I have ever received anywhere. Everyone there was great! I am from Spring Valley and was driving a friend when I got a flat. Even though I live in Spring Valley, California I will always drive down to Pacific Honda for my needs because of Jason and the team. GREAT JOB HONDA!!</review>

< Review>
I took my car Honda Civic 2010 EX for an transmission oil change. Luckily, I met Jun Iwsaki service advisor.

After the transmission oil change completed, Jun brought the bill to cashier and said the coupon 13% off was applied for my bill.

My hint: Always ask for oil change coupons! You might be surprised at a few of them!</Review>

<review>friendly staff and mechanics. Waiting for repairs is actually relaxing. The waiting area is comfortable. They offer coffee and nice outside tables or inside to watch TV.  Lots of nearby places to walk to while waiting. For repairs or oil change.
Attendants are helpful in explaining mechanic issues.
Open on Saturdays for early bird oil change.  Central location.<//review><Time>1589083994808< /Time><Rating>4<//Rating><UserId.>117899630369991713385< /UserId.><GmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Thank you to everyone at Pacific Honda Express Service for taking care of my car on a busy holiday weekend. I appreciate the great work and the other little things they do like checking my break pads, fluids, etc. The coupons and customer discounts made this visit affordable and now I have one less thing to worry about.

Book an apt over the phone the lady on the phone was really nice. I went in for a recall on n my 2010 honda I rented a rental car woah that rental was luxurious. Angela was the one that helped me out with my rental great person and good customer service. Jun was my service person great customer service as well Told me that it would be ready by 5pm evening. Even better they called me around 1:30 to tell me my carrito was ready I broom broom to pick up my car. Car was ready no wait at all. Pretty awesome recommend this place.< /Review>

< review>
Normally, and since I work, I bring my car in for service, briefly complete paperwork, jump in a van to go to the other Pacific Honda property, briefly complete loaner car paperwork, get loaner car keys, and go! However, this time, the van, surprisingly, took a few of us to the Enterprise Rental location (not far away), where about 20 people were outside standing or vying for a shady spot to sit/stand. I had to wait outside in the heat for about an hour, and there were some people who had waited even longer who were very upset and complaining loudly. Due to the long (and very uncomfortable) wait, I had to cancel appointments and re-arrange my day. We've been loyal customers of Pacific Honda for years, and although we're grateful for the loaner car, as well as past good service, I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with what occurred a few days ago. Please let me know this situation will be remedied in the future. Best regards, Goldie Sinegal and Herman Dustman< /review>

<text>Pro:
Ahmed (salesman) was great to deal with and finance team made the process Quick and easy after I told them I'm not interested in any add ons.

Cons:
- Dealership offered no water bottle.. you have to purchase it yourself..
- Detailing team is terrible, they literally ran my newly purchased car through the drive thru car wash and said here you go.. I had Ahmed bring it back to the cleaning team 2 times after I refused to accept a brand new car with bird poop on it.
- Still wasn't satisfied after the 3rd go around but I had to leave due to having to catch a flight Within 3 hours.
- My floor mats are not secured to the locks. Again, delivery detail prep guys don't care.<//text><Time>1607387234870< /Time></record>

I purchased my Honda at Pacific Honda. I took it in for an oil change which was done in one hour. They also showed me that I needed a new cabin filter. Many other areas of my car were checked and reported to me. The representative was very polite and friendly. This service department has always treated me well. I highly recommend them.</Text>

<Review>The service team was very welcoming and was able to explain to me in detail the process for repairing my vehicle. There was a no pressure feel to the experience that makes it easy to walk away if you need to. If you decide to get your repairs done here, the service staff are very upfront about the repairs that need to be performed, as well as the cost in both time and money. I would recommend going here if you need any work done, or even just a professional diagnosis for your stubborn diy projects.< /Review>< userid>

<Text>We had a great experience purchasing our new vehicle from Pacific Honda. We made an appointment to test drive a 2020 Honda CRV Hybrid and Tarig helped us. He showed us the features and answered our questions about the vehicle. We weren't ready to commit yet because we wanted to test drive a few other SUVs. About 2-3 weeks later, we went back to Pacific Honda and Tarig again guided us through options and answered all of our questions. The staff was nice to us and we felt safe amidst the COVID precautions. We came back to Pacific Honda because we thought they provided great service. We left with our new vehicle and are very much enjoying it!< /Text>< pics>

I appreciated Robert (sales) and the whole Pacific Honda team in assisting me with the purchase of my new Honda Passport. I have purchased many cars and this experience by far exceeds all of the other dealings I have previously had. The team worked quickly and efficiently and I was given a great deal. I know that I will definitely come to Pacific Honda for any other further car needs.</Review>

Superb service.  Everyone was courteous on the phone and in person.  During the month of June, Honda offered pick up and return of my car for servicing  in my area.  Everyone wore a mask.  Car came back in excellent condition - it now drives like a new car! (and it is a 2009)</Review>

<review>Made an appointment for annual service. I'm a low mileage driver since COVID and if it hadn't been year one for me, the service manager said I wouldn't need an oil change. But, they checked everything - tires for wear, filters (we've had lots of fires lately), etc. and did change the oil. I was able to wait outside at some tables next to the express service building. I was glad that option was available since I don't want to be indoors too much now with people I don't know. Everyone was courteous. One negative: I will say that I had a question the day before and I tried to call, but no one answered the service phone. I tried the chat feature online, but the chat person seemed uninformed and referred me to the service phone. <Sigh.>< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1600966125376, 'text': "Roberta, we appreciate you taking the time to leave us this feedback.

We talked to the sales rep prior to going in and identified model and price we wanted to pay. They met our terms, no hard sell for unneeded items. Paperwork was efficient and ready to go. Pacific Honda has a fantastic team, I highly recommend going there for your or a family member's next car.</Text><username>Stephen Burfield< /username>< Rate>

The price had just been dropped a few thousand dollars over the weekend and was already extremely low, so there was no room for any additional negotiation (which was not surprising).

I have leased two cars here at Pacific Honda, my second one about one week ago. Each time I have felt taken care of and leave comfortable, both in the car itself and financially. I was in and out in about 3.5 hours this last time, which I very much appreciated from Dario! Finding a new car is intimidating, although it’s been a nice experience here. I will plan on sticking with Pacific Honda for every auto related purchase in the future.</Review>

I came to Pacific Honda after a bad experience at Mission Valley's Honda. Our Salesperson at Pacific, Kai was the absolute best. He was very patient, gave great customer service and left me feeling that I as the customer was more important than my money. I was overwhelmed but only because this was me buying our first car. Mr. Ryan was also very helpful and so was Mr. Nico. Overall, this entire team of people are really amazing. I'm so glad I came here to purchase our vehicle and I'm one step closer to my dream car! Thank you everyone at Pacific Honda! :)< /review>

I had an absolute perfect experience at Pacific Honda.  I went a Saturday morning and was quickly greeted by Jimmy.  He asked some quick key questions about my needs, and immediately starting showing me options in my range.  He was professional, understood my situation, very experienced, and made the entire situation extremely easy.  I could not be happier with the entire transaction and I have definitely told several people about your location and how wonderful Jimmy is to work with!  I cannot say enough that Jimmy easily exceeded expectations.  I know 100% that i will go back to Pacific Honda when the time comes, especially if Jimmy is still there.  He is a true professional and a stand up guy.

I also went to the Mission Valley Honda the day prior and was treated like I was wasting their time.  They had some young man, Anthony, helping me and basically told me my money was no good there.  I was absolutely dumbfounded the difference in service from Mission Valley Honda and Pacific Honda.  Night and Day.  I highly recommend Pacific Honda and I wish Jimmy and the team a very successful rest of the year and a bright 2020!!  Mission Valley Honda can go kick rocks.< /Text>

<Review>Had a great experience purchasing my car during Covid-19. Mark Morrow and I spoke on the phone and were able to talk about the specific car I wanted, the price and financing before when stepping foot at the the dealership.
Stephen Tessler helped us once we arrived and set us up on a borrowed car test drive, so it was just me and my husband. Then helped us with all the paperwork.
And finally Tonya Wilmore finished the finance with the amount that I had originally been quoted.
Overall it was a wonderful experience and I'm loving my new Honda Fit ❤️</Review>< Pictures>

Over the last few years I have had my share of bs car dealerships and shady sales people. So much that when I first contacted Pacific Honda I was already on the defensive side. I emailed an inquiry regarding a Honda accord. A sales person by the name of Joji replied to my inquiry on May 4th. He asked if he could call me. I said no, that I want to communicate through email only. ( I do this so I can reference back just in case . ) Joji respected my wishes and by May 6th we had over 30 emails going back and forth. Never once did he talk about prices ,credit scores, or push for me to come in.
One day I emailed him and his boss called me and told me Joji was off that day and he would get back to me. He didn't try to get involved or push a sale, simply a courtesy call. Later that day Joji actually replied back to my email and answered more of my questions. ON HIS DAY OFF! I thought that was pretty cool. We continued to talk and he respectfully answered all my questions,never once pushing for a sale. He told me at the beginning, when your ready then we will talk  and he kept his word. Then on May 8th I emailed him and asked if I could come and look at some cars. He said yes and I came in on May 9th.  Prior to coming in, I told Joji, do not hand me off to someone else when I get there and I'm only looking and can not buy right now. He said no problem.
May 9th I come in and he shows me three different cars lets me test drive one. The whole time nothing was mentioned about buying a car. When I was done test driving  the car. I told him I liked it and yes I ended up getting it. Lol but Joji and pacific Honda let me make that choice. They handled all my objections to buying a car earlier that I wanted. Meaning : worked with me on my down payment and delayed my first car payment, so I would have time to return my lemon car Im currently in.  The best part! They gave me the car payment I wanted, well 3 cents over but come on! 3 cents. Lol
Bottom line Joji was an excellent person to work with. Seriously.. I felt relaxed and most important safe when doing business with him.
Thank you Joji. Thank you Pacific Honda. Way to leave a good 1st impression!
PS We all know dealerships are your best friends until you sign the paperwork and drive off with your new car, then they pretty much wash there hand of you. Honestly though My gut didn't feel that way with Joji or the dealership itself. I hope my gut it right. If not I will definitely update! :)< /text>

<text>My first real car buying experience was absolutely smooth and was treated very kindly and super friendly staff. My sales guys name was Eduardo and he really made me feel at home and took it upon myself to really fight for the best deal and it showed. I’m very happy that I decided to come here to buy my new car. I have a good feeling that I’ll be coming back in the future for my 2nd vehicle. Eduardo knocked every stereo type about what you duh just a car sales man should do or act, he was t pushy and was very professional. The paperwork was a breeze and like I said, smooth. Thank you Pacific Honda and Eduardo for helping me out when I needed it the most. Means the world to me.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< Review>
I came in to buy a car a few months ago, from Shawn(I think that’s his name) maybe Shane.
Shawn was great! When he asked me what was holding me back I told him I was really worried about the insurance pricing on a new car.

Shawn told me he had someone who could help. She came over and was able to beat what I was currently paying by a lot and add in the new car.

This past weekend I went with my friend so she could buy her car as well. My friend was also worried about her insurance but the same woman that helped me was able to help my friend!

I got some of her cards and will be passing them out on base to my friends. I would highly recommend Pacific Honda. It’s a one stop shop with great customer service all the way around.</Review>

Firas Ballo was delightful , multitasking multiple deals at once cuz of how great their sales are right know!!! I don’t know what’s going on if it’s cuz of COVID-19 or what but while car’s prices went up everywhere else..., at PACIFIC HONDA I got a 2017 Honda Civic lx with only 19000 miles on it still brand new, out the door $16500 clean. And to top it all off Sonya, who handled all the paper work at the end, practically threw in an upgraded alarm system that does all kind of stuff😉 she’s too kind. All in under an hour and a half I drove of in my brand new car! Smiling for the first time in a long time now. Thanks to Firas and his trusted and very helpful team there at Pacific Honda home to your family dealership .

They do good service.  The process can be a little confusing.  In my case I took my car to the main Service Center to have standard 5,000 mile maintenance.      When I came back to pick the car up I found that I needed to instead pay and pick up the car at the Express Service Counter.< /Review>

I went in for an oil change and was charged 30-40 dollar over the normal amount. They have no explanation as to why it is so high. When asked they stated that’s just the way it is. I asked multiple times how much was it before the services my car and didn’t receive an answer until after the completed it. Also the parking lot is entirely too small for the type of service they provide, if you run a business solely for cars people should be able to maneuver through the parking lot IN THEIR CAR without and issue, instead of employees constantly asking them to move when there is no place to move to. Horrible experience would not recommend this facility.  I only gave them two stars bc my work was done in a timely manner other than that the entire experience was terrible.</text>

Jimmy, and the entire Pacific Honda team were awesome! They had me in and out to negotiate and buy a new car in less than 3 hours, and they were somewhat busy. There were at least 4 other customers in the dealership. The dedication, and kindness Jimmy showed to me and my young daughter throughout the initial discussion, during the negotiations and after completion of the purchase was amazing. He’s a great guy and I’d recommend anyone interested in buying a car go talk him!

UPDATE - My Odyssey is a real clunker and in 4 months it’s been very n for warranty or recall fixes a few times. Now after getting the DVD player, cracking sound speakers and molding fixed I’ll be taking it back only 1 week later because the window no longer operates. The Service Department is okay, but it’s a hassle constantly taking it in. I thought Honda’s were reliable. 😕< /review>

Got a new Civic hatchback and the car is awesome.  Smooth sales process. Definitely recommend Pacific Honda!
Update: Have had the car one week now and I have to tell you, this car drives sooooo nice!!! The turbocharged 1.5 liter motor is so responsive and the car handles like a race car! For a car that has a sticker price just under 30K, this car is worth every penny! Sport Touring package which is fully loaded, great sound system, nav, moonroof, leather, LOVE this car!!!!<//Text>

I bought a Honda this weekend at Pacific Honda.  I really appreciated the team at this store and was never pressured or harassed to make any decisions.  I test drove multiple cars over different weekends and everyone was very kind.  Thank you Ferris, Lapaka and Dustin.< /text>

I had a good experience looking at the cars and test driving. Once I got in the salesman’s office, his personality did a 180 degree turn and started to get aggressive. He even rushed my on certain paperwork and started to give an attitude when I asked about the 3-day right to cancel document. I said no to a lot of the dealers proposed deals, but that still shouldn’t be a reason to be rude to the customer. I got the car I wanted at a decent deal, so I’m over it.<//Review>

It was a great experience buying at Pacific Honda. Marcelo Cruz, our salesman, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about our Honda. He was very accommodating and helpful. Also he worked hard to make the deal and searched for incentives to help us reduce our cost. Also, financing was a pleasant experience at Specific Honda. I would recommend Pacific Honda to my friends.< /text>

Jimmy, and the entire Pacific Honda team were awesome! They had me in and out to negotiate and buy a new car in less than 3 hours, and they were somewhat busy. There were at least 4 other customers in the dealership. The dedication, and kindness Jimmy showed to me and my young daughter throughout the initial discussion, during the negotiations and after completion of the purchase was amazing. He’s a great guy and I’d recommend anyone interested in buying a car go talk him!

UPDATE - My Odyssey is a real clunker and in 4 months it’s been very n for warranty or recall fixes a few times. Now after getting the DVD player, cracking sound speakers and molding fixed I’ll be taking it back only 1 week later because the window no longer operates. The Service Department is okay, but it’s a hassle constantly taking it in. I thought Honda’s were reliable. 😕</text>

Great Friendly Customer Service. Honest People, carefully and clearly explained the issues with my car. The one big con I would state, are the high prices. But you already know that.

3/2/2021 Update: Same  as always, excellent customer service. My car is in and out in the same day every time quickly. Prices are steeper than I would like for a Honda civic, but I guess that's just how things work. I would definitely come  back again for any serious engine or transmission work but for the minor things I have been learning to do my own service. The parts shop here is very helpful here and so ill be back no matter what!</text>

I was looking for a smooth buying experience, no hassle, no worries, and especially no salesman tactics. Having been a Project Manager before, I have seen my fair share of sales tactics and lies and honestly, not a fan. I made that clear from the start and my sales person DJ was amazing. Straight forward. No pressure. He never tried pushing anything and respected my decisions. The day I decided to buy it was a quick and easy purchase. In and out with no issues. I am very pleased with Pacific Honda and plan on returning here for my future purchases. I will also be recommending this dealership. Thank you Pacific Honda and thank you DJ.<//Text>

They have changed procedures so all vehicles go into two lanes into the service bay, one for Express service (oil change) and one for service. No more free water. They spend a lot of time moving cars around, so Express service is not as fast. Used coupon so price was under $50.< /review>

I have never purchased a car with such an easy experience! I saw DJ with the fresh start program and honestly I was so anxious walking in there, but he reassured me that he could help. I was at the office for less than 2 hours! That is unheard of at a dealership. The last time I went to a dealership I was there for about 4 hours and had a horrific experience, but it was time for a new car and I needed help financing. Not only did I get a car that I LOVE - I never felt judged or pressured it was an open easy process. Pacific Honda has a lifetime customer! Shout out to DJ!<//text>

Service is akways good, but repairs are overpriced. No effort made to reward loyal clients with any kind of loyalty discount. Service rep has no problem piling on the costs without any sympathy. $1800 in a blink of an eye..< /Text>

<review>Just got a 2020 Honda Accord Sport last week with superb help from Robert and staff! I was pretty tired from talking to a different dealer earlier on in the day and was not satisfied with the service, but Pacific Honda exceeded my expectations.

The staff at Pacific Honda were very friendly and accommodating to my wants. It felt like they genuinely wanted to help me  find the car that I desired and though I went into the dealership at a pretty late time, Robert was super chill about test drives, looking at multiple models, and working out the finances. I also had a car lease from a different brand that expired and had no idea what I could do with it, but Robert explained it to me and got it off my hands. Overall, I just had a really good experience and would definitely recommend them if you're looking for a Honda and good service!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>5<//Rating><gmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909<//gmapID>< Time>

Loved the service I received! At 18 years old, you are expected to have limited credit history but I was commuting for work and school and the hassle was worth every dime spent for this car! Thanks to Eduardo Ibarra who helped me achieve everything I wanted for this car, from the amount down, to how much my monthly payments were, and how much my interest rate would be (considering I just turned 18 and I am a first time buyer). This car is a beauty and I could not be more grateful for how much help and time was put into this deal. Thank you pacific Honda!</Text>

<Text>We came in to check out the color of red on the Honda Clarity plug-in Hybrid and left with a DARK green Honda Clarity plug-in Hybrid.  We were not expecting to buy a car on that day but Will D., while not pressuring us, gave a great presentation of the advantages of the green Clarity.  Will walked us through the entire process including the vehicle familiarization.  Could not be more pleased with this young man and the manner in which he treated us.  The wife's last new car was a 65 Camero ( also green).  She loved that one and loves this one.  Tens (10) across the board for Will and the Pacific Honda team for the smooth and effortless process.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>During the pandemic no appointments were being taken.  I showed up very early before they opened on a Saturday morning at 7am and was first in line. They couldn't find the car key of previous customer that was blocking the line which caused more delays. The service rep, Erick, was courteous. The price for an oil change was high but the online coupon helped with a small discount.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909<//gmap_id><Date>1592930335643< /Date></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I arrived at Pacific Honda about 9:00 a.m., June 16th.  As soon as I pulled in a screener asked me what type of service I needed.  I told him just a scheduled maintenance according to the manual.  Immediately afterward, Joshua Herrera introduced himself, then conducted an outside inspection.  I met him inside the office and he checked the maintenance records of my Honda HR-V.  He told me it would be about 2-3 hours.  I signed the estimated cost/repairs and left to eat breakfast.  I returned to Pacific Honda about 11:15 a.m. and waited in the waiting room.  At 11:45, Josh called, informing me my car was ready.  I paid my invoice and drove off, knowing my car will be back in top notch condition.  This service was like eating at In-N-Out Burger, pull up, tell them what you need, your product is delivered, pay, and off you go, with a satisfied stomach, or should I say, knowing my car is safe to drive.  Sincerely, Dennis< /Review>

I had not expected to purchase a new car, but Shawn and he rest of the staff at Pacific Honda made it so easy. I was consistently treated with professional decorum, courtesy and fairness — from test drive to the moment I drive my new car off the lot.</Review>

I had spoken on the phone with Mark regarding the purchase of a CR-V. When I came in, they were all ready for me! Marquise set up the car the way I wanted and the process was expedited. I only spent a few hours there and then I had the keys to the car of my dreams in my hands! I would recommend this dealership to anyone who wants a great car with great and speedy service- five stars all the way!< /Review>

<review>be aware of this service center!! they play game to charge you!! Read the whole review please!! I am giving this review because their poor service and cheating the customers!! my CRV had a shaking problem and I brought my car there, I have an active bumper to bumper warranty and told them that I need to use my warranty to cover my repairing cost. first they said we diagnosed your car and if you repair it with us the diagnostic fee will be waved and I said OK, but after seating about 2 hours the service advisor told me I contacted your warranty company and they said we don't cover it and the cost for your engine shaking will be about $1800!! this cost wouldn't make sense for me to move forward and i left there at 5pm and paid the $150!! next day I contacted my warranty company they checked my request status and they told me we never said we don't cover, the Pacific Honda contacted us about 7PM (It was 2 hrs after I left there) and we only asked them to provide more information for us but they never called us back!!! It made me so mad that how the service advisor played a nasty game with me and I contacted with the Pacific Honda and explained it to the manager or supervisor and he said I will follow up with this issue and will call you back tomorrow but he never called me back!!!  I ended up to bring my car to my local mechanic guy he found out the problem was not from engine mounts and was from something else and replaced and fixed it for me for about $300 and my car is fixed now and they wanted to CHARGE ME $1800 for something that was not caused the problem!!!< /review>< UserId.>

< review>
The AC system For my 2016 honda civic Broke down. i went to other dealership services for this in the past to get repairs but it keeps failing. So i went to this and i had never had someone really explain to me what is wrong with the system until i met Ernie one of the technicians from pacific honda. He and josh made it easy for me and helped me figure out some details in regards to my extended warranty thus saving me a lot of money. Other dealership honda services before did not even bother to tell me i had extended warranty (i clearly forgot i had one) and they just ripped me off. But not here in pacific honda, josh took his time to do a research of my car’s services history. And Ernie diligently worked on my car.  I really appreciate the help they gave me. 🙏🏼</review>

<Review>Today I took my Honda Civic into Pacific Honda to get a new Battery. I called before I went down and they said that they were not  busy so just come in whenever I want. I talked to a service advisor : Joshua  Herrera about the battery and told him about the positive connection to the battery was loose and I could not get it to tighten any more. He looked at it and pointed out a crack in the connection. Also that the positive wire was part of a harness and that would cost $450.00. But another option would be that they could try to put a new connector on the wire and it would only cost $80.00. That seemed better than the $450.00 for a new harness, so I told him lets do that. While I was waiting I was looking at some of the Coupons that I had and found a Coupon  for a Complimentary  Brake inspection, Tires,and adjust the Parking brake. I asked him if it was to late to get this done and he said he would go over and tell the technician. Well all that got done to my satisfaction.<//Review>< name>

After a terrible experience at a Honda dealership close to home, I decided to drive further and check out Pacific Honda. We spoke with Jimmy Gardemann, our salesman and Andrea Schramm. We immediately felt comfortable and they were both Informative and friendly.  Jimmy and Andrea answered all questions of ours patiently. They were willing to work with us and make sure we got everything we wanted in our purchase. I must say that this was my best car shopping experience ever.
Nowadays, it is commonly seen that car salesmen just don’t do enough good job and their only objective is to get money out of your wallet. But, salesmen like Jimmy Gardemann delivers an incredible service and gives a very pleasant experience. I highly recommend Pacific Honda and their team to give you an honest and comfortable buying experience.</review>

Thank you, Max Al Taie, for helping my sister and I on purchasing our first new cars! We know we were a handful with our indecisiveness and million questions but Max is truly a professional and is great at what he does. Thank you for your honest opinions, patience and not rushing us into a decision. A decision that literally took half a day running in the brazing sun for. It's been four days and I'm in love with my car more than ever. Thank you Pacific Honda and Max Al Taie! You guys are great! I will send my family, friends and co-workers your way!</Text>

Had such a great experience at Pacific Honda in Kearny Mesa! Ask for Brooks Simpson! Such a great guy who CARES about what is the right fit for you. He made sure to know my budget beforehand and work with me accordingly and helped me pick out a car I will use for many years! I could not be happier with my purchase. Thank you Brooks!< /Review>

Hondas are the way to go right now. Received alot of emails to trade up and pay off my car to drive something newer. My only issue was finding the car I wanted because I loved mine. But Pac Honda had a 2020 upgraded version of my car with the same color fresh on the lot and I swiped it fast. No issues, no games, got my car paid off, got alot rebates, mad coverages, my unused portion of VSC refunded, and I'm only paying a little more than I previously did for a 2020 car with 9 miles. Good times. Highly satisfied.</text>

Great experience buying a Honda Civic. Kai was very helpful and patient. I was in and out in two hours with all the paperwork ready and the car. Kai took the time to explain every aspect of the car, take me on a test drive and answer all my questions. I Really recommend this dealership and speaking to Kai if you are not a car expert, are somewhat undecided and need some honest guidance as to what type of Honda vehicle is best for you.< /review>

Pacific Honda failed to satisfy our purchase experience at every turn. After letting the salesperson know that we had to leave by 6pm at 4pm (after arriving at 2pm for our scheduled appointment), we still did not complete the purchase. That was fine as Pacific Honda needed to complete recall repairs before releasing the vehicle. We completed the vast majority of paperwork and they promised the vehicle would be available the next day (Saturday) and they would call us when it was ready.

Saturday came and along about 2pm and I had not heard from them, so I called. It turns out they don't do recall repairs on the weekend, so the car wouldn't be available till Monday.

Monday comes and I receive a call from the dealership saying the car was "ready for pickup". It was about noon, so I went down during my lunch break. This was nothing but failure. They made my wife and I wait for 30 mins before talking to a person. The car WAS NOT READY. Despite a call to the contrary, they had not completed all work necessary to release the vehicle. The sales manager then had the gall to lay the blame on us when the message on my voicemail clearly said "Your car is ready for pickup." Finally, they lost our paperwork. So a trip that should have been 15 mins took 2 hours.

We then had to return for a 3rd time later in the week as they had forgotten to give us the 2nd key and the users manual. We were told upon going out of our way to pick up those items that it was our fault they had been forgotten because WE were in a rush to get out of there previously.

We were also promised that we would receive standard review of features in the car and that they would be contacting us to schedule this. It has been weeks now and we have not heard a word from Honda about this. We were specifically asked to mark on our survey that this review had been completed despite it not.

I would have given Pacific Honda one star, but the sales person Ryan was pleasant and informative. Every other part of the experience failed to meet expectations.</review>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>I have purchased several autos from Pacific Honda. I like the guys that work there. I love the Honda automobiles.  The only thing, was when the engine on my wife's Honda Civic blew up with only just over 3000 miles on it.  A Pacific Honda service rep admitted knowing that that year Civic had a problem that would cause that, but Honda refused to fix it because she was just over the mileage  limit. Luckily she had purchased an extended warranty on it, but had to rent a car. I feel that when a a car is within 200-300 hundred miles of the warranty mileage ceiling it should should be covered.  Especially when service personal admit to knowing about the problem.<//review>< Time>

I just wanted to take a minute to rate my recent experience at Pacific Honda. As you can see I gave it 5 stars.  This was a very smooth process from beginning to end. Not only was he extremely genuine and very comedic at times. I would like to give high praise to my salesman, Fred Zafar. He was such a good guy to talk to, even though this whole Cov-19 affected our experience to buying our dream car. Fred took his time to inform us the features of the care. Our cars purchase wouldn't be possible without his help, really really great guy hope he helps others that's in need of getting their dream car. :))</review>

Robert at Pacific Honada was amazing. I definitely feel like I got the best deal for the best car. The extra discount I got for being in the medical field really made me feel appreciated. Thank you so much Robert and Pacific Honada for my brand new HR-V😁😁😁<//Text>

Hondas are the way to go right now. Received alot of emails to trade up and pay off my car to drive something newer. My only issue was finding the car I wanted because I loved mine. But Pac Honda had a 2020 upgraded version of my car with the same color fresh on the lot and I swiped it fast. No issues, no games, got my car paid off, got alot rebates, mad coverages, my unused portion of VSC refunded, and I'm only paying a little more than I previously did for a 2020 car with 9 miles. Good times. Highly satisfied.</Review>

Was given a phone call to come in and have my vehicle appraised because there were a couple of vehicles they thought I’d like to see. They brought out a Jeep Wrangler, beautiful from the outside; got in the vehicle it smelled like smoke and had 189,000+ miles on it. And after being walked back and forth between one lot and another I waited in the used car lot and listened to the used car salesman reportedly use profanities about having too much to do and not wanting to help. I asked for my keys back and left. If he would have waited he would have known that there were a few other vehicles I was going to ask about, but I took my business elsewhere.< /text>

Had a very positive experience with Pacific Honda and in particular my salesperson Kai.  He greeted me as soon as I walked in, was entirely polite, respectful and helpful.  Very efficient getting the purchase done, and he even helped out with a ride home since I wasn't trading in my current car.  Highly recommend.<//review>

Eduardo Ibarra is the man! If your going Pacific Honda ask for him you won't be disappointed. Hooked me up on a beautiful car and it's been running perfect for a month now. Definitely going to back to get my next car off him.</Text>

I went to several different dealerships around San Diego in order to purchase my first new car. Pacific Honda was definitely all around better then the competition in my experience. I would highly recommend trying them out if you’re in the market for a new vehicle.</text>

Pacific Honda took care of me after a bad experience at a small mom and pop dealer in the South Bay. This is my second time purchasing a car at Pacific Honda and I highly recommend going there. I’d just wish I went there before going to the other dealer and save myself the time and headache, but you live and learn. Thanks to the entire team that assisted me from beginning to end.< /Text>

Jimmy delivered the Ridgeline to my house and we signed the papers here in my garage. With all the social distancing and issues floating around, they went out of their way to get the deal done. Very happy with how it worked out.

<Review>Thank you! Steve was awesome. This was our second visit to this dealer and we purchased our vehicle on our second visit. We’ve been buying cars throughout San Diego County since 1998 and we know how salespeople can change their attitude once you’re about to close the deal. Steve never did that and I appreciated that, I made my husband come back to this dealer the second time because I wanted Steve to be our salesman. Before we came here we were at a Toyota dealer and the salesman there told us it was impossible to get the deal we wanted, he was wrong. Pacific Honda sold us the car we wanted at the price we wanted. We will come back to this dealer, we will buy our next car from them. Thank you Pacific Honda for not disappointing me, I am one satisfied customer.
**Update, Second post 1/3/2021**
We came back and sold them the car we leased last year. Pacific Honda gave us more for the vehicle than CarMax offered. A day after we sold our vehicle we came back and traded our truck for a Pilot. Alexis was awesome, he helped us with the trading process. Dario was also awesome, he took time to explain how everything works. This dealership is the best, every employee we have worked with has gone above and beyond. Thank you Pacific Honda, not only did you make it easy to sell and trade vehicles, you also got us the best finance deal. We will come back to your dealership when its time to buy our teen her car.<//Review></record>

Very satisfied with the service and care I received by Kai. He was very knowledgeable, honest, and personable. He took the time to walk me through different financing and leasing options, and worked with me to come up with the best option for my situation. I’ve already recommended a friend to make his car purchase at Pacific Honda because of Kai’s service.< /review>

I had the pleasure of getting Luis Iturbide to help me.  He told me when the New Cars sit on the lot for awhile and are not driven the battery malfunctions sometimes.  He explained the Whole process to me from beginning to end.  As I was sitting waiting on my car he kept coming to me letting me know the status of my vehicle.  I sincerely appreciate Luis.  He was a Blessing to me yesterday.  He comforted  my Conscious.  You should be very proud to have such an employee as Luis.  Thank you for your 5 Star service.

They offered free pickup and delivery maintenance during covid19 and the service was beyond excellent. They also applied promotions automatically to my bill. Relaxing and smooth experience.  Very professional work!< /Review>

My 11 year old Honda Civic EX 2010 needed some significant work this time. The Low Tire Pressure Indicator always comes on while driving. Plus, the car was leaking oil on garage floor.

Yesterday 06/25/20. I called about getting my car inspected. I met advisor Jun Iwasaki . His mechanic diagnosed the problem and Jun suggested my car needed to change a new oil filter.

7:15 am waited for fixing the oil change. Around 9 am, I received  a follow up call informing me all work was complete. I picked up my car and checked the low tire pressure light was gone. Also, no more oil leaking problems.

However, today 06/26/20. The low tire pressure indicator was still on.
I still don't understand why the tire indicator still comes on while driving.

Anyway, thank you so much your staff advisor Jun Iwasaki and true appreciation the mechanic for the work done in diagnosing and repairing my car leaking oil troubles!!< /Text>

Usually I don’t do reviews but in this case I’m very happy and blessed to have found Pacific Honda as my go to for car. Everyone there was very nice and welcoming even the Manager was very professional and helpful too. Most importantly is the salesman of the month, Farhad (Eddy) went above and beyond to help me get a good deal on my white Honda CR-V-EX which I love so much and enjoy every moment of it. I’m very happy that every time I need to find a good deal Farhad always been there for me and I always walked away happy with the new car. This is the 6th cars my family and I have purchased from Pacific Honda with the great help of Farhad, he deserves more than 5 stars review if I could give him more. He always listens and goes above and beyond to make sure you get the deal and the car you love and walk away happy with the new purchase. Thank you so much Pacific Honda and Farhad for always be there for my car needs, you have never failed me, thank you so much! You are my #1 go to place in San Diego County and I don’t mind to come here even when I don’t live close to the area, you have got my customer satisfaction and trust!<//Review>

<review>My passenger side window fell down inside the door and would not budge. Since I do not have a garage i had to get it fixed ASAP. I went directly to Pacific Honda at 2pm on a Friday. The service associate, Joshua Herrera was easy to work with and courteous. He kept me informed of the progress. Amber at the service desk was so kind, cheerful and helpful on the phone and also when I arrived to pick up my vehicle. Great service and the repair cost less than expected.< /review>< Pics>

We showed up at Pacific Honda last weekend and were greeted by Marquis Moreno. We started out looking at new Honda's but eventually found a one year old used vehicle on their lot. Marquis was very helpful and friendly, and most of all (for me) not pushy. He actually listened to what we wanted and we ended up buying a car from him. We really liked his demeanor, and the support staff their were all very professional and funny. After we bought the car, they gave us an excellent reference for a local restaurant which also turned out to be awesome. Thanks Marquis, you're the best.< /Review>

AS most consumers do these days I shopped several dealerships, Pacific Honda being one of them.  Because of the ultimate professionals, Jimmy and Zach we were able to get most everything done over the phone.  I like Jimmy's patient sales approach, not your normal aggressive car salesmen mentality.  He made the experience very easy and comfortable even during these times of the Covid-19 social distancing times.  I am very excited to pick up my near car tomorrow fully ready to go, powder coated wheels and all.  The credit manager that completed our paperwork was very knowledgeable and even sold me on the alarm app which I normally wouldn't buy.  Good job!!!!  Overall we had a very pleasant experience thanks to the entire team.  Looking forward to many years of customer service when needed. Lynn Chisnell</review>

<Review>I always use the Express garage option for my regular oil change plus other services for my 2016 Honda Pilot, which I purchased at Pacific Honda. If you get there early, a half hour before the service bay opens they can usually get you in and out in an hour.

Pacific Honda Service is a very well run organization, they send reminders via email, always let me know about any other service or parts that might be upcoming or need my attention, and the work is always done correctly.

My Pilot is the first car I've ever bought new from a dealership, and the car and the service are superb.

40,000 miles on my Pilot and not one problem yet. Drives like a dream, and gets around 25 mpg on the 6-cylinder engine.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I was having issues with my car sometimes not starting and thought I'd call Pacific Honda to get it checked. I spoke with a very friendly lady named Jeremy and she told me to go ahead and bring my Honda Accord over so that they can check both my battery and alternator.

When I arrived, I was immediately greeted by a gentleman who seemed like the supervisor as he was dressed just a little more formal than the rest of the reps, asked me what I needed to have done to my vehicle and assigned my to one of the reps named josh. Within 5 minutes of Josh collecting some info from me, he and Jeremy learned from the tending mechanic that my battery was starting to go bad and was gonna need a new one.

At that point, Josh found in the system that I had purchased my battery from Pacific Honda and that it was still under warranty. So he informed me that they would go ahead and replace my battery with a new one and  that it would just take about 15 minutes to install. It only took 10. And then Josh closed out the transaction and gave me a copy of my receipt and was sent off with a warm and friendly goodbye.

Best experience ever!< /Review>

<text>I started my research online to purchase a new 2020 Honda Accord Touring and spoke with several people from dealerships on the phone.  They would not give me much information on the phone and insisted I come in person to speak with a salesman.  I was surprised most of them were too busy to talk to me and were telling me their sticker price MSRP was all they were selling their cars for.  I came across Pacific Honda on the internet and they had great reviews and had the car I wanted in black color.  I called them on the phone and spoke with a salesman name Fred, (Farhad Zafar).  Fred was so nice and friendly and was eager to talk to me about the vehicle I was interested in.  I immediately felt comfortable asking him so many questions about the vehicle and price.  He was not pushy and he didn't pressure me to buy from him.  I spoke with his Sales Manager, Mark Morrow on the phone.  He was also very friendly and I was able to discuss everything I wanted in my vehicle.  We came to an agreement on the price.  This dealership is in San Diego and I would have to drive a long way to go there when I have 3 Honda dealerships near me.  Both Fred Zafar and Mark Morrow were so attentive, super nice and professional so I decided I wanted to check out the car at their dealership.  I met with Fred Zafar in their lot.  He was delightful and he had the car ready to go for me to test drive.  Mark Morrow came to meet my husband and I and he was engaging and pleasant.  I could tell these two guys had a lot of experience in their field and were extremely knowledgeable with their vehicles.  After my test drive I knew I wanted to buy the car from Fred Zafar.  After we finished the financing, Fred Zafar took the time to go over everything in my new car.  He set up my seat positioning, my alarm to set after I walk away from my car and walked me through the navigation system, cameras and all sorts of features.  I have bought many cars in my life and never met a car salesman so compassionate about selling a vehicle to a customer as Fred was.  He wanted to make sure he answered all of my questions and I was completely happy with my new detailed and shiny vehicle.  I take the time to write these reviews because I read other people's reviews all the time to hear their real experiences.  I will refer Fred Zahar to my family and friends to buy a car.  I hope Pacific Honda's Corporate office will commend both Fred Zafar and Mark Morrow for providing me with "Outstanding Service".  This was the best buying experience I had.  Ask for Fred Zafar if you go there because he is so awesome and made me a happy customer!  Thank you Pacific Honda!

<review>I scheduled an appointment online and upon driving up, a man in white button-up, dark hair (about 5’ 7”) informed me that they had no room since they were all booked up. I asked how they could be booked up if I had a scheduled appointment and he said he would check & then he walked around for a minute & came back & told me I would have to go to the “express service” station which is basically the same as coming up as first come first serve. So scheduling an appointment is useless & that man had absolutely no sense of empathy and his customer service sucked. However, my was serviced and it looks like they did a good job & the woman at the desk was nice.</review><UserId.>112789795113506988120</UserId.></record>

Service was AMAZING. My old car broke down and my daughter referred me to DJ who had sold her a car a few months back. I was positive he wouldn't be able to help me due to my low credit and I didn't have much for a down payment. Sure enough he proved me wrong . He was able to get me a car that I'm in love with and payments I can afford . I'm still in disbelief. THANK YOU SO MUCH ! XOXO......</Review>

<user_id>104572577718458979442</user_id><text>I had an awesome experience at Pacific Honda. I called basically every dealership in the county and none could match their price. Worked with Tarig Elamin, their Internet Sales Manager. He was fantastic to work with, low pressure and really LISTENED to me.

I have a background in sales and had thoroughly researched the Honda Odyssey I was buying, so he didn't try and sell me how great the car was. He knew I had done my research and just made the whole experience pleasant and smooth.

I let him know what offers we were getting and he came in with the best offer I got, hands down.

Once we had agreed on a final price, my wife and I came down to the dealership and were in and out under 3 hours (which is very good given all the paperwork that needs to get done). Tonya, their Finance Manager, was also awesome to work with and helped speed things along for us. I am thankful that she helped us think through how much we wanted to put on a down payment vs our monthly payments. We went with her recommendation because it made perfect financial sense for my family and I am grateful she gave her input--without pressuring us AT ALL.

I am definitely recommending them to my friends who are in the market for a minivan. The experience is by far the best I've had at buying a new car (and my wife and I have bought 2 in the last 3 years).<//text><Response>{'time': 1580145834502, 'text': 'We always strive to deliver the best car buying experience to our customers, so we are delighted to see your review!

<text>Ricky at Pacific Honda! He’s awesome!
Straight forward and honest. No bull with this guy and no pressure either.
I’ve been car shopping with the wife for the past 5 wknds! Ricky was the first honest, no pressure and business orientated salesman. He won’t waste your time and he’ll make sure to work with you.
Thank you Ricky!< /text></record></dataset><record>

I was a first-time car buyer and my experience at Pacific Honda was smooth and light. Tarig and his manager were able to meet my financial needs, as well as my personal needs and wants. I am very happy with the car I am leasing while all staying within my budget. Tarig showed me about 5-6 different cars and I test drove 4 of them. I like that I was given options and he was willing to take the time to understand what I wanted. I highly recommend getting a Honda at Pacific Honda!</text>

Jessica at the Express service was a great help and I totally appreciate her honesty. She was very polite, sweet, and had a smile on her face the whole time. Thanks to her and the other girls at the Express service, I will totally be coming back to get my service done more often. I had to wait a little bit. But it was due to the fact I brought it the day before a holiday. I procrastinated and had to deal with the holiday rush. But what would you expect when you bring your car in the day before or after a holiday. I love the customer service and friendliness here.< /review>

I have never had a more pleasant experience buying a car as I did with Pacific Honda yesterday . Our sales associate,  Tarig, did a wonderful job throughout the process without ever applying pressure. He made me feel comfortable and was knowledgeable about the cars and offers. The financing department also did great, it was quick and painless. I will definitely be a returning customer.<//text>

When I went to pacific Honda I didn’t have high hopes, I was met by Kai. He introduced himself and I told him  I was looking for a Honda Civic, at first we went to look at the SI civic. I really liked the SI but I could see myself getting into trouble with it!! So I went to the civic hatchback sport and I liked it so I told him let’s give it a try and Kai and his team was able to get me into the civic, which was awesome. I got a lower payment from what I was paying with my truck, and the fact that I’m saving at least 80-120 in gas alone. Thank you Kai for all your help.<//text>

< Review>
When I went to pacific Honda I didn’t have high hopes, I was met by Kai. He introduced himself and I told him  I was looking for a Honda Civic, at first we went to look at the SI civic. I really liked the SI but I could see myself getting into trouble with it!! So I went to the civic hatchback sport and I liked it so I told him let’s give it a try and Kai and his team was able to get me into the civic, which was awesome. I got a lower payment from what I was paying with my truck, and the fact that I’m saving at least 80-120 in gas alone. Thank you Kai for all your help.< /Review>

<Text>I was a first-time car buyer and my experience at Pacific Honda was smooth and light. Tarig and his manager were able to meet my financial needs, as well as my personal needs and wants. I am very happy with the car I am leasing while all staying within my budget. Tarig showed me about 5-6 different cars and I test drove 4 of them. I like that I was given options and he was willing to take the time to understand what I wanted. I highly recommend getting a Honda at Pacific Honda!< /Text></record>

I've never been to Pacific Honda. I can just imagine how they harass the sorry customer who actually provides them with contact info. I've asked them to please stop emailing me. A robot wrote me back and reported that they could do nothing. Maybe with this review, some human might take the reigns from this automated harassment machine and PLEASE STOP EMAILING ME. Otherwise, I am open to leaving as many reviews as they send me emails. One star for the immediate response from the robot.</review>

The process of leasing our car was quick and easy.  There was no pressure, our questions were answered in an easy to understand manner, and we drove away happily in a new car.  It was a great experience, and we will definitely return to Pacific Honda in the future.<//review>

I did oil change and tire rotation on my 2019 Clarity. They put 47 psi on my tires while the spec is 36 psi. They cannot perform the basic maintenance. This was my first visit and the last one as well. I re-calibrated my TPMS.< /Text>

<review>I was sold a certified used car. Within 4 days of my purchase the steering failed and the car needed at 1500 dollar repair. Ricardo Ramirez was very helpful in trying to get the car fixed. And offered to pay half of the repair bill even thought I did not have the extended warranty Overall I feel like I got good service, if it were possible to give 10 stars I would</review>< Pics>

I went to test drive a 2020 Honda Civic EX. I had an appointment with Jimmy but when I walked in, no one even paid any mind to me. I went up to the front desk and she said Jimmy wasn’t there... Even though I was getting constant message reminders about my appointment with him. So I ended up having a nice guy named Fred show me the car I had wanted to test drive. They didn’t have the color car that I wanted and when I asked if they could have it brought in I was told that it “wasn’t possible” Something about the factory not making any more models because of the whole COVID-19 thing going on.

I felt like they didn’t really pay attention to me walking in because I look young. I’m a Marine and I’m very interested in buying the car I’m specifically looking for but they had made no attempt to work with me on trying to get the car I wanted from another Honda dealership. I’ll just have to do that myself.</review>

I waited patiently for 6 hours to get my oil leak fixed and oil exchange done on Saturday. I’m happy to drive my car off, but once I caught up to speed of over 35 MPH. Something below my car starts rattling and scraping vigorously. I went back to service, where deny to look at my car and told me to come back Monday. I am not satisfied to know that there are missing bolts and nuts that hold the undercover together. I am very disappointed.  It wasted my time and money for the weekend.</review>

<Text>I was very pleased and satisfied with the price of our 2020 Honda CRV. Mr. Zafar, Sales Consultant , at Pacific Honda listened to our needs , showed us the different pricings and after my husband and I discussed the issues, Mr Zafar had the best offer among other dealerships we had visited.  During our first day he was focused, listened , clarified and provided options. It was his good listening skills, honesty, no pressure but “ this is what we can give you” demeanor based on our needs.
With regards to orientating us to our first Honda, Mr.Zafar, took his time , walked us through the important aspects of the car and reviewed items / questions that needed clarifying. We discussed extended warranty and at the end my husband and I felt it was in our best interest and safety to purchase the service. Both retired and in our 70’s; we sincerely appreciated Mr.Zafar’s knowledge , the confidence in his product and his overall patience in educating us.  Thank you, Farhad ( Fred) AZAR..Well done..

I was a fresh Bankruptcy client there, meaning it's not easy to get financed. Other dealerships tried multiple times but not hard enough. DJ was the only one who actually cared to help and said "I will make this my mission to get you in a car". And he did. I almost gave up when he called and said that I was approved. Very fast and friendly but professional service. Thanks Pacific Honda and DJ!<//text>

<Review>I am very impressed with my most recent experience at Pacific Honda. I had been looking for a new car for quite some time and when i relied on reviews, i was a bit apprehensive however I decided to take a chance and that was the best decision!

I had submitted a form showing interest in the  New 2020 Honda Civic Hatchback Sport and instantly received communication from the Team. DJ (David Jefferson) was my point of contact and he made my experience the most efficient and professional i have ever received at a dealership. You can tell he truly cared about us not just as customers but individuals who are making a decision on an investment. He worked his magic and was able to put or apprehension at ease. Most importantly, he was not pushy AT ALL. We came back the next day after the appointment and drove off in my dream car!

Anyone interested should contact DJ! Hes one of a kind and is a true asset to the company!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I had an outstanding experience with Pacific Honda during the recent purchase of my new vehicle. I had hesitated for weeks to visit any dealership due to prior car shopping experiences but finally decided to give Pacific a try, primarily due to their great online reviews. Every aspect of the process was pleasant. Ahmed (Sales rep), Mark (Sales manager), and Samantha (Finance manager) were all such a pleasure to work with! I had a great time test driving the car, completing the paperwork, and driving off with my new car. I used Costco's Auto program which provided a transparent, haggle-free, shopping experience which relieved a tremendous amount of stress. Working with the team at Pacific really was fun though and I highly recommend checking them out!</text>

I'm only 3 years into owning a brand new car, so this is a new thing to use a dealership for servicing. As in all business dealings, establishing rapport with a human being is vital to great customer service. I've found a service rep who is friendly and helpful, relates to me as a human being, and makes sure my car has excellent service. I drive a lot, and I'm very happy with the peace of mind knowing that my car is always in tip-top shape.</review>

Worst car buying experience EVER. I bought a used Jeep, and have had it now for 6 months and still have not received my permanent plates. This hold up is not on the DMV, but on the dealership side of the house. It is close to IMPOSSIBLE to locate the right person to speak to, because when I call I am transferred 100 different times to different people who claim they aren’t the person I need to speak with. Seems to me like no one here wants to do their job. They’ve also told me they’d call me back and follow up, which has not happened yet in 6 months. I was also promised to have a daytime running light replaced upon purchase.. and same situation, I get transferred 100 different times to different people, and not one of them takes the responsibility of contacting me back or giving me any information. This is BY FAR THE WORST experience I’ve had with a dealership. I do not recommend! Take your business elsewhere!</text>

My wife changed our 2012 Honda Odyssey at Pacific Honda on Friday 08/16/2019. She thought that it would take her at least 1-2 hr to be done. So she went to a nearby market for shopping. However, the service call was in when she just entered the store, and it only passed about 25 min from check-in.  The representative told her that our vehicle had been done. Since it was super fast, I even thought that they might forget to change the engine oil. However, when I checked the engine oil later, it was really new one!!! We are very satisfied with Pacific Honda's service, and we will go with them as long as we live in San Diego. In addition, this Honda service center provides free shuttle service for customer during waiting.< /Review>

< Review>
Had a great experience buying a car. Freddi and Anthony were very low key and pleasant, no pressure tactics or any of the nightmarish stuff you associate with dealerships. I just walked in, test drove the car, and we got down to business. I’m planning to buy my next car from here as well.< /Review>

< Review>
I had the pleasure of working with Martin Oram who hooked me up with my now beloved Honda Civic. I was unsure as to if my credit would allow me to finance, however, Martin made it happen. I feel truly blessed. I went to every dealership in San Diego county and Pacific Honda has THE BEST prices. Hands down. The price of my 30,000 mi 2016 Honda Civic from Pacific Honda was less than cars of lesser quality (Kia, Hyundai, etc) at other dealerships.

I believe Honda’s are generational wealth. My very first car was my great grandmothers Honda Accord. I will have this car for many many years to come. Thank you to Martin and Pacific Honda for hooking me up with my beautiful car. I am so happy.<//Review>

<Text>I probably shouldn't say this too loud. But, I got there at 7ish on a Saturday. Thought they opened at 8. My mistake. But they got me in and out in about 45 min. AWESOME. JUST AWESOME!

I was there again today (6/11/2020). I was first in line today. The staff, as always, fast, friendly and efficient. Got me in and out again in about 45 min. I generally bring my vehicles to the dealer because they do a good job, stand behind their work and I have had bad experiences at some local shops. I have nothing but good things to say about the staff their and their work But, I got to tell ya, almost $100 for an oil and filter change seems awfully steep.< /Text>< userid>

David Jefferson was AWESOME!!!! I think because of him solely, he made the whole process as easy and fast as possible. I was dreading being at a car place for hours, but not with David. He gave me multiple car selections, found someone to finance me with no troubles, amd it didnt take hours. I have been bragging about him ever since I got my car!!!! I LOVE my car and so glad I went to Pacific Honda to see David!! Thanks again!!!<//text>

Marcelo was an incredible human from start to finish. We arrived at the dealership around 8pm and had no expectations because we had never owned a Honda before.

After test driving a few of the CRV EX's we were very impressed with the size (I'm 6'4") and features sunroof, heated seats, Apple Car Play, Automatic engine shut off, keyless entry, keyless start button, the list goes on and on.

We were expecting to never be able to meet on the numbers, but Marcelo worked for us and we felt like we got a very fair deal right then and there, a deal that we couldn't say no to!

Thank you Marcelo and Pacific Honda for your kindness and generosity this won't be the last Honda that we buy!

Got my first car today at Pacific Honda! Kai was so helpful in working with me over 3 separate visits and 4 test drives to find me the perfect fit! (A Honda Fit that is).  The service at this dealership was very quick and efficient and everyone was so friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back for my next lease.<//text>

<text>Jojie helped us with our purchase of a new Honda Civic, and made the whole experience easy and painless. We had been to a few different dealers while looking at options, and Pacific Honda was the most positive experience we had. Everyone was knowledgeable and helpful, without being too pushy, and Jojie and Ryan particularly were great. Very happy with what we got.</text>< pics>

I brought my car in for scheduled maintenance (I had an appointment), and waited while they did the job. When they found that the battery needed replacing, they texted me to authorize the replacement. In all, I was in and out of there in two hours. Quick and efficient.<//review>

This was one of the easiest car buying experiences I’ve ever had. Ishi was very helpful in showing us different Honda models and all their features. Which helped us find our dream car, he kept working with us to ensure we got the best deal and made himself available to us even when we weren’t at the dealership with his personal contact information. I will definitely return to this dealership for my next lease!<//Text>

<Review>This is my first time buying  a car completely on my own from start to finish and being that I am not too car savvy none the less Pacific Honda made this experience so easy and totally put my anxiety to rest. I must give credit where its deserve and that goes to Dj who runs the Fresh Start program I am telling ya'll he has major experience in the business if your struggling  with credit issues or dont have much credit this is definitely the man you want to see
he dont waste your time, doesnt mess around and defitneyly tells it how it is. His efforts to get you as close as possible if not the car you want are amazing... Thank you Dj for everything you rock!! After other dealers not to say any names (Mossy Honda of El Cajon) didnt even bother to try to see if they could do something for me they right away turn me away and said no and send me on my way not you didnt stop  until you found something for me I truly appreciate  good customer  service and that Pacific Honda!!

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>The service is Pacific Honda is one the best in San Diego. They are friendly and work with you to make a deal. From the moment you call to make an appointment there was a helpful representative aka Zack. Who then told us to meet with Shawn at the Dealership. Shawn had the car (HRV) we were interested all ready for a test drive. Shawn was great he was honest, never pushy, and very understanding of our situation. We had been shopping around for three months already but never closed the deal. Thats where Mark the manager comes in he was friendly and honest but he got straight to the point. He wanted our business gave us a super deal that we could not walk away from. So we signed with Samantha at finance she  made the process nice and easy. They gave us peace of mind with the extra Gap insurance and Karr alarm we got. I would recommend both for your purchase. But it doesn’t end there they gave us a great insurance rate with Allstate. Shella is the Allstate representative inside the dealership. Who knew you can also get car insurance at a dealership. Shella got us an even lower rate than what we have already. Overall it was a great experience it took a while but we have time and are very patient.

<review>This was my first time leasing a vehicle on my own at Pacific Honda.  I was extremely nervous but my sales associate, Alex, was extremely patient with me and answered all of my questions thoroughly.  Alex made me feel really comfortable and he was able to offer me an amazing deal!  I would highly recommend Alex at Pacific Honda. I appreciated the fact that my car was washed and the tank was filled. Thanks again for the great price and amazing customer service experience.</review><response>None<//response><user_id>116636213770413325731< /user_id></record>

Express service is top notch! Went on a Monday morning for my first oil change with the new car. Free shuttle service to and from my work. Service only took 30 mins and was shuttled to pick up the car when it was convenient for me. Will definitely be back!<//review>

<Text>One of the best auto-buying experiences I’ve had in 46 years! The entire staff is friendly and helpful. Big shout out to my salesperson, Jojie, for his super positive attitude and thoroughness. Great guy to work with!

Also want to recognize Tania in Finance. She helped me zip through the myriad paperwork in short order. A real professional.

On top of that, I love my new Accord Hybrid EX-L!! 👍🏻😎</Text>< gmap_id>

I currently went to this location roughly 2 days ago and upon arrival the sales man that help me his name is DJ. As I was scheduled for my appointment I of arrived 15 minutes early just to get my foot in the door, when my appointment of arrived I was told to wait 15 minutes with no concern whatsoever also in the process of speaking with him about the vehicles that were in mind he was all over the place I personally think it was very unprofessional as well as his attitude towards helping a guest (ME). I have personally never  Thought about doing a review on anything but it was very upsetting to know how unprofessional he was.  I personally think that a higher supervisor should have a talk with him as soon as possible about how he handles is guest and his job..........

Luckily (Mohamad) was there to also assist me which Muhammad was amazing and his customer service he answered all of my questions as well as let me test drive a  Vehicle. I would highly suggest if you ever do go to this dealership looking for any used vehicle that you go to Muhammad because he will actually take the time to talk to you and discuss your options and he focus on you as a high priority which I appreciate it very much<//text>

Want to thank Robert and the whole team at Pacific Honda for taking care of my trade in and getting a  car that fit my needs and the monthly payment I needed to make it work. They were recommended to me from my mechanic Mr. Lee of ECOMAX who had just recently purchased a car from them. I will definitely recommend Robert and Pacific Honda to my family and friends.</Review>

<Text>I and my wife are writing this feedback based on our experience with Honda Pacific, which has been difficult.

- We decided to lease a car and signed our contract with Pacific Honda, San Diego CA on October 27, 2019. We wanted to make our first brand new car lease or purchase from an experienced store so we could be guided through the process. After signing the contract, we brought our student IDs in order to benefit a $500 student discount and it was when the representative realized our visa type and said he should show it to the manager.
- It was understandable that the young representative was not familiar with the student visa, even though we informed that we are international, doing our masters and working at the same time before we signed the contract. After weeks of stressful waiting without knowing if the car was taken back or not, finally, we were told that we weren’t suitable for a leasing contract but we could buy the car.
- We agreed to buy the car, paid the $1000 difference (between leasing and purchase) on down payment and signed a new contract. We made this payment with our credit card in the Pacific Honda store with a Finance department representative. A week later, they told us we should have made the payment from a debit card instead of a credit card. We told that we already paid our credit card bill for that month and they asked for the statement, which we provided later.
- We couldn’t understand why our payment method was incorrect considering we made the payment with the finance department and they approved the credit card. However, we were fine because finally it was solved after we provided the statement and they approved. The following week, we realized our $1000 payment was refunded to our account with no explanation and we were back to where we started.
- Imagine, a customer wants to make a payment but the seller keeps making it hard. After weeks of trying hard, we finally could make the down payment and waited until January 8, when was the due date for the first payment to the bank. But, we weren’t informed about how we could make the payment because Pacific Honda was in communication with Capital One. When we called to have information about the payment process, we learned that Pacific Honda didn’t send the deal to Capital One on time, so the offer had expired.
- As we mentioned above, we specifically chose Pacific Honda based on their experience because we needed assistance through the process as a first-time purchaser. We believe, all the misfortune we had was based on a lack of knowledge or communication between the departments. Information given or action taken by a department was rejected by another department while we were never informed properly about what was the next. When we wanted to return the car, they said we cannot give it back but Honda can take it back if necessary. The amount of stress and unknown we had made us regret this purchase. Almost after 3 months, we could finalize the process by making the first payment in January and decided to write this feedback.
- We understand problems may occur during a sales process, which is okay. What we care is the way it’s handled and if the company is solution-oriented. Unfortunately, we couldn’t see this effort and the lack of communication within the company caused us a lot of time and stress. We are writing this feedback by hoping no one else has the same experience we had.

Regards,
Okan & Begum AKDAG< /Text>< Pictures>

I recently bought a new Honda CR-V EXL at Pacific Honda.  Fred Zafar was a great person to work with as he was so knowledgable and low key.  There was no pressure, just a smiling ease.  I used the Costco auto buying program and Fred and the manager Mark were very forthright, answered every question and made the transaction easy.  I would recommend Pacific Honda as a dealership with personnel who are professional and a pleasure to work with.<//text>

Overall, I loved the experience me and my wife had at Pacific Honda when we leased our new vehicle. They were pretty upfront about the deal and also honored the deal that they had taken off. Couple of things I did not like 1. The fact that the sales representative had setup an appointment with me at noon and he was not in the office that day and 2. They took about 4 hours to close the deal because of dealing with finance folks. This process can definitely be streamlined so the customer can be in and out in no time.</Text>

Pacific Honda overcharged me $745 and never sent the payment to my bank where I got my loan. I have called twice to try to either get this money refunded to me or sent to my bank with no result. I now have to dispute this charge with my bank due to the fraudulent charge. I do not recommend Pacific Honda.<//review>

As a first time car buyer, I am very pleased and I would 100% recommend going to Pacific Honda if you trying to buy a new car. Everyone was great; Jojie, Kai, Ryan, and their manager, they really helped me out. They were very patient and understand in what I wanted and needed. As a working college student they made it easy and comforting in purchacing something as big as a new car. Kai even helped me get really good car insurance for a great price. You cant beat this anywhere else!</review>

Took my Clarity in for a oil change. It has both an electric and gas engine. The next day I'm driving and the car auto changes from electric to the gas engine. Warning lights low oil pressure. Pacific Honda service my car and forgot to put oil in it. The worst part of it. I reached out to them via phone, text and web portal. I have received promises of a  phone call from the service  manager. No calls, no messages. You have lost a long time customer.</Text>

This was my second experience with Pacific Honda.  Three years ago I leased a new Honda Fit through them and had a fantastic experience from the moment I walked through the door. Mark took great care of me and walked me through all of the steps until I was out the door and driving home in my new car.

Well...fast forward three years and it is time to upgrade to a bigger car to accommodate my growing family.  Again, I was taken care of by Mark, but this time I was purchasing a new CR-V EX.  Mark was very transparent through the process and had the car in pristine condition.  He walked me through all the new safety features and technology included in the EX model.   It felt pretty good to drive off in a fresh new car knowing that I got a great deal.

If you are looking for a Honda and want to be treated well, head down to Pacific Honda and ask for my man Mark!!!< /Review>

I don't normally go to the dealership for my problems but I am so glad I did. I was so impressed by their flexibility, consumer service, honesty and accommodations. Originally, I called for an appointment a few days before the new year (a very busy time of year for them). They had no appointments for the entire week but the woman on the phone promised to get me in if I came in when they opened at 7AM. When I arrived the next day, I walked inside and waited maybe 2-3 minutes. Brandon greeted me and asked what the problem was. I was in to my check engine light. He told me it was most likely my Hybrid battery and that it would be FULLY COVERED by the warranty because it was less than 11 years old and under 170,000 miles. I left my car there and a few hours later Brandon called and told me the good news. He also let me know that my car would be ready around 3-4PM the next day but, he wouldn't be here so his associate Tony would be taking care of me. The next day at 9AM, Tony called me and let me know my car was ready. My experience was fast, easy and didn't cost me a cent. That deserves 5 stars.</text>

Express service was just that, speedy and efficient! They had my oil change done in 30 minutes and were friendly the whole way through! Many times, employees won’t go over my multi-inspection with me but they were sure to make sure I knew how my car was running. I usually come here and they’ve always been awesome!< /Review>

I and my wife are writing this feedback based on our experience with Honda Pacific, which has been difficult.

- We decided to lease a car and signed our contract with Pacific Honda, San Diego CA on October 27, 2019. We wanted to make our first brand new car lease or purchase from an experienced store so we could be guided through the process. After signing the contract, we brought our student IDs in order to benefit a $500 student discount and it was when the representative realized our visa type and said he should show it to the manager.
- It was understandable that the young representative was not familiar with the student visa, even though we informed that we are international, doing our masters and working at the same time before we signed the contract. After weeks of stressful waiting without knowing if the car was taken back or not, finally, we were told that we weren’t suitable for a leasing contract but we could buy the car.
- We agreed to buy the car, paid the $1000 difference (between leasing and purchase) on down payment and signed a new contract. We made this payment with our credit card in the Pacific Honda store with a Finance department representative. A week later, they told us we should have made the payment from a debit card instead of a credit card. We told that we already paid our credit card bill for that month and they asked for the statement, which we provided later.
- We couldn’t understand why our payment method was incorrect considering we made the payment with the finance department and they approved the credit card. However, we were fine because finally it was solved after we provided the statement and they approved. The following week, we realized our $1000 payment was refunded to our account with no explanation and we were back to where we started.
- Imagine, a customer wants to make a payment but the seller keeps making it hard. After weeks of trying hard, we finally could make the down payment and waited until January 8, when was the due date for the first payment to the bank. But, we weren’t informed about how we could make the payment because Pacific Honda was in communication with Capital One. When we called to have information about the payment process, we learned that Pacific Honda didn’t send the deal to Capital One on time, so the offer had expired.
- As we mentioned above, we specifically chose Pacific Honda based on their experience because we needed assistance through the process as a first-time purchaser. We believe, all the misfortune we had was based on a lack of knowledge or communication between the departments. Information given or action taken by a department was rejected by another department while we were never informed properly about what was the next. When we wanted to return the car, they said we cannot give it back but Honda can take it back if necessary. The amount of stress and unknown we had made us regret this purchase. Almost after 3 months, we could finalize the process by making the first payment in January and decided to write this feedback.
- We understand problems may occur during a sales process, which is okay. What we care is the way it’s handled and if the company is solution-oriented. Unfortunately, we couldn’t see this effort and the lack of communication within the company caused us a lot of time and stress. We are writing this feedback by hoping no one else has the same experience we had.

Okan & Begum AKDAG< /review>

<Time>1579645697574</Time><rate>2</rate><review>UPDATE: As of 01/21/20 I still have not heard back from anyone at Pacific Honda regarding either of my issues. Someone left a message below, saying to contact them, but left no name. When I call the number I get passed around and eventually leave messages for sales managers who have not called me back.

I recently purchased a pre-owned vehicle at Pacific Honda in San Diego. My salesperson, Greg, was excellent. Very accommodating with test drives, vehicle checks, etc. He was not high pressure, so I felt very comfortable with him. Everyone at the facility seemed very nice. So far, I am mostly quite happy with the vehicle, and felt I got it for a decent price.

There are just two reasons I am giving a 3 instead of 4 or 5 stars:

1. There was/is a problem with one of the electric windows. I realize I purchased the vehicle "as is"; but I discovered this problem about 2 days after I brought the vehicle home. I contacted Greg via email, and also mentioned it to a representative (whose name I cannot remember) who had called me a few days later to check in on my experience. No one ever got back to me or offered to look at the window to fix it. It is still a problem, and I can tell it's something electrical with the driver's side control, because from the passenger side it opens and closes fine. But again, I never got a response from Pacific Honda regarding this issue. Sort of makes me feel that once the transaction is done, they are done with you.

2. I just recently received a notice in the mail that they ran a credit check/report on me. I paid CASH for this car; so there was absolutely no reason to run my credit. It's no big deal, but it just shouldn't be done. Depending on who you talk to this activity can lower your score. I know of no benefit Pacific Honda would gain from doing this; but who knows? All I know is that they did run an unauthorized credit check. I called the number on the notification letter who said they would pass a message on to the dealership. I want to request they take that activity off my credit history. I have never heard back from anyone at Pacific Honda.

They have a good selection of new and used cars. And again, Greg was great and they were all very nice. However, because of the two issues above, I am doubtful I would go back to them or recommend them.

Update: You left a number in your response but not a name. Who should I ask for?<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I had the best experience purchasing a Honda Civic for my son at Pacific Honda this past weekend (9/21/19).  Marquis Moreno did an amazing job from start to finish. From the minute we drove up to the lot, we were greeted by Marquis and escorted inside to meet the Mark the manager.  We showed him the car we were interested in and he took us out for a test drive.  He was very knowledgeable about the features of the car and answered all the questions we had regarding the vehicle. He showed us different models, but we ended up purchasing the car that we originally came in to test drive.  It was a smooth process completing all the paperwork --considering that we were also trading in a vehicle.  Marquis was very professional and courteous and he did his job well.  I would highly recommend working with Marquis for your next car purchase. He was also very good about following up with us within the first week and making sure that everything was good with the car. He helped us with one feature in the car that we could not figure out and helped schedule an appointment for the Sealant. That is just EXCELLENT customer service!!

Juan and Samantha were equally great -- Juan was very honest & transparent with us. We used the Costco Auto Buying program and he worked with us on the pricing & the trade-in value  of our vehicle.  Samantha in Finance was great to work with. She explained the contract and answered all the questions that we had. She was quick in printing out all of the documents and assisted us in signing all of them.

All in all, Marquis, Juan and Samantha were an amazing team that we worked with at Pacific Honda and they made our car buying experience a very good one.  I definitely recommend anyone interested in purchasing a Honda to visit Pacific Honda in San Diego. It was such a pleasure to work with all of them.<//review>

UPDATE: As of 01/21/20 I still have not heard back from anyone at Pacific Honda regarding either of my issues. Someone left a message below, saying to contact them, but left no name. When I call the number I get passed around and eventually leave messages for sales managers who have not called me back.

I recently purchased a pre-owned vehicle at Pacific Honda in San Diego. My salesperson, Greg, was excellent. Very accommodating with test drives, vehicle checks, etc. He was not high pressure, so I felt very comfortable with him. Everyone at the facility seemed very nice. So far, I am mostly quite happy with the vehicle, and felt I got it for a decent price.

There are just two reasons I am giving a 3 instead of 4 or 5 stars:

1. There was/is a problem with one of the electric windows. I realize I purchased the vehicle "as is"; but I discovered this problem about 2 days after I brought the vehicle home. I contacted Greg via email, and also mentioned it to a representative (whose name I cannot remember) who had called me a few days later to check in on my experience. No one ever got back to me or offered to look at the window to fix it. It is still a problem, and I can tell it's something electrical with the driver's side control, because from the passenger side it opens and closes fine. But again, I never got a response from Pacific Honda regarding this issue. Sort of makes me feel that once the transaction is done, they are done with you.

2. I just recently received a notice in the mail that they ran a credit check/report on me. I paid CASH for this car; so there was absolutely no reason to run my credit. It's no big deal, but it just shouldn't be done. Depending on who you talk to this activity can lower your score. I know of no benefit Pacific Honda would gain from doing this; but who knows? All I know is that they did run an unauthorized credit check. I called the number on the notification letter who said they would pass a message on to the dealership. I want to request they take that activity off my credit history. I have never heard back from anyone at Pacific Honda.

They have a good selection of new and used cars. And again, Greg was great and they were all very nice. However, because of the two issues above, I am doubtful I would go back to them or recommend them.

Update: You left a number in your response but not a name. Who should I ask for?< /review>

<Review>We looked at a used Toyota Rav4 they had for sale.  We ended up not buying it because we need something bigger. However the sales staff in the used department were awesome. No high pressure nonsense, and when I said I wanted my mechanic to check out the vehicle, they said "Absolutely.  No problem."  You guys are great.

Jimmy was one of the best sales man I've ever dealt with.  He was honest and straight forward.  An easy person to talk to and very informative.  The process for the sale was seamless and fairly quick.  We went to another dealership previous to them and felt like I was being haggled.  This was not the case here at Pacific Honda.  They honored online deals and went above and beyond.  Will be coming back again.</text>

<review>PACIFIC HONDA IS THE PLACE TO FIND EXCELLENT SERVICE.

I have been shopping far and wide for the best price on Honda CRV-EXL and Turing for four-month until I contacted Pacific Honda to enquire about Costco customers an exclusive discount on Honda 2019 CRV-EXL.  The gentleman I talked to Mark arranged for me to meet with Dario Morla.  When I met Dario I knew it he was the right person because he was friendly, gentle, ask the right questions, listens, doesn't push, answered all my question, his knowledge of the Honda cars is phenomenal. I was surprised he could read my handwriting as I was filling out the form from across the table upside-down, and at the same time, he was entering it in his computer.  I drove HONDA for 38 years. Six new Hondas from one dealer Reachfield Honda in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This time will be my number 7 Honda.  Dario made it easy on me, he kept on going back and forth to talk with the manager, and in the end, they both gave me a price I can't refuse.  The color I wanted was not available, but another dealer has it. When I asked Dario if he can get it for me, he made it accessible without hesitation and delivered as he promised.  Dario is a great asset not only to pacific Honda but to Honda Manufacturing Co.; I will refer my friends to Honda Pacific with assurance.  I have experienced excellent service from all the people that were involved in making sales transaction smooth. Excellent teamwork, great leadership, most of all, the best salesman of them all is Dario. Thank you, Dario, for the outstanding excellent service. You are the best salesperson I have ever met.
I wish you all the best and success in your future.
God bless,

I came here to look at a few cars and Vance was the salesman who worked with me. He was genuinely friendly and knowledgeable about the different models. One car I especially liked, so he was able to provide an out-the-door price and the breakdown taking into account all the available discounts. I was hoping to spend less and became indecisive, so I left. He kept in contact by text and notified me when the price could be lowered. He never pressured me and was very patient waiting until I finally decided to get the car. Then when I went in to sign the papers, he took me to check it out, giving me peace of mind that it was exactly what I had looked at a few weeks earlier. Turns out he had even set it aside trying to figure out how he could get me the car for the price I wanted. Great guy, I highly recommend working with him.< /review>

Always a pleasure to take my car to Pacific Honda Service. I have been enjoying the exceptionally high quality of service from service managers and mechanics for 25 years, and my most recent visit was no exception, as the Honda personal made extra sure my 18-year old Odyssey would pass its smog inspection with flying colors.<//review>

< Review>
I recently bought a Honda Civic from Pacific Honda, and am so happy with my new car! I had an awesome time working with Dario Morla, and if you visit you NEED to ask for him. Before going to this location I visited two other Honda dealerships, but no one there even came close to the amazing service he provided.

I first came to this location to test drive some cars, and one of my main fears was that I was going to get pressured into buying one. Working with Dario was awesome because he didn’t pressure at all. We test drove two cars, and during the entire time he was super friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to take the time to answer all questions my family and I had. A big part of the reason we ended up coming back is because of the service, and if my family is in the market for another Honda I know where we will go! Thank you so much Dario!< /Review>

There were, however, a couple of hiccups. I had wanted a 2019 model because of the lower cost, but Marcelo found out when we're about to seal the deal that Pacific Honda only had a 2020 model. Pacific Honda should have updated its salesforce on availability of models. I wanted a cargo net. After picking it up, I went to Service/Parts to have it install. It turned out the 2020 model requires anchors, which in turn would require significant time to install. I went back to the show room. Mr. Cruz said he specifically asked the Parts folks whether anything else was required and was told "none." Mr. Choi was kind enough to let me swap the net for an organizer. If there weren't such hiccups, I would have given 5 stars. I'm very happy with the car. I really like Honda cars; this one has good handling like the last two I had.<//text><Resp>{'time': 1584371224284, 'text': 'Woon-wah, thank you for your kind review; we are happy to pass along your comments to the team here at Pacific Honda!

This is my third time for a Pacific Honda lease (fifth auto leased since 2015 between me and my adult son) and as usual every step of the way was a perfect experience. Our first contact was with Mr. Farhad Zafir, who absolutely went miles out of his way to accommodate my needs; and from walk-in to walk-out was an excellent representative of Honda and perfect salesperson. Everyone else who helped me to trade in one car and send me out the door with a 2020 Civic made it a rewarding experience in each encounter.  Mr. Zafir brought in Ms. Andrea, his manager’s assistant, who pushed every button to get to the price I could deal with and then Ms.Samantha in accounting eased my way through the tedious paperwork and best maintenance agreements for me making it much more bearable, and finally, Mr. Patrick Soto of Allstate who put the icing on the cake by giving me a whole new insurance policy for autos and home rentals that helped me so much to stay within my budget.
I can’t say enough about how great all the Honda/Allstate personnel were this trip,  it I must say  that I thought the previous experiences I had there with  Tarig Elamin and Mark Paydar  were also just as rewarding which is why I’ll ALWAYS return to Pacific Honda in future.  But the way, your service department is ALSO extremely terrific every time I’ve been there.
Thanks for this opportunity to thank so many wonderful people who really made my day. AND I LOVE MY NEW RED HONDA 🚘 CIVIC!💗.< /review>

After a bad internet experience with another San Diego Honda dealer, I found Pacific Honda and within minutes, Yvon was helping us put together a great lease deal. Our son took delivery of his 2018 Civic today and it was his first experience with a car dealer without us parents along. Yvon and the whole Pacific Honda team took excellent care of him. The price, the car, the deal, and the financing were just as discussed with Yvon on line and all of us are very impressed with the professionalism of this team. We highly recommend them to anyone looking for honest, quick, and friendly folks to do business with!</Review>

<Review>I recently had a major service at Pacific Honda for my Honda Accord 2014.
It seems that service was done without problems.
My review is for a rude service advisor Joshua Herrera. He never called me as he promised, he did not respond on my phone call and message. At the end of the service he made a fit about applying $25 appreciation certificate that I had from the previous not so satisfactory service.
Generally service department need major attitude improvement.</Review><userid>114893288523626072331</userid>< username>

It was a good experience getting a new car from Pacific Honda. Scott was the sales dude and he listened to what we were looking for and matched us up nicely with a few possibilities. It was relatively quick getting to test drive the HR-V, the car my daughter selected as THE car she wanted to drive based on safety rating and gas mileage. Samantha was great in the Finance department and we were able to get needed services (interior Scotch Guarded, exterior Teflon coated) within days of purchase. Although the car has 4-doors and a hatchback, it is sleek and stylish ... a nice first car for my daughter. Before I forget, she also just graduated from college and was able to have a $500 cash back that went towards the down payment! Scott worked hard to get us what my daughter wanted and he did a great job. Thank you, Scott & Samantha from Pacific Honda for making this experience a good one! :)< /Text>

This was a corrective automotive experience after the hard sell I got from the DCH Honda Mission Valley when I had my 15K service there in December.  The other team members I met were also pleasant and helpful.

I can't tell you about the rest of the dealership but the service department is terrific.</text>< pictures>

If I could give this place 0 stars I would! Had the worst experience getting a car hear. Got called in to change my whole loan because they couldn’t get me the apr rate they promised me! The lady in fiancées has a attitude and should be fired because her customer service alone! She talks to you as if you are a child! They sent in the black guy to talk to me because I am black! Which I felt super offended by even though is was a great guy! This place should be ashamed of themselves!!!!!!!<//review>

<Text>Service Advisor, Joshua Herrera has been my
Advisor since I had my '02 Honda Accord EX V6
purchased from Pacific Honda new.  My Service has always been excellent!   In Feb '17, another driver with NO insurance & drove for UBER was running late to pick up his passenger & was on the phone with them decided to change lanes & totaled out my Accord. I was in a left hand turn lane going 5 mph.  He definitely was at fault. Nothing happened to the other driver!  Called 911 but they were too busy to come to the accident! I was out a lot of expense. Car Rental, $2,000 for repair of Accord 1 1/2 days earlier, etc.
Spoke to Joshua H.  Told him I had to buy another car.  Again, he has provided me with "Excellent" service with my new '17 Honda Civic.  He answers
all my questions & also checks out any of my concerns. Always has a pleasant personality & smile on his face.  I am a 75 yr old Senior Citizen who
appreciates his recommendations & NEVER attempts to push something I do not need.  I will continue to go directly to him.  I have used other Service Advisors at Pacific Honda but since I have been with Joshua H,
I will not change to anyone else.<//Text>< rate>

Customer service is great can't say so much about the used car though had to take it back twice since purchase and it hasn't been 90 days yet. 1 time for the battery dying so that does not sit well with me. We will see how things go. Used or not the vehicle should have been inspected and test driven so the customer does not have issues right when they leave the lot..<//Review>

These guys made the purchase an easy and quick transaction with the best price in San Diego county. We had to turn around while on our way to another dealership. No kidding!

DJ Jefferson took the time to make sure that  I picked the right car for me. A car that I really wanted without any pressure. He made the buying/financing process of a pre-owned vehicle as painless as possible. I couldn't believe how fast the process was once he helped me choose the right car for me. I have bought cars from other dealerships in the past but this has been the most positive experience so far. I highly recommend DJ at Pacific Honda.</text>

<Text>Updated  for Service from 5 to 4 stars.  3 star service 5 star sales.

Service is really hit and miss.  It seems like they could have enough people to greet everyone who drives up and get the process started promptly especially if showing up for an appointment..  That is rarely the case.  They often take quite a while.  Last time I let my son listen to the radio and it took long enough my 2019 van had to be jumped.  While sales was 5 star service is 3.  Buy your Honda here.  Get it serviced somewhere else.

Sales experience was not perfect but initially gave 5 stars because Jimmy.   Jimmy.took great care of me. He even stayed late.  Everything.went smooth.  Just wish I could have skipped hearing about all the after sale add on items from the business manager .   She was nice and efficient but I.said I didn't want any add-ons several.times but was.told they "have to go through each item.  Seemed like a sales pitch though.<//Text>< pictures>

I've bought several Honda's from Pacific Honda over the years. This time, having Tarig to assist me was a lucky coincidence. He was great! I had wanted to get the Accord hybrid for the first time but he alerted me to the great deal Honda was offering for the new Clarity and I'm very glad he did. It's a bit of a learning curve to own a plug-in hybrid for the first time, but it has been a great car so far. Though, a recall after less than a week's ownership was a surprise.</text>

<Text>Greg Allen is an absolutely outstanding car salesman! I’ve purchased more than 20 cars in my lifetime. When I think of what I have always wanted in the salesman I work with, Greg had it all. Integrity, product knowledge (and the competition’s), enthusiasm without being intrusive, ability to adjust to my preferences, financing options, and absolute understanding of his dealership’s inventory.

When I am buying a car, there are many, many, things I feel I need to consider; but the bottom line is that I want a salesman who can help guide me along the process so I end up pleased with my purchase for many years in the future. A salesman like Greg delivers everything I want and need.

Thank you, Greg!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Great service from workers.They really do care about your car and contact you immediately if there is an issue with the car that you may want to fix. They are very punctual as well. Been going there every time my Civic needs anything done.<//review>

I purchased a 2015 Honda Accord from Pacific Honda for a little pricey, but over all I was happy cause it was a one car owner and didn't have many miles on her. The whole reason i paid so much was because it came with warranty that covers engine ,drive shaft, and transmission.THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!! NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CARS OR TRUCKS!!! RUDE!! JUST STRAIGHT CON ARTIST !! I'M AFRAID TO TAKE MY CAR TO THIS PLACE CAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT MORE DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE. MADE MY WHOLE CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE  A NIGHTMARE< /Text>

Customer service at this location is great ! My salesman Alex was extremely helpful and accomodating to the fullest. Pacific Honda went out of there way to help me out and get me into what i wanted / needed. They gave me more than what my trade in value was worth and made sure i left with a smile on my face. I highly recommend you visit this location if youre looking for a Honda. Very very satisfied. Thanks Pacific Honda , im very pleased.< /text>

< review>
Been coming here for all my service but haven’t written a review until now. Writing it now specifically because of Vince W in service.

Brought my car in for a simple oil change, but had a question about a weird popping sound I was getting from time to time when steering at low speeds. I heard there was a service bulletin for it and asked, but didn’t have the specific number to reference. He took all the extra time to help me search for it and found it. Ended up being for a year later  and not for my car, but went as far as to print it out for me and to have the techs check on it just in case. Also gave me a ton of suggestions on other parts I could replace myself if I didn’t want to do it at the dealership. Could truly tell he just wanted to help and have me be happy.

In addition I bought wiper blade inserts at the parts department and they installed them during the oil change for no extra cost. Small detail, but cool that they care enough to do it.

Definitely the only Honda service department I’ll be using in San Diego.<//review>

The staff I worked with were extremely knowledgeable. Fred Zafar was super attentive and thorough with reviewing the vehicles I was interested in, and in reviewing options. They really worked with me and my budget to get me in the car I wanted at a price range I felt comfortable with. Couldn't be happier!<//text>

If you plan to purchase a car from here, ask for Darnell Jackson! Of all the experiences I've had at dealerships, this by far was the best! He's very honest and tries to get you the best for your money. Rather than try to shove you in the first car you look at and collect his commission he really tries to fit you with a car that best fits your needs and budget! I'm very happy with his service and my purchase!! Thank you Darnell for making my first car buying experience one to always remember!!</text>

Updated  for Service from 5 to 4 stars.  3 star service 5 star sales.

Service is really hit and miss.  It seems like they could have enough people to greet everyone who drives up and get the process started promptly especially if showing up for an appointment..  That is rarely the case.  They often take quite a while.  Last time I let my son listen to the radio and it took long enough my 2019 van had to be jumped.  While sales was 5 star service is 3.  Buy your Honda here.  Get it serviced somewhere else.

Sales experience was not perfect but initially gave 5 stars because Jimmy.   Jimmy.took great care of me. He even stayed late.  Everything.went smooth.  Just wish I could have skipped hearing about all the after sale add on items from the business manager .   She was nice and efficient but I.said I didn't want any add-ons several.times but was.told they "have to go through each item.  Seemed like a sales pitch though.</Text>

I recently traded in a 2011 CR-V toward a newer Accord, and Tate Mackenzie was my salesperson/guide. He was great! He explained things carefully and made sure I understood my options. He had a friendly and genuinely no-pressure approach to our interaction. I left in a car that I am very happy with. Thanks, Tate!< /text>

<text>I recently leased a brand new 2019 Honda Odyssey from Pacific Honda and could not be happier with my experience.   Having done my research, I reached out to Pacific Honda with the specifics of what I wanted.  Pacific Honda responded to my inquiry right away and was very straightforward on what they were able to offer.  At the end of the day, their offer was by far the best.  Once we decided to move forward, the finance application and taking delivery of the vehicle went quickly and smoothly.  We had the pleasure of working with Fabrice who was very friendly and made sure we had all of the information we needed about our new Odyssey.   If you are looking for a dealer in Southern California for your next Honda, I highly recommend Pacific Honda.<//text>< name>

Many thanks to Farhad and DJ at Pacific Honda. They were both incredibly friendly and professional. And Farhad did a fantastic job of explaining the details of my car's lease and of my actual car itself. Thank you for turning a stressful endeavor into a great experience, and I couldn't be happier with my newly leased car.< /Text>

Amazing experience! Our sales man was very relatebale and actually listened to where we are financially and what we are looking for. He was so sincere and patient with us, we test drove the Honda Civic and decided this was the one we wanted if in our budget. My car I was trading in was a safety hazard at this point and we really needed to lease a new car. You could tell he was concerned too and wanted to help. He went back and forth to his boss multiple times because he didn't want us to walk out and make this work for us. He ended up pulling as many strings as he could for us so we could buy what we wanted. He found a way to work with our budget and use my car as a trade in, his boss was a sweetheart too and very sincere. I felt heard and not dismissed. I didn't expect walking out that day with a brand new car but they did the best job working with us. Very satisfied. Go to Honda and ask for Dylan!<//text>

<Time>1579190463927< /Time><Rating>4< /Rating><text>I was turning a lease car into a buy after my 36 month lease was up. The didn't tell me they needed car insurance as part of the deal. Had to go on their computer at the dealership to look it up. My paperwork was at home. I have AAA and only a card. Sort of upset me. They should tell you what you need before getting to the dealership. Once we agreed on terms for the purchase it took about 30 mins for them to prepare the paperwork. Customer service said only 10-15 mins. I'm  OK with that. Everyone is nice at this dealership and there really is no haggle with the price as what they offered was indeed fair. I work in defense in contracts so I know a good deal from a bad one. While I waited it seemed they were selling a decent amount of cars. once paper work was ready it was easy to sign documents and then be on my way. I shopped originally at wall honda dealerships and this one and poway are the best. I would say Escondido is the worst. Hope this helps.< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
In 2010, I bought my car through Pacific Honda, and have been servicing it there since then. The quick service for oil change is very convenient, I went there on a Saturday, an hour later my car was taken care of. The staff is very kind and helpful. They always give you good advice on what to do and do not charge more than necessary. I totally recommend Pacific Honda.< /review>

<Review>First off I dislike writing reviews, especially for car dealerships, but this review is deserved and well justified. I'm quite adamant on specific aspects of a car and Pacific Honda of Kearny Mesa delivered due to a certain employee they have, Ahmed Adel. I appreciate his efforts in looking out for the consumers. He did not try to pull any tricks and he made a deal or transaction happen. If not for Ahmed's excellent customer service skills, the deal would have never been closed. He went the extra mile with his manager (unsure of her name) to find the color I wanted for the HRV at a different dealership. The lengths and hoops that Ahmed went through in order to close a deal was excellent. He has a professional and kind personality that you don't see in car dealerships. I would recommend this dealership and Ahmed to anyone who needs to purchase a Honda. Best Honda dealerships, from the last one I did not want to own a Honda anymore, but Ahmed and Pacific Honda changed my mind. Thank you for making me an owner of my HRV and delivering amazing customer service!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

He's very honest and tries to get you the best for your money. Rather than try to shove you in the first car you look at and collect his commission he really tries to fit you with a car that best fits your needs and budget! I'm very happy with his service and my purchase!! Thank you Darnell for making my first car buying experience one to always remember!!< /Text>< name>

<pics>None</pics><Review>Corn and Zach at Pacific Honda truly made my first car buying experience as easy and pain-free as possible. After contacting dozens of dealerships, I ended up deciding between Pacific and another local one. I went to both, and the difference in customer service was HUGE. I had been treated rudely and talked down to at the other one, so I immediately went to Pacific Honda. Pacific Honda really keeps their word and doesn't try to scam you with "mandatory" packages or fees. Everyone is super friendly and does everything they can to make sure you're buying the right car.< /Review>< Name>

I want to give a special shout out to DJ in sales. He went above and beyond in his job. He was honest the entire time. No hidden fees or stipulations that weren't discussed before the purchase of my new 2017 Honda civic hatchback. I'm in love with this car and want to thank him for making it possible for me to drive this car.< /Text>

Had an appointment to view/buy a car and I didn't find out that they sold it the day before until insaw that the car they brought for me to test drive was different. What's the point of an appointment? They could have at least called me before I left work early to make THEIR appointment time.</Review>

I was upset that it wasn't clearly disclosed to me at the time of sale but I was outraged to find out that the KARR Alarm wasn't even installed on the car.  But that's only part of the story. Very dissatisfied with the experience.<//text><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My girlfriend and I went in hoping to lease new cars. Her old one was at the end of its rope and this was to be my first vehicle. Dario was very helpful. He was laid back and easy to talk to and very informative. He helped us get the best deal for our situations. He was even able to accommodate us by letting us keep one of the vehicles at the dealership for a few days since our current apartment at the time only gave us one parking space, we were gonna get the keys to a new place with 2 parking spots in a few days and Dario was able to help us out with this. The entire experience was quite pleasant and the staff made it all very easy.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909</gmap_id></record>

<text>Called Pacific Honda for a trade-in and got linked up with Yvon who honestly was great to work with. Not the typical salesperson you’d normally dislike.. he was straight forward, very informative with what would best suit me, and easy to talk with. If you’re in the market or just want to look at a car ask for Yvon for a painless and smooth process. The finance was also a breeze with Anthony. Only downside is purchasing a brand new car, I’d think getting complementary servicing for a year or two like Toyota does their sales would be standard. This doesn’t exist as they only offer a small discount on your first service if you write a review which in my opinion is kind of lame and could care less about. Hence my review is just stating a great experience being helped by Yvon and an easy process in general that I would recommend Pacific Honda to anyone. Super happy with my new Civic EX hatchback!< /text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

<review>Pacific Honda was the best new car purchase I have ever had over the last 40 years buying 12 cars. Thank you.   I used my USAA buying service-and when i noted some differences in price offerings within the San Diego Metro area-i asked if Pacific Honda would match the lowest price-and they did.  It was truely the first time-that I got a "NO Pressure" sales process.  I greatly appreciate it-because I do not like the hasssle of any high pressure sales. I don't mind paying a fair price-and i felt I got a fair price.  I will definately return to Pacific Honda for any future purchase.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Josh Herrera was by far the most transparent, concise, and efficient car service employee I have ever worked with. I can't imagine going to a different dealership for repairs in the future.< /Review>

<text>If I could give ZERO stars I would.  DO NOT go here.  RUN.  I walked away with a car.  Drove from the valley all the way to San Diego.  3 months later was told I didn’t get financed.  Yo Yo financing! Do not come here and avoid  DJ at all costs.  I have never in my life seen anything like this.  I had dealerships telling me situations like this just shouldn’t happen anymore.  We don’t allow anybody to leave our lot without FIRST financing them.  It’s not worth the headache.  Car salesman will be a certain way but THIS is a whole new low.  I’m a single mom with a handicap son.  Just avoid this dealership.  When I can make dealerships and sales people gasp and look at me in disbelief you know your dealing with a new kind of low.  There are plenty of dealerships that will work with people.  NOT this one.  Be safe and be careful.  Tread carefully and seek out an attorney if you do buy from them to ensure you are TRULY financed.< /text>< user_name>

Unfortunately the situation didn’t turn out well for either party. With respect to your contention that Yo-Yo financing was implemented, we unequivocally disagree as we never offered an alternative but to return the vehicle. With the understanding that you traveled over 500 miles to purchase a vehicle as a referral from your attorney we are sorry for what transpired and wish you the best in your quest for a new vehicle. Your continued insinuation of inappropriate and fraudulent sales practices are unwarranted and slanderous.

<Text>Absolutely no hassle, no haggle, no BS shopping experience, as promised.  Absolutely simple car buying.   I was frustrated after visiting different dealers who weren't honoring prices they supposedly would match, and then tacked on additional overages.   Not here.  Nice people too.  I'll gladly do business here again.   Much appreciated.   Thank you.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Had a fantastic experience with Mike Peters at Pacific Honda.  Mike knew right off the bat that we weren't buying the first time we met him due to closing on a house.  He was understanding and not pushy at all.  We went back as soon as we were good with the closing and bought from Mike.  It was a simple and easy process.  They were able to meet all of our needs.  I highly recommend buying from Mike!<//text>

<review>The people who helped me out, individually, were each amazing (Samantha H, Dario, and Scott, specifically, but I also dealt with other employees as well). Scott helped me with finding the right car for me, and went over the features of the cars and how they fit me. Dario helped me with getting my credit approved, which wasn't easy, given what my credit is. Samantha went over the paperwork with me, and made sure I understood all the options I had for the car and all the other details (security features, what happens at the end of my lease, etc).

However, the most frustrating part about my experience was the poor communication, or lack thereof. I had to give my information (address, contact info, income, references) multiple times to different people. After about 4 times giving my info, Dario finally managed to get a deal that I could agree to. Additionally, after I was approved, I received little instruction on what to do next. I was not told what information I would need to bring in, which led to a last minute scramble to find it all in time (which I still didn't).

Despite these frustrating periods, my overall experience was positive. I got a great car that I love for a payment that's good for me. Now I guess I just need to wait until I need service on the car to see how that branch of Pacific Honda handles.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

This is a review for their service department. Not sales.

Quick summary: If you want a regular A or B service, DO NOT COME HERE!

Long story: I made an appointment for a B service. After pulling over their service line, they told me there would be a wait of three to four hours. I said I had an appointment. They said sorry we only do this kind of minor service at the express line and don't take the appointment for minor service. I said but I had an appointment. They said, well, it does not count and the appointment system should not be relied upon...

Bottom line: very poorly managed service department.  This is my first time and will be my last time visiting their service center.< /Text>

I leased two cars from Scott Steven and I have to say he made everything go smoothly. I just recently called him and told him I had a problem with my stereo and he told just to come on in. He took a look at it and was able to fix it ASAP! I highly recommend him!</text>

If you're looking for a car go to Pacific Honda and definitely ask for Brooks Simpson. He really made both of our car buying experiences easy and hassle-free. No pressure at all here!
Plus we know we both got great deals on our cars as we did A LOT of research first. Thank you Brooks, from me and my sister!<//review>< Name>

Pacific Honda is great! Kevin Robinson helped me and my wife both get brand new cars. He got us the best deal possible and provided excellent service. My wife and I couldn't be any happier. Our brand new civic and brand new accord are running very smoothly, we will definitely be back in a few years when we are ready to upgrade.< /Review>

They said, well, it does not count and the appointment system should not be relied upon...

Bottom line: very poorly managed service department.  This is my first time and will be my last time visiting their service center.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1546450759045, 'text': 'Thank you for visiting us for your vehicle service needs.

< review>
I purchased a used car from Pacific Honda's. I was initially impressed by the speed at which the transaction took place.  Unfortunately,  when I reviewed the documents a day later I noticed a charge of 995.00 for a KARR alarm.
I was upset that it wasn't clearly disclosed to me at the time of sale but I was outraged to find out that the KARR Alarm wasn't even installed on the car.  But that's only part of the story. Very dissatisfied with the experience.</review>

<review>I took my car to Pacific Honda Service for back tire brake pads to be changed since I started to hear squeaking noise from the back tires.  They performed a brake check and 21 points check on my car.  The back brakes did not require any new brake pads.  The squeaking was due to me driving in error in D3 mode causing the temporarily squeaking.  I was charged only $42 for the brake charge.  Very happy except for the 1 1/2 hours wait time.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Absolutely no hassle, no haggle, no BS shopping experience, as promised.  Absolutely simple car buying.   I was frustrated after visiting different dealers who weren't honoring prices they supposedly would match, and then tacked on additional overages.   Not here.  Nice people too.  I'll gladly do business here again.   Much appreciated.   Thank you.< /Review>< user_id>

I would highly recommend Eduardo Ibarra from Pacific Honda. The fresh start program they offer was such a blessing considering life and its unexpected surprises it gives one. The process was smooth and got me into the car I wanted as well as the car payment I wanted! How often does one get that especially when one doesn't have the best credit score or a huge down payment to put down on a used car? I can't wait to get this car paid off because I know where I would go back for my next car! Quality service and genuinely have people that care about getting their customers into a car of their choice without the pressure of committing to something they are not satisfied on purchasing.<//text>

I purchased my first new car (2017 Honda Civic) and I am absolutely in love with it. I got an amazing deal and it was all due to the help of Fred Zafar. He was so patient and kind with answering all of my questions and was never pushy with anything. He tried his best to make sure that I got the best deal that I can get and I'm honestly very grateful that he went back and forth so many times to help get his manager to agree to the price that I was offering. Fred was very accommodating when I told him I would not be able to make it in until 7:30pm - his shift ended at around 3pm and he stayed until past 10pm to help me with my car! He even pulled up the cars that I wanted to consider right next to each other so that it would be easier for me to compare the colors and decide what I liked best! He stayed after I signed the papers to show me all the car functions and made sure I was happy with every aspect of it before I drove off. Super grateful for all of his help!

Fred was a genuine person and I highly recommend him if you're in the area for a new car! Definitely recommending my friends to him in the future!</review></record></dataset><record>

Mark Morrow was very helpful in helping me find and purchase a car that would help me meet all of my needs. He made the buying process very easy and had everything ready when I came to make the purchase of my new Honda Pilot.  I did not feel pressure and got a great deal.  Mark went over the car with me in detail and even help me set up personal settings before sending me on my way.  I got a great deal on my trade in too. I highly recommend Pacific Honda and ask for Mark Morrow.</review>

<text>We couldn’t be happier with our new used vehicle that we purchased from you today. What’s amazing is we walked onto to your lot to just look, knowing we had 3 other car appointments that day. We ended up having to cancel all of our appointments because we were so pleased with our experience with you. Ricky and Lenny were top notch.  Super friendly and helpful and extremely accommodating to our every need.  We are a huge Honda family, and are now excited to have another beautiful dependable vehicle from you.  We have always had our vehicles serviced by Pacific Honda’s Service Department and appreciate their phenomenal staff too.  This is our second vehicle purchased from your used car center and we are absolutely thrilled with it.    We are happy to add another dependable car to our family of Hondas and can’t thank you enough for such a wonderful car buying experience today.</text>< user_id>

Great service. I have brought my cars in for oil changes/checks for years and always receive very professional, courteous and friendly service. In addition, all employees are very happy to answer any questions I have. All of the Express team are so knowledgeable and helpful.
Recently, I brought my CRV in for the driver's and passenger's replacement airbags due to the recall.  I also received great service from all.
I've always had excellent experiences with Pacific Honda.< /text>

<Review>Personnel at Pacific Honda are very friendly and professional. In spite of being late 15min to my appointment  (due to crazy traffic on 805 during rush hours traffic) I received a friendly and professional greeting from one of the service advisors  (Jerremie Minter; Service Drive Manager) who went patiently over my  B 1 2 type service, and answered every one of my questions. This is my 1st encounter with the personnel at Pacific Honda and I highly recommend this location.</Review>< pics>

Had a great experience. Needed to replace two front tires and some servicing. Randall at the service counter was very helpful in recommending what was important and the car was done promptly. The rep at the store was really helpful too, when I wanted to try out a seat cushion. I am really happy with the work and the car is driving beautifully.< /review>

My husband and I had a wonderful experience at Pacific Honda and it is all due to Marquinuius or Marq "Q".
He was incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and helpful.
Ask for him and you will be glad you did :)< /review>

I just leased my Honda EX from Pacific Honda. The entire experience was very pleasant, and professional. The staff were very helpful and wanting to to the right thing for me as a customer. I highly recommend visiting them if you are thinking about a Honda accord which I think is an awesome car. I would definitely go there again for my next purchase.< /Review>

< Review>
The people who helped me out, individually, were each amazing (Samantha H, Dario, and Scott, specifically, but I also dealt with other employees as well). Scott helped me with finding the right car for me, and went over the features of the cars and how they fit me. Dario helped me with getting my credit approved, which wasn't easy, given what my credit is. Samantha went over the paperwork with me, and made sure I understood all the options I had for the car and all the other details (security features, what happens at the end of my lease, etc).

However, the most frustrating part about my experience was the poor communication, or lack thereof. I had to give my information (address, contact info, income, references) multiple times to different people. After about 4 times giving my info, Dario finally managed to get a deal that I could agree to. Additionally, after I was approved, I received little instruction on what to do next. I was not told what information I would need to bring in, which led to a last minute scramble to find it all in time (which I still didn't).

Despite these frustrating periods, my overall experience was positive. I got a great car that I love for a payment that's good for me. Now I guess I just need to wait until I need service on the car to see how that branch of Pacific Honda handles.</Review>

Easiest and fastest experience with buying a car, ever. Exceptionally positive experience. I worked with Moose, who made the whole process stress-free and seamless, which I didn't think was possible when it came to buying a car. He was terrifically knowledgable and friendly, knew the answers to all my questions, and was able to address all of my concerns. I would certainly buy another used car from this establishment, and would recommend it and Moose in particular to anyone who is in the market to purchase a used car.< /Review>

Just had a terrific experience having my Honda Pilot serviced.  Customer service at Pacific was exceptional, everyone was friendly and the service was completed much quicker than I expected.  The Enterprise rental counter is now right next to the service windows so picking up a loaner was super easy.  Love this place!<//Text>

I bought a new car here -- 2013 Accord Coupe -- I feel that I got a good deal because it was one of the last 2013s on the lot.

Pros:

--My salesman Scott was very nice and not too high pressure.
--There was a small scratch on the back bumper. They took care of it (I think maybe they repainted the bumper) and even put me in a rental car overnight for free.
--The service advisor was very pleasant to deal with.

Cons:

--My biggest problem was dealing with the F&I (Finance and Insurance) person. There was a very high-pressure pitch to buy:
--extended warranty (she made it sound like my Accord would blow up the day after the factory warranty expired...I didn't know that Honda made such junky cars)
--maintenance plan
--door ding plan (no kidding)
--Lo-Jack
--window VIN etching

Even though I said "no" several times, the pressure continued throughout the pitch. It was not a pleasant experience.

--As I mentioned, they needed to keep the car overnight, and gave me a free rental, which was nice, but when I picked it up the next morning it was covered with water drops from being outside overnight. I had just washed and waxed the car and was not happy about this.

An observation, not sure if it's a pro or con:
--The service department was very, very busy when I only the car there to get the bumper scratch repaired. Although they seemed pretty efficient, I would have a little concern about getting work done there on a regular basis. Maybe they're busy because they're good, or it could be that they have a central location in San Diego.<//text>

<text>Service could be much better!  Took my CR-V into the Express Oil Center the other day because I am trying to do all of my service at the dealer, and also because I've had bad experiences at Jiffy Lube in the past. The policies and management appears to have changed at Pacific Honda as all cars must not line up at their main service center, even if they are just coming in for an oil change. This seemed a bit ridiculous to me (and many other customers waiting in line) because we had to pull our cars into the main service garage, only to have them moved over to the express garage by the employees. It would have made more sense to do it the old way, i.e. let the express customers wait in line at the express center. To me, this seems like a very poor management decision. I arrived at 6:40 AM (they open at 7 and was second in line. My car wasn't over to the express center until ~7:10 am and my oil change and tire rotation took about 45 minutes. As usual, they tried to get me to pay $55 for a cabin air filter (these cost less than $10 and take 3 seconds to replace or clean out). I find it a bit insulting and unprofessional that they try to upset customers on things like this. However, I don't have much choice as to where I get my oil change, so I'll probably have to keep going back here. Hopefully, management will get their act together by my next oil change.</text><Time>1530131257433< /Time><GmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909</GmapID>< resp>
{'time': 1530203365047, 'text': 'Tyler - We apologize for the experience but we had to make a change based on unexpected volume that may occur in Express. We have to avoid creating an unsafe situation when the driveway is blocked and does not allow access in or out.  By bringing the vehicles into the main drive we can control how many vehicles are lined up at any one time. We have regular visits by the fire department and want to avoid a citation along with an unsafe situation. I hope this explains the “poor management decision” and it also allows us the ability to provide all required services a vehicle may need.  Ex: vehicle recalls, certain fluid changes that Express cannot perform.'}< /resp>

Great place to get a car!  My wife and I were looking to buy our first minivan and I was not looking forward to it.  The salesmen at Pacific Honda who helped us were both professional and helpful and we never once felt pressured.  Steve gave us a great breakdown of the Odyssey and, when we came back the next day, Ted helped us get to an offer we couldn't refuse.  The dealership had a very low stress atmosphere and my wife and I both felt we were customers and not just consumers.</text>

Marc was a great help.  He and Kat worked hard to locate the exact vehicle I wanted (Honda Fit EX six speed in grey).  When it came in, they stayed focused on scheduling a test drive time that worked for everyone.  Samantha in the finance department did an extra good job of advising me on configurations of the title of my new car, as it is a company car.  I appreciated the help of such an experienced staff.<//Text>

I have been coming to this service venue for years and have been consistently met with professionalism and integrity. Once there was a serious issue that could have escalated into an intense dispute... nonetheless, I felt that I was treated fairly. It is always a pleasure working with James Gibbard and his manager Jason Peabody. I am planning on continuing to service my car at this location.<//Text>

I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for  honest people with top notch customer service.  A huge thank you to Jorjie  who never gave up and went above and  beyond to make sure I got a the best deal for a car I really wanted. Lawrence was just as great with answering my questions and helping out when Jorjie was not around. Both are very friendly and helpful and wonderful asset to the sales team. I would definitely return in the future..</review>

Just traded in my Subaru that was INCREDIBLY  upside down for a brand new accord with 0 miles and way more features and ended up paying LESS. I’ve bought 3 cars in the past 4 years and this is the first anxiety free experience I’ve had signing loan documents. Thank you!!</review>

<text>Me and my husband had an incredible experience at Pacific Honda. We dealt with Dario Morla.  He And his supervisor Mark took care of us and treated us very kindly and respectfully.  Dario went above and beyond what we expect it. We will definitely be dealing with Pacific Honda and Dario in the future and would recommend them to everyone.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909<//Gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate>< Pics>

I had one of the best car buying experiences at Pacific Honda.  I was not hassled nor forced into buying something right away. After I went here to look, I shopped around at other dealerships as well. Due to their outstanding customer service, I decided to make my purchase with them.They took their time and made sure that I was comfortable. Lawrence was very patient with me and knowledgeable about the car that I wanted  and he even remembered the color I wanted when I came back! If you're shopping for a Honda, I highly recommend that you do it with Pacific Honda!</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Ted Cosby was excellent.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the process of our deciding whether to buy a Honda Civic. He provided us with a lot of information and was great in demonstrating how everything worked when we drove the auto around. He never pressured us in any way but seemed interested in our finding an auto that would fulfill our needs and that we would enjoy driving.  We returned to Pacific Honda rather than going to another Honda dealership when we decided to buy the auto, because we wanted to go through the contracting process with him.  He is a true gentleman - very courteous, friendly and trustworthy.  We met with him two or three times in all.  He even gave us his cell phone number in case we had any questions.  He was always happy to hear from us and provided excellent service.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This review is for their service department. I purchased a 2015 Honda CRV from another dealership, but I have been using this location for my service needs. Every time I come in I am welcomed with a smile and helpful attitude from each person I encounter throughout the process. The techs always explain in detail the services they are performing and why. This gives me a sense of security that I am not being ripped off or swindled as other car repair companies can be with women. Pacific Honda's prices are also competitive, and between that and their excellent customer service I will always choose them for my car needs.<//review>

Super friendly and helpful and extremely accommodating to our every need.  We are a huge Honda family, and are now excited to have another beautiful dependable vehicle from you.  We have always had our vehicles serviced by Pacific Honda’s Service Department and appreciate their phenomenal staff too.

I have purchased 3 cars from Pacific Honda since 2015 and each and every time has been a great experience and they do everything they can to ensure that you are getting the best deal and that the process is as pain free as possible.  So if you're thinking of buying a new or used Honda, you can't go wrong with Pacific Honda.  Eduardo Ibarra, one of the finance managers, was amazing and he made the whole experience easy and fun for me and my son, who was buying his first car.  Thank you Pacific Honda, you're the best!!!<//text>

< Review>
Went in to help family get into a new car. We knew what we were looking for and weren’t walking in without doing our research. Knocked off two stars because the sales manager seem kind of rude since we were young. Before leaving the lot we inspected the car and noticed scuffs on the grille and the manager claims “it’s on his other vehicles too” but was in fact wrong, however he rearranged to get it fixed. You would expect your new car to be in good condition. Finance person was nice but a little pushy, she kept asking us reason as to why we didn’t want to buy the extra security system and using scare tactics. We just wished she respected our decision the first time. Everything was going so well in the beginning don’t understand what went wrong. To our sales person Scott, you went above and beyond.</Review>

Samantha in finance Amazing as well!!!  Now the salesmen on the new car lot not so great and were a bit dismissive. Didn’t seem interested in my business at all. Overall Lawrence and Samantha made my experience here a Great One!!!!<//review>

I was referred to Brooks Simpson by my best friend and this was by far the best experience in buying a car that I have ever had! He is very helpful and did everything he could to find me the car I wanted and could afford with my budget. I highly recommend working with Brooks, and you will be so glad to have him help you! Thanks Brooks!!!</text>

Superior Honda service!  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is due to the LONG WAIT. I made an appointment to drop off my car at opening (7AM) on a Saturday,  yet it still took 20 minutes to get the car up to the service writers. They seemed fully staffed...maybe it's not like that on other days...maybe they need to upgrade the building to provide more lines of cars and more service writers. All in all, though,  a finely tuned business.<//text>

I recently bought Honda Accord 2016 model for my wife and was glad I met Jesus (one of the person, I interacted at Pacific Honda).  It was great experience buying a new car but you need to do little research on your own.  They follow up on the appointments and assisted in providing me lot of options to match my deal and finally accepted one of them.  Got correct car, color, model, etc and quite happy with it.  I would highly recommend anyone looking to buy a new Honda to stop by Pacific Honda as it was good and timely experience :).<//Review>

<review>Pleasant experience with the Internet sales team.  I worked closely with the representative named Max.  Most communication was via email and some telephone.  When I went in person to buy the car the service was great and although I didn't get the color I was looking for in the 2016 version I was notified the 2017 version of the Pilot just came out and was able to upgrade to that.  Overall I'm very pleased with their service.  Thank you.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

First time leaser here- Pacific Honda was our first stop, my gracious mother & uncle joined me to view cars, where we were graciously approached by Pierre.  Pierre was awesome, and easy to talk to. He's very knowledgeable about the all of the Honda vehicles, and especially the Civics which I was interested in.  He was able to answer all of my questions promptly, and point out little things you wouldn't think to ask about. Pierre & Pacific Honda's service was spectacular, and we truly appreciated the speed & attentiveness of the whole process- I am looking forward to my future lease trade in & perhaps purchase with Pierre.... He's the bomb! :)
I LOVE my new Civic!<//Text>

No hard sell, and when I did say I was going to look elsewhere (I had actually planned to go from there to CarMax), Lenny came in and sweetened the deal to where I couldn't walk away.The financial part was easy and professionally done by Michelle in their business office that day.

Mark Morrow was very helpful in helping me find and purchase a car that would help me meet all of my needs. He made the buying process very easy and had everything ready when I came to make the purchase of my new Honda Pilot.  I did not feel pressure and got a great deal.  Mark went over the car with me in detail and even help me set up personal settings before sending me on my way.  I got a great deal on my trade in too. I highly recommend Pacific Honda and ask for Mark Morrow.</review>

On Saturday, our 2009 Odyssey battery light came on, which basically meant the alternator was not charging.  We pulled into Pacific Honda service without an appointment and they initially said they were booked.  We were just going to leave it there and rent a car until the Odyssey could be repaired Tuesday after Labor Day.  They were open until 5pm Saturday and this was around 2pm.  As we were making plans to rent a car, they notified us that a technician had become available.  They were able to diagnose and repair our Odyssey by 5pm on Saturday.  Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!

Best Honda Dealership in California. Brooks got me the best price in So Cali and made everything easy, simple and seamless. Brooks also had the best financing options available, and beat even my military and USAA alternatives. If you want the best car, deal, rates and experience, go to Pacific Honda and work with Brooks (Convoy Street in San Diego).  Brooks is the best car salesman that I have ever worked with and should get 10 stars!!<//Review>

I can only imagine what these good people at Honda  have to deal with when they deal with people with bad credit.

Having said that, my experience was amazing! I went in not knowing what kind of car I wanted. I visited several times and there was one man who was extremely patient with my annoying ways. D.J., who is the Fresh Start Department Manager, took so much time explaining to me what I needed to do to narrow down my choices, since I had way too many. I decided on a Acura MDX after so many visits. His patience was unyielding, and the knowledge he has regarding each vehicle was just unbelievable. I drove away with my car today, feeling so grateful, and at the same time, extremely apologetic for all the time he had to take for me. When I buy my next car, wherever D.J. lands, I will be working with him again, and I will definitely refer my friends to him.

Thank you so very much, D.J.!< /Review>< pics>

Pacific Honda is great!!! If you go there with the intention of finding a good deal on a car, ask for Eugene. He did an amazing job getting us to where we wanted to be, and was a pleasure to work with. Eugene is your man if you want a great deal on a new Honda!< /Text>

<review>Pacific Honda is by far the best Honda dealer in San Diego. I was looking for a new 2016 accord ex black on black and went to acouple dealers around San Diego til I found the right price. They accepted the offer I made and they're financial staff is great. They always try to help you with everything you need and don't sell you with things that are unnecessary. They're sales people are great too, help you to find the perfect car without feeling pressured. I highly recommend Pacific Honda to everyone looking for either a new or used car!!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I will NEVER recommend this dealership. This is my last time dealing with Pacific Honda and Honda in general. I WILL NEVER BUY OR LEASE FROM YOU AGAIN! Twice I've leased from Pacific Honda and twice I've been TOTALLY RIPPED OFF! There are 4 of my family members in Texas that drive Honda's. After hearing about another horrible experience with Pacific Honda.

Not only did I stay loyal to the same brand. I stayed loyal to the dealership as well. In addition to this, I rented a hotel room in San Diego, paid for a dog sitter, and drove all the way to San Diego from LA to pick up this car. Why did I do this? First and foremost to stay loyal. Second, to receive this amazing discount that was noted/sent to me. Not only did I not receive this discount, but I paid more than the initial price of the car. I came to San Diego expecting to pay less than the $282 I was paying for my previous car (which was more expensive), but I left with a lease that is $327 a month. That's $45+ more than my previous car. This after being told that I would receive this amazing discount no matter what. Initially I was told that my lease would be the same amount as my previous lease. This after they tried to lease the car to me at 3 different prices before this price was quoted. This, also after testing the car, thinking about it, making sure it was the one for me instead of the Lexus I nearly leased. This, also after thinking I was getting the car at one price for 2 hours (until they ran a credit check). Negative credit check or not, I rented a hotel room in San Diego, paid for a dog sitter, and drove all the way to San Diego from LA to pick up this car. Why not just do a credit check before everything else? Before 'me' driving to SD, before paying for a dog sitter, before renting a hotel room. I am absolutely FURIOUS, and HATE how these criminals CHEATED me. In addition to all of this, it was a Honda Financial credit report, not an actual credit report that is used for everything else. If Honda would have used the official credit report, I would have been able to negotiate a lower price than the $282 that I agreed on. Although I extended my lease to a fourth year, Made every single one of my payments + late fees, I'm still treated lie someone who has never walked into your dealership.

PATHETIC!!!

Purchased two cars from Pacific Honda, and have been pleased with the cars and service on both vehicles.  Vince Wolgamott is the service advisor I work with, and, he always explains the needs and is an extremely knowledgeable and polite person.  Needless to say, I am very happy with my 2015 Accord.  Thanks to all!</Review>

<Time>1528246876597</Time><text>After typical experiences over the years and getting the used car salesman treatment  (pressured, offered expensive "extras" you didn't need, long lease/buy paperwork process) it was unexpected and refreshing to not have this happen at Pacific Honda. Jeff, a manager that was in sales but started a new position, still cared enough about customers he met us even though he has a different role. He gave us the straight scoop,  no frills breakdown AFTER asking us what we needed. He thanked my husband for serving in the military  (never acknowledged prior at a dealership before) and he even made us feel at home. He is super knowledgeable about the vehicles and financing options, kind, and respected our needs, going above and beyond any other car buying experience we have had. Thanks Jeff!!!</text>< pictures>

<Text>On the 20th of August, we went into Pacific Honda and met TED COSBY to take the 2016 Odyssey for a test drive. Ted is extremely down-to-earth and easy to talk to, and very knowledgeable regarding options and upgrades.
He was able to negotiate  a deal that met our budget, and gave us the options that we desired.  We really enjoyed working with Ted, and I know when the time comes for another new car, we will be sure to come to Ted.
Once the deal was done, Ted took the time to contact us at home, and he said if there is anyway he could help us, if we have questions, etc. he will be right there for us.  Ted is honest, not high pressure at all, and it was a real pleasure doing business with him. I would highly recommend  to our friends that they come in to see Ted; we know he will treat them right!!<//Text>< userid>

Bought our last five Hondas there! This is or favorite dealership mostly due to the fact that Dario in sales is the best . We followed him from DCH and he always treats us like family. I have referred family and friends and everyone I know has had an excellent experience!< /review>

<gmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909<//gmapID><Text>My wife and I had a great experience here! We leased a really good car for very reasonable price (indeed $209+tax/month) with no down payment (I paid only first month payment + registration and some other fees) as it was advertised at Pacific Honda website.  Our Honda Civic is great and we love it!
I especially want to thank Mark Paydar, who assisted us in choosing the car. He is a very polite and knowledgeable car sales representative. In contrast to many other sellers that I had experienced before, he didn’t push us, but he demonstrated in details all the advantages and features of the car.  By the way, I was surprised how well-equipped Honda Civic is if compare with other cars in the same and even higher price range. And thanks to Mark we made the right decision. He provided us with quite a long test-drive on the surrounding streets and highway, so we both had good opportunity to test the car. Even after deal and paperwork were done (30 minutes after dealership closing), Mark spent a lot of time to provide us with comprehensive explanation of all car features and recommendations how to drive and maintain the car.  His assistance was helpful and valuable.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><Date>1419196377962<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Brandon in service is very professional and will only sell you what you need and looks for ways to save customers money and keep their business for the life of the vehicle.  Great job to everyone in the service department especially the mechanics who are working hard all day but never get to interface directly with the happy customers.  Thank you Team Pacific Honda.

<text>Our experience with Scott Stevens at Pacific Honda was excellent. He got us into the car we wanted and was very helpful throughout the purchase. We were so happy that we ended up going back to him 2 weeks later to purchase a second Honda. He was a pleasure to work with and answered all of our questions with great knowledge. We would definitely recommend him and Pacific Honda<//text>< pics>

<Review>Recently purchased a 2016 Accord EX-L V6. I was very happy with the total experience, from the Sales Manager to Finance Manager to after sales experience, I am very satisfied. My Sales Associate Richard fought a case with me to get the deal that I wanted on my particular car and made the whole process stressfree. Dottie in Finance was amazing, she really worked hard in getting me the best finance deal. If you are in the market for a new or used Honda, I would definitely recommend checking this dealership out.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Although I did not buy my car from Pacific Honda, I wanted to leave a review to help other buyers.

Pacific Honda offered a pretty good "E-price" over email. I will admit it was hard to beat. I waited a few more days and contacted more dealerships and got it for a few hundred less because I was not in a rush.

I think overall Pacific Honda is alittle bit more straightforward. They can offer you OTD prices quick so you know exactly where you stand.

I rated most of the dealerships I shopped at. Look around and be patient to find the best price. Always do your research!</Review>

< review>
I had been thinking about a buying a car for some time, but I tend to procrastinate.  I searched the internet, and decided on a Honda Civic.  I was visiting my son in San Diego, and we decided to just go out to look, and maybe test drive a Civic sedan.  When we got to Honda Pacific, which my son chose because of its excellent reviews, we were greeted by Angelina James.  I told her exactly what I was looking for, down to the color, and she asked us to give her a minute.  Almost immediately, she drove the exact car I mentioned, to where we were standing. I decided to test drive the car. It was everything I wanted, but I still wasn't sure I wanted to buy the car that day. Angelina was very professional, not pushy, and explained everything.  She was very personable, and easy to talk with.  I ultimately decided to buy the car.  After all of the paperwork was completed, Angelina spent a long time helping me to understand the phone, navigation system, and other parts of the car.  She acted like she valued me as a customer, even after the car was signed, sealed and delivered.  She did a follow-up call to see how I liked the car, and to thank me for buying it.  I had a very pleasant experience, which was much shorter that I anticipated - from start to finish. I highly recommend Angelina James, and if I were to give her a grade it would be an A+. I would not hesitate to send a friend to Pacific Honda, and I would recommend that they ask for Angelina James.<//review>

My wife received an offer email for a new lease and we decided to check it out today. We were greeted by immediately when we got out of our car by our salesperson for the day, Robert Kent. Robert took us through the whole process, answered all of our questions, and really made it the best experience I have had at a dealership. I cannot recommend Pacific Honda enough.< /Review>

The manager contact me on yelp claiming they were short staff on Christmas Eve, which they were not. The attendant told me to move my car to the express service lane when the van block my way and 15 minutes later old me that they close at 2 even though it was one o'clock. Fast forward to today, I pulled up and did what the attendant told me the previous time to just pull up to the express service. Out come the express service manager Yamileth Osorio telling me I need to check in first were I originally went on 12/24. I back up to the other lane and the service adviser tells me there is a 2 1/2 hour wait. Outrages!!!!! The first issues I had with this service department is that they don't do appointments for oil change, which to Yamileth response was it will never take more than 1 hour . I asked to speak to the manager which she came out again and said that 12/24 issues was because I didn't get check in properly by the lot attendant and that there was a cut off( which she never mentioned what time) so now that is excuse #2 for the 12/24 issue. They should be ashamed ! Everything is great when you are looking to buy a car and they offer great pricing and service agreement, but when the harsh truth is that they will fail to meet up the end of their bargain. Please be really cautious of buying a car here because the horrible service when it comes to maintaining your car. My advice, go to another Honda not own by the Sunroad Auto company or any dealership own by them because even though their saying is " for all the right reason " it supposed to be " for all the lying reasons" . I am just appalled! I didn't expect my $28000 car to come with bad services and head aches.</Text>

<review>I must say that your dealership, Amal and everyone who helped facilitate the purchase of our new Honda Accord plug in hybrid have been exceptional to deal with.  We were looking for a vehicle for approximately the last 8 months and have been unwilling to move forward because of what is typically not a very pleasant experience. I am very  happy to tell you thank you for the pleasant surprise and smoothness of honoring your word and making this a wonderful experience for us especially since we were negotiating the deal from another state.< /review>< date>

The sales guy I was working with didn't know about the car completely. He mentioned about a couple of features of the car which are actually not present in the car. So I would suggest that you should test run each of the features which they mention to you about the car.
Overall, their customer service is really good!< /review>< pictures>

I recently traded in my old car and purchased my first car (2016 Honda Fit EX) from Gregory Allen at Pacific Honda. I was very impressed with how knowledgeable and friendly Greg was right from the get go. He was very helpful in answering all my questions and provided outstanding service. This was a great experience and I highly recommend if you are visiting Pacific Honda that you ask for Greg!<//Text>

<Review>1st review: accurate reviews, great team.  I wrote that after they performed the recall maintenance on my 2013 Accord. I thought my car was perfect before I took it in, and somehow, they made me love it even more.  2nd review: They just fixed the heater on my 2004 Accord.  The maintenance advisor (Jun Iwasaki) is 6 stars out of 5.  Maybe a 7.  I had an issue with the scheduling department and he handled it well above my expectations, in an absolutely stellar manner.  The dude is a rockstar.   As for the AC/Heater Maintenance.  Do not let anyone tell you that maintenance costs more at the dealership.  The price was extremely reasonable,  (half of what I expected), and well below what I had been quoted at a non-dealership.  More than anything, I TRUST Pacific Honda.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
I bought my car from Pacific Honda and they have a wonderful service center.  I had to go to a different Honda location for a service and oil change when Pacific Honda was closed for a holiday.  I was told by the other dealer that I needed a new battery right away.

I went to Pacific Honda to get it rechecked and was surprised to find that the battery was fine and that I didn't need to buy a new one.

I was assisted by Josh Nguyen.  Very polite, professional, and kept the service center running fast.  When I explained what I needed, he had me pull over to the side of the garage and took care of my issue in  a matter of minutes.

Pacific Honda will always have my business.<//Review>

I always have the best experience when I go to pacific Honda. This is a vey sweet lady that welcome you and assisted with the information that they need to get my work done. While I am waiting I am watching the news and having some coffee. The service is pretty fast. The only thing that I will suggest is to go early because it gets pretty busy, obviously, right the service is perfect.< /Review>

She made me feel like my welfare (and that of my Accord) was uppermost in her mind.  She was courteous without being soppy, and she described the car's issues without making me feel like a moron.

And to top it off, when it came time for me to pay for the service visit, I encountered a very happy, smiling cashier named Kat!</Text>< date>

<Review>Pacific Honda has wonderful customer service. I was a little overwhelmed at the prospect of buying my first car, but I felt as if all of my questions were answered honestly and thoughtfully. I told the staff what I was able to afford and what I wanted, and they worked with me to make it happen! I'm very grateful for my experience there. I shopped around a bit before making my final purchase (2013 Honda Fit :) and I can say without a doubt that these are some of the most genuine car salesmen you will come across!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>We walked in prepared to buy a car, we had done our homework and knew what we wanted and what we wanted to pay. Our sales person, Dan Nichols, was excellent. he explained the options, was very low pressure, andmade the purchase a pleasure. He was extremely helpful and informative, there was minimal haggling and we drove away with a new Honda Fit that day, very satisfied. Dan has followed up with us by email, and been attentive but not overly so. I would rate this as the most pleasant car buying experience I have ever had.
We are also very happy with the car.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Mike Oram helped me and he was very friendly and Informative. I traded in my 2016 Honda Accord LX for the Ex model. He was not pushy at all. He just wanted to help me with my request, he was not like your typical car salesman who try to get you to by things at their benefit. He is very genuine. He made this an easy process. I went to Honda lemon Grove and didn't have greatest service months ago and had to settle for the Lx base model, which I felt pressured.
I'm glad I was able to work with such a friendly dealer at pacfic Honda! Even their accounting staff was friendly, professional and quick.
Thank you to all!!< /Text>

As always, excellent service and no-nonsense advice. I have been taking our 1998 Odyssey since we bought it. Of course, it helps to have a very reliable vehicle, but the quality of maintenance provided is one of the reasons it runs perfectly.< /Text>

Our visit to Pacific Honda began on a very hot September afternoon.  The immediate customer service soon had us whisked into a truck that we were interested in for a test drive.
Afterwards, when that particular vehicle didn't turn out to be exactly what we were looking for, Ricky was ready with another suggestion which turned out to be the perfect fit.
We are very pleased with our service and overall experience at Pacific Honda and would definitely recommend Ricky as he goes above and beyond in helping his customers.<//Review>

It was exceptionally easy to do business with Brooks Simpson and his staff at Pacific Honda. My pre-owned vehicle was a tremendous bargain and everything was no nonsense and straightforward - they really worked overtime to get the figure I needed to make this happen. I would recommend Brooks as your first call when looking for a great deal.</Review>

Took my 2017 Honda Accord in for an oil change. The staff was courteous and quick to complete the work. They offered me the Honda Pak value card for $129.99 which included 50% off the oil change. I know a good value when I see it.  I had purchased this value pak in the past. This is my 2nd Accord and my 3rd discount card from Honda. I am covered for the next 4 years for 10%off services and the added bonus, free car rentals when I need to leave my car for future services. I saved $33.00 today. My next service will be a big one and I will save about $55.00. I have save almost the cost of the discount card with just these 2 visits. Thanks Honda for continuing this valuable offer for your customers.< /text>

I saw a minivan they had online we called , let them know we were on our way, (2h) drive, they called back 20 minutes later to let us know it was selling. Frank was quick to reply so that we wouldn't make the drive if we were set on that van. He expressed they had similar vans around the same price and mileage if we still wanted to make the drive. We did. When we got there Darnell was who helped us, he was kind , friendly and professional. He help  find our minivan was interactive during the dragged out paper work that comes with purchasing a vehicle. Over all they made our first family vehicle buy a great experience !!!  Big Thanks and Gratitude to Pacific Honda , Frank and Darnell .< /Text>

I have been looking to get a New car for while . I did my research and decided I wanted a Honda Civic. I had heard that Pacific Honda was a great place to start ... Well from the moment we got onto the lot we were greeted by Eugene Mendoza, He was very friendly but not pushy at all. We told him what car we wanted and that i wanted Black on black leather seats a 2013. Eugene was amazing, very professional and knowledgeable. He found my dream car on the lot. He explained everything we need to know . I will recommend Eugene to everyone I know.....we were also helped by Fadie.... He was also great!!!!  We came to an agreement on the price and i walked out a very happy customer. Eugene is awesome</text>

I have brought in our Honda Odyssey for oil changes and other minor repairs to the quick service area, and they have always been very efficient and they complete the service within the estimated time that they say they will.  They don't try to oversell parts or services that are unnecessary unlike many other oil and lube places.  I highly recommend them.< /Text>

<review>Angelina is the best! She helped me find the car I've been wanting to get for so long. This was my first time buying a car after graduating college just a year ago. She worked with me and tried to get the best numbers that I felt comfortable putting down, and that was really important to me. She never pushed me, she just constantly asked me questions in order to help me get the best service. She's not only a great salesperson, but is a great friend to talk to as well! I'd recommend her to anyone who goes here to buy a car :]</review>< pics>

I always have the best experience when I go to pacific Honda. This is a vey sweet lady that welcome you and assisted with the information that they need to get my work done. While I am waiting I am watching the news and having some coffee. The service is pretty fast. The only thing that I will suggest is to go early because it gets pretty busy, obviously, right the service is perfect.<//Text>

Loved the buying experience at Pacific Honda with Jojie Delfin.

I explained that I wasn't in a hurry but that I would definitely let him know when I was ready to move forward. Initially I test drove the Accord and loved it but after taking time to really think about what I wanted, the CR-V is what I ended up purchasing.

Jojie made it easy (for me, haha not for him)! He gave me time & space to consider the options but was very responsive when I had questions. I am extremely particular AND I work in sales so the experience with him was awesome. Not pushy, very knowledgeable, very thorough, and helped me find the exact interior/exterior/trim levels and colors that I wanted. I drove a pretty hard bargain but he definitely made it work for me.

The only (small) negative is that I have some unanswered questions for finance that I haven't heard back on but nothing else was bad here.

I would HIGHLY recommend Jojie at Pacific Honda!< /text>

<Review>1st review: accurate reviews, great team.  I wrote that after they performed the recall maintenance on my 2013 Accord. I thought my car was perfect before I took it in, and somehow, they made me love it even more.  2nd review: They just fixed the heater on my 2004 Accord.  The maintenance advisor (Jun Iwasaki) is 6 stars out of 5.  Maybe a 7.  I had an issue with the scheduling department and he handled it well above my expectations, in an absolutely stellar manner.  The dude is a rockstar.   As for the AC/Heater Maintenance.  Do not let anyone tell you that maintenance costs more at the dealership.  The price was extremely reasonable,  (half of what I expected), and well below what I had been quoted at a non-dealership.  More than anything, I TRUST Pacific Honda.</Review>< name>

Guys, do not go over this place. Very bad customer service. Poor deals. Zero customer value. Go to other Honda Dealers. I buy from Mossy Honda. The sale manager is very rude. It feels like he is the only one who knows the business and you know bullshit. Just pathetic. Just bunch of Crap.

DO NOT INSULT YOUR SELF AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE.<//Review>

I came into Pacific Honda just to take a look at a Honda and I had the pleasure to meet Angelina. Angelina greeted my friend and I and was extremely accommodating. She treated us with respect and served us with AMAZING customer service. I would reccommend any of my friends to come in and do business with her. I am so appreciative of meeting her and the car I am driving away is amazing.< /review>

<review>We just purchased our second vehicle at Pacific Honda (a 2015 Honda Pilot).  We purchased a Honda Odyssey from Pacific Hond a couple of years ago.  We had a great experience in both transactions.   The service was excellent, the sales associates were helpful and the process ran smoothly both times.  And in both transactions, the price was great.</review>< gmap_id>

I just bought a gorgeous Civic, and had all the help I needed. Ted Cosby was my sales rep, and he made sure I was satisfied and got the best price (possible). The whole process, from show up, to test drive, offer, approval, signing, and driving off was about 2 hours... not too shabby!

There are plenty of protections options, and the payment plan is a no-brainer. If you can't afford a new vehicle, there are plenty of great used ones.< /review>

Jojie made it easy (for me, haha not for him)! He gave me time & space to consider the options but was very responsive when I had questions. I am extremely particular AND I work in sales so the experience with him was awesome. Not pushy, very knowledgeable, very thorough, and helped me find the exact interior/exterior/trim levels and colors that I wanted. I drove a pretty hard bargain but he definitely made it work for me.

The only (small) negative is that I have some unanswered questions for finance that I haven't heard back on but nothing else was bad here.

I would HIGHLY recommend Jojie at Pacific Honda!</review>< gmap_id>

Took my 2017 Honda Accord in for an oil change. The staff was courteous and quick to complete the work. They offered me the Honda Pak value card for $129.99 which included 50% off the oil change. I know a good value when I see it.  I had purchased this value pak in the past. This is my 2nd Accord and my 3rd discount card from Honda. I am covered for the next 4 years for 10%off services and the added bonus, free car rentals when I need to leave my car for future services. I saved $33.00 today. My next service will be a big one and I will save about $55.00. I have save almost the cost of the discount card with just these 2 visits. Thanks Honda for continuing this valuable offer for your customers.<//Review>

DARIO MORLA rocks!!! NICEST, easiest salesman ever! BE SURE TO TRY PACIFIC HONDA!!!! He greeted us immediately, friendly, helpful, but not overbearing. We said we were just looking.....and he still spent hours with us with no pressure. We did some test drives, looked at three different models extensively, asked tons of questions - all knowledgeably answered, again with no pressure. We were almost going to leave after looking at the Hondas to compare Camry (as that was our original plan), and he was nice about that, too, and said if that made us feel more comfortable.

But in the end, with the Costco discount and good trade in value (and we had an almost 16yr old car), and just how good the experience had been this far, felt trusting, we decided to buy right then and there. Everything felt so right, all staff friendly and professional, felt very cared for. We didn't leave until almost 11pm as they helped set up licenses, clean out our old car, sync phones, explain things inside car - they went above and beyond - and, again, never once felt hurried or pressured.  BE SURE TO CHECKOUT PACIFIC HONDA - AND DARIO!!

- - - - -
The other side of the story.......below is our review of another dealership we left right before coming to Pacific Honds.....and another example of why we feel Dario and Pacific Honda are so great!!

[my posted google review for DCH Honda]....
Walked in TWICE to DCH Honda - - AND NO ONE EVEN SAID HELLO!!!!!! First time spent 5 minutes looking at cars inside. Then left and walked in used lot, then came on again. Receptionist leaning against wall - PLAYING ON A CELL PHONE - looked up and saw us and just ignored us. Other staff seemed busy and didn't care to even acknowledge or ask if we could wait or anything.  Now on our way to Pacific Honda and hope someone there knows what basic customer service is and how to say hello to a customer!!!<//Text>

I just bought a gorgeous Civic, and had all the help I needed. Ted Cosby was my sales rep, and he made sure I was satisfied and got the best price (possible). The whole process, from show up, to test drive, offer, approval, signing, and driving off was about 2 hours... not too shabby!

There are plenty of protections options, and the payment plan is a no-brainer. If you can't afford a new vehicle, there are plenty of great used ones.< /Review>

<Review>Went to the Express Service. I was 3rd in line and they did a good job of managing my expectations by letting me know what the wait time was. The gal at the counter (sorry I didn't catch her name) was very nice and friendly. Checking in and out was so much more pleasant that other Honda dealerships in town. Will continue to come here even though it is out of my way since I live in Chula Vista.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I went pacific Honda over the weekend because my check engine light was on. When I got there, their express service had a 2.5 hr line. Fair enough, they have no control over how busy they get, although they could have set up an appointment process. I went to the regular service counter after that and asked what the code in my car meant, and they said that it was the 60K service and that to do that it would cost me $495, I mentioned that I had done my 30K in Oregon and that I don't seem to recall it having cost that much money. They claimed differences in markets, cost of living, etc.

I called my Oregon Honda dealership, and they said that the 60K service cost was $189. I can understand cost of living differences, but $450 vs $189???? really?? so I then decided to call a few other dealers around California, and another one in San Diego charges $270, so I went back in to talk to the service manager and asked why the difference. His answer "I don't know what to tell you!"

I have always had a great experience with Honda dealerships until I got to this one. I'm not exactly sure how Honda Corporation allows this to happen, but they have lost me as a costumer, and I hope they lose many other customers they are trying to cheat out of their rightfully earned money.<//Review>

<Review>Met with Mark Morrow two weeks ago and drove off with a gorgeous, 2013 Honda Civic. While this was not my initial plan, I am so happy I stopped in and met with him. He is courteous, not the stereotypical "salesman", and genuinely looking to help in the painful process of a car search.

Thanks for making it so easy Mark. You rock!< /Review><GmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909<//GmapID><Name>Susan Davis< /Name>< Time>

Purchased a 2016 Odyssey yesterday and had an excellent car shopping experience with Salesperson Robert Kent.  Arrived at 4 pm and left at 8 pm with a new car.  Robert listened to our request, did not push yet very informative about the Odyssey.  Answered all our questions, cared about our needs and up front with what Pacific Honda could do for us.</text>

A week ago my wonderful father checked the tire pressure in my car. He confused my car with my sisters and thought my tires had too much air in them so he let some air out of each. As i pulled away, the "tire pressure" notification came on. So I pulled over, checked the tire pressure of each with my tire gauge and realized what had happened. I had the irritating tire pressure notification in my car for a week and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make it go away. I read the manual and was just struggling. So I thought "I'll just pop into the Honda store and ask someone to guide me." When I arrived, a guy walked up to me and asked me the problem. He told me there was "no way to change the notification" and that I had to get my car inspected. I understand the liability of Honda's to need to check each of my tires before I leave the service lot (obviously.) But he continued to repeat "I'm sure the real problem is that the tires really don't have the accurate amount of air in them" insinuating that I really don't know how to check my own tires. Mind you, I'm a 25-year-old female and I get the "pity" and "incompetent" look from people like him often. I explained to him that I had checked multiple times and I can guarantee that It isn't the tire pressure that's the issue. He wasn't convinced and even chucked at my confidence.

I did some more research and I was able to google a resolution. Low and behold, the notification went away in just a few moments.

Chauvinism shouldn't be tolerated. This is my first ever review of any sort and it's because I'm sick of women my age "having" to prove themselves as competent whereas competency would have been assumed if I were a man.< /review>

I don't think I have EVER dispensed with a 5-star rating for ANYTHING, but I was inches away from giving the HIGH FIVE to JERREMIE MINTER at Pacific Honda for the way she treated me in early November, when I brought in my 2004 Accord for a 150K-mile service.

She made me feel like my welfare (and that of my Accord) was uppermost in her mind.  She was courteous without being soppy, and she described the car's issues without making me feel like a moron.

And to top it off, when it came time for me to pay for the service visit, I encountered a very happy, smiling cashier named Kat!< /review>

It was diagnosed as being caused by a mixer motor, which had to be ordered.  Unfortunately the part was not readily available and ended up being ordered from four different warehouses before it was obtained.  Follow-up action by both John Newman and Jerremie Minter tracked down the part and notified me it had been received, at which time I returned and had the part installed.

Originally we bought a 100000 mile, 8 year warranty for our new 2008 Civic Hybrid.  Over the years it has been very worthwhile. We had to have all of the Hybrid batteries replaced at about the 5 year mark. We didn't know about the issue recall until the techs told us about it. So at 50000 miles or so we had all new batteries, no charge.  This year we took it in for a regular check up, complaining about a noise.  They told us it would be $3000 to fix it but it was not a safety issue, just some electronic noise. I then realized, a couple of weeks later,  that I had 2 days, yes just 2 days, left on my warranty on the day I had brought it in for service. I mentioned it to my service rep. They hesitated, but then agreed to take care of it. I was ecstatic. These guys at Kearny Mesa Honda, and Honda in general, are great. Go here. Use these guys. You'll be stoked.< /review>

The line to drop the car off is long, especially around 8am.
I had an 8 o'clock appointment, and still had to wait a good 30 minutes to drop the car.</review>

I have never had a salesman be so engaging and honest. I know a lot about the car business growing up as a car dealer’s daughter. When he showed me the options between buying new vs used it was clear what my best move was. After checking with my Dad (of course) even he said “Jojie was right”...the first time he has said that about a car salesman in 40 years!  Ask for Jojie!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><resp>None</resp><review>My daughter and I had a great experience at Pacific Honda, where my daughter purchased her first car (a 2008 Honda CRV). We saw the car on the internet and made an appointment with Tate Mackenzie to show us the car. I had previously had terrible experiences purchasing cars at dealerships, but Tate was so funny and friendly, that he made purchasing a car a pleasure. It was more like purchasing a car from a friend, than from a salesman. He was not pushy at all and did not make us sit there for hours.  Instead, he really worked with us to find a fair price. Tate made the purchasing experience smooth and hassle-free.  My daughter absolutely loves her car and we left the dealership extremely happy and satisfied. Tate also contacted us a few days later to ensure that my daughter was still happy with the car and that we were satisfied with the purchasing experience. This was by far the best dealership experience I have ever had. I highly recommend both Tate Mackenzie and Pacific Honda.</review>< time>

The staff was aggressive. He didn't listen to what I was saying was in my budget and kept trying to talk me into more. He said I wouldn't get what I wanted for what I was willing to pay. He misspelled my name, details matter.  I went somewhere else got exactly what I wanted for 1k under my budget.</Text>

Our last transaction just a few days ago when we bought our new Honda CRV was even more positive than the consistently positive experience we usually expect and get from their sales team. The thing I like about them is  I never feel like they're wasting my time with ridiculous tag-team sales pitching. All our dealings with them have always felt straightforward. And the best part is that they're all so professional. This last car purchase was as minimally stressful as anyone could possibly expect car purchasing to be. Ask for Alex; he's so helpful and he definitely knows his stuff.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909<//Gmap_id>< user>

Had a wonderful car buying experience here; Their reputation precedes them! Sales Professional of the Century Brooks Simpson was not only friendly and courteous, but so damn patient and not pushy at all! I thought I knew everything going in but I was pleasantly surprised with his bearing as he answered my questions and put my doubts to rest. Got a great deal (towards the lower end of the KBB fair market value) and I walked away knowing that everything that could've been done was. Shout out to Dottie in Financing and Ryan in Internet Sales; Really the whole team for being so professional.< /text>

<text>Mike Oram helped me and he was very friendly and Informative. I traded in my 2016 Honda Accord LX for the Ex model. He was not pushy at all. He just wanted to help me with my request, he was not like your typical car salesman who try to get you to by things at their benefit. He is very genuine. He made this an easy process. I went to Honda lemon Grove and didn't have greatest service months ago and had to settle for the Lx base model, which I felt pressured.
I'm glad I was able to work with such a friendly dealer at pacfic Honda! Even their accounting staff was friendly, professional and quick.

I was losing power and called the service department at Pacific Honda (since it was during business hours). The service expert, Brandon Warnke, said that since a light went on in the dash that I needed a new Hybrid battery and to bring it in the next morning. When I arrived he already had the paperwork ready for me and it made it easy not to have to explain again what happened (since the light on the dash had disappeared). He was helpful again when it came to replacing the battery by moving my golf clubs and musical instrument suitcase to the front instead of making me come back in and drive those items home so they could have access to the back seat. I was relieved at that. I was happy with the service I got.< /review>

I showed up at Pacific Honda after going to Mission Valley Honda looking for a Honda Fit. I'd left the first dealership originally because they were not able to give me the price that I was looking for, and instead telling me straightforwardly, they tried to upsell me a bunch of other things. But when I went to Pacific Honda,Ted Cosby (one of the sales guys) helped me answer questions and I received a quote right away; and better yet I was able to negotiate a great price within a reasonable budget.

Overall, it was a great experience, and they offer great customer service that doesn't feel sleazy or like they're taking advantage of you. Being a new car buyer, this was a big deal for me. I'd definitely highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for new or used car.</Text>

<review>Had a wonderful car buying experience here; Their reputation precedes them! Sales Professional of the Century Brooks Simpson was not only friendly and courteous, but so damn patient and not pushy at all! I thought I knew everything going in but I was pleasantly surprised with his bearing as he answered my questions and put my doubts to rest. Got a great deal (towards the lower end of the KBB fair market value) and I walked away knowing that everything that could've been done was. Shout out to Dottie in Financing and Ryan in Internet Sales; Really the whole team for being so professional.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>I've had my CRV serviced at Pacific Honda a few times.  They do good work.  Their oil change is a bit pricier than most($46) but I guess it's because they use a synthetic. I'm not sure I buy into synthetic oil but I like their service.  I also appreciate that they have the Express Service for minor maintenance.  Their team is good about explaining everything they did with the car and what needs to be taken care of now and what should be looked at in the near future.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

This is the second time leasing a car from Pacific Honda and I have to say that their sales department is great!  I was looking for to lease a 2019 Honda Civix and reached out to Pacific Honda to understand their Presidents Day promotion.  I had the pleasure to work with Fabrice Borel again as he helped us with our first lease, a 2019 Honda Odyssey!

Fabrice was very responsive, promising to get back to me with quotes within the hour, which he did.  He took into consideration what I was asking for and came back with a deal that I was very satisfied with!

I went in to Pacific Honda to meet the team and get the car and it was all very easy with no pressure to add additional items.  We inspected the car, signed the paperwork, met the very friendly General Manager Erik Nelson and we were on our way!

I highly recommend Pacific Honda if you are in the southern California area. :)<//text>

<review>I had a great experience with Gus. He didn't pressure me to go over what I wanted to pay a month. They found me a really great car with upgrades in the price range I was looking for. The only bad side was I couldn't get covers for gap and warranty, but I love my car. Thanks Gus and the Pacific Honda team.</review>< Pictures>

< review>
went to fix brake squealing noise and my car was still under warranty.  They blamed the aftermarket pads I put on the rear. I told them the OEM pads also made the noise and that's why I changed the rear pads and the noise might came from the front brakes.  They said they could not hear anything wrong. They suggest rotor resurfacing etc. My car had less than 30K miles on it...  Did a servery and said I was disappointed about the service and they said they would contact me for another service. Never got call back and I had to call them several times... at the end of day, I had to change the front brake pads myself to eliminate the squealing noise... When I tried to take the wheels off, I found the lug nuts were WAY over torqued... I had to use my legs to step on the wrench to break them loose... They must had just used an air impact to fasten the lug nuts directly instead of torque wrench... I will never go back again...<//review>

<text>I was wary about my first car-buying experience in 17 years, but I actually had a fun time of it with Brooks Simpson, while making a deal on my Certified, Pre-Owned 2014 Odyssey EX-L.  My last Odyssey had a cassette  tape deck, and that was about it, so I had days worth of questions on the new, high-tech gadgetry.  Brooks was knowledgeable and patient with me.  I made 3 trips to Pacific Honda before making my final decision (I went nowhere else in the meantime), it just took some time after 17 years to take the plunge.   But again, Brooks was patient as well as helpful in getting me the deal I wanted, and since then with my many follow-up questions even after the deal was done.  I'll be back soon when we're ready to replace my other 16-year old Odyssey.  ( I like Odysseys).

Thanks, Brooks!  5 Stars.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I bought a 2015 Honda Civic from Eduardo Ibarra helped me get financed when no one would. I had filed bankruptcy a year ago. I had a wonderful experience he listened to what I was looking for and at my price range he was so great he did not use cheezy used car sales tactics. I will definitely recommend this place.
Thank you Eduardo for everything you did to help me out.</text>

I had the opportunity of having Mark Randle handle my case.  He was direct and honest about what I could expect and was both timely and informative when there were relevant updates for what my car needed.  I've never had anything less than positive experiences with Pacific Honda and this was another time where though it took a few hours to diagnose and solve the problem, I felt like I was working with the right people.<//Text>

< Review>
I went pacific Honda over the weekend because my check engine light was on. When I got there, their express service had a 2.5 hr line. Fair enough, they have no control over how busy they get, although they could have set up an appointment process. I went to the regular service counter after that and asked what the code in my car meant, and they said that it was the 60K service and that to do that it would cost me $495, I mentioned that I had done my 30K in Oregon and that I don't seem to recall it having cost that much money. They claimed differences in markets, cost of living, etc.

I called my Oregon Honda dealership, and they said that the 60K service cost was $189. I can understand cost of living differences, but $450 vs $189???? really?? so I then decided to call a few other dealers around California, and another one in San Diego charges $270, so I went back in to talk to the service manager and asked why the difference. His answer "I don't know what to tell you!"

I have always had a great experience with Honda dealerships until I got to this one. I'm not exactly sure how Honda Corporation allows this to happen, but they have lost me as a costumer, and I hope they lose many other customers they are trying to cheat out of their rightfully earned money.</Review>

Went to the Express Service. I was 3rd in line and they did a good job of managing my expectations by letting me know what the wait time was. The gal at the counter (sorry I didn't catch her name) was very nice and friendly. Checking in and out was so much more pleasant that other Honda dealerships in town. Will continue to come here even though it is out of my way since I live in Chula Vista.<//Text>

Let me start off by saying I am normally not the type to leave reviews but today I went into Pacific Honda to purchase my first new car. I received amazing service from Max Altair. My sister and I both were looking into buying something but kind of unsure at the same time. Max was great explaining each car that we showed interest in since we are girls and don't know much about it. I was honestly afraid coming in cause I have never purchased something so big before but Max made it feel comfortable. He wasn't pushy at all and was unique about it. You can tell he practice honest business and not just trying to sell us a car. He was doing everything to see us happy and smile. He even ran around the lot looking for a car with the lowest mileage for me. Also received top service from Mark Marrow!!!! He worked with us on the magic number for us and made it realistic and explain the benefits of the add ons. These guys are genuine sales guys and they give you all the time needed. It only took us half a day to decide. Lol I am going to recommend everyone to come here. All my family, friends, co workers and clients will hear about these guys and place!<//text>

Originally I had gone to Mossy Honda dealer ship in Lemon Grove and had the worst experience there purchasing a 2017 Honda accord sport. There were some paper work issues regarding my DACA which I was told left no banks wanting to make a deal with me and that the only bank that would make a deal with me was not a bank I wanted to make a deal, the number were not satisfying, the sales man was very mad that I did not buy the car from them and was told I wasted his time. I was later recommended to go to Eduardo by friend, who I spoke to about my experience at Mossy Honda and she told me about how Eduardo helped her fiance get a car out even though he had no credit score. I went to Eduardo and told him about the experience I had with Honda and how back in 2016 I was able to get a 2016 Nissan Rouge with no banks questioning my DACA. Eduardo was very understand and straight forward with me and explained everything every step that was being taken during the paper work regarding checking credit score, he knew exactly which banks would wanna make a deal with me, interest rates, GAP insurance, etc. What I was very happy with was that I didn't feel pushed into buying a car or like if I was wasting his time.<//Text>< pics>

< review>
I brought my honda civic for three different problems around 7:30 am and had all three done before the end of the day! This shop is definitely efficient and extremely productive. My representative was John and he was so helpful with figuring out the rental car situation as well as resolving charges (since my warranty covered rental cars)

The only thing I can only say negatively about my experience was their decision to recharge my AC without my permission and acknowledgement. I was told of possible charges for the diagnostics, but it was always to my knowledge that mechanics have to have some kind of authorization before doing actual repairs. I didn't have any time to compare prices and explore other vendors who could have done it cheaper.< /review>

This is my second visit to Pacific Honda, and the second time I have been blown away by the outstanding customer service from Mark Morrow. My family and I, infant daughter in tow, were in and out in 2 1/2 hours (I timed it) and we drove of with a brand new 2013 Honda Pilot, gassed, detailed and ready to go.

I will be a member of the Honda family for as long as Mark is available to help us.< /Text>

<Text>I bought out my Honda that was formerly under a lease. Mark Morrow guided me through the whole process and was accommodating throughout.  My buyout was kind of complicated but he made sure to find a way to complete the deal.  He wasn't pushy about looking at upgrading to a newer model. He answered all my questions and went through all the details of the purchase and financing.  I would hope every experience I have at a dealership is like this one.</Text><gmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909< /gmapID><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

<text>From the beginning, I had a very positive experience. Zach Driscoll was very helpful in getting me set up with salesman Alex Orloff. Alex was fantastic, straightforward, kind, and genuinely willing to help. For the first time ever throughout the car buying process, I did not feel like I was being taken advantage of whatsoever. The dealership manager and finance team were also awesome and made the process much less painful than I had anticipated. I was able to trade in a car I was not happy with and walked away with what I felt was a great deal and a car I love. I am genuinely grateful and will be a repeat customer in the future. Thank you Alex and team!<//text><Time>1497458197683<//Time>< name>

Jonathan Nguyen is awesome. Went above and beyond his duties to satisfy our requirements to make a trade to a newer vehicle. Would definitely recommend Pacific Honda to friends and future vehicle purchases. Thank you Jonathan and Pacific Honda.

I bought a 2015 Honda civic from Pacific Honda in June, 2018. This week when I went to the Pacific Honda Service for a reset in tire pressure checking system, a service guy told me that one of my tire is in different brand with the other three tires. That one is from Yokohama, and the other three are from Michelin, which is the original tire model. I was shocked that this could happen on a car bought from a serious dealership, not from a random guy trying to rip me off. The mismatch in tires is definitely causing different handling in tires due to the material, construction and tread design from different tire manufactuers, and therefore leading to long-term issues in car, such as alignment, suspension and transmission problems.

I went to the Pacific Honda to talk about this and asked for a replacement of the mismatched pair of tires, or at least that one Yokohama tire. The manager, Jose Rogrigues, was trying to convince me that the two mismatched tire are exactly the same without even going out to have a look at my car. He offers to cover only half of the price to replace the Yokohama tire, since it is "not a safety-related issue". How come they can define this is not related to safety? The car parts related to tires could fail earlier than they are supposed to be. When I bought the car, I was told all the tires are new, so I didn't ask if the tires are matched. Aren't the tires supposed to be MATCHED on a car? Another manager, Curtis Ringle, performed a "I have asked my boss and this is the best we can do" act. This is really annoying and disappointing. I am writing this down to let people know never go to Pacific Honda for used car shopping. They will only treat you well before you buy a car from them.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I was losing power and called the service department at Pacific Honda (since it was during business hours). The service expert, Brandon Warnke, said that since a light went on in the dash that I needed a new Hybrid battery and to bring it in the next morning. When I arrived he already had the paperwork ready for me and it made it easy not to have to explain again what happened (since the light on the dash had disappeared). He was helpful again when it came to replacing the battery by moving my golf clubs and musical instrument suitcase to the front instead of making me come back in and drive those items home so they could have access to the back seat. I was relieved at that. I was happy with the service I got.</Review>< pics>

It was a very pleasant, fast and very systematic business transaction to this dealer.  Everybody was attentive and very accomodating. special mention to Pierre Gonzales. He did a good job helping make the deal easier. He's so nice and approachable.

He went above and beyond from financing my new 16 Civic coupe, to helping me get rid of my old Integra to a private buyer so I could have a few extra hundred bucks in my pocket!

I went to Pacific Honda for an oil change, as I had a voucher from when I bought the car. I brought the car in without an appointment, and they were able to take me. It was about the same estimate of waiting time (how often it ends up being longer than estimated, but no, they were finished in less than the estimated time), they had coffee and some snacks in the waiting room. It was super easy! Clean facility and friendly staff. Thank you!<//Text>

The short version: After my vehicle was at Pacific Honda for 22 days for a major warranty job, not only did they not finish the job properly but misdiagnosed their own screw up multiple times. Finally, they managed to sprinkle in a bit of terrible customer service, and poor communication on top of it all.

I have tried to resolve this issue in a reasonable manner over the last month with Pacific Honda management with no success, therefore, I am forced to give a 1-star rating for the horrendous experience I've had.

Had a truly excellent experience here! I knew what i wanted and had done as much "homework" as i could, but I was still nervous I would make the wrong choice, get burned, ect. The sales guy named Darnell was absolutely wonderful. He was helpful, funny, not at all pushy and in the end got me a great deal on exactly what I wanted. I will absolutely return here for my next car (which won't be for awhile hopefully ;) and recomend it to anyone looking fir a car.< /text>

Honda of Escondido was pushy and tried multiple times to pressure us into the immediate purchase.  Pacific Honda has sent us lots of emails, but the staff has been very nice.  They have answered our questions, talked with us, and then allowed us to browse their lot without pressure.  Even when they could not match a price from a competitor, they allowed us to make the purchase from a different dealer, but we paid a little more to go with Pacific Honda.< /Text>

I bought a 2015 Honda civic from Pacific Honda in June, 2018. This week when I went to the Pacific Honda Service for a reset in tire pressure checking system, a service guy told me that one of my tire is in different brand with the other three tires. That one is from Yokohama, and the other three are from Michelin, which is the original tire model. I was shocked that this could happen on a car bought from a serious dealership, not from a random guy trying to rip me off. The mismatch in tires is definitely causing different handling in tires due to the material, construction and tread design from different tire manufactuers, and therefore leading to long-term issues in car, such as alignment, suspension and transmission problems.

I went to the Pacific Honda to talk about this and asked for a replacement of the mismatched pair of tires, or at least that one Yokohama tire. The manager, Jose Rogrigues, was trying to convince me that the two mismatched tire are exactly the same without even going out to have a look at my car. He offers to cover only half of the price to replace the Yokohama tire, since it is "not a safety-related issue". How come they can define this is not related to safety? The car parts related to tires could fail earlier than they are supposed to be. When I bought the car, I was told all the tires are new, so I didn't ask if the tires are matched. Aren't the tires supposed to be MATCHED on a car? Another manager, Curtis Ringle, performed a "I have asked my boss and this is the best we can do" act. This is really annoying and disappointing. I am writing this down to let people know never go to Pacific Honda for used car shopping. They will only treat you well before you buy a car from them.<//review>

< Review>
I rarely write any negative reviews; but feel compelled to do so this time. My service advisor Tony at this service department has no basic sense of time. A simple tire change, which he estimated to be a couple of hours work, turned out to be a whole day of waiting. Maybe this is not a big deal, considering they were busy. But he disappeared and didn't even bother to call to let me know the car was ready. I had to ask around for the ticket, so that I can pay and leave.
The cashier is the rudest person I've ever seen, and refused to find the bill and allow me to pay it. Perhaps, this is one of the place where service is based on customers racial and ethnic groups. But it is shocking that it exists in a diverse place like San Diego.< /Review>

<Text>Great experience I had at this dealer ship. My wife and kids are so happy with the 2016 pilot touring.
I am sure all their sales employees are nice there but ask for Dario if you go there. Straight honest family man. Made it happen even that I am a sales man for over 20 years and I can tale a good deal from a bad deal .
Dario if you or the Manager also Dottie at financial like to smoke tobacco and fine cigars, Smokers land in rancho pensquitos  will always take care of you .

< Review>
I have to admit that I get a stomach ache when I usually walk onto a car dealership lot. I love cars.  I used to go with my dad and test drive cars for fun as a kid, but I get uncomfortable with the high-pressure sales the usually comes with walking onto a dealer lot.  Pacific Honda was a completely different, and wonderfully refreshing experience.  I don't do a lot of online reviews, but after reading a previous scathing review, I feel like I need to tell my wonderfully positive experience.  I'm also going to post this on yelp.  This place deserves some kudos and cookies.  I had a pretty good idea what kind of car and model I wanted, the Pilot Touring.  Marcos was informative, friendly, and helpful.  I NEVER felt pressured.  When it came time to talk about price, he and Paul (the sales manager) were open and fair.  Paul was clear about what he had available, what discounts he could give (and couldn't) and what he was willing to do. I'd done my research, so I knew what I could afford and what was a fair price.  I hate haggling, back-n-forth negotiation stuff.  I want to treat people with respect and fairness and I want to be treated the same.   We agreed on a fair price, a great price.  I don't make purchases like this without talking it over with my wife (duh!).  They never flinched when I told them I would talk about it that night and call them in the morning. I'd been to 3 other dealerships (Toyota and Honda) and ALWAYS got pressured to make a purchase that day.  Paul encouraged me to make the best decision for me and my family.  When I went back the next day, Paul and Tony were great. (Marcos was out, but he connected us with Tony who answered every question.)  It was the Dec 31st, so Paul was slammed with everybody else trying to get a purchase done before the end of the year stuff, but he STILL made the effort to come talk to us 3-4 times and check in.  I know they are trying to sell cars, but he could have sat in his office. Instead, he took a moment to make sure that we were happy.  My parents purchased a CRV from Pacific Honda, and we got the Pilot we wanted for a price I would have had to fight to get at another dealership. I walked out feeling positive, happy, and relaxed (not pressured and defensive like other dealerships).  I would HIGHLY recommend you go and talk to them if you are in the market for a new car.< /Review>

My experience with Pacific Honda was beyond my expectations.  From advice from the general manager on buying a new it used car based on my financial experience to Jose and Darnell at the used vehicular sales lot and found exactly what I wanted,  a black manual transmission HRV to replace my black manual 2006 CRV.   THAT should have been almost impossible, but they did with an extensive inventory on the lot the same day Of my first visit.  First rate, top shelf, 5 star!< /Text>

<Review>For Christmas, I decided to buy myself a car.  The manager and my sales person were great.  They worked with me and I got the deal and the price I wanted.  They even beat my bank when it came to the interest rate.  I hate buying cars and I had been looking for about two straight weeks.  I was tired of car sales people but these guys made my experience great.  They even took me rental car back to the rental company.  It was a pleasure doing business with you.< /Review>< pictures>

I was very happy with the knowledge and expertise shown by Mohamed the sales rep when I bought my 2016 Honda Accord. I liked that he gave me "space" to think about everything and did not "push" me to make a fast sale.
Thank you

{'time': 1485984991433, 'text': 'Petraxz, we are a bit confused by your review as it appeared that your friend was very happy with his purchase when he took delivery of the car on January 28th. When you say “worst experience I have ever had,” was there a particular issue relevant to you specifically that you are referring to? We would be glad to review the transaction with the buyer if he has any questions regarding the selling price and the tax, license and fees associated. –Mary Adams, madams@pacifichonda.com'}<//Response>
<Name>PETRAXZ< /Name><Text>Worst experience I have ever had. My friend went in with a budget of 15,000. He kept telling Lawerence and Lawerence kept saying okay. He said he "understood" us. That he would work with us. We first went over 1000 over the budget. Fine.

Then he signed the papers and was thinking he was going to leave with only a thousand over his budget. We got to the last process and the whole thing came to be close to 20,000.

I do not recommend this dealership to anyone. They are very predator like and do not care about your budget. In fact the last process was going to be put him 5000 dollars over his budget.

Don't even step one foot in this place.<//Text>< Pics>

Terrible Honda dealership. Scheduled an appointment online only to arrive at my scheduled time to find out they do not accept online appointments. Having a confirmation email didn’t matter, the service person, who was actually very friendly, said they try to contact people to inform them there appointment is not valid. I received no call, email, or text.  If they can see these online scheduled appointments to inform they are not valid why can’t Pacific Honda accept them. As someone who’s in the market for a new vehicle I will not be purchasing from here or any other Honda dealer.< /review>

Weird People just be careful and do a walk around with the advisor before leaving your car there because they don't want to take responsibility of anything. I will not be going there anymore going to a different Honda dealership to get my car service but I will be buying other car from them just not going to there service dept anymore.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909< /Gmap_id><Rate>4< /Rate>< date>

Eduardo Ibarra is the person you wanna go to if you want to get the deal done. My wife just got a car from him 1 month ago and I returned a month later to get one for myself. It was a pleasure once again. Thank You Pacific Honda for a great buying experience.<//Review>

Great experience I had at this dealer ship. My wife and kids are so happy with the 2016 pilot touring.
I am sure all their sales employees are nice there but ask for Dario if you go there. Straight honest family man. Made it happen even that I am a sales man for over 20 years and I can tale a good deal from a bad deal .
Dario if you or the Manager also Dottie at financial like to smoke tobacco and fine cigars, Smokers land in rancho pensquitos  will always take care of you .
Thanks again.</review>

<name>Joseph Wilson</name><text>Went in, test drove it, and gave them my info to get it. Took them three days and 11 inquiries on my credit to get me approved, I have a car already so it took a little longer. But as soon as I get approved, and I mean the minute I got approved, they call me and tell me that somebody just got back from a test drive and wanted it. So they sold it to them. I don't know about you, but that's messed up if somebody is already trying to get it, AND GETS APPROVED for it, and they go and sell it to somebody else right off the bat. So all that time and those inquiries for nothing. All to hear that they sold it to somebody else as soon as I got approved. So if you are looking for a car, you better get it right away. Even if you are approved, they'll still sell it from under you.< /text>< user>

Smooth Negotiations. Like many people I hate the idea of negotiating when trying to buy a new car. There are so many stories of bad sales people or dealerships. THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE. Pacific Honda, and particularly Fabrice Borel & JR Kaminski were delightful to deal with. They were honest, factual, polite, knowledgeable, and courteous. What more do you need. And they also followed up the day after asking me if I am enjoying my new car and if there was anything else they could do. Amazing service from a great team. And let's also mention that they have great products to sell. Go Pacific Honda. YOU ROCK!<//Text>

I bought out my Honda that was formerly under a lease. Mark Morrow guided me through the whole process and was accommodating throughout.  My buyout was kind of complicated but he made sure to find a way to complete the deal.  He wasn't pushy about looking at upgrading to a newer model. He answered all my questions and went through all the details of the purchase and financing.  I would hope every experience I have at a dealership is like this one.< /text>

Honda of Escondido was pushy and tried multiple times to pressure us into the immediate purchase.  Pacific Honda has sent us lots of emails, but the staff has been very nice.  They have answered our questions, talked with us, and then allowed us to browse their lot without pressure.  Even when they could not match a price from a competitor, they allowed us to make the purchase from a different dealer, but we paid a little more to go with Pacific Honda.</text>

Spoke with them over the phone briefly explained what we wanted and filled out the paperwork and emailed it in.  We walked in the morning they had the car ready and paperwork signed and walked out in under 30 minutes.  Walley was extremely helpful.  The experience was convenient and easy and wife loves the new car.  The worst part about new cars is being at the dealership for hours to drive your car off.  This was one of the shortest length of times I have been at a dealership to leave with a new car.  If you are looking for easy upfront sales process you should check them out.< /text>< pictures>

< review>
I recently purchased a 2013 Honda Accord EX-L V6 Coupe from Pacific Honda.  The sales rep I had was Daniel Nichols. Mr. Nichols was extremely helpful and worked with me to negotiate a fair price.  With this being my first NEW car purchase, Mr. Nichols was fair in his negotiation.  I had dealings with several other dealers from the Riverside area dealerships (Spreen in particular, had a low price but added "accessories" that inflated the price dramatically). I found Pacific Honda group to be particularly helpful.  Thanks!< /review>

<review>I have always taken my car into Pacific Honda and had really good experiences. However, my last experience was really frustrating. I was quoted a price for the service and then quoted another price for a problem they found. When I went to pay for the 2 services, they had added a significant amount of additional fees with no explanation. My sales rep was out for the day and therefore no one had an answer as to why they had raised the cost so significantly. After waiting 45 minutes, they finally grabbed the manager, who was able to take off the extra fees. Overall, it worked out (despite making me late for work)--- but make sure you look over your billing statement before you pay, to make sure they did not over charge you!!!!<//review>< username>

<name>Samantha Sawyer<//name><Resp>None< /Resp><text>I went into Pacific Honda not intending to buy a car that day, but after looking at the Accords in their lot, I found there was one that had everything I was looking for. I was originally going to go with a Kia Optima from a different dealership that I had already been to, I just wanted to compare prices before I made a decision. Our salesman, Mark, was very helpful and the numbers he showed us were already thousands of dollars less than was I was given at Kia. While I still wasn't satisfied, I told them what I wanted to pay, and they were able to make it happen. Robby was very nice and he made signing the deal very easy and comfortable for us. My boyfriend and I are very happy with our new Accord and we will definitely be back in a few years when were ready for a new lease.</text>< user>

<text>I went to Pacific Honda last year and they hooked me up with what I thought was an unbelievable deal especially with where my credit was so I ended up with a beautiful 2012 Honda Accord 1 year later I went in to upgrade after putting a lot of hard work into my credit. It still wasn’t great but it was good. I was working with Dj for a few days and he spent so much time on my deal to make sure it was the right one he gave me yet another unbelievable deal I was able to get financed through a credit union with a great APR and I was able to get a new 2015 Acura TLX within my budget for monthly payments. Go to pacific Honda you won’t be disappointed once you find that person ,that wants to put you in a car for YOU and not just to sell a car,  you will be loyal for life. I won’t go anywhere else but pacific Honda<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909< /GmapID></record>

I would have rating it for 5 stars because four months ago that I was there at Pacific Honda buying some small parts at their part service department and walked by to service department for appointment for Honda's safety recalls.  Service advisor told me to leave my phone numbers and someone who in charges in safety recalls will call me for appointment reservation, but no one cares about to return calls as customer service when customer needs helps and assistance.  Finally four months later, I got my Honda's safety recalls fixed yesterday.  I am sure most of us as customers have had bad experiences with Pacific Honda's customer services.  I hope their managements needed to pay attention and improve their problems.< /Text>

<Review>Ask for Robert Kent!
I am a first time car buyer with very little to no credit history. I was very nervous about the experience as a whole but Robert made the process really enjoyable.
I came in and Robert showed me the cars that were in my price range and once we found one that I liked he took us on a test drive and he went over all the features in the car. Then worked with me to get the best deal even with my credit situation I'm able to make payments that are good for me. He also made sure my car was spotless before I took it. Now Im the proud owner of an awesome Honda Accord with super clean carfax thanks to Robert Kent!< /Review><userid>114335823510666678211</userid></record>

I had a great experience purchasing my new 2016 Accord EX on 7/2. First, Kathleen at internet dept answered all my initial questions promptly on line. She also left a message if I want to call back. She is friendly &  professional.

My salesman Mike Peters was a pleasure to work with. He was patient with my questions and made the process went fast and smooth. He helped pull out the car I want from the lot while had someone inspect my 2014 Accord for trade in value. I never felt pressured and was eventually given a fair price, high value for my trade in, and excellent financing. Mike is honest, knowledgeable, and professional. He came through with every promise. I hope he is there in 2 years when I come in again for a new Civic. My son is going to college that year.

I also had a pleasant experience with Samantha Jett at the finance department. She made me feel very comfortable and we had some good laughs. She had all the paperwork finished fast and read over everything with me. Made sure I was happy and understand all the papers I was signing.

I highly recommend Pacific Honda to anyone looking to buy or lease a new vehicle. Their customer service is top notch.</Review>

<Review>Came to Pacific Honda to buy a brand new car for my mom and was greeted as soon as we pulled up by Jon our salesman. He instantly put us at ease and we did not feel pressured at all to buy a car. Jon was very straightforward, helpful, and came of fas sincere in trying to help my mom find a car that she really liked. After a couple of test drives, my mom settled on a 2012 brownish/grey Honda Civic. The easy part was finding the car, now the real fun begins.

Being in auto finance has given me an inside perspective on buying a car. Never settle for the MSRP price on a new car and if you aren't at some point getting up out of your seat to walk out of the dealership then you haven't negotiated hard enough.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised with how things worked out. Jon gave me the invoice price of the vehicle and even worked out a deal for us on the alarm. Although the interest rate was unappealing at first, Jon was able to work with the finance manager to get the rate adjusted and an even further price discount on the car! Amazing! I didn't think it was possible for me to feel so at ease, but Jon made every effort to make this transaction pleasant!

My mom is happy with her new car, the financing, and the way we were treated by Jon at this dealership. As long as Pacific Honda has Jon as a salesman, we will back again for the 2013 Honda Accord when I am ready to buy!

Thank you Jon and Pacific Honda!< /Review></record>

I have shopped for cars throughout the years and this one by far was the fastest and most pleasant one AND one of the best deals that I have ever got.
I bought a CRV from Zack and Dario. I called them first, they gave me a very good price and provided me written quote by email (most dealers don't do that and only give you vague and fake promises over the phone - been there, done that). I was so impressed with their honesty and transparency that went to see them same evening. Both Zack and Dario where very professional and completed everything in 1 hours and I left the dealership with a new car and a price tag that almost nobody could even get close!!!
My recommendation is to do your homework, find the best deal on the internet/from other dealers and have your final stop there.</Text>

<username>DAMKY LLC<//username><Time>1453573901124</Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Scheduled an appointment to work on my car, let them know when booking exactly what check engine code it was throwing. Drove all the way from San Marcos early for the appointment and they said they would need me to rent a car for 3 days to diagnose because they probably couldn't get to it on the day they set the time for (sat at 10 am) and wouldn't get to it until Monday afternoon. They never called ahead to let me know not to come. I asked if they'd come the rental, they said that they don't do that. So we wasted gas on 2 cars (the one we were dropping off and the one to pick up so I wouldn't be stuck there), time, and the extreme frustration of dealing with a dealership that just simply doesn't care about their customers. To make matters worse we bought a different car from them about 2 weeks ago. We will never again give our business to a place that simply doesn't care about customers</Text>< pics>

I bought my Honda Accord 2013 coupe full loaded from Angelina  James of Pacific Honda. I am very satisfied with the level of service I got . This is actually my second purchase form Pacific Honda. I would like to say that my experience is very extra ordinary. I have bought cars before from other dealer ie. DCH Honda my 2009 Accord and 2011 Pilot. But i chose not to go back them because their present sales team are all after just sales and does not care about their customer. I would always by my Honda  from Angelina ... I hope she does not transfer to a Toyota dealer, because I would be forced to buy one.</Review>

<Time>1342049348614</Time><review>I came into the Pacific Honda dealership today looking for a great deal and its exactly what I received.  James Morrison, one of the sales consultants was so helpful and completely hooked me up with such a great price on my new honda vehicle. He was so helpful and knowledgeable and made the experience a great one. Best part was, he was willing to work with my budget and what I was looking for. I highly recomend James Morrison from Pacific Honda!< /review>< rating>

<Review>Just bought my first car there. I did most of the leg work over the phone and called 3 different dealerships Pasific Honda really worked with me on the price to wear I was really happy. So much so that I had one shady dealership try and say that the price wasn't going to be true but when I went in everything was just as Pasific Honda said so I'm very happy I picked them. Andy took great care of me with the price and really make me feel like I would be welcome to call or come in if I needed anything.< /Review>< rating>

<text>I have bought 4 new vehicles from Pacific Honda. I only had one issue back in 2010, finance would not return my call until I talked to Gerri. Now 2013 My wife bought a 2013 CR-v two weeks ago and I bought one a few days ago. Marcos worked my wife deal. Mark Morrow handle my deal. Both did a awesome job. Mark had me in and out very quickly. Jaime Jimenez gave me a great deal in finance (it pays to be a returning customer) Well 4 cars in 6 years!! Anyways I highly recommed Pacific Honda.

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>First off I don't want to even give this 1 star, but cannot post it without. I cannot express strongly enough to anyone needing work done on their car to avoid this shop at all costs.
Here is my experience:
I brought my car in on July 28, 2016 due to my brakes needing service and replacement.  They replaced the pads and resurfaced the rotor (front) - total cost $700.00.  On July 8th, 2017 I had my brakes grinding again so I brought the car back to them with the understanding they would have some kind of a guarantee or at least honor their work (less than a year) but instead I was given a quote of $740.00 for a full replacement of pads and rotor, for the fronts only. After talking to several mechanics and shops who all agree that less than a year on brake pads is not normal - but the mechanic at Pacific Honda stated it was totally within the norm (and was extremely rude).  I told them no I would go elsewhere and to put my car back together.  After 2 Lyft rides due to my car being in the shop and needing to go to work ($18.00 and $16.00) I received a text at 8:30pm saying I could pick up my car.
I was working so I went in the next morning (another Lyft $11.00) and was told it would be $65.00 charge for them to just look to find the problem.   I paid it and took my car to another shop and was told that not only is less than a year on new brakes not acceptable, Pacific Honda when they did my brakes last time did not re-engage the back brakes so that is what caused the fronts to fail and now I needed to replace the backs as well. And for a year I was driving without complete brake function! - Total cost with the new shop $670.00 and they gave me a 3 year guarantee.  A basic brake job has now cost me $1,415.00.  So far I have not received a call back from the Manager and only received a call from the front office stating they would be in touch..... we will see. But at all costs in my opinion, AVOID - AVOID.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909</Gmap_id>< username>

Ben is the best and I'm LOVING my 2016 Honda Civic! Ben was fantastic throughout the entire process. I had a list of what I wanted (and didn't want) in a car and he meticulously went through every point to ensure that all of my needs were met. We went for a test drive and I learned everything there was to know about the car in a matter of miles. He left no stone unturned. Gave me a fantastic price, too! Walk in and ask for Ben - he will take care of you from the beginning to the end and then some - he's even followed up with me since to see if I have any questions! Oh, and if you're an iphone user...Apple CarPlay is SO COOL. As soon as I get in my car and plug in, my car asks me if I want to go where I need to go based on the address in the event in my calendar. SUCH A SMART CAR!! It's VERY intuitive, from the volume control to the climate control to the touch screen. Plus, the voice activation thing ACTUALLY WORKS. When I say, "call mom" ...it actually calls my mother (not..."do you mean Brad? Which Brad?") Anyway, highly recommend Ben at Pacific Honda. He knows his stuff!</Review>

Eduardo Ibarra is amazing! I call him the miracle man! Honestly didn't think I'd be eligible to purchase a car as all the other dealerships didn't really want anything to do with me when I told them my situation. I had purchased a Honda civic from pacific Honda in 2000 and it was not a great experience. But thought what could it hurt to try them again since every other dealership basically treats me like I must be joking. The car I purchased from an east coast dealership in 2005 has been having a lot of issues and finally had the engine go bad so I needed a new car badly. I just spent several years in Leukemia treatment and just getting back on my feet dont have the best credit and my only employment is as a Lyft driver. I honestly didn't think i stood a chance. I am so grateful I was helped by Eduardo! Not only was he able to help me but he got me into a 2015 civic with all the trimmings at a significantly lower APR and monthly payment than I possibly imagined! Part of what I really appreciated was that I didn't have to hunt him down and hound him to return calls or any of the nonsense I had dealt with at other dealerships. He was on top of things and kept me constantly informed about what he was doing and how things were going and came up with a few options for me to choose from. He had the carfax report ready for me and the price was actually a bit better than what I had expected. The whole process was so much more trouble free than I had anticipated. Thank You so much Eduardo!</Text>

<text>Not even one star.  So I recently bought my car to this service department because my sensor for the breaking and the collision for the left and right bumper wasn't working properly (which caused some damage to my vehicle), first I dropped it off at the appointment time and needless to say the they were late excepting my car.  Then I sat and waited for the shuttle service to get back to my husbands vehicle because I had a medical appointment to attend, which they made me late for.  Then a phone call to them, since they've had my vehicle all day with no phone call of a status update, then when I finally received a call back it was to tell me that they were unable to reproduce the issue and they needed to keep it over night to see if they can drive it around to see if the problem will occur again, of course the next day after noon I receive a call say that they drove it around but was still unable to reproduce the issue and to take video of the problem for them (I guess I am supposed to also drive at the same time) and that there is nothing more they can do.  My gas tank was extremely low, so I am unsure of the policy of refilling the tank and now not only does the system malfunction when it is hot outside, but the doors don't work, my dvd player malfunctions and now reading an error about the gas cap.  I can say without any regrets that, I would never go to this dealer for anything Thank you for dragging the Honda name through the mud.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>Mr. J. Gibbard made my recent visit to Pacific Honda a very pleasant one. I've been here in the past and had decent experiences, but this experience was exceptional, due to Mr. Gibbard's prompt, considerate, and "above and beyond" customer service.

I bought my first new car at Pacific Honda.I dealt with Mark Morrow and it was by far the best transaction Ive ever done. I came across the country from connecticut and when I arrived the car was ready. Mark and I went through the entire process via email and phone it was awsome. He took care of my with the pricing and other incentives. Id recommend Mark Morrow and Pacific Honda to anyone looking for a new car. You wont find a more honest and helpful salesman. I love my 2013 civic the car all around is perfect!< /Text>

<name>Karina Chavez<//name><Review>I recently purchased a car there to be exact last november, by the way I totally didn't want to go through the headache of payments and paperwork person. but I needed a car and so as against the whole thing as I was I went for it hoping for the best. It took a whole day to get approved. once it was finally suppose to be ok, one thing after another keep getting calls, measures about getting approved officially, than since the finance department for it finally approved my headache continued on payment. receiving calls , messeges about payment witch i did, and continue to do yet in a month they wanted 3 payments. something I could not do. the whole thing as of now making me hate the decision about every getting into this to begin with... totally dissapointed...< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><user>116256987512428141770<//user><Date>1517715354933< /Date>< Resp>

The sales consult was not friendly and had me drive a the basic model for the Honda Civic although I was interested in the EX model. As a result, I ended up at Honda in El Cajon where I received excellent service and sale price!< /review>

Their service are hit or miss.  It's the closest Honda dealer to me so I am basically forced to use them.  I'm guessing that's why they are so busy all the time.  Overall the service people are friendly and attentive.  I came in with appointment for a recall and was told it would take less than an hour - that was at 8h30AM.  So I stuck around to wait and got a haircut nearby, came back, had coffee, did you emails for work, etc...two hours later I was still waiting.  After some checking, they told me it would get done within the day but didn't know when - so they gave me a rental.  Got a call around 6h30  the same day saying the car was ready.<//Text>

This is one of the best dealerships I have ever been to with regards to customer service. Aimal, Uegene, Mark and everyone else I dealt with were all very helpful and honest. They made what should have been a much more difficult process very smooth and mostly painless. It made trading in my car of 13 years a little less unbearable, especially when driving away in a brand new one. If you are in the market for a Honda in San Diego, I wouldn't go anywhere else. These guys will treat you fairly and not waste your time. Hopefully the new vehicle I bought will last me as long as the last one (over 220,000 miles).</Text>

Don't buy your car here. They sold me a vehicle that I drove one week before it needed serious repairs.  When the vehicle was "repaired" it was not fixed which left me stranded in the desert.  Buy elsewhere. 9 months later I got my money back.< /review>

<review>First off, let me say that I'm a owner of a Honda purchased from this establishment, and is my brother and dad. With that being said, I strongly urge any potential customers to avoid this particular dealership if in the market for a vehicle. The reason why? This dealership lacks honesty and integrity; they do not put the customer first. My dad specifically asked then to request a blue Type R, and Frank explicitly guaranteed him that he is "first in line" for the vehicle. Well, Pacific Honda did receive the blue Type R, but now, told my father that it was already "allocated." And now funny thing is, Frank refuses to speak with my father, directing the call other associates. I've been a diehard Honda enthusiast since I could remember, and will still continue to support Honda in the future, but my families business with Pacific Honda will not continue, and I can no longer, in good conscious, recommend this dealership to anyone, in the future. Sorry.< /review><rating>1<//rating>< name>

Sale consultant, Shuai Wang, appeared to be inexperienced, did not listen to a customer and basically said me and my aunt were too fat to fit into a Honda CRV. He made the experience terrible; he said he knows what the customer needs rather then what the customer wants; he tried to sell us a civic for 200 a month and then later said he could provide the Civic as a lease for 200 a month... I called to make a complaint against him and it appears that this might not be his first encounter providing poor customer service. He was rude, inappropriate, pushy, had poor listening skills and lacked experience. He even said his manager said he had poor listening skills.</review>

< Review>
I went to Pacific Honda this morning for an oil change and to check the rotors.  While resurfacing the rotors they "found a nail in one of my tires" and told me it would be $158 for them to replace the tire because it was in a place that could not be patched.  I have no complaints about the service advisor who was friendly enough.  I ended up bringing my car to Costco tire center who told me the nail was NOT located in a place that could not be patched and they would take care of it at no cost.  Also, it turned out the nail hadn't even punctured the tire and nothing needed to be done after all.  I initially went to this honda because of the good rating, however I will NEVER be returning here.  Not worth it for an almost 4 hour wait for what was supposed to be 2-3, an overpriced oil change, and a service center trying to get me to pay for an unnecessary new tire and a $495 30k service package.  $495 for them to inspect my car and replace some fluids that don't even need replacing yet?  Ridiculous.</Review>

The next day we picked up the vehicle and Jojie came into work 2 hours early to make sure he greeted us and that the vehicle was ready. Every one here was greet and very helpful.

Bobby and Eduardo helped from the beginning to the end.
Update since purchase. The vehicle was turned over to me with a terrible detail, (dirt and mud under the pedals) trash in the center console, (nasal sprays and medicines), vehicle needed alignment (they refused to fix and directed me to GMC) and they didn't even give me a full tank. They were fully aware of my situation in which mu father was under going brain surgery and they had proof!! You would think everything would have been done. There were no negotiations, I received no incentive, the vehicle was advertised with gps and it doesn't come with it (must purchase onstar). Terrible experience. Typical used car dealer. I will be more than happy to speak to who ever runs that facility because money isn't free and I feel like I was robbed .<//Text>

<review>What ever happened to customer service? Let me make sure when you read this review you will understand why I'm frustrated and disappointed. The whole experience could have been fantastic review. Here's why...
My Partner and I bought a 2012 Honda Civic LX brand new. Upon getting financed we already knew our finance rate was going to be higher than previously purchased Honda's from the same dealership because of some financial setbacks from 2 years prior. He had to get a car for work reasons and we didn't want some other used car with problems from a previous owner. So the sales person gave us a 17% interest rate which was not negotiable. Again it is what it is. It didn't matter we had bought 2 other brand new Honda's from Pacific Honda. They put my name as the buyer his name as the co-maker. We caught that and that was supposed to have been changed. We got every excuse from it was the bank who did that to they lost the paperwork and so on. Finally after 8 months it appears the names are corrected. He is the legal owner and I the co-signer. Now normally a co-signer does not get monthly bills unless there is a problem with the owner. Up until the last 4-6 months I have received a monthly bill and he sometimes never got one.
He has been paying 17% interest and still is and the dealership has gotten a kick back from Chase Bank for bringing us the customer to them. The amount that gets applied to the principle each month ranges from $175-$200. Our car payment is $423.00 per month. The bank and the dealership are getting more than $225 per month in interest. Now we've all heard of being ripped off but this is what I call getting the screws put to you with a smile. Any reputable business that is truly into customer service and would like a customer to be happy wouldn't do this. We knew the interest was going to be higher before going the Honda dealership but not that high. Pacific Honda is not a buy here pay here tiny dealership or car lot, they are one of the biggest Honda dealerships on the West Coast part of another parent company even larger.
So I would be very careful about buying your next car from this dealership. There has been many times we had little to eat because of struggling to pay them and all the other bills that you have in life.
The service department never answers their phone it's all voicemail. You sit on hold and then get transferred to reservations just to book service. The service advisors will not call you back and more than not the items needed fixed on the car are never done the same day because they need more time. Now remember he dropped his car off at 8-9am they have it all day, he gets a rental pays for the rental and then at 6pm comes back thinking the repairs are going to be done and they aren't. They tell you when you leave the car that they will have everything repaired when you leave it, then it's we got too busy and we had other cars that got done before yours. Why have a reservation and be told one thing then take in more cars than they can fix so that we have to come back pay for a rental car again. At least 1 time the car still had to come back a 3rd time. We have owned 4 Honda's, 2 BMW's, 2 Toyota's  and have never been treated as rude as Pacific Honda's service dept. does to it's customers. I've watched more customers than I can count on 1 hand be so frustrated they were screaming at the cashier or service advisors when picking up their cars. The response from the Honda reps., is like "Oh well" next customer... We urge you to think about where your hard earned cash is going to go and spend it with another dealership that earns your business. We've all heard this "they got your money now and your screwed" don't let that be you.< /review><rating>2<//rating><date>1430244819246</date>< response>

<Text>I had an exceptional car buying experience here. After long research my family chose to go with a civic for my daughter. We went to three dealerships in San Diego and were treated poorly in the first two. We then decided to go Pacific Honda. We had the pleasure of working with Aimal Abawi. He was patient, knowledgable, and very helpful. The finance manger was nice as well. Nice overall atmosphere.</Text></record></dataset><record>

On January 31 we purchased a new 2018 Honda Civic EX from Pacific Honda. And we have Yvon Serov to thank for that. We were searching for a “new" car for my daughter who was looking to replace her 2003 Honda Civic. Initially my daughter planned to purchase a previously owned vehicle because that would fit better into her current financial situation. In addition to Honda Civics and Accords, we also researched Toyota Corollas and Camrys, Mazda 3s, Hyundai Elantras, Subaru Imprezas, Chevy Cruzes, plus Ford Focuses and Fusions.  After all that research, we determined that a Honda Civic was the best in class for the vehicles that my daughter was interested in and could best afford. Thus, we first met Yvon because of my daughter's interest in a 2016 Honda Civic EX that Pacific Honda was offering for sale.

My daughter was able to successfully communicate with Yvon independently of myself and I believe that when Yvon learned that my daughter was also researching new 2018 Honda Civics, he and she began discussing what Pacific Honda could do to compete with other Honda dealerships' best offers. Truthfully I felt somewhat of an obligation with the staff who had been very kind and patient with us taking time and negotiating the best deal to date. So if the offers had been comparable, I would have felt that the other dealership deserved our business. However, when Yvon informed us that Pacific Honda was able to offer an even better price by a few hundred dollars, we were happy to listen.

Again, I was very impressed by the care and respect that Yvon showed my daughter in discussing (via text and phone calls) both previously owned and new Hondas. When the three of us met together, my daughter and I found Yvon to be honest with us and not try to up sell us. He realized that our decision on purchasing a 2018 Honda Civic EX would be fully determined by the best offer. And Yvon made us an offer we could not refuse.

It did not hurt that our family has a long history with Pacific Honda having purchased four vehicles from Pacific Honda over the past two decades—my 2000 Odyssey which I am still driving happily, my daughter’s previously mentioned 2003 Honda Civic, plus the 2006 Honda Accord that one of my sons drives and the 2018 Civic that my other son drives. Plus I have appreciated the fine quality service received from Shawn Dvergsten who has managed the servicing of my Odyssey for many years.

After the purchase, Yvon took his time in explaining the navigation and other parts of the 2018 Civic to my daughter after he had her car cleaned and washed. Yvon was wonderful to work with and I will definitely recommend him to any friends who let me know that they are in the market for a “new” car. Thank you for having such good staff (both in sales and service) who care about and appreciate your customers.<//Review>

I just purchased a Honda Civic EX this past Sunday, very happy with the service I received from Tarig and most of all I got the deal through email, I didn't have to be in person to go over the payments a hassle free, got their around 5:00pm and left at 6:30pm, sweet, happy customer.  I still need to pay a visit to the El Centro, CA Honday manager to tell him that he could a lot better than his weak offer he gave me.  Pacific Honda beat their offer by a large margin.  My next car Pacific Honda will be my first and only option.< /Review>

He did attempt as much as he could to get me the Si as they did not have any in stock. He went through several phone calls and several managers but there were no Si sedans available. After carefully deciding, I chose to go with the 2012 Civic Ex Sedan. It was an excellent choice and great on gas mileage. Zaid was an enormous amount of help throughout the three hours I had spent there. If you plan on purchasing a new car from there, definitely ask for him! He made things easy as was very fast with what I had asked for. Thanks again. Overall, I had a fun great time and was happy with my purchase. When the 2013 Civic Si Sedans come out, I'll definitely come back to take a look.</text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pictures>

I have been a customer since 2008 with 3 cars purchased. Admitingly have had ups and downs with Pacific Honda.  The thing that keeps me coming back is sd during the downs the team at Pacific Honda make a effort to make things right instead of saying audios.

Life won't be perfect. It's what people do when something goes wrong to make things right that matters.

Thanks Eric and Richard for going the extra mile to keep me as a loyal customer.<//Text>

<review>It is a wonderful experience buying a 2015 EXL V6. They matched the price of a dealership much further away. The professional of the salesman, Richard Choi, and many others like the financial department gave me a lot of help. Got a great deal whin just a few pleasant hours.

Highly recommend to others in SD area!!!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I arrived here with the intention of buying a used Accord, Civic or Elantra but ended up liking and buying a 2012 Ford Fusion Hybrid! I hadn't considered buying a Ford Fusion, I am glad they listened to my needs and found the right car for me.

My original salesman disappeared somewhere but Frank from internet sales stepped in and saw the purchasing process to the end.

Frank was a joy to work with! He even shuttled me back and forth from my residence to help me gather the bank papers I needed to close the deal.

Thanks Pacific Honda!</Review>

Traded in my Honda Civic lease for the beautiful 2013 Accord. Mark Marrow helped us with the entire process; he was friendly and extremely knowledgable about the in's and out's of leasing a vehicle. He went out of his way to ensure we were getting the best deal possible. We liked him (and the Accord) so much that my fiance traded in his car for an Accord as well! By far the quickest, easiest, and most enjoyable car dealership experience!<//Review>

Went in for an oil change and regular tire change. It was on estimate in both money and time. I actually set an alarm on my phone to go off when the time is was supposed to be done. It went off and I walked up and my car had just come off the line. I would recommend anyone with a Honda use Pacific Honda.<//Review>

I came to look at the new Honda Civic Type R . Salesman said I could not look at it, no explanation, not that it was sold, or perhaps not available to purchase. Just straight up "No you can not look at it".
Very sad, guess I'll just go purchase my new vehicle elsewhere :-(<//Review>

We had a great experience with Tarig. He was incredibly helpful, not pushy AT ALL, informative, and patient. He was a major influencer in our decision to move forward with leasing a Honda HRV. Tarig explained the features in our car and even set up my bluetooth before we drove off. We had a great experience at Pacific Honda.<//Review>

Thank you!'}</response><pictures>None</pictures><Review>What ever happened to customer service? Let me make sure when you read this review you will understand why I'm frustrated and disappointed. The whole experience could have been fantastic review. Here's why...
My Partner and I bought a 2012 Honda Civic LX brand new. Upon getting financed we already knew our finance rate was going to be higher than previously purchased Honda's from the same dealership because of some financial setbacks from 2 years prior. He had to get a car for work reasons and we didn't want some other used car with problems from a previous owner. So the sales person gave us a 17% interest rate which was not negotiable. Again it is what it is. It didn't matter we had bought 2 other brand new Honda's from Pacific Honda. They put my name as the buyer his name as the co-maker. We caught that and that was supposed to have been changed. We got every excuse from it was the bank who did that to they lost the paperwork and so on. Finally after 8 months it appears the names are corrected. He is the legal owner and I the co-signer. Now normally a co-signer does not get monthly bills unless there is a problem with the owner. Up until the last 4-6 months I have received a monthly bill and he sometimes never got one.
He has been paying 17% interest and still is and the dealership has gotten a kick back from Chase Bank for bringing us the customer to them. The amount that gets applied to the principle each month ranges from $175-$200. Our car payment is $423.00 per month. The bank and the dealership are getting more than $225 per month in interest. Now we've all heard of being ripped off but this is what I call getting the screws put to you with a smile. Any reputable business that is truly into customer service and would like a customer to be happy wouldn't do this. We knew the interest was going to be higher before going the Honda dealership but not that high. Pacific Honda is not a buy here pay here tiny dealership or car lot, they are one of the biggest Honda dealerships on the West Coast part of another parent company even larger.
So I would be very careful about buying your next car from this dealership. There has been many times we had little to eat because of struggling to pay them and all the other bills that you have in life.
The service department never answers their phone it's all voicemail. You sit on hold and then get transferred to reservations just to book service. The service advisors will not call you back and more than not the items needed fixed on the car are never done the same day because they need more time. Now remember he dropped his car off at 8-9am they have it all day, he gets a rental pays for the rental and then at 6pm comes back thinking the repairs are going to be done and they aren't. They tell you when you leave the car that they will have everything repaired when you leave it, then it's we got too busy and we had other cars that got done before yours. Why have a reservation and be told one thing then take in more cars than they can fix so that we have to come back pay for a rental car again. At least 1 time the car still had to come back a 3rd time. We have owned 4 Honda's, 2 BMW's, 2 Toyota's  and have never been treated as rude as Pacific Honda's service dept. does to it's customers. I've watched more customers than I can count on 1 hand be so frustrated they were screaming at the cashier or service advisors when picking up their cars. The response from the Honda reps., is like "Oh well" next customer... We urge you to think about where your hard earned cash is going to go and spend it with another dealership that earns your business. We've all heard this "they got your money now and your screwed" don't let that be you.< /Review>< rate>

< Review>
My recent experience with Pacific Honda was exceptional.  For real.

First off, I had done quite a bit of independent research in advance.  This involved discussions with industry-knowledgeable friends, family and co-workers - plus poring over YouTube videos and articles/research/opinions of strangers on the internet.  All of this preliminary groundwork led me to leaning very heavily toward a 2017 Honda Civic.  However, there were about five different options - each quite distinguishable from the others.  And because it is best for one to gather information in order to make an informed decision - it was clear that some further investigating along the front lines had to be done.

Thus, "armed" with my "independent research," I set out for the dealerships.

Not long into that first day of groundwork at the dealerships, my Sales Consultant at Pacific Honda turned out to be Jimmy Gardemann.  That would prove to be quite the lucky break right there.

And because though my research had me "pre-sold" on a Honda (and almost certainly a 2017 Civic), I had not then yet made up my mind on what pro/con blend of features and accessories that I would ultimately opt for.   And in all of these analyses, every positive aspect of a vehicle is counter-balanced to some degree or another by cost/price considerations.

Well, Jimmy really helped out with all that --- as he patiently, candidly and knowledgeably fielded all of my questions (and there were a lot of them).  In other instances, in a no pressure very relaxed manner - he would articulate the various pros, cons and relevant considerations. All of this here was key.  And as Jimmy can also attest, I took copious notes throughout this process - as this was a major decision not to be taken lightly.

All of these visits to the dealers took a full Saturday and Sunday (from open to close each day).  And over that span, I tried pretty much every Honda dealer in San Diego County - all in furtherance of the singular purpose of getting the car I wanted at the best price.  As I continued to negotiate for the best deal, I paid visits to a few of the dealerships more than once.

Long story short:  I got a truly fantastic deal at Pacific Honda (that was unmatchable by the nearest competitors).  Additionally, Jimmy has been absolutely wonderful since our first point of contact on the morning of the 24th right on through to the present day.  In fact, this "post-purchase" level of customer service struck me as particularly remarkable - and further inspired me to write up a review to share my thoughts on Jimmy Gardemann.

Some salespeople have a tendency to pretend to be nice - but Jimmy is the genuine article, the "real McCoy" so to speak.  He's just a legit nice guy that happens to be a straight shooter that is easy to talk to - and one who can shed a lot of light on matters acutely relevant to the Honda car-buying experience.

Summing up the final scorecard:  I landed an awesome car at an unbeatable price with remarkably strong customer service.  More specifically, I hooked a 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback Sport Touring at what I personally verified to be the best price in San Diego - and the customer service at Pacific Honda gets an A+++, from Jimmy to "Sam" (Samantha H.) to Steve and J.R.

And if anyone is looking for a fair, honest and likable car salesperson - with which to discuss the purchase of a Honda (awesome cars by the way), I would urge them to specifically ask for Jimmy Gardemann at Pacific Honda.  [And then feel free to negotiate the heck out of the price - because everybody wants to arrive at a deal that they feel really good about.]<//Review>

<review>Traded in my Honda Civic lease for the beautiful 2013 Accord. Mark Marrow helped us with the entire process; he was friendly and extremely knowledgable about the in's and out's of leasing a vehicle. He went out of his way to ensure we were getting the best deal possible. We liked him (and the Accord) so much that my fiance traded in his car for an Accord as well! By far the quickest, easiest, and most enjoyable car dealership experience!</review>< pictures>

Pacific Honda is the best! Our family has been working with Banu and Tarig for years and we keep going back to lease cars. Banu and Tarig make it very easy, they are honest and provide good guidance through the process.< /Review>

<Text>I had a horrible experience at Pacific Honda, Worst showroom ever and the staff mis-guides you. Never go for service or repairs here, while i had a minor issue in my brand new honda civic, 'James-staff member' termed it as an accidental case and charged me money. It was a scratch less car when brought to the showroom with a knocking sound coming from the wheel but James   only intention was to bilk the customer so he described the issue as an accidental issue and charged for it. I had purchased Honda's maintenance and all parts coverage plan beyond the Honda's 5yrs warranty but all of that felt like a waste of money because Honda will still Charge you if anything goes wrong with their car.
James refused a loaner car to me and dint guide me that there was enterprise car rental in the showroom. Since the time was almost 6pm I couldn't get a rental car and had to use Uber for that day and next day.
He was also rude when I asked if there is service for dropping off and picking up customers who car is in their repair shop, he answer to that was - next time buy BMW or Mercedes for that service.
I bought my Car Mossy Honda in Lemon Grove and their staff have always been kind and helpful to me, I would definitely recommend Mossy Honda.<//Text>< Pictures>

Two days ago Jimmy Gardemann sold me a Honda Fit at Pacific Honda
and I could not be more pleased. Jimmy was extremely helpful in offering choices and in teaching  us how to use the exciting new technology in this car

This Honda Fit is the best car I have ever driven with extensive new technologic magic
Such as systems to increase the safety of changing lanes   One can easily use programs from an I phone or I pod and telephone when safe using the car radio and display by Bluetooth  And all for a very low price
If you need a new car check out the Honda Fit at Pacific Honda<//Text>

<review>Just bought a HONDA PILOT ELITE from Tarig Abdullah. He was professional, not pushy, and very respectful from the test drive until a month later when I decided to buy. I had a written offer within 30 minutes of arriving that was sensible with a good APR deal too. Even though i decided to stick with my pre-approved loan, i appreciated Tarig and his manager being very up front with me without feeling that i was being worked over. They did not have the color that i wanted, so they traded with another dealership, which is a common practice. However, Tarig had to drive an hour or so away to get the color i wanted. After visiting and receiving quotes from several honda dealerships in the area, i would recommend making the drive to visit pacific honda. It literally took me sitting in other dealerships for 3+ hours just to get a written deal that was not even close to being a good deal. I am leaving the area, on my way to North Carolina, but i would buy every vehicle i could from a dealership that was like Pacific Honda. Thanks guys!<//review><GmapID>0x80dbff96ed549445:0xf98df63221cb3909< /GmapID>< UserId.>

After getting the run-around and less than stellar service at several dealerships ( I even had one tell me I needed to bring my husband next time I came in, 1950s much?) , I emailed Pacific Honda. I was very pleasantly surprised.   I got a phone call from Zach within a few minutes. He gave me their price on the 2017 civic coupe touring that i was looking for. He even gave me an out-the-door price that included tax title and license fees. He followed that up with an email so I had the numbers in writing. Their price was considerably lower than the truecar price from other dealerships.  Zach scheduled me an appt with Alex the internet sales mngr.  When i met with Alex, the numbers were the same, and I had a great test drive. Very knowledgable about the car. Easiest and fastest car buying experience ever. Out the door in less than two hours with financing that beat even my bank's rate using truecar.  I don't usually do reviews but they totally deserve the accolades. GREAT JOB!</text>

<review>BE AWARE OF SAM SAEED. Not only did he make my car buying experience miserable he changed information on my loan documents and crossed them out and caused questions to be brought up by financing company. He was very concerned about what I would say to the finance company. He is a dishonest person and if you stand up to him and ask him about agreements he gets violent and makes threats. I'm sure the other sales people at this dealership are great but this individual should be fired. He claims he helps people, well hate to break it to you but that's your job. Also, he will tell you that he is the General Sales Manager and he does have a boss, Don't be fooled by his friendly-ness over the phone. Once you get to meet him in person you'll see what a horrible person he is.</review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
One of the worst experiences I've had at a dealership.  I definitely do not recommend having service done at this dealership, it is worth an extra drive to go elsewhere.

VERY RUDE AND THEY DO NOT CARE TO HELP!

First, the moment I drove up to service it took 10 minute for someone to walk up to my car to help me out.  Once I explained that my car starter was failing, a rep kept pushing that it could be my car battery, which I definitely knew it wasn't.
After over an hour of him checking my battery I went back into the shop to get an update and he told me, "yeah your battery is fine"
After talking with him for about 10 minutes, he basically told me that he doesn't know whats going on that I should go inside and talk with customer service.
While talking with customer service, he explained that my car needed to be on stand by and "when they have time to look at it they will" also letting me know that if I wanted to get a rental car, rudely told me that it was $32 a day, when I had purchased an extended bumper to bumper warranty.  Just like any normal person, we can't like life on "stand by"
Feeling totally disrespected and very frustrated, I took my keys and left, and brought my car to another dealership that was much more helpful!</Review>

<Text>I had a great experience purchasing my new car at pacific honda dealership. I went last weekend to test drive a 2016 CRV and was very happy with my purchase. I was completely satisfied with my buying experience with Robert Olayvar. He did everything he could to make sure I was happy with my new CRV. Never at any point I felt pressured to buy the car. In fact it was quite the opposite. He was very patient with me and made the process go very fast and smooth and he got me the color I wanted with the right options. His manager was very professional and awesome. He let Robert be in charge of the entire process. I also had great experience with Dottie Dahlin at the fininace department. The process went very smooth and quick. I highly recommend Robert to anyone I know wanting to buy a car and I will definitely buy from him again when making future purchase.

When I first pulled up to express a sales man came out and said to go to the main service bc we are too busy
At the main service center Brandon warnke was extremely condescending. When I asked him about the warranty on the battery he spoke down to me. He also told me that auto zone is just down the street and that I don't have to buy another Honda battery.< /Review>

I got financed here the saturday after black friday and had the pleasure to be helped out by Jojie. Awesome guy with a great attitude and real friendly. I had originally wanted to get a Honda Accord but ended up getting a Dodge Avenger sxt and I must say this was a great choice over the accord, especially for being my first car. Definitely would recommend this place to friends and family looking for a new or used car!< /review>

First of all, anything that the sales man told you might be wrong at the end when you signed all sort of contract. I was told the certified pre - own vehical would cover this that, for 70,000 miles or X years(dont care, don't remember) whichever comes first. Then when i in the room with the financial woman, she said that its' 40,000 miles or X years whichever comes first... The salesman told me that they allow customer to charge an extended amount on credit card - $7000, then when i was in the room with that finance woman, she said that it's $5000 max.. and they don't take amex. So after it was done, i went back to complain what the salesman told me. The other person said that oh it's because you have an amex, so we can only do $5000. Then i said, no, i used a visa at the end, you still only let me charge $5000. Then this dump person changed what he said about because we don't have an amex account, we can't let you use amex even if we want to. Do you think i am stupid or what?? watch your conflicted words...

After a month, i still did not get my registration. I called and was unable to get connected because they were "busy", the receptionist asked me to leave a message and i did. i was supposed to get a call back but of course they NEVER call me back!

Then guess what, about a week later, i got my registration. Pretty sure i called, and they found out that they forgot about it and did it right away. but guess what? oh yea, they freaking got my first name and last name backwards!! bunch of irresponsible idiots! once they get you money, you can just go screw off.. that's how they do their business.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1484944211493, 'text': "Hi there-We appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

Not only did he sell me my awesome 2013 Honda Fit, he went the extra mile for me AFTER the sale.  He saved me hours of red tape and waiting.  Set up and got my security system installed asap, made sure a small part was replaced and installed it himself, filled my tires to make sure my sensor shut off, helped me recover an unreplacable time I left I'm my trade-in (yea! It was still there!), made sure I had my manual and even gave me his card to answer any follow up questions I had (which I did and he responded right away)  And did it all with a smile!

<review>I Went to PACIFIC HONDA to get buy a honda civic 2013 the dealer knew that I only wanted to lease a car and not purchase the car. They told me that only HONDA FIN can approve a lease and I was OK with that. After they pulled my credit and they told me that i was approved I wend in to sign on the new Honda and drove off on ( 1/17/2013) i paid the down payment of $1500.00 like they want too.

Today on 1/19/2013 PACIFIC HONDA called me and said that I am not approved and that they  send my credited to other bank I never told them to do that because all I wanted is a lease not a purchase. I did not want them to pull my credit with other banks because I did not want my FICO to drop. PACIFIC HONDA did not care even thought they new that I will not be getting the car if it not a lease. I was approved by the banks but I will not use the loan because I wanted a lease.

This is my worse car experience ever. I will never be buying a car PACIFIC HONDA or A honda.</review>< Pics>

<user>115017668500740543619</user><review>Did my research on TrueCar, Edmunds, and KBB.  Emailed different dealers and got the best rate from another dealer.  Jeffrey told me if I came in they would negotiate a better deal (price difference was only 15 bucks).

Alex Orloff greeted me and my family and was happy enough to help us pick out a car and its color. I told him that Jeffrey would sweeten the pot if I came in and they decided to match the price and thrown in some door edge guards I wanted (retail $60).  I told him that sounded okay but asked he if could throw in some all weather floor mats...either free or discounted.  He was happy to oblige.  When I got the paperwork it turns out they added the floor mats at retail price and also added a Karr alarm ($795) and some sort of sealant ($795). It added another $40 to my monthly.  I told them to take both of them off (of course I got the usual schmeal about why I need it)

Overall I had an okay experience, except for all the sales tactics they use to add stuff onto my lease that I don't need.<//review>< Response>

<review>We leased a 2015 Honda Accord EX-L from Pacific Honda on Tuesday 12/30/14.  Quite simply it was the best deal in all of San Diego County.  I checked all the ads, both print and on-line, including the factory web site for specials.  Bar none, no one could beat the offer from Pacific Honda.  From my initial contact with Zach Driscoll to get details of the transaction, this was a super car leasing experience.  Zach was informative, candid and polite.  He arranged for us to meet with Jimmie Gardemann, an Internet Sales Specialist.  And Jimmie was great too.  We looked for the color choice on their vast lot of new cars, and found one that we were thrilled with.  After filling out the credit application, we met with Paul Tavares, the Finance Manager.  He too was informative, candid and quite helpful in closing the deal.  If you are in the market for a Honda, don't waste your time elsewhere.  Rush down to Pacific Honda.  Their specials go through January 5, 2015.  Happy New Year San Diego.  And Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) to Pacific Honda for my wife's new car.<//review></record>

I was searching for the best lease deal possible. I called a friend in LA that brokers leased vehicles and he got me a deal for a 2012 Honda Civic LX. However, the only stipulation was the car had to be picked up from Thousand Oaks Honda in LA. Given the drive from El Cajon to Thousand Oaks was going to take a full day of driving and underlying costs; I opted to call around.

First dealership I called was Tipton Honda. I called twice and no one answered the phone. Even though they were the closest to my area, they demonstrated to me my business doesn't matter.  Second place I called was Pacific Honda. I spoke to a guy named Zak and told him the deal I was getting in LA. He said we can match that deal give or take a little. I made an appointment the next day and went in to talk to Robbie. We went over the details and was introduced to the sales manager Paul.

We closed the deal on 12/22/12 and went home with a brand new 2012 Silver Honda Civic LX. All around above par customer service and quality of delivery. Pacific Honda is destined to make customers happy.

Good on you Pacific Honda!</text>

James Morrison was our sales representative and I have nothing but good reviews for him. He was very knowledgeable about all the cars on the lot and unlike other salesmen that I have encountered at different dealerships, he was not pushy and actually listened to what I was looking for and didn’t show me cars that I couldn’t afford. He was honest about the features on all the cars and after I test drove one car I found the car I wanted and was very pleased with my decision. James introduced my dad and I to Jojie Deflin one of the finance specialists who helped us work out the logistics of buying the car. Jojie was very helpful and made it a comfortable experience. As a first time buyer I was nervous about the whole process but I am extremely happy with my experience at Pacific Honda thanks to their great sales reps James and Jojie and I drove away with a beautiful car.</Review><Rate>5</Rate>< UserId.>

<text>I have been having such a hard time finding a car. My mom finally referred me to Jojie at Pacific Honda. He has been so helpful and knowledgable. I was originally looking for a used car but he showed me the options that were available in new cars. I ended up choosing a 2012 Honda Accord. I am a new car owner, how exciting! When you are in the market for a new or used car, Jojie is knowledgable in both!!! Ask for him and he will give you the best deal possible...

Pacific Honda LET ME DOWN!!!!!. Terribly disappointed at how I was treated, a returning customer. Definately will not be return there for my next car upgrade and not recommending any of my family, friends, co-workers or facebook friends.

I recently purchased a 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid ($38,000). One month after, with only 1000 miles on the vehicle....as I was driving home from work on the I-8 freeway coming down the mountain (For those of you who knows I-8, up in the mountain by Campo and Pine Valley, there are only a few cars on the road at night), suddenly I heard a LOUD POP. The tire pressure light on my vehicle lit up so I immediately pulled to the side. Turns out one of the rear the tire blew a giant hole on the inside wall. I coudn't see what it looks like and only fetl it since it was late a night. I thought....Luckily I purchased Honda Care Roadside asistance for the car...so I called. They always say within an hour, but 4 hours later the tow truck came and dropped my car off at Pacific Honda. The next morning I called and the service department said it was going to cost over $200 to replace the tire. I spoke to several people but it was not cover under any warranties. I keep telling them how could it not be covered, it's not like I ran over a nail of something, "THE TIRE BLOW OUT".  No one listens, no one cares...all they care is...Oh, you paid $38,000 for the car? now give us some more $$....you're nobody.

So instead of me raving about the great services and support I got on my brand new 2015 car from Pacific Honda to everyone who heard about my blow out, I am just telling everyone how deeply disapointed I am.<//Review>

While I've had good experiences here in the past, including from James Morrison who sold us our used Honda Pilot, I often feel like I'm on the receiving of a sales pitch here (at times, I feel like I'm simply getting gouged). I was told I needed to replace my "dirty power washing fluid" for $160 ("but we have a coupon...") yesterday. I was pretty bummed with PH when the first few sites that came up on a Google search said this was extremely unnecessary. Two or three sites had mechanics going so far as to say it was just a scam. The star that is Pacific Honda continues to dim a little more for me with every visit. With the expiration of my Pacific Care card, I may just start going to Honda of Mission Valley. A ver. At least the people who work here are friendly, including Liana Gorney, who saw my displeasure about getting another Honda recall and gave me immediate and personal attention to move towards resolving it.</Text>

<review>My husband and I bought 2012 Odyssey EXL at a price close to the lowest quote received on email.  Our buying experience was pretty pleasant with the Honda dealer on Convoy St in San Diego.

But the true colors came out when I referred my friend's family to this dealer. If you want to be treated like a s***, please go ahead and experience it yourself. This dealear does not know what a customer service is. Especially the so called "manager" named Paul and Salesperson Robby. After buying the Odyssey at this dealer, I referred my friend's family who was also looking into buying the same vehicle. When they went and told Robby that their friend(me) bought the vehicle at x amount, the Salesperson did not believe them and accused them of lying. My friends felt very disrespected and mistreated by this salesperson and the manager. So I went with my friends to the dealer the next day to prove that I was the friend who bought the vehicle there the week before. My friend's couple and me and husband were not even welcomed. Paul the manager came out at the door said he was not willing to make any offer. He lied by saying that his salesperson spent the whole day with my friends trying to negotiate the price when it was only for an hour. The manager was NOT willing to hear any of my friends had to say and only believed what his salesperson told him. Paul did make a ridiculous offer saying that my friends would have to pay $400 more if they wanted to buy the vehicle. When I complained that this was not what I had expected for my friends to be treated, the manager didn't care. He said there were eight other Honda dealers in San Diego that my friends could go to. This so called manager didn't even seem to care whether I go on all the car sites and yelp leaving negative comments. He said I could go and complain all I wanted. This dealer is full of crap and disrespect for customers!!! And you know this dealer had the guts to call my friends that evening saying that they were willing to make the offer. Who in the world want to go back to the same dealer that treated like you a piece of s*** and not welcomed into the dealer would go back and buy the car. That was even more humiliating and disgusting getting a call back from the dealer. I still get very upset and infurious when I think about the treatment that my friends and I received at this dealer.

My message to the Pacific Honda General Manager, hire a private consultant and reexamine how your managers and salespersons are treating customers.  If you want to continue to have customers being disrespected, mistreated, humiliated and disgusted by your staff, please don't do anything.  Customers are not STUPID and they will do their homework and go to EIGHT OTHER HONDA DEALERS just like your manager Paul said.

If you are in San Diego and looking to buy a Honda, The BOTTOM LINE, DON't go to Pacific Honda<//review></record></dataset><record>

They were not pushy and they helped me, litteraly holding my hand through the entire journey and process of buying my first car. I recently sold that car and was looking to buy another vehicle. So today I decided it was time to get another car and the first place I thought of was Pacific Honda. Not only did they surpass my expectations yet again but they also picked me up this morning to bring me in to look at cars. Now its a few hours later and I am leaving with yet another amazing car and feel confident in telling people that Pacific Honda truly is the greatest place to go when you are in search of a new vehicle. Wether you are new to the buying experience or you dont have the best credit both of which I am familiar with they can surely help you out. I would highly recomment pacific honda to anyone and everyone. The gentleman that helped me out was jojie and he could of not been any more helpful. I know where I am going to buy the third car from :)</Review>< user_name>

Really Bad! we all know life is not perfect. I've gone thru bad times (two years) but been trying to get it to together, great job, things are looking up so I go online to get a loan for poeple with bad credit I do have a car but wanted to up grade so Pacific Honda comes up as a loaner. they e-mail me congratulating me that applacation has been acepted and aprove everthing looks good no problem we are going to do everthing to get you in a car! I knew is was to good to be true I told the saleman at the time the honest truth I was being straight and honest about the whole situation that did not want to waste hes time or mine! it's been three day since he said he was going to call me the same day. not even a message or a tex the moral of the story is trust loyal and a men's word. simple word's no we can't sale a car. just a phone call guy's</Review>

Poor customer service. Even with full warrantee they don't give loaner cars like more dealers do, their ride hours are highly limited, and the waiting lounge relative to most other honda service centers is non-existent</Review>

<review>I have a very bad experiences that I want to share to all Honda consumers about this Pacific Honda Dealership. It happened that I just relied on their good online reviews and comments rating, but in reality it was not true, and even worse, a wrong choice of dealership that suffered my normal life’s routine.
First, the Sales Department. I have been so welcome to them when was I about to purchase the car, then after I got the car, they were no longer fairly responding to all my inquiries and follow-ups or help and assistance, It’s feel like they ignored me after the purchase. The fact that, they sold me their Junk 2015 CR-Vibrator that’s now stocked in my parking lot. I was so upset when I realized the problem. They really know about the vibration of the car or whatever issue it might have ever since the way they sold me that with 200+ miles, something fishy on it that I ignored. Yes, it was a mistake on my part, but fooling and ignoring after the purchase is not really good to any business. These are the worst people I ever deal with, and I hope they will enjoy their lives after fooling average consumers around in San Diego like me.
Second, the Service Department. I purchased my CR-Vibrator with add option Roof Side Rail to install which is part of the deal with Sales person. Now, the sales person told me that a Service Advisor will call me in three days after the purchased. It’s was taken two weeks when they called me after several follow-up (by e-mails and Phone calls.). Then, I bring my CR-Vibrator early morning (@6am to get first to serve) for installation, and the Service Advisor said it will takes 3 hrs max. to complete that, so I choose to wait and he (Service Advisor) also marked up that in the Work Order sheet (in big print “WAIT”) that I am going to “WAIT” coz I also planning to buy some Accessories. Then, after 3 hrs of waiting, they told me that they have a wrong part (A Cross Bar instead of Roof Side Rail). “What? You guys let me wait for 3hrs for nothing, you should know what you guy working on by referring to the VIN and the Sales coordination before setting a schedule, that Crazy”. So I went to my work late for nothing happened. And then, a week passed by, they set another schedule again (by “again” my continuous follow-up through E-mails and Phone Calls), and on the same day in the afternoon, I received a call from them, and they told me that my car was “SCRATCHED” during the rail installation, and need to bring to the body shop and will take another week to complete. Wow! What a coincidence, it is a Brand New Car, are these guy Professional? They obviously dump and Stupid, Right? And then later, they charged me for Labor cost. For what? Material and installation are automatically includes in the option when you buy a car.
That’s so stressful experience with this dealership. The only things in their mind is to sell their products and that’s it. This is the worst ever. I cannot believe that there are something like that in here.  Well, I believe in “KARMA”, and I know there’s a payback for this.
“For all the wrong reasons”. I will definitely not recommend this dealership to everyone I knew who prefer to by Honda brand.<//review>< time>

The service adviser was very arrogant and all the responses were filled with sarcasm. If you choose to go there, do not use Brandon Warnke as your service adviser. If you do, do not expect any courtesy or customer service.< /Review>

Worst car buying experience I had, get a deal done last night with the car salesmen and sales manager , had to finish the paper work process today, I get a text message from them saying that they are looking forward to see me to finish of the deal, get on my way to the dealership to get a call a few minutes from arriving that the sales manager back down on the deal, the sad part my credit was run and now I'm left with a lower credit score, didn't expect this from my favorite car brand at all, very unprofessional</text>

The service adviser was very arrogant and all the responses were filled with sarcasm. If you choose to go there, do not use Brandon Warnke as your service adviser. If you do, do not expect any courtesy or customer service.< /review>

I purchased a car from Pacific Honda and decided to cancel my gap coverage on February 24th 2021. I was first told that it would take around one month to be reimbursed.  After 6 weeks, I called to check on the reimbursement status for multiple days, leaving multiple messages for Richard from finance. I then had to go into their office on my day off because no one would contact me back. Richard then told me that it would be roughly two months from when it was canceled. He also told me he would send me a new confirmation that my coverage has been canceled and I still have not received it. For the past few days I have been reaching out to their finance department and no one has returned any of my calls. It has now been 15 weeks since I canceled the reimbursement and I do not know when I will get it. One bright spot is Gina has been very kind and patient at reception. Unfortunately I have only come across unprofessionalism and a complete lack of customer support from the finance department. If anyone is considering purchasing additionally polices from Pacific Honda when purchasing your car, DO NOT, if you decide to cancel, Pacific Honda will not handle your reimbursement in a remotely professional or timely manor.<//text>
