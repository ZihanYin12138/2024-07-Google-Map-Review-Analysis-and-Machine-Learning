<review>Hui Hui made it really easy for us. Jake met us on the bay with paddleboards ready, and when we were done he swung by within 5 minutes to pick them up. It was a perfect day for paddleboarding, and nice not to worry about logistics.</review><pics>None</pics>< username>

Super great service , extremely friendly to work. My group of 4 was assured by Jake and couldn’t have been an easier process. Jake was on time for the drop off initially , and my friends and I even got a little lost on the way back , found a different street called Jake and he accommodated us no problem! Have already recommended a few friends that seen my stories over the weekend to give them a try! Thanks Jake!< /review>

<text>HuiHui is a great paddle board rental company. The boards are great quality and the pickup/drop off is super convenient. The guys are knowledgeable and explained to my group proper paddling technique and had advice for the best spots to paddle. I’d highly recommend renting from HuiHui for group parties, family outings, or just a relaxing paddle with a friend. I’m a repeat customer and already booked my next rental.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Super convenient and Ryan was easy to work with.  We were able to do a last-minute rental with Ryan and he was very accommodating.  The convenience of having the boards dropped off where you plan to spend the day can't be beat.   It's much easier and less stressful than having to lug that heavy board several blocks between cars and other beachgoers.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

We had an amazing experience in San Diego paddle boarding in Mission Bay with our 3 kids. This company was very professional and met us with paddle boards and life jackets and on time and very friendly ! Highly recommended! No hassle with filling out forms and showing id's. Simple!</Text>

Called last minute and these guys made it happen, hooked me up with a nice board and were awesome and super easy to get in contact and work with. They are definitely the people to rent from, they even offered to help hook me up with a board of my own so I'll be contacting them again soon!<//Review>

<Text>Awesome company to work with. A group of my friends were in town for a long weekend bachelor party and wanted to rent some SUPs. They delivered the board to us within ~15 minutes. After we were done they came for pickup in about the same time frame. Great prices, great service, and the equipment was in good shape. 10/10 or 5 stars - Would recommend.<//Text>< gmap_id>

SO much fun and Chris, our instructor, was patient, nice and helpful. Relaxing, beautiful, and a great workout. Peaceful and refreshing on the water.< /review>

< Review>
We had a great experience with HU'I HU'I. Kris was very helpful and professional. He took us to a great spot with perfect, calm water and a great spot for the kids to play in the sand. I highly recommend them in San Diego for a paddle board experience.</Review>

Great playground and the ball field is nice but the 3 handfuls of pills someone dumped in and around the playground was criminal. What kind of horrible person does that in an area where kids are supposed to play!!!< /review>

So my wife & I are always looking for a fantastic authentic American BBQ joint which is almost impossible to find these days. Well we've located our haven in C J's BBQ & Fish. The service was fantastic, the 2 gentlemen who worked there were very pleasant & the food was out of this world. I ordered the 2-way & chose pork ribs & chicken with mild sauce which comes with 2 sides as well (we both ordered fries & BBQ baked beans) for $21. My wife ordered the small catfish nuggets which was $14. Now I know the prices may seem high to some (who don't usually frequent BBQ establishments) but it's really not considering we both had enough left over for an entire 2nd meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in search of authentic high quality food. Next time we go we plan to try the peach cobbler & some cake. (Oh & almost forgot, we also ordered 3 hushpuppies for $1 & they were extraordinary as well. We were extremely pleased).</Text>

Definitely a backyard BBQ ribs, pork and chicken making place. Great ribs. My plate with a coke cost me $18. It was the regular plate and it's a good portion. Sadly enough the flies don't help the ambiance. Next time I'll do takeout.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>This place is right outside of Travis AFB. It looks kinda seedy, maybe not totally kept up on both the inside and outside, but wow. The food is definitely worth it, some of the best bbq I've had in a while. Not overly cheap, but the portion sizes are GENEROUS, and absolutely delicious. You can tell that they take pride in their food, and I'll definitely be going back.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Good food. Very slow service. Even though other people ordered on the  phone it should not take an hour for lunch to be served. My cousin and I ordered a sandwich, took an hour due to 5 other people ordered.</Review>< username>

Some of the best RIBS ever and ivy eaten them all over the country, great medium BBQ sauce, it had a nice after burn, but not too hot. The Cole slaw and beans were really good and the Cole slaw was super good. We'll be going back!</text>

When first coming in we were automatically told there is 1 hr 45 min wait for ribs, over an 1 hr wait for ribs and 30 min wait for chicken. That was at 3:30. Decided to order chicken (which I was told is frozen so that’s why it takes 30min) and waited over an hr....for FRIED chicken wings! I rode past this place plenty of times and wanted to try but don’t waste your time because they will surely waste yours!<//review>

I go fork the pork ribs and I get the spiciest bbq sauce. They are incredible. Super soft, tender, and smokey. I wouldn't know where to go to find any that taste better or if that's even possible. They're like candy to me. Don't play yourself, get them ribs at CJs. You won't be disappointed.<//text>

The food tastes great, but there were some issues. First, I ordered the bbq beef (brisket) and half of the pieces were all fat. I also had to pay $1.50 extra for greens, that were in a 4 ounce cup! Come on now.<//text>

The food is alright but the customer service is horrible, those sisters are rude. Greet your customers don't stand there with a funny look on your face. Also the prices keep going up which I understand, but can we get a portion for what we pay for. I guess my friends & I drove from Sacramento to get a stare down, we must be cute.<//review>

It was off the beaten path, some sedans, Subaru to be exact, got stuck on the road.  4X4 or high clearance vehicles are recommended to go camping here.  Dirt, mud, snow while we camped, and lots of potholes to get there.  Bring your own tp!
But once there, quite beautiful.<//Text>

Great campground with large camp spots. Each space comes with one dedicated parking spot (and many could fit two vehicles parked tandem), picnic table, bear cabinet, and fire pit. We could easily fit 4-5 large tents in our space. Very dog friendly. No water but they have relatively clean vault toilets. Hiking trails close by.</text>

2nd on July 4th weekend. I got my site early on the 3rd, hist wasn't there and left a note that would be back in 2 hours but forgot to write the time....I couldn't pay so I left a  note telling him I'd be back at  night. So when there the guy complain I didn't pay...:(.
Third time two weeks after. We got Friday night and the campground was full. We drive around and notice that some people was leavi g next day. So we talked with him and ask if we can stay just for the night in any place (there's plenty of room) he said no in the campground, so we come back next morning 7 am to check and wait for a site and the guy told us that we must way for for him to change the no vacancy sign. I td him and want to drive and wait for a site while people leaving (we'd done that before others campground) the host said no so I reply what you're  no friendly with us, we'd been here before and you know we're nice and quiet people so the guy apologixe and explain that many people wants to do the same (we didn't see it )then told us to park and wait outside. We did it and walk to check sites when he called us and assign a site for us.
After all guy was nice. Keep bathrooms clean all time.< /text></record></dataset><record>

This campground was nice and the sites were roomy enough for about 3 or 4 tents depending on size. Restrooms are clean it just has the usual problem of, make sure you bring your own toilet paper or you'll spend all the time trying to get the toilet paper off the roll.

I have two gripes about this campground, but only one pertains to the Campground itself. First is that some of the sites are very close to the road. You can take about 12 paces and you'll be next to the road. I honestly thought it wasn't going to be a problem and then nighttime rolled around and there is suddenly a lot of vehicles passing through.

Second is that MAKE SURE that you have a high clearance vehicle or you will have a rough time driving to the Campground. There are 3 roads, but 2 of the roads I drove down were unmaintained dirt roads. I myself drove in a high clearance vehicle, but my friend came along with a sedan and he did not have a good time.

Overall I enjoyed my time here and would come again.< /text><time>1537829344261< /time><UserId.>110403932015735209553< /UserId.>< pictures>

<text>Amazing place, large campground so your not awkwardly close to your neighbors. Lots of trails to explore. BUT....they need to up security some one cut down a small tree in their campground to use for wood, and the next day a truck came to a different campground with wood on their roof.....that looked a lot like the trees around us. It's really depressing and infuriating to see people destroying our forest. I'm willing to pay a couple bucks more for my campground so they can hire extra help.<//text>< response>

The campground itself was nice and a beautiful place to stay but the new camp host they have up there is a little aggressive and he seems power hungry and jumps at an opportunity to show his authority which ruins the camping experience the prior camp host was a friendly outgoing guy that enhances the experience but this new guy made me uncomfortable and he had a tendency  to reprimand campers if given the chance and just made me want to leave because he created uncomfortable environment to camp in which defeats the whole purpose of going camping and trying to relax from a long week not pile on the stress so unfortunately I will find other spots to camp while he's up there as the camp host<//review>

<text>Free camping area to the east down Holcomb Valley road.  We stayed there two night and very nice.   Major downside is that there are NO CAMPFIRES ALLOWED.  Only gas type stoves.  But if campground is full like in our case it was 2nd best.  Photos posted are taken in that area and not at the OFFICIAL campground where you pay fee.</text>< user>

This is one of my all time favorite campgrounds. It's generally clean up kept and quiet. It's a great little git away after a long week. Big beautiful trees. Spacious sites. Great for one person or a group. Looking forward for this drought to end so the fire pits cam be used again.< /Review>

This is a very nice campground.

The Camp hosts where very friendly and knowledgeable.
There are a lot of places to park extra vehicles if you have a large party.
The pricing is very reasonable at $20/day $5/day per extra vehicle.

Although the website lists restrictions on the number of people/vehicles allowed per site. When we where there they where happy to accommodate our large group and did not force us to use multiple sites.

The only negatives are that the toilets are vault style and smelly, and there is NO water... not even a pump well. (Both of which are posted on there website so they where to be expected).

Over all good large sites, close to off-roading, climbing, and hiking areas, and very remote for the area. All pluses!< /review>

Each site has parking for 2 cars (can get 3 in a pinch) as well as a picnic table and firepit, the sites are fairly close together so if you're looking for a remote quiet wilderness experience, this is probably not the place to have it.</review>< Pics>

Very nice and basic and 20-30 mins from big bear city where there are grocery stores and whatever else you will need. Dirt roads fairly bumpy but is accessible by car just will take alot longer due to driving slow so 20 mins becomes 45 mins of driving to and from the camp site and all the trails around the campsite.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>This camp site is not too bad. I would recommend an SUV or an AWD vehicle to get to it because I had to go through a dirt road that was not fully maintained so I was going up and down pot holes for about 4 miles, but lucky I had my Mitsubishi Outlander with S-AWC to take on that road. I wouldn't recommend a car that is too pretty to handle rough roads ha ha. When you do get through the road, the camp site is straight ahead that is pretty nice. Plenty of shade, trees, camp sites, and bear boxes. There is a walking and bike path. They do charge for the site plus extra cars. There is a person that walks around to collect money.</text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

This is one of few campgrounds in Big Bear where you can have fires most of the year. Fills up quick on weekends and is first come first served.<//review>

<review>My family and I got there at 9:00am on Saturday to get a place to camp but was full already! We had to camp outside the area with no chance of wood fire!!! No water around just the Big Bear around 30 minutes away and dirty lake by the way!! Didn't liked it at all<//review></record>

(Translated by Google) I have been to many camping sites ... And this is one of the ones I liked the most, children can play, run, enjoy, we can make a bonfire, there are bathrooms ... it's spacious, I recommend it!

Dr. Manhas and his team are excellent and take really good care of their patients. I trust them with my fur baby because they treat him with such compassion and care. I have been taking my fur baby here since his first vet visit about the age of 8 weeks. He is 9 months old now and the care here is excellent.</text>

<text>Dr.Manhas is truly a soothing soul to our furry (or non) friends. His staff is AMAZING and pricing based on practical advise with OPTIONS and transparent. I was given back my personal dignity with a smelly, tough case Shih Tzu I had previously been judged for. I was assured I did what I could have! And, I've lost my giant Rottweiler companion there too. Complete support, compassion & understanding was received and all at one of my ( and Ricky Bobby's) darkest hour. I've referred EVERY pet owner I've met to them!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6xB_fJPJe3XbzhsY-wkWc-idq1pxpLOqQVj6b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPtJatlpLwT_ExDOl1l346ZPuCAuSPiD2UYkLx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF3ZaWOII_A_o4SJBCjcnC6jpu3CBk_xTAPKsS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9_HL0iIaLDOrLRmdSCZKLW3KxvddIVewQkT6G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrk9yKtYRZhrpFaFi1w8IjEorxRUovmoyi_5JI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2pIWk2Lh_xwoDOU20BnmjSi5IEi8FdMbGip18=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I brought my very sick puppy in,  after one of the ladies at the front desk convinced me to, due to his symptoms.  It was a very scary thing to see my fur baby so sick, especially while being unemployed, and this being my first puppy ever, but the ladies were very polite and they assured me that everything was going to be ok.  The cost of the emergency visit was affordable. Within a matter of about 20 minutes after my puppy received an Ivy and medication, he began to feel better. Then  2 hours later, he was back to normal. I literally walked in expecting the worst but hoping for the best. They ran a couple of different tests and I received medication for him, they knew exactly what they were doing. The vet and the assistant did an amazing job curing my baby.  They are very sweet and very caring.< /review>

we go to this place and have been going for at least four or five years now we love them. It is a wonderful place they take great care of our current pet and the two pets we had before. I cannot say enough and I trust them very very much.

I cannot recommend them highly!<//Text>

<user_name>nini nguyen</user_name><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><text>Ummmm I’ll give stars for the prices but the vet there wasn’t really informative. I had brought my kitten in for some hair loss (stress cleaning/itching) and I had ask the vet if there was any natural remedies to ease my kittens itch, gave me nothing at all. Then did this UVA light (Purple light) to check for fungal infection, then tells me the skin doesn’t look discolored skin (I guess fungal infections can cause discoloring which is detectable under that light) then proceeds to suggest a $125 test for that fugal infection. Why would I need to take a test for something that didn’t even show up under the light?  I suggested some antibiotic cream to see if that’s safe for the kittens skin, all he said to me was “I can’t force you to do anything“ and “ to wash your hands”. Like sir, I’m not asking you to tell me what to do. I’m ask for helpful suggestions or tips to help manage the itching and hair loss. I just need some sort of guidance or cream to soothe my kitten. Just absolutely nothing. My current vet place is closed due to Covid but they were always so helpful with suggestions and tips. Actually every vet I have went to has given me some sort of advice or some at home remedies.

I walked out with just a cone and completely irritated for the lack of listening/understanding and communication with the vet. The staff was amazing so I have no complaints about them.

Again, their prices are pretty good.<//text><Rate>3</Rate><userid>107727471367355642421<//userid>< Time>

Cost and procedure of treatment was explained to me beforehand, including the take home medications, which seemed inexpensive for pet care, in my opinion. There were no surprise costs, and I was not pressured into any decisions. The procedure was quick and went smoothly. I am a total worry wort, and they were very accommodating and understanding. Will be coming back for all of my pets' medical concerns in the future.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Love this pet hospital. My kitten was sick with an upper respiratory infection, and he really wasn't feeling good at all. They got him in the same day, no extra charge! My kitten is all better and this is our new pet hospital.<//review>

I highly recommend this place. After another veterinarian refused to shave my dogs neck ( had infection) I had brought the dog to this clinic. Staff was super friendly.  Doctor hisself shaved the neck and allowed me to remain in the room. After shaving the neck we realize the extent of the infection.

Doctor provided appropriate antibiotics and dog recovered quickly.  This clinic is very much affordable, doctor is knowledgeable and staff is friendly. Doctor took his time to discuss the case with me,  instead of rushing .

Again I highly recommend capital pets animal hospital< /text>

<Review>I brought my two pets here on March 13th of 2020 and I had a positive experience.
All the staff at the front were super nice and very attentive.
The vet was a really nice guy and he was able to fit all the procedures in one day.
My pup needed a deep dental cleaning and I thought we would have to come back but he was able to do it during the same visit.
He explained all the procedures well, he was super nice, not pushy like others vets try to push products that you may not need. I would definitely come back to this vet.
Ava and Boo liked his gentleness as well.

I came back to him on April 13th because one or my babies needed immediate care. I did not have a prior appointment. I called that morning and explained that the situation was urgent and the staff checked for cancellations and they were able to fit me in within 1 hour. I really wanted to see this particular vet who is now the continuing vet for my current and future pets. I just trust him and his advice. He took very good care of my fur baby and took his time and never made me feel like he was in a rush to go to the next patient. He answered all my questions with so much patience. Super nice guy. He also called me the next day to check on my pet and his condition. How many vets do you know that will do that? None.

The staff was nice and Dr. Mahas was very thorough in his explanations for what he needed to do to care for my pet. Most definitely a great place to take your animals for their care.< /text>

This vet denied my request for a respiratory disease test of my animal. Insisted on a test costing ×4 the cost of our visit and blamed me for my animal gaining weight when there was a time if she left they house she had a wheezing attack. Do not trust this vet they gave me results a day late at the wrong number so they could ask my sister why she hadnt brought her dog in to give them money<//Review>

<Review>I really like this place. The vet is a very nice man. The other staff are also friendly. I believe they saved my cat's life. Kenobi is 13 and had many rotting teeth. He had to be on antibiotics and prednisone and even then he could barely eat and stayed on the bed all day. The other vet wanted to charge thousands to have his teeth pulled. This place was much more reasonable. Today Kenobi is like a whole new cat - he eats a lot and has a lot of energy. Before I was considering having him put down. I am very grateful. I have my cat back and I think he has another few years in him, which makes me happy.< /Review><Date>1595615672884<//Date><rating>5< /rating>< resp>

<text>Took my cat here to get spayed. I called almost every place in Sacramento pricing a cat spay. They were definitely the most affordable outside spay clinic organizations, which you have to book out at least 1 month in advance. The staff was very kind and  were also very accommodating. They worked me in last minute.

The best part they didn’t surprise me with any extras and didn’t try to push additional services on me. The fee they quoted was the actual fee for the spay - that includes the office visit, collar, antibiotics, and pain killers. Very refreshing.

My only complaint is they were remodeling their clinic and it the clinic seemed a little dumpy and gave the impression of being dirty. That could have been because of the remodel. I will certainly go back here again for vaccinations, which were comparable to vaccine clinic prices, and update this review with post remodeling information.< /text>< Name>

This place is fabulous. I took my adopted Chihuahua in today for dental problems. The vet was kind, caring and very thorough. He explained what actually "needed" to be done and since I'm short on funds what "had" to be done. He even showed me. I'm thrilled to find a Vet that cares not only about the pet but about the owners cost problems. I have already recommended them to family and friends. We have a new Vet now for Toby.< /review>

<text>Great veterinarian. The staff were friendly. They take care of your animals. They seem very knowledgeable and understanding of what they're talking about. Prices are about what they are at any veterinarian in the area. They offer other items such as special Foods for your pets, Etc. Parking is easy, and free. Making an appointment is best, however in an emergency you could walk in for some assistance.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

A very impersonal veterinary office. I had brought my cat in for the 4th time in 2 weeks because she wasn't eating, and his previous suggestions for treatment weren't working. The vet couldn't figure out what was wrong with my girl and he literally laughed at me when I suggested she might have lymphoma (because she wasn't eating and I had found a couple lumps on her neck/back). I told him that it wasn't funny and I was just trying to get my girl feeling better again. He read out loud to me the results of the x-rays (which he had shown me the pics of a week before) because he was trying to show me that nothing was wrong with her, but I noticed that at the end of the analysis from the x-ray lab, it suggested that she get a CT scan, which he hadn't told me when the results first came in. 3 days later, she got the scan and they found lymphoma and she was put down soon afterwards. She dealt with an extra week of not eating and being very sick because he didn't give me that info (that I paid $400 for). I would never ever bring a pet back to this vet. I know that sometimes you have to do many expensive tests to identify a problem, but I did not pay $800 for blood tests and x-rays to be essentially mocked in the office for being worried about my girl not being well. Did they think I wanted to take my timid cat to the vet 4 times in 2 weeks? It was a nightmare for me, but I just wanted to do what I could to get my sweet 13 year old kitty feeling good again and eating. He made me feel awful in a super stressful time, and what ended up being my final days with my best friend.

Also, there's a very sweet cat that is always around and, though I love cats and he is a good one, it can agitate other cats or dogs in the office who don't like other cats. I had to constantly "play defense" to keep him away from my sick cat that doesn't like other cats. DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE IF YOU WANT A VET WHO VALUES THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF YOUR PET!< /review>

Great experience and the receptionist was an absolute doll. I called and got an appointment the next day for my kitten. Not only did the doctor explain everything as he did it but his prices LITERALLY can't be beat. I'd definitely bring my animals here again in the futute. Overall, it was a great experience from a local vet.<//text>

This is one of the best pet care I have ever gone to. The whole staff is beyond kind and friendly. The vets are helpful and great at what they do.<//Text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>If you are looking at a lot of one star reviews please beware of them.  Dr. Manhas bought the practice recently and he is a gentle and kind man who will give you his honest opinion and let you decide on the course of treatment for your fur baby.

I have two older cats with different problems.  Senior pets aren't cheap and I'm so happy that APC truly is affordable.

I took my Siamese to 2 other vets and one of them looked in his mouth and within 10 seconds said I needed to pull out all of his teeth at a cost of $1,400 and it may not solve the problem.  I said no.  I came home and did my own research on Google and they said that this was very common with Siamese cats.  Dr. Manhas is quite conservative with his approach to testing and didn't recommend the most expensive procedure first.  We started out slowly with different medications and we are trying to figure out what is going to work best for my boy.  We may never come up with the answer because from what I have read on line what he has is not curable.  I know this and he knows this but since we are at the beginning stages I want to keep him as comfortable as possible and keep him around for as long as I can so long as he isn't in pain.

While others may love the vet who wanted to charge me $1,400 I say please continue to go there.  I'm sure her brand new Mercedes isn't cheap!  I'll keep going here.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809ac5eb2014166d:0xfcc4357d368a1b48<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>In all my years of having pets Dr. Solomon has been an amazing. He's quick, to the point, but at the same time very patient. His prices cant be beat when it comes to the basic shots for cats and dogs. And he's very gentle with them. If you need a vet, come to him!</Text>< Time>

Outstanding and affordable vet care. The Doctor and his staff are very perfesaional and are full of compastion and  patient and realy no what they are doing. Highly recomended and especialy if you are tight on money . I believe they have the cheapest rates in town and they well work with you  if you can not afford  care for your beloved pet.</Text>

<text>My sister and I decided to get our auras read and the experience was so sublime. The person who helped us seemed knowledgeable and friendly. The store itself is big and has an array of crystals, candles, smudge, incense and books. The environment and vibe is very peaceful<//text>< Pics>

This store has such a great location.  The decor is amazing.  Very relaxing vibes and kind, warm hearted service. They are really nice and open to questions.  They offer unique services like intuitive healing and photo aura chakra reports.< /Review>

there was so much cultural appropriation. the main thing for smudging was white sage. there seemed to be little to no representation of people who live the culture that is shown here. there is also a horrible variation of crystals. the ones there were small, and expensive. every item there seemed to be from a company that culturally appropriated buddhism, hinduism, and other spiritual practices. not the best place<//text>

The reader Lisa was absolutely wonderful and I’m so thankful I stopped to come in and get this reading. She was so refreshing and talented and I could tell she truly cares about the people who come in to see her.</Review>

My favorite place to buy incense, and all spiritual related items. They have a great collection of bells, decorative items, pendulums, minerals, oils, books and high spiritual vibes. Plus we get to walk by the beach every time we visit. My wife and I love it!<//Text>

Really lovely zen shop. Had everything from jewerly, meditation pillows, incense, smudge sticks, to CBD for dogs and sound healing. Costumer service was 100% great. Would visit again in a heart beat!</Text>

They have great selection of books, oils, perfumes, and singing bowls. What I really enjoyed was the aura reading (prices were $15, $25, and $40- super. One of the workers, Sarah, was really great at reading the aura report and was very helpful.</text>

<review>I was never so disappointed in a Physic reading - I wasted my time and my money. I was very anxious and needed answers. Instead, I received a whole sales pitch. I had so many questions but didn't get any answers because my whole reading was the Physic Reader Hillary's suggestions of what book I should read or what seminar I should attend. She wasn't the one I wanted answers from, I was expecting answers from my guides or higher-self. I was anxious before my reading and way more after my session.< /review>< Pics>

I drive by this place all the time and was excited to finally stop by. Instantly disappointed! Poor selection of crystals, only a few sad tumbled stones. Poor selection of tarot cards. And a bunch of cheap China-made trinkets. Just got a touristy vibe from the place.< /review>

This place is ok. The pool is supposed to be heated but it never is. We always joke that they mean it's heated by the sun. On days when it should be heated it's freezing. They always change how you check into the pool. They're supposed to have people to check you in on the weekends and nobody is there. The people they do hire are not from within the community. Security guards walk around with like bulletproof vests and make you feel like the community isn't safe. This past weekend we ha guest that we took and there were other families there with small children and you could smell weed. It smelled like someone had been smoking in the parking lot and even maybe inside the pool area. After we left we were told that a fight almost broke out because someone threw a ball and hit a small child and the mom told them to be careful and the person got all pissed and swearing. People always get rowdy in the pool and throw balls without consideration of who's around. Two weeks ago there were people drinking alcohol in the pool out of red solo cups. This place used to be really nice and quiet but lately it feels more like a public community pool. What's the point of paying hoa if this is the community atmosphere they're allowing< /Review>

I love GUESS Factory they always have clothes that I like and of very good quality and they have discounts all the time, the workers are always on the lookout for customers and I like that. Guess Factory have all kinds of clothing accessories such as glasses, belts, bags, jackets, shoes, t-shirts, pants, shorts and much more.</text>

<Text>Although their items were somewhat limited I still found a lot of really cute things. I’m of average stature for a woman, 5’5 with a slim/athletic build and their clothes and jeans fit so nice! The girls in the store were so helpful and asked if I needed other sizes while trying stuff on in the fitting rooms! I am happy after leaving here. Also, my husband bought a jacket from here and it runs small so you have to get a size or two bigger. But it’s a great jacket regardless, one of his favorites. BTW they close at 8:00 every night expect for Sunday they close at 7. The girl helping me said she can’t change the store hours that are posted online (it’s not her who posted it) overall good experience.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

My friend who worked there was   fired for letting school students earn extra credits..at no cost to the guess company. I think that's really wrong.. please do not buy clothing from guess stores.. what if it was your chilled trying to further there education? Or you loosing your job that supports your children? Please boycott. These retailers. Guess company does not like to help students get a future.... so please all you hard working family's who have children in school stop buying clothes from any guess store...I beg you help shut this kind of retailer down.. this should not be a practice applied in america.they should want to help school kids get their extra credits period...<//text>

<Review>What kind of training does guess have that they give there workers apparently is working to be co worker acusing people of stealing without proof she made us come back into the store after we where leaving as pass the embarrassing moment that we stole a pair of glasses that were lost and we told her to call the cops so they could check us and she didn’t want to and then we called the cops and when the cop got here she didn’t want to talk to the cop is that the training her name is Stephanie and the sale person 250067<//Review>< pics>

<Review>The prices and the service are sufficient for the food quality. This is the spot for all special occasions or a night out of fine dining, unpretentious and eloquent. When quality Italian cuisine and hospitality are required, one can easily become a "go-to" restaurant.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
The first thing that came to mind was Jean-Ralphio (Parks n Rec) when I heard "Bel Bacio." But truthfully, I just wanted to find a cafe in downtown San Jose that looked nice and had strong wi-fi (preferably a place I hadn't been to before).

Well, my first impression of Bel Bacio was that it was kinda magical. This was because  Bel Bacio is located in Little Italy (a magical little strip that isn't as interesting as Little Italy in San Diego, but is still special in its own way). Thankfully, there's a good amount of 2-hr (coin) street parking across from Bel Bacio.

Bel Bacio is pretty on the inside, and the employees were both warm and helpful.

I got to try their Nutellino (which is basically an espresso shot with a lot of Nutella and creme). Yup. It was marvelous.

This is a great place to study at not only because it's pretty and quiet but also because the seats are pretty comfy.

Note: They also sell food items like panini's here as well as gelato!<//Review>

This is a lovely little gem in little Italy. It is beautiful inside with lots of art. The owners spend a lot of time here and are warm and welcoming. The assortment of beverages and food after are all very tasty. This is a very clean coffee shop. It doesn't often get too busy during the day so a good place to get a little work done. Great for a coffee date. This place is a definite place to check out in the downtown area.</Text>

My favorite cafe in downtown San Jose. It's small, very cozy, with a flair that's closer to a living room than to a hectic coffee place, but that's what I love about it. The coffee is great, the paninis tasty and both the staff and owners are amazing.

If you've got a sweet tooth, check out the almond-marzipan sweets!<//review>

Very comfortable, small coffee shop. The vibe here made me feel right at home. So nice, I'm planning to take my wife here just for the experience and of course the coffee. I really hope little Italy can survive the tech transformation in the area of San Jose.< /Review>

This was my first time there and it was during the Italian Festival.   A hot day and a need for something iced and delicious.   So my friend and I took two coffee breaks and enjoyed some delicious iced coffee.   I also tried the iced mocha and was amazed that the chocolate was dark and unsweetened.   I loved it.   Didn't know that this place was there, but now that I do, I will definitely go back!< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I met the owners selling their coffee and treats at an event and they suggested I stop by their café to check it out. So I did, on a Saturday afternoon. Bel Bacio is in a cute building, in the San Jose Little Italy area. There are tables in every nook and outside seating available too.

The barista was very nice and made a few suggestions for dessert. We ordered the spumoni, affogato and a few desserts. All was delicious. The affogato was a little on the small side though.
Will definitely visit again.< /text><UserId.>106549331607883773794<//UserId.><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808fcca1d2a217d9:0x542d59d763f2a005<//Gmap_id><Name>Megan Allan<//Name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Time>1580309973403<//Time></record>

Angel made our coffee and he was nothing less than professional.  The ambiance was priceless.  We walked in 30 minutes before closing and the timing could not have been more perfect.  I visited Italy a few years back; yet today, for just that little moment, it was as if I'd never left!<//review>

Amazing little cafe, super surreal setting in a tiny home. Delicious authentic drinks made with italian coffee beans roasted in san Diego. Pictured are a macchiato and a shakerato. Quote from my girlfriend, "I feel like I'm in europe."< /text>

<text>The cookies and the coffee are absolutely fabulous. They taste great. The cookies have that better than home made taste, rich, buttery, delicious. Original flavors too. I recommend the almond and apricot cookies. They have a round chocolate shortbread which is not too sweet, perfect with a creamy latte.

Coffee is served in Italian (plus) sizes, so their largest one is smaller than a small Starbucks. Good flavor, beans definitely not burnt. The setting is nice too, very pleasant and cozy.

4 stars instead of 5 because they should have two people working there. We came in one morning and to get our cookies and coffee it took 26minutes. We know exactly because we put 30m on the parking meter and there were 4m left when we came back. That's too long for coffee, I don't think we would come during the week before work but for the weekend to enjoy la dolce vita, it's perfect.<//text><UserId.>117004583986857737457</UserId.>< rate>

I love finding unique coffee houses and Bel Bacio is my favorite. Great coffee drinks, especially the affogato (gelato and espresso) and nice pastries and snacks. Living room lounge and nice outdoor seating too. Just relaxing and nice to get away from the standard coffee places.</text>

Classy! loved the variation in types of coffee drinks!
The place has nice warm home setting. It is not big enough for a large group, but perfect to hangout with your best friend, date or just by yourself (take a book to read). This place is a must try.
Me being a coffee lover, absolutely loved "Shakerato".</review>

< Review>
Lovely little coffee cafe! Not very big, most inside tables are for two people, there are a couple tables outside for four. I didn't try any food from the menu, but did get an iced coffee called a Shakarino (sp?). It's two expresso shots and simple syrup shaken up in a martini mixer. Then poured into a cup with foam. I had mine over ice so it was super cold. Delicious!
Parking is limited to street parking, and that is usually taken. Expect a walk to get there.</Review>

Warm, intimate cafe in San Jose's Little Italy, on the edge of downtown, located in a renovated old house from the turn of the 20th century. I really enjoy a coffee on their porch.< /text>

1. The espresso was anything but. Apparently this barista either has no idea how to make a real one, or didn't pay attention care, but it was a completely watered down coffee, nowhere near an espresso.
2. One of the nutela filled pastries was heated. Problem was, it was over-heated so much, that the filling got burned up and lost it's consistency.
3. When we needed napkins, none could be found. Our table and all those we looked at, had empty napkin containers. So had to go ask the waitress.

Now maybe this is all a fluke - I would try again since they did use to be much better than this. But hope this is not what the new normal is there.

Past review: Top quality espresso and nice Italian pastries.</text><Rating>2< /Rating><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

Stumbled across this cute Italian coffee house on our trip to San Jose.  The coffee shop is in Little Italy in a house. Owner is very friendly. We order one of the specialty drinks, the Cadomocaccino which has cardamom and dark chocolate, I loved the drink and it was nice to sit in this cute house and enjoy the atmosphere. I'm gkad I got to stumble on this during my breif stay in San Jose.< /review>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Updating my review because I recently ordered an iced mocha and it was almost just like my first one! Only thing they forgot was the whipped cream on top.

Ordered a Fagotto (a chocolate+custard-filled sugary croissant, which is AWESOME). I asked for it warmed up and, unfortunately, they heated it up in the microwave (-1 points). Gotta toaster oven that badboy! Either way, this is a badass dessert. Love the subtle hint of custard in the filling to compliment the rich chocolate syrup.

Ate the fagotto with a side of the PISTACHIO GELATO. Match made in heaven. It was so good! They need to put more fresh salted pistachios in the gelato, though! I only got like 3 nuts total. I wish I had gotten 30 nuts.

I think I let a few poor experiences resulted in my previously bad review. Overall, though, this place is on point!<//review>< pics>

<review>By far, my favorite Mexican restaurants are always the dives, the holes in the wall, the underestimated, unpolished gems.

At Tia Juanita's in Atascadero, the service is friendly. The portions are huge. The menu is diverse and varied with vegetarian options. The food, while not the best I have ever eaten, is tasty and fresh. It took about 20 minutes for us to get our order. You could hear meat sizzling in the kitchen and smell the tantalizing aromas of food on the grill. They clearly cook it to order.

My husband ordered a burrito that was bigger than his head and probably weighed about 3 pounds. I ordered 3 tacos and could only eat 2 of them. Chips and salsa are complimentary and homemade.

The reason this place lost a star was for the level of cleanliness. Please keep the pink booths, the incongruous decor (pictures of Italy and France in a Mexican restaurant? Sure!) and the dingy lighting... it adds to the ambience! But the grease and dust has fused together on the blinds and other decor, creating a thing that is almost alive in its own right. This has got to go. Spray some bleach in the corners and let it do its work on the black film that has collected there.

Restaurants are a lot of work. Anyone who loves food knows this. But we also know that first impressions of the area in front of the counter really make people wonder what's behind it.

All this with love, friends. I will be back, but with hopes that a little cleaning will have been done.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoBdxnnwwFsSgF_vEC31ynYExTPO5LmHnCXZFj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

<name>David Cantu< /name><Review>It's now under new ownership and is now called "Suzy's". Excellent, authentic Mexican food. She has a menu but will put together anything you want within reason. Suzy is at the helm so the reason is clear why her food is great. Small dine in with outdoor seating in back or you can order to go. Best tasting spot around. Try it!</Review><time>1576209826084<//time>< Pics>

<Text>I think this is the best Mexican food in North county. Great flavor and absolutely delicious food! Love the salsa tray with the chips. Serving sizes are ridiculously big and the prices are very reasonable. It looks like a hole in the wall when you first drive by but trust me you will love this place< /Text>< Pics>

By far the worst mexican restaurant I have eaten at! Rice and beans were not even warm on my husband's plate or mine. Worst chili relleno and taco too! We drove from Paso Robles to try and definitely regret it.
The only thing we agreed was good was salsa.<//Review>

<text>Glad we stopped here and supported a family business on our drive down to SB from the Bay. Food was really good and staff was nice. Overall great vibe and way better than supporting big corporations nearby. Will be stopping at this place whenever we need food on the drive up or down from the Bay< /text>< Pictures>

Try the full nachos with meat. Get it to go since there will be leftovers. You can't even close the container!<//Text>< pics>

I went back and got just a regular carne asada burrito. The burritos are huge and well priced for what you get. It tasted just as good, if not better, than Garcia's. Their salsa isn't quite as good. But would recommend.<//text>< pics>

Tia Juanita’s is a nice little local Mexican Fast Food restaurant with a friendly staff and cooks who know their Mexican Food! The burritos are filling and the chili verde is oh so tasty. This is a very good stop for the travelers as it is easy off and easy on in all directions at the San Anselmo ramp. A good choice and a nice alternative to a chain hamburger. You almost have to know Tia’s is here it could be easy to drive by. So Give it a try and enjoy another little tidbit of our local fun here in Atascadero. Oh Yes, I love the Mural on the wall inside.< /review>

< review>
I was looking forward to trying Tia Juanita's. We live close and I had heard good things. My family was all together, so we ordered a variety of meals. Various burritos: carne asada, al pastor, fajita; combo plates: chile relleno, cheese enchilada; chicken enchiladas. I'm sad to say the rice was pasty and flavorless, the chicken looked and tasted like it had been cooked and reheated several times, the chips looked and tasted like mixture of various store bought chips, some red, some fried, some Fritos, some unknown origin. I've had better canned salsa. Then to top off the whole thing, when we picked up our order, someone else's leftovers were given to us instead of the chicken enchiladas and we had to go back and have them remade. Yes, that was the rubbery, reheated chicken. At least they threw in an extra enchilada for giving us someone else's leftovers. I'm sad to say, "I was very disappointed!"< /review>

Extremely disappointed. Almost no meat in my burrito. I asked for HOT salsa and it taste like Pico de gallo. The place needs a huge face lift. Looks like it is falling apart inside</Text>

<Text>This place is nice to have amazing indoor water view and very spacious outdoor tent with live music on Sunday brunch day. Food was great. Service was great and quick. The only thing I would say for me making reservations was of no point. We still have to wait and did not get the seating that I requested. One table was empty indoor with water view and they end up giving to people who did not had reservations and might be waiting prior to us. So I would say May be walk in us better.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDa1RBw13xM-jq2zj42O6_8YDMA9WEqLDz4c_r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCkcKhLxt_tlyZ6IoEJKwJ_qLzwgFh-B8ynX7e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2ovbwE_ZCCqf5fbLvn_31UMYyVLONlHHkPQ2o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><user>101333512373277172426<//user>< Rating>

We were in town from Texas and my niece chose this place for us.
We asked for water front seating, and were seated in JC’s section! Talk about an great, attentive and entertaining service. He will be our server of choice everytime!

He is COVID safe, but still friendly and super helpful! If we would have had another server the entire experience would not have been what I was hoping for. Thanks so much JC for EVERYTHING! We love you and we will be back in March with the whole Family!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN_HDEXTiUUNYNZnoYFmVYAA0eDO1YH5Nt9F1Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIr4pIRx_I0AXW-8pjxqiiTfEKHbhiA0klZePo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPICbbFovmQaupU0-iMr7dNitvwIWFHYxBHU-X0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNEuAt-h_O0bcNgFXMtCTlDK7XjDUrS1G-QBje=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1623962517552, 'text': 'We are happy to hear about your experience!

<Text>I hate this place the service is horrible but nice and polite. They don’t have clean dishes glass or plates. The food is eatable at best. Service visit not frequently, kept on brining our main course as appetizer for one person early twice. I strongly suggest not going here!</Text>< name>

<text>What a disappointment.. Where do I begin. I used to frequent Sol on weekly basis prior to the pandemic and loved the ambiance on the patio. So many birthdays, graduations, and holidays alike spent there. The customer service was always top notch and view was unbeatable. When I was thinking where to plan for my bridal rehearsal, naturally Sol came up as no brainer.  Tonight I called in to make a reservation 2 months in advance to lock in a patio table for my BRIDAL PARTY of 5....and this is what I received. I first speak with the host and she informs me that no parties over 4 are allowed on the patio ?????? Umm, can you not just push two tables together or add an extra chair ?? I've worked in the hospitality industry in the past for years and never was it acceptable to immediately respond to a guest with an automatic NO. Rather lead as solution oriented..

Then I proceeded to talk with the Manager John and it got worse. John piggy-backed off the host and mentioned he will put in a "Request" for a table but "no guarantees". Mind you were calling in to make a small reservation for a bridal party of 5 in 2 months from now...

Thank you so much John for your "warm hospitality" and "strong customer service", it is very well received ! I'll be sure to spread the word about this enchanting experience to all my friends and beyond. Good luck< /text><username>S L< /username>< Time>

Food is decent and strong drinks. But be advised you might have to wait longer if going with larger groups. We had a reservation at 8pm which we got the table at 9.15pm. The hostess ignored us till the end. The service starts to not live upto the standard as you approach the closing time.

But don’t want to take credit from the food and drinks. Desserts could improve.</text>

This restaurant is obviously one of the coolest place to eat in the neighborhood. Always when I visit this place I am so happy. They manage their very high  level service and the topmost level of meals  they give. You no doubt will love this place. Warmly  recommended.<//Review>

Food is unimaginative . Beautiful view of water so 2 stars but food seemed bland . I had fish torta which was not enjoyable.  The Spanish rice had no flavor, chewy and greasy.  Too much sauce on the food too makes it soggy</Text>

Restaurant looked busy, many staff memebers but server was not on her A game. Ordered a drink when dinner arrived and didnt get it till after we finished dinner. Manager did comp one of our 4 margaritas we got without asking for it to be comped which was nice of them. A lot of food runners but wait staff looked understaffed. Food was ok my finance's tacos (pictured) were plain and not worth 17 dollars. Rice was dry and no flavor. Not worth the money, might give it a try again at another date in the distant future.< /Review>< rating>

A bit pricey but what do you expect from a nice restaurant on the harbor. The service was excellent. JC was our waiter, he took very good care of us. He deserves five stars.<//text>

<Text>What was the name of restaurant(s) that  were at this location before it was SOL?  For years I use to go and watch the Christmas boat parade from the grand viewing dining room. I’d like to do it again, this time Mexican fare  post all of  the COVID MALARKEY!  I just can’t for the life of me recall the restaurants prior name(s)?

I will preface this by saying I have only had great experiences at SOL before the incident I’m reviewing on... hence the 3 stars.
Throughout COVID, SOL has been great as they’ve stayed open with an awesome outdoor dining setup (lots of heaters, great ambiance, etc.) but since California reopened indoor dining, that has all gone away.
I made a reservation a week in advance for a party of 7 for my boyfriend’s birthday. We requested indoor seating because we had older people in our party who don’t do well in the cold - they told us they could not make a note in the system but that if we showed up early we should have no problem sitting indoors but if we absolutely have to sit outside there will be plenty of heaters.
We arrived 15 minutes early and were told we could not sit inside unless we wanted to wait an extra hour, no big deal. We decided to try and sit outside and the host told us we will be able to have plenty of heaters. The second we were seated we found out this wasn’t the case. Every party sitting outside was bundled up in blankets and we were only offered one (basically single person) heater. We asked to get at least one more and were told that was not possible even though I had been recently and almost every person in the party was able to have a heater. It took a very long time to even get a response about the heaters from the manager and ended up leaving because of the experience.
I had never been to SOL pre-COVID, so I’m not sure if this was a one-off experience, but normally the food, drinks, and service are excellent. Unfortunately, we will definitely be hesitant to return.</text>

<Review>To celebrate Mexican Independence Day, my wife and I decided to have Mexican food for dinner. Originally we were thinking about hitting one of the chain Mexican restaurants near us. But decided to go to Sol Mexican restaurant for this special occasion.

We’re familiar with the Sol establishment. We frequent the Playa Vista location and we love their food. Since we want to visit Balboa Island during the day, we decided to have dinner at the Newport location afterward.

The food here didn’t disappoint us. They are just as good the food as in the Playa Vista location. I always have their Mexican street for appetizer. This corn is delicious which’s full of flavor and grill taste.

For the main dishes, my wife had their quesadilla with chicken and I ordered their fish taco and Vampiro. The Taco Vampiro came with double tortilla stuffed with melted cheese, serrano chiles & scallions, with carne asada, guacamole & pico de gallo, chipotle sauce & cotixa. All these ingredients made the taco tasted fantastic. The fish taco was just as good. I devoured both tacos in no time.

During Covid-19, the restaurant has a large out door tent for outside seatings. All waiters wear masks and glove. All guests have to check in outside of the restaurant before been seated.

Parking is valet for $5.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnqg2nM-F_8F4QqGFi5IAiovQ814cOycPQ_3BY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3MR7QSl2lHglu6GckRmYoRJprxgZ4wDMyrgRB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfIQCJ9ehVJuur62ne5ipu9NXYWmcUIpUmPH_y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQAPy89n5ZMcgHG7QrIZ2tFQ_DVL_oBiMMB65T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs5RRXyPvSTYwuM1dz8FIA2KsErDFiR8skS5cM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxGQvytYfIheAbh1Fs_h2yiF0Jw7Xwv4h00Hne=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg3e72wHXASzvdmhCgsAwvdVT6eWuvKDhnhlg9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7He1hlvXi3NWmWwE3M6rDQNZDdgcvwsrf4wPK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6mfSmrCnrYoZ8pMfgp3B9Dx1eKawBrgP2vnbM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

< review>
This recent visit wasn't as good as my previous. Luis our Server was Awesome and took great care of our dinner party in celebration of my niece's 21st birthday. The food quality this visit definitely wasn't as I remember. I had the Shrimp Taquitos (starter) - El Jefe Tacos (Filet & Shrimp)  and a few Cervezas. The Taquitos were decent - I shared those with my 4 yr old son - He loved them - Although they were Ok to me ... Something was different about the El Jefe Tacos though - 1st I remember them being more expensive and thought it was due to the Filet Mignon and the Jumbo Prawns - This trip they appeared to be made with NY Strip and regular shrimp. Then the overall quality was just Ok - Steak was a bit chewy - Shrimp were slightly overcooked. The brews were of course Ice Cold as they should be but I had expectations of a visit as quality as my previous and was slightly disappointed ... Maybe next time will be better .<//review>

I love that they serve beans with the salsa a yummy greeting that kicks off the experience was able to get a table the first time I came but I recommend reservations especially with a big party to avoid a wait. The octopus was my favorite most memorable plate. The fish tacos are also very delicious. They have a super boujee margarita made with clase azul with costs like $30 too expensive for me but I think it’s a cool treat they offer for birthdays and special occasions. I have been here like 3x this month great spot.</Review>

Really good food. Their carne asada fajitas(that's not what they call them) were delicious and the meat was very tender. Definitely will be added to the rotation.</review>

Subpar Mexican food at its best. Lackluster margaritas. Mediocre entrees. Decent chips, salsa, and beans. Much better options in Orange County at this price point. I wouldn’t go out of your way searching for good Mexican food and land on this place.< /review>

<review>The staff lied numerous to my party while trying to enjoy a meal. I went to this restaurant for brunch on the weekend because I called and specifically asked if they had bottomless mimosas and was told they did ONLY to find out they didn’t when we were seated. Not happy to find this out once seated. The manger literally would not come to our table to speak to us about honoring this. We felt cheated and belittled. The manger was too good to speak to us. I have never been treated like this at a restaurant. I’ve had better service at Del taco< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
It is a bit pricey for Mexican food ($10 for guacamole), but absolutely worth the splurge! I’ve been 4 times and never been disappointed. The food is fresh and seasoned to perfection.

The black bean dip that comes with the chips is so delicious. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Street Taco. My fiancé ordered the Mango Chilé Salad and added chicken. He was a little sad because he thought the mango would be fresh, not dried. It was still delicious, but next time he orders it he will get it without the mango. We had plenty of food left over to take home for another meal.

If you have a cilantro sensitivity check the menu before deciding to eat here. Many of the dishes include cilantro that cannot be removed. My mom does not like cilantro and found the menu options limiting.

The location is ideal, many restaurants in the area claim to be water front, but are not. Sol actually is along the harbor. They have a covered patio or booths that are along the window that line the water.< /Review>

Went here last night for my birthday dinner. The Guac was amazing and the street tacos were some of the best meat Ive had.  It was tender and the flavors really blended well. I would go here again.  Nice atmosphere and the waiter was very attentive.<//Text>

I've heard this place is great under regular circumstances. Unfortunately, my first experience was extremely lackluster. High prices for food that wasn't anything special at all, small portions, and slow service.</text>

<review>Our take-out was missing an entree. Luckily, I checked my order before driving off, and  no apology was offered by Sol. Once home, we saw the portions for our soup were very small- less than half of a bowl per serving (ordered 2 portions).  Plus, the food tasted mediocre. Feel that our order was thrown together at last minute.
Very disappointed with this recent experience with Sol Mexican Cocina. My previous dining experiences were much better.< /review>< pictures>

<text>First time here and LOVED IT! Everything from the ambience, food and staff are first class. Have to give a big shout out to one of our waiters, JC. Super funny and personable going the extra mile to make sure we had a great experience. Highly recommend the carnitas plate dinner.< /text>< user_id>

<review>Never go to this restaurant on a Saturday night. They take in more business than they can handle plus which they work with every delivery platform which makes it impossible to get food in a timely manner. If you do decide to get food delivered from here, expect it to take at least an hour and a half.< /review>< Pics>

<time>1604189402077<//time><pictures>None< /pictures><Review>WILL NEVER GO BACK.  We called twice to make sure they had bottomless mimosas since it was not on the menu, we were told they did have them for $12. Once we arrived the waiter told us they don’t do bottomless but have a $3 mimosa deal, we were bummed since they lied to us over the phone but said ok because the $3 deal seemed decent. Then we get the check and it has $5 mimosas on it. We tell our waiter this was a mistake and he said he told us it was a $3-5 range for mimosas. He leaves and takes $10 off, after tax and the %18 gratuity. We we’re shocked. After this we asked to speak to a manger. We specifically said “oh $3 is a good deal so we can do that.” The manager never came to talk to us after 15 minutes so we sought him out. After speaking with him he gave us $35 off our $300+ check, again after our original check. Nowhere near the difference between 19 mimosas if they were $3, not $5 AND this “discount” was after our original amount with tax and %18 gratuity. Veryyyyy disappointed in the staff and management. They did not try to help us. They were extremely rude and fought us on everything they had previously told us. Why tell us you had bottomless mimosas TWICE when you don’t serve them? I’ve never heard of a “range” for pricing on OJ/champagne mimosas! Absolutely ridiculous. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Mediocre food for high prices too.</Review>< gmapID>

Can't decide which part of dinner was the best. Attentive service for our large party, good variety of food options, and drinks with homemade mixes made with fresh juice. Don't ignore the black bean dip and salsa - made fresh and the bean dip nice and warm. I had the beet and watermelon salad and the black bean and sweet potato tacos, followed by the salted caramel pudding for dessert. It was worth every calorie! Hope to be back next time I visit southern California!<//text>

<Review>The service was terrible! I guess my group didn’t look rich enough, because our waiter basically ignored our table, while giving plenty of attention to other tables around us.

The food was mediocre, fairly bland and with small portions. For the prices charged, I expect either very tasty or big portions.

With all the Mexican food options in the area, this is at the bottom of the list.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dce07532ac1e4d:0xe82f0fb0287bb775</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great service with a view of the boats/harbor. Niko was our server and he was amazing with his customer service, making us feel welcome for our first time, and making some great food recommendations. The happy hour is fairly priced and the food exceeds that.

The atmosphere is friendly, comfortable and welcoming. I was hoping to go back before we left but we’re short on time.

Highly recommended for authentic Mexican food.</review><user>106323003196963995055< /user>< Response>

My friend and I went out to sols for her birthday And the only reason they’re getting a one star Just because they’re frozen drinks tasted pretty good but the rest was horrible for a 118.00 dollar beans and rice  mean.My friend ordered the short ribs and they use the sauce to cover all the fat .The yams we cold dry patties that stuck to the roof of your mouth Not one thing we ate came hot .Then the bathroom were so nasty on the way out the door very disappointing dinner</Review>

<Review>They told us they have bottomless mimosas over the phone. They instead had a deal on them. Didn’t honor it. Super disappointed in the service. Management didn’t help at all with the problem we had with our server. Wouldn’t recommend going here since the staff wasn’t on the same page.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

What can I say, SOL is amazing. From there cocktails to food, hands down a must in you are in Newport Beach. Taco vampiro !! OMG you must trying it, with steak. I can’t put into works the flavor in the tacos. Next is there grilled shrimp tacos and breaded as well, all are insanely amazing. SOL’s chorizo and queso skillet is definite as well as there aqua chille and shrimp ceviche. The atmosphere at SOL tops it off, live music, beautiful outdoor views of the water and surrounding area, just amazing.</text>

<text>Best Mexican food in the area by far. The vampiro tacos are the best tacos I ever had and I very highly recommend them. It is right on the water with an amazing view of back bay and the port and It also has boat parking. Perfect place to throw any event because they have a back area on the water in the restaurant. The food has always been amazing and They have really good valets out front< /text>< time>

I recently booked a business dinner (30 people) at Sol Mexican Cocina and it was a huge it! Despite the reservation being a little short notice, the event staff and day-of staff were fantastic. Everyone enjoyed the food and the room that was booked for us was perfect. Thanks so much for facilitating a stress-free and special night!</review>

Good food , very flavorful. Service possibly depending on time was hit or miss, plus it was so dark we could not read the menu without the phone flashlight. We got there at 5:30pm on Taco Tuesday - a busy day for this place we were told. Still would recommend this. Their Hot Ceviche appetizer was fantastic and so were the margaritas. $3 street taco specials. What's not to like!< /review>

Food was amazing, very authentic with homemade sauces. Our waiter Niko was extraordinary. He gave great recommendations for items we typically would not order that were excellent. Highly recommend the sol guacamole, stuffed peppers, and the bread pudding.<//Review>

< Review>
Very rude waiter (Junior). He had a bad attitude about being asked about Calories in the skinny margarita- told us to ask a bartender. We were seated at a table. Did not bother to even refill our water once. Also recommended a $28 shrimp dish with 4 shrimp. No, he did not tell us that there were 4 shrimp. $7 shrimp y’all. There was no gold leaf decor for that price either. If you must go, eat the fancy queso f and leave.<//Review>

<review>My wife and I were exploring in the Newport and Balboa area and happened to find SOL restaurant.  We stopped in and were pleasantly surprised.  The food was very tasty and the service was excellent. They provided a black bean dip along with some tomatillo salsa, but the table also had a habanero salsa that was GREAT. It was not too spicy and went great with the street tacos I had. They were able to accommodate us even without a reservation. The only downside was the price, but given the location of the restaurant I guess I should expect a higher price for lunch. Be prepared to spend $50 (including tip) for lunch without alcohol. I would definitely recommend this eatery for lunch. I will try dinner very soon.</review>< Rating>

<text>Great location including valet parking. The food was good with an interesting twist to normal Mexican food standards. A busy nice place for good Mexican food. A little on the loud side but only because of it's popularity.  Service was very attentive and prompt.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Food was great, location is good, the view is wonderful, atmosphere was nice my only complaint is the service was a little slow but acceptable. We were a larger group and we expect food to take longer. But we went through the chips (their version of chips were fantastic) and salsa and they were slow to replenish them and drinks. Will we go again? Most likely.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>I came here for a date night with my lovely boyfriend and was not disappointed. We were seated on the patio which is covered at night and it was very peaceful compared to the inside of the restaurant. All of the food especially the guacamole was incredible. Our waitress Kendra was an absolute peach and so prompt. Worth every penny.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Love this restaurant but the service is awful. It’s takes forever for your server to come to your table to get your orders. Then you have to sit there forever for them to make your drinks and bring your food. Then you turn around and the servers are all standing around chit chatting for a good 5 to 10 minutes. That show that at the time that we go there which is around 9pm, the restaurant is not as busy for them to take forever. It’s really frustrating.< /review>

<Review>The Food tasted very bland which was very disappointing considering the prices, normally I don't complain about prices at restaurants but honestly with the prices they have here you'd expect better quality. Every beer they brought me was warm, so after 3 tries i gave up and just ordered water which ended up being warm tap water. The service was decent but thats the only positive thing i have to say about this place, but honestly the service wasn't good enough to make me want to go back for bland food and warm drinks. If you're really hungry and you're in the area I recommend you avoid this place, it will definitely fill your stomach but you'll leave completely unsatisfied and odds are you won't finish your food, neither me or my group of friends could finish our food just due to it tasting like paper towels. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion and that there could be people out there who enjoyed this place, however for me it just didn't appeal to my palate. I hope this review helps anyone who reads it. And with that I'm off, stay hungry my friends.</Review><username>Jack Jeckel<//username>< date>

For a vegetarian, there are a few options but nothing to brag about. Unfortunately, you need to examine your food carefully if you are pure vegetarian as it sometimes contains a little meat (been there, done that). 4 stars for the cool vibe.<//Review><user>109627147695560774794<//user>< time>

<Review>Sol provides a low key chill vibe to Newport Harbor. This is not your typical lunch truck Mexican food. I would deem it authentically progressive and is definitely true to taste. The portions could be larger and happy hour adds to the affordability factor. I'd deem this a definite date spot after a drive down PCH.

< Review>
Now, this is one that deserves the five stars! Great friendly and attentive service. Great management of a big, well decorated and roomy restaurant with a nice view. It is on the high end but prices are not extravagant for the quality of food you get. Very well made and tasty food. Aside from the octopus being a little overcooked, the soup itself was very tasty and the rest of the food was fantastic. You have to try the roasted corn on the cob as they bring it to you and cut it off the cob for you at your table. Definitely a must try place if you're in the area!< /Review>

This place has a very nice interior and the environment; the food is a little hit and miss. For a vegetarian, there are a few options but nothing to brag about. Unfortunately, you need to examine your food carefully if you are pure vegetarian as it sometimes contains a little meat (been there, done that). 4 stars for the cool vibe.<//text>

<Text>Sol has added some new brunch items! Yay! Including a vegetarian one. The La Vida Quinoa Bowl is perfect! Just wish it had beans, since their beans are delicious! You can order your bowl with seitan or eggs - or do what I did and order both! The bowl also comes with poblano chiles, caramelized onions, squash, Kale, quinoa, and barley, topped with salsa verde, avocado, and choice of fried egg or chipotle garlic seitan. My new favorite menu item! I'll see if they can substitute half beans for the quinoa mix!!</Text>< resp>

Sol provides a low key chill vibe to Newport Harbor. This is not your typical lunch truck Mexican food. I would deem it authentically progressive and is definitely true to taste. The portions could be larger and happy hour adds to the affordability factor. I'd deem this a definite date spot after a drive down PCH.

Enjoy</text>

Now, this is one that deserves the five stars! Great friendly and attentive service. Great management of a big, well decorated and roomy restaurant with a nice view. It is on the high end but prices are not extravagant for the quality of food you get. Very well made and tasty food. Aside from the octopus being a little overcooked, the soup itself was very tasty and the rest of the food was fantastic. You have to try the roasted corn on the cob as they bring it to you and cut it off the cob for you at your table. Definitely a must try place if you're in the area!</Review>

<review>The Food tasted very bland which was very disappointing considering the prices, normally I don't complain about prices at restaurants but honestly with the prices they have here you'd expect better quality. Every beer they brought me was warm, so after 3 tries i gave up and just ordered water which ended up being warm tap water. The service was decent but thats the only positive thing i have to say about this place, but honestly the service wasn't good enough to make me want to go back for bland food and warm drinks. If you're really hungry and you're in the area I recommend you avoid this place, it will definitely fill your stomach but you'll leave completely unsatisfied and odds are you won't finish your food, neither me or my group of friends could finish our food just due to it tasting like paper towels. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion and that there could be people out there who enjoyed this place, however for me it just didn't appeal to my palate. I hope this review helps anyone who reads it. And with that I'm off, stay hungry my friends.</review><rating>2<//rating><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce07532ac1e4d:0xe82f0fb0287bb775</Gmap_id>< user>

<user_name>Heidi Shurtz</user_name><text>Not sure how I haven't tried this place before. We stopped in around 7 on a Saturday night without reservations but got seated pretty quickly. The chips,salsa and bean dip is really good. We had the specialty margarita- passion fruit & guava and it was really good. The food was authentic and tasty. We will be back- maybe try to sit on the patio.<//text>< pictures>

I can definitely say that SOL Mexican Cocina is some of the best Mexican / Spanish food I've had from a restaurant in a pretty good long while I love just what everything about this place the ambiance is really good it's very show and they have a gorgeous view of the nearby Marina or dock whatever you want to call it The food definitely seems worth the price even if the menu seems a bit restrictive I appreciate it because whatever is on the menu is cooked very well with deep flavors I would say the only thing that would have been a little bit of a bump in the road is our waitress sing a little bit irritated with us but maybe she was having a bad day or something I don't know everyone else that worked there was definitely top shelf and very niceI would say if you want some good quality food in this area I would definitely check them out<//Review>

<Review>We had the naked guacamole. It tasted great. I give it a 9.I'd give it a10 if there was jalapeno in it. I give the black bean dip a 7, the red salsa a 4. I had the Mexico city taco and the Vampiro taco. I give the former a 6 and the latter a 9. We had the blond brownie "la Guerra" for dessert. I give it a 7. The service was excellent and our server was very friendly.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dce07532ac1e4d:0xe82f0fb0287bb775<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>OMG! Where do I begin? This place is one of my favorites! They have a great atmosphere inside and out. There's not a bad seat in this whole place! Their cocktails are definitely something to look forward to! Great chips and salsa and delicious guacamole!

So many dishes to choose from and you just can't go wrong!

I've been here over 30X and I still love and crave the good and drinks. Great for big group too or to just go by yourself for lunch. You can bring your dog on the patio as well.

Highly recommend this place</Text>< date>

I visited yesterday and the experience was mediocre. I was given chips and salsa and the server took the plate while I was eating. When I wanted to speak with a manager, it took longer than expected to speak with the person. The happy hour price of the margarita should be the same as the margarita that is not on happy hour in terms of size and quantity.</text>

<Review>Great food. Really interesting, and tasty. Prices in line with a Newport waterfront location, which means it comes across as pricey, particularly if you add alcohol. That doesn't disqualify it; but knowing it on the way in is helpful. I've been impressed with the food, and that's really the key here.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>107112867566393155809<//userid><resp>None<//resp><username>Tom Jewell</username><date>1510354055006<//date><gmapID>0x80dce07532ac1e4d:0xe82f0fb0287bb775</gmapID><rate>4< /rate></record>

I love the atmosphere. The fireplace in the center of the bar area gives it a special touch. Taco Tuesday has copious amounts of high quality tacos at discounted rates. Get there early because it gets packed quickly. If you mind standing and prefer to sit, then reservations on this day are helpful . The waiter I had last visit even made me a custom ginger ale soda which was one of the best I have had the pleasure to drink. A definite recommend.</Review>

Food was excellent. Prices not too bad for OC however we were a party of 25 and service sucked big time. We only saw our waitress 3 times (to order, bring out food and collect plates/check. She knew she was getting her tip anyway and she sure did show it. I would never go there again. We even had to keep asking different waiters/waitresses for water. What a waste of money especially since we were celebrating 2 birthdays!</text>

<review>Great way for my co-workers and I to end the work week and start our weekend at SOL Cucina!
The restaurant was buzzing with people and activities and the staff are friendly and attentive.  Our beautiful hostess, Kendra, was very sweet and patient as we gals chatted away and couldn't decide what to order.  The manager, Kevin, came by and gave us some recommendations and he was spot on.   Now, that's teamwork and service!
Our feast:
1. Bull Dog Margaritas - refreshing
2. Hot & Raw Ceviche- super fresh
3. Naked Guacamole and beet/sweet potato chips - tasty & healthy
4. Chicken Salad
5. Casa Noble teguilla with a chaser of Sangrita- savory
Yeah- you can say we can a good time!  Bonus- valet parking and a great view of boats, kayakers, sunset.  Can't wait to go back for round 2.</review>< date>

<text>Couldn't believe this place.  My sister in law had called several weeks in advance to make a reservation to celebrate my father-in-law's 61st birthday.  When we arrived, they turned us away claiming they had no such reservation.  Not only was the reservation made weeks before but twice earlier in the week we called to make some changes and make sure they could accommodate our particular circumstances.  My sister-in-law received a text message with the confirmation.  She showed this to the employees who blamed the issue on a change in their system.  After several minutes, they brought out the manager who also told us there was nothing he could do.  Didn't even offer to do anything about it.  Very unprofessional and honestly just surprising.  Any place that treats their customers this way obviously doesn't care about their reputation but I'm leaving this review so others don't have the same experience I did.< /text>< Pictures>

Fantastic dinner! Our food was delicious and had character.... this is not your typical "beans and rice" Mexican restaurant.  I loved the array of sauces, pepper relishes and dips.  It was easy for our family to customize their plate to suit their taste. The staff was prompt, courteous and working very hard to make us happy.... job well done!  Quality from start to finish!< /Review>

What a waste of money especially since we were celebrating 2 birthdays!<//Text>

Super busy on a Monday. Staff was very nice and accommodating once they were able to take our order. Smothered chicken burrito was excellent!<//review>

<review>Couldn't believe this place.  My sister in law had called several weeks in advance to make a reservation to celebrate my father-in-law's 61st birthday.  When we arrived, they turned us away claiming they had no such reservation.  Not only was the reservation made weeks before but twice earlier in the week we called to make some changes and make sure they could accommodate our particular circumstances.  My sister-in-law received a text message with the confirmation.  She showed this to the employees who blamed the issue on a change in their system.  After several minutes, they brought out the manager who also told us there was nothing he could do.  Didn't even offer to do anything about it.  Very unprofessional and honestly just surprising.  Any place that treats their customers this way obviously doesn't care about their reputation but I'm leaving this review so others don't have the same experience I did.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Delicious food with a great waterfront location! When it's busy the wait staff will not be able to get to you as quick as you like. Order water, drinks, and or chips and salsa the minute you get seated! Have your drink orders and apps orders ready when they come back with your water and chips. Be an efficient customer so you minimize having to goose neck around looking for wait staff.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Didn’t even get to eat here, but I don’t think I’ll even bother to try. They don’t seem to care about their customers. We made a reservation 3 weeks in advance for my dad’s birthday dinner, got confirmation from the restaurant. Even called the restaurant the night before to confirm again and make sure there was room for our 3 small children. However, upon arrival, the hostess claimed there was no reservation for our group of 13. We even showed them proof of our reservation and they claimed they changed booking systems and wouldn’t honor our reservation or try to make room for us. Totally ridiculous.< /text>< pictures>

The food is all fresh and tastes great.  Also the the margarita selection is amazing.  All made with fresh ingredients.  I love a spicy margarita so I ordered the pineapple Serrano and the spicy cucumber margaritas.  For food I kept it simple and ordered shrimp and poblano quesadillas and they did not disappoint.< /Review>

You can order your bowl with seitan or eggs - or do what I did and order both! The bowl also comes with poblano chiles, caramelized onions, squash, Kale, quinoa, and barley, topped with salsa verde, avocado, and choice of fried egg or chipotle garlic seitan. My new favorite menu item! I'll see if they can substitute half beans for the quinoa mix!!< /review>< Resp>

Came here twice for family birthdays. Good idea if people are willing to shell out the money for it. The first time we were seated in the back portion which had an outlook of the docks. Second time we were in the usually dining area. Wait staff have always been great. Really good cocktails and apps. The duck tacos are phenomenal. Very popular upscale restaurant, so I would recommend making a reservation</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Unfortunate experience today at this restaurant.   I asked the bald bartender (never caught his name) about the ingredients in a drink and his response was so dismissive and opinionated that I didn’t want to even dare ask anymore questions as his response made me feel so uncomfortable. Our drinks came and they were mediocre at best and when my fiancé suggested fresh squeezed juice would be worth the price the bartender was rude and somewhat demeaning. So not only was our drink not enjoyable but the service wasn’t either. The only thing I enjoyed about the restaurant was the location and the live music.</Text>< pics>

Been here a few times and.usually fairly good.  Yesterday, everything was off, with a bad batch of dipping salsa, so-so tacos and very bland rice.  It's never great, but the views and atmosphere usually make up for mediocre food. It's a toss up whether I'll return for the great location and.live with mediocre food.</text>

<gmap_id>0x80dce07532ac1e4d:0xe82f0fb0287bb775<//gmap_id><text>I have been here in the past and enjoyed their margaritas. I always thought they were one of the best in the area. My girlfriend and I decided to stop by for a couple, last night after happy hour. After waiting around for an empty seat, we settled for the bar. Ordered the usual "house margaritas" and they were not only weak AF but also very watered down. No lime taste and no kick at all. When I asked the bartender about them, he said it was the same formula they have used for years. I tried to argue and he said I must have ordered the "skinny" in the past. I don't order skinny margaritas, EVER. He insisted so I drank the watered down lemonade I was served. My girlfriend however made him serve her a margarita with lime juice instead of the garbage she was served. We also ordered some guacamole to go with our chips. This was also altered. Not pure avocado as it should be. Slimed down with tomato added to it. We didn't order anything else after that. The bartender had the audacity to ask me if I wanted another margarita. I laughed, and said no. Then we got the bill and he charged us for 3 margaritas instead of 2.  I will never again bother with this place. El Ranchito down the street makes them way better. Not posh like this place, but who cares?<//text>< resp>

Great view if you sit in the back! Gets a little hot cause some of your party is going to be in direct sunlight so open the windows.

Food is great! Got the ahogado and split it with a friend and was the perfect amount of food. Served with free chips, salsa, and bean dip.</Text>

Taco Tuesday - packed but delicious!  Of the three tacos I had - short rib, viper, and Cubano - I liked the viper the best by far. Of note are also the Mexican session ipa (delicious) and the street corn (a must get every time).</review>

<text>We went to SOL for the first time last night.  The food was wonderful.  One of the best things is that you can order one taco or a full meal.  Our waiter "Tony" really made our first time one to remember.  He joked with us and made good suggestions.  Next time we are going to try the "happy hour" from 3 - 6.  The bar looked friendly and fun.</text>< Pics>

Upscale restaurant. The food was actually quite impressive! Cool view of the marina. The dining area was very loud. The Bar area was even louder.

My date is now partially deaf from all the noise. Good tacos tho< /Review>

<review>This is eaisly one of the best casual dining spots in Newport Beach.  It is located right on the water and has a decent view of the harbor.  The food here is fantastic and I have yet to try something I didn't like.  In addition to the restaurant there is also a bar area with a few TV's.  Valet is complimentary and reservations are recommended.  Make sure to check serving sizes as some of the tacos are a bit small.  Prices are consummate with what you'd expect in NB.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dce07532ac1e4d:0xe82f0fb0287bb775< /gmapID></record>

The food was pretty good. The waiting staff was pretty good too. However, the hostesses screwed up on a surprise party and gave no effort to resolve that the lost a reservation regardless of showing e-confirmations. They lacked all sensitivity over the matter which is the two stars... Very poor taste left.</review>

Great view if you sit in the back! Gets a little hot cause some of your party is going to be in direct sunlight so open the windows.

Food is great! Got the ahogado and split it with a friend and was the perfect amount of food. Served with free chips, salsa, and bean dip.<//Review>

Food is delicious, I like the fact that they they're in their own lil twist to make it different. Our waitress was great! The atmosphere was loud and very dark, kinda hard to see what's in my food let alone take a pic without using your flash, Personally I like to be able to see my food and inspect it lol! Besides all the lil things it's a great place and can't wait to go again, maybe day time might be different.<//Text>

It is located right on the waterfront with view of the marina. Self parking is a bit scarce but they do have the option of valet parking as well.
The service was great, from the hostess all the was to the busser, everyone one is on point.
The food was delicious, it was too choice seafood, and the Mexican food is also well done, and with great presentation. That being said it is expensive food Mexican food, I have had cheaper food that tasted just as good.
The drink selection is great, heavily tequila based, specializing in Margaritas. Their speciality cocktails(Margaritas 90%) are all made with quality tequila and reasonably priced.
Overall it was a great experience< /text>

<Text>The food is usually good and I do like their salsa. Sometimes the service feels a little off, either hurried or some days lackadaisical. Last visit we had to move tables cause the one we were sat at was so loose it wobbled all over. Foods good but I think they need to tighten up their operations a bit.< /Text></record>

a wow offering of cocktails and epsecially the margaritas! Try the skinny and the mango one!

Food was delicious! and impressed with the service!

Decoration is nothing special but you can have nice views of the marina esp during dusk time! Reservation in advance is recommended.</review>

Hard to get a reservation but there is “free seating” at the bar. However if you wait for a table or a spot at the bar all of the sudden the spot will be “reserved” when clearly someone simply paid the bartender. Horrible service<//review>

< Review>
Let me start off by saying Sol used to be one of my favorite places to go to in Orange County.  The drinks were always strong, the food was consistently delicious, and the service was spot on... However, after tonight's dining experience I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.

Upon arriving the energy  was great and it wasn't even difficult to find a seat in the bar area. Unfortunately, that's as positive as it gets.

Our server Bianca took forever to acknowledge us. After she finally arrived at our table it took what I would consider to be an unreasonably long time to get our drink order to us.

By the time Bianca got our drinks to us our drinks were watered down indicating they had been sitting for a while. At $14.00 a drink you'd think you'd get your drink in a more timely manner.

Unfortunately, the food seemed to be a bit off as well. The Ceviche was fresh and tasty but lacked SALT (truth be told there wasn't very much fish either). The salads were flavourful and decent sized but the shrimps were about the size of a nickle.  On a  positive note the shrimp taquitos were delicious.

It literally took approximately 35 minutes after we finished our meal to get Bianca's attention and finally get our check. It took another 15 minutes for her to retrieve it so we could leave.

With so many available dining options in the area I'm surprised at how much Sol has taken for granted.< /Review>

Great restaurant was wonderful tacos and a lovely ambiance. However, they recently replaced my favorite mean, the Chicken Enchiladas, with one far less appealing. Wish they'd bring it back!<//review>

Food was good, service was the worst, no communication with the hostess and servicer. Waited 32 mins to get a glass of water and a server even we spoke to a server 5-6 mins waiting and was told she was not our server and would tell our server.

At the 23 min mark I went to find a hostess to ask for the manager and he came by 4.45 mins later. No apologies just he will send the server by. Another 4 mins went by as we grabbed our jackets to leave and they brought water.

The server was apologetic saying she didn't know we were there and wasn't told, even though she walked passed us 8-13 times with drinks and to go to the bar. The manager never came by to check on us to ensure we were ok and if the food was good as I had addressed him with the poor service.

Having been in the industry for up to my late 20s as server, bartender, supervisor, manager I know the full service cycle and expected wait times. From fast food, casual, fine dining, from restaurant chains to 5 star resorts and 5 diamond rated restaurants. The place will be going down hill due to the management.< /review>

<review>Went for a cousin's bday party. The party members were seated at a non-handicap friendly spot. The staff politely swooped our disabled guest out of her wheel chair and flew down a flight of stairs with grace.

I normally enjoy half-hearted birthday songs at restraraunts. Not so here. Show stopping birthday song. Highly recommend.

Be prepared to have a man steal the show with a beautiful voice holding a glorious set of notes in your honor.

Food 👌👍 but seemed a little pricey.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Food was fresh and good. A little pricy but understandable due to waterfront location and nice decor. Unfortunately, they lost a couple stars from me due to: 1. The waiter charging me $2.50 for soda water from the tap, and 2. We got the churro dessert (it was delicious) which came with a scoop of ice cream but what we got was more like a bottle cap's worth. We asked for a little more ice cream and that found its way on to our bill too. Overall, really nice date night, but it's always annoying when you're paying that kind of money for food and get nickeled and dimed where you shouldn't.<//review>

Their veggie quesadilla is probably the best I have ever had. I love the sauce they use, the bean dip and salsa for appetizers, and their margs are to die for. Love the ambiance too. Go-to spot for my boyfriend and I!< /Review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>I love SOL. I have been to multiple SOL locations so I already knew I would like the food. The food and drinks are a little expensive, but everything is really good and worth the price, in my opinion.

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of one time when my friends and I went and it was PACKED. We asked how long the wait was and the hostess was kind of indifferent about us being there and told us the bar is opening seating and we can go check if there are seats "I guess."

Worse costumer service ever. The manager Kevin was so rude to our party when we asked why our reservations were not going to be accommodated. We made reservations and they couldn't even sit us at the time we reserved. If I would of known then I would had gone somewhere else for dinner instead of waiting forever to see if they could even sit us. Kevin was arrogant and rude.</Text>

Outstanding ceviches and amazing taco selections.  We've tried them all, including the surprising vegetarian option.  This is Mexican cuisine ... not Mexican "food."  Prepare to be enchanted.  The chef is a superstar.</text>

We went to Sol in Newport Beach for the first time this week. The food was amazing and varied infused with true Baha flavors. Unfortunately the margarita's were very disappointing. We love a good Cadillac margarita and have found a number of them around town. The Cadillac's we were served at Sol were watered down and didn't seem to have any tequilla in them. We know a good margarita when we have one so this was very disappointing. At $13.00 for a 12 oz glass we felt ripped off. If they can improve on their drinks we will definitely go back or just order a beer instead.</Text>

Mixed reviews here.  Nice location, harbor views.  Food would be mostly good if price was appropriate to flavor.  I got two tacos which was like 16 bucks which would of been good 5 ish dollar tacos. (Still expensive by many standards).  There's enough craft taco places out there that you need to deliver if your going at that price point.  They do make a solid, and large, michelada though.</Text>

I was there for drinks few weeks ago and I asked for a strawberry margarita and the Mexican bartenders dint know how to blended
They serve me a frozen lemon from a machine margarita with some strawberry on the button
When I asked to chance the drink they told me no I can't and they charge extremely expensive serve margaritas in small cups not good at all the 2 bartenders were very rude. I talk to the. Restaurant manager he did not have any good solution for me  he is also very rude I will never go to this place ever again !!!<//text>

The pricing is very decent for this area actually; some items can be pricey, like the $11 'El Jefe' Taco, but that's also because it has Filet Mignon and Shrimp in it, and is the best damn taco I've ever had in my life.

It's like you walked into a Lisa Vanderpump reality restaurant trash in LA were employees think they are the next big anything so they dont give a S*** they are only there to look for a sugar anything! Ceviche came out warm and smelled like catfood! It's sad that they bring out a roasted corn and cut it in front of you like if that's suppose to be impressive that's one level close to the corn at a cheap OC fair.. The taco meat had no marinated flavor looks pretty but tastes like plastic.Dont be fooled by the good location just keep going south and go to the Winery instead for real good, service & view.< /Review><username>Olivia Rose King<//username><response>None< /response><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>About the most overpriced below average food I've ever eaten. I'll never go back. Drinks are a straight out rip off.

<text>This place was disgusting and it is so fake baja food they don't even know what they are talking about. Then when our food got to the table I was like what is that because it didn't even look good enough to eat. So over all they don't even know what is baja food so they should just stop what they are doing. If you want real baja tacos go to Tacos El Gordo.<//text><username>Chucky Flores< /username><userid>114983882997541596091</userid>< resp>

<text>I'm giving it 2 stars for the view, right by the marina. The menu is ok, but come on, Newport Beach is not the place to get Mexican. They throw cotija cheese on everything, don't get me wrong, I love cotija, but it doesn't make your dish gourmet. Over priced Birria, birria is a cheap dish to make, the cut off beef isn't premium. I would say go elsewhere for authentic good Mexican food, go here if you want to impress someone or have dinner while looking at boats.</text><name>DTM driven<//name><user_id>109616578744430498307</user_id></record></dataset><record>

I have wanted to visit this restaurant for quite some time and I finally did today for lunch.  The staff and food are excellent.  The manager, Mario, was extremely professional and accommodating.  I had two of the signature tacos, the Vampiro and the fish taco, both were great.  I started with the guacamole sol and the ceviche and had a blackberry-ginger margarita...I would order all of these again and I look forward to returning.</review>

We came here for a Mother's Day brunch before, and came back for dinner tonight. It was definitely worth the second visit. I couldn't remember what I got the first time, but I remember liking it. Tonight, I tried something I wouldn't normally order for a little variety -- the Chipotle shrimp poblano quesadillas... It was fantastic... Just the right amount of spice. I only wish I had known it has onions, next time I'll ask them to hold onto them.< /Review>

The food is great but the service was slow. Not sure i would recommend it if you need to get out in a reasonable time. We booked the patio but was told   ON ARRIVAL that there was a private party therefore no seats there. So two weeks ago you didn't know that???</review>

SOL and Cadillac Margaritas along with the spicy ceviche were very good, unfortunately the bar service was not what I would have expected, somewhat dishonest.</Text>

The restaurant is nicely furnished and rather nice. Our waitress was really friendly and so was the hostess when we walked in. The food is a bit pricy, but worth it. The chips they served us with were really big but the guac was a very expensive appetizer we weren't sure we should invest in. The duck taco was really tasty, but only really made two tacos and not three like the menu claimed. My mother's used thd extra tortilla because her taco was pretty large and well stuffed. The torta that my sister ordered was rather large and very tasty. Overall a very nice experience with good food. The only thing that ruined our late brunch was a very loud and rowdy group next to the bar which was being particularly vulgar.< /Review>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>5 stars for the service. Everybody  was polite and respectful.  My girlfriend and i were visiting so cal and our friends from OC wanted us to try this place.

But personally i did not care for the food, they try to make mexican dishes into something they are not. Example in MY opinion a taco is only suppose to have meat, onions, salsa, and cilantro and should run no more than 1.25. Here at SOL they do not follow that. Me and my girlfriend  paid 48$ for 2 beers 1 taco 1 burrito.....  all this while our friends were raving how this place is one of the best Mexican restaurants arounds. But personally the only thing Mexican about it is decor and beer. Overall great service but two words "no manchen"</Text>< pics>

We had crab benedicto and the egg was cooked not poached. The souflee was very good. The server didn't offer coffee which was weird for brunch. They didnt clear the table of excessive placings when we were seated. If you like strong drinks, they serve them here.

This was our honeymoon night out and it was RUINED BY THE SOL "MANAGER".... hope the bad review was worth 21$ of awful food.... HORRIBLE AWFUL MANAGER!!!!

<text>Came for Sunday Brunch and ended up getting the OC Restaurant Week lunch! I reserved via open table and requested a table out in the back patio because we were entertaining friends from out of town. and they certainly delivered! it was a gorgeous Sunday and we had a beautiful view of the marina with the sun beaming down. it was perfect!  check in on yelp and you get a $5 margarita! although.....i do believe its a smaller size of their regular one as i saw some people at another table with much bigger margaritas than us. either way, it was still DELISH!

the complimentary chips and salsa is absolutely.....addicting! they dont give you the plain ol tortillas chips. they're like huge tortillas they bake (or fried, but i'll just keep telling myself its baked to make myself feel better about eating them).the only the thing is you have to break them into actual dippable pieces. not only do they give you salsa but they also give you beans to dip your chips. omg. soo good....i'm drooling just thinking about it.

anyway, we initially came here for the brunch options but it was the last day of OC Restaurant Week so we decided to just order off the lunch menu for $15. for the 1st course, i had a goat cheese side salad and for the entree, i had the 3 taco sampler, one each of the meexcal chicken, carnitas and carne asada and for my side option, i went with the quinoa salad. out of everything i had, i think the quinoa salad was my favorite! lol not saying everything else sucked, because it didnt. the tacos were good and the side salad was good but the quinoa salad to me was outstanding. but honestly, it was the chips and salad that won me over and will come back again for more!

(Translated by Google) Maxican food at New Port beach, Irvine California.
I really like Mexican food especially tacos, but here you get special tacos, delicious and for those of us from Indonesia, you definitely like Maxico-style chili and served with rice.
Unfortunately for our booking we were unable to full it so I waited 30 minutes to get a seat.

Maxican food di New Port beach, Irvine California.
Saya sangat suka makanan Mexico terutama Taco, namun disini anda mendapatkan Taco yg istimewa ,enak dan bagi kita yg dari Indonesia pasti suka sambel ala Maxico dan disajikan pula dengan nasi.
Sayang untuk booking kita tidak bisa saking penuhnya saya menunggu 30 menit untuk bisa mendapatkan tempat duduk.<//text>
