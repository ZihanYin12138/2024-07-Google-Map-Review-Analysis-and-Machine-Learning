The day we went, which was a holiday the supplies were a bit depleted.

If you're looking for auto parts or supplies to keep your car up this is a good place to shop.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1536680426348, 'text': "Hello Gary, thank you for the great feedback!

<text>Just wanted to raise some recognition for the quality service I received from Isaac at the San Luis Obispo (SLO) Autozone. Not only did he help out with installing some new windshield wipers, but he also shed light on some cool hikes in the area. Thanks so much Issac! My windshield is crystal clear and I know where I'll be hiking next. If you're in SLO, I highly recommend this invaluable pit stop before heading to your next destination. Thanks, Isaac!</text>< user_name>

Once again I had a pleasant experience with exceptional service from someone at this Autozone location.  Today Angel who is a newer manager there helped me get the right replacement windshield wipers for my CRV.  Not only did he do that but he offered and I gladly accepted the installation of said wipers.  Great guy and great service!</Text>

Pretty average Autozone. Staff is usually helpful. Has decent stock on hand for the vehicles I've needed parts for which has been quite a few times over the years. Easy access from Higuera Street.</Review>

Have everything auto related you would expect. Nothing special though.  Parking lot a bit small. Employees polite and respectful, somewhat knowledgeable enough to help with most things. Pretty clean shop, parking lot has garbage all over ground though,  not prettiest store I've been to.< /review>

I have never been more blown away by the lack of knowledge or service. I go here for cheap parts. Forget any kind of knowledge or advice.

God I wish I could remember the one guy who actually knew what he was talking about. Everyone else there just gives you a blank look when you ask for anything more technical than a windshield wiper blade. Fricking hopeless service. I've been told to wait for half an hour TWICE now becuase some dude was out in the parking lot changing a battery. WHY!? is this place still in buisness?? Step up your game, come on.< /text>

<text>Such a CLEAN FULL STOCKED store. They never run out of anything and always get items for you if they do not have them. The bathroom is the cleanest bathroom I have ever seen in a gas station. Such good customer service and they renovated the inside and outside! Looks so clean and nice. Gas prices are always cheap here and they even carry E85!!

<review>i have been going to this particular gas station for the last 5 years and i absolutely love the service. The manager is extremely helpful and has great customer service along with the rest of the employees. The store is always clean from the inside to the outside. I have never seen a cleaner gas station then this one. I love this gas station since it has enough space for me to fill up my RV and it is not congested at all.</review><Time>1510644137002< /Time>< gmapID>

Because it is a Valero Gas Station that is a plus but it is one of more poorly unkept when it comes to servicing their fuel pumps and the pump LCD displays. I have been forced to change pumps of flat give up in frustration on several fuel stops  because the pump displays didn’t work or entering ATM CCard info would not complete. It’s much better gas than AM/PM. Also this station does not have a self service car wash.</Review>

Unfortunately due to Mentone being run by the county - the site being a grandfathered site (Setbacks with property lines) and no sewer system having a self service car wash is a little difficult.\n\nHope to see you again,\nAlex P.'}</Resp>

Update: this original review was 2yrs ago. I'm guessing they have new management or ownership because not only have the issues mentioned below been resolved, but the pump machines are new and function reliably, there are new digital price signs for the station, and it's been painted and refreshed inside and out. The air and water work, but the valve for air is bent and difficult to accurately connect. If you're buying gas, they'll turn on the air for free. The gas prices are a little higher than other stations on average according to GasBuddy, but not enough to cause me to drive elsewhere since it's close to my house and it's now a great servicing station.
------------------------
Decent gas, but horrible services and function. Squeegees are usually broken, random pumps malfunction or won't display properly forcing going inside to pay or moving to different pump. Staff is friendly but evidently not interested in fixing these problems because they're reported often.</Text>

< Review>
they like to overcharge on diffrent items inside the store ,they say manufacture pre pricing the item at high price and the item has no pre price on it. Item is priced 20 cents higher than most locations around . The owners are new and they don't realize that charging high prices is running regular customers off . thats not good good customer service especialy loosing customers infavor of making extra money per item.  the owners are nice and hope they will rethink how they price items in the future.<//Review>

<Review>I stopped by at around 7pm on a Saturday. Traffic there was surprisingly brisk, but not the safe kind. A person had parked their car smack dab in the middle of the pass lane and instead of moving her car to a side, she motioned for me to back up and go around from the opposite direction. The station wasn't lit adequately. The air gauge was broken. Don't stop there.< /Review><date>1613337140585</date>< Name>

<text>I had been to this place many times. Really impressed by the quality of food and flavor. Good South Indian vegetarian food. Food always tastes fresh. The best part is very reasonable prices including the recently started Indian curries . Their bakery offerings are top notch including cake slices, cookies and custom made cakes.  This place gets very busy at times. Still they maintain their quality and accurate order preparation . All the people working there are very friendly and attentive.  They were very pleasant to chat with. I was impressed with the way they handled large number of takeout orders and walk in orders during the pandemic. Highly recommend this place for any one craving for indian food.</text>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I went into here on October 21st, looked around and ended up buying a package of chocolate chip cookies around 2pm. Afterwards I left and when I went to eat the cookies, guess what I found? Hair. Not just in one cookie, but in 3 cookies. Disgusted, I went back that night around 7pm. I waited over 15 min in line to get to the front counter, when I asked for the manager the cashier looked right at her and then back at me and lied to my face that she wasn't there. I remained calm and asked for a refund. He then lied to me again telling me that he gave me a refund and if I don't see it then call back in a couple days. I left the cookies there with him, but I made sure to take pictures ahead of time.
Update: I went in again to ask for my refund since I still have not received it and initially he asked if he could give me cash back instead since I didn't receive it yet. I told him that was fine then all of a sudden he told me that I have to wait another day before he can do that.
Update: After coming back to this establishment for the third time, I was finally able to get a refund with no issues.

This place has absolutely terrible customer service and their food is contaminated with hair as well as being stale. (A coworker of mine got carrot cake that was stale)</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMni6s8C2oPWJ0ibeCShB8totCOikyCttnK6pqx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoIqOiyFMhY2X3-YLC7Ck1kKdKdqX3foywXORr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmxHDNhtJjpldr-CqRAPVivGkSxOf8B-kPsamd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLWnLeu0zXBiGUuNrBCbhj67V1N5D5opakBzLQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

I had ordered a 2 tier butterscotch cake along with the cupcakes for my kid's first birthday. The cake decorations and the flavor was outstanding. The decorations was exactly the way I had asked for, Good job guys🙂.< /text>

Ordered 3 mini tiffins today via DoorDash. Sambhar was missing from all 3 orders. The idlis very flat like uttapams and the dosas mangled/torn. Very disappointing.</Review>

I spoke to the baker and he was super nice he even offered to make the cake the same day I came in . I never had a bakery accept an order so early .
When I opened my box the cake was beautiful and it tasted delicious. I recommend this place for cakes .</Review>< userid>

I think he is behaving like that because he thinks there are no competitors for this in Folsom. But anyway all the restaurants which are doing great business will respect their customers and treat them well. But this guy with his arrogance and attitude will definitely lose his customers one by one(word of mouth is strong) it will definitely reach everyone. Since I am writing a public review, I don't want to talk anymore here.</review>< Pictures>

Has been treated badly many times and arrogant behavior growing exponentially.. Never go in weekend.. Taste is not great for attitude they show... It used to be good initially but once it becomes popular it's totally different now (taste and hospitality)</Text>

Tastes ok... they say buy one get one and increase the price of that particular item on that day. For the first time I saw someone charging packing fee. They charge $1 extra packing fee.  I ordered samosa chat and that night I had stomach upset. Very filthy quality food.Front desk people are so arrogant please learn how to talk and behave with customers.<//Text>

The guy in the counter is very rude and arrogant. We called to order puffs and the guy was shouting at us for calling. Its not customers fault if you change your process, so show some patience and respect for customers.<//text>

Their chaat tastes so very mediocre that you will end up feeling you are better off purchasing ingredients and preparing yourself. Compared to actual Indian standards, their chaat would be rated 1/10</text>

<Review>This petite, heartwarming bakery offers a wide selection of modern American and European-style cakes and pastries to traditional Indian homestyle snacks. The many varieties of cake also come in egg-free versions yet still maintain the delicate sponge cake layers and velvety whipped cream frosting present in their respective lavish versions that contain eggs. While a new. small bakery, they are ambitious with their desserts and are able to represent this in their confections, especially the mango and chocolate mousse pasties which are as delectable as they are elegant. The replicas of the traditional Indian street and comfort foods are guaranteed to satisfy anyone pleasing for authenticity and spice. It is definitely in the right sense to try visiting this bakery.< /Review>< username>

<rate>1<//rate><text>2 days back I had to order chole batura from bakery bites Folsom. This is the worst chole batura I had in my life. The batura was so hard that I had to use my two hands to make it into pieces and the chole curry is not at all good and not even near to the authentic recipe. With this recipe it better to stop serving Chole batura.<//text>< pics>

{'time': 1597001288290, 'text': 'Thanks bobby for the review. And sorry if you got the bhature hard. With all the hardship in running any service industry such as restaurant and preparing recipes day in and day out we might have had the bhature hard. Also with no dine in option and packing food to go would definitely add more on top of it. Like any dish chole has multiple ways of making it and any one recipe may not please everyone. We do serve hundreds of chole bhature every week. And we do have many people love our chole bhature. You are absolutely entitled to write your opinion and we value it, but our chole bhature may not be the one you are looking for. We truly appreciate you giving us a try.'}</Response>

They barely have any baked good. TERRIBLE customer service. Stood in line but when it was my turn, the cashier turned around and started packing other orders. He only turned around when another customer, from India, came in, and guess what...the cashier ignored me and started helping that other person!!!! I guess if you don't look indian, don't bother coming here, as other comments have already said.<//text>

<Name>Anand Mudlapur<//Name><Date>1580677196308<//Date><rating>4</rating><review>Love Bakery Bites. Reminds me of restaurants, growing up, in India. Don't go in to this restaurant expecting the typical experience you would expect in an Americanized eatary. Take a chance, if your taste is like mine, you might enjoy it.

The things I've tried so far are pav bhaaji, dosa varieties (make sure the cook is "Anachi"), rice varieties (bit on the spicier side) but I like it once in a way, definitely try the thali. It is cheap and worth the money.

The other things I've tasted are veg puffs and chaat. Didn't like the Bhel puri very much, it's had a typical taste that you get from any ready to eat Bhel puri . My  10 yr old kid loves it though. Again, beware of the spice levels.

Coming to pastries, these cakes remind me of the local bakery store every corner of a city in India has. :-). Love the cakes, it's light, not cloying and best of all, egg less (at least that's the claim!)</review>< pictures>

<text>Food taste is really bad.... Ordered masala utappam, Mysore masala dosa, samosa chat. After a long wait they ended up saying there is no masala utappam Instead they will serve masala dosa and I said okay to that....they brought 2 dosas.... to my surprise they brought 2 masala dosas and when I asked him that I ordered Mysore masala dosa he said that one is Mysore masala dosa and another is masala dosa. Attaching pics. I opened them and showed it to him. He is arguing one is Mysore masala dosa and another one masala dosa. Bad attitude. They are not even giving proper response. Samosa chat is cold.</text><name>Mallik Aitha</name></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I was quite disappointed being there yesterday.
I ordered pani puri and it was very very salty. I brought it up to them for which they kept telling that that's how they make it and it was fine. Finally when one more table complained of it, he took it back after 15 mnts of back and forth arguments and came with a new one, which tasted just okay as well.
Dahi puri tasted weird as well. Paneer puff had no flavor in it.
The only thing that tasted good was veg puff and the pastry.
Customer service is horrible as well, because when I did a follow up order of the puff and pastry, they literally took 20 minutes to give it to me. I had to follow up and remind 3 times.

This may be because they are new. But I definitely would not like to go again for this experience until they mature.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x809ae7fd96dd12bb:0xefb0a877946cebe0</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

There was a long wait time. Never ever buy Pani Puri, the Pani somewhat tastes like tamarind water. The customer service is worse.

The wait time was close to 30 minutes</Text>

This store is on the corner of Vernon and Long Beach Ave. Just another Liquor store except for the fact that it's near the Vernon light-rail station which sees tremendous foot traffic, and probably a significant number of those stop at Johnson's.<//review>

Fidencio, the manager was super duper helpful and kind! Had some issues with the tires on my BMW. He filled my tires and inspected them to make sure it was safe for me to drive. He suggested I go visit a tire place for further inspection. Then, he noticed i had my new license plates sitting on passenger seat and offered to install them for me - free of charge. How awesome! Will definitely be returning for an oil change. Thanks to Fidencio and his team - great experience, will be back!< /review>

<text>as soon as i left this location, my change oil light came on. it was not on before. my car overheated two afters after leaving this location.

not sure what they did to my car but they messed it up. don’t come to this location if you’re black, it’s risky. they’ll try to put water in your car apparently.

i hate i ever came here.</text>< pics>

I called in to inquire about what services you offered and a young lady which she told me her name and I forgotten it. However she went above and beyond in servicing me with her personalized skillset in finding a local certified Mechanic for my Tune up needs. I have been a customer of Valvoline since 2016.I wouldn't take any of my vehicles anywhere else. Thank you guys!👍🏼👍🏼< /text>

<Review>They quoted me a different price over the phone and once I got there they overcharged me. Staff was shady did not listen to the situation and of course didn't do what they said they would do for the price. Didn't check my tires, didn't know which oil to use and told me I didn't have a dipstick for my transmission fluid. Rather than ask me  where it was I was told I didn't have one.I was also told there was no way I had spoken to anyone in the shop about pricing. When I read the stores number back to the manager he lied and said that wasn't his number. Why lie about pricing? Why lie about services? Why lie about your own phone number as if I cant hear it ring in the shop when I call it? Wont be back. Will tell other people to watch out.   Edit: Customer service reached out and then things got worse. The response below is from corporate and they doubled down on the bad service I got. I wish I could share the emails.</Review>< Pics>

Great guys.  Manager and staff were super nice.  Quick oil change.  Even evacuated oil from the top so they didn’t have to mess with my old lower bolt.  Same thing with a screw on the filter that can strip out and cause problems.  Manager did it himself, showed me what can go wrong, and now I know more in the future.<//text>

Prices arent that bad. Friendly. Waiting in line maybe like 15 mins or 20 when they work your car it just depends what service you do but other than that its okay feels fast and like i said staff is friendly. Going back there for sure</Text>

I go to Valvoline for all my oil changes and maintenance. They are always very professional and polite. 15 min is all the majority of the services take, and best of all you don't have to leave your car for most services. I have never had to wait more than a few minutes if they are busy and they get me right in. I recommend that you check out all the services they offer, and they are quicker and cheaper then going to a dealership. The other thing I think is great is that they report all maintenance they perform to Carfax and that can only help with the value of vehicle when you go to sell it or trade it in. I highly recommend this place.< /Text>

Realized when I went to this valvoline for my previous and first oil change with this car on Sunset, they didn’t tell me or show me any of the filters (as it was near closing time and felt like they wanted to get me in and get me out). Bought my car used by one previous owner, which I told them and said it was my first oil change with this car; and I think that they maybe should’ve showed me the filters, just in case if the previous owner didn’t do a good enough job changing them when supposed to. Found out today after being shown them that they didn’t.<//text><Time>1617688558914<//Time>< rate>

Ya so this place charged me for an oil change and 4 days later my mechanic ripped me a new one for not having my oil changed and filters replaced. I was like, "I JUST had it done" but he didn't belive me based on the lack of detail. The oil did not look changed nor the filters. He showed me the quality of the oil and the murky filters. I was mortified. Thanks Valvoline for nothing< /Review>

My under shield fell off and my dealer only put it back with zip ties. Valvoline mentioned it and suggest I go to Autocenter to get the bolts. They promised to put them on if I come back. I did and they did without hassle.

Never felt pressure to go with the more expensive stuff or unnecessary changes like my filters.

Everyone thus far have been courteous and efficient.

If your car is not running well, this is the place to come. You will get a fast assessment of the problem, its resolution, and be back on the road in the shortest time possible. Don't hesitate, you will be very happy and return as a satisfied customer! They are probably good at solving personal problems too, but I haven't tried that yet!<//Review>

Awesome service. I will continue to have my oil changed, tires rotated & other services they offer. They do an amazing job on the services they do offer. They offered me other products but didn't shove them down my throat. I didn't even think about my tires & they did need rotating. A service they offer(ed). Thank you!</Text>

First time here, and I will definitely be returning! The customer service here was amazing and the wait time was about 15 mins. for my oil/filter change. They even let me wait inside my car as they made all the changes.  I hardly ever write reviews but I can't stress enough about my pleasant experience :) Thank you, Valvoline!</review>

It almost seems strange to say this, but I really enjoyed getting my oil changed here. While I never like giving people my money, it does help when those people go out of their way to show me that they see the same value in my money as I do. From the minute I pulled in until the second I drove off, I was treated with a level of respect that has become quite rare. Luckily, the crew at Valvoline is as good at caring for the vehicles as they are at caring for the people who drive them. This is the only quick change place I will use in Los Angeles.<//Text>

My regular mechanic made me aware of something this business is notorious for doing after it already happened to me. I went in for a basic oil change and they told me I had an oil leak due to a stripped drain plug and that an actual mechanic would have to fix it. My long standing mechanic told me he sees a ton of people coming from Valvoline with the same issue because the mechanics there aren’t well trained enough and ruin threads and instead of owning up to it and fixing it, they say it was like that before. DO NOT GO HERE. I wish there was a way I could give 0 stars.< /text>

<review>Each of the 4 or 5 technicians I talked to during my visit were highly courteous and professional. Very clear, simple, non-pushy explanations of exactly which services were being offered/performed and price point. To me it looked like the team working had a very efficient work flow going. The whole process was quick and painless. I don't usually expect this level of professionalism and courtesy when getting an oil change. Will be back.< /review>< Pics>

The wait here isn't too bad. The employees are always helpful. Though, no fault of the own (it's they're job), they do try to up still everything -but they're not pushy about it. I've been going here for 4 years.</review>

I do not love driving, I do not love having a car, but the first time I knew I needed an oil change, I gave this place a try. Ever since, I come for whatever services they provide that I need. I just got my oil changed there again, and it was like going to a spa (but for my car). The team is amazing, incredibly fast, and HIGHLY professional. They were changing my oil, but I felt like they were preparing for a space shuttle launch. The best part? I was in and out in less than 15 minutes.< /Review>

Went first time to Valvoline and now I'm thinking "Where the hell was I going before?". These guys jump on your car right away, so I was out in 15-20 min. When at other places it takes 1-2 hours, because people are walking around your car, telling jokes and scratching their asses. My technician today was Leo. Cool dude, very professional and polite. Thank you, Valvoline. I will be back for my next oil change.<//text>

I appreciate they didn't whine about each piece piece of the job like other stores that say, oh we are going to charge you to remove your tire, another charge to mount your tire, another charge to balance, and another to dispose of your old tires. They just did all the parts of the job and gave me one price which I appreciate. Another very important task they completed was getting my hubcaps back on tight. Thanks i appreciate that.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Great staff helpful and knowledgeable.  My bumper was missing a bolt .they fixed it no charge. I can drive up and they will check the tires and add air if needed. They recommended a mechanic  for work they didn't do. The place was wonderful. Open spacious lobby to wait. Water or coffee free.<//text>

Best deal i found on bringing your own tires into get put on. But they forget to call me almost everytime to let me know they are finished and ive had my lug nuts broke off while installing and had to pay extra. I still go here every time because i save usually 60.00 per set compared to other places.<//Text>

Best tire/running gear service in the area. What Les Schwab USED to be 30 years ago. Friendly employees, parts and tires priced better than anyone else. All around good shop. There is a place to wait inside OR you can walk over to Mod Pizza, Chipotle, and In N Out.</text>

<text>I at one point really liked this place.  The last couple of visits have been disappointing.  I went to have an alignment...ended up having to bring my car back.  The alignment was not done to correctly.  Then brought in another vehicle a few days later to fix a flat.  Guess what?  Still leaking.  So, as I sit at a different shop...getting the tire fixed, I write this review.  A few other minor thing happened at my last visits.  Sad to think I am now will be taking my business elsewhere.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Came in to have a tire fixed; the guys were so kind to me, I was in and out and since it turned out there was nothing wrong with the tire it just needed to be sealed better around the rim they didn't charge me. Outstanding place, I will definitely be buying tires the next time I need them. This is how you build a loyal local customer base... thanks again for your kindness Robert!!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><UserId.>108869148508381980107</UserId.><Resp>{'time': 1582924407020, 'text': 'that is what Point S stands for, the point of Service! :) servicing our customers quickly and efficiently is just how we roll! we appreciate your business! thank you for the recommendation!'}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x54d3fff824c564af:0x34fe8b1db0478943< /Gmap_id></record>

I needed a new tire, they helped me out with pricing and were very friendly. And their new lobby is very nice. I will be going back for future needs.<//Text>

I am so grateful for people in the world like these guys. And they were very knowledgeable about where to go to get other things fixed in my car. Thank you guys!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Once they got my tires on, the alignment was really quick. I was in and out of there in just under two hours. The staff is friendly and helpful, and their prices are pretty darn good. This is definitely a spot where you get good value for your hard earned money.< /text>< userid>

The staff was super friendly and nice. The shop was super clean with seats to sit in and wait.  They get you in and out real fast.  They do a great detailed job and they take care of your car.  The shop and store front were easy to locate from the street as well. They have decent buisnness hours as well. Definitely a decent tire spot.<//review>

<text>Great friendly knowledgable staff. They ll fix a flat or get you a set of 4  fast and the best prices around. I highly recommend.  I was heading out of town when I noticed I had a slow leak. Stopped at les Schwab who didnt have time to help me. Next door at Discount they fixed the nail puncture immediately and wouldnt charge me! I became a confirmed customer from then on. Today I got a new set of 4 radials. Saved a lot of money from other stores. They had me out the door,no wait, in 45 min.Very happy! Thanks guys!</text>< time>

<name>Richard Harlan<//name><date>1491752364639<//date><Rating>4< /Rating><text>It looks a little run down outside and is next to a tile place that's not labeled very well (oddity and they're moving soon so meh), and you might think to yourself "why go here when I can go to Les Schwab right next door?"

I'll tell you why: my BMW had a nail in the front driver side tire, and I have run flat tires. If you live in the area you know that the Local BMW dealership doesn't so tires. So I looked elsewhere. Honestly I did go to Les Schwab first, and they told me I had to buy a whole brand new tires because it was IMPOSSIBLE to fix that kind of tire.

Knowing that wasn't true at all, I went over to the guys at Discount tire and they had it looked at, fixed and me on my way in less than an hour. They even did the whole repair for free! Haven't had a problem since and that was over 2 weeks ago.<//text>< pics>

Poor communication, poor customer service, very slow turnover times, and unprofessional business conduct from owners wife resulting in weeks of delayed time, frustrating conversations, and no end resolution. As customers, this is far from the type of service we seek. Save yourself headache and find another shop. Not recommended.< /text>

Knowledgeable service, and although the turnaround was not fast (about two weeks), they gave me a realistic expectation of the timeframe from the very beginning, and were able to diagnose and quote the fix for my issue right away.< /Review>

< Review>
This place has done a complete turn around since new owners took over. The previous owner was very ill and passed away. That is why last year no one could get in touch with anyone and why all the negative reviews. That is not the case now. They are great, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Great service.</Review>

These guys and ladies are amazing. I took our gas powered blower in and without charging me they let me know it could not be salvaged. I also picked up a refurbished gas powered weed eater and lawn mower, excellent condition. The customer service is 5 stars alone! They know their stuff! They are the new owners but they really know the business, look past the reviews from a year ago. They took over after the old owner passed away, they have been running this shop since his passing and unfortunately the business page is linked with Gary's Mower and everyone that was posting bad stuff was posting while the previous owner was ill and passing away. I wish more people understood that before putting this shop on blast!<//Text>

<Review>I do not recommend this place! I tried to call them at least 12 times, no answer and mailbox is full. I had to drive there, just to find out the young man working there had a real attitude and complaining how backed up he was with work. I went there last year and had a new carburetor put into my lawnmower since then I used it 4 or 5 times and there is a problem with the carburetor. I would think it lasts longer than a year. Immediately he said I probably had it sitting too long, however I have put gasoline stabilizer into it and it should not mess up the carburetor. When  I asked him if he could look at my lawnmower he told me they have only three weeks of warranty and he would have to rebuild it. As far as I’m informed most parts have a warranty for at least one year. His attitude is terrible and this is not how you want to keep your clients! I told him I’m going to fix it myself and walked out. Never again will I go there.< /Review><time>1527035912863< /time><user_name>Angelika Harwwod</user_name>< resp>

I took my pressure washer in because it wouldn't start. I was told wattenty work had been done and I owed $30.00. They had the machine for three weeks. Brought the washer home. It's been a few months since I brought it home. It wouldn't start. Because, gas lines were missing or cracked. In essence they did nothing. I'm fixing it myself< /text>

<Review>Brought in for hard start leave blower, left there for week. No phone calls, when I went pickup, the 14 years old helper said the cylinder is scored. The only explanation, is that its not worth the money to repair, and if I want them to scrap it. I took it home and notice the cylinder bolts is loose, and tighten it, put new fuel in it and start right up. I thought Gary should at least show his face for the courteous for charge the diagnostic fee. I do not think he give any  customer service at all.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x809ae13033b7e885:0x65d87b42bff347a9< /GmapID></record>

< Review>
One of the best service repairs I have experienced in a long time.  Our lawn mower runs like new again!  Pat was great with calling to schedule my appointment and calling again when the repairs were complete.  I would highly recommend them for all small engine repairs and would certainly do business with them again!<//Review>

<text>I went to this shop, give them a call before going, helpful counter service. It appears he’s hired some good people to help. They were able to sharpen my chainsaw blade same day.
I’m in the industry, this business is undergoing very typical experience of a local repair shop. Owner explained he has his own challenges personal or other, he can’t hire good help in this business climate, so he is doing the best he can. Saw a sign hanging “under new management”. Give them another try.

They typically get repair requests from landscape contractors and homeowners, unfortunately for some, the contractor gets serviced first because he’s dependent on his equipment to earn a living. Also typical homeowner drops off broken, neglected equipment, then thinks will run like new, and good luck. Then homeowner takes patch-repaired equipment home to apply the same know-how to it, runs it hard and puts it back in the barn wet, and it breaks again. Not the fault of this shop.

The industry has also complicated matters by releasing a constant stream of cheep mowers to places like Waliworld, Cears, HD, Lowers. Assembled in places from Mexico to Thailand and 7 places in China, with parts not available over the counter, it becomes a full-time research project trying to find replacement parts. It slows down repair times waiting for parts or confirmation that parts are in fact available, if this owner even gets the courtesy of a call back from the parts guys. I understand his issues because I’ve lived it.

If you need your busted equipment fixed, take it here and have a realistic conversation about your needs, if you don’t hear what you like in the conversation take it home with you same day.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809ae13033b7e885:0x65d87b42bff347a9<//gmap_id></record>

<text>This place is ridiculous they have had my lawn mower for 3 weeks I called and they told me that there was no number on the invoice went to Egypt the number they read back to me was incorrect I don't know where that number came from it was not my phone number that I wrote down so then I was told they would put me at the top of the list a week past and I still have not heard from them I called and was told that the purchase order is not complete but it is fixed it's been 3 weeks.  I brought my lawn mower from Sears and Sears does their business through this company for their warranties no wonder Sears is going out of business because apparently they have no standards</text><gmapID>0x809ae13033b7e885:0x65d87b42bff347a9</gmapID>< Pictures>

I give it one star because they gave my grandpa back his lawn motor. The large sweaty man was extremely irate and very racist towards us. I would not recommend this place to anyone who has morals and family values. He was a poor excuse of a father due to the fact that he was acting poorly in front of his own son. He is a very negative individual. I'm pretty sure his days and his business is numbered.< /review>

<Text>Never answer phone had our saw for 6 weeks when we were told it would be a week and a half to 2 weeks. Very rude on phone when they answered and we were told a $40 repair when it went in and it is now $80 to get it back. Then they say they have so many orders ahead of ours but they should have known this when I dropped it off.</Text>< username>

Horrible customer service.  None is answering the phone and very rude people too. There is no answering system to leave a message.   Never go there at all.  I don't understand why Sears has contracted with this lousy repair shop.  No wonder Sears Department Store is losing businesses because of contracting their repair with this terrible shop.< /review>

<Review>Beware of everything about this shop. It is a shame that they are the only warranty shop nearby for troy built. Absolute worst customer service I have ever witnessed. Brought my mower in to ask for an estimate on repairs. Two weeks pass and no call back. I called and asked if the estimate was ready and they acted like I was stupid to be calling so soon. Another week goes by and no call back. I call again and they tell me the repairs are 1/2 way done and the total I owe is X (before calling and telling me what repairs are needed and actually getting my go ahead to do the repairs). Then tell me a part needed to finish the repair is on back order. They again acted as if my call for a status was a huge burden. No eta on the parts. Call again in another week and no part in. Call again in another week and they say, Oh, yeah, that's been done for a while now. Thanks for the heads up! I don't understand how such a poorly run business can keep its doors open.<//Review>< user>

Raj was extremely helpful during free consultation,  really went above and beyond to explain our deductions and w4 mistakes. Prepared me and my wife for 2021. Great experience strongly recommended for novice tax filers who are unsure of certain tax stuff..lol..< /review>

Last week, I called in and made an appointment with Carmen. I told her about my situation and asked for pricing up front. She told me it would be 180 cause my tax is a little complicated. I go in there, and I tried to reconfirm what we discussed. She said it would now be 300. When I asked how it went up, she said it's more complicated and there are things she would need to do to make sure I get the most of my return....horrible< /text><Date>1550625696625</Date><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<Review>I was extremely overcharged for a Minsk service and feel completely taken advantage of. I’m not sure how $169 turns into $363 with just 1 w-2 and no other forms that need to be input. I will never be back.< /Review>< Pics>

In Style Dental is the best dental office! Their staff is very professional and nice. Dr. Kar is amazing!! Everyone is very caring! I have been going there for over 15 years now and I do not mind the 2 1/2 hour drive to get there. I would not change them for the world! Dr. Kar and his staff are truly the best!!</review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I LOVE InStyle dental. I have anxiety about going to the dentist, but I've been a patient of InStyle for over 10 years now and I go for a cleaning and checkup every 6 months. Dr. Kar is prompt, caring, and efficient; My go-to hygienist is Krishna - she is incredibly kind and patient, knows my sensitive areas, she's very gentle and thorough. I moved out of the area a few years ago and I make special trips for my dental appointments so I can continue to get care here - that's how good they are! Highly recommend InStyle.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< GmapID>

Hello, I’m Derek and am a teenager, who has been to Instyle Dental in San Gabriel, CA for more than five years.  Dr. Park, Dr. Kar, and the dental hygienists are always gentle with me and my younger sister.  They make going to the dentist a less scary experience.  Also the front office staff treat us well and let us have toys or stickers after each visit.  Now, I just need to brush teeth more often :-0!</Review>

First it was easy to get a appointment. (They answer the phone) And the hygienist is great. Very thorough. And the place is spotless.< /text>

I’m afraid of the dentist and have been through numerous offices, but for the last 5 years and going forward, I have found my Dentist office for life!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I have been going to see Dr. Brian Kar for years. He is a great dentist, attentive listener, and a master in keeping clients comfortable during procedures. His office is beautiful, clean, and modern. His staff is welcoming and helpful. Highly recommend!</review>

My first born has been with Dr. Park for about 5 years and we love her as well. Thank you to the front office staff for getting me in right away. Dr. Kar and his assistant were so helpful and worked well with my uncooperative daughter. I appreciate the work put in to make my daughter more comfortable. Dr. Kar and his assistant had her favorite cartoon on Netflix, let her participate, and tried not to force her to open her mouth. I'm truly grateful. Everyone was great.< /Text>< Time>

<Review>I have been seeing Dr. Kar for about 10 years.
Now my entire family are seeing Dr. Kar including my granddaughters.
Dr. Kar is a soft-speaking and very knowledgeable Dentist.
I am always enjoying paying him a visit in his newly built, awards-winning InStyle Dental office.
Dr. Kar is a very nice doctor I highly recommended to all my friends.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I was a longtime customer but had to leave because of my insurance.  When my insurance changed again, I decided to return to InStyle.  I was pleased to come back. I received excellent cleaning with only gentle reminders to floss, rather than the semons had to endure at the last place.< /Text>

I’m a new patient and from out of town visiting. I lost my filing, fortunately I was able to get an appointment. The support staff members were very professional and friendly. The male dental assistant was great and put me at ease. Dr. Kar was the final touch that made my dental visit a positive experience.</Review>

Dr. Kar and his staffs always care and put the clients needs first. Dr. Kar took time to ask me questions and gave me an honest update on the future care of my teeth. The facility is very clean and has ample parking. Highly recommend for everyone.< /text>

<Review>Everyone at InStyle is helpful.  I recently switch dentists after 30+ years and am happy I did.  Dr. Kar is fantastic as is Dr. Morcos (periodontist).  We are extremely pleased with the diligence and patience of Dr. Park (pediatric) with our young children and Dr. Kim (orthodontics) with our oldest son.  Everything is always explained up front and concerns addressed before the work begins. Michael and Carolina always make our family of 6 feel comfortable and visits are always easy.  The team is helpful when needing to reschedule and coordinate appointments for the family.  Thank you!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Front office gals are friendly and helpful.  Krishna (Dental Hygienist) is great—incredibly kind and very thorough with her cleaning.  Dr. Karr is a a steadfast professional.

Always love the way my teeth feel after I leave; so clean!  Been coming here for possibly a decade.  Since I started as a bachelor, I’ve since brought my wife and now our 3 kids.< /Review>

My son had a good experience with Dr. Kar. He made him feel at ease when getting his cleaning. He’s also getting braces and the Orthodontist is super nice and explains everything clearly before she does it. The whole staff is very friendly and welcoming to us when we arrive. It’s been a great experience.< /Review>

We had another fabulous visit at InStyle Dental. Our appointment was at 3pm and my twins were in the chair by 3:01pm. This is huge when you have two young kiddos and a busy schedule. I love that every time I come in, they take you in right on time. The staff are all extremely friendly and welcoming. They are very patient with my kiddos especially my son who is very sensory sensitive. They show the kids and explain everything they are going to do before they do it. Our experience at this office is far superior to any other office we have been to with my kids.<//text>

My family has been coming to Dr Kar and Instyle Dental for 10 yrs. The care we receive is bar none. I used to dread going to the dentist as a kid as I’m sure many others can attest to as a common childhood experience. Dr Kar has managed to cultivate a practice that is both welcome and professional. What used to be a dreaded experience has become a seamless part of our family routine. My children look forward to their dental visits. From the warm and friendly staff to the state of the art, impeccably clean office I can honestly say I enjoy my visits. Dr Kar is my dentist for life.<//Review>

<Text>The very first moment I stepped foot in this office, I said to myself “man, this place is nice and so clean!” The staff was so friendly and down to earth. They’d make you feel like you’ve known them for a long time and not first time meeting. Doctor Kar is very knowledgeable at his field. He’s also calm. When you see a calm dentist, you become calm as well. That’s always a plus.<//Text>< pics>

price is good. I'm picky with my hygienist.  Nice clean environment, smells fresh. As long as I can afford it, this is the place for me.< /Text>

Let me first state that I am in the group that only writes a business review when I've either had a terrible experience or an exemplary one.  In this instance, InStyle Dental absolutely came through for my family.  Living through unprecedented times with the Covid-19 pandemic, our 5 year old daughter was experiencing extreme tooth pain this past week.  She was scheduled to have several cavity fillings this month with her current pediatric dentist but their practice was closed and they were not seeing any patients during this time. The only option they offered was a referral to a dental surgeon to have her teeth extracted which was not a viable consideration as her adult molars were not expected to grow in for another 5-6 years.

Feeling deserted and frustrated in a time of need, we searched Yelp and came across InStyle Dental's highly rated business.  We were very fortunate to find out that Dr. Kar was available and was willing to see patients in emergency instances and we were able to schedule an appointment the following day.  Considering that this was our daughter's first in-depth dental experience, Dr. Kar and his assistant Michael were nothing short of amazing.  Their calm demeanors and approach kept our daughter feeling comfortable throughout the whole procedure.  The facility is top notch, the equipment is state of the art and all of the instruments were clean and or wrapped which included the tv remote.  With Netflix available, our daughter kept still for the duration as she was able to choose her favorite Power Rangers show which kept her mind busy and at ease.

In this time of stress, my wife and I are very thankful for Dr. Kar.  Our daughter is no longer in pain, is able to eat again and is back to her happy self.  We would 100% recommend InStyle Dental to all.</text>

Very pleased with my experiences thus far. I am not a fan of going to the dentist; never really have been. So finding a new dentist wasn't a priority of mine. I was referred to InStyle Dental by my significant other. He spoke very highly regarding the facility and the state of the art equipment so I finally decided to go. The staff is very attentive and professional. I was also impressed with the structure of the spaces. It was very convenient to have everything in the same space so that I didn't have to move from room to room for the cleaning, x-rays, check up etc. Dr. Kar was also great. I would recommend this facility to others.< /review>

We had gone to another dentist for over 20 years, so finding another one as good as our previous one was going to be hard! InStyle delivered everything we wanted in a quality dental office! Dr. Karr is great, caring and listens to our concerns! His staff is equally committed to providing a welcoming and caring environment. From the time you enter their office to the time you leave, you are surrounded by very professional people who care for all your dental needs! I am very comfortable with Dr. Kate and his staff and would highly recommend them to anyone needing a great dentist!<//Review>

Had what I thought was a dental emergency. Called InStyle Dental and they took me in as soon as they could. The good Dr Kar tookcare of me. I was comfortable and felt like I was in good care. I'm not big on dental visits. Coming here has definitely helped change my mind about going to the dentist. Would recommend InStyle Dental to anyone who needs great care.</text>

One of the only dental offices I've been to that actually that see patients on time.
Dr. Kar was very gentle and the atmosphere of the office was overall very comfortable and state of the art.
You also get nice text messages and reminders from a friendly staff if that's important to you.< /Text>

It is very convenient to have other specialists in the clinic.  Our two kids 19 years old and 10 years also have braces done by the orthodontist there.  I did not like going to the dentist until I came to instyle dental.  Since I use in style dental,  every year I have a routine tooth cleaning, and therefore very little work is needed. We rarely have any cavity. We are happy to keep going there for a long time even thought we moved to Santa Monica, it is worth to go to Instyle Dental..all of all it is a five star dentist because their facility is clean and up to date equipment and moreover the beautiful parking in the back.

You know that anxiety that you have as a parent knowing that your child will eventually have to see the dentist? I researched high and low and found InStyle Dental and they were more than amazing with him. My son has been a patient of InStyle Dental for several years. We were originally patients of Dr. Liu and absolutely LOVED him. So when he had to retire last year due to health reasons we were so distressed because there simply couldn't be anyone like him. Well that's what we thought. Dr. Chrissy Park took over his position as the pediatric dentist and she is just as AMAZING! Our daughter recently had her first visit with Dr. Park and she had the best time of her life! Dr. Park is just as patient and gentle as Dr. Liu was. Her exam was thorough while still being sensitive to the fact that she was dealing with a toddler so she used great distraction techniques to get through the cleaning and gave them breaks as needed. Both my kids look forward to their dentist visits now and ask when they can see the dentist again! Hallelujah!

The staff at the office is also so competent and courteous. We've had way too many occasions where the doctor we see is great, but the office staff is not.  I'm happy to say this is not the case here.  They get back to you when they say they will and are not lazy. They always take us on time and they schedule enough time between patients to allow the dentist to have ample time to spend with each child. Unfortunately, our insurance does not cover the cost of the visits here so we had to pay quite a bit, however, it was worth every penny.  Quality counts!< /text>

Dr. Kar is THE BEST! He and his entire staff are kind, caring, efficient, and thorough. The dental office is the most beautiful I have ever seen. I was referred to Dr. Kar by a friend of mine, and it was the BEST move I have ever made.<//Text>

Two of my kids are in the process of having braces at Instyle dental. My oldest already completed braces and has a beautiful smile now. It has made her more confident. The staff is very knowledgeable and provides gentle care to their patients. Michael is very good with kids and makes them feel at ease. Dr. Kim explains the ortho procedures well. Dr. Kar is our general dentist and provides excellent care for the entire family. The schedule is limited but Carolina always makes it work. Would highly recommend. 👍</Text>

I have been Dr. Brian Kar’s Patient since the first  day  he opened his dental office which was so many years ago. Dr. Kar has gentle hands, very professional and friendly. In addition, his team is very professional as well. Oh, I must say that Dr. Kar’s office is exceptional. I strongly recommend Dr. Kar and his team to you.

I have been seeing Dr. Kar since I was a litttle girl and Dr. Kar and his team are very knowledgeable and friendly. They are punctual and I never wait long to be called in for my appt. They are good with communication; call/text to remind me of my appointment and working me into their schedule. Most importantly, I appreciate the staff for informing me about how to properly maintain dental hygiene and educating me about preventive care. This allows me to be more involved with my dental care and maintain a healthy smile! I will be forever thankful for Instyle Dental for my beautiful teeth and smile!</text>

I had a dental emergency when my tooth cap, done by another dentist, fell off and even though I didn't have dental insurance, Dr. Kar promptly helped me. The procedure was quick & pain-free and now two yrs later my tooth is still securely in place without any problems. I highly recommend Dr. Kar and InStyle Dental.< /text>

<Text>I have been coming to InStyle Dental for over 10 years. The staff is always courteous & professional. It has always impressed me that I never have to wait for my appointment. I can't say enough about Dr. Kar's gentle and skillful hands. I have a big fear of dental procedures due to past experiences but Dr. Kar have put my fears at ease knowing I'm under his care. Now my husband and son are also happy patients of InStyle Dental.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

{'time': 1429041121744, 'text': "We are sorry to hear that our office hours and availability does not accommodate your schedule.  We understand and appreciate your concern.\n\nThere may have been some misunderstanding about how the orthodontic process works since the initial orthodontic consultation was done with your son's father.  Our schedule Orthodontic days and the need for early intervention (Phase I) was clearly explained to him.  His father understood and agreed to the treatment that was presented.\n\nThe request for records was delayed due to the issues with your insurance company and the conflicted address.  Furthermore, there were issues with the dental insurance benefit of coordination as you had requested the transfer of records to another location only a week after you had agreed to start treatment of his case.\n\nWe are glad you found an office that can accommodate your schedule and that you are satisfied with your son's new Orthodontist.\n\nAll the best,\nInStyle Dental"}< /Response>
< Review>
Don't go here for Orthodontic work.  The Orthodontist is only in Once and Month and did not even do his proper assessment before putting braces on some baby teeth causing issues with the permanent teeth coming in.
Spend your money with a Real Orthodontist that has regular office hours so if there are any issues you do not have to wait a month.
Besides that it was virtually impossible to get my child's records from them even though by Law they have to provide me with a copy if requested.< /Review>

No parking,people out side not wearing a mask in front of the door, people pack in side the door way  call on the phone to get my order and the phone number they gave said we glad you called but we are busy right now and hangs up called over 7 times still hang ups  Continue finaly I went inside through all the people wearing my mask ask please bring out my food to my car
The man said sorry we are busy your food only only been ready for a few min. Got home with cold food 40.96
Didn't feel save walking inside to many people crammed together no space
IHOP was my favorite place to eat breakfast
Just not safe
Glad they are getting there busyness back but Please do it safely and if you don't do curbside pick-up on busy days let people know on-line before we come to that mess< /Text>< pics>

<text>The overall service provided was great in my opinion. I was immediately greeted by a polite woman upon entering the establishment. She served as my waitress and throughout my visit she constantly asked if I was doing okay, while providing much needed assistance and suggestions.

I also found this establishment fairly clean with properly prepared food. I, as well as my significant other, had both ordered a burger and found that they tasted great and were very well-done.

A very satisfactory experience all-in-all. I couldn't have asked for better service and food from a local IHOP establishment.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuaMnQum0Y0S6jRysXPB034DmGBhsCqu5U5EXE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Just ordered a new classic breakfast bowl for curbside pickup. It was fast and easy. The service was friendly and the food is delicious and for $5.99 you get so much food. I didn’t even know my order came with pancakes. Way to go Ihop great experience< /review>

They are having a dinner happy hour now for like $6.99. Good selection of items on that list plus the full menu. Had never really thought of them for dinner but have been there 2 times this week just for the happy hour< /review>

< review>
The staff and ESPECIALLY manager, were very kind! They have great customer service skills, and I’m thankful for the managers kindness!

I did a online pick up order, and for some reason, it said my card didn’t go through, EVEN though it took the money out of my account and said IHOP. I called the IHOP to notify them, and they said they didn’t get my order, and that it didn’t go through.

I explained to the manager that it took the money out of my account, and he said it probably went to the one on hatch and to call them first, and give them a call back and they would make my order for me:)!

I have cash app, so cash app actually took my money, put it towards IHOP, and then refunded me back. So if this ever happens to you, wait about 10 minutes and your money should be back! I ended up getting my money back from Cash App and reordering from IHOP.

I’m thankful that they didn’t use a rude tone with me and were extremely nice and took my thoughts into consideration even though I was wrong. I didn’t get the managers name, but I’m extremely thankful for him! This iHop always provides great service!< /review>

The crepes had the pumpkin flavor but it was not good it was definitely missing something I felt like it tasted a lot like egg which was pretty gross. I didn't eat it.< /review>< username>

Pathetic!  I get there and I assume the manager brought the food out assuring and reassuring everything’s there.  I get home and 1/4 of my order is missing!  I called multiple times and they don’t want to answer the phone.  I’m calling their complaint line and will continue to call until they answer.  Bad for business really.</text>

I knew when I pulled in the parking lot it was a bad idea.  I knew to stick with Dennys.  Anyway, we went in and ordered.  Shocking enough we had someone take our order within 5 minutes of sitting BUT then we waited 42 minutes for our meal.  Apparently our waitress forgot to enter our meal.  Ummmm  okay.  They offered a 10% discount for our inconvenience.  I told them NO, we will just leave.  Then the manager offered 50% off and I said fine we would stay but I will never come back.  AND I WONT.<//text>

Came here because it’s 24 hours and had a wonderful experience. Makayla was an amazing hostess. She was the only one waiting tables and did a wonderful job making sure everyone was satisfied. Very friendly and upbeat. Needless to say she received a nice tip. Will definitely be coming back here rather than to the one closer to home.<//text>

I said in this place 20 minutes before they acknowledged my presence! I don't know if it was because I was black or not, but when they finally noticed me and took another 5 or 10 minutes before they came to take my order. The service was horrible I love IHOP and I have been too many but I will never go back to this one!!!</Text>

<Review>I'm giving this place 1 star because that's the lowest I can go. First our server brought food out to people who were seated and ordered after us. Then when our food did come she had given my order to someone else and gave me the wrong plate. She took it back and had it remade and brought back the wrong order AGAIN. I ordered a simple build your own omelette cheese, spinach and peppers it's not that complicated. At this point I just told her never mind. My husband is eating breakfast by himself and YES I'm writing this review instead of enjoying my food with him. The waitress didn't seem like she cared too much. I definitely would not recommend this IHOP.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809051744c5e6d85:0x3e60880229b0e00b</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>IHOP is always good. The food always cooked like I like it and presentation is great. Only problem tonight was we had to wait a long time to be seated. Granted it was a quiet time of night but the hostess didn't check to see if there were any new customers. On the plus side,  music was really loud and we both had bad headaches. We asked them to turn it down and they were happy to do so</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Late night dinner. Very good food and delightful service. Our waitress (Makayla - not positive on spelling), was super sweet and made our dining experience very enjoyable (talk about service with a smile!). She was very attentive, polite and nothing but sweet. We made sure to tip her well. All in all a nice place to eat, highly recommend.<//Text>

<Review>Visited on a very busy Christmas morning after church services. It was a party of 3 and we waited only 10 minutes. Food was excellent. Our waitress was the best and always kept checking on us with a smile. Entire staff was on point for such a busy day. I commented it to the manager on what excellent food, service and staff they had. Very great place to go for breakfast. With great menu.< /Review>< gmapID>

Friendly atmosphere, welcoming staff, our waitress provided overall excellent service and we greatly appreciated her attentiveness. I ordered the egg white spinach omelette, fruit, a harvest grain pancake, with coffee. Everything was brought hot and fresh tasting to the table. You're brought your own small carafe of their smooth, aromatic, medium roast coffee for refills, which stayed hot throughout our meal. Prices are reasonable and the rest of the menu looked great, we'll be returning for sure.</review>

Typical fast American flare breakfast. I had to request substitutions with vegetables to make my meal a little bit healthy and palatable. Needless to say I avoid eating at these places like the plague, but in a small town with limited options, I was glad this IHOP was around and open. The service was prompt. I couldn't finish my meal, portions were for two people.<//text>

Wasn't bad, wasn't over the top good. Service was decent for arriving at a shift change. Your average middle of the road fare you get anywhere.</Text>

<Review>Today, after undergoing a medical exam, I decided it was urgent that I eat something. In going to IHOP on Orangeburg, I knew I would have excellent service and food prepared to my liking. Lissa had served me once before several months ago, and she gives consistently superb service. A message came in that required my being at home. When I asked for my bill, she told me someone had already  paid for my meal.  Tears of gratitude immediately flowed. To you, whomever you are, have blessed me today, and I know God will bless you for this kind deed. Please accept my heartfelt thanks,  and I shall pass this forward.😘< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I went with my friends after watching a movie at night. The food was okay, not super good or anything. The service was slow, I was passed up a few times when my drink was empty. I'd say to not go at night as it is evident that the employees dont want to be there and will serve you as little as possible.</review>

<Text>I had a terrific time eating at this IHOP restaurant of Modesto. Our server was the restaurant manager, I believe, and she was very nice and accommodating. The food was good and it filled me up. The pancakes, which is the signature dish, was not too appetizing. I used a coupon and they didn't frown upon this, unlike other restaurants. Overall, I recommend this restaurant due to the food, customer service and its location.</Text>< Pics>

Service was ok girl was new forgot the silver ware which has the napkins forgot to tell the cook about the sauce on the side which she apologized and gave a senior discount which was nice. Now the food was  great I would recommend that when trying new stuff that has sauce to ask for it on the side, because you might not like it or they might put to much of it. Now if new to the area expect to see homeless people in the parking lot asking for money.< /review>

<Review>The food what you expect not  bad. But I love  Eli to be my waitress she's always on top of everything, she always has a smile, she always gives you the best customer service. That's why we keep coming back to this IHOP.<//Review>< user>

We had to wait 10 minutes to be seated
There were 3 tables that were empty an needed cleaning
Plus the waitress didn't come take our order at least 10 minutes later
Not too mention our meal took 25 minutes
Before we got too eat
An the restroom was very dirty
Toilet paper on the floor an paper towels over flowing the trash bin
My pancake was under cooked an bacon as well
I didn't feel the waitress was respectful enough about asking me if i wanted a fried pancake to go<//text>

<Text>The service was great!! However, the change from IHOP to IHOB (burgers) was ill-advised. Do not go for the burgers, as you will be disappointed. Denny's burgers (and fries) are WAY better. Also, there is a big asterick next to "kids eat free" if you have more kids than adults.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Food was bland, order was wrong, and the wait from taking my order to getting my food was terrible. I wouldn't have been upset or cared, but the dining room was empty. Now I know why.< /review>

Very accessible and family friendly. However, the staff is courteous to all age groups at any time of day. The only drawback would be that during the late night or early morning hours, their fryers have a habit of being non-functional. Though it is a minor thing, it is worth noting.< /Text>

<Review>We went for my dad's birthday with a party of 8 and waited 45min. We told them it was fine  to seat us sepwrate and waited another 15 minutes so we decided to leave. For being a family oriented place they should've told us a wait time or tell us they couldn't do it. Groups of 2 and four kept being served before us. Never would they service us if we kept waiting since they never made a table available!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The food was decent for the price. The restaurant was very clean and the bus boys were cleaning the tables with hot steamy water not just a wet rag in their apron. Our food came out quickly but my omlette was the wrong one. She took it back and I got a new one around 5 min later. My biggest issue would have to be that the spoon full of sour cream I got on the side was $1.29. That seems excessive. I also asked for extra mushrooms; I didnt not get charged for it neither do i think I received them. The staff was nice and prompt but a little closer to details would make it a 5 star visit.<//text>

Renamed it to IHOD international house of DICKS.
my daughters, grandbabies A and I all went here for breakfast left after being ignored for over 45 minutes. We are servers also so we're very understanding however this was all around ignorance. Never again.<//text>

We told them it was fine  to seat us sepwrate and waited another 15 minutes so we decided to leave. For being a family oriented place they should've told us a wait time or tell us they couldn't do it. Groups of 2 and four kept being served before us. Never would they service us if we kept waiting since they never made a table available!</Review><Response>None<//Response><Date>1483475011719< /Date>< Rating>

Good pancakes, even better hash browns. Service is friendly but on the slower side (even when fairly empty).</Text>

<Text>Even at their busiest the food is fast and spot on, the waitress seemed to be well versed in speed writing as she took 5 of our orders in an accurate and speedily fast manner, the food was not to far along after that.  Parking is a bit of a challenge on busy days and Sundays but worth the wait for good food in a relaxed atmosphere.< /Text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

The worst place ever went there a couple of time all were bad tried again today just wanted pancakes and coffee the coffee cups were dirty sent them back got two new ones that also were dirty I am sorry but I do not want to drink coffee with someone's lipstick on rum of glass  told manager and he didnt seem concerned at all so needless to say  I will never return to IHOP on orangeburg rd most disgusting place I have ever been to food eaters beware save some time and eat elsewhere.</Text>

<text>My wife, our daughter and I were in town for the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico show at the Gallo Center for the Arts (awesome venue, stunning show), and were happy to find an IHOP near our hotel. Stopped at the restaurant (my wife's favorite breakfast place is an IHOP near our house in northern Ca.)
Service was good. My Spicy Poblano omelette was flavorful, but the cook pulled it off from the broiler too early; the results: poor cheese gratination, tepid chunks of meat and poblano chile strips.
The rest of the food was okay...I think.<//text><gmapID>0x809051744c5e6d85:0x3e60880229b0e00b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Waitress didn't check on us but to bring food. I sat for 25 minutes waiting for a new soda. Prices are high for what is served imo< /Review>

Thank you IHOP!!!! Awesome food. Had take out. Stuffed French Toast with Peaches and the Breakfast Sampler! I was very hungry and I can't wait to eat my leftovers for breakfast! IHOP has never let me down! I'm appalled at the other so-called restaurants in Modesto! Sick of getting good poisoning amongst other things! IHOP, I really hope that you read the reviews! Well done! Keep up the great work and I will remain a loyal customer! Thank you for the awesome food, service and caring! #ihopnailedit #ihoprocks #yummy #happytummy</text>

Went in around 8pm ish.. with my family. I ordered a chicken fried steak and in the first bite I took it had a bone the size of one of my teeth and tasted like it was spoiled!!! I thought to myself that maybe I bit into a bad part or something, so I took another bite from the other side and guess what not only am I sure that it is a spoiled piece of meat, but another bone!!! Nice waitress, but working by herself with too many customers leaving her stretched thin. Then after this I realize I'm overcharged $4 by the host at the register.
POOR QUALITY!! who ever owns this place needs to step up and make changes and pay attention to what's going on there.  I'm only one man, but I'm one man that will NEVER return to this place. If things don't change, more will follow.<//text>

Dont go early morning. Lots of situations where you may be uncomfortable due to people being loud or fighting. Homeless people acting foolish outside. Service is pretty weak.<//Text>

Dont go early morning. Lots of situations where you may be uncomfortable due to people being loud or fighting. Homeless people acting foolish outside. Service is pretty weak.<//review>

<text>The prices here are outrageous and they seem to want to freeze you with the air conditioning to get you to eat fast and leave. You can literally hang meat in this place. Almost $6 for 4 small chicken nuggets for a child. McDonald's has 20 for $5.</text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Decent for what it is.
Hot food, clean place, VERY respectful staff and they explain everything very well.
Only problem, very high air conditioning. Outside it was raining and when we entered we expected to take off our jackets but it was impossible; for the very icy air conditioning

(Original)
Decente para lo que es.
Comida caliente, lugar limpio, personal MUY respetuoso y te explican todo muy bien.
Único problema, aire acondicionado muy alto. Afuera llovía y al entrar esperamos sacarnos las chaquetas pero fue imposible; por el aire acondicionado  muy helado</Text>
