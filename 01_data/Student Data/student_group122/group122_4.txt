<review>For a few minutes now I've been trying to get my windshield wipers adjusted bright after they installed the motor for my wipers and took them apart. Some of the workers have great attitude! Parking lot is kind of janky, when you drive by at night you can see people hanging around the cars that are left in the parking lot I mean if you're comfortable with that then leave your car but I wasn't mine stayed in the garage for one night and I never brought it back till this day not even to get repaired from something they messed up. Spoke to the owner and he said bring it back in we'll get it right someday!<//review>< rating>

<text>Jerry R. was very professional in our dealings. He got my truck up on the rack and started work right away.
The work was finished in a timely manner and the quality was 100%

Buyer beware!!! Horrible workmanship in welding mufflers. I have taken several vehicles here and the quality and service remain the same, substandard! The owner Adrain is rude, despicable, and quite condescending. I had to replace my catalytic converters and entire muffler system again. They even welded my oxygen sensor, which caused my check engine to turn light on. Acapulco Mufflers fixed all of Lipsey's faulty work costing several hundreds of dollars.<//Text>

They can do basic tire work fine.  Be careful if they say they can handle more complicated projects.  It hasn't been my experience they can.

They also don't bother to have anyone there wear masks.  It's a covid hazard.</Text>

Lipsey's is THE best auto repair shop! They know what they are doing and I can not believe how reasonable their prices are. I and my housemates too for that matter have been taking our cars there since we moved to Vallejo 2 years ago.
And they are super friendly and go out of their way to help you.< /review>

Owner was a rude, disrespectful jerk to me. Not getting my money again. Shop is dirty and disorganized too. No bell ringer or anything when a customer shows up just two rude mechanics telling you that you can't be in their area. Never again. First rule of business: "the customer is always right"<//text>

<Text>EDIT: Not only was our car broken into but the next day my boyfriend found people sleeping in our car while walking home, either lipseys leaves cars unlocked or there are people who check out the cars late at night. id advise not to leave your car here.

they have done great work to our car in the past but after yesterdays incident we will no longer come here. our car was here for 2 weeks to get a new engine, yesterday we came to take pictures of our car to sell it and to our surprise the car was unlocked and all of our personal belongings (CDS, paperwork, tools, electronics) INCLUDING all of our car information (pink slips and all) were stolen out our car. everything was thrown around and a oil cap was gone as well, we are unsure how long our car was like this as none of the workers there knew what happened and all seemed clueless to which they told us to call the owner, nothing was resolved and said he wasnt responsible for what happened while our car was under their watch. if you do come here make sure you lock your car and take your things out. what makes this worse is we also called checking to see if our car was fine earlier in the week and they assured it was, this could of happened after the breakin but judging by how 2 doors were unlocked i doubt they were actually checking on it.< /Text>< username>

<review>Went there to get a cat back system put on and asked them to please not cut up my OEM Exhaust when taking it off sense i had a buyer all ready lined up for it. Was told that it would be no Problem to take it off without cutting or breaking the factory Exhaust "witch i know is true sense i'v seen it be done b4 on the same kind of car" Any ways they ended up cutting it into 6 parts :( and also cut some of the hangers off of my car and just discarded them. The drone from my new system ended up being to much (witch i take responsibility for sense i am the one that asked to put it on) so I ended up paying to have the factory system put back on of witch i had no choice sense i was unable to sell it and get a magnaflow or other good cat back system due to them cutting up my OEM system. So after they welded all 6 parts of my OEM Exhaust back 2gether it is now back on my car,but seems to leak a lot and makes strange sounds. I am going there in the next few days to see if they can fix the crappy welds. Will update this soon.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This place is highly recommended! The staff here know exactly what they are doing and they took care of me from beginning to end in a friendly, professional way. They were attentive to every detail during my exam, answered all questions I had, and I picked out the glasses I wanted from a good selection in their clean, well maintained office. Thanks Advanced Vision Care for putting me at ease and making everything uncomplicated..<//review>

Dr. John Holcomb is a wonderful optometrist. He’s patient, attentive, and informative. The store has a wide selection of frames from simple and affordable, to standout and luxury. One of my favorite Vision stores I’ve ever had the pleasure of being a customer at.</Text>

Our family has had Dr Tran as our Doctor for over 13 years now! To say she’s amazing is an understatement! We lived near her establishment when we our family originally started seeing (👈🏻pun intended😜), her. We moved 12 years ago from her area and tried a few doctors in the Temecula area and no thank you, she has ALWAYS been worth the drive!! Having our appointments yesterday and watching our oldest, now 22 pay for her own glasses brought back so many memories!! Our 22 year old was 9 when she first met Dr.Tran and here she was, graduated from college and paying for her own glasses 🥰 Everyone in that office is amazing! And why wouldn’t they be... They have two outstanding Doctors leading them! Dr Tran is not just our Optometrist, but I absolutely consider her a friend!! And YES, she’s most definitely that kind! Take it from us, we’ve witnessed it for over 13 years now and I’m so thankful for her and all she’s done for this family! Thank you, Dr. Tran for always going the extra mile for us and I’m sure ALL of your clients!! To have our sight in your hands is a blessing and you are truly appreciated!!</Review>

The staff is always super friendly and are always so respectful. I love their new location. It was like walking into something completely different. I love that there is a million more glasses to pick from.
Dr Holcomb is awesome! I love that he explains everything to you and never rushes through the exam. The new eye machine is freaking amazing...i was in awe on how fast and accurate my eye exam was. If you are looking for a great caring optometrist Dr Holcomb is the one!Dr Holcomb thank you.<//text>

I’ve been coming for 12 years I’ve always been attended with care, the environment itself is very clean and sanitized. Recently, the new receptionists have made my experience rather unpleasant, and the customer service is very poor & unprofessional, I’ve been coming here for so long I know they have OUTSTANDING customer service for years, but lately these wrong impressions from new hires will have an affect on regular patients.<//Review>< pictures>

I have been coming to Advanced Vision for many years.  The doctor is fantastic and he explains what is going on with your eyes in words that you can understand.  The new place where they have moved is much larger and very very clean.  They have a lot more frames to choose from prescription to sunglasses.   I would highly recommend this vision optometry for your eyes.</text>

The dr was very thorough with our exams and my husband and I were very happy. They have a huge selection of sunglasses and you don’t see that anywhere.  We will be coming back here for sure.<//review>

<text>Very knowledgeable and professional. They made the visit very pleasant, gave me straight to the point answers and answered all my questions without making me feel pressured. The receptionist are very nice and always greet you with a smile. While I was trying on glasses, I found a pair I liked she noticed the frame was a little narrow and suggested a size bigger. I have never needed glasses so I had no idea what to look for other than the style and what I thought fit me best. I’m glad she pointed that out because my glasses are super comfortable and never leave any signs of redness or sore spots from prolonged wear. They never tried to up sale anything which I absolutely hate about other companies. Thanks again I would highly recommend them to everyone looking for a new eye dr.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<text>* I do not think the person assisting me had the interest to help me at all with my vison issues rather  the experience  was more like let see how much we can get out of his pocket and out of the insurance the prices I was given were out of her head rather than prices on a piece  of paper or from the computer she  either  is very good at what she does or  in her eyes I was just another sucker.<//text>< Name>

<text>I just rented a unit from this Public Storage, so my review is for my initial experience.  The location is convenient, the facility is clean and Andres was very nice and helpful in explaining everything.  The rates at this Public Storage location seem a little cheaper than nearby competitors.  I anticipate a trouble-free experience in the future -- highly recommended.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>A great storage facility that I have been very satisfied with. Awesome deals for first time customers and spaces large enough to store anything from a single room to an entire home. I started off a medium sized unit and after many months I upgraded to one of the largest units and have not been disappointed. Great priced units and very friendly staff, I would and have recommended Public Storage to anyone looking to rent a space.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Experience has been fine but as of July 12 i was lucky enough to have stopped by my unit for an item i needed ironically enough only to find the lock on my unit had been tampered with convincing me to add another lock i dont know what good that will do but i did notice the attendant take a walk around with a note pad checking others i dont know how often they do walk throughs of the site but i also have no clue how long my lock sat there damaged.<//review>

Well for starters I was having a bad day as it was, then to think of now I have to rent a space for my things don't know what type of service I would be encountering but to my surprise the gentleman that helped me was very patient with me and my lack of knowledge with renting a space for i had lots of questions.

Thank you for your help "Oscar"<//review>

Jackie was the best. She explained everything, took me on a tour so I could easily find my unit and made the set up easy. Highly recommend this place. Customer service and a friendly staff is the key to a great organization. Keep smiling Jackie...you are the best...</review>

Amber and Josh are the most helpful customer service management I have had the pleasure to of dealing with. Change of life , not the good type, brought me to this location. My first unit was too small and the first attendant I asked about adding a second unit was not interested in helping me. The next day I came back willing to pay full price for a second unit but they offered me a larger unit making my move so much more simple. Thank you Public storage for your staff. Made my day one to smile about.<//text>

One of the better storage facilities I’ve used, pretty clean overall, don’t feel like I have to look over my shoulder when I’m there. My last storage facility was an absolute nightmare. Glad I finally made the switch.</Review>

Look at the yelp reviews, one bad review after another! The ones on here are probably written by the staff, Worst place ever and their employees don’t know anything they give you wrong info. And it’s ghetto as hell, storage units look as if you could walk through the walls, and the ceilings don’t touch the top, and I’ve heard many people say they’ve gotten robbed. Don’t go here, they try and get you and give you a great price but you pay for what you get. Just don’t. Go to west coast storage in San Pedro, they’re great, complete opposite of this cheap place. Don’t get your stuff stolen, go to a different place.< /review>

Seems like Amber is coaching for positive reviews.  I have had a horrible experoence. They let someone steal from my storage said that i was lying and made me look crazy.   Come to find out someone had been or had access for a year.  Corporate verified it. legal process now because I believe the are responsible for thousands of dollars of lost items ... The process just takes long<//review>

Former tenant sometime ago. They had shifty  skinny young Mexican employee who helped himself when I accidentally left a key in a lock. Large storage unit outside. Discovered 2 days later.  When demanding to review footage / camera was practically facing my unit /, particular timing was erased from tape!🤔👿👹 They had management in Orange County and we drove to resolve. I moved stuff  shortly after. I believe employee was scared when I said that I am notifying a police, and he probably wanted to put things back / he took what was right up front in a packed to capacity storage / -  nice travel bag with some items, Murano wall clock, small box with miscellaneous etc. But I changed lock. There was pile of gorgeous women clothing in plastic dry cleaners bags - he didn't wanted that. That's how we figured out it was male, not female who also worked there, who was a thief!</review>

Really impressed with the ease of signing up online and the efficiency of our check in. The place looks clean and well cared for and secure. It will be nice to have an insulated roof over our indoor space after storing things in an outdoor unit in Palm Springs for two years! Very happy so far.</review>

I had a wonderful experience with the ladies. Shay showed me the unit and found a unit that was perfect for me. Amber processed my rental and explained my contract thoroughly and i really appreciated the time they took out to explain how the gate works. Thanks ladies< /review>

< review>
Former tenant sometime ago. They had shifty  skinny young Mexican employee who helped himself when I accidentally left a key in a lock. Large storage unit outside. Discovered 2 days later.  When demanding to review footage / camera was practically facing my unit /, particular timing was erased from tape!🤔👿👹 They had management in Orange County and we drove to resolve. I moved stuff  shortly after. I believe employee was scared when I said that I am notifying a police, and he probably wanted to put things back / he took what was right up front in a packed to capacity storage / -  nice travel bag with some items, Murano wall clock, small box with miscellaneous etc. But I changed lock. There was pile of gorgeous women clothing in plastic dry cleaners bags - he didn't wanted that. That's how we figured out it was male, not female who also worked there, who was a thief!< /review>

This place is great! Erica, John and Amber are amazing! They totally made my day when  I went in to secure a storage facility.  They are happy, bubbly, courteous and just have amazing customer service. They make the perfect team, totally work well together. Paperwork was a breeze, smiles were a plenty during the whole process. I didn't want to leave the premesis because I felt so comfortable with these three people. Don't believe me go check them out for yourselves.<//Text>

Switched to public storage from west coast in Pedro due to cost. PS is about 70.00 cheaper for the same size unit. Got there and realized why. This PS location is run down, dirty and you take your life in your own hands when u use the elevator. Plus I DID NOT like the fact that insurance is MANDATORY. They failed to tell me that on the phone when i asked for a quote. So all in all price 4 ****  quality of location 1*.<//review>

<review>If your looking to store your personal items and are not too tech savvy but would love to pay your bill online, and hassle free? “ Speak with Shay!”  Shay is amazing, she walked me through the entire process in the most professional yet caring manner ever. I’m a  dinosaur when it comes to technology; however, Publice Storage hired the right team play for clients like myself... Thanks Shay!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I usually do not write reviews but the customer service here compelled me to, so here goes nothing lol. Amber is a storage Expert to say the least I told her I was in a time crunch and her and her partner Shay still managed to be thourough but yet brief. Amber answered all of my questions and satisfied all of my concerns. The smiling ladies greeted me with amazing customer service, processed my rental with remarkable professionalism and managed to get me in the perfect space. At first I was skeptical about going through this transition but the team at this location made everything so easy. If you’re in the area and you need a unit come here and ask for Amber ! The team here is great !<//Text><response>None<//response><userid>114653161252640504442<//userid><Rate>5< /Rate><GmapID>0x80dd358366c33103:0x90fed776c6674d9d<//GmapID><name>Kieth B.</name><date>1518919609229< /date>< pics>

From the beginning, manager Shay provided amazing customer service. She promptly called me to confirm my appointment and was very professional. Once I got to the facility Shay helped me find the right size for an amazing price. The light bulb in the unit did not work but Shay told me that wouldn't be an issue she would get that fixed for me as soon as possible. Ray was also at the faculty during my sign up and he was able to answer any questions that I had. These two are the Dinamic Duo! I had reservations about coming to rent at public storage, but with these two at the property I am confident my items will be protected and my future visits to the facility will be just as friendly and professional as the first. I would recommend this storage facility to anyone. Any one whose ever moved knows this process is very stress ful ...Thanks for the friendly smile, helping me find my unit and making the process less stressful Shay !</text>

Their policies are very questionable from the outset and the customer service after you've rented is sub par to say the very least. The women that work there are disaffected and wholly uninterested in making any effort to communicate effectively or with and "customer service" whatsoever. I regret renting from this public storage facility and will be glad to vacate my property from them as soon as is possible.< /Text>

#1 - tenant for only 4 months, just got a 16% rent increase.
#2 - move out date is one week into the month but they will NOT pro-rate the rent, insist on the full month whether we are there or not.  Contrary to this policy they pro-rated the move in expense however.
#3 - because of #1&2 I'm done with them.  Never again.<//review>

I recently moved from las vegas and in need of a storage unit until my place is ready for me to move in. I've called around and after speaking to Angel on the phone I went in to see him .The place was well kept and found that Angel was even more helpful with all my concerns in person and I also got a very good price!</text>

< Review>
Terrible customer service over the phone. There are severe inconsistencies with policy information. Customer care will direct you to speak with the same employees that told you to speak with customer care in the first place. Their tactics are textbook "run the customer around and they'll pay or quit". The district manager, Rafael Diaz, did not look into my complaint. He only called to tell me he wasn't going to do anything. My experience is down below. I am currently trying to get in contact with the senior district manager.

I moved into my new apartment on the 2nd of this month and wanted to get my things. If you have never used PS before, their rental agreement states you are not entitled to a prorated refund if you choose to terminate rental. I do not have automated payment set up because i was going to move into my place one the 1st of this month but it ended up being the 2nd. The month of April is to this day not paid for with PS. I called them on the 2nd to ask how much moving out would cost and was told that PS no longer prorated and I owe for a full month. While I was at work, (still the 2nd), I called PS again to ask where in my agreement did it say I'm not entitled to a prorate and was told "we just don't do that anymore, you can try set a move out date online and see if it charges you". I sent my approved access member in to the office and they told him I didn't have a unit there. The next day, I called the district manager and left a message and recalled the customer care number. Jaculyn let me know that PS gives a two day prorate. She was confused as to why I was told different. Now that it is four days later and they've kept me out of my unit since the 2nd, PS is saying I won't get the two day prorate.< /Review>

<Review>Sold my home..moved into an apartment for 15 months while looking for another home. When I came to remove my things,I noticed my locks were cut off,and new locks were installed,and most of my expensive items missing. Probably an inside job. Not happy :(<//Review>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) I consider the service of this place 5 stars. I needed a smaller unit because the other one I had was already in the middle. Angel and Jenny looked after me very well. They could get me another different smaller unit to also save me money and they gave me one that was very close to my other unit, so now I am happy with my new unit and the money that saved me. Yenny, Angel and Deserie are always very professional and pleasant. Thanks guys.

El servicio de este local lo considero 5 estrellas. Yo necesitaba una unidad mas pequena por que la otra que tenia ya estaba a la mitad. Angel y yenny me atendieron muy bien me pudieron conseguir otra diferente unidad mas pequena para tambien ahorrarme dinero y me dieron una que estaba muy cerca de mi otra unidad asi que ahora ya estoy contento con mi nueva unidad y el dinero que me ahorro. Yenny, Angel y deserie siempre son muy profesionales y agradables. Gracias muchachos.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I'm satisfied with the service they give me. I feel safe my things are safe and the service they give yenny and deserie and angel always very nice. The town is always clean and they also have trolleys to move heavy things that if they do not have little devils they have to bring theirs. My unit is on the second floor but it is easy because they also have 3 elevators. It is a local very close to the freeway and also have enough parking inside you do not have to wait for that. In general I am happy my things are safe.

Estoy sastifecha con el servicio que me dan. Me siento segura mis cosas estan seguras y el servicio que dan yenny y deserie y angel siempre muy agradables.

Mi unidad esta en el segundo piso pero es facil porque tambien tienen 3 elevadores. Es un local muy cerca del freeway y tambien tienen suficiente parqueo adentro no hay que esperarse por eso. En general estoy contenta mis cosas estan seguras.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>(Translated by Google) The Yenny and wish girls are very pretty and very polite. I like to always greet one even if we don't go to the office. Also, every time I need to borrow a cart, they never give a bad face to you and that is very good, not all businesses find people like that and even knowing that we are the customers and those who bring their business to them but these are many An example. Keep it that way and go far.

(Original)
La muchachas Yenny y deseree son bien lindas y muy educadas. Me gusta que siempre lo saludan a uno aunque no vayamos a la oficina. Tambien cada vez que necesito que me presten un carrito nunca le dan la mala cara a uno y eso es muy bueno no todos los negocios se encuentran personas asi y aun sabiendo que somos nosotros los clientes y los que les traemos su negocio pero estas muchas son un ejemplo. Que siguan asi y llegaran muy lejos.</Text></record>

Cool drink selection, but I think that if they could bring back the Arizona Green Tea & Lemonade combo drinks they used to have a few years ago they'd be golden! Staff has been pretty cool based off the times I've been in there.< /text>

It's not a big place but it's a huge part of the community that lives within walking distance, and they're all known to the employees by first name. The word family is not usually how one describes a liquor store's atmosphere but it (odd as it may be) fits in this case. Drinks are ice cold, good selection of things and they cash checks.< /text>

place was very Clean.  Gentleman who was working there was Very Respectful and courteous and helpful.  And the prices are Great.  And they have the kind of cigarette tubes I like.  Out of the 6 smoke shop I have been to they are the only ones that have the correct menthol tubes with the white filter tips. Making this Smoke Shop my Favorite.< /Text>

I always try to go while Marcus is working. He's always so friendly and gives great advice on which products to use. Tried a few other smoke shops but this one is the best one by far. Don't live in the area anymore but I definitely don't mind the drive because I know I'll only have to make one stop and done.</review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>They were opening up late so I called and got hung up on. Tried again 15 minutes later and the same thing happened. You think they'd give a simple explanation instead of just hanging up on a customer giving no explanation for when they were opening so I could just come back. They're probably in the back getting high. You'd think a smoke shop that's losing business despite having such an ideal location would at least attempt to have better customer service. I guess that goes hand in hand with their small overpriced unimpressive selection of glass pipes. I'll drive to the next shop from now on.< /Review>< pictures>

We had a private party for my nephew's 15th birthday. We has the entire place to ourselves. Everyone had a blast!!! I loved that we were able to sit in the waiting area and see everything going on.<//text>

I've been working here for over two years now and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Staff is respectful to each other and to customers, making it a very positive work environment. The kids and adults I have in my classes always have a blast, and I love being able to teach them new skills every week.< /Text>

Love this gym. If your kid loves gymnastics but struggles with the strict dogma that is organized gymnastics tempest is the place for them. They still have structure to keep you safe but they allow and encourage exploration of movement and what you want to explore.<//Review>

<text>This is the place where young children can learn new skills and have a wonderful time.

It is amazing to see how quickly the kids learn new ways to get over obstacles quickly.  They also learn how to fall without getting hurt.

If you or your children like to have fun running, climbing and jumping, this is the place to go.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1552341579892, 'text': 'Thank you so much Roger, we greatly appreciate your awesome support!'}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc751dee51cbb1:0x58ac7c4489908ab9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I’ve always wanted to come to tempest to train here because it’s such an amazing facility and has everything you would need to train in: Super tramps, bars, ledges, pads, walls, and even a foam pit. I went here today and I definitely would come back, only if I could. I wish that tempest could expand their complex, and reach out to other cities (Dallas :)
Besides that I  enjoyed the class I took here...I forgot the instructors name, I think it was Anthony or Christian, not sure, he taught a green band class, but anyways super chill staff and overall the whole place had a great vibe<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This place parkour trains for one hour before free running! First train is free! Free run is $20!  Training is at 10am or 11am! Free running is from 12pm to 230!  It's great to experience it if you like to jump, climb,flip and roll!<//review>

Great place to go with your kids. First Class is free but after it costs a lot for classes< /Text>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>I’m disappointed in their class move up policy. They stick your kid in a class below their skill level until you pay for a separate test not on their class day and only scheduled every 6 weeks unless you want to pay $50 for a private test.This extra cost and class is no where in their pricing info on their website. The class prior to the test the coach goes over all the skills with s check list so why not test then? My daughters gymnastics tests during class and is part of the normal cost. If they are just trying to make extra money then charge more for the classes. I was told that my son would not be learning any new “curriculum” or be challenged until he takes the test which in 16 weeks, the only $20 test that has been scheduled, fell on Mother’s Day. Unfortunately they are the only place like this in the area. We may stay for that reason but not because we are happy.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I was visiting California for the very first time and I'd been wanting to go to tempest with my kids for a long time. My kids were having a great time but about 45 minutes in my daughter got hurt. She fell off of a ramp and broke two bones in her wrist. Tempest is not a place for little kids. It is a place for talented parkour and freerunning.< /Text>

<Review>Tempest is a large playground for adults and teens. There is a large trampoline, a spring floor, and a couple obstacle courses. They have classes for kids, as well as homeschool hours.< /Review>< Pics>

It was a fair visit.  Although they have a sign posted saying  "no mask no service" the gentleman in line in front of me was not wearing one still got served. I believe cuz he knew the employees. Other than that, the line moved fast.</Text>

Watch your receipt totals. Colored glass was considered scrap. I was not given credit for it. Out of 25lbs, I had 2 or 3 wine bottles, the rest were beer bottles. Being my first time there, I even asked if the glass needed to be seperated. I was not advised about the wine bottles not being recyclable.  They lost my business. Not ever going back.< /Review>

They are open and PACKED TO THE MAX!! Emptying out containers very fast. There's a line waiting for containers but they are working "rapido". .

Low pay plus they need figure print to pay out $8? When the guy point to scan my fingers I though it was because I was going to receive more then $20 but either way  I didn't like the fact that they scan my Id and finger print me plus ask for signature as if it was a big something major never going back I feel like my identity has been violated dont even feel recycling anymore< /review>

We highly recommend Nisson Orthodontic!  Years ago Dr. Nisson turned our daughter's overcrowded teeth into a lasting beautiful smile.  He was our 1st choice when our grandson needed treatment for his overbite.  Dr. Nisson goes above and beyond to ensure excellent results for his patients.  He thoroughly explains his treatment plan and works hard to keep everyone on track.  Everyone on the Nisson Orthodontics' Team is very friendly, organized, professional and knowledgeable. Any scheduling change, question, or emergency need was always handled quickly and efficiently.   Thank you all, for your outstanding care and results!!< /review>

I love Dr. Nisson Orthodontics. The staff is the most amazing team I have ever experienced. I have been going to them for years . The balance between personal attention, professional attitude and down home service is beyond expectations of any kind.  Let me tell you I’m not always a good patient to deal with. I have a crazy schedule. Most of the time I have to bring my kid with me. They always make it work. Great people, great service, outstanding results.

Love this place...</text>

<rate>5</rate><review>Dr.Nisson is an excellent orthodontist. He will accommodate all your needs as a patient. As a college student with a very busy schedule, he was able to make sure that there was always a time for an appointment. In terms of his expertise, he is very knowledgeable in a variety of areas within orthodontics from straight teeth to healthy breathing and airways. I plan on possibly being in the dental field after my undergrad and with the knowledge I have it seems Dr.Nisson is using some of the latest and greatest techniques such as Skeletal Expansion and Indirect Bonding. Overall I am very impressed with every aspect of the experience from the quality of the treatment to the extremely friendly and accommodating staff.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1579498473792, 'text': 'Thank you so much, Fouad!'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x809af9fe86539163:0x572e6f27e03a8dd9</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Dr. Nisson is a great orthodontics. The Staff is wonderful and always make you feel at home. My daughter says that Dr Nisson was kind and always explained what she needed to do to take care of her teeth while preparing to get her braces. Today was the day the braces were removed. My daughter is extremely happy with her new smile and confidence.  All thanks to Dr Nisson and Staff. Nisson Orthodontics is our #1 stop for orthodontic care.
Thank You  Team Nisson</text>< Resp>

<username>Jessica Book< /username><Review>Dr. Nisson and his staff went over and above for me as a patient. I am so pleased with the outcome from the services they provided! My teeth look beautiful!

Dr. Nisson and his staff made themselves available to meet my orthodontic needs at all times if necessary. I could contact the doctor outside of office hours if I had an issue with my braces and would be seen right away if needed. When I arrived for my appointments, they rarely made me wait. Scheduling was never a problem either. I always felt cared for by everyone at Dr. Nisson's office. The services provided were top quality!

I highly recommend Dr. Nisson for all your orthodontic work!

Thank you Dr. Nisson and Staff!

I cant say enough about Dr. Nisson and his staff!   I knew about him for years as he helped us straighten out some issues one of our daughters had when she was 12 or 13. Then at 58 years old, it was time to get my smile straightened out. I went in for a consultation, Dr. Nisson brought forward a plan that seemed reasonable to me in every way.  Eighteen months later I'm finished with the braces and wow, I have to get used to actually smiling as I've been self conscious of my crooked teeth since Junior High. Dr. Nisson and his staff made me feel like family during the entire process. I'm going to miss them!    Thank You Dr. Nisson, Michele, Kathy, Barbara, and Abby! You all made it fun!.< /text>

I had a great experience with Dr. Nisson. I have sucked my thumb all my life and have had crooked teeth my entire life. I don't have a really great "before" picture because I never let anyone see my teeth before braces. But now even after almost a year after braces I still love my teeth! Dr. Nisson is really nice and he always smells great! I was able to make payments and I am so happy with  the results.<//text>

< Review>
I highly recommend Dr. Nisson as a knowledgeable and skilled professional orthodontist.  I had consultations with three different orthodontists and Dr. Nisson was the obvious choice for me.  He took the time to really evaluate my child/son and plan out what would need to be done.  He was fairly priced and the office is centrally located.  Dr. Nisson is down to earth and easy to communicate with.  I asked my son what he thought about Dr. Nisson and his reply was “He knows what he’s doing and he’s quick”.  Dr. Nisson and his staff are efficient, understanding and super friendly.<//Review>

Dr. Nisson is gentle, thorough, kind, funny, communicative, helpful, and extremely good at what he does.  Over five years ago he designed a plan for my daughter that helped us to understand the process that he would go through with her. When the braces came off, she had a gorgeous smile! His staff is friendly and helpful. I am very glad that we chose him for her orthodontist.</Review>

<review>Dr. Nisson and his staff did an amazing job on my son's teeth. Ronny had an overcrowded mouth of teeth and I was really wondering if he could have a  straight set of teeth. The reasons I like Dr. Nisson is he took his time(son was impatient as any teenager) and did it right. The office was more than fair in taking payments the whole time. The office also has a very friendly staff that always gave a reminder call and is always working with you for payment and not against you. Thank you! I believe in the long run Ronny will always have a great looking smile and its really awesome seeing Ronny love his new smile with no braces! Great job Dr. Nisson and staff! We appreciate you guys! Sincerely, Ron</review>< Pictures>

<review>The Team at Nisson Orthodontics is without question the most cohesive and complete team I've ever experienced in a dental environment.  The balance between personal attention, professional attitude and down home service is beyond expectations of any kind.  Beyond all that the "product" that is delivered is custom tailored to the individual where great pride is taken by the results by both patient as well as provider.  Great people, great service, outstanding results.<//review><Time>1487873269402<//Time>< user_name>

We have been seeing Dr. Nisson for 7 years, since our daughter was 6 years old, and went through 2 phases of orthodontic treatment.  Dr. Nisson shaped our daughter's jaw as it was growing, crafting out the perfect space for her teeth in phase 1.  Having this early intervention was critical to her lifelong dental health, allowing her keep more teeth while properly aligning her jaw.  In phase 2 (braces), he balanced her teeth for a beautiful smile and a precise bite.  He spent several months at the end making sure her smile was exact - something other orthodontics wouldn't do.
Our daughter's smile is simply gorgeous.  I am so thankful we were referred to Dr. Nisson and choose his quality treatment over a cheap orthodontic chain.  Dr. Nisson's office is simply the best orthodontic care - I will be sending all my friends his way.
Thank you Dr. Nisson and staff for an amazing orthodontic experience!<//review><user_name>Kim Horn<//user_name>< Pics>

<Review>Dr. Nisson and his staff are amazing! I had the best experience here from day one. Everybody was always so nice and positive, even about the painful parts of braces! If I ever needed anything, they did the best they could to fit me in and fix what ever it was. If I ever needed anything to do with my braces again, this would be the first place I go. More than pleased with my experience here.

<review>My daughter's teeth are beautiful!  We are about 1 month away from her braces coming off and I can't praise enough the experience we've had with Dr. Nisson and his staff.  From flexible scheduling, transparency and education about procedures, to competitive pricing, we're very happy. See Dr. Nisson if braces are in your/your child's future.< /review>< pictures>

My entire family has gone to Dr. Nisson for orthopedic procedures and we love his work. The entire staff is kind, professional and always available when you have a question.

Dr. Nisson takes the time to know his patients and goes above and beyond. He even provides his personal phone number if an emergency arises.

I highly recommend Nisson Orthodontics.< /review>

A long long time ago, about what seems like fifteen year's ago.. I went to doctor Nissan's for a healthy smile. Present day after all their hard work at the office I can smile proudly. I'd highly recommend anyone in need of an understanding and skilled orthodontist to these guys.< /Review>

<Text>Three of us now have been patients of Dr. Nisson, including two teenagers with traditional braces and an adult with Invisalign.  Dr. Nisson is friendly, professional, and extremely knowledgeable. He is always thinking ahead, making adjustments in preparation for the next step.  He is also patient with teenagers who occasionally break a bracket by absentmindedly biting on hard candy (oops!)  :-) He takes the time to go beyond a "good" result, and works to fine tune your bite to achieve the best result possible for the long term.  His pricing is competitive, his office staff is lovely, and all of his assistants are just incredible!</Text><date>1440685792547< /date><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

When I first came to Dr. Nisson my teeth were a disaster. I went through two rounds of braces and head gear. It was all worth it because now I get complimented on my "perfect" teeth quite often. I even lost my retainer over a year ago and haven't worn one since and my teeth are still perfect and straight. Dr. Nisson and his staff put in the effort to make your teeth flawless and the results stick. The staff is also super friendly and after all these years they still remember their customers.

<review>I went to Dr. Nisson when I was younger and he did a wonderful job straightening my teeth with regular braces! He did such a great job that my brother even had braces from Dr. Nisson and I even went back to him this year because I wasn't the best patient and stopped wearing my retainer so my teeth slightly shifted (wear your retainer, people!).

This year, Dr. Nisson ended up applying lingual braces (behind my teeth) and I loved it. I had several consultations this time around with orthodontists in the Sacramento area (which was closer to where I lived), but none of them compared to Dr. Nisson. I work in Davis and Dr. Nisson did such a great job with my brother and I that I drove all the way to Cameron Park (about an hour drive) for my lingual braces.

He pays attention to the little details and explains things very well to his patients. He goes above and beyond to give the best treatment to his patients and the staff members at Dr. Nisson's office are also great! They were all so friendly and helpful and they made the whole experience even better.

I'm loving my smile thanks to Dr. Nisson!!< /review>< Pics>

<review>Oh goodness, so many fond memories of Doctor Nisson! I remember getting lectured every single visit for not brushing my teeth well enough. It worked however, because when my braces finally came off, my teeth were stainless and straight!

Four years later, I'm off to college and I still love my new smile! I had my braces off by the time they promised, I had minimal discomfort with my braces, and the retainers are made to last. Doctor Nisson is known as the king of orthodontics in El Dorado County and is probably one of the best in all of Northern California.

5/5 would recommend if looking to have a perfect smile.<//review>< response>

<Text>If you need your teeth straightened, don't go to anyone but Dr. Nisson.  He is simply the best -- knowledgeable, friendly & spends a lot of time explaining everything that will be done during the course of treatment.  At my initial consultation, he spent well over an hour showing me pictures & going through the whole process.  His entire office staff is terrific, the environment is one of warmth and respect for one another, and I love the music they play!  You will also get a kick out of Dr. Nisson's laugh which you will hear often.

I have just come out of braces and my teeth are amazing I think; I am overjoyed with the results.  Thank you, Dr. Nisson & everyone in your office for making this experience a positive one.

Dr. Nisson has treated three of my five children, and I highly recommend him.  I feel that Dr. Nisson is honest and does not push treatments that are unnecessary or only for cosmetic purpose.  I am extremely happy with the outcome of each of my children's treatments, which ranged from minor retainer work to full braces.  His entire staff is friendly, professional, conscientious, and fun.  The office itself is clean, pleasant, and comfortable for both adults and children, with good seating, plenty of toys and reading materials, and my personal favorite---a coffee break room!  I am extremely satisfied with every aspect of care that my family has received at Dr. Nisson's office and give him and his entire team two enthusiastic thumbs up!< /Text>

<review>My daughter and I have been very pleased with Dr. Nisson and his staff. We have both commented on several occasions, after leaving his office, that we are so glad we picked Dr. Nisson. It was not easy for me to decide on which treatment option to pick for my daughter's teeth. I researched several competent orthodontists prior to picking Dr. NIsson and there were some differences of opinion on the best treatment option for her particular situation.  Once my husband and I sat down and talked to Dr. Nisson about the different options, I felt much more at ease about a treatment plan and was ready to move forward. Along the way, Dr. NIsson was always willing to answer questions and continued to be informative as to her progress.He was thoughtful, honest and competent in his care. Dr. Nisson's staff were always friendly, informative and helpful.  My daughter now has her braces off. She has a beautiful smile as she always has had, but with straight teeth! Thank you Dr. Nisson and staff!< /review>< userid>

<Name>Adam Sauer<//Name><time>1461085223930</time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>As a pre-med college student with minimal income and a hectic schedule, I needed a skilled orthodontist who was both affordable and flexible with my busy schedule.

I met several orthodontists throughout the El Dorado Hills, Folsom, and Roseville area. Out of all the orthodontists I met and consultations I attended, Dr. Nisson was BY FAR the most caring and professional.  I had a few other orthodontists try and sway me into choosing them by tempting me with much less "brace time" than I actually needed - and although these enticing offers seemed very practical in the short-run, it wouldn't have been as beneficial. The consultations with other orthodontists were far from enjoyable - they glanced at my teeth for a few minutes, gave me an estimate on total price and time, dismissed me to their front desk staff, and rushed on to their next patient.

Upon arriving at Dr. Nisson's office, I was kindly greeted by him and his amiable staff. Dr. Nisson carefully examined my teeth for a fair amount of time. He then took complementary x-rays and photographs of my bite in order to see how he was going to approach my specific needs. Within a few days, I received a typed letter in the mail from him with a detailed description of the problems he found with my teeth - a few gaps, shifted molars, crowding, etc. He then explained his recommendation and particular plan of action. NO OTHER ORTHODONTIST TOOK THE TIME TO DO THIS FOR ME!!! At this point, I decided to give Nisson Orthodontics a shot.

I explained my given financial problem, which he completely understood. He offered me a great deal on upper ceramics (the clear white braces way less obvious) and metal ones on my bottom teeth. The personal payment plan was easily doable. I had great experiences every visit with him and his awesome staff for the next 18 months. Honestly, I'm really going to miss seeing them!

Dr. Nisson and Staff, I can't thank you guys enough for all that you've done. It's been a week since I've had my braces off and I'm continually getting compliments on my perfect smile. I've never felt so confident and happy. I'm forever grateful!

All in all, I will highly recommend Dr. Nisson to any of my friends and family, and to any of you reading this. Don't settle for mediocrity...choose an orthodontist that genuinely cares about you!!!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1461090425537, 'text': 'Thanks for the very kind words, Adam.

<time>1432702162990< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Ever since my permanent teeth started growing in, I've felt self-conscious about my smile. My friends and family tried to assure me that there was nothing wrong with my teeth, and my own dentist told me, "If you were my daughter, I'd tell you to learn to love your teeth," when I suggested getting cosmetic corrections. When I had a consultation with Dr. Nisson, he told me not only the exact improvements he could make to my smile, but the explanations as to why my teeth had twisted and shifted over the years into what I had come to accept in the mirror. It was because of Dr. Nisson's honesty, direct approach, and warm bedside manor that I decided to get braces.

This was a big decision for me, because I was not a teenager being brought into an orthodontist's office by my well-meaning parents. I was now a young adult, having hated my smile for ten years, and I decided to give myself braces as a birthday present in hopes that I'd like what I saw in the mirror for once. From the beginning, Dr. Nisson was clear and patient with me as I asked innumerable questions and 'what if's' about the before, during, and after process of wearing braces. He always gave me his full attention, and his staff were prompt and thorough with responding to my many phonecalls throughout the year.

Personally, I did not find wearing braces a hardship, or even very painful. When they came off, on May 28th, 2013, I became a new person. I didn't just have a beautiful new smile. I had confidence and pride.

In almost two years of enjoying my beautiful new smile, I have had no problems or reversals. I have returned several times to Dr. Nisson's office, but only to order and pick up additional retainers, and of course for hugs and smiles--I never resist a chance to show off my pearly whites! During every return visit, everyone in the office has been glad to see me, and Dr. Nisson still gives me his full attention for any little 'what if' question I may have. I can't recommend Dr. Nisson highly enough, and I thoroughly encourage anyone who has yearned for self-esteem reflected in their smile to make an appointment for a consultation. It just might change your life.</Text>< pics>

<review>After several consultations with orthodontists in the past, I was left with proposed treatment plans that included removing one or more of my bottom teeth to address severe overcrowding.  I had all but given up on the idea that I would some day enjoy a mouth full of aesthetically pleasing teeth (all 32, minus my wisdom teeth!) then, I met Dr. Nisson!  During those initial consultations, Dr. Nisson assured me that I COULD have the smile and alignment that I had hoped for without removing teeth and as they say, the rest is history!

Certainly, you would be hard pressed to find someone that said they liked having braces but I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Dr. Nisson and the wonderful staff at Nisson Orthodontics.  From the warm greetings from Barbara and Abby at the front desk to the expert care from the Assistants Jill and Michelle, and the exceptional attention to detail of Dr. Nisson, I'm convinced I received the best treatment available in El Dorado County!

I wish to thank Dr. Nisson and everyone at Nisson Orthodontics for the tremendous work they are doing and a special "Thank You" to Dr. Cynthia Russell, DDS for recommending Dr. Nisson!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Tonight's dinner and experience was truly great. I loved the wait staff and the owner came out to greet us and was such a nice man. I had a squid ink risotto that was to die for. My friend had the octopus and she loved it. We sat outside on a beautiful evening under the heat lamps and had an enjoyable time interacting with people walking by and the diners coming out. It gave us a warm, neighborhood feeling 😀< /Text>

Such authentic setting, food and service.  You feel like you've walked into a wonderfully special, intimate restaurant in Rome or Florence, with unpainted wood trim around windows and doors and warm wall decor.  All the servings are what I can only call succulent: moist, luscious, fresh.  And all of the servers and back up staff make you feel like you're the most important person in the room.  I LOVE this place...so lucky to have it here in SF.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Had 4 items, all superb.  The memories from our last trip to SF have consolidated to very few, this restaurant being one of them.  Make a reservation early and enjoy the experience of a unique, Italian American, family run, small, scratch restaurant serving properly fresh and fundamentally prepared food.  Don't let the awkward bathroom or curt staff throw you off, it is a great time.<//Review>< Resp>

<Text>I never thought I would actually write a review for my wonderful dining experience eating Octopus..lol..But what a wonderful meal! My dish arrived at my table hot and fresh and full of flavor. TO be honest I did not know what to expect as this was my first foray into this type of dish..but so glad I took the plunge.

The waitstaff were on point and knew their menu items back to front. They were friendly and efficient. We will be back soon!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Between 5 pm and 6 pm is prixe fix time. Great bargain just because you can pick any dessert.  Big bowl of soup or salad (caesar salad with a pinch of crab meat). Entree choices: salmon, pork chop, pasta. Salmon looked great and taste great.  Just simple.  My pasta had good fresh mushroom and thick tomato sauce.  Pappardelle.   My panna cotta was smooth with mango sauce.  Intense chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato for those chocolate lovers.</Review>

<review>Delicious gumbo! We ordered the grits and shrimp, the fried chicken, gumbo, and a couple of bloody which all were good but the stand out for us was the gumbo. We were expecting a long wait because of other reviewer comments, yet it only took 15 min...score. The restaurant is very tight, but that was fine with us we actually got to know our table neighbors. The service was great and fast. Prices are reasonable, too.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

What a great restaurant. Great food, friendly staff and attentive management. Capannina has a vast array of wines and Italian food. Dined here last night and I was not disappointed. Cioppino was divine and well worth the price, and it's not even expensive for the serving you get. Strongly recommended!!!<//text>

<name>AdrianO< /name><Date>1549566777181<//Date><rate>2< /rate><review>Let me start from the end. I saw the manager throughout dinner speak to multiple tables, never came to our table. We were in back corner tucked away, which was ok. At end of our dinner I caught him gesturing toward our table then he came with the check. Didn't ask if we needed anything else. I asked in a somewhat joking manner, "where you been all night, you never came by our table to ask how we are doing". He didnt really have a reply. Came back with a pitcher of water, NO THANKS! So you rush us to get out after we spend over $150 for just the two of us. Wine, appetizer, dinner and dessert. The food was good and service prior to the manager was nice.</review>< pictures>

Terrific little neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The owners typically behind the bar and the food it authentic and delicious with a nice selection of Italian wines.  Its a small restaurant so seating is limited although I have eaten at the bar several times without problem.  Very friendly staff.  Perfect for a date night.<//review>

Solid food and wine.. pasta with white wine and clams is a benchmark dish and it did not disappoint.  Crowded and the staff was misleading about the wait, but eventually it occurred to them that they could set up another table on the wide sidewalk and seat us and so that worked.</Text>

This place is amazing.  I live about 3 blocks away and my girlfriend want to try every restaurant on Union street but 80% of the time we go here because it is always more than excellent, it's fantastic!  Absolutely recommend it...and it has a GREAT Italian waiter that could not be duplicated...even in Italy.  You need to visit  If you are lucky enough to get there before 6, they have a terrific $30 prix fix. You need to to.<//Text>

<Text>I usually don't write reviews but this restaurant gets an exception. The Gnocchi is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend it. As a picky eater at most Italian restaurants, I'm impressed. Creamy, amazing texture and the flavor or the lobster and crab isn't overwhelming. Must have!</Text>< pics>

<Text>Short menu of choices of fairly classic Italian dishes. Nice wine list with unusually fair prices. Overall, the food was good, above average, but not notable. I wouldn't go back, but I wouldn't avoid this place. A couple of notes, dined at 6pm and they told us they had run out of mozzarella, also, they only offer Moretti beers. Service was fine. Decor was pleasant, a small, intimate restaurant with about a dozen tables.< /Text>< pics>

A lovely restaurant with old style service and contemporary cuisine. It's cozy with an outdoor section. They really care about the service and are happy to explain every fantastic dish. Even a basic like the Tuscan chicken is wonderfully juicy and flavorful.< /Review>

<review>Very disappointing from start to finish, the waiter was rude, didn’t listen to our order, the food was average at best, the owner/manager ignored us. And to top it all the bill arrived with 20% tip added before we had an option to choose our tip. When we pointed this out the manager disappeared and never came near us. Overall a bad experience.<//review>< name>

I had the mixed seafood grill and it was some of the best fish I had ever had in my life, though I didn't care for the risotto it came with. We even splurged for dessert which we never do and it was amazing as well. Definitely check it out if you're in the mood for authentic Italian and wine.<//Text>< pics>

My friends and I got judged when we requested a table. Waiter asked if we had reservations, which we didn't, and then proceeded to look up and down at us. Like many of the other reviews (on Google/Yelp), they clearly still had room after an hour, as we went somewhere else to eat and walked past this restaurant after we were done. Not service-oriented.< /text>

We were visiting the area with our daughter and met up with an old friend of hers for a wonderful meal at Capannina. It was recommended by a relative, a regular here, who lives in the area, and I have to say it even exceeded the high expectations that she had set. From the moment we walked in we felt at home and sat in a very comfortable table in the front window. Our waiter(s) were fantastic, engaging and attentive, but not over-the-top by any stretch...just perfect. The food was superb and one of the best meals, from start to finish, that I can remember. I had the Seared Black Pepper Crusted Rare Ahi Tuna over Spicy Prawn Risotto, and while I’m sure that all of the food is excellent (as others at my table would attest), if you go here, have the Ahi Tuna…it is a close-your-eyes-tune-out-the-world-savor-every-bite-and-let-your-taste-buds-use-all-sensory-resources kind of meal. I tend to eat too fast, but with this meal I made a very conscious effort to slow down and enjoy it…and I surely did. If we lived in this area, I’d want to go to Capannina every week.< /review>

Wonderful,  wonderful Italian resturant,  it small quaint and NOT A CHAIN restaurant.  The Food is wonderful and the service is amazing.  A resturant the locals go to, away from all the madness on Fishermans wharf.
Very reasonably priced, for the food and service you get to enjoy.<//text>

Fantastic!

Had three courses here and all were great.   Crab Cesar was delish, and the real standout was the buffala mozzarella ravioli.  Amazing!  The pistachio creme caramel was good, but overshadowed by the chocolate gelato that came with.  Also their espresso was creamy and so good!

To top it off, the service was really fabulous.  Couldn’t have asked for better!<//review>

Really good food but only decent service. I came here in a group of 8 (we had reservations) and were seated promptly, but we were still there for over 2 hours - and didn't even order dessert! It was fine because we were in a big group with a lot to talk about, but I knocked off a star for what felt like SLIGHTLY less service than I would have liked. I got the mussels for an appetizer (wish I had gotten the lobster caesar salad because that was SOOOO good) and their new red wine reduction and ravioli as the entree.

They had pretty good wine selection although I didn't drink any (had just spent the day in Napa). I will definitely be back, but am hoping for better service next time!< /review>

The food is always tasty. Their Salmon dish is amazing as well as the papadelle with ragu sauce. The soup of the day is superb and the dessert is to die for. The warm chocolate cake with gelato and pana cotta is always a winner.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

A bit cramped and loud inside, but depending on what kind of night our you're having, it could be a good fit.  They have a "bar", but it's mainly a place to park while you're waiting for a table, since there's only room at it for like 2-3 people.  Food selection was great, and everything we tried tasted excellent -- not mention the prices were pretty reasonable.  Would definitely come back here again.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) What a good place to eat. The attention by the owner is excellent. sensational food. We tried the soup of the pumpkin day with crab that was sensational. A very good spaghetti with clams. The meat ravioli in wine sauce was the best dish. A shrimp risotto and ax callus that was exquisite. The wines they offer are very good. It is a good option for Italian food. Curious detail, the owner asked me to leave the soup plate clean, using a bread as a "skater" attached photo as the plate was

Un espagueti con almejas muy bueno. Los ravioles de carne en salsa de vino era el mejor plato. Un risotto de camarones y callo de hacha que estaba exquisito.  Los vinos que ofrecen son muy buenos. Es una buena opción para comida italiana. Detalle curioso, el dueño me  pidió que dejara el plato de la sopa limpio, usando un pan como "patinador" se anexa foto como quedó el plato< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) This restaurant is recommended by Marie-Joëlle Parent in her book "300 reasons suede San Francisco". So we tried it. The service is very courteous and friendly. The menu is simple but diverse and the food is exquisite. The only problem is the à la carte price. I do not think it is too expensive for the quality and quantity of what it eats but the total of the bill will still remain high. However, it is possible to eat in a 3-course table d'hôte between 5 and 6 p.m. for only $ 30. If you are in the area, it is worth the detour. 👍

Ce resto est recommandé par Marie-Joëlle Parent dans son livre "300 raisons daim San Francisco". Donc nous l'avons essayé. Le service est très courtois et sympathique. Le menu est simple mais diversifié et la nourriture est exquise. Le seul hic c'est le prix à la carte. Je ne crois pas que ce soit trop dispendieux pour la qualité et la quantité de ce que la y mange mais le total de la facture restera quand même élevée. Il est toutefois possible de manger en table d'hôte 3 services entre 17 et 18h pour seulement 30$. Si vous êtes dans le coin, ça vaut le détour. 👍<//review>< Rate>

<text>I physically went to the shop and thought we’d made arrangements for my daughter’s first tattoo after speaking to two guys there. I was told to leave my name, number, and date/time we wanted to get the tattoos, and the guy who would do them (who I was speaking to) would text me that evening. He didn’t so I called three days later to follow up. The guy who answered the phone was unbelievably rude and unprofessional. “I don’t know. I don’t work through the week. You’ll just have to come in.” I explained I already had and we’d discussed designs. His response again was “I don’t know.” After which, he hung up the phone on me. Not even a goodbye. Completely unprofessional. I will gladly take my money elsewhere because I wouldn’t want her first experience to be done at a place of disrespect and obvious unprofessionalism. What a joke.<//text>< Pictures>

Hey I recently came to this place for a tattoo and was not disappointed! I got a quick question and can anyone please answer? When you get your ears pierced do they come with the jewelry or do you have to bring your own?<//Review>

I had an appointment with one of the artists out of this shop and unfortunately I had to reschedule. I contact the artist and informed him of this situation, the artist told me that he would get back to me on when his next available day was. I have not been able to get ahold of him since. This was 2 months ago after I gave him a $200 deposit. I will not be going to this place again and everyone that I come across that is looking to get work done I will warn them of this place.< /text>

Look this is based on one person not the entire shop. I booked an appointment with IVAN and was reschedule about 3 times ended up getting the tattoo during a walk-in. Hes good!! Light hands and great at tattooing. I have a few MALE friends that have had the same issue with him. Apparently he only likes Female clients.</text>

<Review>I love this place. This has always been the place that came to mind when I thought about getting tattoos and piercings. I asked the piercing guy and opinion on something and  Piercing guy actually cares and gives his opinion on whether it will work or not. I will always be coming here for my future piercings. Gotten all my piercings done here and piercer is nice and knows what he is doing. Very sanitary!! Very professional and went here to get my first tattoo done by caesar and no regrets! Caesar gave me exactly what I wanted. I told him exactly what I wanted and he gave me exactly that and better. I will definitely continue going here to get my future piercings and future tattoos done. I would reccomend this place to anyone that's wanting to get piercings and tattoos<//Review>< pics>

I walked in to get info about getting a tattoo and the guy behind the counter was too involved with tv and his phone to even greet me! Couldnt even put the phone down while talking to me! Guess they don't need business here! Will go elsewhere!</Text>

<text>Juan is professional, detailed, and extremely easy to work with. if you're looking for detail and realism, Juan is the artist for you. Bar none, he's killed it every time he's worked on me, love all of his work.
Eric JUST did some work on my chest(script), and I couldn't be happier. He's good people and fit me in at the last minute.
I haven't had one bad experience with this crew. Highly respected for all of their award winning works.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><username>Sabor Kustoms</username></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Always great burgers. I think they changed their bread supplier because the buns, although fresh, were a little 'chewy'. Not as easy to bite through. Probably sounds petty, but caused the burger/cheese/onions/lettuce to slide out on each bite. I will still go back, love their food, staff is always excellent!!<//Text><Time>1622337450310<//Time><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

Ordered the mushroom burger. Burger was very good. I'm upset with the price. Menu states the combo is $10.99 yet I was charged $12.47 plus tax. When I questioned the price the young lady politely told me that was after tax. If that is after tax why was my total $13.44? Tax on $10.99 is 85 cents, I should have only paid $11.84. I was charged $1.60 more, paying $13.44. Very disappointed and most likely won't be back and definitely won't be recommending J's Burgers.< /Text>

Massive burger!  Picked up burgers for the fam tonight.  I have to say it's damn good!  Burgers are huge.  Almost too big and I'm a big eater.  I have the western burger.  Large beef patty and very juicy.  Fresh made onion ring and thick cut bacon really sets this burger off.  Even the fries are hand cut.  I will definitely come again.</review>

Arguably.. the best burger in town. The double cheese burger was outstanding.. the fries were hot, crispy and seasoned.. a must try when in the mood for a burger. They will also wrap it in lettuce, to keep it low carb..< /Review>

They have the tastiest freshest burger and fries I have had for a longetime. They make everything fresh and from scratch. No Frozen patties used and you can definitely tell in in the taste of the Ortega burger Combo Special- that's what I had.  It came with a fresh basket of fries like IN-n-Out style but  with a more generous portion and a drink for a bargain price of $9.95 plus tax. The burger size was certainly on the big size. I'm coming back for sure.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORQo2jK4I0jLi9tegF-Hob5QGP9qjxPWPYTm_Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO60sUM5imyHzv0jTwJ2HGzkBiFQNstD8dYV09l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEJ7Ah4HL8o3HZqVlpi6I1xbfm5vfhq63h14lK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8UsWUpZqbXF-7WJXQeCoNbabQnd0kKFUaLNgI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDOEVc-2iTLbyJmuL5Ur4x_REQBw4TbuwFNiGD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVdYMF0HvcTuwRWpKileOtzKpZjmbVdKkfMn4U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtjNDJnCm9dQUxChRke5NtwOATXfz2PfvkQWBH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0w7BPQP1VG8i6MZ4N-_oubr06iFIYhoWIw3xP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONhvMvi8er1PWMkNSD0ztLP6pComd78ScaUtM2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSmY5M6OyOU2jIGmyb6JBXDSlRFza8divHvfDx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxNlIIZKRJAeYhfth9B2boDUPl4Vnn66LqSvwT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWPnLfYuXa01iTV1DfIRfit6KFKkzXgMoTVqVd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhJHrclyT7ZaOuJgqvgaKHuhF8ja37uyGu_POO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80ecc54231df1e51:0x238fb96b2642bfaf</GmapID></record>

Yeah, this place rocks. Obviously you aren't here for the atmosphere, you're here for the burger, and this one is superior. Excellent toasted bun, fresh toppings, good, flavorful beef. The fries were crispy and the portions substantial. Seems like the garlic on them was slightly sauteed, instead of the usual raw garlic bite.
Wish I could have tried the milkshakes, but I was stuffed with the burger and fries. Glad I didn't get an extra pattie, despite the quality.

The restaurant is kind of hard to spot in the dark, unless you know what you are looking for.</review>

<time>1597290811660</time><text>Good burgers as usual, but minus one star for service with an apparent two-faced, bi-polar attitude. We waited about 5 minutes before anybody noticed us. Cashier finally came out of the kitchen after chatting with the cook, and was  very pleasant when we first came in, but after we paid for our order, she went back into the kitchen and was talking and laughing with the cook again. Not a word about where to wait, just that she would let us know when it was ready. When she came back in a few minutes, and saw we were still standing there, and rather abrasively barked at us to "Hey! wait outside, we can't just have people waiting around in here. Covid, you know." After  stepping outside, we saw a customer who had  been sitting outside at a patio table come in to request a drink refill and the cashier not only served him immediately, but chatted with him for 2-3 minutes after. A warning to all: if you order takeout here, be prepared to step outside IMMEDIATELY after ordering or you will get chewed out. The cashier was  pleasant again when she brought our order, spouting compliments,  but that was little recompense for her attitude earlier. I agree with supporting local small business, but I do NOT agree with poor treatment of customers, and attempting to patronize  them afterward as if nothing happened.< /text><pics>None</pics><userid>107488893490263091012</userid>< Response>

Great local burgers and shakes! Very tasty! A little more burger joint style decor interior would give a 5 star rating from me! Great burgers nonetheless!...

Visited the Paso Robles location Sunday June 09, 2019... Nothing like the Atascadero Location at all. Hard to believe it's under the same name.
Very dirty, floors n tables were very sticky. It seemed all but the Coke was out. Fries were very soggy and greasy. Burgers were dry and over cooked. Veggies however, were fresh. Buns were dry and almost stale.<//Text>< pics>

<date>1554519159207< /date><rating>3< /rating><Review>For about $8 you can get a single cheeseburger, fries, and a drink. A drive thru quarter pounder meal costs more than that. Despite constant mixups with orders delivered to the wrong table, the food arrived quickly. I would have to guess J's Burgers is trying to emulate the Double-Double folks with the style and ingredients on the burgers. Includes shredded lettuce, tomato, and onion. The difference is J's uses their own sauce, which is tasty, but a bit watery. (makes a mess by the time you get to the end of the burger). The fries are shoe string thin, way too greasy, and don't taste very good, just like the other guys. Limited soda fountain drinks.
They also offer kids meals, chicken sandwiches, onion rings, and milkshakes.
Convenient location on Spring Street with a tiny parking lot shared with the shoe store everyone loves to hate.
Open late-ish compared to other locally owned places.< /Review>< Pics>

How could you beat this place? The food is fantastic and the prices are absolutely ridiculously cheap. The potatoes are fresh cut in front of you and the burgers are hand pressed. The food is always delicious and the wait time is minimal. I seriously don't think there is a better deal to be had as far as Burger chains go.< /review>

Lettuce, tomato and onions were fresh and crisp, not sure what kind of bun but an upgrade from most and very fresh as well. Patties had a nice charbroiled flavor and the overall size was very generous. And this was only about $5.25. As good a burger and value as you'll find ... I will definitely go back<//Text>< Pictures>

GREAT burger and fries, I am not kidding! Just a little joint,  order at the counter kind of place but WOW! You can see the kitchen from the counter and that's when you know it's going to be good...the burger patties are fresh, not frozen, and hand formed , you don't see that much anymore.  The fries, what can I say, except awesome ...thin hand cut and cooked to perfection and if you like garlic, I highly recommend the garlic fries but be aware that they are very garlicky,  I love that the garlic has a hint of vinegar with gives a nice tang. Go, you won't be disappointed!< /Text>

Good food with decent prices. I travel alot and always look for the mom and pop shops to eat at and usually the prices are a little steep for what you get and food is mediocre. However J's burgers is very good and you definitely get your money's worth. I stop in here often since I'll be in this city for 3 months.</text>

I can't recommend this place enough. It's a hidden gem in Paso Robles. There burgers are high quality, and the fries are fresh cut.

I still prefer Sylvester's, but they are more expensive. J's sits in the gap between them and In n Out.

These guys have the best burgers in Paso. Skip Bronco burger and Good Ol' Burger and come here instead.</Review>

We stopped at J’s on our way to Santa Barbara. Burgers were delicious and the secret sauce added just the right flavor. Fresh cut French fries were delicious. Great burgers and we also enjoyed the shakes.< /text>

No frills eatery for the burger lover. Fresh beef, fresh hand-cut fries and no disappointment. Traditional burger place that also does a chicken sandwich and salads. Made fresh to order, with a nice patio under a heritage oak tree. Prices are VERY reasonable and service is quick. No gimmicks, just honest food executed perfectly.</text>

I was shocked by the low price, this being the best burger in A-town. Great garlic fries subbed into my meal at no extra cost! Monstrous double cheeseburger! Clean tables, restroom, and drink/condiment area. My only complaint is that they allowed someone to solicit me while I sat, waiting for my food. Policy change needed!< /Review>

One of the better burger joints in the area.  Price point is good, product and service was good.  The sitting area was average at best, needs some attention.</Text>

<text>Good prices on good burgers. There is a lot of bread on the Buns to make the burger look a little bigger than it is but nevertheless it's still a pretty good burger for the price. Good and friendly staff place is clean and pretty noticeable from the road going down El Camino.</text>< Resp>

Found this gem of a place by mistake and so glad we did! Great service, great burgers, and awesome onion rings. They even discovered they had forgotten the bacon on my burger and corrected the mistake before I discovered it! No pictures because the food was devoured too quickly.< /Text>

They place gets busy but serving time is only about 10-15 minutes. The place could use Satellite TV, hmm where can they get DISH?

DONT get the garlic fries. Burger is good, sort of like In and Out, great value. But the garlic fries are this disgusting inedible soggy bag filled with raw garlic. It was so gross. How could they take something that sounds so good and produce something so horrible?! I'm still not over it.</text>

<text>Cheeseburger is good, fries are average, onion rings are good but crunchy and doughy, if that makes sense. The night I was there the staff was struggling to get orders right, forgetting my fries resulting in me making a return trip because I had ordered to go. Another customer in front of me could not get the cashier to understand her order, causing a lot of confusion between 3 different employees.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80ecc54231df1e51:0x238fb96b2642bfaf<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Had my first J's burger tonight. Cheeseburger with bacon and avocado. Best homemade taste ever and the bacon was wonderfully thick and flavorful. Fries were very good also but maybe a tad over seasoned. All in all very good for the price. We will return!!<//review>

<review>Small hole-in-the-wall burger joint next to Takkens. Small menu, mostly burgers & fries. I've visited twice and ordered a double cheeseburger each time, and they were both absolutely delicious. The service was good and they cooked the food fast. As of April 2016, the double cheeseburgers are only $4.85, about the same price as fast food but infinitely tastier. If you're looking for a real, hand pressed burger but don't want to spend a lot, this is the place. Will keep coming, and would recommend to anyone.<//review>< rate>

The prices are really good. I wasn't too impressed by the burger I ordered, but the rest of the food was pretty good. The environment in doors isn't too special either. Good place on a budget though.< /Text>

Tables were very dirty. Asked them to clean table and it went from very dirty to just dirty. Place is in pretty bad shape. Food was good,but couldn't get passed all the black bugs on the ceiling lights,walls dirty,tables dirty and kids high chairs black from where toddlers usually touch. I needed to use resteoom, but after seeing how they had there place so diety I figured restrooms were worst and my hands were cleaner not being washed than walking in there to wash them. Staff is very unwelcoming and seemed bothered when I asked them to clean a table for me. Wish the Santa Maria one was still here, that place was always clean and food was always freah.<//Review><Name>Luis Orozco< /Name>< Rating>

We got hungry travelling home after visiting Pismo Beach. This was a little gem to find. Delicious & well priced. The staff was very friendly. The building was very clean inside and out. Very impressed. :)<//Text>

<text>Big fan of J's here. I love the simplicity of the menu with the ability to customize your order , the quality of the burgers, and the small business atmosphere of the little burger joint. I recommend J's to all my family and friends.<//text>< name>

< review>
I couldn't ask for a better cheeseburger, it really is very close to perfect. The fries are a single fry style similar to Inn and Out fries, good but not my favorite as they are overly oily. I didn't like the onion rings very much, they tasted a little under done. In my opinion they need to work on the decor inside, its very basic and creates an unpleasant mood if you're eating in. Overall its a great small town burger joint and I'll certainly return although I will phone my order in for pick up.</review>

This place is great! We genuinely enjoyed our meals both my kids and my wife. The only thing I feel will make it great is what the other reviewer said, some TV maybe a little more decorations other than that it is great.<//Review>

Review is purely for french fries, which are quite good and a really good quantity to price ratio. Overall one of the best french fries in Atascadero though you'll usually have to wait a bit for them compared to a place like in-and-out.< /review>

Great burgers. Nice staff. This isn't a fast food burger, it alwayse seems to have that nice, fresh, "home-made" flavor. I dont go to many burger places because they are usually bland and disappointing. But ill never turn down a J's burger.  P.S.  theyr burgers with bacon added takes their great burgers to a whole new level. The bacon is alwayse cooked like bacon so you get that perfect soft crunch rather than the chewy strips most places use.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Don't place an order by phone you will still have to wait in line. Terrible customer service at the register {a rude "cow girl"} I waited 20 minutes in line to get my food that had already been sitting on a cold counter top from before I had even arrived..by the time i got my food it was stale cold when I asked about my food being cold I was told "no you're good" I thought the purpose of placing an order by phone was so you don't have to wait in line, you could get your food wile its still hot and then get out of the way. The food is cheap but isn't good enough to go back after this little experience.<//Text>< pictures>

Good cheaper burgers, as long as you don't add any toppings. Then it gets pricy.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The burger is very good, but the fries do not. But it is a good place, quiet, economical and fast.
