<text>The food is really good, but the service is horrible (really slow and a little bit of an attitude). It's better for loud and drunken karaoke, if that's what you prefer in a restaurant.< /text>< Date>

It brings in a lot of supporters and unfortunately, from time to time the restaurant does get noisy toward the end of the week.

<text>Too much expensive than quality. I would go other restaurants or just skip eating. Taste is not bad but think again, this place isn't worth to pay that much.

And tooooooo much LOUD. I CANT HEAR MY FRIENDS YELLING!!!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Came here for happy hour, the food was mediocre. The garlic noodles were mushy not your traditional garlic noodles, taste more like Filipino spaghetti. Drinks are pretty good, the $1 drink specials you have to purchase an $8 dollar drink first. Probably won't return.< /Review>

But I assure you that all our noodles are cooked in a wok. We don't use a microwave to cook our food. We cook our noodle twice since they are raw. Once to blanch and then toss in a wok. We only pick up 20 pounds of fresh noodle a day so I will definitely check with our supplier. As for the beer, I will go back on my camera to make sure that our bartenders are pouring the beers in our pint size glass. It is the only beer size glass we use. With everything, we will do our best to correct any mistakes to assure the next guests will not be disappointed. Thank you again for letting me know."}<//resp>

<Review>The noodles tasted microwaved. It all tasted like something I would buy frozen in a bag, or buy for $4.95 at a hole in the wall place. The beer was small. And even though the restaurant was half full, it was incredibly loud. I wouldn't come here again. The location and decor are pretty nice. I think that's where all their money went.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>Unicorn is a surprise find in Financial District in an area you wouldn't expect a lively restaurant and bar to be. The decor is that of a night lounge and the music can be a bit loud. However, it is great for groups. Happy Hour lasts from 4-8PM and features $6 wines, $4 beers and 2-for-1 7 cocktails (basically 2 cocktails for $7). For food, try the charbroiled steak, roti, prawn spring rolls and chicken wings.< /Text>< pics>

Happy Hour Review only. Good cocktails that are first one $8 get the second same cocktail for another $1. Good HH menu as well - fish tacos, shrimp rolls, short rib were all delicious. I'm definitely going to be coming here regularly for HH.<//Text>

<Text>Garlic noodles and the sauteed veggies made for a great lunch+ (left overs! Yay!) @ $7 each, seemed like a great deal!! Dining partners had the clay pot, and were both disappointed in the lack of flavor, blandness of the dish. Truffle fries were interesting and met with great appeal.
Incredibly busy for lunch today, (don't know if this is an everyday/ typical situation, but they didn't seem prepared, and service was slow and disappointing for many parties dining today. I'll end on a mostly positive note, my Vietnamese coffee order, was forgot till the end of our meal, but was delicious, like a coffee milkshake. (They have a HH, and karaoke in the evening, perhaps trying to do too much?)<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>This place is a hidden gem.  It certainly isn't fine dining, but its an interestingly decorated restaurant that does a great job with Asian Fusion.  I have been here a number of times and would recommend the mango chicken as well as the birds nest sautee.<//review><gmap_id>0x808580622f6e7889:0xe31b055dc763d09</gmap_id><Rating>3<//Rating></record>

<user_name>Nhung Kim Phan< /user_name><date>1409005711074< /date><Rate>4</Rate><text>More of a 3.5 (especially for the 2 for 1 happy hour drink - buy 2 of the same drink, 2nd one is $1) -

Came here on a Thursday with a bunch of friends, and they let you sit at the tables in the middle and still get happy hour pricing. Yay!  I dislike it when bars only allow you happy hour pricing in specific area, especially if they don't have room for you ~  Here, though, the whole restaurant is happy hour!  The drinks were a bit water down - I got a Moscow Mule, and they must have ran out of the gold/iron cups - I got it in a glass.  The french 75 was a little bitter.  Weird.  The champagne drinks were good - good deal - and good flavor.

Food: We got the spring rolls which came w/ a peanut sauce. Good - but nothing special.   The garlic noddle (who knew garlic noodle had a red sauce version!) - Staff was good, and accommodating for our group.<//text>< pics>

I tried Unicorn during a business lunch. They did a good job of getting us in. The atmosphere is interesting and inviting. The staff did a good job of taking our order while reading the table and not being too intrusive. The food was mediocre and overpriced. There wasn't much flavor and the dishes seemed uninspired.< /text>

<Text>Place - many tables inside. Good for group. Also bar in it. Nice interior.

Taste - overall not too bad. Starter fried shrimp was my favorite. It came with wasabi sauce,sweet waluts and rice something. Oxtail stew had strong taste to me. If you don't like strong asian sauce, I don't recommend it. Stew came with egg noddle. Chicken breast was also good. It was soft and sauce was well matched with chicken.

Service and Price - Service was good. Price was too expensive for thoes plates. I paid with Groupon deal $25 for $50. I bought this $25, paid tax and tip $17. Tatol $42. I felt it was still expensive than what I ate. It doesn't worth to pay original price $67.</Text>< pics>

We went there for a happy hour function with a group and a few of us stayed for dinner afterwards.

After dinner, the bill came and we luckily took and look and found out we were double charged for three items. It's almost impossible to double charge for food at a restaurant these days, because since all orders are entered by computer, whatever is entered is made, so the mistake is found out.

The waiter was not the least bit surprised when we showed him that we were double charged, so we checked the happy hour bill and saw we were double charged there too.

Never eating here again. Oh, by the way, the food was ok asain fusion but a little the food court oily side.<//review>

I had $200.00 in Unicorn gift certificates which they would not honor as the small print at the bottom indicated they had expired. Not a good experience.</text>

Dr. Aziz couldn't be more wonderful, and every member of the staff is consistently helpful and so incredibly friendly. Our dog has some reactivity issues, and the Magnolia staff always goes above and beyond to ensure that we (and their other clients) have a safe, smooth, positive visit. We feel so lucky to have Magnolia taking care of our babies!<//Text>

I have been going here for several years now. I wouldn't go anywhere else! The veterinarians are very kind and caring individuals. They want to do everything to help you and your pet have a happy and healthy life! I cannot say enough about the girls up front! Staff is very professional friendly and generally cares! This may sound odd but they've kind of become like family to me! I trust them completely!< /text>

Barkley, a feral cat I adopted last March has been well cared for at Magnolia Animal Hospital as have all my dogs and cats over the past 30 years or so. Everyone is always friendly, accommodating and have taken excellent care of my furry friends.

I now have another feral cat now named" Meme", formerly "Meow" that has been to see Dr. Shockray and has a clean bill of health, except for some missing teeth.< /Text>

<Text>My mom used Magnolia Animal Hospital for years and I've been taking my dog here since he became mine. They have never once tried upselling me on unnecessary x-rays or procedures. My dog wines when he has to leave because of the nice and friendly staff and doctors. Go here to get solid advice for a fair price.</Text>< response>

They don’t care about your pet as much as they care about getting the money out of your wallet. Pricewise they are higher than other vets that I went to and they want you to make unnecessary  appointments so they can charge you for it.  I wanted to pay for a renewal of my dogs flea medication and they said I needed to pay for another preventative check up first!  Every six months I have to take her in and pay for a checkup when there’s nothing wrong with her just to get flea medication that I’m already paying $30 a pill for??  And to top it off the lady on the phone was rude about it.  I definitely wouldn’t recommend.< /Text><Date>1617658765618< /Date>< pictures>

We love this place and so does my little dog, Scrappy.
He recently  had surgery on his knee and is doing great. The whole staff is awesome. They are doing the best they can during this covid crisis. They are still very polite  perky and friendly.

I would advise anyone who loves their little fur babies
To give them a try. We love Dr. Aziz.</review>

<Review>I was expecting high prices and "used car salesman" pressure like some of the other animal doctor offices I've been to. But our experiences at Magnolia Animal Hospital have been nothing short of fantastic. My little chihuahua, Penny, loves it too. The people there are genuine animal lovers and always take the best care of her. And the prices are actually affordable! I will never go anywhere else now.

<rate>5<//rate><text>If I can give 10 stars I would for this EXCELLENT Animal Hospital. My baby Mona was not eating nor drinking and losing weight. I was looking for a good and most importantly honest vet for her, and I did. The nurse Amy was very gentle, nice, and understanding. When I called yesterday morning she advised me to come asap at 10:15 am. I was thrilled!!! I mean I did not have to make an appointment and wait days for my girl. When I arrived everything was ready for my Mona. After examination, Doctor Shokry called me and gave me a plan, blood work and digestive meds, and it WORKED!!! the same day. My girl drinked for the first time after 2 weeks and ate. She feels better and alive finally.

I FOUND my vet hospital, and will stick to it. Never will change. Their price is affordable. You can feel that this hospital will not take advantage of you. Thank you Amy and Doctor Shokri.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I came in with and emergency with my dog. She needed stitches bad. The doctors were worried about closing up and getting home early. They don't close for an hour and a half but they couldn't see my dog. they had enough time to trim another dog's nails though. Find yourself another vet this place is not an animal hospital. They should remove hospital from the name. Hope they have a great Friday evening. I'm spending mine driving another 20 minutes to the next open REAL animal hospital.</review>

I came here to help my neighbor cat because he was injured. The nurses and people at the front desk were very sweet and caring. I would’ve expected a nice and caring doctor as well, but it turned out I had a rude veterinarian. He handled my cat aggressively even though my cat was shaking and was absolutely harmless. I did not feel safe with him, but he get nicer and more aware when I started tearing up. I found one of the nurses absolutely sweet but I forgot to get her name. I really think the prices are fair.</Text>

<Review>I would like to thank the office staff for their kindness and welcome environment. Thank you for your great attitude and for giving a warm  environment. I also want to thank Dr. Aziz for showing his love for animals. To show what I mean, we brought home an 8 week old puppy. He was so cute and he looked perfect but little did we know that something was happening inside him.  As the time passed by his face started swelling, he was loosing his facial hair, and his ears looked   bad with discharge, we didn't know what to do. We looked for a vet who could see us on a Friday afternoon but no one was willing only the emergency hospitals which charge very high fees but after a lot of research, we were blessed to find Magnolia Animal Hospital. Dr. Aziz was willing to see us at 7:30 pm on a Friday, I was so happy. Dr. Aziz saw the problem right away, my puppy was having an autoimmune  disease, and knew right away how to fight the disease.  I  was so blessed with his help in healing my puppy and not bankrupting me. I only spent a few hundred dollars. I did my research and I saw many doctors charging thousands of dollars, even up to $5,000 dollars because to fight this disease it requires several weeks of steroids treatment and restoring the body. Thank you Dr. Aziz!< /Review><Time>1582997467395</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Karla Rojo< /username>< userid>

I love Dr. Aziz.  He has treated my dogs for over 10 years.  He gives 110% to his patients.  He made sure I could give a diabetic dog shots (so it didn’t hurt her).  He spends the time with pet parents.  He never once pushed me to euthanize, he always gave me options.  I highly recommend Magnolia Animal hospital.</review>

I am almost afraid to post this review.  The secret will be out!  Dr. Aziz and staff have taken great care of our critters for nearly two decades.  The compassion and love they give have made them family!

I have been taking my dog here for the last 2.5 years. The office staff have always been very friendly and helpful. The doctors are very knowledgeable. I have made quite a few trips to the vet and I always am confident that my dog is in good hands.< /text>

I don't know what I would have done without this team. Everyone genuinely cares and they took care of my fur baby like she was their own after she had to have knee surgery. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Dr Shokry stays true to his Vet oath to care for the pets well-being no matter what. I told him my dog was bit by a tick & at the time I didn't have enough money for everything, and he gave me the best cure for her anyways. Pills that treat majority o tick bites.<//text>

Dr. Aziz and his staff are truly amazing. Whenever I take my pets in, the staff take their time and care and I want to add they always find a quick appointment time slot for us. Dr. Aziz is thorough and very caring, I couldn't be happier and will continue going forever!!< /Text>

I have taken our pets to the Hospital for over 25 years and have always felt secure in the treatment they are getting.  Both Dr. Aziz and Dr. Shokry are knowledgeable and professional in dealing both with me and my pets.    The office staff is always congenial and on top of what is going on at all times. I would recommend Magnolia Animal Hospital to anyone without a bit of reservation.</Text>

<text>Dr. Aziz is the most compassionate and knowledgeable vet I have ever taken my dogs to. I have been going to Magnolia Animal Hospital for well over 24 years and would not take my dogs to any other veterinarian. They are the best including the front staff which are very efficient and fast. The assistants in the back that handle the animals are gentle and kind. I really can't say enough good things about this animal hospital.

Thank you so much for all you do!!

<review>In 1995 I visited this Animal Hospital and was a client for many years. At some point I found the staff to be less than friendly, and the Dr. was always running late. I left for awhile. Recently I returned to Magnolia Animal Hospital. I was quite surprised with the new staff, and the clinic upgrades. The office always smells fresh and it looks clean and well maintained. I continue to be a client here. The service is friendly, it meets my needs. And the Dr. is quite prompt in attending to my pets.</review></record></dataset><record>

I moved back to this area to have Dr. Azziz and the clinic again for my pets.  He and his staff always have had a wonderful bedside manner with my pets.  I hope they are around for a long time.

Magnolia Animal Clinic has been my vet choice since 1990 and hope I continue with them.  My pets are always treated so well and not stressed out at all.  The bedside manner is what is important for pets to feel at ease.

Dr. Azziz is a kind and patient doctor with my pets. It is clear that he enjoys his job very much.  I hope I never leave this area for I would be hard pressed to find a nicer/better vet.  And, my kitties have always been at ease with him.< /Review>

<text>This is the ONLY place I bring our Weimaraner.  The doctors are excellent & the front desk girls are awesome!!!  Lucky doesn't even get scared when we go there.  They bring her back for a check up & she goes willingly!!!

She gets all her shots, check ups, flea meds, grooming - everything at Magnolia Animal Hospital.  She was spayed there, and they treated her when she was bitten by another dog at the beach.

We've been to other vets before & this one is the best!!!  The entire clinic is very clean and smells fresh.  I highly recommend to all animal lovers!!!!<//text><name>Patty Sharpe</name>< rating>

I took in and adopted a stray toy poodle that was in bad shape. Dr. Aziz went the extra mile to get her healthy again. The little girl is now running around happy as can be. I appreciate the extra effort Dr. Aziz provided. Marshmallow thanks him too!</review>

There are a lot of vet clinics around. This clinics customer service is average at best. When I picked my dog up from boarding I found a luke warm raw bone. Originally the staff was supposed to give it to my dog to entertain him while being boarded, when I brought the two bones they were frozen. At minimum they should return things the way it was given to them.
Medically I think they do an okay job. Dr.Aziz does seem fair and doesn't seem to charge for things you may not need.<//Review>

I have been taking my dogs to Magnolia Animal Hospital for years.   The doctors are very knowledgeable and the staff is always friendly.  Dr. Aziz is amazing, he is so gentle and really cares.  I would not take my dogs anywhere else!  When it was time to put our 18 year poodle to sleep a few years back Dr. Aziz and the assistants in the office helped us during this very difficult time.   Just last year we adopted a dog from the LA shelter and I immediately brought her in for a check-up.  She was so scared, so very sick and they took such good care of her!  When we arrived  she had a bad cough, she was so skinny and her hair was falling out. Within a month she had gained weight, her cough was gone and her coat thick and glossy.  With such good care she was able to relax and and her true personality came out. My little Gracie is a lively little girl, so perky and bubbly.  The staff at Magnolia Animal hospital also takes care of my other two dogs, Sebastian and Chiquita.  They make sure their shots are always up to date, and also provide preventative medication for fleas.   In addition, they offer grooming services and I am always pleased with the results.  I would highly recommend taking your pets to Magnolia Animal Hospital.  They are the best!!!<//Text>

I only went here a few times, but my experience was....meh.

Pros- close to my house, great hours, and great at diagnosing a problem and fixing it

Cons- the vet was rude, and my dog HATED going there- and my dog loves going to the vet

We went there for an ear infection, then a paw infection (my pup is a little high maintenance) and both times my dog was scared of the staff, who seemed indifferent to him (not really kind, or trying to make him comfortable, just kind of dragging him along) and the vet had a condescending tone when things didn't go perfectly (the bandage on the paw came off and he told me "well, we discussed limiting his running. oh well). Seriously? I can't stop my dog from running for three days! He's a puppy! I was going to try bringing treats next time so maybe he would warm up to the staff, but I am not going to be spoken down to.

Alas, I guess my search for a vet in Huntington Beach area continues....</Review>

Ok we had a different vet. Our vets service had been lacking. The waits were ridiculous. One day after being told they might be able to help us within the next 4 hours I called Magnolia. I needed a travel certificate for Baja California.
(The travel certificate literally takes a 5 min. doctor check up. Just a look and see to make sure the pet is not actively ill. Then it has to be filled out another 5 minutes.)
Magnolia had an appointment in about an hour. When we arrived we realized we didn't have our dogs vaccination records. They said they'll have them faxed over, and it wouldn't be a problem. I think the whole visit took about 30 min. and only because we had to wait a few for the fax.
I will never go to another animal hospital in OC. They were kind, and took care of everything when our own vet didn't.
Thank you Magnolia!!!!</review>

<review>Always easy to make a reservation or to change a reservation. Staff is always very friendly. Doctor is great and knowledgeable, and great with pets. There's a little jar of treats in the lobby for your kitties or puppies when you stop by.

Had to come here for little Ninja, he hurt his toe. We made an appointment, I called and they had an available spot for Saturday. I was running late that day and called an hour before the appointment, and they said no problem. Very flexible to our schedule. We got in and they weighted ninja, 31.6lbs!! Then the nurse did a quick temperature test, said he was normal. And got to see the doctor within 10 minutes of our appointment. Even though it was a crazy day, Dr. Aziz still came by to treat Ninja, see what was wrong. Very helpful. Ninja had an injured toe, so he prescribed pain medication and antibiotics, and said we needed to come back for him to remove the broken toe since he didn't have time to do it that day. He also prescribed a cone and bandaged up the foot. Since he was also hitting his 1 year mark to get his 2nd round of rabies shots done, they did it that day too. And since it happened to be a Saturday, it was 20% off! Woo! I started getting a reminder in the mail a week or two ago, so I'm glad they remind you because I feel like most people would forget.

So with his medication, cone, bandage, and check up with the doctor, it came out to be right under $200. Luckily, his shots were discounted, and I received a "Free Exam" coupon in the mail awhile ago, and luckily I remembered to bring it in. It saved me $35 on the check up, so his shots were only about $12!!

We came back to get his toenail removed, and Dr. Aziz had to take another look at his toe. He told us that his toe was injured, but it actually was not as bad as he thought it was. He said Ninja can heal on his own, it was more of a sprain. And that if it itches, we can give him the cortizone cream that we use. He says they sell it there, but it's actually cheaper at CVS or something, so he recommended us going there, which I was surprised that he said that, but awesome doctor. We asked him a few more questions which he answered, and then we were off! They didn't charge for the second exam, and we were very happy! Will be coming back for Ninja's regular check ups.<//review>< Pictures>

I have been taking my animals to Dr. Aziz at Magnolia animal Hospital for a long time.  The front staff has change of course, but not the commitment and caring of Dr. Aziz.  We have been through several pets together and I would not consider going any place other than Magnolia Animal Hospital.  The remodel makes this hosiptal a very comfortable place for my dogs and they do not mind coming for their check-ups and other care as required including grooming.

The staff makes sure to remember the pets and owners!  This is huge.  That demonstrates their commitment to my pets as well.  Keep up the good work!<//Text>

We have taken our 5 pets from 1998 to the present to Dr. Aziz, Dr. Shokry, and Dr. Toro, who have extended the lives of our dog  and cats  through thorough and specialized care. Their explanations of preferred and alternative treatments allows one to weigh all the factors in treating the pets.The staff is consistently kind, caring, and careful to explain all charges.
When it's time to say goodbye, I'd rather be in their facility with familiar, kind faces joining ours to lovingly say farewell.  Thank you Drs. for many years of professional and personal care!  RIP Casper (21), Zorro (14), Isabel (13).<//Text>

What can I say about Magnolia Animal Hospital.  Gosh, we've been clients for about 20 years now.  Dr. Aziz is the best.  He has helped us through many, many difficult times and has shown true compassion and always provided his personal opinion when we have been undecided in some of the more difficult decisions we have been faced with.   I have received many many calls from him so this shows his true compassion for our pets.  You will never find another like him.  He has late hours which is convenient for most working people.  We truly value his judgement in his care of our furry kids.  Thank you Dr. Aziz for all that you do...<3<//Text>

My husband and I have had cats for 20+ years and had a number of vets prior to finding Magnolia Animal Hospital more than ten years ago.  We are very happy with the professional knowledge, courtesy and compassionate approach of Dr. Aziz and Dr. Shokry. We seem to be adopted only by cats that have a wide variety of complex chronic medical problems and are in need of fairly intensive continuing care, so we have had a lot of experience with Drs. Azia and Shokry, all of which has been excellent.  We have always felt that we got the most knowledgeable and most compassionate medical care for our cats, and treatment options were always explained to us clearly so we could make the best decisions regarding their care.  The front office staff is efficient, pleasant and very well trained.  The fact that they love animals is very obvious!  I could not make any higher recommendation for Drs. Aziz and Shokry; they are quite extraordinary.  One of our cats was blind and very skittish because he could not see.  When he had to stay overnight after surgeries, there would always be a sign on his crate door telling the staff that he was blind so they could be aware of that when they provided care for him.  That always touched us . . .<//Review>

He has even gone as far as to provide free boarding and medications when we wanted to make sure our kitty wasn't alone for a week after surgery, since I couldn't take time off work. Not many veterinarians would do that for someone.  Our animals and I all love the staff and Dr. Aziz at Magnolia Animal Hospital and give them the highest score possible.< /review>< pics>

Decided to try this place despite all the horror stories, and I’m glad I did. I usually use another parking service when I leave my car in LA, but this place had the absolute best price for leaving my car long term (17 days). They were less than half the price of everyone else in town.

Check in was a breeze, showed my confirm # and paid, got a ride to LAX in about 10 min. Called for pickup and had a van there in about 10 min also.

Nothing stolen, no damage, maybe I just got lucky, but I have to review based on my experience with them.< /text>

Without so much as a courtesy of notifying me of the incident when it occurred, I arrived to pick up my car and several other cars completely damaged. The front, rear and front passenger windows were shattered. When I called the Hawthorne police department to report the incident the attendant on duty refused  to give the officers access to the camera footage that showed the alleged break-in that caused the damages. They are refusing to take responsibility for the damages and I am continuously told the manager/owner is unavailable. I am making it as my personal mission to have their permit to enter LAX revoked.</review>

The process for Mega Airport parking wasn’t bad. However, not every car has a parking spot, they cram the cars wherever they can so if you’re afraid of your car getting scratched, I wouldn’t recommend here. The shuttle was the worst part. We waited over 20 minutes for it to pick us up from the airport. The worker inside finally called the shuttle driver and it sounded like he was just hanging out somewhere because he didn’t see any people waiting outside. He then didn’t help load anything into the shuttle and made us wait another 10 minutes while he took a personal phone call. Waiting for the shuttle after arriving back took over 20 minutes again, the other person in the shuttle said he waited over 30. We then waited extra time for someone who wasn’t ready to be picked up but begged the driver to wait for him. When we finally got back they already had our vehicles pulled out and waiting for us, which was nice and easy, but I did not like that my key was left in the car with the window down. If the shuttle was faster, it would have been a better experience. You pay for what you get, I guess, and this is cheap.</Review>

<Text>We left our car here for a week and they sideswiped it with another car. My car is only 2 months old and was in pristine condition. They told us to call the manager the next morning and to send an email. The manager, Tarry, has ignored our calls and emails for the last 10 days. It's not worth saving a little money to have them damage your car. Don't park here!<//Text>< pics>

<review>I think the low reviews are worth noting, and here's mine.

Yes, they are very reasonably priced for car storage and, yes, our car was returned to us without damage.  But the hassle in getting them to pick us up promptly (including my tired wife, daughter, and toddler granddaughter after hours on a plane) was so frustrating!  We told the office exactly where we were standing by baggage claim, and were told they would dispatch a "white van with red writing").  35 minutes passed, no van, no phone call or text message from Mega.  We then called them and were told, "no, you are supposed to be waiting on the top floor for airport departure, not down at the arrival level!"  That's the first we heard about it.  BTW, it was so difficult communicating clearly with the desk guy because of his thick accent and impatience with us.  Of course, now he says he'll need to now dispatch another van.  He didn't bother to tell us it would not be white--it was all blue with no writing on it identifying it with Mega.  So of course he went right by us and we didn't recognize it to flag down the driver.  Where we were waiting was a few hundred yards from where he eventually pulled over and called us.  So hard to hussle those few hundred yards with all our luggage.  They are just not competent in giving clear directions on how to make the connection for pickup, and their vans are unprofessional.  This is their only job (beyond keeping the cars safe in their lot) and you'd think they would be really good at this.

Customer care and providing an experience that lessens stress on the traveler do not seem a priority for Mega.  I'll pay more in the future and use another company.< /review><time>1575529031821</time>< rate>

<UserId.>102531938568335310909<//UserId.><Review>Left a dent on our car after we picked up and refused to make an insurance claim to fix it. This place is garbage. They parked our car so close to the chainlink fence that it left scratches on the bumper. It's crazy too, because our car has a rear view camera and beeps when you get close to anything. On top of that, the guy pulling our car out burned the clutch so bad. Clearly not an experienced manual driver. Be careful. The cheap parking wasn't so cheap after my $500 deductible.< /Review>< Pictures>

Don't, don't, don't. The free dollars you save is NOT worth it. Waited over 2 hours to be picked up and my friend was yelled at in the phone by the driver. We were at the correct spot, they told us to go somewhere else then had is go back to out original pickup spot.< /text>

GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!! I used their shuttle van to get to the Airport. Got in an accident.

The driver rammed into another vehicle when he created a 2nd lane on a 1 lane road. Instead of providing information about their auto insurance. The driver told us to get an uber. They lost my keys when I returned, still refused to give me auto insurance information.

I contacted the police & got my keys & car back 1 1/2 hours after I arrived (11:30pm)

<Text>Parking was cheap and I chose to park here despite the reviews. How bad an it be? The way to the airport was great. We pulled up waited for about 10minutes and we were on our way. This was Sunday at 5am.
Returning the next Sunday, we waited 40 minutes and called to see where the van was. they were trying to argue that we just called. I have time records on my phone. Initial call was 9 22 pm. It’s 10 25 and we are finally in the van going to get our car. Never again. It’s cheap but I could have been home by now for 25.00 more. Not worth it!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Absolutely horrible!! I will NOT park my car here again. I should have known by how sketchy the lot was when I pull up. They damaged my car and left ashes on the floor on the driver side, I am not a smoker. Now I can't get a return call or email about the damage to my car. I reported  the damage to the smart@$$ attendant immediately and he was rude and had no clue.< /review><Time>1530889816543</Time><Rate>1</Rate>< username>

Our flight into LAX arrived at 11:55 pm and we called them as soon as we got our luggage. The dispatcher told us that there was an accident on Century that would delay them for 45 minutes. I thought that was odd as they are only 15 minutes from the airport. We over heard 2 other couples complaining about waiting for Mega, and I checked google maps, ways, and my EMS dispatch app, and all showed clear traffic on Century. At that point we called Mega and they refused to pick up. After waiting over an hour (the other couples were close to an hour and a half) we managed to flag down a taxi van and took it to Mega. The employee there, who was not who we had spoken to on the phone, informed us that he had just got to work to find the phone ringing, numerous messages on the machine, and drivers sitting around. He was very apologetic, and took down notes from each of us while telling us to contact Terry the next day for a refund. I called first thing in the morning, and was told that Terry would be working 10-4. I was unable to call back until a little before 3, and was told that he had already left for the day. I called again the next day and actually managed to speak with him, only to have him inform me that he would have to talk to his manager, Daniel. Terry assured me that he would call me back before he left that evening. He did not. The following day I was once again very busy at work and was unable to call until 2pm. The employee who answered let me know that both Terry and Daniel had already left, there were no other supervisors or managers were available, and none would be for the next 3 days (They would be back on Monday). So far I am looking at a full week to even find out if this company will even consider a refund, which is looking less and less likely given how their management treats customers.

Do yourself a big favor. Spend a few more dollars and park somewhere else. It will actually save you time and money in the long run.< /Text>< user_name>

Recent bad experience, more than 1 hour wait time, receptionist was rude, I asked why they say they are coming to, but it’s taken 1 hour, he says you know how it is, you have to work here to know. We called back many times, phone is always busy. I say what happen to your free shuttle service you promise, I’ve been waiting a long time, I’ll have to find my own ride. His response was rude, he says go ahead and find your own way!
So I hung up the car home after the told him we will never use his service anymore
Too bad, he has lost a customer of 5 years
If you don’t want to be short changed or taken advantage of, please do not use Mega Airport Parking<//Text>

Don’t do it unless you absolutely have to. Self parking was advertised. Not true! I don’t know where they parked my car, but upon picking it up,  5 days later, the window was open and there were tree branches on my floorboard. Oh yeah, something kept crawling on my face near my eyes on the drive home. Upon arriving, I discovered what appeared to be, thousands of ANTS!!!!! All over my floorboards, seats, center console. Everywhere! I had to get my vacuum cleaner and vacuum them up! They just kept coming and coming! I ended up having to Raid my car interior. It was the worst experience! Especially the crawling ants on me!!! Gross! I’m itchy just writing about the experience! That’s what I get for trying to save a few dollars. Not worth it. It’s back to the Parking Spot next time.<//text>

Unprofessional and shady! PARK AT YOUR OWN RISK! We left our 2019 Pathfinder here for a week over Thanksgiving 2019. We come back and the Mega team dented and scraped the rear passenger side. It was late and we were told to call and talk to the manager Tarry. Three weeks now of trying both via phone and email. No response. They always tell you the manager will be there in 20 mins and call back. You WILL NEVER speak to a manager. Terrible business DO NOT park here.</Review>

You get what you pay for I guess.   Needed to order and Uber to get to airport so the cost savings was eaten up.   Driver left and wasn't back for far too long.

Also, don't pre-tip the drivers , which I also did by stupid mistake.</text>

Don't be fooled by the cheap prices. You will regret parking here, trust me. This place has the absolute worst service. They don't pick up the phone, lie about wait times, take forever to pick you up and have the trashiest "shuttle" van I have ever seen. I landed at LAX at midnight and called them right away. They told me 20 minutes and to wait outside. 40 minutes passed and I called them, no answer. I called back 10 minutes later, no answer. They finally show up an hour later and then when I get to the lot my car isn't even pulled up. There is only one guy working and then he pulls around some random car and hands me the keys. It wasn't even my car. Then I have to wait 10 more minutes for him to find my car. I didn't even leave until 30 minutes later. I will NEVER use them again. I warn everyone to stay far away from this place.</text>

<text>Cheap place to park your car? Yes. Worth it? No! I’m waiting over an hour for them to pick me up from the airport! I keep calling and they’re saying 5-7 minutes every 30 minutes. Everyone around me has literally been picked up and I’m just standing here waiting. This place is definitely not worth it & to make matters worse when I called they asked me did I have my keys!!! They’re suppose to have my keys!!! Plus the parking lot looks sketchy. Don’t do business here.< /text>< pictures>

I should have listened to the others. Bad location. Too far from the airport. Worse shuttle service and shuttle vehicles. No AC and the driver seems to not care if it worked or not.
If you save a couple of dollars, you lost a lot of time catching up your plane..
Also we got droped at he arrival. Not departure. And I was told by the driver that they are not allowed or have permission to go to the departure. Which  sucks and had to take the elevator upstairs to departure as we were dropped at the arrivals.< /Text>

WARNING: The shuttles don’t run every 15 minutes - in fact that claim is laughable. We called for the shuttle and was quoted 25 minutes. IT TOOK AN HOUR.

Unless you’re absolutely desperate, pay the extra couple bucks for literally any other parking service.</review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>The only (and I mean only) good thing about this place is that it's cheap. If you literally can't spend more money, your option is this place. They have a shuttle that is free, although it comes whenever it wants.

It's a 10 minute drive to the airport, but they spent 45 minutes getting to our terminal after a late-night flight. On top of that, they park vehicles too close for comfort, and claim zero responsibility for damages (after they park your own car). My car had a flat when I got it back (screw in the tire), so I was up at 1:00 a.m. swapping a spare on.

On top of all of that, their service is terrible. Upon arrival, they were rude, seemed uninterested in our business, ubrasive, and didn't explain anything. They just kind of ordered us around.

So, cheap, rude, might damage your car, not worth it.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2b68eb2d098bf:0x2609648acc981133<//GmapID></record>

<text>This is a parking place where you pull in, leave your keys, and they park your car for you then keep the keys for the duration of your trip. The lot is fenced and the area has an industrial and somewhat dilapidated vibe but it's totally unrealistic to expect more at the really low daily rate ($5-7 per day).

When dropping off your car: You pull up and talk with the attendant in a small office, leave your keys with him/her, unload your bags, and get taken to the airport in a 15 passenger van. (I prepaid online, but I believe you can pay on the spot.) At LAX, they drop you off on the lower level at the designated spot in whichever terminal you'd like.
[We arrived on a Saturday at 1:45 pm and got to the airport at 2:05 pm.]

When getting picked up at the airport: you call the number and tell the attendant your ticket number. (I suggest taking a photo of it because if you lose it, they can't bring up your car before hand, it might be double parked, etc. etc.) They tell you when the next shuttle will be there and where to wait (at LAX, it's at the red "Hotel Shuttles" stop on the lower level) and then they pick you up in a white 15 passenger van.
[We called on a Monday at 2:39 pm, got out to the curb 2:54 pm, and picked up before 3:00 pm. We got to Mega Airport Parking at 3:15 pm.]

I gave 4 our 5 stars due to the really dirty 15 passenger vans. It's probably been two years since they were last cleaned, and it showed everywhere: the fabric of the seats, windows, seat belt straps, carpet, door handles, etc. Tolerable for short distances but not much more :)

Overall I recommend because the price is so low, IF you have the patience to add 20 minutes *minimum* each to your departure and arrival. Also, I interacted with 3 people in the office and 2 drivers and everyone was polite and easy to understand.<//text>< Time>

<text>1. Don't take your nice car here 2. Don't expect quick pickup from airport. 3. allow extra hour before and after. (Pickup shuttle to & from airport)  it is not horrible BUT if you can afford to pay a couple of bucks more or book your parking in advance, I would use 105 or 405 parking.<//text><username>Frank Safavieh</username>< Resp>

<Review>The good news is the price is low and they have a shuttle to take you to the airport and pick you up.  You turn in your keys and they give you a claim ticket with instructions.  The lot is located in a shady(not good) area.  The transport van was dirty, old, had a dented fender, and signage was minimal but the transport drivers were friendly enough.  The lot staff was unorganized and discombobulated.  It took close to 30 minutes to retrieve my car upon arrival.  Another lady stated she waited 90 minutes to get picked up because she was told to look for a blue van, but a white van was being used.  She had to take a lyft to the parking lot at midnight.  You get a good price but be prepared to wait a long time to get your car returned.</Review><user_name>Flavio Berny<//user_name><userid>106535708611108072333</userid></record></dataset><record>

This is the worst ever parking place I used ,they have no customer service skill , attitude they lie about there pick up and drop off I had to wait in the airport 45 min. and I had to call twice for some one to tell me when they will show up. They asked me to get my lug age up stairs to the departure level for them to pick me up, the shuttle they have is bad van  broken and damaged filthy  unsafe  to be on the road, stay away I park at the air port area at least once a month this is the night mirror experience.</text>

Nope. Don't do it.
I know it's cheap, but we were almost late to our flight because the driver took a long break when he got to the parking lot, which was longer than we thought.
On the pick up we ended up getting a Lyft - 50 minutes and 3 calls (each with a promise of they will be there in 10-20 minutes) later.
If you are gonna do this lot don't tip the driver at the beginning and just use that money to get a ride share back to the lot after you land. Oh and come early in case the driver takes a break when he gets there.<//review>

<text>Fiasco they had the first shuttle packed up to brim back luggage and people like sardines. Let an elderly couple waiting 40 mins go on ahead. They do not pick up their phone, they know they have bad service. It’s difficult after a long flight and trying to get home to wait almost and additional hour to get to your car. We had a 10 year old tired and asking when the shuttle was coming. If your a parent, single, or elderly be warned. Drop off good p/up very bad.</text><userid>116407598459540965057< /userid></record>

<review>Very unprofessional. The drivers and the staff were nice but the management is horrible . We waited over an hour ! Once I called to notify the manager he was unprofessional and unapologetic.

Save yourself the headache, pay the extra $10 and  book with another parking garage. I will never be booking with Mega Parking Lot again.< /review></record>

This is a quick and easy review.
Don’t park here unless you us an Uber to get you to and from the airport. The prices are very good however the shuttle is very very very slow. You will be late to your flight trust me.Other than the shuttle issue the service was great.< /Review>

They take a really long time to pick up from airport 25-35 minutes.  Then they’re about 15-20 minute drive away from airport. So to get from airport to your car add another hour to travel time. However it is the cheapest parking lot around LAX. If getting to your car quick is not an issue then I suggest this place.<//text>

My passenger was waiting 1:35 hour to be picked up in LAX Airport finally at 9:40 they picked him up. There will be no excuses for this poor service when you arrived to the Airport and very tired you just want to get your car and go home to your family
Not answering their phones is another thing when you are frustrated  and want to ask what is going on ! Why no one is coming to pick me up.</Text>

This was the worst parking service ever. They lie on their website that they’re 2 miles away from their airport just to get business. They’re 30 mins away and it’s in a very sketchy, completely full parking lot. The worst part was that they didn’t refund our reservation. It may cost 1 or 2$ cheaper, but I will personally pay whoever can’t afford the extra dollar for a much closer and non-sketchy parking lot. TERRIBLE LIARS.</Text>

Plan on waiting a long time to be picked up by shuttle in a van with no air on a 80°+ day. First and last time going here. I'll use the hotel parking for $10 a day any time over using them again. This place is not run efficiently at all.

Please find somewhere else to park your car. His place sucks and if I could leave negative stars I would. They told me 20 minutes and when that went by I called back and was called a big fat liar. My calls time stamp. Very rude very rude. Horrible customer service. Driver almost killed us on the way back. No regard for safety at all. Avoid at all costs!!! It’s not worth your life.<//Text>

One shuttle. Let me repeat that. One shuttle to and from the airport. I waited over 40 minutes. They also only have one phone line so when you call it rings and goes to voicemail.</Text>

4/24: I prepaid online (ONLY $7 PER DAY!) I arrived at 5:30 p.m. on a Thursday. I checked in at the office which was quick and easy, and the van took myself and one other person right to the airport. It's only about 10 minutes away from LAX and they have nice vans. The driver played music and chatted with us.
4/28: Flight arrived at 8 a.m. on Monday morning. I called upon arriving and the shuttle was there in 18 minutes. No other pickups, so we left LAX right away. When we arrived at the lot, my car had been pulled up in the line of cars ready for pickup.

Literally could not be more pleased. I already made a reservation for the next time I need parking for LAX, and can't wait.
Without hesitation, I recommend that you give them a try.< /Review>

< Review>
I called the shuttle just as instructed and they told me 20 minutes max. When I called back after 30 minutes they said he was in the airport. When I called back after 40 minutes they hung up on me 3 times, then when they picked up I asked if they would be coming because it seemed too long. The person said "are you calling me a liar?" Then told me to get my own uber to the lot. I have never been treated so badly and I park at LAX at least 7 times a year. AVOID THIS LOT. I have never written a review before, but this was appalling.<//Review>

Would have done 4 or 5 stars with the exception of long wait for shuttle (45 minutes). I ended up saving $40-$60 so you have to weigh the savings here. You pay half the price as many long term parking. It is not self parking as they will park it for you and you leave your keys with them. When I got to the shuttle I had to call a couple times (no answer) but noticed it was a cell phone so I sent a text with my location and in about 5 minutes they responded what my ticket number was. Once the shuttle arrived my car was out front ready to go. So other than a run down shuttle van and long wait for shuttle everything was good. If I don't want to deal with the long wait I will pay double next time.</text>

Dropped my car off, found the person working asleep on a couch. Come back, everything seems fine, but then I find out one of the staff paired their phone to my car and had been driving around, in turn adding over 100 miles to my odometer. Still have not had a resolution, but won't be surprised if I have to get outside parties involved. I have photos and paperwork to support my claims.<//text>

<review>I used that place once, and I can't complain,  they were great. I  arrived,   they parked my car and took me to the airport immediately. When I  came back I called them  from the airport, they came pick me up and when we  arrived at the lot my car was parked waiting for me to leave.
The staff was very helpful and friendly. They are little far from the airport but
Their fees are  very reasonable.
Definitely I will use their services again.</review><rate>5<//rate>< Gmap_id>

Worst experience I’ve ever had with airport parking. Unprofessional, unresponsive. They leave you hanging at the airport, I called them multiple times to check status of the ride, no answer, no responses to text messages. When I finally got ahold of them, they were super rude and blamed it on a shift change with no communication. They wanted me to meet them at the other end of the airport, I ended up just taking a lyft. Unreliable. Will never park here again and will make sure none of my friends and family are treated like this.< /Text>

AVOID THIS LOT AT ALL COSTS! This place is a dump!  It deserves a “0.”  The staff are rude and irresponsible!  My car was detailed just before arrival, but when I got it back, it looked like it had been parked in a swamp.  When we complained, the attendant abusively yelled at us and initially refused window cleaner to clean almost opaque windows. OH, DID I MENTION THE ANT INFESTATION?  The critters keep emerging.  I have pictures.  The van we rode in had a check engine light on; low tire warning indicator; was banged up; and the driver was talking on his hand-held cell phone (against the law).  We almost were in an accident with a 24’ truck on a back-alley “short-cut.”  NEVER AGAIN!< /Text>

There was no problem it could have been a 5 star rating if their van was better. It was so hot when I was picked up at the airport and the van’s air condition was not working. The staff needs to improve customer service. Not a friendly staff in the office<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b68eb2d098bf:0x2609648acc981133</Gmap_id></record>

Well the van that pick us up and takes us to the airport is falling apart. The trim in the van hit my in the face now I have to hold it up the whole ride there. Only reason I’m giving it two stars was because the guy who checked me in was super nice.< /review>

I'm not sure I would park here again, but it was decent for the price I paid. I didn't know I would be leaving my keys, I do not remember reading that in the reviews, so that could be on me for not remembering. The Van does not have any logos to indicate Mega Parking , it is a basic multi passenger white van that has "Airtime" on the right rear end. The Driver just pulled up to the airport shuttle pick up area, he did not get out the vehicle or anything (even though I called, so they knew I was at that terminal). I had to open the side door and ask if he was Mega Parking. Also, on the way back, the driver was looking at his phone/text messages. I definitely did not feel safe with that.< /Text>

What an amazing value for money! I don't know why people would rate it low. I have parked here many times, never a scratch or a missing item. The shuttles are relatively prompt and take about 15 minutes to LAX. The attendants are courteous. For about $6-$7 a day, this is mindbogglingly great!< /review>

<Text>Very friendly staff! Everyone we dealt with was kind and personable and made an effort to connect with us as customers!

Truck was in the same shape we left it in when we arrived back! And, as promised it was ready and waiting for us when we arrived.

The price we paid for the parking was very reasonable.

The downsides:

The back of the truck was covered in ants which made their way into the cab when we arrived and, therefore, we were killing ants on our stuff and our person the entire drive home.

The wait time to be picked up at the airport was long. It was one hour to the minute from when we called them. And the shuttle was a bit sketchy. But it got us where we needed to go and we appreciate that.

It was NOT self park as the site claimed.

The site mentioned an oversized truck fee if the truck exceeded a certain size. Ours did not but we were charged anyway. We were fine to do it because we would’ve preferred a larger space anyway after seeing how over crowded the lot was.

The person parking our diesel truck was unaware that diesels require certain extra steps to start up (necessary to avoid engine damage) and needed to be showed that, and other “how to’s” on the vehicle which didn’t give us a lot of confidence in their ability to manage and care for our vehicle. It’s understandable that diesels may not be common in that area however, if you insist on parking someone else’s vehicle you should have some knowledge of basic operation of most vehicles.

Overall, I’m happy-ish with our experience, the cost was very reasonable and I appreciate the staff most of all.</Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Absolutely horrible service!! You drop your cars off in a very sketchy lot and they park them so close to other cars. We watched them door ding 3 cars while we were there. Then The beat up van ride to the airport was very scary. Driver didn’t obey any signs was speeding almost at unsafe speed taking corners and was rude. Then when got back to Los Angeles had to wait 2 and half hours for them to get a van to pick up 2 people. After waiting 2 hours when I called the guy back asking where it was he said “ you wait til I have time to get there” and then he hung up on me before I could reply. We ended up getting a Lyft which was only $14.00 to get there. Would never recommend Mega Parking to anyone at all!!! Very horrible customer service. We got our car back and it has 2 good size door dings in it and when we told them about it they said it wasn’t them. I would recommend if you do go here to take pics of your car before so they are held accountable. There were 3 other customers in there also complaining of door dents and 1 of them had a good size fender dent! Be aware!!!!</Review><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

NEVER USE!!!!!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!! Used them for our recent trip. Never picked us up after waiting an hour, and our tire was flat when they gave us the keys. They could care less. Btw, the tire was brand new. Please pay the extra money to make sure your car is safe.< /review>

<Name>Joana Ramirez<//Name><Review>Worst experience of my life, not worth what you are “saving”  !!!! Person on the phone is rude and disrespectful, drop off and or pick up times they provide you with are completely incorrect. It takes them about an hour and a half to pick you up even though they say it will be 20 mins. Just an overall nightmare. I am not a difficult person but with this situation I was particularly irritated and asked to speak to the owner or supervisor, but he “did not” know their number and hung up. Completely terrible experience!!!<//Review>< GmapID>

These are good dudes -- really nice guys running the place.  The place is close to the airport and the price is really good.  They pick you up and drop you off.  The pick up can be a little delayed, but it's not bad.  Really couldn't ask for or expect much more.  Highly recommend.  I've used them a couple of times now and plan to continue.< /Review>

<text>Worst Parking Experience EVER! These guys were Indian. I'm from the same region as well. And that usually accounts for us getting a better service than most. When you called for pick up from the Terminal. They were incredibly rude. And they were forcing me to take Uber instead. And when I said that Ill wait. They didn't tell me a pick-up time. I waited for an Hour an Half. And When I got to the lot and complained to the Cashier. He told me: "Meet me Outside" basically threatening to beat me up for complaining. And then after I left. The employee misused my personal information (Phone Number) to call from the company phone to threaten me again and verbally abuse me. And when I called the Manager (Terry) to complain. He did not take my complaint seriously. I also found out that they overcharged me by $4.48. If they could do this to me (a person of their own race and color), Imagine what they will do to you.  Stay AWAY!!!<//text>< rate>

< Review>
This place is by far my favourite spot to park when going at LAX.  They are cheaper  and give very often a better service. Sure enough the ride to the airport it is in an old Econoline,  but who cares it is within five minutes to the airport.  The waiting time for pick up upon the return is always very reasonable.  Your car is always waiting for you at the front door when you come back.

Some might be concerned to leave their keys with them.  I have done the test multiple times and checked my mileage before and after.  No worries to have on that aspect.  Keep up the good work Mega parking!< /Review>

Great experience, I was picked up in 15 minutes after I called them , which was a big relief after 12 hours flight. Not a fancy place but the price was cheap and people were nice ,specially the driver was helpful.
I definitely recommend this place.< /Text>

DO NOT PARK HERE!! first, it looks like a junk yard when you pull in, only 1 person at the desk doing everything, we waited over 30 min to be taken to the airport and an hour to be picked up after our trip when it says "every 15 min." They charged us $3 more per day when we got there cuz we were in a truck. And what made me the most mad was when the guy driving the shuttle pretty much yelled at us saying "we're not an ambulance" (because my daughter is in a wheelchair) he wanted us to drop her off at the airport first and then go back to drop off our car. IDIOT!! he didnt even have to do anything cuz we carried her into the shuttle and loaded the wheelchair ourselves. I will spread the word through every way possible, this is the biggest joke of a business!! I didnt even get what I paid for! So upset!!</text>

If i could give less than one star I would. We called once we landed at LAX to be picked up and were told it would be 45 Mins and to wait @ the red curb. I called them at 50 Minutes and they said they were not coming and to catch an Uber and they would pay for it. Another 30 Minutes until we were able to get an Uber (an hour and half to get to my car). The company said they would refund our 20 dollar Uber ride but have not. I would not use this company terrible service and not truthful!!< /Text>

When we initially arrived I could tell that something was going to go wrong.  The two guys behind the counter  were like night and day.  One was okay and courteous but the other was very rude and condescending. Needless to say we were in a rush and had no other options so we left our car there. The shuttle driver was very courteous and accommodating  he deserves all the stars.  Upon our return  our experience with mega parking turned into a mega failure , a mega nightmare, and in mega disappointment . We were told that they would not send shuttle for only 4 persons. We were told that I would get a phone call when they decided to send a shuttle for us. The call never came and we had to pay an extra $25 plus $5 tip for taxi ride from LAX to the parking lot. When we arrived at parking lot, we were told to wait for my car to arrive but after 20 minutes of waiting outside in the cold with my wife and kids, found my car keys still sitting on the counter. I demanded my keys and had to hunt for my own car to find it backed up into tree branches and all scratched up.  Mega failure. Avoid at all costs.<//Review>

I stored my truck there for 16 days. The service was efficient, quick in and quick out without making you feel rushed.
The people who worked there were very nice and made sure we understood where to stand and who to call for pickup when we returned to LAX.
My truck had the same mileage as when I dropped it off and we were offered free drinks when we were checking out the vehicle.

To summarize:
Efficient service, Courteous employees, and Inexpensive. They will definitely have my business in the future.

(note: I don't think I was the only person who felt that way as the lot was full when I returned to from my vacation)< /Text>

<review>If I could leave a zero, that would be a more accurate description of my experience.

I was a customer from 8/2-8/4.

I chose your establishment because I have parked here before and the price was great until this past Sunday.

When i called for the shuttle, it took 6 calls before I was able to reach someone.

Upon arriving at the lot, i saw my car had been pulled up and i saw the scratch on my driver's side door before I was even close to the car.

The scratch was deep enough to even remove the paint. I was obviously furious because that is not the condition of the vehicle when I left friday morning.

I spoke with a gentleman and he said just tall to him, referring to Nick. He seemed overwhelmed, like he didn't know how to respond. They were both overall, unconcerned and said someone would email me back in about a week,  which is a totally unacceptable time frame.

I asked for the manager and was told it was Danny but he would be in on Monday 8/5 between 9-12. I called around 11am and was told he wouldn't be in until 1pm. So i called around 245pm. I got no response or call back even though I left a message.

I want the damage that was done to my vehicle while in your care, repaired as soon as possible and this issue should be a priority. The fact that it seems unimportant to your company is unethical and quite frankly,  disgraceful.  I will never be doing business with you again. And as someone who travels frequently, I will be sharing my horrific experience on all platforms.

Updated 8/8/19

To date; after emailing, calling and leaving numerous voicemails, Danny the manager ( or anyone for that matter has yet to reach out to me regarding the damage that was done to my vehicle). Btw the email listed on the website is null and void. (God forbid you need to get in touch with them.)

I called again tonight hoping to catch him as he never seems to be in office when other employees said he would be.

I left a personal message with Nick, whom I spoke with on Sunday for him to return my call immediately. He said Danny should be in office tomorrow between 8a-12p.

I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau tomorrow morning to report them and if I don't receive a call back the next call to Danny will be from my attorney.

It is downright deplorable the way this company has handled this situation.

Update 8/9/19

Called twice this morning, in hopes of getting in touch with the manager Danny, since I have received zero communication from them much less an apology from anyone.

The first time I called, I was told to try back in 30 minutes and Danny would be in. I called back and was told that Danny was not in but was told to speak to a supervisor named Terry. I tried to express my frustrations to him about the situation and the overall lack of response but he was combative and kept cutting me off which was infuriating. I informed him that I needed Danny's last name, to which he replied he didn't know. (Who doesn't know their boss's last name?) I then asked for his full name and he began yelling at me and telling me he doesn't need to provide that info and that he has the highest service ratings on their site. (I'm not sure how or why he thought that was an appropriate response.) The sheer ignorance and negligence of this company is unacceptable. I have since filed a complaint with the better business bureau with legal action to follow.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2b68eb2d098bf:0x2609648acc981133< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
At first arriving at Mega airport parking it seemed like a fine place to park.  We arrived at 9:00 p.m. and had a 10:35 p.m. flight.  On arrival of the parking lot, we told them what time our flight flew out and they told us we would leave shortly.  We then waited for 20 min and were the last ones to be dropped off by the shuttle, which caused us to be at the airport and checking in at 9:48, so we were therefore not allowed to check our luggage in and missed our flight.  On returning, we waited 30 minutes for the shuttle to pick us up to take us back to the parking lot.  When we arrived at the parking lot one of the workers ran to get our car.  My husband could see that he was having a hard time getting our car out of the tight spot and started to walk down there.  As he was walking down there he watched the worker hit the car next to ours.  When my husband got even closer to our car he could see that our truck had been also hit in the front bumper.  We had a manager come out and he was no help.  We had the police come and nothing could be done because it was private property.  We received the owners number and never got a call back.  So, needless to say we were stuck with $561 in damage.  As we looked around many cars had dings and dents in them.  It looks like the workers there may just play bumper cars with our vehicles.  Also, as we were dealing with a manager another customer approached him about never being picked up from the airport and she had to take a taxi to get to the parking lot.  We had two other friends that went on vacation with us and they parked here as well.  When they returned one waited 2 hours for the shuttle to pick them up and one waited 20 min then took a taxi and when she arrived they couldn't find her keys.  This place it horrible and I would NEVER recommend this parking lot!!!</Review>

I saw plenty of 100k plus cars in their lot, safe and secure. Multiple shuttles for pick up & drop off. Fast service 24 Hour operation. Recommended for parking for extended international trips.

You absolutely get what you pay for with this horrible parking service.

When I land, i looked up the number on the card you get when you initially drop off your car. I called several times to no avail. It either went straight to voicemail or rang multiple times and hung up on me. After 15 minutes of trying to get a hold of them, they tell me they will send a driver which should pick me up in about 15 minutes. After waiting an additional 35 minutes, i call back to see where the driver is. Takes me about another 5 more minutes to actually reach them. The woman on the phone(who sounded like she could not care less about how long i've been waiting) says the guy is on his way. In all from my initial call to the driver actually picking me up, it takes about an hour. Ridiculous!

So i get back to the parking lot and my car is literally nowhere to be found. The guy manning the desk has no clue where my car is located and is out walking around trying to search for my car. I had told him that the key fob doesn't work so you can't press it to sound the alarm. After I confirm from the guy that he has no idea where my car is, i decide to go out and look for it myself. Of course it's almost midnight and every car looks the same. After 10 more minutes of looking for my car, i finally find it.

Definitely the worst service i've experienced. I urge anyone to pay a little more for a reputable parking service. This place is not worth it!</text>

I had a great experience here. I had a special request for the way I wanted to be billed and was calling around all the parking places to see if they could accommodate it. I spoke to 2 other parking facilities and they both snubbed me.

When I called Mega Airport Parking, the gentleman I spoke with asked me to come down directly without making an appointment and speak to a manager there. Even though I was hesitant, I decided to try it out. To my pleasant surprise, the guy I spoke with was the Manager himself and was able to get me what I needed without a hassle and within a few minutes.

Drop off to the airport was smooth inspite of the congestion.

When I returned, the pick up driver could not spot me under the sign, but he still hung around for a minute and called me to ask me where I was. That saved me almost 40 minutes of frustration and time. While being driven to the parking lot, I even got a call to make sure I had been picked up.

When I returned to the parking lot, my car was ready for me to drive out.

Great job guys ! Couldn't have asked for a better experience.</review>

Price is good, but it is not self park as third party vendor stated. You have to leave your keys. Their white pick-up van is a little old & the seat belt for the 3rd row passenger seat did not work & the driver was very aggressive!  I will try another place next time or take the Fly-Away Bus from Union Station via the Metro Gold Line.< /Text>

I WILL NEVER PARK HERE AGAIN!!!!!! Worst place to park!!! Parking lot was very full and crowded and the shuttle that takes you to the airport was so dirty that I didn’t even want to sit on the seats. When I arrived back at the airport i called them for a pick up and it took AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES for them to pick me up! I am very dissatisfied with this place! It is definitely worth paying a little more money somewhere else then to deal with this horrible service.<//Review>

You get what you pay for. Arrived at 1:07pm. Finally leaving at 1:47pm for the airport. Was reassured by the manager that the shuttle would be here in 5 minutes or soon every few minutes.

I’m scared to think about what the return trip will be like but at this point I’m out of options.< /review>

Picked up in a beat up old van with a handwritten sign saying MEGA. I'm pretty sure driving and talking and looking at your cell phone is illegal but the driver kept looking at his phone as we are careening through traffic.

They are the cheapest for a reason. If you don't mind risking your family's life 👪 and you don't mind waiting an hour or so then this is your place. Otherwise I would use Joe's Parking, Wally Park, any other service. Read the reviews so you know what you are getting in to.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

The website shows a rate of $7, they charge $13 as they said their website ia outdated.

The parking lot itself it’s dark and shady, the attendants do not walk around it so the vehicles are not really watched for.<//text>

<Review>I LOVE this place. Has saved my life so many times for cheap!! Just drive in, pay $7.95 a day, they park your car, you hop in their complementary van and your off to vacation mode. Upon arrival give them a call they pick you up from airport and drop you off back. Your car will be waiting for you with the keys in the ignition. If I could give this place 10 stars I would!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Run! Horriable Service. Our shuttle took over 40 mins to pick us up and take us to LAX. The driver dropped us off at the wrong terminal causing us to miss our flight. This left my family of 9 stranded at LAX. This causing us not a great start to our family Vacation!!!!<//text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>So we arrived back in the States a few days ago after spending 30 days in Southeast Asia to find out our truck had been burglarized. Before we left, we had spent the prior week at Disneyland and so we departed from LAX. I had called various parking lots to see who can give us a good price for 30 days of parking. I found a place that quoted like $250 for the month which was fair. Many places were $10+ per day. The manager (Manny) then asks me how I'd be paying and I replied by credit card. He then offered a large discount if I paid cash... $200 so I jumped on it.

Upon landing and retrieving our luggage at LAX, we shuttle'd a trip back to the parking lot. I opened the tailgate lid of our Tundra and notice everything is missing. Here's the sad part: All the kids Christmas presents, including the wife's was there... plus all our clothes and gear for the next three months for Phoenix where we spend the winters, electronics, computers and other business equipment/supplies. Estimated loss of $5500, probably more. Really feel violated. How could someone be so...?

I'm really kicking myself. I ignored poor reviews, parking lot owner wanted to accept keys and park the vehicle themselves, but I didn't want to hand over keys so I self-parked (since I had valuables in the truck). They initially told me to park in the middle of the driveway at the entrance which I thought was weird, so I asked for a more discreet spot. Damn! I asked if it was safe here, and the manager said "oh yeah, absolutely". When I arrived at night, I only then saw all the lighting in the parking lot was out, like not working. No security camera and in hindsight, my truck was an easy target. I called the police. Sgt said the area was full of transient and homeless people and they often get calls of vehicles burglarized. Unfortunately, I didn't read any of this in the reviews before parking there. Most of the negative reviews were about long shuttle waiting times. This sucks.

We're scrambling to make up the lost Christmas gifts. They were gifts acquired from "deals" sites over the past year. As far as the parking lot, all I can do is leave reviews warning others of the impending safety of their vehicle while parked at this lot. Shouldn't the parking lot owners be somewhat culpable since I paid them to park in their private parking spot? It's not like I parked on a public street.< /Text>< pictures>

Perfect, flawless! Good service, friendly, fast, and easy.

Front desk rushed to get me to the airport to catch my flight.

On the return, picked up within minutes from the airport, and my car was out front ready for me, keys in the ignition.

Couldn't ask for more.</text>

I was skeptical at first after seeing an average of 3 out of 5 star reviews.

I have used this service once and I am about to use it again tomorrow, so I will update again in the future.

The one time that I did use it, however, everything went quite well. Got there in ample time, just in case any issues (ex. shuttle problems) were to perspire. Shuttle came within 15-20 minutes and took me straight to my gate. While I was waiting for the shuttle I had the urge to use the bathroom. To my surprise this lot actually had a bathroom for customers and it was quite clean.

On my way back from the airport there was a bit of a delay for the shuttle to pick me up (probably took 30-45 minutes), but for me that wasn't necessarily a big issue because at this point I had no time constraints nor any place to be. For me, the biggest concern is getting to the airport on-time.

Anyway, for my first time it was exactly what I needed: an affordable & reliable parking/shuttle service.<//Review>

Prepaid for self parking. I was told getting there I have to leave my keys. Horrible customer service and rude. Didnt get all money money back. Avoid this place, not worth the few dollars you might be saving. I parked elsewhere.<//Review>

<review>You get less than you pay for believe it or not.  Unless you have an extra hour to kill going and coming, dont bother.  The shuttle service is horrific.  You would be better off calling an Uber to and from their parking lot.  The shuttles are falling apart and the scheduling of pickups is terrible.  The first shuttle we called came in 30 minutes and was full and the second came 30 minutes after that.

Horrible experience.  I'm only giving one star because that's the minimum.</review><Name>Anthony Jones<//Name><time>1554772965641</time><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Horrible.  The shuttle does not leave every 10-15mins, you can't self park either.  All false advertisement. Be careful.<//Text>

Even after reading all the negative reviews, I decided to try them on a 16 day trip. Even brought my old 99 Odyssey so even if they scratch my van, it won't really matter much. However, driving from Vegas, I needed to bring my old 20 buck power inverter for phone charging. I placed it in the glove compartment and locked it.  This place advertised as a self park place but that's not true. They insisted that they must have the key even if there were still empty spots when we got there. That in itself should have been a flag. Anyways, when we got back, sure enough, my inverter was gone. Obvious signs of scrounging cause I always keep my glove in a certain order. And they forgot to lock it back. No signs of break in. I am certain it was them. Who else.

I wanted to write a formal complaint to the owner but the multiple manager said that it was useless and they are not responsible for stolen items only outside car damage. I told them that if I kept my key then I would understand. Counter guy will not even give me a complaint form to write on.

The shuttle was another thing. I did not mind the old beat up van but no ac or ventilation was a very hot uncomfortable ride to and from LAX. Considering this was mid December.

BTW, the other guy that got picked up with us had his car scratched up.

All I can do was yell at these people.

PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE.  YOU WILL FIND NO SAVINGS HERE SINCE THEY WILL EITHER STEAL SOMETHING FROM YOUR CAR OR SCRATCH IT UP.

This will be my first and last long term parking in LAX.<//Text><date>1484156821364<//date></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
You'll pay a $5.00 processing fee going in and another $5.00 processing fee going out.  So any discounts are a way to hide that fee.  PLUS... I'm so thankful that my good Lord helped me keep my mouth shut when we got our car back.  These are the RUDEST people I have dealt with, they will CRAM you into their 70 year old vans that have metal on metal brakes, they will literally YELL at you on the phone and pretend they have no idea what (example) Delta 3G location means when you're telling them where you are, they yelled at my wife on the phone when she could not understand their idea of what English is!  NEVER again.  I called to find out why the double service fee and guess what, they did not call back after I was told they would do so!! Pay the extra fee for a better parking lot!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>

This place is sketchy as HELL!! We pull up and it's all closed up, I had to call them to open the gate. We dropped off my husbands car for a week while we go on our honeymoon. Come back to LAX to pick up his car. We call for pick up & the driver RACES BACK TO THE PARKING LOT!! He ran a red light and was practically SKIDDING thru our the airport & thru the streets!! We get there, our car is pulled up in the front....WITH A DENT IN THE FRONT FENDER!!! 😡 Yes this place was the cheapest, but we are PAYING to keep our car safe. When told to go talk to the manager inside, the man comes out and tells my husband "that was there". WHAT THE??? He then tells my husband to "file a complaint". Which ends up being a note I wrote on the back of our reservation paper. We then had to take pictures of the car & "COMPLAINT" and email to their people. People.....spend the money for your car and your life!!<//Review>

They have only one shuttle so if the shuttle is full you will be skipped from getting picked up from the airport .

The shuttle transportation time is about 20 minutes. The shuttle bus is not that big, nor new, and it can get a little crowded. However, the staff is friendly and respectful.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>DO NOT PARK HERE! This was my 3rd and LAST time using this park this parking lot.
You will be shuttled to the airport in a dirty van, where the driver, drives like an absolute lunatic.
Everyone on the shuttle kept looking at each other throughout the drive, it was very unsafe, and children were in the car.

When it was time to be picked up from LAX I phoned them, they said “20 min.” After 25 min I phoned again, they said “10-12 min”. This went in for about an hour and a half, and I finally took a $25 cab ride to the lot, after they left me and my 7 year old son sitting at LAX for an hour and 20 min.  You’ve been warned.<//text>< Pics>

I had a car scratch during parking there May 2018, and they parked and picked the car there so the responsibility for the incident is obviously. when I talked to the staff, they told me to call manager to get the camera surveillance video to find out who did, and after talked to manager they won't give the video to individual but through insurance company.  when I claimed with my insurance Allstate, and Allstate contacted them for the video. They stated they don't give the video by mail or electrically but needs Allstate come to pick the video by person. insurance company never do that so end up you cannot do anything on them. just want to share the experience<//text>

Don’t go with this place, it is cheap yes but that’s what you will get. It’s in a bad part of town, I didn’t like leaving my car there and I don’t even have a nice vehicle. You have to leave your key there with them. While waiting for the shuttle the guy left the office and all the keys to the vehicles were not locked so I could have stolen all they keys if I wanted to. So didn’t like that anyone could come in and take keys when the guy left his office. When we returned, we waited for 32 min after calling them to send a shuttle and they called and said they never saw us! They said that the driver had just left a min ago after never seeing us. We were watching very closely and never saw a driver, plus they should have called when the arrived and asked where we were before just leaving. So I think they made that part up to make it look like our fault when really it was there fault. So they said they would send another driver but we didn’t want to wait another half hour again making it an hour total so we just got an Uber. So it didn’t end up being the cheapest after all bc we still had to pay for an Uber and we still had an unnecessary 32 minute wait. Also, they lady hung up on us when we were trying to tell her that we were watching the shuttles and never saw their shuttle come by. Terrible service.</Text>

<Review>You get what you pay for. The shuttles run about every 25 minutes in addition it takes about 30 minutes to get to and from LAX. So it'll be an hour before you get to LAX or leave LAX. Biggest issue though was that they dinged my car. Im not getting a call back and I'm going to see about filing a report. Still, its my own fault, I should've paid a little more for a better overall experience and some better customer service.</Review>< Pictures>

You get what you pay for. It's the cheapest extended parking for LA, therefore you get the cheapest service. Don't be surprised if your service is anything below mediocre. They did the job I paid them for in a timely manner, so no problems here.</Review>

Have fun...they don't really run shuttles every 10-15 minutes as they claim. Once you call, they'll quote you 20-25 minutes even when the actual driver is not working and off shift. If you're lucky, you'll get picked up after 45 minutes by a surly driver who will yell at you for getting car sick and sitting in the front seat. But, it's all part of the LAX experience. You can't have a truly miserable airport without a dishonest, pathetic long term parking company.</text>

Some of the people were nice, but the place will sell your parking spot if they are full, even if you have a reservation.  And their van only holds nine passengers, so it may take your a long, long time to get to the airport and a long, long time to get a pickup if they are busy at the time of your flight.  They finally showed up to pick us up one hour and fifteen minutes later.  It wasn't the driver's fault, but their tiny shuttle van kept filling up.< /Review>

<text>I would not recommend this business to anyone. Parking lot was in a not so good part of town. Cars are parked way to close together. I rode in an old broke down van to the airport. When it was time to get picked up I followed the directions exactly as follows on the card you receive. I waited over an hour to get picked up. After the van drove past me TWO times I called the front desk for a third time and got some lie I was at the wrong letter of the hotel shuttle pick up. After waiting and being lied to I took a $22 cab back to my car. Please do not waste your time with this company.</text>< Pics>

<review>THIEVES!!!  DO NOT TRUST!  NOT WORTH IT!

They damaged my car and refused to give their insurance information or legal contact which is illegal in CA.  Then they refused the same to my insurance company after 14 emails and over 12 phone calls.  Even before that, they were pushy, rushed, unprofessional, dangerous shuttle drivers, and overall shady operation.  The hours I spent dealing with them was not worth the few bucks I tried to save.

<review>The signs and directions to this place are so bad that I missed the entry point 3 times. The parking spots are very cramped. The only thing good about this place was the price but you pay for it by waiting the damn shuttle bus more than 45 minutes when you return. Next time, I will shell out a few more bucks and get a decent parking place.< /review>< Pictures>

i have used this lot several times. last night was the last time. will NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. my kids, and family took 2 vehicles and needed our ride back to the lot from LAX. we called, and the RUDE attendand tegar (?), told me that i was not standing at the "RED" sign, and WE ALL WERE STANDING AT A RED SIGN, i offered to take a picture and send it. he then instructed me to wait at a green sign at our arrival location and that someone would be there in 15 minutes. i told him there were six of us, and he was so rude, and hung up on me. after over an hour and 3 phone calls, we were finally picked up and taken to our cars an hour and a half later.

<Name>carla</Name><Review>Worse experience ever!!! I called when i was outside of the airport for pickup the man "Lucky" answered the phone and asked what my terminal was I said American airlines and he continued to ask me for my terminal I was like its American. This was asked like 5 times "Lucky" started screaming at me when asking me my terminal lucky then said, "you are not outside that's why you dont know your number " I said I am outside I came out of the doors of B terminal.  I asked a worker that was passing by what terminal I was at and they said 4. My thing is this is a business when you call in for pickup the works should know what airlines are in what terminals so for him to ask me like 5 times and start to screaming at me was very unprofessional and is hurting the business at the same time. Before the call ended he stated we will be there in 25 minutes.  They only have two shuttles running maybe one at times another thing that is not good. Oh and you leave your keys with them on your trip the lot is fully loaded with bummer to bummer . When arriving at the parking lot the man " lucky " was on his phone smoking. I came up to him and asked for his name so that i could write a review. I said thank you "Lucky" that's all I needed to know. He then yelled at me and said what do you want!  Mind you i was with my mother and my child there was a van full of people also and was about 9pm. He didnt care at all who heard him yelling at me. I just wonder if it was a man would he yell at them the same way he yelled at me ..... I dont think so. Yes this place is inexpensive to park at but you pay for what you get!</Review>< rating>

Cheapest place with the WORST SERVICE!! We pulled in to a lot in the early AM and it was so packed with cars bumper to bumper and on sidewalks we could hardly pull our truck in to get to the office. Online, this parking lot is listed as self park however they take your keys, park the vehicle, and keep them until you return. This was a red flag for me, why do you need access to my car if were not here to authorize? If it was a true self-park there are no need for you to keep my keys. Then the shuttle ride, we crammed into a white van with out any signage on it, the driver had his cell phone on and was texting, answering calls, and playing/watching music videos while hastily driving down back roads and alleys to get us to the airport. I was extremely uncomfortable to say the very least! Then we arrive and call the number as requested for the shuttle ride back, same driver, same van only this time we took surface streets thank goodness. We got to the office and Our truck was already in front ready for us to drive off. I walked around the truck to put my son's car seat in and notice significant damage to our truck! Someone swiped the car from the tailgate to in front of the rear tire, we were very upset! I instantly reported the damage before moving the truck anywhere, took pictures and told the parking lot attendant. He came out, took a picture and went back into the office to get a sponge and wax then attempted to claim it was paint transfer and it was no problem it would come off. Well it didn't, and the dent is still there as well! Obviously this happens very often considering they have these items on hand at 1:30am. We were told Danny the manager would be in the next morning and call us, 3 days later....Numerous calls to them...NO RESPONSE! We are submitting this to our insurance company and letting them deal with these scam artist!! We will also be filing a police report. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE HERE, I know parking for LAX is expensive but this lesson cost more than if we would have just paid a little more for a legit facility.</Text>

You will definitely have to wait over an hour and a half to be taken back to your car. Absolutely ridiculous service and they will hang up on you.. They told me to call an Uber so me and a few other people split a cab to get back to our cars. When we got there we saw 3 other families get out of cabs to get back to their cars. I never give bad ratings so listen to us and spend a little extra money because you don't want the hassle..< /Text>

Worst service ever. I took the shuttle  50 minutes to picked me up. When I called he told me only 15 minutes. My advice donyd go there, I know it's cheap but it's not worth it.</text>

These guys did a great job- got me to the airport quick and on time, picked me up 15 minutes after I called, and had my car waiting scratch-free out front when the shuttle dropped me off at the lot. I would recommend the incredible service, the prices, and the friendly and professional staff to anyone<//Text>

After landing at 10 at night I call them and was told it will be 45 mins to an hour. They said they were running late. I spent $30 dollars on a cab to the parking lot to find my car sitting in plain sight with the keys in it. I jumped in and took off. There is nobody watching whatsoever. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE GUYS!!!! Pay a little more and have peace of mind.<//Review>< pictures>

We pulled into the place and there was a vehicle backing up at the speed of light.  We honked  and it kept coming.  It finally stopped screeching about a car length in front of us.  We brought to his attention a few minutes later at check in. He said,  "I know what I am doing," laughing.  So, if you don't want your car mishandled, don't go here.

We told the man on duty when we picked up our car three weeks later. He apologized. Other than being dirty on the outside, our car was fine.<//review>

Price is fair.  Wait time and service upon return is poor.   12 min projected pickup turned into 29 minutes later.  My car was not ready and waiting.  1 minute more turned into 4 more minutes.   This should be called Mega Small or Mega Slow parking.< /Text>

Very sketchy!!! I agreed to one price on the website, all of a sudden when I arrived, my car was $15 more??? The attendant claimed my truck was considered to be a large vehicle. That was weird to me, because the website asked me for my vehicle description at the time of the reservation, so why did it quote me a different price??? Sketchy!< /Review>

If i could gave this place a negative star I would. Horrible service, I waited like 20 minutes to be taken to the airport. When I got back I waited more than 1:30 to get picked up. I called multiple times and they kept on saying they were on their way. Once they got here they didn’t had space so they made me wait another “15 minutes” which turn into 30. Do not park there!! AVOID the waiting!!< /text>

<text>They steal! My newly purchased PS4 was in my car with original box. When I got my car back, I saw the box (I was moving so have all my belongings), so I didn't bother to check. When I arrived, the box is actually empty! Can you believe it? They took your key and check your stuff, take what's valuable. I called them to complain, and the only answer is: we are not responsible for what's inside the car</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2b68eb2d098bf:0x2609648acc981133</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Then took 30 minutes once here to get our car and had to manually open the gate myself to leave. Terrible. Pick any place but here!< /review>< user_name>

<Review>Stay ayaw from this place if you have booked your parking cancel it people listen to me. I booked my car here and at first i was impressed they took us to the airport on time picked us up on time, i guess we were just lucky. But when i came back to my car my expensive cologne is missing. Luckily i have a dash cam to hear if they steal it or not. And i reviewed it at home and you can hear the driver going thru my glove compartment, opening my cologne and even sniffing it. So please if you wanna go here take all your valuable stuff take your car here as if you got it like brand new no anything inside as possible. They are cheap yes. But i would rather park on a self park where i can take my own keys. Again do not use their service its so hard to get a hold of their so called manager. Never again<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

First time I used a airport parking and it was a good experience. Make sure you keep 30+ minutes to reach to the airport from this parking. They do offer shuttle to and from LAX. I had to call from the airport and the suttle arrived in 20 minutes, my car was also ready for pick up when I reached the parking. I would definitely recommend them to my friends.<//Text>

I tried writing to management but no response. It wad very obvious my car was used for the week it was left there. They had also filled my gas tank full, but when l left it, it only had half tank.

My friends and I left our cars there for our 10 day vacation and upon our return the owner made my family and I wait 2 HOURS to be picked up, I called him a total of 8 times before he sent a van and when the driver finally arrived he was rude and drove like an idiot, the van didnt have seat belts and sounded like it was falling apart driving down the road. The lot itself is so over packed you can barley drive in and out without scrapping another vehicle.
HORRIBLE service, I will Never use them again. I will gladly pay a little extra for a credible professional service.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2b68eb2d098bf:0x2609648acc981133<//gmap_id></record>

<Name>Kevin Meador<//Name><text>Their shuttle service is the worst. They almost made us miss our flight because their single old beat up shuttle could not fit the five of us. Then on my return I waited 75 minutes in the cold to get picked up. I have used several budget parking services at LAX and this is the only time I've been disappointed.</text><gmapID>0x80c2b68eb2d098bf:0x2609648acc981133< /gmapID>< date>

I chose this place because of the Cheap Price and Self Parking.

I usually read Reviews before I patronize a business, but I made my Reservation weeks in advance before I actually did read the Reviews.

When I finally did read the Reviews I was kind of worried because even though they state it's Self Parking, it isn't.

You can park the car yourself, but you need to leave them your keys.

I don't like Valet Parking because I don't like people having access to my vehicle and its contents, but it was too late to change my reservation.

I arrived at the location at 06:30 on 01/03/17. I found a nice parking spot and proceeded to Self Park when the two Attendants waved me off and asked me if I had a Reservation and they informed me that they needed to park my vehicle.

I informed them that I did have a Reservation, and I showed them on my Smartphone that it specifically states it is a Self Parking Facility.

They informed me that I can park my vehicle, but I needed to leave them my keys. At this point in time I didn't want to start looking for a different place, so I went with it, but I did mention to them that I read some bad Reviews about this place, which they did defend themselves. They also mentioned that I can take a picture of the odometer and that I wouldn't have any problems parking here.

I removed what I felt were items that may be of value or interest to someone and gave them the keys.

They have a old white Ford E150 Passenger Van that will give you a ride to LAX.  They will give you a Numbered Parking Ticket Stub with instructions to call them when you return back from your trip and to wait under the red colored "Hotel & Courtesy Shuttle" sign.

You also need to give them the number on the Parking Ticket Stub so they can pull your car out and have it ready for you when you return.

I returned 7 days later, I called the phone number and gave them the number on my Parking Stub and the Terminal Location # and they told they would be there in 20-25 minutes.

I waited about 15 minutes and their white van with a red cardboard Mega Airplane Parking in the windshield shows up.

We picked up a few more passengers on our circle around the airport and headed back to their parking lot.

Upon arrival, my vehicle was parked with my fellow Passenger's vehicles in a row, where we could easily unload from the van and have easy access to load our luggage, and the keys were in the ignition.

Since it was evening and dark, I took out a flashlight and walked around my vehicle inspecting it for damage, (Recommended) but I found none.

I looked inside my vehicle and everything seemed in place and nothing was missing.

All in all I had a good experience, considering others had bad ones.

Would I park here again?

Probably not, because I don't like Valet Parking.

If you do park here or some other Long Term Parking, and have Holiday Presents or Valuables from shopping and plan to be away for a extended period of time (like 30 days or more, like another Reviewer posted) it would be wiser to rent a Storage Unit Place locally for a month, then to risk having your property stolen.

Just saying.< /review>

<review>I will not use Mega Airport Parking as it is ridiculously bad service. At arrival, the staff there is not friendly and at coming back to pick up us in the airport, the staff told us to wait at the airport and have waited for 10 min and I have to call back only to find out that the staff told us that there's no driver and we have to use uber to the parking lot. I have 3 small kids and we have to use bus carrying 7 big luggages and after we arrived at the lot, I see that the driver is there and the staff then told us that the shuttle broke down. This is nonsense and unacceptable and I will report to BBB as it is a flat lying. Second, I paid $10 to cover the car but they didn't do it. The staff told me it is hard or cannot do it. This is my first and last time!! very bad experience.with them!! Stay away from this company!!!</review><Rating>1</Rating>< gmap_id>

AVIOD AT ALL COSTS! The only reason Im giving them one star is because zero stars isnt an option. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars to park literally anywhere else. As soon as you walk in and pay for your spot the guy behind the counter is hasseling you for a tip. I dont have a problem with tipping but when you are aggressively asking for one every time its off putting. I come drop my car off on my way to get on an international flight and the manager says this time there is no shuttle driver and I should call an Uber. Dont advertise that you have a shuttle if you arent going to have it consistently. I didn't have time to press that cause i needed to catch my flight. On the return i call for a shuttle pick up and they guy tells me the shuttle will be there in 20 mins, I say no problem. An hour later there is no sign of any shuttle. I call back and all of a sudden there is no one picking up the phone. I call a few more times and my calls either dont get answered now  or go directly to voicemail. Little do they know I have a seperate line for work and call them on that one and guess what, that call gets answered. The guys says he is on his way. This is almost 1.5 hours after he said he would be there in 20 minutes. When he shows up the shuttle is packed and we cant get in, we tell the driver we have been waiting and all he has to say is that its not his problem. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!< /review>

People behind the desk were not helpful or friendly.  Made me feel like they were doing me a favor by talking to me.  Waited over 15 minutes for pickup on arrival at LAX.  Would not use Mega again.</Review>

<review>Abusive and careless. Terrible service. Front desk woman will just yell at us for not reading her mind. Some dude that picks up the phone provides false information about prices and availability and nobody knows who he is. We had to wait one hour for the shuttle to pick us up and endure their terrible manners and incompetence every time we phoned asking where the hell was the van to pick us up. AVOID.<//review>< Pics>

I think ot is almost the cheapest parking you can find around LAX! Actually it service was not that bad and I got my car back without any problems or damages. It is not a self parking and they take your keys, but the best part is that when you take off from the shuttle, your car is ready there. If you want a parking with minimum budget, probably this is the best you can get. (I paid 5 dollar per day for a suv, no suv or service fee like other parkings)<//text>

<Review>There the cheapest in town, but don’t let park your car and keep your keys. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR CAR FOR DAMAGE BEFORE YOU LRAVE LOT. I forgot to check. Next day I see a big scrape/ dent on number.  I called them they said they can’t do nothing about it.  Better yet make a video of your car in front of him pointing out all damage. Ricardo Granados.  And no I won’t be parking my car there are parking at Walleys part better it’s only two dollars more aday.  And I pick you have Pastor the trucks go to the hotel shuttles every five minutes .

<user_name>Robert Claudio< /user_name><time>1403711540270< /time><rate>1</rate><review>I will be posting this on any possible review site my experience from drop off to pick up of my car. I arrived on a Sunday morning around 7am to only find an empty parking lot with cars crammed in every corner and not one person to be found. I had to go looking for the guy in a office that was closed and the lights were out inside. I finally got my car parking paid for and was taken to the airport. It's about 15-20 mins away from LAX, so take that into consideration when you plan to arrive. The drop off of my car wasn't as bad as when I arrived back from my trip. I called as requested per a card that the guy hands you, to only be met with a guy in a small van and already have three people in a 10 passenger bus including the driver. We continued to two other stops to only arrive at the third stop and find a family of 4, and a couple waiting to board. At that time we only had 3 seats available, and yet the driver crammed everyone into the van making people sit on laps. Making it a very uncomfortable, and illegal drive back to the parking lot. We finally arrived at the parking lot to only find the guy in the office to not have any of his paperwork updated, and giving every customer attitude cause he couldn't find there name on a list of paper. The process took forever, and his attitude towards the customer was disgusting. He kept telling people to move aside and ask for the other person in line when not even resolving that persons problem in locating there car. Finally I got the keys to my car and wasn't offered to bring it up for easy access and loading of my luggage. Instead I am just pointed towards the direction of my car. I locate my car and leave since I couldn't deal with this and it was already 1am on a Monday morning. I see the following morning that the rear of my bumper is damaged due to the way they back cars on top of cars in this parking lot. I had scratches and licenses plate indents in my car. So it's obvious that they just back the cars into each other with no regard or care for the persons property. I called them to make them aware to only be told that he wasn't going to do anything and that I needed to call it out to him while I was on the lot.

Overall I highly do NOT recommend this place. I tried to save money by finding the cheapest place and now ended up regretting and getting what I paid for with a bad experience that will forever mess with my incredible vacation. And the damage to my car that I am now going to have to pay out of my pocket to repair. So I would recommend if you could to just find another parking lot that you may have to pay a little more, but your car will be in much better hands than it would he here.

We had a great experience dropping off our vehicle.  The dropping off process was seamless.  However, I would give this company zero stars based on the picking up process.  First off, I called Mega Airport at 10:01pm as spoke to a friendly gentleman.  I told him that we needed to be picked up from Allegiant Airlines baggage claim but he stated that I needed to know the terminal.  He said it was terminal 3 but I needed to verify.  So, I walked downstairs to the baggage claim and walked outside of the terminal.  I looked up and saw terminal 3, so I called Mega Airport again at 10:12pm.  This time I spoke to a lady.  I told her that we needed a ride from terminal 3 and she said that she will send a van to pick us up.  She also asked me if we had valet or self-park and I advised her that we had valet parking.  We waited for 26 minutes, then my husband called back to get the status of the pickup.  He spoke to the same lady that I spoke to but she was very unprofessional and rude.  She lied to my husband and told him that I never spoke to her.  She said that I spoke to a guy and told him terminal 1.  She also told my husband that he better not write a bad review about her.  He spent 5 minutes on the phone with this lady.  The shuttle came about 10-15 minutes later.  We were sitting under the green sign for shuttles and other pickup vehicles.  The shuttle stopped prior to where we were sitting and at first the driver (which was the manager) refused to drive down to where we were sitting which was approximately 25 feet.  After motioning for several seconds for her to drive down, she finally decided to drive down.  My mother in law has difficulty walking and standing and walks with a cane.  On top of her lack of mobility, we were traveling in a group of 6 with luggage and found it very unprofessional for the driver to refuse to drive the 25 feet, even after we had been waiting approximately 45 minutes for a ride.  When the driver (the manager) got out of the van, she slammed her door and rudely walked to the back of the van to open the doors.  We were expressing to her our frustration with the lady on the phone.  However, instead of apologizing for the confusion and providing exceptional customer service, as the manager, she began stating that she was the manager and if she was told terminal 3, then she would've been at terminal 3.  I couldn't believe how the driver (manager) didn't show any empathy towards us.  She kept slamming the doors.  She got on the phone while driving and started discussing the incident on the phone.  Once again, displaying the nonprofessional and lack of tact of this company.  We arrived at Mega Airport and she didn't even speak to our party.  To make matters worst, she thanked the other group that rode the van and told them to have a good night!  While continuing to ignore and being rude to my group.  I feel like we were treated in a discriminatory nature.  We deserved much better treatment than we received from Mega Airport.  We hope that this review will spark customer service training for the employees and also make you think twice about parking your vehicle at Mega Airport, unless you want to be discriminated against and mistreated.< /Review>

DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CAR HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO RETURN TO A CAR WITH A $450 DAMAGE! We left our car during a week-long  trip and when we  picked it up the front bumper was damaged. The person in charge, Tee, immediately said they were not responsible, she said the damage was already there and reluctantly allowed us to file an incident report. She said they would review their surveillance tape and we would get a call in 14 days which we never did. We called them numerous times trying to get a resolution and to speak with the manager but he refused to take our calls and of course our car is still damaged.
Please do not support horrible businesses like these who just take your money, damage your car, do not accept any responsibility whatsoever and treat you with no respect at all. Share this with your friends and family!</text>

Horrible experience. While my vehicle was parked at there (28 Mar-06 Apr 2015) it was damaged. My vehicle had been valet parked and when I picked it up they tried to pretend that they didn't notice the damage. This was strange because the same associate that initially inspected my car when I dropped it off was the same person to bring it back up to the office when I picked it up. I have been getting the run-around for the past two months from one of their managers who keeps assuring me that the issue will be resolved. So far, no luck and I'm stuck with a $1400 repair bill. I don't recommend this parking lot to anyone. If you like the current state of your vehicle, stay away from Mega Airport Parking!<//text>

They say they run a shuttle every 15 minutes? Yeah right. More like every 45. And when I try to call and complain, or to request the status of the shuttle, it usually goes to voicemail. Cannot stress enough: STEER CLEAR</Review>

IF YOU ARE PRESSED FOR THE TIME, DO NOT PARK HERE.  Shuttle (old minivan) runs whenever they fill their shuttle "NOT EVERY 10-15 MINUTES" since shuttle drivers has to pay for the gas!!!!!!!  One hour wait is very usual thing here.</Review>

Waited for 50 Minutes for the shuttle to pick us up at the airport after a 6 hour flight.  They may be cheap but the service is HORRIBLE.  The drive said he was stuck in traffic but we saw every other company at least 5 or 6 times.  We knew they were the same vans because the drivers were the same.  Somehow no other company was "stuck in traffic"
The driver then made terrible remarks about us to another passenger in Spanish.  Guess what?  We speak Spanish and understood everything he was saying.  What an awful experience.  NEVER again!</Text>

Got home and noticed damage to the front of the car. Not surprised looking at the way they park the cars. Also noticed the passenger seat was adjusted, probably someone hanging out in the car. Not going to try to pursue with them, one of the drivers told me no one lasts there, the owner pays minimum and makes the shuttle drivers pay for their own gas. If you pay with a CC you can opt to give the drivers a tip, but I doubt they ever see it.

Cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for. Word to the wise, inspect your car when you pick it up.<//text>

I travel frequently and was trying out Mega for the first time because the cheaper rate. I had to wait almost 40 mins for a shuttle which led to me missing my flight to Hawaii. I already checked in online, but baggage terminal was closed (30 mins prior to take off). I had to wait for 3 weeks to hear back from the manager at Mega that Mega will not compensate for my loss even though it was Mega's fault, for the 40 minutes wait, plus 20 minutes to get to the terminal. The manager's name is Mann, he is nice and has dealt with me professionally, but nice is not going to cut it when your parking service cannot live up to the promise it has per its advertisement. Mega's advertisement stated that it has shuttle service to LAX every 10 to 15 minutes. But Mega does not have enough shuttles to get its customers to the airport. I strongly advice everyone NOT to use this airport parking.</review>< pictures>

OMGosh...DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CAR HERE!!!...I repeat...DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CAR HERE!!!

I had no problem finding the place although it is cramped with too many cars in the lot...The inside service area smelled very bad and reaked of body odor from the employee...yuck!!!...The shuttle ride to the airport was immediate...No problems there.

My car was parked there for 4 days...On the return, we waited for about 30 minutes to be picked up...no big deal...

Here's where I had the problem...My car was already waiting for me at the front when we arrived but guess what...it was PACKED with ants!!!... I mean packed inside and outside!!!...they were in the front all over the passenger seat and the console are...they were also in the back speak crawling everywhere!!!...They were also all over the outside bumper...My car must have been parked near or under a tree because there was also flower petals all over the trunk area...It was already around 9 pm so I couldn't see very well but my car is white and you could see the ants crawling all over my car clearly...I asked for the manger and he wasn't there...

I asked  Daveed if he had some cleaner, wipes or spray to try to clean out my car...He had nothing...I asked for paper towels...He had nothing...I said can u get some from the bathroom...He said there was none in the bathroom and the toilet was stopped up...He then went and returned with a vacuum cleaner for me to use to clean out my OWN car...He said he was busy and he didn't have time to assist me..What!!!

That's when I LOST it!!!...i told him I was reporting this place to BBB and this would not be the last time they hear from me!!!...He then told me to wait and he would vacuum for me...He did but that did not eliminate all the ants....After driving home for 30 minutes, a lot of the ants resurfaced...It took me an additional hour to wipe down and clean parts of the car...Even today, there are still some ants INSIDE the car...This pisses me off...I'm gonna have to take my car to the carwash for a full detail.

I demanded a refund...I was only given the portion I paid at the lot...The amount I paid online to hold the reservation was not refunded....I tried to call the owner Daveed on Monday...I left my number and I have not received a return call.

THis is unacceptable customer service...I figured I would go with this parking lot because my car was older and the price was cheap...I guess you get what you pay for...I would advise anyone thinking of leaving their car here to try another place...Bad customer service and not clean...

I would NEVER park my car here again!!!...2 days later and I am still waiting to hear from the owner Manni.</review>

Bad customer service,, i arrive at 400 am for  my 630am flight and tookme 10 min to wake up the attendant she was sleeping on the sofa and when she finally woke up she was in a bad mood and sloooooow i finally got to the terminal at 545am Almost lost my flight.

When i came back from my trip i call for the pick up i told the guy terminal 6 and 20 min later i saw the shuttle going by, when she finnaly pick me up she told me the guy in the office told her terminal 5..... when i arrive to the lot i recibe my car with a scratch on driver side.
The attendant didnt now what to do so he called the manager and they said he is going to contact me the next day, this happens a week ago still no response from the. Another customer notice a big scratch on the back bumper of hes car at the same time i pick up my car...

Only good thing was the price and the girls from the shuttle they give really good sevice except for the shuttle van has no a/c..

Just be aware of this place...
I dont recommend this place and i rather pay more next time for a self parkin service..< /Text>

Beware of this Airport Parking service provider.  If an issue arises, and more than normal communication with them is needed, there is a chance you will be treated poorly.  Instead of politely, fairly and professionally.

They ripped my luggage and two of the three people I spoke with were very impolite and treated me badly.  They were rude, one yelled at me, they became visibly irritated, and they treated me like an adversary.  After several fruitless phone calls and neglected emails, I was not able to speak to anybody in charge to lodge a complaint or to reach a resolution for my damaged luggage.

It took 90 minutes to get picked up at the airport.

The driver was extremely irritated that we were standing under the wrong sign (purple instead of red).

•	He complained to us about people like us
•	He scolded us all the way to the parking lot
•	He took out one of their instruction cards and said, “Look at this! Does this say to stand under the purple sign?  NO!  It says to stand under the red sign!”
•	He used a few bad words under his breath loud enough for us to hear while he was complaining

When we arrived at the parking lot, the driver accidentally ripped my bag when pulling it out of the van.  The bag snagged on a metal shard in a small uncarpeted area on the floor of the van as he was pulling it out.

We went into the office and the driver asked me to write down my information so the manager could contact me.

•	I started doing it; then he said he wanted keep the bag.
•	I asked how I was expected to get my clothes home.
•	He said I could go back another day to drop off the bag.  The problem with that was I do not live nearby.  I continued writing down my information, hoping I could work something out with the manager the next day

•	He asked me if I had a receipt for the bag.  He asked in a way that implied that if I did not have the receipt, they were not going to pay for it.
•	I showed him the receipt on my phone
•	He raised his voice and said it was a cheap bag

•	He said this was such a small thing, implying that my damaged bag was not important and he had better things to do
•	He was finding excuses and complaining about everything

•	We asked for his supervisor’s contact information and he scoffed and said he didn’t have one because he was the owner

My traveling companions suggested that we could fix the entire situation if the driver just gave me 20 dollars in cash hoping I could go home with my bag and not have to worry about it anymore.

•	The driver agreed and gave me the cash.
•	But then he became irritated and started talking under his breath, and abruptly said he still wanted to keep my bag.
•	I asked how I was going to carry my things home.
•	He raised his voice and said, “Well I'm not going to pay for your bag and also let you keep your bag!”
•	The driver was yelling, and was agitated the entire time.
•	I gave him his money back and left the place of business extremely frustrated

After my experience, I called the manager of the parking lot three times at hours I was told he would be there.  Each time I called, he was not available.  On the third call I asked if I could leave my number, but the girl who answered said I could not because she was too busy.  Then she hung up on me.

I emailed the business in four different ways; via an email, via a messaging page on their website, via a survey they sent to me, and the reservation company that referred me to them sent them an email on my behalf.  They did not respond.

I will never park here again.  The substandard dealings I had with these people has left me certain that paying more to park my car has a higher value in emotional comfort than to save a few dollars and risk being treated so poorly.  To be fair, one of the three people I dealt with was helpful and kind, but the management of a business must surely be aware of the type of service the majority of their employees are providing.<//text>

It’s the cheapest extended parking for Los Angeles, therefore you get the cheapest service. Don’t be surprised if your service is below average.<//review>

Drive to the airport was a bit unsafe and took an unusual/unnecessary route for it being 5am, no traffic - wait was 15 min.  Drive back ok - About a 30min wait. They got the job done!< /Review>

Poorly lit location. Only one desk person. If I knew I had time to find another lot without missing my plane I would have gone. Parking distance between vehicles is too narrow. Shuttle was 20 minutes, not the advertised 10-15.<//text>

Scammers.   They charged me an extra day with some fast talking scam and crossing out my return day and writing the following day.  All just to make $7 extra dollars.   When I called to get my money back, he argued with me for 5 minutes.   He skipped numbers while counting the number of days</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is very unfortunate that there are businesses that offer one thing and for the reason that you paid in advance they do not comply with you. We had the worst experience with this business, the Indian who greeted us did not even offer an apology, even worse tried to blame us that we were in the wrong area. When we hired the service leaving our car, er to take us and pick us up at the airport when we returned from our trip, we came from Vienna with a 9-hour difference, on a 17-hour flight and we still had to drive from Los Angeles to the Center California, approximately 4 hours, taking into account that there is no traffic, we wait 2 hours at the airport right in the same place where the driver who left us at the beginning clearly told us that he would pick us up right there, because it seems that Mr. rested and only was the Hindu because he lacked personnel, he never came arguing that they did not find us but they were lies because after an hour they finally arrived to arrive in 10 minutes, saying that they had already located us, we waited 40 more minutes and they did not arrive, we had to go in a taxi to pick up our car, pay a separate taxi when we had already paid for the service with it, it is outrageous that they go above the needs of the client and they want to make you believe that you are the wrong one, they do not take into account that you come tired and that you still have to drive 4 more hours, it is incredible and reprehensible that there are people so irresponsible and disrespectful, surely you only thought about making more sales and instead of closing and moving for us, or at least he would have told us the truth from the beginning that he would not arrive we would not have lost 2 hours waiting, we would have understood, and if he had lost us to take a taxi, but that he did not try to justify himself saying they didn't find us When we were already desperate in a taxi that arrived and did us the favor of taking us to the place that we had hired to pick up our car, the call returned, because he no longer answered us, then my husband told him that we were already in a taxi to There, it was at that moment that he said he was coming for us, as we were gone, it could have been a lie. You can't believe such a person

Es muy lamentable  que existan negocios que ofrecen una cosa y por la razón de que pagaste por adelantado no te cumplan.  Tuvimos la peor experiencia con este negocio, el  hindú que nos atendió ni siquiera ofreció una disculpa, peor aún trató de culparnos a nosotros que estábamos en el área equivocada. Cuando contratamos el servicio dejando nuestro automóvil, er para que nos llevara y recogiera al aeropuerto al regreso de nuestro viaje, veníamos de Vienna con un horario de 9 horas de diferencia, en un vuelo  de 17 horas  y todavía debíamos manejar de Los Ángeles al Centro California, aproximadamente 4 horas, tomando en cuenta que no haya tráfico, esperamos 2 horas en el aeropuerto justamente en el mismo lugar donde el chofer que nos dejó al inicio claramente nos dijo que  ahí mismo nos  recogería, pues parece que el señor descansó y sólo estaba el hindú por que le faltaba personal, nunca llegó argumentando que no nos encontraban pero eran mentiras por que después de una hora finalmente quedaron de llegar en 10 minutos, diciendo que ya  nos habían ubicado, esperamos 40 minutos más y no llegaron, tuvimos que irnos en un taxi a recoger nuestro carro, pagar aparte taxi cuando ya teníamos pagado el servicio con éste, es indignante que pasen por encima de las necesidades del cliente y te quieran  hacer  creer que tu eres el equivocado, no  toman en cuenta que vienes cansado y  que aún debes manejar 4 horas más, es increíble y reprobable que existan personas tan irresponsables e irrespetuosas, con toda seguridad sólo pensó en hacer más ventas y en vez de cerrar y trasladarse por nosotros, o por lo menos nos hubiera dicho la verdad desde un principio  que no  llegaría no hubiéramos perdido  2 horas esperando, nosotros hubiéramos comprendido, y  si nos hubiera perdido  tomar un  taxi, pero que no  intente justificarse diciendo que no nos encontraban. Cuando ya íbamos desesperados en un taxi que llegó y  nos hizo el favor de llevarnos al lugar que habíamos contratado para recoger  nuestro automóvil, nos regresó  la llamada, por que ya no nos contestaba, entonces  mi esposo le dijo que ya íbamos en un taxi  para allá,  fue en ese momento que  dijo que  iba llegando por nosotros, como ya no estábamos, pudo haber sido mentira. No puedes creer en una persona así<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>I usually take care of our cars but this time my wife was trying to get oil changed at this place. My vife questioned the price because it sounded little higher than normal and they just exploded. They told my wife that we are the professionals not you. Extremely disappointed and would never use their services again!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>They were fast. Charged me 42.99. I paid $50 cash. They owed me 7.01 change. They handed me a couple of bills, no penny. When I got home, saw they gave me $2.00. Shorted me $5.01. I'll never go there again.<//Text><Name>AnneMurphy Luevanos</Name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Honestly they were cool for a minute. Fast, reliable, I took a bunch of my cars there with no problems. But one of my cars I took once that takes Full Synthetic Oil, they asked me if I wanted to do a complete flush so I went ahead with it. I don’t know what they did but a week later the whole engine started having problems and blew up.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Its is very difficult to communicate with them, as English in not their first language. Secondly, they do not give receipts, and lastly they over-tighten the bolt on the oil drain pan (a $600 repair).</text>

Fast oil change while you wait in your vehicle. But good luck trying to establish a clear dialog with the attendant!</review>

Close on Sunday, very inconvenience, otherwise they are ok for the price and speed! You dont even need to step out your car at all. You have options to go with regular oil or synthetic, all authentic off-the-shelf retail packaged, ranging from 40 to 80, which is decent. They will also check and refill your water, tire and whatnot. Not sure why the other guy complain 75 for an oil change and being racist about these folks. A dealer can charge upwards 100 or go with other 30 for genetic bulk oil.< /Review>

Don't come here for an oil change. They will take advantage of you. 75 dollars for an oil change they said to me. Hey man, learn to speak English before doing business in America.< /Text>

Excellent & authentic Ethiopian food & good prices too.  Large portions gave us good amount of leftovers to enjoy later at home.  Definitely will go back in the future.</Review>

I heard great things about this place and felt that I needed to make the drive from OC to give it a shot and man it was well worth the trip. The food is absolutely incredible and the people were so friendly. They gave me so much quantity and everything was homemade. Ethiopian food is probably my favorite type of food to eat and I am looking forward to coming back again in the future.</Text>

I just have to say I love this place! It was the first restaurant I ever took my daughter when she was just a few months old. The family who runs GS have been nothing but sweet and generous and amazing in every way. I love the food, I love the authenticity, and I recommend this place to anyone who knows me. I will probably head on over after this post to have some more of their food!<//Text>

<text>Definitely worth it to go! Easier to go to and get to then driving all the way to Little Ethiopia in downtown LA. The food was incredible and a great price. I split a dish and a couple additions with 6 people and it was very cheap and reasonable once split. They have all sorts of Ethiopian food and beverages available and the coffee ceremony is there. They had Ethiopian music in the background. Absolutely recommend going. The food is incredible and a great price.</text>< pics>

SO good! This restaurant made me fall in love with Ethiopian food. We have been coming for over a year now. Always fresh and delicious. We get the veggie platter or beef and veggie platter. One platter is more than enough for 2 people. You will receive at least 7 different types of veggie or lentil based stews to go with the injera. I think the variety is incredible, and the spices used with the beef and lentils are so delicious. We usually get two platters so we can have tons of leftovers.

I recommend this place to anyone who will listen! And we drive well out of our way to come here, it is always worth it! I hope they stay in business for many decades to come. Orders are ready quickly and they are always so kind.<//Review>

, love this place. The service is great, the food is amazing.  We come several times a month because we just enjoy the warmth and delicious food.

Tried this not expecting to love it as much as we do now and we are so incredibly happy we did. The portions are great, the cost very reasonable and the drive if your not local is worth it.</text><date>1583640298956</date>< username>

Best ethiopian food I've had so far. Generous servings of injera. The veggie combo comes with every veggie option on the menu so you get to sample everything! The flavors were so fresh and well developed. I've never tried ethiopian style beets and they were seriously delicious. They make their own honey wine. I was curious about it and since I've never tried ethiopian style honey wine, they let me try a sample. It's more funky than mead but in an awesome way! I ended up buying a bottle. It's a 45 minute drive to get here but I'm already planning out when I can come back!! The owners are very friendly and were happy to answer questions I had about regional ethiopian food<//Review>

Excellent staff, and the food is great.  The veggie platter has more variety than other places I've been and it is A LOT closer than Fairfax in LA.  The veggie platter is a full meal for two.  I took another one to go and reheated it in a skillet with some scrambled eggs, which can feed up to 4.< /text>

Food seasoned well, however, do ask questions if you see something in your dish not mentioned in the menu. I tasted jalapenos in my dish not stated in the menu and I do not eat these, too spicy for me, so I needed to pick these out. Also a salad was to be served, but I was not told prior that they  were out and I ordered a side when I could have substituted for the salad. The side was an additional amount. It was quite crowded but served by what seemed to be three people and this was on a Sunday. Not a large establishment but ample parking.<//text>

The food was absolutely incredible. The flavors are amazing. I got the beef and veggie platter, and my husband got the veggie platter. It's so healthy with all the vegetables. They kindly took our pick up order 20 minutes before closing. We were traveling and got in to town late. So glad they could accommodate us. The staff/owners were friendly and kind when we picked up our order. We can't wait to come back and eat inside the restaurant.</Review>

<text>The service was great. Each dish had its own individual flavor. The lentils, and the two yellow split pea sides were delicious. I also enjoyed the aromatic Spiced tea which is similar to Masala tea. It's a blend of Black tea, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon.< /text>< rate>

<Text>In this case "GS" stands for "good stuff"! We've been to Ethiopian restaurants all throughout Southern California including San Diego and Los Angeles, and this restaurant is on par with the best of them! The interior was clean and cultural and our waitress was very kind. We ordered the beef and vegetable platter, which was enough to feed our two hungry, growing boys and their parents. The platter included meat which was tender and delicious, and a variety of vegetables which were very tasty. We were also ordered their special coffee and were treated to a coffee ceremony that included the burning of frankincense, as per traditional Ethiopian custom. The prices here are great, even compared with other Ethiopian restaurants in the area! There's also a cute little gift shop. The only complaint is that this place is a little bit hard to find. It is located right next to a Subway, but we almost missed it. Definitely coming back here again!</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c32903cbf9b8cd:0xa28e0098d3829003</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great place to eat. Prices are fair for the amount of food they give. Food is full flavor and they really know how to make vegetables taste good. This is a family owned business and is the mom of the 2 daughters the does the cooking. so if you you want authentic ethiopian cuisine this is the place. Also the the daughters are super sweet n welcoming. Love coming to this place. I am a regular here. i wish them success in their business. they got my support<//review>

I generally drive to Little Ethiopia on Fairfax to get my monthly fix of Ethiopian food. This location is a little bit closer to my home so I decided to try it. The food is really good and I have been back twice. The portions are good and are compatible to the price. The owners are super friendly and on my second visit I was treated to a round of Ethiopian coffee which was really nice of them. I definitely will be stopping by again. I highly recommend this restaurant<//text>

I'm SO glad I stumbled upon this place. I've been driving out to Little Ethiopia to get my fix but now I have a place much closer to home. I can confidently say that the food here is better than the food you'll find out in Little Ethiopia. The family that owns the place is wonderful. The mom cooks all the food in the back while the daughter and dad run the front of house. It's so good that I go anytime I'm visiting home from Dallas!< /review>

I have been to a few Ethiopian restaurants and none of them had been as authentic and fresh as this place. The service here is great super friendly! I ordered a full plate along with the sampler for my mom. This place is also great because the food is as I said fresh and you can tell it is authentically homemade Ethiopian food. I also love how healthy the food is because it is so hard to find a healthy and satisfying dish these days.

<review>Being part of ZGC Innovation Center has been an incredible experience for our company. We are a very early stage startup based in San Jose. The team over at ZGC has tremendously helped our business grow as well as provided us with the right guidance to help us reach our goals. The workspace is very clean, very well organized, and everyone is respectful. There are numerous other startups here also are doing really amazing things and disrupting their respective industries. We are very happy and grateful to be part of ZGC Innovation Center and highly recommend it to anyone in Silicon Valley.< /review><gmap_id>0x808fc9c462dfbb3d:0xe5015039d9c729b1<//gmap_id><user_id>102148866178708746040</user_id>< time>

Went there for a meetup; nice venue, good seating, and usually meet-up meal (Pizza and soda/water.) Staff was pretty friendly -- except one person asked for my business card and didn't ask others (that made me feel a little strange, like they didn't expect me to be there or something.) Oh well.< /Review>

<text>The entire experience was great.. Try the chicken sandwich please (they just joined the chicken sandwich race and I know who I am rooting for) when you have the owners attending and recommending food and drinks, you know you found a gem. Since it was a HOTTEST🔥 day.. The cold beer quenched everyone. Love you guys.. All 7 of you who helped me get through a fantastic meal.</text>< user_name>

<Review>Great food,large portions and great service.

I had their spaghetti dinner it came with a huge salad. These dinners can easily be shared. Looks like I'll have leftovers tomorrow.
Wife had the lasagna with a blush sauce.
Server was very attentive to my drink going dry.  Never pushy, nerve rushed. Just great attention to the customer.</Review>< pics>

<Text>I adore this restaurant! They provide tasty meals, they have a nice menu, The chief cook in that restaurant is a specialist, I love a lot trying all their food. The food is always of high class, the attitude towards the visitors  is efficient. I visit often this restaurant and I was never unsatisfied.  I highly recommend it.</Text>< GmapID>

I saw all these great reviews on Nextdoor Neighbor and decided to order a bunch of different things so we'd be able to try everything.  We had 8 people eating and not one of us was impressed with the food.   A huge amount of money and a waste.  They forgot one of our dishes and when we called, they wouldn't credit my account.  They offered a store credit which was not helpful.  I didn't like it the first time so why would I buy again!< /Text>

This is surely one of the most attractive place in the area. Every time I visit this place I am greatly pleased. They hold their very high  standard service and the highest level of dishes  they serve. You are always happy with this place. Very  recommended.</review>

The antipasto salad was so small & missing half the ingredients!! $30.00 on nothing. The pizza is not the same as it used to be . We will not be ordering eccos anymore.I've ordered there since I was a kid. So disappointing.<//Text>

I live in Ventura County for the last 15 years but visit LB about once a month and Eccos is a must whenever I'm in town.  There's simply nothing like it! The best pizza on the planet! The cheese is real and super thick, delicious sauce and they hide all the yummy toppings under that cheese.

I am sorry to say that this place has gone downhill.  I have bought pizza from Ecco's since 1980?s.  We always enjoyed the pizza until this past year It seems the sauce has changed and the pizza is very grease.  At times our pizza hasn't been made correctly and when we complain the staff ignores us.  The woman who answers the phone to take you order has been very rude too.  We have quit eating at this place because there are many other pizza places that will listen when our orders are wrong and treat us with respect.< /text>

I have been going to Eccos for over 30 years now. Started as a fun memory with my mom and the food was good. I moved away for 14 years,  recently came back and was driving by and just had to go back. It was everything I remembered and more. The food is still excellent, like heaven in my mouth good. The staff is friendly. The decor is pretty much the same and I love it. Now that I am back in town I will def be coming here more.<//Review>

<Review>I have been going to Ecco's since i was little. Pizza and service was always fabulous and u needed a knife and fork to eat it. Now pizza is thin and floppy with toppings and cheese sliding off pizza. New owners???? I just ordered a large 3 topping pizza for $27. I asked for thick crust and was told she would try...said people complained about under cooked pizza??? Never coming here again. Sad after 40 years and no offer of refund. Zero customer service!!!</Review>< pics>

Food was good but the place needs updating. Worst thing was that they have 4 wifi access points visible but they won't share the access code!!!!!!!! The location is in some sort of cellular black hole so phones wouldn't work.
Look, I get that we should spend more meaningful family time during dinner but that should be my decision. Some people need to work or communicate with the outside world.<//text>

The pizza was so delicious. Best pizza I have ever had in a long time. The crust was crispy but not to much it was perfect. I also order a side salad for two. Our waiterss was on top of it. I would like to say thank you to Sam. She was so nice and attentive. The place was nice and clean. I will be coming back soon.< /review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd31bac9b9695b:0x511b35a5e78dbe0</Gmap_id><review>Cozy place. Booths and tables are available. Plenty of seating. There is a front counter for to-go and pick-up orders.

They offer pizza, sandwiches, chicken plates, and appetizers. Wine and domestic and imported beers.

The food is good. Typically get the small pizza along with the toasted ravioli. Very tasty. Fried chicken is good as well as the meatball sub.

Prices lean towards the more expensive side. It's rare to get out of there with a sub $50 bill for two people.

We plan on returning many more times.</review></record></dataset><record>

I've been here when it's been busy and when it's been empty a few times. Overall I've enjoyed each visit. Staff is very friendly and very attentive, I really appreciate that. The pizza is very good. Made from scratch the marinara is delicious so is the mozzarella cheese. They have week day specials. On Monday's you can buy a big slice of pepperoni or cheese pizza for $2. I ordered two slices and could just finish one. I was very stuffed from their cheesy garlic bread. Also on Thursday's kids eat free!< /Text>

<Review>I LOVE this place. First time coming here today thanks to my best friend Liz, and we had the best pizza ever. Their cheese and sauce and fresg dough. Amazing. Hands down. Their wing sauce was bomb too. Our waiter was really attentive and nice with my food modifications. I will definitely be coming back real soon! Can't get enough of how great this place was. Thank you for the experience.</Review>< pics>

I've been coming here since they opened over 35 years ago.  Many will say the place has changed too drastically away from its roots.  I have to say I agree.  I believe the pizza is back to being a premium product.  This pizza shares all the good from the original recipe but now the crust is a thick airy artisan Chicago style.  I truly have tried the top 3 Chicago pizza restaurants and can say this is as close to Chicago you'll get in Long Beach.  Give them a retry!!< /text>

< Review>
My boyfriend and I both agree that this place has the best pizza we have ever had. I lived in NY for 8 years so I think I know if a pizza is good. The sauce is really flavorful and rich and there is a lot of cheese and the cheese tastes amazing! I've had too much pizza where  the cheese tastes like nothing and this place does not use that kind of cheap tasting  cheese. The crust is also so delicious, it makes you wanna eat the crust edges. I really like the feel of the restaurant, it feels Italian in there. They also have a big menu with many options besides pizza. The broasted chicken is really good, and the minestrone soup is amazing with fresh veggies and tasted so home made!
It's not a very cheap menu but it's so worth it because of the quality and the amount you get. We got a medium pizza and it lasted us 2 days eventhough my bf is a big eater.</Review>

Great family restaurant with savory fare.  There's a diverse menu with a lot of items to choose.  Pasta is decent, pizza is better and even some good dessert (cannoli!).  The atmosphere is casual and the restaurant is quite large - convenient for groups. Takeout is a cinch.  The frequent diner program is a nice perk to encourage repeat business and there's discounts for college students; also lunch deals.< /review>

This review is based on the green city market stand. I come to the market pretty much every Saturday just to get my favorite horizon and Ecco's Pizza Restaurant. I'm the biggest fan and think I have told all of Long Beach, CA about it.
The breakfast taco is the most amazing, and unique, that I have  ever had. All fresh, market ingredients. Made right in front of you, what more can you ask for.
Oh and the staff is super friendly and helpful. I recently met the owner Brad. He is so friendly and fun. Seems like a great person to work for. Now if only i could get him to offer the tacos during the winter when they move into the nature museum. Lol can't wait till Saturday.</review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>Casual dining atmosphere at fancy restaurant prices. Pasta was not bad, just very expensive. Pizza is reasonable and the place is definitely a pizzeria setting. Very basic pasta options available. Vegi and gluten free dishes also available, but much more expensive than regular counterparts. Family friendly atmosphere and very nice staff. Sorry, no arcade, though. Overall, an average pizzeria.</Text><rate>3< /rate>< user_name>

We had the three grandkids and were looking for pizza with TV.  Ecco Pizza over-delivered on all categories of food and service.  Our server Sam was patient with the kids (and adults).  Food was great and very good value.  We will be back to Ecco when we visit Long Beach!  A fantastic evening overall.< /text>

Service was good.  They messed up our order,  then just threw what they forgot on top.  Too much cheese for my liking, but they may have put on extra to try to hide their mistake<//Review>

We waited over an hour to be seated and they were only moderately busy, very unprofessional and disorganized.  Then another 2 hours to get our order taken and get our food. I strongly suggest never coming here. Go down the road to marris pizza, better food and you actually get seated and cared for unlike at eccho's!<//review>< Pics>

<text>I was moving into my new house last friday and didn't want to cook. So I looked up nearby pizza locations and found Ecco's. I ordered 2 large pizza (peperoni and olive, and Hawaiian) and my total including delivery was $47 (not including tip). Long story short, I don't think I will be ordering from them again.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

If I could do no stars I would. Listed to close at 10. Doors were locked at 7:30 on a Saturday night. When I knocked to enter to meet my party I asked what time do you guys close? The worst manager i have ever met who ignored me (my family came to the door after calling them on theor cells) replies 8 tonight but were not taking anyone else (you mean guests, and weird if you close at 8 dont you take your last customer at 8? What do I lnow I've only been a restaurant manger and hotel food and beverage manager and worked in the industry for my entire career) . I met my party inside the party of 10 behind me were turned away. The lights were SHUT OFF on our party of 4 with a baby at 8:45 along with our pizza and beer still on our table. As a food and beverage manager I cannot even believe the actions that took place heck theor own staff couldnt... Our server apologized a million times and the cook begged us t complain sayong the manager does t all the time (heck it does take money from them) I never bad mouth, however the manager was horrible. The worst, I would have fired her. Our waiter wonderful. All I can say i understand labor and the cost of running a buisness. Its my job! However if is buisness is slow absolutely cut staff early but leave one server and one cook on and stay open the hours you say you are. Run your buisness correctly. We will NEVER be back which as Long Beach locals is sad because we grew up going there. All of our families and friends will know and I hope many others will read this and never go again. On a great note... Hey at least the sushi and Thai place next door knows customer service. The owner is amazing!< /text>

Like the pizza and salad, not a huge fan of the pastas. On a pepperoni pizza, the pepperoni is under the cheese.< /text>

I was looking for a replacement gas range for a unit in our apartment building. Unfortunately our building is in Los Feliz and was outside their delivery area. Clint was extremely helpful in guiding me to a closer appliance store that he knew would have what I was looking for. and did not rush to get off the phone with me once he knew I wasn't going to buy from them. Definitely would recommend them for anyone around the South Bay.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>Wow! I’m in a pinch on a potential new home where the homeowner put in custom cabinets that won’t fit a standard fridge. Armed with measurements I came to South Bay Appliance after googling for a local appliance store, which I know is the BEST place to get your appliances. Well, Clint proved me to be right. This visit was really a consultation, and hey answered all my questions and gave me good information to continue my research at home.

No pressure to buy, no pressure for anything. Just  good information and support.

I highly recommend this location for your appliance needs, and I look forward to purchasing from here whether or not this home purchase comes through in this wild escrow that I’m in.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Purchased a Frigidaire Refrigerator from this store and it was delivered 6/29/2021. It ne er got cold and all of my food ruined.  I'm a disabled person and I contacted them and they came out to check it out and told me that  they ha e to bring out another one. Today is 7/21/2021, and they delivered another Refrigerator. I've been having to eat what ever I can because I can't afford to eat out like that. This place doesn't care about the disabled. They told me that they would not reimburse me for my food that ruined because they sold me a defective Refrigerator. I have had to struggle trying to get food to eat, to no concern of theirs. They don't care about people,  all they care about is money. Please don't waste your hard earned money with them</review><userid>107198252658953041258</userid>< Date>

<review>Very happy with our experience.  Vincent worked with us to locate a refrigerator that would fit in our rental.  And the delivery guys/installers were great too, they had to return a second time because of a problem with our water hookup, no problem and they were polite and professional.

What you get here that you don't get at the big box stores are very knowledgeable salespersons (in our case, Randy) who know the ins and outs of their appliances!  Since replacing appliances can be tricky at times due to the existing hookups and space requirements in your home, these guys really know their stuff and that helps a lot.  Prices are competitive and sometimes even better than at Home Depot or Lowes.  But its the extra  knowledge which makes all the difference!  The installers were really good too!< /Text>

South Bay Appliance came out the same day and completely looked over my dryer, replaced the necessary parts and fixed my dryer.  They were reasonably priced, professional and quick.  I tried Sears first but they charged twice as much, kept me waiting, and then never fixed the dryer. They wanted me to wait a week to come back. Forget Sears - go to South Bay Appliance for great service<//Review>

<review>Terrible repair service. Not prompt whatsoever, and they can't even fix a fridge properly. We have waited over 2 weeks and our fridge still is not running at all. This is despite having two visits and them supposedly replacing the broken parts. Save the hassle and buy elsewhere.< /review>< Pictures>

<userid>107084741797097163557<//userid><Review>My husband and I are really grateful to the South Bay Appliance staff. After several issues stemming from buying a washer/dryer from Home Depot, including a bad installation, South Bay Appliance was recommended as a place where we could go for advice on what to do next. The entire staff took the time to listen to what happened to us and offer suggestions based on their experiences. We're grateful for their time and what they told us, and we would recommend them for any appliance needs or questions.<//Review></record>

In order to maintain the integrity of our in home service, it takes years to train a good repair person and we do not sub contract this work out like most service company's do today.

I walked in to order some parts for my Oven. Although they didn't have the part I was looking for they were very helpful. As I was waiting I checked their showroom and I saw some amazing deals. I definitely will check their store before buying my next appliance.</Text>

<Review>Bought a matching Speed Queen washer (AWN532) and dryer (ADG4BRG) from South Bay Appliance. I went in knowing what I wanted, the sales staff were very helpful, pointing out operating and maintenance tips. No pressure to up-sale me on any other more expensive (and profitable) brands. Delivery was on time and professional. Will definitely go back for my next major appliance purchase. Appliances are all they sell and they service what they sell so they know their merchandise inside and out. Don't bother with the major retailers or big box stores, this local mom & pop store offers the quality customer service you expect.</Review>< rating>

I have an old maytag dryer & usually fix it with myself (sometimes with little help of YouTube videos). As you may know, finding parts can be really challenging & ordering online is way cheaper but sometimes may take weeks. I  have to say they never disappoint me & every single time, I will call before & they make part ready & I just go pick it up same day. I Have special thanks to the lady who works in the part section, She is very knowledgeable & always give great "life saving" advise about little tiny details that even YouTube videos forgetting about it.</Text>

<review>Everyone is super sweet and Doctor Frisch is absolutely amazing! He made an eye exam, something generally a tad concerning for me, enjoyable and was able to help me figure out stuff about my vision I hadn't heard of much! Would recommend!
Also has a wide variety of glasses to choose from, all really interesting! :)< /review>< Pics>

Ive been going to Dr. Frisch since I was a little kid and I'm 25 now. I have always loved how friendly and welcoming they are. The customer service is great and I never have had any trouble of any kind in all my years of going to them. My favorite part are the little cookies they add when I pick up my glasses, it was always the nicest touch and I still love them even as an adult!< /text>

The breath of his knowledge and the thoroughness of his examinations will give you the confidence you need for choosing Dr. Frisch as your optometrist.  The optician and general staff are also top notch.  They will give you all the information you ask for and more.

I should say you feel a sense of comfort and relief when you make the appointment.  The staff here are caring individuals, the covid response and compliance is above the mark.  You  are greeted by taking your temp, the staff is cleaning after each use and I noticed after each entry of patients.  I felt very assured that they took great care in the offices germ detail.  Dr. Frisch was kind and his easy going manner helped in the explanation of medical terms.  Descriptive yet easy to follow.  He explained the state of the art tests in great clarity and followed up with asking if there were any questions.  A conversation instead of a dictum.
I highly recommend them!</text><gmapID>0x80c29a6ec1f60c57:0xea158845951ae519< /gmapID><Name>Terrie Coady< /Name><UserId.>115061341901480793698</UserId.>< date>

Dr. Frisch and staff, Ray and Andrew, were wonderful as always and COVID protected their practice in every way possible to create a safe and comfortable environment. Dr Frisch is the best optometrist in my half century  experience with astigmatism. His exams are thorough, precise and always pleasant because of Dr. Frisch’s expertise and his kindness. Very helpful and knowledgeable staff as well.<//Text>

We have been seeing Dr. Frisch for 7 years.  Dr. Frisch and his staff are very professional and thorough. He takes time in checking our eyes and answers any concern we have. He is no rush and very humorous. He is on top of his specialty by gaining new knowledge and skills and his office is equipped with advanced equipment. His staff Andrew is very friendly and helpful. The office is always very clean. Best optometrist and highly recommended.< /text>

Excellent staff, the two gentlemen in the front are really helpful and they always try their best to help you find a good pair of eye glasses. I met the Dr once and he was the friendliest optometrist I’ve met. Thank you to this wonderful optometrist office. I’m am so glad I came here. I got my new glasses in less than 1 week. Which to me was pretty awesome.<//Review>

Andrew is so helpful and knowledgeable with glass frames, insurance, pics of my retina... and the list goes on.  Sorry I don't remember his name, is there fixing glasses, making appointments.  All three gentlemen are patient very kind and courteous and welcoming.  I was one of the first patients who have been back since COVID and they are great about cleaning things right after being used....I felt very secure and sanitized there!  Great job!!!

< Review>
I have never had a bad experience going to Dr. Frisch’s office! He was the first ever optometrist I went to when I was 12 and coming back to his office at 23 it’s just as warm and friend of an environment as I remembered.</Review>

<Text>Friendly staff, thorough and funny and sweet Dr. Frisch, and with the latest technology. This year my mother was diagnosed with narrow angle, so wanted to do additional tests, just to make sure. Highly recommend, even for a 2nd opinion. Look forward to my yearly exam!</Text>< Resp>

Dr. Michael Frisch is not just extremely knowledgeable, he is always upbeat, on time, and very respectful.  He works collaboratively with us, his patients, discussing any issues or questions we may bring up until we're both sure all aspects have been covered and dealt with.  Unlike some in the medical professions, he is never condescending or short with patients.  With my many moves I've had a number of optometrists over the years, and I can't imagine anyone better to trust my eyes to.  Dr. Frisch has been taking excellent care of me and my family for at least 30 years.</text>

I've gone to EyeCare Optometric Center for a few years now. I originally went there because it was convenient to my home. However, I've stayed because of the fantastic service, wealth of knowledge that Dr. Frisch and his staff have concerning eye care and the friendly atmosphere of everyone there.< /review>

<text>If you are looking for a real intelligent optometrist and amazing staff ..look no further! I was referred here by a friend a few years back and I'll never go anywhere else. The technology and knowledge the doctor has is top notch! I learn something every visit and my daughters vision has improved greatly since going to get yearly check ups and the doctor being very thorough at getting her prescription perfect! I can go on and on but 1 visit and you'll see for yourself. I can't leave out the amazing helping hands and friendly faces that welcome us in the front door every visit! They all are amazing at answering any insurance questions or frames questions etc. They Rock! !< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c29a6ec1f60c57:0xea158845951ae519< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Friendly staff, excellent and efficient service.
Dr. Michael Frisch and his staff, Andrew and Megan are knowledgeable. My wife and I have been going to this office for more than 6 years now. Lyra was the first staff that we met. I used to see Lyra for my eyeglasses maintenance (screws etc. and free cleaning cloth). Then came Andrew and then Megan. They are all courteous and friendly.
Thank you Dr. Frisch, Andrew, Megan and Lyra. I understand that Lyra moved to another state. However, I still want to thank Lyra although she's no longer there.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Excellent optometrist that my family and I have been using for many many years and will continue to use for our future needs. They have the latest "State of the Art" Eye Care equipment in town to keep yours eyes healthy and in-focus. Their selection of eye-wear is extensive and very customer oriented. Overall, I would recommend Dr. Frisch to anyone who is looking for an optometrist in the SF Valley. They take VSP eye insurance.<//Text><user>106101593382530874438</user>< GmapID>

I was originally referred to Dr Frisch by a neighbor in 1997 and I still continue to see him even though I live 45 miles away.  For 20 years I have had very thorough eye exams that Dr Frisch always explains the results to me.  He has up-to-date equipment and has a very professional and knowledgeable staff too.  I know I will continue to see him in the future.<//text>

<text>Kim and Lyra were friendly and efficient. Dr. Frisch was delightful. I had a great time. They also move my husband's appointment so that we both be seen during the same time frame.

I ended up coming in the day after my appointment to try on the glasses I had previously selected as I wasn't 100% in love with them. I then proceeded to try on about 20 more pairs (they have a great selection!) and ended up buying a different pair. Through all of my fussiness both ladies were lovely.

I ended up with some very cute Michael Kors glasses and Tori Burch sunglasses and I look forward to seeing them all next year!< /text>< pics>

Dr. Frisch is the best eye doctor in the universe. He is so knowledgeable and so professional and so thorough.  The eye examination he performs is so thorough and complete. My family and I have been going to Dr. Frisch for over 20 years; there is no one else like him.  He truly is an amazing
awesome doctor.   He can answer any questions you may have.  He gives you all of his time and he makes you feel so important.  He really really cares about his patients. He has the most amazing personality and sense of humor. After your first appointment with Dr. Frisch, you will never go to any other eye doctor again.  He is the best!!!

Andrew is Dr. Frisch's office manager and Ray who also works the front desk are
both so helpful, friendly and accommodating;such a pleasure!

My spouse and I have been going to Dr Frisch for over 20 years! He is extremely knowledgeable, personable, caring and thorough. He is what we all want health care professional's to be, 100% professional, kind & caring.  He also has a good sense of humor! He has a beautiful office and state of the art equipment. The staff is also friendly, knowledgeable and caring. I highly recommend Dr. Frisch & EyeCare Optometric Center of Northridge!<//review>

I always get excellent service in this office.  Dr. Frisch is a joy to deal with, as well as his entire staff.  Customer service is second to none, every time that I come in the friendliness and courtesy of the staff makes me feel welcomed and that they are truly glad to see me.  I’m never rushed and they take time to answer any questions or concerns.
I highly recommend this office, Dr. Frisch and the staff.</Review>

Best eye doctor I've ever been to. Dr Frisch got my corrected vision down to 20/15, and he was so patient with all of my questions! I'm a nursing student, so I asked him all about the causes and symptoms of eye disease, his assessment strategies, and treatments. He answered every question precisely and confidently, and I learned a lot! Most thorough, well done eye exam I've ever had. I've never had a prescription this perfect before, Lens Crafters and Costco completely fail in comparison, it was worth it to have to wait a little for my glasses. And the staff was so cool, they helped me pick out frames that went well with my facial structure and gave excellent fashion advice!<//text>

Dr. Frisch is a dream - he is extremely caring, concerned and takes his time with each examination. I have quite honestly never met a doctor with a more approachable demeanor. His facilities are always clean, his equipment new, and the experience is always impeccable. Dr. Frisch and team are absolutely amazing. HIghly, HIGHLY recommended.</Review>< pics>

He made an eye exam, something generally a tad concerning for me, enjoyable and was able to help me figure out stuff about my vision I hadn't heard of much! Would recommend!
Also has a wide variety of glasses to choose from, all really interesting! :)</Text>< user_id>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Ive been going to Dr. Frisch since I was a little kid and I'm 25 now. I have always loved how friendly and welcoming they are. The customer service is great and I never have had any trouble of any kind in all my years of going to them. My favorite part are the little cookies they add when I pick up my glasses, it was always the nicest touch and I still love them even as an adult!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Dr. Frisch is simply the best there is.  The breath of his knowledge and the thoroughness of his examinations will give you the confidence you need for choosing Dr. Frisch as your optometrist.  The optician and general staff are also top notch.  They will give you all the information you ask for and more.  You will come away with great glasses, choosing from an unbelievably wide selection of glasses and prices, and you will soon see that you're working with a team that will support you in every possible way.</Text>< user>

Office staff is very friendly and attentive. We have been coming to Dr. Frisch's office for a long time. And we absolutely enjoy the conversations we share while he takes care of our eyes. As long as he does not retire we will continue to make our visits. The DeVito Family< /review>

<Text>Clean, efficient, professional, convenient, embracing.  You feel comfort immediately upon entering their office.  I should say you feel a sense of comfort and relief when you make the appointment.  The staff here are caring individuals, the covid response and compliance is above the mark.  You  are greeted by taking your temp, the staff is cleaning after each use and I noticed after each entry of patients.  I felt very assured that they took great care in the offices germ detail.  Dr. Frisch was kind and his easy going manner helped in the explanation of medical terms.  Descriptive yet easy to follow.  He explained the state of the art tests in great clarity and followed up with asking if there were any questions.  A conversation instead of a dictum.
I highly recommend them!< /Text>< pics>

We have been seeing Dr. Frisch for 7 years.  Dr. Frisch and his staff are very professional and thorough. He takes time in checking our eyes and answers any concern we have. He is no rush and very humorous. He is on top of his specialty by gaining new knowledge and skills and his office is equipped with advanced equipment. His staff Andrew is very friendly and helpful. The office is always very clean. Best optometrist and highly recommended.<//review>

<text>Dr Frisch is a VERY patient doctor.  And full of information about eyes.  I've been going to him for over 20 years and he has kept a great watch over my eyes.  Andrew is so helpful and knowledgeable with glass frames, insurance, pics of my retina... and the list goes on.  Sorry I don't remember his name, is there fixing glasses, making appointments.  All three gentlemen are patient very kind and courteous and welcoming.  I was one of the first patients who have been back since COVID and they are great about cleaning things right after being used....I felt very secure and sanitized there!  Great job!!!

<Review>Dr. Michael Frisch is not just extremely knowledgeable, he is always upbeat, on time, and very respectful.  He works collaboratively with us, his patients, discussing any issues or questions we may bring up until we're both sure all aspects have been covered and dealt with.  Unlike some in the medical professions, he is never condescending or short with patients.  With my many moves I've had a number of optometrists over the years, and I can't imagine anyone better to trust my eyes to.  Dr. Frisch has been taking excellent care of me and my family for at least 30 years.</Review><Rate>5< /Rate><username>Beth Ullman<//username><UserId.>113484512360557508162<//UserId.>< gmapID>

I've gone to EyeCare Optometric Center for a few years now. I originally went there because it was convenient to my home. However, I've stayed because of the fantastic service, wealth of knowledge that Dr. Frisch and his staff have concerning eye care and the friendly atmosphere of everyone there.</Text>

<Text>If you are looking for a real intelligent optometrist and amazing staff ..look no further! I was referred here by a friend a few years back and I'll never go anywhere else. The technology and knowledge the doctor has is top notch! I learn something every visit and my daughters vision has improved greatly since going to get yearly check ups and the doctor being very thorough at getting her prescription perfect! I can go on and on but 1 visit and you'll see for yourself. I can't leave out the amazing helping hands and friendly faces that welcome us in the front door every visit! They all are amazing at answering any insurance questions or frames questions etc. They Rock! !< /Text>< pictures>

Dr. Michael Frisch and his staff, Andrew and Megan are knowledgeable. My wife and I have been going to this office for more than 6 years now. Lyra was the first staff that we met. I used to see Lyra for my eyeglasses maintenance (screws etc. and free cleaning cloth). Then came Andrew and then Megan. They are all courteous and friendly.
Thank you Dr. Frisch, Andrew, Megan and Lyra. I understand that Lyra moved to another state. However, I still want to thank Lyra although she's no longer there.</Review><time>1529441372754< /time>< Resp>

I was originally referred to Dr Frisch by a neighbor in 1997 and I still continue to see him even though I live 45 miles away.  For 20 years I have had very thorough eye exams that Dr Frisch always explains the results to me.  He has up-to-date equipment and has a very professional and knowledgeable staff too.  I know I will continue to see him in the future.</Text>

<username>Tiffany Newton<//username><time>1375983221689</time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Kim and Lyra were friendly and efficient. Dr. Frisch was delightful. I had a great time. They also move my husband's appointment so that we both be seen during the same time frame.

I ended up coming in the day after my appointment to try on the glasses I had previously selected as I wasn't 100% in love with them. I then proceeded to try on about 20 more pairs (they have a great selection!) and ended up buying a different pair. Through all of my fussiness both ladies were lovely.

I ended up with some very cute Michael Kors glasses and Tori Burch sunglasses and I look forward to seeing them all next year!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Dr. Frisch is the best eye doctor in the universe. He is so knowledgeable and so professional and so thorough.  The eye examination he performs is so thorough and complete. My family and I have been going to Dr. Frisch for over 20 years; there is no one else like him.  He truly is an amazing
awesome doctor.   He can answer any questions you may have.  He gives you all of his time and he makes you feel so important.  He really really cares about his patients. He has the most amazing personality and sense of humor. After your first appointment with Dr. Frisch, you will never go to any other eye doctor again.  He is the best!!!

Andrew is Dr. Frisch's office manager and Ray who also works the front desk are
both so helpful, friendly and accommodating;such a pleasure!

I always get excellent service in this office.  Dr. Frisch is a joy to deal with, as well as his entire staff.  Customer service is second to none, every time that I come in the friendliness and courtesy of the staff makes me feel welcomed and that they are truly glad to see me.  I’m never rushed and they take time to answer any questions or concerns.
I highly recommend this office, Dr. Frisch and the staff.<//Text>

I love the staff, I love everyone there. Everyone was extreamly helpfull and full of information. I have no intention of going anywhere else.  the selection of frames and glasses was massive and everyone worked with me to find 2 really nice pairs of glasses. I highly recomend this place<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Best eye doctor I've ever been to. Dr Frisch got my corrected vision down to 20/15, and he was so patient with all of my questions! I'm a nursing student, so I asked him all about the causes and symptoms of eye disease, his assessment strategies, and treatments. He answered every question precisely and confidently, and I learned a lot! Most thorough, well done eye exam I've ever had. I've never had a prescription this perfect before, Lens Crafters and Costco completely fail in comparison, it was worth it to have to wait a little for my glasses. And the staff was so cool, they helped me pick out frames that went well with my facial structure and gave excellent fashion advice!</review>< Pics>

Dr. Frisch is a dream - he is extremely caring, concerned and takes his time with each examination. I have quite honestly never met a doctor with a more approachable demeanor. His facilities are always clean, his equipment new, and the experience is always impeccable. Dr. Frisch and team are absolutely amazing. HIghly, HIGHLY recommended.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c29a6ec1f60c57:0xea158845951ae519< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Love this place! Parking is usually good. Artwork and home decor are my go-to's and I always pick up a minimum of two items. Recently found a stamped tin mirror and three pieces of art (one for the frame only and was in excellent condition with the brackets on the back). Prices are very fair and tag color sales posted at front of store.</Review>< Resp>

<review>I made a donation of a very expensive office furniture.   They were going to move it directly to the store to sell it.

They do great work and deserve to be supported< /review>< Date>

I really like their store better than  Goodwill. Their prices reflect gently used, where as the other store is competing with brand new pricings. Sometimes even higher prices. The area is pretty mixed as far as classes so you find some special treasures every now and then, each time is a new adventure.<//text>

<review>There is a new supervisor (?) Micaela that is super mean to the coworkers. I think it was really unprofessional, she should be removed. I love the store, but she ruined my experience. I enjoy the other workers they are super nice, especially Elsa. There are good items and fair prices!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Salvation army store has lot of good items on sale. Especially sofa and dining tables. They are available at a very reasonable price and many are of good quality. We can also get good variety of plates, cups and kitchen utensils. Regarding shoes, chances of getting one of good quality is very less. Clothes are available at a good bargain. You will get almost all items at 50% discount on every last Friday of the month.</Review>< gmapID>

Clothing sizes aren't always in the right sections but you have to dig anyway so have fun with it!

Great savings,packed store. But check what you buy:some items, although they appear new or unused might be duds. Check before buying. No returns.</Text>

Let me start by saying, I love shopping in the Salvation Army Stores. They always have great stuff, good buys, nice prices.
This one however:
I arrived one day, a Saturday, no parking.
"Hmm", I thought, "it must just be a busy weekend".
I arrived one day, a Friday evening. No parking.
"Oh", I thought, "Friday night, everyone's out, I understand.
I arrived one day, a MONDAY at 2:30 PM. No parking.
"well, that's it, never coming back here".

So there you have it. For some inexplicable reason, they never have any parking. I'm guessing it's because of the bus station next door. Regardless, if I can't park, I can't shop.< /text>

Thrifting is the best way to get great clothes on the cheap. Salvation Army and Goodwill are the best for this. Great place! But, remember, thrifting is mostly luck. Very hit-or-miss.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Hello, I want to share an experience that I had today. I went to the store early and a young man named Jonny attended to me and I said Hello in Spanish and he does not answer me. Then I said hi and he answered me angrily. I already answered you but his character was very strong. I really wanted to do something about it but I didn't have enough time. But he made me feel so bad

We have been over the top pleased with our experiences. The repair rep is very personable, professional & respectful of property. Easy to contact and schedule by phone with courteous employees. Highly recommend. We are on a annual check up plan for AC & Heating therefore we don’t have to worry about issues during the summer or winter.</Text>

CM Heating would love to take a moment to thank the awesome crew at Lee's Air Conditioning Heating & Building Performance in Fresno for sharing their time and space with us recently. It was an awesome experience collaborating with a top notch organization. For anyone in the Fresno area looking for some help with their home comfort system, this is the only company to call.< /review>

Super happy I chose Lee’s to call for my water heater. Sean did a great job getting my hot water up and running. He got the parts quickly and had my house back up and running in no time. Not only that, he was patient with me and talked me through what was wrong and how he could help. He even unclogged a drain my 4 year old stuffed with toilet paper the night before while he was on hold with the water heater vendor. Major multitasker! I felt like he wasn’t trying to hide costs or over charge me. He was upfront and honest. I will call Lee’s every time I have a plumbing or air issue at my home. THE BEST!< /text>

<Review>Fast Professional installation of a new disposal in my kitchen sink. Willing to take time to answer questions and explain work.  Very personable.  Another visit: Michael did a thorough job and cleaned up after himself.  Took some time to play with my dog instead of asking me to remove her.  Will definitely request him again.<//Review>< Rate>

Gustavo Martinez was my technician today. He was on time, professional, and reaponsive. He did wear a face mask when he arrived at my home. He performed an HVAC maintenance for me today and provided me with a detailed verbal report on the condition of my machine. He provided me with 1 recommendation that was not urgent, but I decided to make the repair at that moment to avoid any failures in the future. Gustavo did the simple repair right away. Overall he did an excellent job and I am pleased with the maintenance he did on my machine. He cleaned up after himself when he completed his tasks. I will certainly call Lee's Air again on my next maintenance and will request Gustavo to come back if possible.  Thank you.</text>

Plumbing dept service team was fast and safe    Well knowledge and polite..thank goodness!
Living in an older single fam takes responsibility as well as resilience...and the Lee’s team knew what they were doing.knowledge and quick-whether it was skill on site or computer accuracy., thanks to Sean, the supervisors and office communications I have water AND it’s not being wasted by constant leaks and issues.
I am impressed and now I’ll refer the Lee’s team to do my house maintenance/repairs because I know they will do it once  and do it safe and right-Sharon G Deis, Clovis Ca

Our Technician Jesse was very professional in trying to find our shower odor issue and did. We do highly recommend Lee’s A/C and Plumbing for your home needs since we wasted more money trying to go through our Home Insurance who were a waste of our time and in the end not experienced enough to handle a house call because they care more of the quantity of services performed and not the quality of work to take care of the customer. We do not recommend other services such as City Plumbing who states they don’t investigate and definitely not T & N Plumbing And Electrical who  stated he could not smell the odor which was obvious at the time and changed a spout that was not the underlying issue. Lee’s is the way to go in our experience for future issues.< /Text>

<review>Needed a clog in my drain cleared. When I first contacted the company I informed them that I had the drain cleared by another company 2 months ago. Ask if they warranted their service. Was told it depended on the type service preformed. I told her the drain was backing up. She told me someone would have to come out. When he came out I explained the problem to him and ask if they would provide a warranty for clearing the drain and he said no. They do not provide warranties for drain clearing. Now I am out $49 and my time to hear something that could have been told me over the phone. OUCH!</review><Resp>{'time': 1614022548283, 'text': 'Hello Eric, thank you for the review on what we can do better. We apologize for the miscommunication from our team.

Jessie repaired a “plugged pipe in the bathroom at my rental at 4848 E Amherst.  I was  Very pleased with how he kept me informed, by phone, about the problem and how he would be fixing it.  He told me it would be a little more expensive the way he had to get on the roof to unstop the pie, than I was expecting to pay for the repair job, but I understood that because it is an old house it had to be handled differently.  Jessie seemed very polite and as far as I  know , a good job.  I haven’t heard any complaints from my renters.  Thank You, Nancy Shroyer</text>

<Review>My toilet started making terrible noises.  They set up an appointment, got here on time and fixed the issue within 20 or so minutes of him getting here.  Sean the plumber was very nice, explained what the problem was and answered my questions.  I was referred to them by another plumber that wasn’t able to get here when I needed.  That is how business should be done.  I’m very impressed with all parties!!  I highly recommend Lee’s!<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I called Lee's to fix our broken water wipe in the backyard. They were very friendly and helped me understand the problem without panicking. Juan Cabrera, their serviceman, located the source of the leak immediately. With 20 years of experience, Juan explained the problem and the solution in an easy way to understand. Juan earned our trust immediately. He was a professional, hard worker who showed respect for the property  and was friendly too. If we need Lee's for future plumbing work, we will be sure to ask for Juan Cabrera.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I have a couple buildings in the Los Angeles area and am very satisfied with the company I use.
When we purchased a second home at Millerton lake about 5 years agoI knee  we had to find the same up here.
Finding Lee’s was a real treasure. The bonus was calling yesterday and they responded the same day.
On top of that it was when the service showed up , it was the same crew. Ebert and Jim!
For those of you that haven’t experienced them,  they are what other plumbing company’s advertise they are. The difference is they are the real deal!
Words to describe them
Prompt
Dependable
Courtesy
Great work
Competitive price
Honest

Ebert , I hope these review finds it way to you.

<Text>Lees is one of they places that says what they do and does what they say.  What they quoted was exactly what they charged.  Unlike contractors that nickel and dime you tell you they are only charging what they do.   Lees charged what they said.  They even deducted the cost of the work estimate.  The plumbing technician Sean was very knowledgeable and courteous.  The only negative as they move the work date twice and ultimately it was a day later that the original date.

<Text>My AC went out on a Sunday so there was a $69 extra fee to come out. The issue was diagnosed Sunday and the repairs were performed on that following Tuesday. The house got up to 92* and we were miserable. Wish we could have gone someplace to get cool but it's not possible for us. The tech had to leave in the middle of the repair because he wasn't feeling well and he did look like he was overheating himself. They sent another tech right away and he finished the job with no trouble. It was an expensive repair, however, major parts were replaced. It's the day after nd I'm satisfied with the results. I'm considering taking them up on their maintenance plan of $200+ a year for peace of mind. I would use them again unless I were to find another qualified company that's less expensive, and moreso, willing to get the job done sooner since we're not in the best health and had to suffer longer than we hoped. There was no preferential treatment for the handicapped.< /Text><user_id>102750154340522558609</user_id></record></dataset><record>

DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY - UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP, so disregard all reviews over 12 months old - they were reviewing the OLD management and services, look at ALL the recent 1* reviews, and BE WARNED!

The new owners are NOT forthright nor transparent - with their deceptive, dishonest, unscrupulous  business practices. Charged us $2000+ to replace the OEM ECM blower motor and all the invoice says is, "ECM Blower Motor - Includes all time and material associated with the procurement and replacement." Absolutely ZERO explanation of how they came up with that figure and from the top down, this company is REFUSING to provide me with an itemization of charges. WHY? What are they HIDING?

Probably the fact they charged me, more than likely, a 300+% markup for the part and at least $250/hr to replace it (took the tech roughly 2 hours to complete). The absolute MOST I could find this part selling for online was  $500. And how much did they actually charge me to 'procure' it? What kind of company charges an additional separate fee to drive down to the parts store to get the dang part? Heck, some part stores may actually deliver for free for all I know!

This type of behavior is simply CRIMINAL! THEY REFUSE TO BREAK DOWN THE CHARGES! They had to come up with that figure SOMEWHERE - - - so JUSTIFY them to me. Unless they're fraudulent and hyper-inflated, which I believe they are. Like I said, what are they hiding?

I plan on filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau - they should be COMPELLED and legally BOUND to provide an itemization! If/when they do I'll post an image of that as well. This was NOT a $2000+ repair and they KNOW it.

THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED! PLEASE BOYCOTT THIS COMPANY! They took advantage of 2 retired senior citizens (one disabled) and they'll do the same to YOU!< /review>

Ebert was dispatched to repair our under-sink plumbing in the kitchen.  The metal trap rusted through, and water would run out whenever the faucet was turned on.  He was great!  He called an hour ahead of time to let us know when to expect him;  and he arrived 10 minutes early.  He took a look under the sink;  and gave us 2 different estimates dependent on the severity of the damage.  He showed us a clog in the drain, which he was able to clear out of the pipe and get the new trap installed.  He quoted me a price to replace the kitchen sink;  and processed my payment....all within less than an hour of arrival!  He is very good natured and thorough at what he does.  I recommend Ebert to anyone that runs into a plumbing problem!  Hs is very neat, and cleaned up after his work nicely!</text>

Called about leak detection and explained our our situation in detail.  The person said on the phone it would cost $49.95 for someone to come out and assess/find the issue.  The plumber came, looked around the house and did not locate the leak.  Then the plumber explained it would cost us roughly $500 to find the leak.  “BIG” waste of time/money to find out what we already knew, that we needed to find the leak.<//Review>

Lee's was able to get someone to look at my AC the day after I called.  Aaron, the repairperson, was on time and had the issue fixed within a few hours.

As is always the case, with Lee’s Air, the techs are safety conscious, courteous and professional. Derek Marks is no exception. Appointments were confirmed and calls to advise when he would arrive were received. He performed the regularly scheduled heater maintenance, and outlined exactly what was done. Images were provided to support the work that was done. During our casual discussion, Derek suggested, and recommended, the iWave, because I mentioned that my wife suffered from allergies. Although I didn’t have the iWave installed during his initial visit, Derek followed up with a call a couple days after his visit. My wife and I decided to have the iWave installed, and it was done professionally and without issue. Again, Derek reviewed the work that was done, and completed the job very quickly and efficiently. Prior to leaving, Derek performed a cursory review of a separate mini-split system for future consideration and service. ‘Hats Off’ to Lee’s Air, and Derek, for being customer driven and conducting business accordingly. Without reservation, I recommend Lee’s Air for your plumbing and HVAC needs.<//text>

My review would’ve been a five star everything was great about this company, except it took them 21 days to take the funds for the charge of the repair. The payment was made on a debit bank card  and I’m not really sure why it took so long.
I would definitely recommend this company for repairs on your conditioner. I would have paid cash if I would’ve known it would’ve taken this long to withdraw the funds, personally I don’t like things hanging out there especially with a debit card which most companies deduct right away the next one or two days. Great company great service the repair guy was excellent and very professional, I would recommend this company for the service.< /Review>

Ebert came to our house to help us with a water heater which was improperly installed. He was extremely knowledgable, friendly and professional. We decided to take his advice and he made us an appointment to fix the issue immediately. Ebert was great to work with and would definitely call Lee's again.</review>

<Text>M. Sanders was very professional. We called for a leak at the base of our toilet and he was able to have it fixed within an hour. He was very clean and even took out the trash bag in the bathroom. Not only was he kind with me but took the time to briefly chat with my kiddos. Would definitely recommend Lee’s for plumbing and we will definitely be using them in the future.< /Text><pics>None</pics><user>104985756464065574010<//user>< user_name>

These guys are great.  Have been super helpful in every way.  We are remodeling, came over and moved vents, no charge.  I had AC go out in heat wave, were there that day, fixed and all was under warranty.

Everyone has been super helpful and I want to thank Francisco and Justin for all their help.

From getting a quote to a finished job Lee's air conditioning gets an A+. The technician was professional, knowledgeable, and no pressure sales. He gave me my options and left it for me to decide. I believe he was honest with me during the whole ordeal and that's why for future services I'm calling them first</review>

In the middle of the hot day today my Air conditioning  system Got stuck on 78 degrees. I called Lees Air and in short time I got Mr. Aaron to came to my rescue. Such a professional respectful gentleman, straight to the point who diagnosed the problem gave me photos and estimate and in a very short time my home is cooling off and my family are so happy including my lovely dogs.
Thank you so much, Aaron and many thanks to Lees Air for you excellent choice by having Aaron on your team. 👍🙏< /Text>

My husband and I live in a 2 story house and our AC decided to break down right in the middle of a heat wave. We contacted Lee's Air for a repair quote and the tech came out a week later. He told us it was broken and suggested we get a new system because fixing the old unit would be very expensive. We agreed and that is probably for the best. Then a second individual came out, made some observations, then said he would email us a quote. It has been nearly 3 weeks now and after several calls from my husband and myself, no email. We are now facing another heat wave with no AC. They still want us to pay $100 for them to tell us "it's broken" which we already know. For $100, they could AT LEAST give us an estimate for a new AC. We now have to reach out to another company, pay another $100 but hopefully they will help us. I'm incredibly disappointed with Lee's Air. $100 down the drain when it could have gone to a company who would of at least helped us. I own a small business and I would never neglect my clients like this.< /text>

<review>Francisco Ramos was just here to do the followup inspection on the HVAC system Lee's installed in my house. He did a very thorough job, taking pictures of every step of the process. He answered all my questions and showed me how to properly replace my filter. I'm totally sold on Lee's.<//review><gmapID>0x80946f511471f3a9:0x7ee5494a56bea370</gmapID>< Time>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>Responsive, professional, and speedy repair to my AC unit in the midst of this severe heat wave.  Aaron, the serviceman, had been out to my home before and I had purchased an annual service plan at that time. So glad to see him again!  He was familiar with my equipment and diagnosed the problem speedily.  Nonfunctioning AC was fixed - humming and cooling my house in 5 minutes!  Aaron is a personable, professional service rep who told me he "loved the job."  Perfect service from my initial phone contact to the fix.  Lee's is a wonderful company that delivers and with staff like Aaron who enthusiastically provide critical expertise during routine calls and in SOS times they are the BEST!  PS I'm also so glad I had the service contract, otherwise I might have had to wait a week for service in the heat wave crunch.  I recommend Lee's HVAC and also getting the annual service contract!< /Text><date>1598055071884<//date>< Rating>

Tech called 30 min before arrival. Got there right on time and was very courteous. Went right to work after I explained the issue. After a few min of Diagnostics he found the problem and explained to me what it was and gave me a price on the spot to fix the problem. Whole thing took just about an hour.. Very happy with the whole experience.. Thank you< /review>

Jesus was earlier than quoted which is unheard of these days. He was quick to diagnose the issue, patient for us to give him an answer on how to fix it. He is very knowledgeable and respectful as well. All in all, I would not hesitate recommending Lee's Air.

I went through 3 other companies before calling Lee's to service my furnace due to a odor of Gas coming from the unit itself. The 3 previous companies all stated they could not detect or smell a gas leak to which I was shocked because the entire closet that housed the furnace wreaked of gas while the valve was on. First 2 companies said to just change the filter and that would fix the smell obviously that did not work nor would that have been the fix for it issue. 3rd company did as the first and sprayed solution to detect a leak and said they couldn't find any. However they did clean the sensor saying that would fix the problem all while the odor of gas was lingering while they were working. Like the previous two the 3rd said they dont smell gas and i was good to use the heater. 10mins after leaving I could still smell gas. I shut the valve off and called Lee's. The very next day the Lee's tech arrived named Peter. I had turned the gas back on 5 mins prior to hus arrival and once the furnace door was open he immediately identified the smell of gas. I had explained to peter the ongoing situation and previous experiences and within minutes of arriving identified the LEAKS one off the thermostat and other off the flex pipes and began to fix the issues. Having 5 minor kids in my household and the weather getting colder getting the heat back on was paramount. Peter was very professional, courteous, and walked me through the problem and how he was going to fix it. Lee's service is who I should have called in the beginning. Peter from the start was very attentive and understanding to my concerns and frustration being he was the 4th technician to look at my furnace. He methodically went through the furnace to ensure everything was in working order and explained to me what he was doing to put my mind at ease for the safety of my family. Had I gone off the others techs ok who knows what would have happened. I highly recommend Lee's Air Conditioning, Heating and plumbing. If all their techs are like Peter you will have a tech who cares about you getting the repairs and service you need, and puts the highest quality and care into their work.< /Text>

<Review>Just had technicians Pedro and Luis repair my AC. Great guys! This blasted Fresno heat strikes at the worst times like a 107 day. My AC capacitor was replaced with a much better 'heavy-duty' unit. They also serviced and cleaned out the AC. Hope I didn't hover over them too much, but they provided great information about my AC and other unrelated electrical questions. Lee's Air was extremely busy this past weekend, but they arrived on time ready to go. Pedro and Luis' work and professionalism is to be commended. Thanks again, JA< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< Review>
Service was excellent, timely and courteous. However I thought the
charge of $800 for 5# of freon was outrageous. I since have made
other inquiries at local sources and found prices at $50 to $100
normal.< /Review>

<Text>John came early, thank goodness. It was a day that was going to reach 106°-107°!  The night before (11:30pm) our a/c started making a horrible screeching noise, so I had to turn it off. I texted with the chat , told the person what had happened. She said someone would call me first thing in the morning. Right around 8:30 the office called and said a tech could come out at 1:00. He (John) got there a little before 12:30.  Went right to work. He fixed it and was here for quite a while. Fixed it all!! Very professional, friendly, Cleaned up, flipped it on and it was so nice
If I needed anything again I’m hoping he is available. Everyone I talk to about Lee’s that has used them and always had good things to say.
Reasonably priced too.
My neighbors and 2 other friends recommended them. Great Job!

<text>We contacted Lee's Air regarding replacement of our Heating and Air conditioning unit. We had an appointment within one day to meet with a representative, Frank Sanchez to look at our system and discuss options for replacing the units on our split system. Frank explained the new technology and we decided on replacing both systems on Wednesday and we they were able to schedule the replacement for the following Monday.
The crew of two showed up on time as promised and the job was completed in the time that we were told. The techs, Dan and Mike were courteous, friendly and very careful. They cleaned up after each days work and explained the new system as the installation progressed.
We are completely satisfied with the whole process of upgrading our systems and everyone that we worked with at Lee's Air.< /text></record>

Ebert Bissett did an outstanding job for our plumbing needs today !!  I would recommend Lee's Air Conditioning, Heating and Building to everyone. Lee's work quality is top notch, professional and great value for the money.  We have used them for four years and met them when they rescued us on the Fourth of July when our air conditioner went out on a 113 degree day!! Great Job Lee's!!!<//text>

Francisco arrived right at the end of the 2 hour window.  Once on site his work was methodical and thorough.  The diagnosis took apx. 2 hours and his prognosis was exactly what I already knew.  Meaning he didn't fudge the numbers.  Well done!!!!<//text>

Technician was mindful of not bringing dirt into my house by wearing booties over his shoes.
He explained what he did to my air conditioning unit after he finished. He even fixed the whirly bird unit that wasn’t working on top of my roof. I am happy with his work.</review>

<Text>My A/C was not blowing cold air, and it was approaching 90 degree weather. Lee's Air Conditioning was able to come out the next day, showed up early, and fixed multiple issues. The technician Francisco was very professional, efficient, and had 3 separate parts replaced in about an hour. I signed up right then for their service contract. I recommend Lee's Air Conditioning.<//Text>< pictures>

To techs arrived within allotted time. Both were courteous and professional. The senior tech quality checked the other text work. They showed me pictures of what they found, explain the significance and any repairs or service that they did before they did it. We also discussed a little about the history of the company, it was family-owned for many years. When the owner retired, and employee purchased it and continues to tradition of family ownership. I would confidently recommend this company to anyone who needs HVAC services.<//review>

Thank you so much to San for diagnosing my issues and Aaron for taking the time to answer all of my questions and walking me through the process, you are truly a Comfort Specialist. Alex and Corey were amazing with the installation, we spent three days together and I was so impressed with their knowledge and skill. My system works beautifully and I couldn't be happier. Each person I dealt with was very thorough, honest, open, provided me with options and were very patient answering my questions and addressing my concerns. I would recommend them without hesitation!

Plumbers came on this visit. They were professional and courteous. I was kept up to date with emails and text messages during the day so I knew who would be arriving. I enjoy  having a maintenance contract with Lee's Air. It’s one less thing to worry about!</text>

Lee's Air has taken care of our AC and heating needs for years.  Yesterday, they installed a new AC unit for us.  Alfredo Borja and David Amador worked at our home from 9:30 am to 8 pm.  They were both professional, respectful and accommodating throughout the process- really decent guys- and dedicated to getting it done right.  Lee's Air is an well-run business.  I highly recommend them.<//text>

We always love working with Lees. This service was no exception. Our AC started making noise and when we got the repair tech out we got he bad news that it was a blown motor. Not the news anyone wants. They informed us that our unit was still miraculously under warranty and helped us through the whole process. While we did still get hit with part of the repair bill it was no where near what the repair would have been if our tech had not double checked and figured out that our unit was still under warranty, we had no idea! They were amazing and within 24 hours of our service call we were up and running again....even during the Covid-19 crisis and shelter in place.<//Review>

< Review>
If you are looking for a company that will provide excellent service and reasonable rates, look no further. Our A/C stopped working this summer. We had a house full of out of town guests that arrived for our sons wedding. They sent Alfredo out here that evening to help us. He did everything he could that night to make us comfortable. Also, he made numerous phone calls to track down the parts he needed and rearranged his schedule to complete the job the next day. Now that's service! Through the entire process he explained what he was doing and why it needed to be done. Also, kept us informed regarding the cost of everything too.
Every year I purchase their maintenance package that offers a twice a year tune up for our A/C and heater. It also offers a discount on parts should they need to repair your unit. Just had Alfredo out here the other day to work on our heater. So the discount really helped. He is always so nice and respectful. I always ask for him, and he always remembers us. We are very happy with this company and will never use anyone else.</Review>

I called about going from electric to gas. It was pricey but the tech that came out was great. Talked about the different things he would do, and what we needed to get what we wanted. He was very knowledgeable about the process, and had answers for our questions. He was very friendly on top of that and made us feel like it wasn't just a job he stayed a bit after to talk a little more. I'm sure we will end up getting the work done primarily because of him.< /review>

This is a top notch outfit. I used them for plumbing as well as air conditioning and really could not be happier. The company has an incredible infrastructure that provides on the spot pricing. They send reminders to u of the service calls and then follow up with a final reminder the day of, that includes a picture of who is coming to perform the work. All of their employees have been courteous, knowledgeable, professional and efficient. I really could not have asked for, or expected more.</review>

My service provider was on time friendly and proficient. He communicated before during and after installing my garbage disposal. He conveyed confidence in completing the task and gave me a fair price.</Review>

The ac isn't working right😭 thank you for reaching out to address issue. I appreciate it. 💯👍🏻and when I called back the staff was very polite and informative. Told me if I had anymore issues just call.</Review>

<Text>We just had our new Lennox AC/furnace installed on our roof and my husband and I are thrilled.  LeesAir is so professional, knowledgeable and friendly from top to bottom.  First we met Jared and San who explained what was wrong with our very old equipment and what they would do for us.  Then Alexander Cisneros and Michael Ruiz spent just 3days installing our new equipment and removing all of the old filthy equipment and ducting.  We were without air less than an hour!  They were both great guys and did amazing work and even better than that they made a great team!  We also appreciated the additional help from another Mike and Jared on the last day. We are old and electronically challenged. Alexander showed us how to use the new thermostat and app.  He was so patient!!  I highly recommend LeesAir!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1589589481365, 'text': "Thank you so much for your kind words and it's our pleasure to serve!"}< /Response>< gmap_id>

John Arias was here for routine servicing today and was super nice and thorough.  They texted the day before to remind us of the appointment and called the day of to give a more specific time of arrival.  We then received a text the day of telling us who would be coming (with a photo of the person coming - nice!)  That text also had a link to click to see exactly where their staff was on a map while en route and a phone number link.     Lee's always does a great job for us and their messaging format is super convenient.  We're really impressed with the extra level of customer service.< /text>

< Review>
Dishonest, overpriced, deceptive and pushy are all words I would use to describe my experience with Lee's air.  I called to have my air conditioner looked at and the air handler. They told me my heat exchanger had holes in it and was leaking carbon monoxide into my house. Within an hour they had a salesman out to sell me a system (2x the price of 3 competitors.) I called out 2 other people to check my system and they said while the system was old, that is was not broken or leaking carbon monoxide. So lee's tech is either incompetent or dishonest. My gut feeling after the rest of my intersection with lee's is dishonest. They also have some sort of "rebate" through pge that they use to "save" you money. I never found any information from pge about it. No other ac company knew anything about it and when I asked the guy doing the "pge test" for a copy of the information he would not give it to me. The rep from lee never gave me any documentation of this program and only gave me a generic program name, again, I never found anything from pge on this. They wanted me to sign for a crazy expensive system right there that night. I did I was going to shop aground. After the rep found out that I was truly shopping around he stopped calling. My guess is because he was trying to sell me a system for $45k with add-ons I didn't really need when I eventual found a top tier system for less than half that price. Do not trust these guys. Get a second opinion. In my case an extra $150 for a tech from a different company saved me over $20,000.< /Review>

{'time': 1590789693046, 'text': 'Hi Jason, thanks for the feedback. We never advertise ourselves as being the lowest price, only taking the best care of our customers and we take great pride in having the best techs and installers in the area. I don\'t know what was "dishonest, deceptive, and pushy." Our technician used a inspection scope and your heat exchanger is rusted and compromised in spots and you were shown the images we took. Maybe the other company just took a glance at it and couldn\'t see the issue. For units that are as old as yours, we recommend replacement and of course we work as hard as we can to take care of our customers and get the correct staff to your home in a timely manner. The energy program that was mentioned can be found here: https://comfortablehomerebates.com/ and we are one of three companies in Fresno that have met the rigorous standards to participate in it so it doesn\'t surprise me that whoever you had out after us had never heard of it. Hope you have a great and comfortable summer!'}</response>

Also provided me with pictures of what he found. He gave me information about our unit that I didn't know Did not try to sell me services or a new air conditioning unit I didn't need even though ours is 22 years old. Very personable & professional. I will certainly call Lee's when I need services.</Review>< Pictures>

After calling several companies to have my AC unit serviced after it stopped working, Lee's Air Conditioning was the only company able to schedule me in on the same day.  The technician was prompt and sent a text message with his photo letting me know that he is on his way.  He then followed up the text message with an actual call informing me of the exact time of his arrival.

The AC unit was diagnosed in a timely manner and was informed from a third party vendor that the part required to repair it was going to take a week to a week and a half before it arrives in their warehouse.  Mark, the technician, went above and beyond calling all of the vendors who sold that part and found one who could get it to us in a day and a half.  He called me up immediately and let me know of his findings and so I quickly agreed to the work order.  On the day the part arrived, Lee's Air Conditioning coordinated a time a full day before the projected date of repair knowing we were without an AC unit in triple digit heat.  Again, Mark was sent out to conduct the repair work and he ultimately performed the work in the time frame he specified.  He again displayed why Lee's Air Conditioning is a top rated company by working expeditiously, and even did some bonus work for me free of charge to ensure that the AC unit was working in the most efficient manner.

I was extremely impressed with Mark and the company he represents.  I will now be using Lee's Air Conditioning for all of my future AC unit issues!  I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone desiring great service and professional technicians like Mark!< /Review>

I urge anyone doing business with this firm to be certain of all costs before you hire them.  I was ripped off. My neighbor who had them install a new HCAC system was not happy with their work and will never use them again.  I do not believe this is a honest or trustworthy firm.<//text>

Lees Air conditioning was called this morning because one of our units was not working.
They called back within an hour and set up an appt for today. The technician arrived at 1:30.
Pedro was exceptionally Polite, Knowledgeable and Efficient.  He installed the necessary repairs at a fair price and by 5:00 pm  our Air Conditioning was back working. Thank you Lee’s Air! *****< /text>

<text>My air-conditioning unit wasn’t working and I contacted them early in the morning. The customer service representative was very attentive and was able to get someone to my location within an hour. The Service specialist  promptly called me and let me know his expected arrival time. He arrived exactly on time, he introduced himself he was very respectful and courteous. He was very open to all of my questions and very helpful with suggestions on how to upkeep my unit. I would definitely recommend this company again especially the service specialist David Cardenas.< /text><GmapID>0x80946f511471f3a9:0x7ee5494a56bea370<//GmapID><username>Tehauna Ponce<//username>< user_id>

We highly recommend Lee’s Air.  Everyone we dealt with from the first call made to having the new work tested was friendly, honest, and professional. The whole process of have our ducting replaced was fast and easy. 1 day to remove the old and 1 day to put in the new. Kevin M & Alex C were very professional, friendly and Clean. They kept us informed throughout the process. What difference in heating our home.
Thank you to all at Lee’s Air</Review>

<Review>Needed help with my grill in my backyard. With no idea what I was doing I reached out to Lee 's Air. Notably, they were the least costly and most responsive service - they set up an appointment with me the next day.

I was helped by Armando A. who was very knowledgeable, kind, and thorough. I didn't have the parts needs for the job, but he made sure that I knew exactly what to pick up at the store to get the results I wanted. After his explanation I feel confident in handling the job myself, and he went above and beyond to make that a fact.

Despite this call being mostly informational I am convinced of Armando and this company's performance and professionalism. I would recommend their service to anyone. No brainer for the 5 stars!</Review>< Pics>

I recently purchased a complete split system HVAC unit from Lee's.  I worked with several different staff and each one provided excellent service.  They were thorough and they followed up when they said they would and to coordinate the inspections.  The technicians/installers Kevin and Andrew are some of the hardest working men I've seen.  They worked hard and long hours, in the heat!!  They knew what they were doing,  very knowledgeable, trustworthy; a neat and clean job for sure.   They went over and above to make the customer happy.  (Thanks again you two)!!!!</Review>

For months our AC would cool intermittently and the system was only 5 years old. With a newborn in the house, we needed to get it diagnosed. Had David come by and he found my AC compressor was failing. Luckily he checked and it was still under the manufacturers warranty, savings us some cash! That deserves a 5 star rating right there! We are located in Suisun City, so don’t be, they do service other areas besides Fresno. Thanks again for your help! -Sophia<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>This company was recommended to repair my air conditioner. The tech was friendly and worked quickly. BUT the part that he spent 15 mins to install cost us $330......I can purchase the EXACT same part on amazon for $65. I’m all for some product markup but 5 1/2 TIMES the original cost of the item is ridiculous. Called and asked to speak to a manager, still waiting on a call back. Will never use this company again and will tell everyone I know not to use them either.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1567791640515, 'text': "Hi Carly, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with Lee's Air. I apologize it took a day to get in touch with you after you called to speak with a manager. We are usually quicker to respond and this will be brought up in our customer service weekly training. I am sorry that our part pricing was 5 1/2 times the cost of the part on Amazon & at Walmart. Our parts and labor come with warranties on repairs and simply costs us money to stock our trucks with parts to be able to perform some repairs on the same day as a diagnostic along with the fuel and an experienced (went to school for HVAC) technician wages. Unfortunately, we can not warranty a customer supplied part & majority of contractors do not either. We can install some customer supplied parts but again, there is no warranties on the part. For the concept of how much time it took to address the issue and perform a repair, we do our best to employee specialists that have training and education in the industry to be efficient with their time so we can get to many homes in one day when their AC units are down. After looking into the appointment, repair, and discussion with our service manager Jared, I am happy to hear that a fair solution was found and a refund was made with our 100% satisfaction guarantee.  If there is any other concerns you would like to discuss, please feel free to reach out and thank you for the opportunity to serve you.\nBailey Thompson\nMarketing Manager"}</resp>

<Text>Just recently completed a new roof when my a.c. unit took a  dump, so I had to get a new one. Did my research and asked around,  found Lee's Air.  These guys are the real deal. I was already stressing about installing a unit on top of new roof.  Couldn't have picked a better choice.  Lee's took care of everything and were very patient and reassuring.  They came out three different times to answer all my questions and concerns before I decided to pull the trigger. Talk about patience. Everyone was pleasant and understanding.  Thank You Aron.
Now, my installers were Ruben P and Korey S.   Knowledgeable, professional, courteous, hard-working, a real couple of apex players and hard hitters.   These guys know their stuff,  don't mess around and don't cut corners.  Ruben and Korey did everything from the duct work to the unit install.  Try  that in 130 degrees in the attic and again didn't cut corners.  They were also very, very, very cognizant of my new roof and the concerns I had with it being new.
Ruben, I thank you, my spouse thanks you and my 4 dogs thank you.  We are pleased to be a part of the "Lee's family".<//Text>< Resp>

<Review>This was by far my best experience with any contractor over the past 20 plus years of home ownership. Because of the confidence I had in Ebert and his abilities I will call Lee's plumbing and request Ebert for all future jobs. This is some of the reasons for my rating.

Upon arrival he handed me a card and I was able to compare the photo (sent by Lee's plumbing) to the person at the door. He also asked if I had received the text and took off his sun glasses so I could better see him. As a women in the home this was a very big deal for me.  He arrived on time, put on shoe covers to protect my floor, and left work site clean and neat.  He fully explained what needed to be done, with what parts, and why.  Any most importantly he gave a fair quote and at completion of the job the actual bill was the same as the quote.

Thank you Lee's Plumbing and especially Ebert.<//Review>< name>

<text>I called Lee's and a couple days later I had a new air conditioner on top of my house! Frank came out and explained all the options for financing and units and rebates and all that. Very informative and super friendly. Jose and Kory came out a couple days later and went right to work; went into the attic, ripped out the old ducting, the next day they installed the new ducting and the unit on top of the house. These guys were awesome, super-hard workers. They answered all my stupid questions with a smile.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Yesterday morning we had no hot water. I called into Lee's and was able to get on the schedule by early afternoon. Ebert showed up and was completely helpful. He came for the diagnostic, but was so much more helpful than that. I felt comfortable to be honest with what we want to do. Though we ended up making the major fix on our own, it would not have been nearly as easy without Lee's showing up so quickly and efficiently. I hope I never have to, but if I do, I will be calling again! Thank you for a great business!<//Review>< Pics>

The Lee's Air team came out to my house to replace the old duct system as part of some additional renovations we are making to the home.  I couldn't be happier with the professionalism, communication and quality of work.  Can't wait to see the increase in airflow and comfort as well as a lower PG&E bill.  Justin, Anthony, Kevin & Cory were all easy to work with and very helpful!<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>A tech came to my house on 12/16/2019  to service the heater as part of a maintenance plan we had purchased.  The heater was working fine this was just a routine maintenance visit. He replaced the filter in the house then went on the roof to inspect the unit. After 4 hours of climbing up and down to turn the propane off and then back on again to the entire house I asked if there was a problem. He proceeded to tell me that the gas shut off valve was stuck open and the valve body inside the unit was leaking and needed to be replaced at a cost of $1100 plus $300 to replace the stuck valve. Being a construction worker for 25 years I knew the stuck shutoff valve cost around $10 at any hardware store and would take about 10 minutes to change I told him not to repair the until. He then told me he would have to disable the unit because of the leak as mandated by state law and did just that and then left.

The next morning I woke to a 60° house and decided to replace the stuck valve myself.  20 minutes later and a total cost of $15 valve problem solved.  I then called my propane supplier and told them what the tech from Lee's had told me and asked if they could do a leak test on the unit. They sent a tech out and he tested for leaks and inspected the unit and found absolutely nothing wrong with it.  He then got the until going by reinstalling the wire that Lee's tech unhooked to disable it which all took about 20 minutes.

The Lee's employees name was Francisco and he flat out lied to me and disconnected my heater in an attempt to extort $1400 from me.  Merry Christmas from Lee's to me.<//Text>< Pics>

John did a wonderful job! He made sure that we understood everything about our service. He needed to go through our master closet to get to our attic. He put drapes on all my clothing and made sure that nothing got ruined. He even vacuumed up the carpet when he left to make sure it was left better than he found it. He told us about the membership but did not oversell to seem forceful. We will now be taking part in the membership and hope to have John come back and service our AC unit again.< /review>

<text>Lee's Air exceeded my expectations.  Recommended from a friend who just had their central air replaced with great results, I scheduled a maintenance for our AC with Lee's Air.

Arrived on time.  Allowed me to watch, learn, and understand.  Gave me helpful tips to perform in between regular maintenance.

Went above and beyond when helping me repair a broken duct vent at no extra charge.

If you can, request John A for your technician.  Super pleased!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Armando was very polite and explained their billing procedures. I liked him from the very start.   It became apparent to me that Lee's Air Conditioning is not really interested in small jobs.  This became apparent after Armando was required to tell me that my small job would be charged a very high fee.  I took this as a sign Lee's did not want small jobs.  After paying the $49 for his coming out I concluded that paid his time to see what the job entailed.  I had explained this when I made the appointment .  I would rather have been told "We are an industrial firm and your job is too small for our plan."  I then called another firm, they had no fee to come out and did the work for less than half of what Lee's wanted.  I want to make clear that Lee's did work for a relative of mine and I was there and had a chance to interact with their three workers.  It was a big job and they did a great job.  Since they are for industrial jobs I should have been informed by telephone while making the appointment that my job didn't meet their expectations.  Kudos to Armando who was unwittingly faced with breaking the bad news to me.  Kudos to me for paying the  $49 without protest.  Best wishes, Lee's.</Text>

We bought a house a few months ago and found in the recent rain storms that the back yard flooded. Turns out the underground gutter drains were clogged and not draining so the water was backing up into the back yard. Since we had no idea where the underground pipes went or where the clog was we hired Lee's to run a fiber optic cable down the pipes to map out the structure and identify the blockages.

Lee's sent out Ebert Bissett to do the work. Ebert was just outstanding. He knew exactly how the underground drain systems worked and in two hours mapped out the entire system and identified where it was blocked. He also found no less than 6 surface grates for draining surface water that were completely buried and non-functional. He was very good at using the fiber optic snake camera which are harder to use with the corrugated plastic yard drain pipes as it is hard to get around corners and branches in the system.

Ebert Bissett was just excellent at his job and as a person. I  highly recommend Lee's, and especially Ebert Bisset!<//Text>

My service appointment was originally scheduled December 4th. I had to push it out a week, and it was done without issue. I received a text message, and email, letting me know that the tech (San) was on his way. San arrived well within the schedule window and got right to work. He performed the yearly ‘tune-up’ on our heater, and checked operation thoroughly. We had open dialogue regarding the system, and he shared some valuable tips regarding care and maintenance of the system. He was professional in his approach, and spent the time needed to complete the job and answer questions I had regarding the system. The cost for the yearly tune-up is extremely fair and negated by the piece of mind you get knowing that your system is at its best and ready to meet your needs. In every case, the Lee’s representative sent to our home has more than exceeded our expectations as consumers. I recommend them without reservation and will continue to do so. They are my first, and only, choice for my HVAC needs.< /Review>

John called to say he was coming out. Very thorough at explaining things. Nice company. First time I used them and I was very happy. I did leave some notes with the phone gal and she forgot to tell them not to change filters as they were changed three weeks ago. He had started to change them but they were retrieved.</Text>

When our original HVAC unit died, Lee's came to the rescue.  We had a new unit installed along with duct work repair.  WOW!  What a difference in cooling & heating!  The unit is quiet, powerful, and energy efficient.  Lower PG&E bills are nice.  All employees are so kind, professional, thorough, caring, and knowledgeable.  Most importantly, they are responsive and excellent at communicating.  I highly recommend this company for A/C, Heating, and Plumbing.  :)<//Text>

John, Tyler, and Alex from Lee's Air was absolutely fantastic. I loved that John called me letting me know.if was 15 minutes away. He showed up and couldn't have been friendlier. He stayed and looked at our AC for almost 2 hours and talked to us along the way about what the problems were. When we decided it would be best to buy a new unit, John had someone at our house within 20 minutes to talk options. Alex and Tyler showed up a few days later to install the new unit. They were also both very professional. They were very thorough and kept us updated the whole time. The did a fantastic job! Love this company!< /Text>

Lee's Air Conditioning Company is truly the best.  We called for an appointment and they were out the next day.  Jose B came on time (which is so unusual these days with most companies)!!  He was the greatest.....was very thorough and helpful in helping us resolve the problem and all concerns we had.  He offered us some great advice, along with some helpful recommendations. He was an extremely friendly guy and so easy to talk to. Wouldn't ever recommend ANY other company then Lee's.  They truly provide the friendliest and best customer service any company could ever offer.< /text>

Kudos to Lee's for hiring such wonderful staff.  Ebert was an excellent representative and did a very professional job with assessing the plumbing problem, writing the estimate of costs and completing the job. In addition, he is a really nice guy!

I was having a plumbing issue due to all the grease that built up, and now my kitchen sink drain smoothly. Everything is donesuper professional from the estimate until the job is done. I did my shopping getting some quotes from the locals but they gave me the cheapest price.

Jesse is the staff who came, he is very friendly and honest. I leave him to work and he did a good job on time and everything. This company does not rip people off. Thanks Google.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I called several plumbers when my kitchen sink was leaking water all over the floor. No one could come out until next week. When I called Lee's Air, the dispatcher was very sweet and  sent someone within a few hours. I got a courtesy text beforehand with the plumbers name, photo and ETA… Can I tell you how much I LOVE THIS FEATURE!!! Ebert was the best. He was easy to have in my home, explained everything and I didn’t feel like he was going to charge me an outrageous amount of money for plumbing issues that didn’t exist. (This happens to me). You have my trust and I’m a customer for life!</Review>< pictures>

The service is top notch! I called on Saturday early evening because my air conditioner stopped working, and they were at my home Sunday morning. Ernesto was so professional and very knowledgeable. He explained everything and was honest and genuine. My air conditioner is working wonderfully and even better than before it went out. This is now the company my family and I will use for all of our regular maintenance needs from now on.< /text>

<Text>I had my spring maintenance by Adam  from Lee's Air Conditioning.  Adam  is very personable. He's very thorough in his inspection of our A/C unit. They come out in the spring and fall to inspect our heating & A/C. It's really comforting  to know that they will be coming out to make sure the equipment is A-OK.  I really like this company and every employee who has come over here. . They are the best.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1564261137589, 'text': 'Thank you Susan!

He discovered the problem was a clogged line, and fixed it in no time. Fees were very reasonable. I live in an older  home, too.

<text>Both gentlemen were on time, were professional, and very accommodating. Good sense of humor and gentle with my dogs. Their knowledge of the air conditioner and heating unit allowed them to explain what they found, both good and bad, in language I could understand. We talked about replacing the unit and the cost. They told me that the matter could be best handled by office staff as they had the knowledge and expertise in this area. Overall, this is yet another example of the service I’ve come to expect from Lee’s Air.<//text><name>James Horn< /name>< Date>

We had nothing but excellent, friendly, professional service from Chad!  Additionally, Lacey, Mary, and Celeste (I'm pretty sure.  Please forgive me, Celeste, if I got your name wrong!) were absolutely wonderful in their customer service on the phone.  We have loved having Lee's Air as our HVAC maintenance company since 2003, and look forward to many more years as the recipients of their flawless care! Many, many thanks, folks!<//Review>

Good, professional service.  The condenser fan motor failed during the height of summer season.  A friendly technician showed up on time, promptly completed the repair.  That is the good news.  But the cost of service seems to be on the high side.  Fan motor and capacitor  cost around $170 in Amazon.  The service cost though $573.  Yahoo search shows the average cost for motor replacement $ 250 to $450.< /Text>

Pete was outstanding. great guy, very friendly and he had the problem diagnosed and fixed in about an hour. He explained everything very thoroughly.

I can't say enough good things about our experience with Lee's Air. Every interaction with anyone from Lee's has been friendly, courteous and respectful. From the first call, I was impressed with their professionalism and customer service. Our air had been out for about a week (in the middle of a heat wave, of course) and I had been dealing with a few other companies trying to get the issue resolved. When I called Lee's, they said they couldn't come out until the next day; however, they called me back within minutes to say they were going to squeeze us in same day due to our circumstances. Everything was explained to us thoughtfully and thoroughly, including the how and why things weren't working, which allowed us to feel confident that we were making an educated decision in our best interest. Our Service Pro, Kevin, and his teammate, Severo, were amazing. They took such care with their work, and I appreciated that they cared about the quality of the installation as if they were working on their own home. Every question was answered with a smile, and I was constantly kept updated about the progress of the installation. I own a business, and I know this level of excellence is never on accident; you can only provide this level of customer service with intentional effort company-wide. I appreciate Lee's commitment to providing exceptional service from start to finish! Final note: Our AC unit has been defective since we bought our home so we've dealt with an absurd number of companies and technicians over the last eight years. Learn from our experience and just go with Lee's from the start. You won't regret it!< /Text>

I have been a homeowner at this property for 22 years.  The service person from Lee's was professional, thorough and very service oriented.   Mark was very detailed and took the time to describe and discuss items of concern relative to the air conditioning system.   He well exceeded my expectations.  I cannot more highly recommend a service person relative to heating, air conditioning and plumbing than Lee's Air Conditioning, Heating and Building Performance and more particularly, Mark.<//Review>

< review>
I called Lee's Air Conditioning on Friday to replace a kitchen sink faucet and was given an appointment on Saturday at 5-7 pm. Ebert (my service tech) called me at 11:30 am Saturday saying he was ahead of schedule and would I like him to show up now. He was at my door within 1/2 hour and in less than an hour he not only replaced my faucet but he also changed out the plumbing lines under the sink. We have a old house and everything under the sink was copper, which makes it really difficult especially when everything sold now has rubberized tubing.  Ebert did a wonderful job and I am very happy with his service. Will definitely use this company and Ebert again!!<//review>

<review>I scheduled my appointment for a ‘tune-up’ of the AC unit of my HVAC system. Tommy scheduled the appointment based on my request. I received reminder notifications for my appointment the day before the appointment. I received a notification that the tech was on his way the morning of the appointment. Further, I received a call from the tech, Francisco Ramos, letting me know he was on his way and when to expect him. He arrived on time, and got right to work after introductions and a few questions. He answered some questions that I had and was very methodical and thorough about finishing the task at hand. When he was done, he cleaned the work area, documented the work he had done, and summarized it for me verbally. In addition, he suggested the addition of an enhancement to the system that might prolong the life of the compressor. All of this defines OUTSTANDING customer service! I thank Francisco and Lee’s Air for always making me feel like a valued customer. I will continue to recommend Lee’s Air to those that have plumbing and HVAC needs. Lee’s Air is my company of choice for my HVAC needs.

Thanks again,

Jim</review>< pictures>

Lees air has always been a delight to use. Their staff is easy to work with, friendly, respectful of my home, my family. And pets, each person is highly trained in their field of work. I feel safe as they warentee their work so there is never any worry. They give a fair price and complete the job with out any trouble.  I call them the ghost team for when they leave They clean up after a project, leaving everything cleaner Than when they came. They treat each other like family and as a customer you are welcomed like family.

If you want a worry free done right the first time company then hire Lees.  They are a one stop shop-plumbing, air, electrical, insulation, duct work, solar, and they may even have a few more that I haven't listed. I referred them to all of my family.  It is with any reservation that I give my recommendation!</text>

<review>Service was above and beyond.  The guy was literally thinking of everything he could do to make sure everything was running smoothly, including replacing the batteries in the thermostat.  He explained everything he was doing, what he did and how it went, and made suggestions for keeping the system running smoothly.  I've had good experiences with Lee's air both times I've dealt with them (last year when our AC unit stopped working and this time on the follow up & maintenance check).  Highly recommended!<//review><date>1473371967173</date>< Response>

Alfredo was awesome. During a checkup, he found that our capacitor was almost dead. Then he found that the balancing damper was turned on making our bedroom hot. Crazy, we never knew anything about that. We have had two other companies tell us that we need to close other vents in the house to get the air back there. The other one asked me to review the ducts in the attic. Alfredo did nothing of the sort. He was very professional and listened to our concerns. He even gave me a choice in replacing the capacitor. He could pay their charge or get it and install it myself. He helped me pick the correct one from Amazon. We will definitely keep his card and call them foe all future repairs and checkups.</Text>

Lee's just came out to fix our dryer and get it hooked up properly. Service was great and very professional! The technician was on time and prepared with all that was needed, no extra trips to the hardware store. He was very friendly and efficient. Get the job done, double check and go. No wasting time which is just the why I like it. And the cost was very fair and affordable. I will definitely use Lee's again.</Review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>Ebert was amazing. My husband and I discovered a small amount of water damage in our ceiling below our master bath. Being that we had a newer home this was a little disturbing. From the start I called Lee's Air on a holiday non the less and they immediately set up an appointment. Ebert arrived promptly within the window given to us. I explained the issues and showed him the damage. He checked all options including the air conditioning unit before asking permission to cut into the ceiling. He made three small holes and was able to locate a tiny leak. He explained that it was most likely the shower pan and being that we had a tile shower it would have to ripped up. He advised me to call our builders to see if this type of damage was still under warranty. I was able to locate a contractor in town who could be at the house within 20 minutes. Ebert told me that he would stay and show the contractor the issues he located. He went above and beyond his duties. He could have left prior to the contractors arrival and left me to explain what was found. He didn't. He even had a card for someone that could complete the project if this had not fallen under warranty. If and when we have another issue outside of warranty... we will be calling and requesting the "Monterey Kid". Thanks for the professionalism and amazing service.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< Name>

I'm thankful for Lee's for there fast service and  getting me up and running with hot water again. I called other companies and they said they could help with the problem the next day....... I called Lee's and they came out within 2 hours and  fixed  my hot water problem. The representative Jermery was very efficient and  knowledgeable of his service he provide for Lee's company.

We had what appeared to be a very minor leak in our yard, but it was continuously leaking. This started just a few days earlier, and after eliminating that it was a sprinkler issue, we called Lee's Air Conditioning. Jesse arrived as scheduled (the same day we called!!). Jesse went to work digging and suctioning of water and then digging and suctioning off water until he located the hairline crack in our main water line (coming from the street to the house). He did the most beautiful, sturdy, secure patch job that I have ever seen as well as provided lots of helpful plumbing advice. We have no more leak!!! And I am certain that the job that Jesse did is so secure that it will never experience such a leak again.</Review>

Old AC quit working when it was 106.  Lee's did work on AC and indicated that is was 25 years old.  We decided to replace everything; AC, heater, ducts.  Three times the air flow, AC holds a constant temperature without running constantly.  We are VERY HAPPY!  Good crew of guys who did the work.  They took care of EVERYTHING!</Text>

<Text>I have used them twice, once for a water heater repair and once for a plumbing issue under our kitchen sink. Both times I have been extremely satisfied with their work.

I would HIGHLY recommend this company for your repairs. Thank you!</Text>< pictures>

I installed my own tankless water heater and couldn't get it working right. They had me call their tech and he tried to talk me through it free of charge. I had him come out and he reset my and everything works great! The tech was certified and very knowledgeable, gave me maintainence tips to keep my unit running smooth. Would definitely call them again!< /review>

Ernesto with Lee's Air came out to do a preventative maintenance inspection on our A/C before our 100+ degree days start. The customer service Ernesto provided was really above and beyond. He really knows his stuff when it came to our system and explained everything in a way that was easy to understand. If he needed to change a part, or service the unit, he tells you exactly what the part does --or why servicing is required, what it should do, and why it's not doing what it's supposed to. I never had to take his word for why something needed to be done. His work has earned Lee's Air our continuing patronage. Thank you!</review>

Just wanted to reach out and say thanks to Jessie M for fixing the piping in my home. He was able to diagnosed the issue, communicate all concerns, and provide a price to me in a timely manner. Although there was an error in the works, Jessie quickly corrected the error. I greatly appreciate hard workers such as Jessie and will remain a loyal customer due to the loyal employee and service that I have received from Jessie. I look forward to working with Jessie and Lees Air in the near future.<//Text>

Alfredo Ramirez was my service representative. He was very professional and knowledgable . He provided a diagnostic evaluation that was correct and made the repairs in a timely manner. He has a great personality and makes you feel at ease. He explains things throughly and makes sure you understand what is going on and what the cost is going to be. I am very pleased with the service I received and I will gladly recommend Lees Air and Alfredo Ramirez.</review>

<review>Lee's Air is honest, friendly, helpful, and reliable. I chose Lee's Air to do my A/C unit because they weren't trying to pressure me to change my A/C unit like other A/C companies tried to do. Lee's Air wanted to first check my A/C unit before making any determinations or suggestions. Other A/C companies didn't do that. They just wanted to change my A/C unit since they were obviously going to make more profit by doing this than to just make repairs. Lee's Air didn't do that and that's why I decided to have them do the work. Also they honored the original quote that was given to me by their HVAC Tech. That really convinced me that they were honest, helpful, and determined. I would recommend Lee's Air to anyone that needs HVAC work done.< /review>< response>

<review>The men were very professional, clean uniforms, very knowledgeable. They explained  each step in the process and how long each would take. I had to leave for a Dr’s appointment and asked them to lock the front door on their way out. Very responsible young men. They showed up around 7AM and were finished by the time I got home at noon. The new HVAC (heater/air conditioner) unit was up and functioning. They also installed new thermostat unit on the wall, pressure tested the ducting, and checked for corrosion up in the attic.

After our 20 year old AC died this summer we had 3 companies quote a replacement system. We evaluated each not just on cost but on reputation, and their willingness to “make it right” if we weren’t happy with the results. LeesAir was in the middle on price but what sealed the deal was their guarantee to make it right.

Jarrod worked with us to ensure we got the right system and improvements to make our house more comfortable. Once the quote was accepted installation happens quickly and without a hitch. The team who installed our system worked during the hottest time of the year and we really appreciate their hard work!

We are extremely happy with our new AC/furnace and the improvements LeesAir made to the overall comfort of our house through some ductwork modifications.  LeesAir got it right the first time and we feel we made the right choice.< /text>

Excellent!  I took advantage of Lee's Free Fall Plumbing last inspection last week, and this was my second appointment with Lee's.  They were so great to work with last summer in fixing my AC problems, I bought their Sprng-Fall Tune up. Ben was very professional and thorough during the plumbing inspection.  I wonder if they clone their employees... everyone is so pleasant from the first phone to Lee's to their visits for repairs.  I am a Realtor and will recommend Lee's Air to all my friends, and clients!  Thank you Lee's Air!</review>

<Review>Everyone was super helpful, from speaking to Sarah on the phone to Ebert coming over to drain our water heater.
Because we have some pretty old, faulty pipes we ended up having some more issues after the water heater was cleaned. Ebert came back over later in the evening (at 9pm) to make sure all our faucets were running properly. He could've charged us quite a bit for all of this work (over an hour) being that it wasn't a part of the water heater cleaning and was a result of our poor piping. I was really blown away by his kindness and his efforts to get the job done properly.
I would highly recommend these guys. Top notch.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1484586338997, 'text': 'Zach, thank you so much for taking the time to leave our team such a wonderful review! It has been our pleasure working with you!'}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Lee's Air Conditioning has the best service in town. They have emergency service and also excellent check up service. We had the install an new air conditioner and furnace last September, they were knowledgeable, took care of rebates and explained everything. The men were clean during installation and put everything back in order. They just came for a checkup and again the service was excellent.</text>

<text>I called them last year for a heating issue because of the stellar reviews they had. They were professional in handling the call, setting the appointment. They treated me with respect, and respected my home. However, they misdiagnosed the problem and charged the $100 service fee. They insisted that I needed a new unit and rushed to suggest an appointment with their sales guy. I believe this company pushes sales too hard because that's what they make most of their money on. During the summer, the same issue that occurred with the heating occurred with the AC. That led me to believe that they had misdiagnosed the problem. My home warranty company sent a local contractor who diagnosed the problem to be purely electric. Heating is working as expected. Lee's Air did not earn my trust due to a problem that was misdiagnosed that could have cost me $10,000 (the cost of a new unit).<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Alfred has serviced my equipment several times now.  He remembers me from previous conversations which I believe is a sign of outstanding customer service.  The service performed was routine maintenance and performed with the highest degree of professionalism and in a timely manner.  I highly recommend Lee's and Alfred in particular.

LATE  POST: We were needing emergency service on a Saturday with a heat wave in progress.  Ernesto M. showed up on time as promised and immediately went to diagnosing the problem with our AC unit.  He took roughly 5 minutes to tell us the issue and what our options would be to repair.  We agreed on what course to take and he had the unit fixed and up and running in less than an hour tops.  We were extremely happy with the customer service all around and will definitely call Lee's Air in the future.< /review>

<text>I saw that this company had really good reviews, so I was hopeful that that meant they also had good customer service and would answer an email, because I don't like calling people. And they did answer my email. And also have text servicing as well. Which was awesome. So I made an appt to have my AC checked on since my electric bill increased too much in a month period, and they sent someone out on monday. They gave me a two hour window, he showed up an hour into it. Did a full AC check up, found some issues, fixed them, and was out. Hoping to see that the work that was done makes a difference on My bill next month. Definitely would recommend this company though, especially if you are hearing impaired/Deaf and prefer to email / text.< /text>< pics>

<review>I just wanted to put in a good note for Lee's Air.  We had lost heat and needed repair.  I looked on the web for a company that had great reviews and had an A+ crediting rating with no complaints.  I found Lee's and called them.  I spoke to a gal named Amanda (I believe) and she was polite and helpful.  She was able to get a tech out the same day.

Allen (Tech) was awesome from the get go and was able to diagnose an old outdated system. He was quick, courteous and professional. He was able to give me a reasonable estimate and fix our problem right away. Within the time frame expected, we had heat. Signed invoice, shook hands and off he went for his next service!

One thing I liked about Allen, is that he was different from the rest. I've had other service people try to upsell and get you to spend more than you should, but Allen was not like that. He is the type of person that you want in your home. He cares about people and not payment!  I am extremely happy!

Thank you,  Lee's Air and Allen for the great work!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Cannot think of anything Alfredo could have done better, but there is always room for improvement! He showed up on time and wore boot covers. Was friendly and down to earth. Moved quickly through the service inside the home and quietly when on the roof. At the end had me sign and offered a more convenient option for the service the next time around. Thanks Alfredo!</Review>

He was very friendly and helpful and we decided it was time to purchase a new AC unit, new heater and some duct work. Early on Friday, Pedro and Kody showed up, they even called us when they were on their way. They were very polite and professional, they explained what they needed to do and immediately got to work. They worked hard for almost 10 hours determined to get it done so we could have AC that night. They took great care and went the extra mile as far as customer service goes. They wore booties so they didn't get the carpet dirty, they even vacuumed when they were done. Our AC works great and it's all thanks to the team down at Lee's.<//Text><GmapID>0x80946f511471f3a9:0x7ee5494a56bea370</GmapID><response>{'time': 1505143482058, 'text': 'Thank you Jared for taking a moment to share your experience with us!

<Text>I expected the $99 service call but was very surprised with the price.  I was informed that the service call would be $99.  When Tim found the power to the unit had tripped because of a loose bolt which took 15 minutes to diagnose and repair with no parts needed he gave me a bill for $258.00.  That seems  excessive.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

It is our intention on every service we perform to provide a valuable solution at a reasonable price. In our market research, we have found this price to be about the same as other similar local companies. The flat rate cost of the repair includes the part, the labor to install it, testing and operating the system to verify proper function of all other components once installed, the benefit of having it completed immediately and properly by a certified specialist upon approval, the support of a company that's been trusted in the valley for over 35 years, and other costs associated with running a small business in the state of California.\nAll that being said, in addition to the part and labor warranty we honor, we also hold fast to our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.

Mark showed up on time and told me what he would be doing for my service.  He put fresh paper booties on each time he had to go outside and come back into my home. Mark was very professional and explained what he found while servicing my A.C. He explained the benefits of signing a twice a year contract when I enquired about it, but did not pressure me to enroll. I
I have used several different companies to service my heating and AC units over the years, but I will be sticking with Lee's from now on.<//Text>

Lee's Air has done my air conditioner maintenance for years. The service reps have always been courteous, helpful and professional. They even put little sock booties over their shoes before they come into the house so as to not make any dirt spots. Lee's air has recently opened a plumbing division. I had their plumber install a new faucet for me as the old one was leaking and needed a professional to remove it because it was in so tight my husband couldn't do it. Jesse M. at Lee's fixed my faucet perfectly, and and the price was reasonable as well. It was well worth it and a positive experience for me.< /Text>

Excellent service. Freddy did a complete review of my system and then provided straight forward advice on what to do with my situation. Covered all the options and provided me with information on what he would do. I couldn't ask for a better experience. If you are wondering if Lee's Air is a reputable company then stop researching and give them a call. If all their techs are as good as Freddy you will not be disappointed with this company.<//Review>

We had an appointment for a check up on 7/17. The office called to say there was a cancellation and we could be seen today. This worked out great and Mark showed up promptly and was professional and friendly. He changed the filters and cleaned the coils along with an inspection. This is the first time using Lee's air, but now will be a regular customer.<//Text>

<review>Ernesto was amazing. I was especially impressed with all of the time he took explaining the problem my heater was experiencing, and all of the options for correcting the problem. He also took the time to explain exactly how my system works, how to maintain it, and how to save money doing it. I have never had any service provider take that kind of time with me. He was very articulate, obviously knowledgeable, and a gifted explainer of how things work. Thank you, Ernesto. You do very good work!<//review>< pictures>

I would love to be able to leave specific reviews about Ernesto, Raoul, and Frank.  I have lived in Clovis for 19 years and I have never had the experience of working with such competent, accommodating, and polite technicians.  Each of them performed their part of the process with friendly professionalism and answers to every question posed.  Each one was here at the time range that was set.
Ernesto took pictures of the unit to show us the problem.  He even provided the background so that I knew it was my air conditioner.  Ernesto gave me all the information and all the options I had to choose from.  He explained the process for each option.  Because of his deep bank of knowledge, he was able to build rapport, confidence, and the ability to make a comfortable decision.  He was without exception - EXCELLENT!

Based on Ernesto's recommendation, Raoul delivered a temporary room air condition to give us some relief with sleeping.  He was polite, complementary about the Company, understood exactly what was required to set up the room air conditioner.  He was able to answer all the questions that were asked.  After Frank left, he recommended that another temporary unit be delivered.  It was 109 that day and within hours, Raoul was out again to deliver another unit.  I could tell he was hot from perspiration on his face and in his shirt.  But he showed no sign of frustration - he stated that the company priority was to make the customer happy and comfortable.  For the first time, I thought maybe we would be able to stay in our home and not in a hotel.  I wish I could award Raoul 10 stars out of a scale of 5!

Frank came next.  He was able to use metaphors to increase the understanding of the air conditioner situation.  Within the time he was here, he was able to explain exactly why the unit was not repairable and what caused this condition.  I understand what we need to do with this unit to extend its life.  He was able to explain our role in the air conditioner's demise without making you feel incompetent.  His knowledge was extremely broad and he was able to provide relevant information before we thought of the questions.  As he left we had a peace of mind that we were making the right decision.

No one likes to spend $ 8 - 12,000 on a new A/C, but to do it with confidence of the integrity of the company and its employees makes it a lot less painful!  He was also able to explain the PG&E rebate program rebate and how to interface with that.  I would recommend Ernesto and his colleagues in any situation.<//text>

Wow! This company is wonderful! Needed plumbing on a Sunday and within 2 hours Ebert B. was at our house to save the day! Very professional, great service and explained everything to us to make sure we knew exactly what was going on. Went above and beyond. In fact, we needed to replace our AC unit sometime this year and Aaron was able to come out the same day (Sunday) within one hour to inspect it. Needless to say, we got our plumbing repaired and a new AC unit today. I am beyond impressed with this company and will recommend them to anyone!<//review>

From the moment Kevin began his service at our home, he was friendly, professional, courteous and made sure that we understood everything that he was going to be working on. (He replaced air ducts in our attic and balanced the air flow to three bedrooms. He also added two lag screws to the air conditioning condenser on the patio roof.) He showed me before and after pictures of the project from his iPad. When finished, he vacuumed, changed the filters, and left everything tidy and clean.  It was a pleasure to have him in our home.</text>

Just had Lee's Air complete a 2nd job for me.  This time at my place of business.  How nice to work with a company that does what they say they are going to do!  Prompt, professional and competitive!  My landlord had several questions about the job and the owner of Lee's (Tom Howard) personally took the time to meet with him and answer all of his questions.  Thanks for going the extra mile!  Two thumbs up!<//Review>

Jesse M was extraordinarily helpful in solving the leaky gate valve problem. He arrived LONG before his Expected window which meant the work got started finished and my day of errands wasn't interrupted with waiting. Splendid!. It cost more than I was thinking of spending... HOWEVER,  I recognize things, wages and cost of running businesses have gone up, so I  think I  was fairly charged for the expertise I required.  Thanks Lee's Air and Jesse M.< /Review>

Technician was very professional.  He had to walk through the house to get to the attic and put 'booties' over his shoes.  It was much appreciated on my light carpet. He fully explained everything to my husband and I.<//text>

<review>Our AC went out on a weekend with 104 degree heat. I used the email feature on Lee's Air website to contact them for service asap. This email was sent at about 2:30am. I received a phone call from their on-call person within 6 hours. On a Sunday morning. The tech was at our house 2 hours later. Unfortunately, the problem required a part they didn't have on hand so I had to wait until Monday for repairs. The repair was timely and worked well. They also gave me a discount for being a member of Club Advantage. Thanks, we're cool again!</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

My AC quit working and I was frantic to find a repair service in my area. I called Lee's AC based on the reviews I read here. I have to agree with everyone else...Deanna was wonderful and very helpful.  She even emailed me a photo and bio of the technician so I would know who was coming to my door.  Pete the technician was also excellent! He assessed the problem and fixed the AC. He was very polite and courteous. Although my pocket book wasn't too happy with the $500 expense, the customer service was priceless. With this kind of service, I will definitely use them again as well as recommend this company to my friends and family!</Text>

After several months of researching local Ac Company’s and getting 4 different quotes to replace two full AC/heating systems I chose Lees Air. President Tom Howard personally addressed my needs and concerns.  My Installation Specialist were Andy M and Servero R. They were very professional, knowable and respectful of my home.  I would highly recommend them.< /review>

<review>Mark M came out for maintenance of unit. Mark was very professional and remembered to put shoe covers on before entering the house. He took the time to show me how to and when filter should be changed also the importance of doing this. He told me where I could purchase the filters and showed me how one would look. He explained additional Lee's maintenance contract which provided services you would end up paying more for but provided from them at a very low yearly cost (great deal, I bought it).  When Mark left I felt competent to do my part in keeping my unit running well and releaved at knowing Lee's would be there for me when and if needed. I give this company two thumbs way up!!<//review><GmapID>0x80946f511471f3a9:0x7ee5494a56bea370<//GmapID><Resp>{'time': 1594246765023, 'text': "Thank you for this excellent review!

<Review>We just bought a new air conditioning unit for our house through Lee's Air.  We couldn't have been happier with the service and product we received.  Originally we were working with another company , because they were contracted through our home warranty company.  Three weeks and multiple mix-ups later, we were still without air conditioning. On a desperate whim we called Lee's Air.  The company sent someone out within two hours to assess our situation.  When we learned it would be more cost effective to replace the unit rather than fix a unit that was at the end of its useful life, we agreed, but were concerned that ordering a new unit would leave us without Air conditioning for a longer period of time.  Lee's offered to loan us two mobile A/C units and had them delivered that very day!!   The delivery and installation was like clockwork.  The technicians were nice, professional and very informative.  I'd definitely recommend Lee's Air.  I was completely satisfied with my experience.< /Review><rating>5</rating><gmap_id>0x80946f511471f3a9:0x7ee5494a56bea370< /gmap_id>< Name>

<review>I had an emergency where the AC unit stopped blowing cold air. The tech came out, after hours, and was able to diagnose the issue fairly quickly and was able to fix the issue on site. It turned out to be a faulty/fried plug that had to be replaced. I signed up for their maintenance program and received a bit of a discount for doing so.

Allen explained everything very clearly and helped me to understand the issue.<//review><Date>1435467855150</Date>< rate>

<text>Wow! Out technician Nate Espinola was perfect!
Very professional, right on time, gave a courtesy call/text and was super honest the entire time.
If you can ask for a specific techniciation, ask for Nate.
On the customer service side, not sure who we talked to but would also give her a perfect score :)

They charged me $260 to change a 9 dollar capacitor.  I know there is a cost associated with running a business but a capacitor is a 10 minute fix and the first thing you check when troubleshooting an ac. They also didn't apply any of the diagnostic fee to the fix which is very common with a.c. companies.  They were on time and professional but really high on a simple repair.  I was out of town when my tenant a.c. went down or I would have order the capacitor on Amazon and saved $250.  Also I asked the repairman about how much a capacitor costs and he said he didn't know.  Either he is a bad a.c. guy who doesn't know how much basic parts costs or he lied about not knowing because he knew how much they were over charging me. Either way is no bueno.   I suggest you find a company that applies the $100 service call fee to the work they do.< /review>

You are right that there are costs associated with running a business, however, it is not our intention to charge more than the value we provide.

< Review>
Last Monday I called Lee’s Air because my A/C was making a horrible noise and started smoking.  A repair tech (Chad) came out the very next day, a sales rep  the day after and an install team by Monday.  Our installers Severo and Tyler were very professional and worked hard for two days to install my new A/C unit, furnace and duct work.  Kept a very courteous and professional attitude considering how hot it was in the attic and the amount of time they had to spend up there!  My A/C is working great and way more efficient than my 12 year old unit and in less than a week from beginning to end.  I would recommend Lee’s Air to anyone I know as well as Severo and Tyler!<//Review>

Jose was great.  He came out and looked over our (really old) AC unit and gave us some good information and his honest opinion without being pushy about trying to sell us a new one.  He was a much appreciated change from other techs we've had from different companies looking at it.< /text>

Prompt and professional service installing a new central air system on our house.  Andy and Jeff were both patient and helpful in answering questions and reviewing options.  Also, their prices were far better than their primary local competitor (ABC/Albritten).  Their price was about $1800 less for a comparable system and the same ducting repairs.  Thanks for the great work.< /review>

Jesse came sooner than later and was able to fix our leaky faucet and shower in no time. He was very professional and explained to me what the problem was and showed me the broken parts. I will definitely call on him again in the future and would highly recommend Lee's Air and plumbing to my family and friends!<//Text>< pictures>

I was pleased with the quality and speed of service. I am an Electrical Contractor and needed a specialist when my Air Conditioning failed at my home. Their office staff scheduled me far faster than their competition was able to. Their technician Pete was competent and knowledgeable. I heartily recommend this firm as a professional and home owner. Save your time and energy shopping around and schedule with Lee's Air when you have problems with your system.</Text>

Service was awesome and fast! Matt repaired and explained everything well. He didn't have the part necessary for the repair in his van, but he went to the store and got the job done. He was very professional and friendly. He was perfect for an emergency situation to get cool air running.

<text>For the past two summers our AC would run constantly, hitting 80 degrees inside when outside temps were in the high 90s or 100.  I finally called Lee's Air and Matt W. arrived right on time for an AC inspection.
He was extremely professional, courteous, and knowledgeable.  I was all set for bad news, i.e., new AC unit, but he recommended cleaning our air filters (!) and adding refrigerant to the unit.  Instead of paying thousands we paid less than $300, and this included a maintanance contract for a heating check in the fall and an AC check next spring.  He didn't even charge for the new air filters.
I can feel the house cooling down as I type.  It's also less humid.  The next few days are going to be 100+ but I say, bring it!  Thanks, Lee's Air!!

UPDATE:  7/7/17
I wish I could write a separate review (maybe I can, can't figure it out?) to give Jesse M. all props for his excellent work!  Had a couple of leaks to repair as per our home inspection.  Selling our house.  Jesse M. was timely, polite, and did an excellent job!  He tried to save us money on the initial inspection (how does this business STAY in business if they keep doing that? : )  but found he needed parts for the sink leak.  He came back the next morning at 9am (totally  on time) and fixed up the sink in half an hour.  Even fixed a condensation leak on the side of the house at no charge!  Lee's Air is the best!!  We're moving out of state but if we were staying in Cali I'd call them every time!  Thanks, Lee's Air!</text>< Pics>

<Date>1544984485529</Date><Review>No hot water for 3 weeks. Paid for a service tech a week to fix my tankless water heater but to no avail. The fourth time was a charm when Ed and I chose the techs at Lee's Air. Their service and technical knowledge was unsurpassed in comparison.  They even determined previous installation flaws that were not to code or repaired incorrectly.  On top of all that, my tankless was not even powerful enough to support the entire house that we purchased 2 months prior. Lee's assisted me in financing a new tankless water heater and discussed the game plan to get things started- & mind you, this is still the initial visit! The NEXT DAY, Lee's adjusted their schedule to install the new heater and they did an outstanding,  professional job. They even looked into my dinosaur HVAC unit and made suggestions for the future which I will undoubtedly make with the help of Lee's.  Excellent service and workmanship is not inexpensive,  it's an investment that needs to be backed by a great company.  Lee's Air comes highly recommended by this family.  Thank you!<//Review><username>Suzy Castaneda< /username>< Rating>

I had a new AC unit installed, Kevin M. And Alex C. Were the two servicemen who handled the difficult endeavor. I was very very satisfied with them both, the 2 of them worked amazing together, learned they were work partners for a while and it clearly showed. I mainly talked to Kevin, and he was super personable, he himself spent a solid 3 hours up in my attic in 108 degree heat connecting things (that alone deserves a medal). Both men worked very hard with no complaint, and basically made the experience very pleasant. They both clearly enjoy their job, even when it has parts they dont enjoy, and it shows in their hard work, but also how well they get along and can joke and have a good time while doing it. Would would definitely love to get Kevin and Alex every time I need my AC serviced!< /Review>

April 2019- had a plumbing problem. Called Lee's because they had great customer service from my previous experiance with the. Elbert B was representative sent out to my house. He was professional and solved my plumbing issue. He also provided me some great preventative advice that will be sure to help me out in the long run. He also provided quotes for additional plumbing services that he recommended for future. I appreciated that and did not feel pressured. Always a pleasure getting help from Lee's.

Always great service from the person who answers the phone to take my info to the technition that comes out. Everyone at Lee's is friendly and professional. I've had to use them twice one for my heater and once for my  air conditioning unit. Both times were a great experiance.< /Text>

Lee's Air is great! Knocked out my new AC unit and new ducting in 2 days in the middle of summer! The crew (Montrel, Kory, Leyland and Nieko) were super professional and helpful. They did a great job and even got my system down to only 3% loss. New unit is running smooth and keeping the house cool despite triple digit temps. I highly recommend Lee's Air. Great experience overall.< /Text>

Andy with Lee's Air is very professional and friendly.  He took time to answer my questions and explain the installation process to me.  He went above and beyond to make a small change on the installation of my ductless air conditioner.  I highly recommend Andy with Lee's Air and will hire them again on my next HVAC project.</review>

Freddy was very nice, informative and his appearance was very professional and neat.  He put down a cloth to not scratch our hardwood floors.  He informed us of what was going on with our air conditioner and what to keep an eye out for with our condenser for the future.  We also had a good experience 2 years ago when our thermostat went out on a hot Friday July afternoon and Lee was out within 2 hours, took care of it and we were able to go to an event we were hosting and be on time.  OMG that meant the world to us.  This is our second experience with Lee and we really enjoyed it.  Freddy made our day, and the next time we have have an update care on our air conditioning we really would like Freddy to come out again. Salo Stanley Fresno CA<//text>< pics>

<Review>Excellent service! I had an emergency plumbing sitautuon that happened around 9pm last week. I wasn't sure who to call but then I remembered Lee's air and heating also did plumbing too. So I called them and they immediately dispatched a plumber to my house. Jesse arrived and did a great job! He was very friendly, polite and professional. I have had nothing but superior service from Lee's and all of their techs that have serviced my house. I actually found them on yelp earlier this year when our heater went out. I am now a loyal customer to Lee's.

Hey Lee's I think Jesse deserves a raise! Anyone who can come out and snake a toilet that fast and still be friendly that late at night, deserves a raise in my book 😉 Lol. Thanks again Lee's!<//Review>< time>

Lee’s Air confirmed diagnosis that Central Air needed to be replaced.  I had  a 23 year old unit that was becoming unreliable.  It also used R22 refrigerant which is being phased out. Frank Sanchez gave me several options which included replacing both furnace and AC as well as an option to just replace the AC.  When compared with a competing bid Lee’s was the best price for a a very efficient unit.  All my questions were answered to my satisfaction and we made an appointment to install.  In The meantime Lee’s sent out a large capacity window unit free of charge.  During the bid and installation  process I had comminication with various company representatives all of whom were informative and courteous.  I never had to wait on the phone or made a call that went unanswered. From the time I placed my order until installation was only 4 days. The install took one day.  I highly recommend Lee’s.  The most important part Of choosing a new HVAC system is choosing the right contractor .< /Text>

<review>Mark was very thorough, he checked everything on my HVAC system, made a couple of repairs, discovered a leaking capacitor and replaced it. Then he cleaned the cooling fins on the AC housing.  I'm happy with the service he did.  He also offered me a 10% discount for being a longtime loyal customer and saved me a few bucks.  (The capacitor was extremely expensive, but as a customer I had no choice but to replace it, even at the high price.  This was not Mark's fault, he did a good job for me.)   I've done business with Lee's Air for some 15 years or more.<//review><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x80946f511471f3a9:0x7ee5494a56bea370< /gmap_id>< name>

<review>Although [ prominent Fresno-based AC company ] has serviced my AC units for years and done a commendable job, I recently felt things had gone a bit too far when they charged me over $450 for a $180 replacement motor. I know marking parts up is part of the game but, for some reason, this seemed a bit excessive... After reading some of the other positive reviews, I figured I'd give Lee's a shot. My first experience has been fantastic -- interacting with the office was straightforward -- they were courteous and professional. Best of all, the technician who serviced the unit was *very* conscientious -- he invested the time to thoroughly leak-test the unit and communicated clearly (I was out of state when this happened) regarding all of the issues. Contrast this with [ another prominent Fresno HVAC company ] which simply recommended replacing the unit... My first experience with Lee's and it's already obvious I will save hundreds of dollars due to the quality of the technician.< /review></record>

i was very impressed with their service especially on short notice.  It was 106 outside and my two year old AC unit wasn't providing cool air.  I knew it was going to be hard to get someone on short notice in this weather so I first started my hunt with the reviews as I always do.  I saw the reviews for Lee's and decided that this was a good place to start.  I went to their website where I noticed an online form to request service.  I was a bit skeptical in that I needed someone soon but I used it anyway since they were closed when the air first stopped working in the night. Amanda was on top that website request.  Within an hour of opening for the day she tried to call and also sent me an email to call her back. She was able to squeeze us in that day.  Matt contacted me 30 minutes before arriving to let me know he was running a little late.  I was very appreciative of that.  He was very attentive to my questions and showed me the readings on the meter explaining what part needed to be replaced.  He gave me his recommendation but yet offered other options as well to save money.  He had it running in minutes.  I asked a few questions about the air flow to certain rooms, he quickly checked the ducting and explained the long runs were being split reducing the air flow to those rooms.  He determined there were no dampers to control those in the attic and explained how to best adjust the registers in the other rooms to help.  He furthered explained the dampers and leveling out the air flows throughout the house.  I would not have known that this was available if he had not explained it so now we are thinking about doing that.  Great service from everyone.</Review>

<Response>{'time': 1439009999397, 'text': "Mr. Eaton,\nWe have a satisfaction guarantee and since you feel cheated, I would highly recommend calling our office and asking for a refund. We see your viewpoint and I don't think we did a good job of explaining what was being sold. We do not sell parts. Like you, we have to purchase the parts from a parts house or directly from the manufacturer.  We sell the service/labor of repairing the air conditioner, along with the part, prompt service, and a solid warranty to go with it. I would always recommend that people who are mechanically inclined, such as yourself, and that have the time to pull a motor from an ac unit and replace it should do so. Their skill is something they have earned and should use it if they are looking to save money.  The motors that we use cost more than an $87 motor; however, I understand where you are coming from because they are not $600.  Once we purchase the motor, put in several hours of labor at $115 per hour, mark up the motor, add a capacitor to avoid call back issues, and perform a final tune-up, it does come out to around 650 dollars.  Once all of our costs are paid, we usually make about 10% net profit on average.  We do not look to gouge customers but we look to be competitive in the marketplace for our customers and offer health benefits to our employees, retirement etc. so we can keep long-term, highly skilled, happy employees which produce the positive experiences that customers receive, and that you read about online before asking for our service.  I don't know if this helps but if you feel cheated, please call our office to receive a full refund."}</Response>< Text>
I called Lee's because of the positive reviews but what a major disappointment.  The fan motor was shot so they quoted $657 to repair.  I was shocked.  I paid the $99 diagnostic fee but purchased the fan motor for $87.  Yes, I said $87.  Im no AC guy but was able to complete the repair in 3 hours.  I have receipts to prove it.  They can spin it however they want, but the facts speak for themselves.  Beware.<//Text>

From the moment I spoke with Deana, to the consultation with Tom, to the incredible job Andy and crew did, you would be making a mistake to use anyone else. Installed within 2 days and in just a few short hours, they deliver what they promise and more.

Ben was friendly and clearly described what work needed to be done.  He came out the first time to fix (replace) a large leak in some old metal drain pipes (under the house) for our kitchen sink, on of Jan. 4th, 2017.  He explained our options thoroughly; since we also had old pipe under the sink that needed replacing as well, but it was left up to us.  Since he did such a good job the first time we were happy to see him come back out when we had another minor problem on Feb. 29th, 2017 and called Lee’s.  I would ask for him by name if I have any future pluming problems.< /review>

<Text>Great experience but why would Lee's Air want to force me to log into google or yahoo or whatever to just say Great Job guys! Why would they think that I need a google map showing how I should travel to get to their offices? They come to me I don't need to come to them. Sorry if I sound like a hardnose about this stuff but I am certainly not the only one that hates the internet and the complications it has added to my life.</Text><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>alfredo is absolutely fantastic. he took the time to go over everthing with me. explained everything so i was able to understand.  before i called lee's, the company i was with would come in and then the only thing they would go over with me was that they were done.  and days later would find out they forgot  to do things and that they missed some issues with my system.  i would not hesitate to refer alfredo to anyone and everyone.</Text></record>

We had a new HVAC system installed with ducking last year by Lee's.  There was some problems with the manufactory end of things, Lee's handled everything professionally and took care of us throughout the process.  This visit was for a regular servicing of the unit.  One of the outstanding team members, that we had meet during the install, Alfredo R, was the one who performed the service. When  I mentioned our low water pressure , he reminded me that under our service policy we had a free plumbing inspection.  I have scheduled that for next week, and know that we can depend on the same great service and trustworthy business practices for that.< /text>

<Text>Brandonn was very polite and very professional.  It took him about 2 minutes to ID the problem. It only took him a few minutes to fix the water leak.
I would recommend Lee's anytime.

Ernesto M. came out from Lee's Air to install my EcoBee 4 and do a general tuneup of my AC unit. We had purchased the house in March and had a home inspection done and thought pretty much everything was good with our AC other than missing the p trap. Ernesto installed the EcoBee with ease, he even has one at his home, which is nice to hear of that, instead of someone telling you the Nest is the best. He went on the roof and installed the power extender that came with the EcoBee (since we are missing the common wire), he took pictures of our HVAC, did a great cleaning on the unit, installed the p trap we were missing, and even found that the unit needed more sealant to the ventilation on the roof because our unit had pulled away from the vent and was leaking cold air outside. Overall I highly recommend him and he company! He did work with me on helping me to decide that I should go with their $168 tune up service (which includes the heater tune up) instead of a one time $99 service. The one thing I have to say is that the service center needs some work on maintaining accounts. I was called twice within five minutes by two different people asking me if I wanted to move my appointment date up a day, called them back and told them no, then less than two hours later someone called me about the same thing. A bit frustrating on that part, but I'm glad it didn't push me to change my mind about hiring that company to work on my unit.<//text>

I had a problem last Sunday the 13th and Pete came to my home and fixed my air conditioning . I was very impressed how fast he diagnosed the problem and made the repair. Your company is honest, reliable, and has much integrity and that is what I tell people when they ask for a air condition and heating company " CALL LEE'S ".</review>

<text>Called early in the morning for AC repair, an appointment was made for a tech to show between 3-5 that day, awesome right, well I get a call at 11:30am stating they had a "contracted" customer that needed service and they had to cancel. That's ok if they were still able to come out the same day after 5, which they could but I would have to pay the premium for the call because it would be considered "emergency" service. Why should a customer pay more because you guys over booked or decided your contract customer was more important than me? Unacceptable way to treat new customers.

Update 1: Amazing what happens when you express your concerns on social media. I got a call shortly after this post from Amanda and wow what a difference. Amanda was so appologetic about the situation and assured me that someone would be out to my house today, regardless of time and will not be charging me the premium service. Amanda was amazing, understanding and has definitely made a change for the better. I appreciate great customer service and although I respect companies making a dollar I appeeciate it more when it's not at the cost of customer service. Because of Amanda I am going to give Lee's a shot. I will post after the service has been provided to let you all know how it went.
THANK YOU AMANDA, DON'T EVER STOP BEING AWESOME!!!!

Update 2: Just got a call from the president of Lee's air, again very very apologetic and was understanding of how I felt. I am not looking for anything more than a repair on my AC unit and now this company is making me feel as if I am their ONLY customer. Maybe I should go through their customer service training, might do me some good. Most company's would be more inclined to accept the loss of a potential customer well I can tell you this company is not like that. If it's wrong let them know and someone will fix it. Absolutly amazing. Thank you.

Update 3: All I can say about Lee's and the people who work there is they are amazing. The above issue was corrected beyond what words can say. The little issue of charging for something that should not have been charged for was corrected beyond what was expected. I gaurentee to you if you have an issue with this company all you need to do is express your concerns and their family will make you feel like you are part of theirs. Every single person I have spoken to after the initial concern all knew about the issue, all appologized, and all asked what they could do to make the situation better. If you do not at least get this company into you house for a quote you are doing yourself a disservice. What an amazing company and what amazing customer service. There is a reason for their 5 star rating.<//text><gmap_id>0x80946f511471f3a9:0x7ee5494a56bea370<//gmap_id>< name>

< review>
Stop wasting your time researching, read this and then you'll know:

I had a 36 year old AC leaking coolant and was costing me $300+/mo to cool downstairs to 80 degrees while the upstairs (where my office is) was 90 degrees. It was all bad.

Used my home insurance to service the beat up AC unit since one day it just decided to blow hot air instead of cold. The HVAC company worked with the insurance to condemn the unit and cut me a check to get a new one. Figured since they helped me with the insurance part I'd use them to get my new HVAC system. Spent a month working with them to try to get them to just give me a quote... Just a quote. I've never had to work so hard to give a somebody money before... Well except the DMV.

Finally, I had enough, I looked up other HVAC in my area. Lee's Air came up and had a staggering amount of high reviews.  Honestly nobody else even came close. Called them up and next day they sent out somebody to go over everything with me. We walked around the house, I told them the problems. He gave me a quote pretty much right then and there. Rip out the old system, install a brand new unit to bring my house into this century as well as add insulation to my attic. I thought on it for a day or two doing some research, called it in that I wanted to go through with it. He came back next day for me to give my down payment. Along with signing up to do a PG&E Rebate program.

A few days later an inspector came out to my house to inspect everything before hand for the PG&E rebate. Came to find out I was losing 35-40% of what ever the system would put out due to my duct work. Panic. I didn't have the money to redo my ducts, it's not like they were easy access in my house setup they were all between the first and second floor. Would cost thousands to rip everything apart the floors and the ceiling to redo the ducts. I emailed them several times back and forth if there was anything we could do. I must have been a pest.

They had another person come out the next day or so to get measurements of my closet (where my furnace is). While he was trying to do his job I was chatting with him about how I was losing 35-40% of everything through the duct work. He looked rather shocked and asked if he could look at my vents and told me that they would see if they could seal up what they could while installing the unit. No charge. I was rather happy. Maybe that'd get me down to 25-30%.

The next week (after the forth of July weekend) they were at my house and taking out my old piece of $h!t. They weren't able to get it all done in one day (they warned me that could be the case) as they needed a custom part built.  That night sucked.... It was 98 or something that day but it wasn't Lee's or anybody's fault in any way. They got as far as they could, they took out everything, they installed a new air intake as my old one wasn't large enough. They sealed up my ducts with what they could reach. Hell, they even gave me a new register for my one that was falling out of my ceiling. All I gave them were Otter Pops to stay cool while they worked their butts off in my hot house.

Next day the arrived, and got the HVAC installed. They also installed smoke and CO2 detectors in every room. Funny story, the guy got them installed in every room in the house and then his co-worker turned on the heater (have to test it obviously). Of course, the first time the heater turns on it smells... Smokey. The house was very noisy for a little while after that. They guys left with everything installed and working just fine.

Couple days later the insulation guys came out (they were subcontracted, sorry don't remember the name of their company). They went up into the attic, early morning of course, and sprayed their stuff in it. I had like... 3-4 measly inches before and they were suppose to bring it up to 18. According to the measuring stick they put up there they brought it up to 20-21. Score.

I now am sitting in my office writing this review unable to be happier. It's a nice and cool 77 degrees. Oh yeah, did I mention I'm down to 11.8% loss?< /review>

<Time>1437685792182<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Disclaimer: I do not work for Lee’s Air nor did they pay me for this review.

Our A/C went out the week that it hit a 109 degrees in the Central Valley. Luckily for us, we had been soliciting quotes for HVAC systems from various PG&E approved contractors. We met with four different companies and Lee’s Air made an impression right from the beginning.

Aaron Husak was our sales representative. He did not just walk in like the other contractor’s representatives had- he stopped to put on shoe covers before entering our home and appliances below our attic entrance were covered with a drop cloth. Our home was treated with respect. Aaron spent two and a half hours assessing our home as well as our needs- what temperature did we set the AC at? What were our bills like? How big was the house?  We felt like our home had been thoroughly inspected and the recommendation, when it came, was made with full knowledge of precisely what we needed and not what Lee’s wanted to sell us so they could make a profit. We had terms such as SEER and EER explained to us, and explained well without a hint of condescension so we went in with full knowledge of what we were getting.

Here is the kicker- of the four contractors we spoke with, Lee’s came back with the highest quote (but gave us a discount for ease of access to the attic) and we still went with them. This is coming from someone who really hates to spend money, but even we could see that going with Lee’s would mean that we would get full value for our money. Lee’s warranty was unbeatable and the interaction with their representatives so far had been fantastic.

When our AC did go out, Lee’s was on the job right away- Aaron came over and set up a portable AC for us so we wouldn’t bake in the 109 degree heat.  We have a child, a dog, and three cats and so this portable AC was a godsend. We fully expected Lee’s to say they would come only on the Monday after July 4th, and this is what the original installation date was, but they managed to push through and start work early. The installation team started work on July 3rd and finished on the afternoon of the 4th. Yes, they worked on getting the AC working for us on July 4th! Who does that? Lee’s apparently.

One of the installation technicians made an error which left the AC running continuously but Lee’s sent out another technician the evening of July 4th within an hour of our calling. David worked for two hours in the attic fixing the error and ensuring that everything else was working well. The cost- nothing, no overtime, even on July 4th.

We have never experienced service of this kind before and are very happy with our decision to go with Lee’s. Everyone at Lee’s comported themselves professionally.  All permit paperwork and inspections by the city were handled by Lee- all we had to do was be home to let them in. The work is done and I am sitting in a cool living room as I write this. I also just got a call from someone who wants to deliver a gourmet basket on behalf of Lee’s.

We are so impressed with Lee’s services (if the above paragraphs didn’t already make that obvious) that when it comes time to make major plumbing changes in our home we will be going with Lee’s. Go with Lee’s, you won’t regret it- they are worth every cent.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>
