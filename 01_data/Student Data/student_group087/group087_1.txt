French Miso Cafe, was by far the best food my girlfriend and I had during our week in Palm Springs.

It’s an intimate place with extremely fresh and well made food. Everything was made to order and so well balanced. I wish I could visit PS again just for this quaint dinning experience. Not only was the food amazing but the owners were beyond kind and the staff were very welcoming and attentive.

I highly recommend the Eggs Benedict, omelet, soups, croissants, and coffee. Anything made in this kitchen is sure to be cooked perfect and with great care for the ingredients used.

Thank you French Miso Cafe!< /Text>

That staff is super attentive and the owner is so sweet. No wonder this place has the highest rating in Palm Springs.

And on top of it all the courtyard is quaint. I kind of don’t wanna leave - might just spent my day with my bottle of champagne.</Review>< pics>

Absolutely wonderful.  Beautiful quiet space.  Exceptional omelette with very fresh ingredients.  Great coffee.  And Japanese Bento breakfast option as a bonus!  Best shiitake mushrooms I’ve ever had.  Love the mix of French and Japanese cuisine.  Exceptionally friendly and wonderful service.< /Text>

<date>1617475521042<//date><rate>5<//rate><review>We were visiting Palm Springs from Houston , TX. We enjoyed 2 wonderful meals at French Miso Cafe. The food is unforgettable! You can tell much love goes into their food and restaurant. Not only is the food amazing but the restaurant atmosphere is very special! The attention to detail in the food is very much appreciated. I had the herb omelette which was delightful the eggs were fluffy and light. It was not heavily salted which I prefer. We also enjoyed their miso soup which was the best miso soup we have ever had. They use fresh ingredients and you can tell. I also had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked perfectly and served over a light salad of fresh greens. Their croissants are fresh and everything you could ever want in a croissant, flaky buttery soft on the inside. Not to mention excellent cappuccinos. I would return to Palm Springs just to eat at this wonderful restaurant. Truly a gem.<//review>< Pics>

The presentation of the food and especially the banana foster were tantalizing. The atmosphere was comfortable yet elegant. They have great people who can make great food, it's definitely a keeper.< /review>

<review>If you like spice, this is the place for you! Don't worry, you can ask for the lowest level of spice so you could still enjoy your food.

I came out here with some friends and tried their papaya salad, tom yum and drunken noodles. It was awesome!!! I will definitely be coming back because of their small outdoor patio (that's behind the building) and amazing customer service.<//review>< rating>

<Text>Came here before New Years since we were in the area. The reservation was booked a month in advance, so keep your eye out for availability if you know you want to go here!

The food and atmosphere live up to the reviews. Although we had bar seating, it was quite entertaining to watch the chefs make our dishes. Originally, we considered ordering the squid ink salad, but after watching the chefs make it for other tables, we went with the gem salad for more variety.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1604413418856, 'text': 'Hi Margaret,\nI believe you have mistaken French Miso cafe with other restaurant.

<text>My partner and I were greeted with such a friendly woman at the podium, I believe she’s the owner. She quickly took us to our table and I truly feel like it was the best table in the house! Very secluded and romantic. The drinks and food was INCREDIBLE. We had the Bento box and the Ginger Pork. Please give these dishes a try. Every single bite was enjoyable. We had the pleasure of having Seth as our waiter. He’s a kind and  dry communicative. His positive attitude made this experience top notch. Also, the owner came by and put a chemical free candle next to us to help with the flies outside. We never complained about it but she just jumped into action. Very lovely place.</text>< resp>

<Review>Walking up to the smell of baked bread, this fusion restaurant invited me in for an absolutely wonderful meal. Tomoko immediately greeted us and took us to our table, where we sat outside in an open garden environment. Not only did this place provide amazing vegan choices (try the tofu and coconut rice entree) but they offered homemade dog treats for our pup. 10/10 and two huge thumbs up. Ask for Jay, she is amazing!!!</Review>< Pictures>

I love love love Wurstkuche Art District location. It's always busy but somehow we get served very quickly, food is hot and you still get a very private space in the seating area.

I come here at least once every two weeks for the past year and have never had a bad experience neither with food or stuff.

My go to are their vegan sausages and OMG their fries are to die for! You haven't lived if you haven't tried them yet

Thank you so much Art District team! Keep up good work< /review>

<text>O-M-G!!!  I gotta say, as soon as we looked in from outside, the place looked like a dive. I mean a comfortable dive, but, still a dive. But the service was great ( our white sangria was a little delayed, BUT REALLY good!)! Out  initial server was Keith; and he served us even after his shift was over it seemed, with Sarah, the person that was supposed take over after Keith left.<//text>< Pictures>

Welcoming and warm decor with personable service and delicious fresh food! The Japanese flavors are district and compliment each item on the menu.

The place is a little hidden so once you're on La Plaza, follow the sidewalk signs and you'll find yourself in a little cafe Oasis. There are only 8ish two or 4 top tables (some are combinable) so be patient, you may have to wait for a table.

Ramen is comforting and with lots of umami! They also sell "real" champagne, from Champagne, France so be sure to give it a try if you're treating yourself! This is truly a gem in Palm Springs if you're looking for something Japanese!</Text>

I've heard such good things about this place and was extremely hyped but I left feeling pretty disappointed... :^( It was yummy though? Our party of 5 ordered a large beef meal and an extra order of brisket and some of us were a bit hungry still? Maybe we didn't order enough but it ended up costing us almost $40 each!! :(

*the good**
-meat is def good quality..
-they cook everything for you (good for the lazys like me)
-plenty of sides to go around (reg salad, been sprout green onion salad, kimchi, dry seaweed, pancake, etc)
-the egg is delishuus<//Review>

A hidden gem for a hideaway breakfast-brunch right at the heart of Palm Springs. Unique and interesting menu, quality products. Great food, great service. Hopefully this place stays in business, given its "off-the-beaten path location".</Text>

Ahh, a French cafe that has got it.

Super sweet owner who understands the meaning of good service.  Was available when something was needed without stopping by
and interrupting us 5 times with the standard
‘is everything alright’.   (when did managers/owners get the idea that was good service??)

Our lunches were prepared perfectly by
someone who understands what French food
is all about.

Our first visit and we will be back.

An excellent experience.</review>

It's hidden in a beautiful courtyard just off the Plaza in downtown.
It's clear that the owners want to serve only original, high quality food. Their omelette is fluffy and flavourful, perfectly prepared. The ramen transported me back to my favorite shops in Tokyo.
We're looking forward to returning and trying their other dishes. French Miso is a great addition to Palm Springs.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

What a little gem of a place this is!  Small, out of the way, intimate with good food and a cosy ambiance in a hidden corner of Palm Springs.  French + Japanese?  Yes!  It works when you meet French Eric from Montpellier and Japanese Tomoko-san you'll understand why it works.   You can tell both are passionate about what they do and the cosy intimate place they are creating.  I liked that Eric, the chef, came out to talk with us about food, just like many of the small South of France bistro's might do it.  Bearnaise sauce on Eggs Benedict = brilliant & decadent.  It's different than the usual Hollandaise sauce.   Beautiful little ikebana flower arrangement on tables.  So Japanese!  Tomoko-san even surprised my dog with home made doggie treats and embodies the Japanese concept of omotenashi, / Japanese hospitality - surprising & delightful service.    I can't wait to go back.   They are a welcome addition to Palm Springs.</Text>

As others have said, this is such a hidden gem owned by French husband and Japanese wife. The wife told us that her and husband wanted to create a homey environment where patrons feel like they’re visiting their home. The food tasted amazing and the portion was just right. It’s a few blocks away from the Main Street, which helps keep the noise level very low. If you’re looking for a nice, quiet breakfast/brunch spot with a unique menu and tasteful decor, you have to check out this place. There is a reason why they earned near perfect stars on various review sites.<//Text>

Outstanding!  This is a little jewel tucked off Palm Canyon, and it feels like being in the French countryside.  The menu is small, and well chosen; the food is wonderful and beautifully presented.  Service could not have been nicer/better - and it’s a true loss not to visit ASAP.< /text>

Cute little place with great food. A little tricky to find, but we did. They have outdoor seating and that was what we chose. The garden adds to the experience and the day was gorgeous. Their prices are average. The salmon dish was 18. Mimosas and wines ranging from 9 up. We ordered the salmon and the chicken both from the lunch menu. They do have breakfast options. The salmon was great. But there was not a lot of food on the plate. It is a French cafe so their portions tend to be smaller. The chicken was very good too. If you’re really hungry you might consider ordering something else besides your entree. They were out of their pastries by 1130. We were not able to get croissants. If you want pastries be sure to get there early because according to one of the servers their pastries sell out quickly almost everyday. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. I would definitely go back.<//text>

Amazing! The food is packed full of flavor, not at all what I was expecting at a fusion restaurant. The wait staff are very attentive and I am happy to say extremely proud of the dishes they serve. The surprise star of the show was the mint smoked chicken salad, out of this world good!< /review>

Sit outdoors in the authentic classic Palm Springs La Plaza setting or inside a cozy art-filled dining room by the fireplace. It doesn’t get any better than this.
French food OR Japanese cuisine. Delicious coffees and teas.

This was a gem of a find! The restaurant has a cute decor, great place to eat and chill. Food was impeccable too! I tried coming back for the tofu and mango rice dish but they ran out. They ran out of many things huhu

The iced tea was made really well! It's the perfect cold brew taste. The green tea they used is a little roasty, which I loved. The black tea is amazing too. Most iced black teas leave a milk sour taste at the end because of how it's brewed but this one has a clean finish.

Pro tip: Come early next time! I time they're still on their soft opening so they haven't fully figured out the logistics< /Text>

A gem in the desert! At first, French Miso Cafe appeared to be a convenient and close brunch place to start the morning before we began our Coachella day. We were quite pleasantly surprised by the level of decor and service we were greeted with upon walking through the doors. Our food came quickly and we dug in. My girlfriend ordered the grilled tofu with mango, asparagus, and coconut rice, and I had the kalbi beef with asparagus and rice. While I loved my dish, I thoroughly enjoyed swapping plates with my girlfriend to finish off the tofu dish. I have found it difficult to enjoy vegan dishes as a meat-lover, but boy did I scarf down the grilled tofu and coconut rice. I highly recommend French Miso Cafe for anyone looking to fill their bellies and enjoy it too.< /text>

<Text>Very friendly staff! At one time they were not a very reliable pre-service but over the past 6 months things have changed. They have always cared about their customers but just seemed like there was disorganization. I'm very happy that the changes that were made are making Ceva a more reliable logistics company!</Text><Rating>4</Rating>< Date>

Said they would deliver between 9am and 1pm. They showed up at 5:30 with box badly damaged. Said their dispatcher sent them to Stockton first when I live within four miles.
They rushed off before I opened the box, there was an arm missing from the chair and we are left with a piece of junk that we  dont want. Terrible service.<//Text>

<Text>They expect you to blind side back into a door . If you find room to uturn and get to your door, you will find no room because there are dropped trailers in the way. I have been here since 10am,with a 1030am appointment. Its 315 pm and I'm still waiting for a door.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Dump of the place. Takes forever to get past the gate and the layout is backward. However they do unload halfway fast that's the only reason they are not 1 star.< /Text><Rate>2< /Rate><user_name>keith1541</user_name>< Date>

Horrible warehouse, it is amazing anything is done there, workers smoke marijuana on site and almost every safety hazard has been violated. The supervisors seem blind to it and uncaring. All in all if you want quality items without major damage on every product go somewhere else either CEVA corporate or OSHA need to step in.</Text>

I update my review about this place and give them 3 instead 5 due to their office problem.the office staff don’t pay attention to send prescription or referring to other physicians on time.but as I said last year,The best thing about this place is availability.easy appointment & access.i hope doing good changes in office.</review>

I was looking for new primary care doctor and made an appointment. I didn't know that this was a urgent care clinic. Each experience that I've had with the staff and care at moment dire consideration was a test without a doubt. I had a yearly actual done and specialist needed me to do an in-person follow up, so I thought there was something that justified that. I took the opportunity to drive there, stand by 30 minutes past my appointment time, at that point Dr Raj comes in and inquires as to whether all is well, after which he expresses that is it. In a real sense under 10 seconds. Obviously, they charge me copay and afterwards charge my protection over $500.

Even after this, I wrongly went with them for the Coronavirus neutralizer testing, as my protection covered it and it was with no copay. I even persuaded my better half to do it. The individual that set up the virtual appointment was right around an hour late. They at that point continued to charge my better half for her appointment. Subsequent to taking the counter acting agent test, I was informed that I ought to get the outcomes in about seven days. Multi-week passes by, no word. Fourteen days, no word. More than about fourteen days and I considered them to perceive what's happening and found that my outcomes were in some time in the past - they simply didn't present it on my records or inform me of it, so on the off chance that I never called, I would've never discovered.

Try not to commit similar errors I did. On the off chance that you esteem your time and don't have any desire to get defrauded by them to continue to return for reasons unknown, at that point don't utilize them. This urgent care is a rip off. Please stay away and save your money.<//review>

< Review>
I visited San Ramon Urgent Care & Clinic recently and had a great experience. Dr Raj took time to carefully listen to my condition. They even had a quick blood test done there and collected samples in the same office for further diagnosis. Definitely, saved a lot of my time and effort to book an appointed in a diagnostic lab another day and suffer longer waiting for the test result. The diagnosis was accurate and recovery was fast.

Thank you Dr Raj and San Ramon Urgent Care and Clinic.<//Review>

My experience here was excellent.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  They prescribed appropriate medication and I was in and out in 25 minutes.   And they were open on Sunday!  Charge was reasonable ($160), and they billed my insurance.  They're a great resource - I wish there was more like them around...<//Text>

After suffering from bronchitis for several weeks, I decided to go in and get checked after church on a Sunday morning. The staff and provider (nurse practitioner) were very friendly and thorough and got me in and out of there in less than 10 minutes. By the time I got to CVS, my prescription had already been called in and filled.
Having been in medical sales for over 15 years and and having worked with many providers and private clinics, SRUC is a model for efficiency and convenience and I would definitely use them again and recommend them to others.< /Text>

A completely rundown place by crooks, i jammed my thumb in a car door and went to them, they just chatted and tries to be friendly without suggesting anything or even having a look at the injury. I could feel that there was a problem with my thumb since I had continuous pain, i later went to sutter urgent care and they drained the pus that had formed in my thumb and put me on antibiotics. I tried calling san ramon urgent care and asking them why they did not diagnose at which point dr Raj said that “do whatever you can do”. I am going to report these quacks to the police and san ramon medical but please avoid this place< /text>

I like the clinic’s schedule - it’s convenient for people like me that works from 9-5
I was able to make a 6:45 appointment and was thankful for it
The staff was nice and I was treated by the actual doctor
Though one of the doctors took my blood test and I was bruised for weeks
Overall, good service and the doctor called me back with my results as he promised
I’ll definitely come back here again!< /review>

I have been going to San Ramon Urgent Care & Clinic for all my family members and have had excellent care and attention all the time I visited this facility. Dr. Raj is very competent as well as time efficient in his job performance, he is always quick and efficient in diagnosis and gives thoughtful explanations of our concerns and questions. Staff is very professional and welcoming and the best part of the facility that I must appreciate is the minimal waiting time .  I give 5/5 to this clinic and its highly recommended !!</review>

<review>Had to take my daughter to him as she was having some breathing issues. She never had anything like this before so we were unaware about the severity of her condition. Dr. Maheshwari quickly diagnosed that it was an asthma attack and started treatment. Within minutes she was able to breathe normally and was able to go to a birthday party that evening.
This was incredible given the fact that she was barely able to sit on her own in the morning. All I can say is Dr. Maheshwari has an incredible presence of mind along with wealth of experience. He is very nimble - meaning quick and accurate. On top of that, he is supported by very well trained staff. If you want a no nonsense physician who is also a good listener, I highly recommend Dr. Maheshwari and his urgent care clinics.< /review>< rate>

I made an appointment the night before and going in was efficient and easy. I got the antibiotics I needed and picked them up at the CVS nearby.  It took a bit longer than I would've thought to actually get the prescription, but I did get them. The appointment was $160 out of pocket without insurance, so keep that in mind if you don't have any.<//Text>

I got Medical RFE from other doctor, so approached Dr. Raj. He is so co-operative and did quick as early as possible.

Called Monday, got appointment for Wednesday and gave TB tests and blood work orders. Friday got the blood work reports and TB skin test positive. On Friday ordered Radiology order. By Monday Radiology order reports arrived and all documentation completed and gave sealed packets Monday. I don't think it can be done sooner.

He is very co-operative and gave all papers to check for make sure no mistakes.

For immigration, he charged $299 per head (lab, radiology and immunizations additional). I feel it is reasonable for his time and efforts.< /Review><date>1484277609160< /date>< Name>

I was at this place with the question and was very very happy to meet that Mongolian lady at the front desk. She was very professional and kind one, who did everything to find out correct way for us and answered the questions with high professional manner. You will be surely happy to visit that type of front desk service.<//Review>

Dirty clinic, NP or DR Elux kept on adding unnecessary services my son needed, he  couldn't even do a good enough job to submit my sons prescription correctly, I went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist  could not find my sons information, worst part the clinic was closed and my son didn't get his meds. Waste of time to come here, service sucked.  I wish people were honest and willing to help patients and not want to rack up their bill so they could benefit.<//text>

<review>This is the worst clinic I've been ever so far. Dr Raj is very less experienced and he lacks skill in this profession.This place is horrible and and with low standards. Please don't fall far the paid reviews here on yelp. I went once as it was closer to my place and will never return again. I wish I would have searched for another provider.They made me wait for  more than 30 mins , though I was in need of urgent care and I could see only Doctor available in clinic was busy over phone. Customer care was  totally irresponsible and wasn't paying attention, though I requested front desk many times about my treatment need as I was bleeding continuously. Even while providing treatment , Dr Raj looks confused how to treat wound and applied medicine /ointment randomly. Looks like I was his first patient in his life and I was feeling like I came to wrong place. Anyway he treated my wound/injury within 5 minutes and I was billed for about $800+. Once I reached home, still I found that wound has not been treated properly and still I was bleeding.
When next day I called the clinic , they responded rudely. Looks like clinic management is not mature and experienced enough. It was bad decision to come over here for treatment. Please don't fall for fake reviews on Yelp. If you really want to try this clinic, then please first go for some minor/small problem as demo. You'll realize soon what I mean. This clinic is totally waste of time and waste of money. Please search for other providers available in area , you'll find very good clinics with good reputations and brand name. Even other clinics are lot cheaper , this clinic charges $200+ as office visit charge on name of urgent care.Treatment, diagnosis and procedure charges are extra ....this will make your bill easily go up like $600+. Please beware of this loot, this clinic will scam you on the name of bill and you'll end up paying more than what you expect.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Dr. Maheshwari of San Ramon Urgent care has been our go to doctor since we moved to the Tri Valley area. His office is open in the evenings--so that was a huge plus initially. He takes our insurance and also works with patients who have no insurance but are willing to pay out of pocket charges. He cares about all his patients and is especially good with elderly patients too. Great bedside manners and outstanding support staff. We really love Marie.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Arch S<//user_name>< user>

If I could 0 star a place I would. Let me explain why this urgent care is possibly the worst medical center I have ever encountered in my entire life. First: I went in there and the nurse at the front desk started eating Doritos while inputting mine and one other persons info. She was so caught up in eating her Doritos she put my birthday in wrong. Because of her arrogance the pharmacy couldn't give me my prescription and I had to play phone tag. Because of this my insurance could not find me and identify me so I got sent the entire bill and now I am playing phone tag with the insurance.
Second: I was diagnosed with a UTI, however after going through antibiotics I still have the symptoms so I went to another urgent care and they do not believe it was a UTI and I have to wait for the results from another culture (a urine test pretty much). Pretty much, they diagnosed me incorrectly.
This place is a pathetic excuse for an urgent care<//Review>

After being sick for weeks I was very grateful to have found a Dr that is very caring and compassionate. He explain everything with great detail answered all my questions made me feel comfortable. I felt that he spent all the time I need it  without rushing me out the door. The best thing about all this was the wait time when all you want to do is get back home wait time is awesome !!!!!! Front desk ladies are also excellent  !!!!  The best part of everything I got a call from the dr he was following up to see how I was doing.... What other dr does that ???????  Thanks for all your time you spent</Text>

Do not go here. First visit started off great but...

When I sat down with the doctor she was very insistent on me getting a shot for my pain. I told her no 5 times and the pain was only a 2 out of 10.. felt like she either wanted to give her staff practice or get extra money out of me.

Also after getting some tests done at a different facility, because they don't have an ultrasound there, I was told I would get a call within an hour and if not to call in. I called in two hours later and was told "we will call you once a it's reviewed, it's on the doctors desk". And then hung up with out saying bye or please hold.

Come the next day around noon and still no call so I called them and got attitude from the person on the phone saying "i thought we told you we would call you once it's reviewed", and then proceeds to say the doctor looked at it and nothing major is there.... then why didn't they call me and tell me that....

On top of that when I confronted her about her hanging up the previous day she said "oh no you were on hold".... then why didn't you tell me "can you please hold" and why did the line go dead.....

Also when I went there there was absolutely no patients there.. so clearly they aren't that busy and it shouldn't have taken that long to get this done... it would have been faster to go to my normal doctor...< /text>

<review>We're glad to have found Dr.  Rajesh. My family recently moved to Dublin, and were looking for nearby doctors for my parents' care.  Although my parents were new patients, they were immediately at ease with Dr. Rajesh.  He is very caring and accommodating. It's been a year now, and every visit with Dr. Rajesh is a pleasant experience.< /review>< Rate>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Most useless place ever. Staff are nice on the phone but totally uneducated in terms of process, customer service as well as common sense. No wonder no dr ever stays here and most MDs stay for a year then leave. The urgent care facility is a joke, aka trailer home.This whole facility is very unprofessional.Doctor Raj don't genuinely care or have any interest in bettering you or helping you through difficult times.He spend most of it looking at their watches/clocks.This place always disappoints me with such poor management. First, the front desk in the medical clinic is awful, beginning with the receptionists.I was injured and needed urgent care, but the receptionist showed no compassion to my current situation, instead she started asking unnecessary questions and delayed in treatment.The wound was not treated properly and I was still bleeding once I returned home.Worst medical clinic in the state of California. I would never come back again. Please stay away from this place.</Text>< pics>

<Text>They don't respect your time - they never run on time - you can hear them laughing in the back as you wait in there lobby.The doctor was insulting, condescending, and had very bad manners. Do NOT go here. Get your pills from your family doctor. This place just wants to prescribe you as many drugs as possible.Horrible experience.The worst part is, they tried to push me to take medication that I don't need and when was about to leave, the doctor insulted me behind my back to the people waiting. I cannot believe that I would have to experience something like this from a doctor. All I wanted was Malaria pills.Its just ridiculous.I would avoid this clinic at all costs. The doctor cannot be trusted. Period.<//Text><name>Hanna Mel< /name>< response>

I amm a foreign trained doctor and would like to share my externship program experience at Dr. Rajesh's San Ramon urgent care clinic.

I had my Usmle Step 2 CS exam scheduled and was looking for an externship opportunity in the Bay Area. I learned about the San Ramon Urgent Care & Clinic Externship program through a friend and decided to enroll in their 1 month externship program under the guidance of Dr. Rajesh. That was the best decision I made as it tremendously helped me prepare for the CS exam. The externship experience has helped me to learn how the US health system works and also to gain good US clinical experience.

Dr. Rajesh is very knowledgeable, friendly, helping and inspiring doctor and a mentor. As part of the program, he educated me with the diagnosis and urgent care management of every case we see in the clinic which boosted my clinical knowledge. He also taught me how to check-in the patient, updating the electronic health record of the patient, how to do the lab orders and how prescriptions are done in US. I also had an opportunity to do the strep test, flu test, TB test and shadow Dr Rajesh while he was performing  minor procedures like suturing, removal and abscess drainage since it is an urgent care facility.

I also enjoyed working closely with the clinic staff Marie, Flor and De ja and learned a lot from them too. They are extremely respectful, kind and  friendly towards patients and also to students like me. Over all, I had a wonderful experience as a student doctor at San Ramon Urgent Care.

Soon after the completion of my externship program, I confidently appeared for the Step 2 CS exam in Texas and successfully passed with a high performance. I would credit my success to Dr. Rajesh and the guidance he has provided me. The experience I had gained is worth every penny I spent for this externship.

I would strongly recommend this externship program for any medical students and especially international doctors who are in the process of applying for residency. I'm very grateful to Dr. Rajesh for giving me such a fantastic externship opportunity<//text>

Horrible. Do not go here. They made me pay for extra services I didn't need. Told me the visit was covered by my insurance when it wasn't. Gave me loads of attitude when I asked about the situation. Didn't process my prescription. Please go somewhere else. Don't waste your time, money, and energy.<//review>

Took my mom to this Urgent Care, after calling them and confirming that they took United HealthCare. Turns out, they didn't. We received a bill claiming that we were "out of network" and after contacting the font office, received a terrible response. The lady at the front desk was extremely rude and was quick to turn the phone off. Furthermore, she claimed that she was the one to pick up the phone when we had first called to confirm. Terrible customer service. My mom has been referring patients to them.... never again! There are other Urgent Care offices in the area, don't go here!< /review>

<Review>Thanks Dr. Rajesh
I visited here for my spouse.
She had a continuous cough all over the night and was close enough for an emergency. Even if we tried at 2 am, we got an appointment for 9:30 am. He prescribed an antibiotic and the symptoms start reducing from same day and get cured in 3 days.<//Review>< resp>

Getting a prescription filled or refilled used to be like pulling teeth with many many calls, both to urgent care and my Pharmacy. Lately however, things seem to have gotten a bit more streamlined and the problem seems to have fixed itself.< /Review>

My package will be delivered estimate on Monday but when I called and was informed that it would be delayed till next day.
However, it is not important until I called them to pick up at their warehouse so I made the second call to their customer service. The representive told me that I can come and pick up right away. I also asked them do I need and comfirmation from their warehouse or some calls and they said no need to do that.
When I came to their warehouse to pick up, they told me that the package was not ready yet due to the container was still not offloaded so I had to come back next day. That's is the point what totally made me disappointed about their service.
At least, they have to work with their partner before informing any wrong information to their customer. This is really bad and not professional at all.< /text>

Worst managed company ever, i wish i could give them no stars.  They told me my package would be deliver on a Monday.  I signed up to be notified and no update was sent.  i called they told me delivery day was changed to Thursday.  i took off work and delivery guy rang door bell i ran down stairs and he was driving away, didnt wait for me to answer door.  i called to complain and the person who answered phone said she didn't work at the delivery center and she had no way to call the center.  You work customer support and you can't call you service center "REALLY."  She said all she could do was send an email and hope that someone would read it.  Oh the noticed they put on my door said they would re deliver the next day, no package still.  I could pre sign for it because the crate is worth $8,000.  So i took 3 days off from work to wait for package for no reason, and all they can do for me is say sorry.  They cant even tell me where my package is.  This is not the first time i have tried them and every time same thing.  My last time using them. These people are liers they told me it would be deliver and no package 4 days after they told me it would be deliver.</text>

< Review>
They delivered my package to the Amazon Facility it was signed by Jose Munoz and when I talked to the customer service it says it’s impossible to be recover. They advised me to get a refund. How embarrassing it passed the customs clearance and it was delivered to the wrong place and I instructed them that need to be signed by me. But it was signed by Jose Munoz. They told me the value it was $52 which is totally wrong. Why would they say something like that if they didn’t open it. It’s embarrassing because Asian people send it and it passed the customs in Asia and here in USA it will happened like this. Ontario DHL branch really need to be disciplined by DHL director, They ruining the courier names. Wake up DHL fired those employee can't do their job properly. Now my package is missing. They told me Jose Munoz is Amazon Rep, yeah right. I don't stop and just believe of what people says and come up with all kinds of reason. I found that Jose Munoz in >>>>>> and he works with DHL. When I told them I filed complaint to the police the gentleman I was talking to put me on hold for 53 minutes. I’ll update you guys what happened to my package it’s a big box by the way. I am requesting the Director of DHL to look up the services and the Ontario Branch given to the customers. I talked to the customer service yesterday and said they closed my case. I will post on facebook and Instagram and update you guys about this case. Since a friend of mine working on radio station I will pay extra to aired this issue until the Director of DHL helped me find my package.
Note: Don't ever deal with Ontario DHL Branch they are very shady.< /Review>

So far my experience has been absolutely terrible, they told me the package would arrive by the end of Friday a few days ago. After 6:00pm I couldn’t call them since they are closed and they don’t open Saturdays or Sundays! Neither do their Customer Service reps! This place is a joke!!! I seriously will never use this service EVER again! I payed extra money on a website for this JUNK of a service!< /Review>

If I could not rate this place I would, one of there employees hacked into my social media account, idk how but I got a delivery email coming from Ontario then 5 min later a email from one of my social medical accounts saying my information got changed and was logged into a Ontario location. Hmmm weird how I got a delivery email from this company at the Ontario location and then 5 min later a email saying my social media account was changed and was last logged into a Ontario lactation???? I know that when a package comes in to a office they scan Your package and workers can see your email.<//Text>

<Text>This company is not good or even ok with delivering your packages on time... I always try to be fair but they do not care about their customers. IPSY ships through this company still no matter all the complaints, it says to me they don't care about their customers receiving great service. Therefore I'm no longer going to be a customer. At these times as well, it's just unprofessional<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c3351e48f67651:0x37e7414c45ea2b8b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Appreciated the courteous and professional help over the phone in arranging a different delivery location over to the DHL Express ServicePoint in Ontario, CA. When I went to pick up the big package the counter person offered the carry it out to the car. Fortunitely these old bones could handle the heavy load but glad help was offered in case I needed it. Definitely DHL gets an  A #1 rating from me.<//Review>

<review>My experience this Holiday season with the ''big 3" .... UPS continies to leave packages in the damn driveway instead of bringing to the front door, Fed Ex has delivered to the front door..but not at my house and they can't find the package or tell me where it was delivered (Merry Christmas honey!)1, DHL delivered directly to the post office as requested.

Although communication confused me, I was able to call and find out where my package was and it was delivered before Christmas!<//review>< pictures>

To sum it all up for DHL: 1) changing delivery instructions means 4-5 days delay; 2) tracking information is unreliable and 4-6 hours late;  3) Out for delivery - in my case somebody look for the driver he's been  on the road for 2 days now. Conclusion: Do not use this service if you are on a time limit. Quick international shipments but when they get to a US distribution facility time stops. For the money you pay the service is shameful.<//Review>

Unfortunately, it is NOT arrived and when i called to track the package the agent has informed me that it is at Ontario location. i then called to Ontario and ask for the status. The agent says is reading off whatever i can track on the internet. I informed her the urgency of this package and i need help on this, perhaps to let me know which facility the package is currently locate at so i can go pick up. and she replied me with "well it is not here. i cannot make it appear." No one is asking her to make it appear, i am asking where can i pick up? how hard is it?
Not quite sure if the review even matters to them since it is already at 2.7 and does not seem like they are willing to improve themselves.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<name>Kandice Kinsley<//name><Text>I liked nothing from these people. A package was suppose to be delivered Thursday had a status of delivered and was not delivered. So I called the following day to inform them. I talked to a man around 10:45 and he said I will contact the driver and give you a call back. 2:10 I give them a call back with my concerns and a woman answers the phone. She said our supervisors are not in at the moment so they could not help me and the driver must be at lunch. They can't get ahold of him. So 10:45-2:10 drivers are at lunch. I believe these people stole my package and are all lies. Today Saturday I called not realizing they are closed remind you no one has called me. The man had the nerve to say did you check the property as if I leave trash in my yard for two days and missed a package.<//Text>< GmapID>

We shipped 2 boxes important cargos to Hong Kong in March 15 without any phone call nor email from DHL to us nor our customer they just returned to our shop 2 weeks later, after so many complains they just denied, called sales Rep and email them numerous times they never call back, they just want money
Worst company I ever seen in my life we will never use DHL again at same time we requested all our supplier and customers don't use DHL any more
Tried to give them "0" star but it won't let me

< Review>
Called for a time change to drop my package off and the driver was 3 1/2 hours early so I missed him on a Friday. A signature is required so I get a text message at 9am on Monday hat my package will be delivered by end of day Monday. So I sit at home from 9am till I finally call at 6pm to find out where my package is. The call center gave me no information other than it was loaded on the truck and then unloaded. I never received a text or any notification that my package was sitting at Ontario and not being delivered to me. The manager at the call center was not help at all and I demanded my package be the first one dropped off in the morning and he could not even do that. I would avoid this company at all cost because the customer is not first for them. I would give less starts but it wont let me.</Review>

Dreadful.  Worse than USPS.  They deliver from 10am to 5pm on weekdays  (when 8 - 5 people are at work ) then they close on weekends. Great! No wonder they ran out of business in USA.< /text>

My package was not delivered to me. I saw on the website that it arrived to Ontario on Dec 1, and I waited for the delivery. Two days ago, the status was updated to show that on Dec 1, it was delivered and signed by a person whose name does not match anyone in our household or immediate neighborhood. I called their customer service and launched an investigation, and according to investigator Roxanne, the driver "does not remember" where the package was delivered. I am pursuing all possible avenues for complaining about being defrauded of my package.</review>

I dont even want to give the 1 star i waited all day for my package. Didnt recieve anything Than i get a text message saying your package tried 2 be delivered 😡😡 tried scheduling a time when i would be there wouldnt let you so i called the service center they changed there number finally found 1 that works and got a lady with a attitude ask her if i can pick it up from the center I CANT asked if i can change the route I CANT and asked what time will the truck be there2:15-430. SMH told her i wouldnt be home i do have a job and all the other options I CANT.. In her words "well somebody needs to be there or your gonna have to wait til monday". I can go on but if u can avoid with this shipping company please do its really a hit and miss
Sincerely,
Angery customer with no options😡😡😡😡</review>

Negative 5! Worst delivery company ever. My package was supposed to be delivered on December 13th but when I track my order the shipment was still at the LA Customs & was released on December 14th early morning. The package arrived at Ontario DHL same day but for unknown reason was on hold for another day (maybe they don't have enough packages to deliver, and they don't want to pay the contractor just for few packages to deliver). December 15th it was out for delivery & somebody was at home waiting for the delivery but DHL didn't show up. Next day we checked online & it states delivered, where the hell is our package DHL! I'm sure you know what happened next. Of course I called DHL and today (December 16th) they are still figuring out what happened to my package. Based on my conversation with DHL it was a contractor who delivered the package. For me that means DHL has no capability to service door to door, not like UPS & FedEx. They even called left a message that somebody should be at home because it might need a signature, they're just wasting somebody's time!< /Review>

Zero stars. Worst shipment service I ever came across. I order something on the amazon and I am not even aware amazon picked DHL for this. I get an update from amazon that the shipment is out for "delivery today" at 7AM in the morning. I wait all day at home and nothing comes. At 8PM I get another message, "delivery attempted but failed to deliver". I am surprised as I am waiting all day. No one even called me. And this is a Friday. DHL is closed saturday and sunday. I call amazon and amazon gets DHL on the phone and they say "you are in a gated community, your gates were closed, so the driver left". The hilarious part is the gates are always closed. The driver or dispatcher needs to let me know that someone is at the gate so I can let them in. They are going to do the samething come Monday, because the gates are always closed. I call the DHL office on Monday to explain the story and they say "we don't give cell phones to our drivers, some people wait outside their gates to receive shipments" and that it is upto me to hunt down who the carrier company is, where they are coming from and plead with them to get my shipment delivered at the right place. As a delivery company, they assume no responsibility of actually making sure the shipment is delivered right. I spent three hours on the phone with them. They don't have a clue about customer service or shipping to residences. They are so much a freight company (I guess) they should NOT do residential service. I lost two days of work because of DHL!</Review>

The best experience. Doctor, Nurses, Staff, food, help for a 1st time mom who was clueless, & not to mention the place I got to meet my son <3 Thanks to his dad, we created 2 perfect humans. Braxtyn Dean Larcade was the 1st

I remember worrying if Blake wasn't going to make it in time to meet our son. After being up all night/day at the hospital, he went to grab necessities. But as always, his timing was perfect. He showed up with enough time to calm me down, & enjoy watching our son being born. I had my eyes mostly shut until my son was passed to me. Then I opened them and said "I just love him so much". After that I was ready for another baby since he was so perfect. & no, I'm not kidding. Which is why Leightyn happened soon after.. mine & Blake's 2nd perfect little Human <3</text>

<Text>I am grateful for the care I have received at CHOMP.  Most of the doctors have been helpful and caring as well as the nurses and staff.
I am also grateful for the care and Love shown to my parents when they both had Covid and my Father was dying.  The doctors and nurses kept my Father comfortable and they allowed my Mother to hold his hand as he went to eternal sleep. I am forever grateful that they allowed my Mother to be there as he passed away during these difficult times.</Text>< GmapID>

<Text>The emergency room's staff here are really friendly. They make you feel that you are in good hands us soon us you arrive to their parking lot. The security officer gave us a wheelchair as soon us  he saw us walking in.
While waiting in line to check in, the front desk lady checked with us in how serious it was the emergency in case we needed to get help ASAP. All the people here show a lot empathy for others which is great to have in a hospital. Thank you all!!!!< /Text><time>1547361875670</time>< Pics>

Disaster. During Covid Pandemic just when all the hospitals and treatment centers around the world are working to help people to reduce their pain and problems, This hospital tries to get as much money from its clients as possible even for small services. I can only say abuse and tragedy< /text>

I can’t believe how incompetent CHOMP has been. I used to think they were great, but this experience was trash. With a family member in the ICU, I was given no updates by doctors or nurses. When they woke up, I wasn’t contacted for over 24 hours. I have called MULTIPLE times and asked to talk to a doctor with nothing. They aren’t including direct family in any decisions and are being straight up stupid. Terrible communication, stupid doctors and incompetent reception staff. Boo all around<//Review>

<date>1611271450817< /date><rating>1< /rating><review>Absolutely worthless billing department. Took them ten months to figure out my sons bill from a minor injury from collegiate basketball. I called in May to make sure it was handled. Insurance had already sent $3600 (minor injury), then all the sudden in September/October/November they sent a bill for $235 to our old address that had already been updated. Communicating with "Rob***" from billing was laughable in itself. Inconsiderate from the start until the end. The best quote was "well if you were in the business you'd understand." 😂<//review>< Pictures>

Last surgery in July went perfect. Redo surgery not so good. Anisesian didn't block me enough so where last surgery no pain, this surgery I didn't feel the care or concern by staff it felt more like I was driven through a cattle yard and dumped. There wrapping up the surgical area they did such a poor job that it all started falling apart by day 2. Very dissapointed for the first time.<//review>

My 80 year old dad went in for a chemoembolisation for his liver cancer (the procedure did not work) and stayed there to recover overnight. They charged my parents an extra 3000, which Medicare will not cover, because CHOMP classified my dad as a "visit," not an "admission." My 80 year old mother said that a nurse, or someone,  walked up to her during my dad's  recovery to have her sign a form. The person claimed that the form was required  to be signed, and that was it. My mother,  being 80 years old and already stressing about the surgery, and trusting this person, signed it. Apparently that form is the reason why Medicare wont cover my dad's extra 3000. It stated that my dad's  hospitalization was a visit and not an admission for surgery and recovery, meaning that Medicare doesn't cover visits. I feel that my elderly mother was tricked into signing something  that caused her to pay thousands out of pocket. A scheduled procedure was performed that required recovery. It wasn't a visit! My parents are old and low income. Instead of resolving it, CHOMP was pushing them to sign up for a payment plan. If they had just let Medicare pay for it, they would have still been paid without causing any hardship on my elderly parents.</Review>

Forced to verbally tell why I was coming to the ER at the front desk in front of other people. I was given very little information on my test results from the doctor and only after I had to pry. The doctor was so CYA and unknowledgeable about my situation that she just kept lying to avoid answering. It was awful. Not to mention stained sheets and they left some lab test on the counter and put used utensils in the regular trash can rather than the medical waste can. I seriously learned more from Google than the doctor!< /Text>

I went in for a temporarily crippling muscle spasm in my back that forced a deep pain when I inhaled. When they were checking me in out front due to new Covid protocols, i had a series or communication issues that stemmed from the worker interrupting me as i tried to explain my symptoms. I was brought in and was being prepared to be tested for Covid when I explained what was actually the issue.
They gave me a bulivocaine injection that caused an allergic reaction. The nurse began to panic and felt the need to google what to do in case of a severe reaction to the injection.
When I was stable, communication issues further made my stay unpleasant. I was told to leave then told to stay by every other nurse and doctor that came into the room,  extending the time necessary for me to be there by over an hour.
Let your patients speak before you treat them for something they don’t actually have. At no point did i feel safe of cared for in the emergency room.< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Do not go to this hospital!!  What a racket!  I went to the ER for dehydration and was labeled as "moderate severity" for $286 and 2 months later, I got a bill for $426 saying I was "high/urgent."  I would not classify dehydration as high/urgent.  Moderate sounds more appropriate.  This seems like a way to get more money from patients, and they are already very expensive for care that just seems adequate.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>My nephew was admitted here after an unexpected stomach pain. Turns out his appendix had burst. I couldn't be more happy to say he received compassionate care from the beginning in the ER to the ICU . I was beside him the whole time night and day and I can't say enough good things. Furthermore I was happy with the cafeteria. I wish it was open 24 hours but perhaps that wouldn't be a sustainable idea at this particular hospital. Furthermore my oldest was born in this hospital and I was thrilled with the birthing ward as was my wife.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Fortunately I was only driving a friend for a blood test.  What I saw was distressing.  The many conveniently located entrances are blocked.  Water fountains and bathrooms not obviously marked.  Lots of attitude.
I was simply looking for some water for my dog's water bowl.  This place is not visitor friendly.  Since they have no clue about how to accommodate visitors, I question their treatment of patients as well.  Do not expect to find a convenient parking place, and the round-abouts are poorly designed.  This place has many bad reviews.  We should have the best care in this affluent area.  Salinas Valley Memorial is better.<//Text>

My brother had open heart surgery here, and everyone has been wonderful! They keep us informed and answer all of our questions. The medical staff is very friendly and caring. The facility is clean and modern. They have art everywhere which is nice to see. Everything is set up to create a relaxing environment. There’s even a koi pond. The cafe offers good food at a decent price.
I’m glad my brother was able to be cared for at such a great facility!< /text>

ER has always been great. Our family has always for generations had excellent patient care until today. My son was in ER and he had a nurse from hell name "Debbie" at 6:45pm she came in with a very prideful way about her not really prideful. Sad but true. She started a IV and and made comments about his scares. from motorcycle accident the proceeded to start IV in hand when he has great veins? Next was the bloodwork Dr. ordered she didn't label so lab had to come and draw him agai! She came into his room and never even acknowledged the error? He has thrown up. At least 10 times in a hr and all meds are by IV but brings him a pill and asks him to try and keep it down!!  I am hoping for a better experience with our next visit to CHOMP. We have had 4 decades of coming here with excellent pt care but this one has a lot to learn.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Does the hospital really demand and time doctors that are on call to the hospital so that during their exams of patients outside the hospital they constantly interrupted?  Have NO confidence that EMG was done correctly with 7 interruptions during the exam!!  The EMG was done at a Montage facility and now I'm considering changing out of Montage to assure that I have the proper care that I need.

Sent phone number three times over 4 days to the email they provided.  Have NOT heard back.  In looking at other reviews they say the same thing....send phone number and staff will contact you.  Wonder if this is their standard response to make it look like they care, but nobody is ever contacted!?!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I went to the ER after falling off the roof. The attending physician and staff were nice and attentive but care was subpar. The nurse starting the IV gave no advanced warning and stuck me while I was talking to the doctor. She drew out blood for labs but never labeled the tubes and forgot to take off the tourniquet (my accompanying family member found it over an hour later). I landed on my head. The doctor ordered a CT scan but no cervical x-rays. Also, I injured my left wrist, which was never x-rayed, nor was I given a wrist splint. The physician and staff were nice but sloppy.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmap_id>

Honestly, a poor experience from receiving care through obtaining medical records and even billing. There has been issue after issue dealing with this hospital since I visited. The care I received was sub-par, the record department was not responsive, and my billing is quite a mess to clean up. If you have alternates available, I would suggest that instead!</Review>

Horrible! This hospital kept my son in the ER 23 hrs just giving him fluids after a wisdom tooth extraction. I found out from someone else who was held in the ER they do that bc insurance won’t pay unless you are moved to a regular room! I now have a bill for $10,500 & have been fighting it for almost a yr!< /Text>

I am not too happy with my last visit. I was there today at 1:45 pm and it wasn't that bad of a wait but it wasn't too clean. I had to clean around my chair and the  restroom in the ER before using.  The nurse @ triage was helpful and made me feel like I was a           Priority.<//Review>

<username>Spanish Fly<//username><Review>What is it with this hospital?  Recently, a friend with previous heart related issues, was hospitalized at C.H.O.M.P for a couple of nights. I went to visit him and noticed something about the nurses and doctors right away - most of them are very attractive.  Ive never seen that many good looking nurses and doctors in one hospital (and ive been to many hospitals ). During casual conversation with a nurse, I happened to mention my observation. I hope he didnt take it the wrong way and feel violated or offended.  If you happen to read this sir, I wasn't trying to be rude or offensive ( just sayin' because it's like walking on eggshells with some people these days.  You think you are giving them a well intended compliment ..).  Anyway, they are very friendly at this hospital and you really get the feeling they care about their patients.  The hospital rooms are large , modern, and accomodating. A modern hospital with excellent physicians,  nurses, and staff.< /Review><userid>103136316085737935603< /userid><Rating>5</Rating>< response>

I wish all hospitals will be are like this place.
Beside high professionalism and pretty high tech level along with clean and comfortable rooms, personnel are great and friendly.
Location, design and maintenance make this place to help people to recovery faster and easy after treatment.</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Short review: This hospital should have their "baby friendly" accreditation completely removed. Terrible experience and will absolutely never deliver another baby here.

Long review: It has taken me quite some time to be able to digest the experience I had at CHOMP delivering my baby. My labor & delivery actually was very smooth thanks to the help of my doula. However, my daughter was born with fluid in her lungs that required immediate care. Within 24 hours, the fluid had cleared her lungs. However, during that time, she developed a very mild case of jaundice. They wouldn't allow my daughter to stay in the room with us on a blanket, and made my choice to breastfeed absolute Hell on earth. They INSISTED on feeding her donor milk & formula with absolutely no evidence based reasoning, only giving me 10 minutes max at a time to feed my baby every three hours. At one point I demanded her chart and found that she had been given donor milk multiple times without my consent or knowledge. The nurses would physically snatch my daughter out of my hands while feeding her and shove a bottle into her mouth. I even had one nurse poke and prod at my breast while saying, "It doesn't seem like she's getting anything, time for me to feed her." It was devastating, humiliating, and truly made me feel as though I couldn't possibly breastfeed my child. On day three of this nightmare, my husband and I begged the nurse (unsure of her name, elderly woman with PHD on her badge) to let us have the baby in our room... she proceeded to tell the doctor we were trying to kill our baby! The doctor called us on our room phone SCREAMING, saying we were putting our daughter's life in danger by not listening to them. All because of this one nurse from Hell. The next morning of our nightmare stay at CHOMP, we were finally told that we could take our baby home. I could not believe it. It was the best day of my life.

This only scratches the surface of the issues we had while we were staying at CHOMP. They forced us to move rooms in the middle of our stay to free up "labor rooms", and NO ONE used that room over the next three days. They only delivered us four of the 16 meals we were supposed to get while we were there, and two of those we couldn't eat because of allergies that were ignored. We were billed for every meal anyway.

The only bright spot in our whole experience was Amy, a nurse that was so kind, so thoughtful, so compassionate that I memorized her schedule during my stay and got so excited when she brought us our baby. I have not forgotten her and doubt I ever will.  She would let my daughter stay with me longer than the 10 minutes I was "allowed", and she could tell how painful and unnecessary the experience was for us. I hope she reads this and knows that she is absolutely phenomenal!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

No death certificate!  My brother-in-law was admitted to the ER and subsequently died of natural causes.  His care at the hospital was caring and their communication was good with the family.  However, Dr Close wouldn't / didn't sign the cause of death, therefore no death certificate could be issued.  This went on for 10 days until the coroner finally had to take possession of the body and do an examination to determine cause of death so a death certificate could be issues.  This was horrible for the family - nearly 2 weeks later and we still can't have a funeral!< /Text>

Beware of billing practices;
My wife visited this facility while we were on vacation due to a bladder infection.. We received a non itemized bill a month later for $956 for the office visit. Upon further investigation we were finally able to receive a itemization of the bill, only to find out that they charged $232 for a  pregnancy test on a 53 year old woman that had gone through menopause 6 years ago!<//Review>

Generally speaking, this is one of the best hospitals I have been in, as a patient, visitor and medical advocate.  There may be some quirks here and there (e.g., following Medicare rules algorithmically rather than looking closely at the patient details), but they are understandable, and the personnel are open to hearing you and taking the feedback to heart.  I would recommend this hospital to anyone.</text>

<review>Update-

Seriously what is wrong with this place. I recently came in this time because my daughter had a fever. Waited 2 hours. Again they let people in with minor issues before us and other people. After multiple visits I can say for certain that they are DISCRIMINATING DUE TO CLASS. The affluent people get in first.

(Original)
Some times the visits are fantastic. Other times it's a nightmare. I visited the ER for severe abdominal pain and vomiting had me waiting 3 hours without any help. Meanwhile people with a leg cramp and nose bleed get right in. (Not exadurating) Whoops! They forgot about me....

Every person and medical professional I know has had at least one bad experience at CHOMP. I don't know if it's a management thing or what?< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1505336924881, 'text': 'We’re sorry to hear about your experience and have shared your comment with our management team.

Fast, amazing, contemporary doctor. I left cured after dealing with an incredible amounts of pain for months.

I live in San Francisco and would consider coming back even if it meant driving.</review>

Easily the best hospital I have ever been to. As some others have mentioned they have their quirks but for the most part the service is exceptional. The ER is truly second to none and the longest I have ever waited is 2 hours. I know they probably have their bad days but compared to other ERs that can take up to 6 hours to get treated, this one is exceptional. You can tell that it is because the people are proactive problem solvers and they care and that's usually all it takes to provide excellent service like the service at CHOMPs</Text>

<Review>I’ve only been here one, but 4 years ago. My side of the eye and mouth weren’t closing.  A program I was in took me to the ER. The Dr (forget his name) looked at me! And say it was proably Bell’s palsy.  (Temporarly damage of a nerve in face casting temporary Parylasis to one side of face). The wait was short and parking was easy!  I was in and out quick. And the palsy ended up ending within the month. I did follow up as asked,  with our primary Dr from Kasier, who also agreed with Chomps diagnosis and helped with the process.
Good expirence!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>Had 4 babies, different hospitals for each due to being in the military.  This was the worst hospital experience out of all my children.  The nurses were the worse.  1st nurse refused to call the doctor because she said I wasn't having a baby. Later she told me to hold the baby in until the doctor arrived. Needed help to go to the restroom, and by help I mean a wheelchair, nurse came in and opened the bathroom door and looked at me.  When I said I needed the wheelchair, she pushed it by my bed, I tried to get to the wheelchair and I fell on my knees to the ground and ended up with a badly injured knee. Surprised by how badly me and my baby were treated for such a nice looking hospital.</Review>< pictures>

So disappointed in the way CHOMP has changed. Used to be a good hospital. Not anymore. The linens are terrible. The rubber covered foam they call a bed is torturous at best. The nurses are very nice but not very competent. They tell you one thing and do another, repeatedly. Many staff members do not speak english well enough to understand.  There is no communication from doctors. Between nurses or patients. Orders are not followed and or given correctly or in a timely manner.
I'm afraid Everytime my father is admitted. His  age makes him a cash cow, at the same time insignificant and an irritation.
Chomp holds the monopoly. If your doctor is associated, you have no choice.
You don't dare question or complain for fear of your loved one being ignored or mistreated.<//Text>

<Text>I had a severe almost fatal infection.  I was taken in immediately and underwent surgery to remove this infection.  I had 2 surgeries performed by Dr Verlenden and his awesome team.  I was in ICU for 2 days.  Due to the incredible Dr Verlenden, my life and my leg was saved. I was in the hospital for 16 days.  My stay at the hospital was fabulous.  The nurses, the assistants, the doctors, the staff, the janitors, the food, the harp player, the beautiful paintings and many many Christmas Trees provided by this hospital made my stay memorable.  Also, a shout out to the awesome Dr Silk and his Wound Care staff and fellow doctors.  Dr Silk performed a skin graft that 4 months later has completely healed.  I can only say that Dr Silk and Dr Verlenden saved my life.  Their bedside manner was impeccable and caring.  Not one day went by without Dr Verlenden updating me on my care and progress.  Thank you CHOMP!  Thank you to all the Doctors especially Dr Verlenden and Dr Silk.  Thank you to the wonderful and compassionate nurses.  Thank you too all the staff.  I am forever thankful and grateful!</Text><Gmap_id>0x808de687e280bfed:0x58ccec6d4490e8a7<//Gmap_id><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Utilized the Emergency Depeartment. CHOMP was a typical ER for the most part, though a bit faster & more efficient than most ERs I'm accustomed too.

Everything else has been top notch, phenomenal. Have unfortunately spent about 6 months here (off & on) over the past 12 months & have never received better healthcare in my entire lifetime. Incredible institution.< /Text><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Went to the emergency room here. I am from Minnesota, however my insurance company assures me this hospital has the most outrageous ER expenses they have ever seen. That said, with insurance my bill was almost 4000 dollars. I was there for three hours, received an ultra sound, a knee brace, 2 vicadin, and a prescription for vicadin. Insane- ridiculous!

I am well off so my guess is I am paying for people who don't have insurance or those who can't afford it. As heartless as it may seem this is not my problem but this ER has made it so.

The care however was adequate and the staff was professional and courteous. Just way over priced.< /review>< user>

I have been going through lots of complications..
I go to chomp s twice a week to do my NST .. we make appointments in advance so when we go there we are checked on time .. My appointment today  9/26/17 was at 10 am .. I went early 9.30 am .. The nurse name Kiki was so stubborn in the birthing center,   and she said you have to be rescheduled coz you did not called an hour early .. it sud be hospitals duty to call for the reminder.. I ask the whole team of chomps What’s the use of making adavance appointments .when you go on the time of your appointment and they reschedule you . I have coming for NST more than 10 times and half the time I didn’t call I just came inn half an hour early .  All other nurse never complained and never rescheduled me .. I give all other nurses 10/10 but Kiki I will rate her as 0 .
Kiki was very rude . I wouldn’t have minded to wait an hour extra , but her talking tone was so rude that I to leave .. I don’t want this kind of nurse like Kiki even doing my NST ..</text>

<text>ER was the only option for local after hours Urgent Care needs. the service was fine. HOWEVER I WAS BILLED $996 charge for a T-dap vaccine (TETANUS SHOT). This same shot would have cost $60-100 max in any other clinic. If offered a tetanus shot in the ER I would highly encourage you to have the staff declare if this is vital to be done here an now, and if not I would suggest you walk into Walgreens or any other medical facility the next day and not get ripped off by the Hospital's outrageous over billing for this commonplace vaccine!!!!!  The physician did not warn me of the expense, offered the shot casually as a good suggestion to update my health records. The staff should not be upselling non-critical services at 10x rates in the ER!!!  BTW this was for a dog bite wound on a finger, physician applied a steri strip, wrapped the finger in gauze and a wrap, suggested the tetanus shot. less than 5 mins in the ER room, and a $1,700 resulting bill.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808de687e280bfed:0x58ccec6d4490e8a7<//GmapID></record>

I went in to the ER for pain related issues, they took away my drivers licence. I tryed to get an explanation from their admin and got nowhere. If it comes to dying and going to CHOMP let me die. These people are useless.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I am very happy to have been treated in this hospital. The doctors and nurses as well as physiotherapists and occupational therapists have done an excellent job. They were always courteous and friendly.
Thanks for that.

<Text>GREAT SERVICE. ALWAYS ASK FOR ALAN... HE IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST!!! Sooo I’m one of those people who is probably hated by the universe because I have come to Family Tires about 5 times already in about 4 months because I keep getting nails/screwdrivers in my tires!!! But every time I come I get EXCELLENT service by Alan, and quite honestly almost every other guy here. The ONLY REASON WHY I DIDNT GIVE THEM 5 STARS IS BECAUSE the manager (or perhaps the owner) seems to be a bit more rude than his employees (or his team). He does not always have the best treatment for people... liiiike he didn’t want to let me pay while they were working on my car EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY TOLD ME HOW MUCH I’D BE CHARGED. Seriously?? I needed to run out of there so I could go to work. But whatever. I can overlook him as long as I deal with the other nice guys there. Seriously, quality services, great prices, and really quickly too!! :) do not regret going there!</Text>< Pics>

I came in to replace a flat that I was sure was a total loss. I was helped immediately, zero wait time. When the gentleman who helped me asked, "What can I do for you?" I replied, "I need to replace a flat. Find me a match and give me a price quote." The gentleman could have given me exactly what I asked for. Instead, he thoroughly examined the flat and determined that it was repairable and would cost $8. In addition,  every other employee that I interacted with was very friendly. Their name matched their vibe, "Family". It's so refreshing to come across a genuinely honest and welcoming business.Even though their shop is a little far from where I live, they have earned my business! I will definitely buy my next set of tires from Family Tires!</text>

Also several friends have told me of there experiences with family tires. I have never heard a foul word uttered about family tires. I would strongly recommend this business.<//review></record>

<Review>Awesome awesome awesome! Went in because I had just gotten a flat and needed something after 5. Lucky for me these guys stay open until 7! They worked tirelessly to make sure that they gave me the best service instead of just up charging me for a new tire.

Management is well in touch with their customers and is always willing to go the extra mile to make sure they go home Happy. The owner is a good person with a good heart and you can always trust him to help you out. The mechanic is on his game and knows almost everything about cars any type any model. The guys who fix tires know what they are doing.< /Review>

Stay away from this Horrible business!! I pulled into the place and one of the mechanics crashed into my car. He left a huge dent in the front of my car. The manager came out and tried to blame me for it. He tried to say I was illegally parked. I wasn't even parked, I simply pulled in for 10 seconds and his mechanic crashed into my car. STAY AWAY FROM THIS LITTLE BUSINESS! NOT GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO! THE MECHANIC DIDN'T APOLOGIZE FOR JACKING UP MY CAR.< /Text>

<review>Haven't stopped in for a few years, but when I was deeply involved with 1/18 and 24 I was in weekly. I'd put my models in dioramas, so I'd buy cars and model figures. They were always willing to make a deal.<//review><user_name>Steve Stark<//user_name>< time>

I love this store, I come here to find what ever weird RPG book I need or any kitchy gifts for almost any occasion.  A fun store the employees are cool, a few became some of my best friends (they no longer work there) But I still have I warm fuzzy spot in my heart for this great place.</Review>

A+ store, the owner Greg is a great guy who knows about the collectibles he is selling and he really has a passion for providing the best service for his customers and help to get them that one collectible they are after. Very friendly and great prices, he always seems to be getting his shipment of funko pops before everyone else.<//text>

<Text>I went in to the store to purchase a collectible HW they had listed online but when I showed up, the person running the shop let me know he "cant remember where I put that."

A bit thrown off, I asked if it was something I could help look for, not wanting to have made a trip for nothing and trying to add this rare piece to my collection but again got a very odd reply along the line of " not really, I wouldn't even know where I could have put it..." I tried to ask if when he found it he could give me a call of I left a number but he interrupted me to say "I'll just relist it on Ebay if I do"

So customer in person vs ebay and PayPal fees + packaging and shipping items... and I was offering help looking for it...

Why be so cold and uninteredted in customers or the items you have for sale that they drove to you to buy IN A HOBBY TOY SHOP?? This guy didn't have a good enough attitude to bang groceries, such a shame, I'm local and spend $1000 on my hobby and he will get none of that business.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1588896962318, 'text': 'I dont need liars in my store.

Amazing views and it was nice to catch some nature in Nevada. The only downside is PG&E has pretty much privatised most of the roads here<//review>

<text>I love hiking in this area. The pools are crystal clear and the scenery is magnificent. This is the perfect place to picnic, hike, relax and forget about the fact that you're so close to civilization. You can fish here too but trust me when I say you won't catch much or anything. Most come here to snap photos. So whether you're a photographer, an adventurer a hiker or a weekend warrior then you just cannot go wrong with this area. .</text>< Pics>

Beautiful spot. The water is remarkably clear. Short walk to the first pool, which can get crowded. There are more pools but they require some scrambling over rocks to get to. Great fun!<//text>

Emerald pools is a great place to check out for the whole family. I'd recommend getting in early as possible as the lot is small. Cars end up parking along the road as the day progresses. The hike or shall I say stroll to the pools is very easy and good for kids. Do bring life vests for the little ones as they will want to get in and enjoy the water. Water is as cold as you'd expect it to be.< /Text>

A wonderful place   Semi crowded But you can find a good distance Wonderful rock edges  And freezing cold water   And there is a small area just perfect for swimming and you can find some in life at the edge of the pool<//Review>

<Time>1605559287268</Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>It's a really beautiful place but we went on a day during the weekend and it was super busy and packed with people and the water was freezing cold, so we didn't stay long and headed to another spot farther down the river where there was less people and the water was much warmer. I definitely look forward to coming back on a day when it won't be as busy because it's really a beautiful location and worth the hike to get to it! It's a great location to bring a family that enjoys spending time surrounded by nature and enjoying the outdoors.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great water spot that's easy to get to. Main pool gets busy after 11am but if you trek up the rockway there are some smaller pools that are less crowded. Recommend arriving early.</Text>

<Review>This place is overcrowded. We got stuck for a half hour because of the line of cars trying to get in and the cars had a hard time getting past each other. Someone randomly got out to direct traffic thankfully. It is kind of a long walk depending on where you park. There's not really any signs but we asked some locals and the trail is just to the right of the bridge (to the right meaning when you first come to the bridge from the main entrance road) past the little dirt parking area. You will walk for about 5 min down a dirt/gravel trail and then it will be to your left. You will then walk through a little stream and you will be at the main area everyone post pictures from. Theres almost nowhere flat to hang out, for the most part its boulders and rocks. Theres no bathrooms, except about a mile back up the road, so you better go before you get there. A lady actually yelled out she took a poop in the water and another lady responded with 'yea, i see it floating'. The place was packed with people drinking, loud music and people in their underwear. We weren't fazed with the underwear, to each their own, my teenagers thought it was pretty great lol. The water is freezing. Don't get me wrong its a really pretty place but it was just too much with too many people and poop in the water. Try to go here on a weekday.</Review><rate>3</rate>< user_name>

<Text>Perfect for a DayCation get away! hicking, picknicks, and swimming. However, I would only recommend swimming in the summer since the water is ice cold. As a result of the pandemic, I recomend going early in the morning to avoid crowds.... and find parking. Like the pictures, the water is very clear,  surrounded by lots of trees, and rocks! Overall, it's a beautiful place to visit.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Went here for the first time and I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. The water is truly a beautiful emerald color, and the rocks are also very pretty. Great family destination. Our pup especially loved the pools. Highly recommend. As a bonus, there is a lot of nearby campgrounds to choose from.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Nice place to relax although the water is freezing but the view is beautiful 😍 it is recommended to arrive early because it is always crowded.

<Review>This Pleasanton WM is a busy place. As soon as you enter a waft of weird odor is there.  Then when in store near the groceries aisles there is an unpleasant stenchy smell throughout the area.  It is a very unpleasant feeling shopping there these days.  This store used to be great and now it's falling apart.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>I'm just trying to buy some boxers. I get why it gets locked up but why is the person who has the keys not there to open it when customers needs it. I don't get the complications. Walmart mind as well make vending machines for boxers since the associates can't handle opening it to sell to the customers.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808fe949eb3c2021:0x16f8e08a95a280ac<//GmapID></record>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>Prices vary...so better to do your homework for shopping prior to going.
Bird seeds are very competitive.
Propane gas is cheap...at least $2 cheaper from Homedepot.
Great selection of Breakfast cereals.
Cleaning supplies you should check with other stores as some brands are overly priced.
Electronics and Home appliances are very limited selection so not worth going to Walmart. Except Black Friday for some real bargains.
Management needs to Train the staff to greet customers as most of the staff at Gate lacks human emotional touch. Greeting someone doesn't cost  a Penny more. Perhaps it's the Management culture at Walmart, I am not sure as I have never worked with them.

Over all Jack of All Trade, Master of None Shopping store.< /review><Date>1619847268521< /Date><Rate>3</Rate>< GmapID>

There was one time I was looking for cleaning vinegar, I asked 3 associates- they couldn't help, I ended up driving to target. This is probably the worst Walmart in the world - well that I have been to. Horrible customer service, dirty and untidy, smelly too.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Actually they have justified reason for following me around while I shop, kinda...but I still don't like it, kinda. Just makes me feel obligated to look like I'm stealing more. That way they are obligated to follow me. Despite the fact I'm not actually stealing it's a fun making them think I am. It's a game of cat n fake mouse.<//text>

<text>When I first moved to the peninsula, I didn’t realize that I didn’t have a local Walmart. Being a book dealer, I’ve been traveling through the Bay Area. When I finally got to go to a Walmart, I was excited to look up all the skin line products they had. I’m excited to see that I left the store with two bag full of skin products especially clay masks.<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Consider we are in midst of Covid this location is clearly under staff.

The staff is helpful but the lines are long

The bathroom is really dirty and does not look like it has been clean regularly

The return line is so long and only one person staffing all the customers

There is not way that the customer are following 6 ft distance

Management needs help here.  I will not be surprise if this store gets shut down permanently due to violations of lack of following guidelines to prevent Covid

I am certain that I will not come back to this store again.<//Review>< pictures>

Staff was not disciplined and behaved improperly to me and my friend. I strongly believe the people at the billing area should be provided some customer behavior training especially an old man at the billing area. I have had a worst experience today although its new year eve. I would like to recommend the management to hire and train employees to nullify further issues as these will effect the brand of Walmart.< /review>

My appreciation for Walmart keeps growing, love their RV friendly safe parking over night for RVs. Also super convenient to be able to pick up groceries in the morning before you hit the road.</Review>

<Review>Awful none of my debit cards would work even though I had money on all of them. I guess they were being quite patient with us being as though they had to ring up 800 dollars worth of stuff 4 different times. So maybe maybe they should get three stars instead of one. Let me change that before I post. But the store was cleaning, they took way to long to clean a very small bathroom which was quite unacceptable still when I did finally get to use the restroom. Not sure what the man was doing in there for over 20 min but it did not look like he was cleaning, just saying. Also I did not like the idea of not being able to bring my back pack in with me because I use my backpack as purse because I was walking on crutches and couldn't carry a purse so having to leave my purse is not cool at all. The door man how ever was quite nice even when I beeped as I  left the store. He still just waved smiled and told me to have a nice day. That is very good. I hate when they stop me when I beep on my way out of the store.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Very positive experience getting the refund. Due to Covid policies and due to being out of the country, I had not been able to return in time. The supervisor, Marilyn, was kind enough to explore several options to ensure that I got the full refund. She had to try a few workarounds to get me the refund which I appreciated very much. Great customer service and great employee. Thanks.<//text>< user>

During this pandemic, I can say this store is not a good idea to visit if you really want to be safe. No one follows the rules, and there's not even announcements to remind shoppers to follow them. Almost as important of an issue, immediately upon entering i nearly slipped on what I assume was cleaner on a large area in front of where you grab carts. I informed the receipt checker, and he immediately started cleaning it with paper towels, although with no apology or a single word.
I was walking inches from other shoppers very frequently, even though I tried desperately to be patient and keep my distance from everyone, shoppers just walked right toward me without consideration.
People also did not follow the direction of flow in the aisles, and i was too close for comfort, and didn't want to turn around to do the same to someone else in order to avoid it.
Lastly, I saw another very large puddle in the produce area, which is just an accident waiting to happen. I told an employee, and she appeared to leave to get someone to clean it. Although I'm not sure it was even cleaned, as i still saw it there  minutes later.

Hope this helps you stay safe and informed.
I suggest Target, as i remember it being better, though i haven't been in a few weeks now.<//text>

great except for the produce selection and their beer selection I like bottles they only seem to have cans and bottles of six packs or bottles of 24 packs and honestly they didn't have a lot of great value options..< /review>

<Review>Good place to find household stuff, clothes and some food on a budget. Usually is very clean, organized, and quick to check out if you pay thru an automatic cashier. It’s super weird that you have to show your receipt to go out of the place, and also some employees  around trying to help but always are awful.< /Review>< Pictures>

Marilyn customer service manager has the most disrespectful, belligerent, pompous attitude out of anyone I've ever met. I limp in today on my crutches after just having major hip surgery, to find out they don't have any drive buggies for the disabled. Per Peter CSR in this entire store they only have one. Luckily my children were with me and offered to do my shopping with me. I ask to have the manager over to advise that I have given them my permission to use my card. First off I watched her make a pit stop a register to cleab up paper, while knowing that I am injured and waiting for her. She then comes our way passes me up goes to the CSR to ask him what I want and I am standing there. I asked her to come closer more than 15 feet away so I can explained she hesitates. I explain the situation and she doesn't offer help, what she does offer me is an argument in front of a bunch of customers. Even as I attempt to limp off she continues to talk. I then told her about her attitude and she still continues to go back and forth with me. All while I am standing in pain on crutches. Wal Mart are ya serious with putting her in leadership.

<review>Terrible customer service when returning something. The person who did my return was not listening to what I wanted and she did the oposite of what I wanted. I waited half an hour for the managers to just get said they couldn’t do anything about my return. Managers are rude and don’t make anything to keep customer happy.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>A lot of good and healthy items. Stressed out because of the conversation with the chasier . I usually do self check out to avoid them, but today she decided that I didn't scanned a box of milk , so I cancelled all purchase and started again, proved that milk was there! She made me to scan  milk twice on self checkout.  Nothing to add... Sad and stressful 😢< /Text>< Time>

Bought a car battery, put it in the car out in the parking lot and returned the old one in about 45  minutes. The employee that worked on automotive was extremely helpful and got me out fast.<//review>

Walmart is where america shops. Lines can be long during holiday season. Ordering online was easy, prices where pretty good. Pick up at local was confusing, not staff at local stores fault though. Pretty good selection, better than some other local retailers.</review>

This store is ok. I guess service is typical for Walmart. When I asked if they might have stock in the back for some razor blades I got the typical answer of no right away and no attempt  to look it up.</text>

<Review>Just saw the Walmart sign pulled in found out once I enter the store it was not a full Walmart it was just the Walmart grocery Center so I don't know if they should put the name on the sign or what it might be helpful for people that are actually looking for a Walmart that stalks everything that is full size Walmart stock< /Review>< gmapID>

<review>One of their cashiers is very rude. I always have a problem with her whenever she is my cashier. Also, as soon as you walk in, all you smell is farts! It is disgusting and needs a deep cleaning. I would recommend a 7/10 for employees and the awful smell in the entrance.<//review>< Resp>

Employees were very friendly.  Shelves were disorganized and seemed they needed some attention.  Not as much of a  selection compared to other locations.  Seems a smaller store as well.</Review>

Bring your own PPE, none provided. No wipes or hand sanitizers even during a pandemic. Only safety were markings at entry to remind people to keep distance. Positive is less than normal customers fir a Saturday. Supplies seem ok, not sure because we were there for one item and left.< /review>

Considering it is located on Walmart st,  This Walmart is easy to notice from traffic.  There is plenty of space to park. I am unfamiliar with the area I was traveling through and needed diapers in a hurry. Needless to say I was thankful for the parking and the convenient location( very close to the off ramp and noticeable from the freeway). Furthermore, as a father I was relieved to see changing stations in the men's room.</Review>

This is to feedback for the Walmart online. If you find a product in the store, which is cheaper online. There won’t be price matching in the store. You have to order online. Hopefully the system can be more flexible.<//text>

<Review>I was here today around 230pm and there were so many people inside! There were people piled up at the registers and no one was sanitizing carts or self checkout. I don’t even believe the cashiers at regular check stands were doing so. I haven’t been to very many stores and this gave me great anxiety.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The store doesn't do a very good job of maintaining social distance and many of the mask wearers had their nose uncovered.  Racks of clearance clothes were in the aisles making access very difficult.</Text>

I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS WALMART AND HOW THEY NEGLECT OF THEIR FISH. I BROUGHT THIS UP TO THE MANAGER A WEEK AGO ABOUT ALL THE TANKS HAVING 1-4 DEAD FISH SUCKED TO THE FILTERS OR FLOATING AROUND AND THEN NOTICED THIS NEGLECTED BETTA FISH OFF TO THE SIDE THAT STUNK(MANAGER EVEN SAID IT SMELLED BAD). I DECIDED TO RESCUE THE BETTA FISH AND GO TO THE SAME WALMART THIS WEEK AND REALIZED THEY BOUGHT 10 MORE BETTA FISH, 1 ALREADY DEAD ON THE SINK AND 8 IN FILTHY WATER ON THE EDGE OF DYING. THIS COMPLETLY BREAKS MY HEART AND I HAVE TRIED TO SPEAK WITH MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES WHO KEEP TELLING ME TO SPEAK WITH THE MANAGER WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS POINTLESS. WHY PURCHASE SO MANY FISH IF NO ONE BUYS THEM AS WELL AS NO EMPLOYEE IS TRAINED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM PROPERLY. YOU BUY THEM TO DIE ON THE SHELF!!!!!!!! I HAVE CRIED TO A MANAGER ABOUT THIS AND SHE BRUSHED ME OFF AND SAID SHE NEVER EVEN GOES TO THE SECTION OF THE STORE. I HAVE CONTACTED PETA AND WILL GET IN CONTACT WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY WALMART! ANOTHER CUSTOMER HAD THE SAME IDEA AS ME AND WROTE A NOTE TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOUR DAMN FISH. I WILL GET A JOB AT YOUR STORE JUST TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND THAT IS PRETTY SAD IN ITSELF.<//review>

Don’t buy video games from here. I bought a popular PS4 game, took it home and a Star Wars extra features bonus DVD was in the case. Obviously employees doing a switch up taking an expensive video game and replacing with a cheap dvd. Even more blatant, the game was taken from and  purchased from behind the locked security glass , so a customer could not have done that. Insane!!< /Review>

It has good and bad days with their stock.  Lately this store well pretty much all the walmarts havent been stocking the great value heavy duty paper plates and a few other items. Should have more cashiers  when when there is a ton of customer. But this is the store I like the most.  I live in Hayward and I drive to Dublin to shop<//review>

Not clean, you could feel that employees are not happy about their jobs. Higher management needs to take notice of this branch before it becomes worse. Stop hiring people who don't want to work or do not want to be american.< /Review>

One of the nicer one in the area. Love the improvements they've been making, I've been going here nearly 20 years. You can smell the toilets as you walk in though, but at least it will kill your appetite and keep you from buying too much junk food.</review>

Tried to purchase tires. Waited 40 minutes to just know the price of the tire which they haven't listed on them. Worthless auto care center with lazy staff who can't help us with the clearance tire rates. Useless barcode scanner and mindless working help desk staff.
Lazy, careless staff who's just eating walmart salaries with no attention to sales.<//Review>

It's just a normal Walmart. As such, not so great. Electronics section is horrible compared to Target, especially for videogames.<//text>

<text>Big surprise!  The Pickup Kiosk is NOT open during the same hours as the store.  I asked 4 Walmart employees for help in the Pickup Kiosk.  All replied with let me check.  None came back to tell me anything.  After 30 minutes, I finally got a hold of the assistant manager.  He said the only person covering the Pickup Kiosk is on lunch.  He also said he was not trained in the Pickup Kiosk.  Wow, you don’t need much to be an assistant manager.  I would expect, there should always be someone trained in the store for every single department.  Not at this Walmart!  Very poorly managed!</text>< pictures>

I would like rating a store on the basis of following points :
1. Availability of goods and options : no complaint here - plenty of available options
2. Ease of finding something : sections are well documented and signs can be seen from anywhere in the store
3. Overall cleanliness and lighting, parking etc : this store is usually white clean & well lit with lots of parking available
4. Store help & check out handling : I usually do self checkout which is available here. Store folks are helpful and nice.

Overall, a good experience.<//Review>

I was looking for a specific pasta sauce and couldn’t find it I asked an employee named Maria and she said she doesn’t know and said "have you tried looking in the food department" like I didn’t know what department I was in. I was in the skateboard aisle when an male employee told me I wasn’t allowed to pick up the skateboards I was so confused why that was a rule he gave me. I’ve always never had a good time coming here I’ve see vomit in the bathroom bad employees and had returned most of the stuff there that I’ve bought</Text>

<Text>Has the usual Walmart stuff but there is no one to give assistance, I lost a lot of time trying to buy a perfume in the cosmetic section. There is a button there to call for assistance but it is only to fool you, I even talked with employees asking for help but no one could open this ultra safe box full of goods that will never be sold.< /Text>< Pics>

As usual, Walmart is fully stocked with whatever you need. They have great prices of course.  If only I didn't live so far away, I'd buy ice cream every time. Lol.<//text>

<Review>I had a different experience than she of these other reviews on here. Everyone I talked was friendly and smiling. It's been about 2 years since I had been back to the States and was excited to go to Walmart again. The shelves were packed as were the aisles with people ( which is why I have it four stars). That made it a little hard to navigate.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

This Wal-Mart is very clean and organized, employees very helpful and courteous. Glad to see they had a scooter as I'm disabled and it's hard for me to walk around the store. I was able to find several bargains and that's always a plus.<//Review>

Had the WORST experience, got accused of stealing then got double charged for said items. I was accused of stealing 2 pizzas and after REPEATEDLY telling the lady i did in fact pay for it I was made to pay again and surrounded as I payed only to find out I did in fact pay the first time. The staff is rude and unhelpful. I was humiliated by them, I will NEVER shop here again and will strongly advise others to do the same.  So disappointed in this treatment especially from a company that prides itself on customer service and a welcoming environment.< /review>

Overall clean and standard. No issues with staff. I was looking for car snow chains/cables though and they were super low on stock (maybe only ~5 left) and they weren't in my car's size. The attendant at the auto center was super friendly and helpful though and gave suggestions on which Walmart would have more in stock. Parking is decent as long as you're fine with parking further away.</review>

Worst customer service everrrr!!!! They never ever ever answer the phone. If they do they hang up or transfer you to another line thats never answer.. They don't like their jobs. How do you close at midnite but every department is busy 24/7? Out of over 100 employees thats on duty not 1 can answer the phone and help the customers. Close the building down they are useless!!!< /text>

I find that most employees are nice, however the Red Robin reconstruction and noise has been unbearable on the neighborhood.
A lot of weird behavior, driving too fast, people stealing, weird pit pulls and homeless people behind Kohls.<//Review>

<text>Ya know im in this walmart pretty much everyday.

Walmart has always been a good place to do grocery shopping, you can find almost everything here. And prices are usually better and most other stores. The only one drawback usually is the checkout lines.<//Text>

<Review>Good to get basic household things and bike materials such as air pumps, bottle holders, handlebar grips, etc. I got my bike speedometer, air pump, and handlebar grips from here. We also got some basic food for camping for not so much. The cool thing is that they sell fishes and other pet products and basic groceries.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Not very well,went in today to exchange shorts sizes were purchased to small. Had a receipt for partial items couldn't find the receipt for two items perched at a different Walmart. Was asked for my I.D and was questioned about it and my husband was asked my birthday to verify it was me ... why is there a person the front of the store to check your items before you enter if your gonna make accusation that we took the items from the back of the store when we clearly walked in checked with the personnel assigned by Walmart to check all returns.</text>

Nice community store with virtually everything  you want to buy. Take your time moving round the store but helpful staff to assist. Also over head signs detailing what to expect in each airle. Stock is full and some clearance going on. Prices are great comparatively.< /Text>

Always had tough luck finding stuff in aisles even with webpage/app claiming enough quantities available. Staff seems to be lost too in explaining where to find those items. Decent facility though and you get what you pay for. Parking is easy too find too. Easy access to freeway is a plus. Wish they could fix their inventory management system soon and integrate web and brick and mortar stores soon< /Text>

<text>Well it's Christmas Eve and I am doing some last minute shopping. I get to the register and I present my $coupon directly from Walmart. All of the sudden I'm told I can't use this coupon and it's not acceptable at Walmart period well how can that be it's on their site with their name all over the coupon as a matter a fact the link that is provided directs u to Walmart web page. So I asked to see the manager which was a complete joke he without even barely looking at my coupon tells me we don't exept any mobile coupons that they have to be printed out ok fine so I asked him if I printed it out if they would take it then. So once again I am told no even after I was just told that it has to be printed out so as he is saying that he is walking away from me as I am trying to speak with him now I get it it's crazy buzy but I am still a paying customer. Anyways all I am saying is 5min of their time and everything would have been fine. Because that's exactly how long it took for the employee at the Martinez location . So if I could give them no stars I would but they get 1 shiny little star. Put that on your Christmas tree.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Not laid out like most Walmarts, making it confusing. Difficult to find my typical items. Seemed disorganized. It was convenient on one particular day and I won't have a habit of going back. Thankfully.< /Text>

Personally, I enjoy shopping at Wal-Mart. Generally it's well organized and clean. Nice selections and good prices. Crayola art supplies and products are especially well priced at Walmart compared to other stores. As a teacher and tutor of young children for about 18 years, I have noticed that Crayola products are durable and reliable. Wal-Mart stores carry a nice selection of many art and craft supplies by Crayola and Rose Art (and other companies) all at low prices compared to other stores.  One thing that is important to me as a teacher is that I can rely on Wal-Mart to usually have children's art supplies in stock. Most of the time if I need it (and I know they carry it regularly) they have it in stock.</text>

The employees are kind and courteous, even going as far as to give us an additional discount for an item that had a small stain on it. Great prices with many, many choices of products to choose from.</Review>

I wish I can give zero. I wanted to print some photos and create a photo wall in my home to surprise my girl. The system doesn't print full pictures, either the head is cut off in the picture or the legs. I don't know what to do with these half photographs.

I tried for an hour to connect to their machine again and reprint again but I have up as the system just says searching and doesn't move forward from there.

The CSM team could do nothing tooo because as theyoer their policy they don't refund or void prints. I wasted 2 hours in total and came out with utter dissatisfaction.

If you are to waste your time and money for pictures without head you can get prints from this store.

Never coming back again</Review>

Why can’t people write and speak English properly. I’m talking about the customers reviews here. Most of these complaints are stupid and make no sense. Just to complain . At least use proper English. It’s amazing so many people can’t speak or write in our first language.

It’s Walmart. Your a bunch of snobby American nobody’s.< /Text>

<Review>Probably the worst Walmart I've ever been in. The most clueless front end supervisor I've ever met.

Customer service took an excess of 30min just to get an answer that was pretty much not knowing what i was asking for.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< user_id>

Stores don't all carry the same items, and the website has even more variety than the stores. If you find something online, you might want to call the store before going to be sure that they have it.</text></record></dataset><record>

The staff was nice enough...it has a good selection...the staff wasn't very knowledgeable about store products or the whereabouts of the products tho... They didn't have any security at the door which I thought was strange cuz 15 minutes away where I live their is an armed guard at McDonald's lol but they didn't seem like they need security there<//Text>

Terrible customer service. The clerk acted like "I don't care. You go blame on Walmart".
Went  there 4 times for tire replacement, but nothing got done.
1st time: wanted me to wait for 5 hrs, or come next morning.
2nd time: went there 7 am.  Tires out of stock.  Asked me to order online, which I did.
3rd time: the technician was sick.
4th time: the stems or something were not available.  Would be 6 hrs wait.< /text>

Wal-Mart is not known for customer service, but this location takes that literally

I was at the fabric section and waited for 20 minutes for someone to help me. Fabric area is one place they need to have someone at all times, but not here. So, I asked an elderly gentlemen, he said he's not from this Department. I asked him if he can call someone here, he flatly denied, wow ...never happens at target. Then, I asked another lady, she said she'll have someone page the girl. Nothing happened. Then, I found another lady, who was kind enough to go ask another elderly lady. That elderly lady seemed to go off on this young helper as if she asked something wrong, pathetic behavior from that person. Finally, found someone who were able to page, and 30 minutes later the department rep came by, only to say they don't sell the item I was looking for '..LOL<//Text>

Store was good, the cashier was doing whatever he could do to slow down the purchase.  I can only guess so other people would go to another line. And he barley said a word to me. Older man but still obviously stalling.  Very strange.</review>

<review>I  recently came to this location to return my son birthday gift that he recently received from his father . I didn’t have a receipt for this item.I  only wanted to exchange it for something else my son wanted .which was a ps4 game.I spoke with Alex the assistant manager he told me that I couldn’t return it here without a receipt over $50.All I wanted to do was exchange it for a game or something else he wanted. Alex told me there was nothing he can about it.He also told me to asked he dad to remember what day he got it even though it was around the holidays.I said hoe can someone remember the exact day  it was purchased during that time. He wasn’t  very at helpful at all.</review><Gmap_id>0x808fe949eb3c2021:0x16f8e08a95a280ac< /Gmap_id>< resp>

Has a lot of things you need for home and things you need or want. It's a big store so it can be hard to find something.< /review>

It gets crazy here so I like to call in to do item checks so I don't have to walk into the chaos for nothing. I don't know if they are short-staffed but I can't ever get through to someone there! So annoying. I have called Livermore Walmart and there is always someone answering the phone.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>It's a Wal-Mart, hasn't everyone been in one?  This one is a smaller older one but it has been remodeled several times as they increase the grocery section which now has some fresh produce and bakery items.

Always overcrowded and understaffed. Out of i believe 16 registers there was 2 registers plus express lane open. The lines were insane. The isles also seem to to be getting more narrow and every inch of space is crammed with more product.</Review>

It is an okay Walmart if you need something quickly, but restocking of certain items happens only every (other) month. So it's quicker to go to another store or order it online< /Review>

The cashier who served me was kind, efficient and made me feel "come back". Usually I am satisfied with my purchases but today when I cut into the watermelon it was all mush and I had to throw it out.   What a waste of time and money.< /Review>

We always enjoy going to shop Walmart at Milpitas store, the staff are always very friendly and helpful.
Now we just moved to Dublin, and like to try the opthomatry department to get some new glasses.
I called the eye department this morning, the lady who answered the phone had an attitude, she had a very unfriendly tone and seems she didn’t care about the customers when I told her I was going to make an appointment for eye examination, unfortunately I didn’t ask her name.
I called the department again try to make a complaint to the supervisor,a different staff answered the call, she wasn’t any better than the previous employee. It made me really upset!
My question for the store manager at this Dublin store is:
1. Are all your employees in this store trying to send all your customers away?
2. Are all your employees in your store were trained to be so rude to anyone who want to get a pair of eye glasses??
3. Is this kind of attitude the principle of treating your customers to show that you don’t care about your business ?

I could had given your store a -1 star if there was one.

Thanks for the rudeness of your staff in the opthomatry department!?????< /review>

I had a photo center ordered cancelled after I was told it was lost. 9 month later they called me to pick it up, and they recharged almost the full amount despite it being 9 month late. And if I didn't pay, they were going to throw it away.<//text>

I went in looking for a vacuum that was on sale. It took me like 20 minutes to find the right one and countless reps walked by without assisting. When I finally found it, I went to checkout, and that took forever even though the people in front of me didn't have that much stuff. When they scanned the vacuum, it was $90 higher than price where it was listed and it wasn't in the wrong place because I triple checked it all before leaving the aisle, so I asked the cashier if the one I was looking at on the app wasn't the same as the one I had and she barely glanced and said, "no." No offer to price check, no closer look at the product and what I was looking for, so I started to say, "oh I'll go look again then" and she rolled her eyes at me! I called her out and she denied it. I try to be respectful and not give them more work than they already have to do and they disrespect me? Won't see me there again.<//review>

<Text>I went to walmart today to buy my girlfriend perfume as part of her bday present. Their cologne/perfume area has a glass case covering it and has a help button for assistance which I pressed 5 times I asked three different employees for help 1 guy who was stocking shelves which he told me to ask up front with someone with a yellow vest and 2 woman who were wearing the yellow vest said they have their boss come and help but no came. I waiting 30 minutes and just left. If anyone from this Walmart is reading this please inform your management that they need to train better customer service.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This was one of the worst Walmart Supercenters I've been at in the Bay Area. There was no fresh produce in the fresh produce section, the walkways between aisles were super narrow too.
On top of that, they we're literally out of cashiers.< /Text>

Awful customer service.. I waited 45 minutes just to have an item unlocked and when I respectfully asked a passing employee for help or someone that could help she threw up her arms and said something under her breath as she walked away... I understand people have bad days.. I have them all the time and I work customer service but I feel that was uncalled for..< /review>

Great place, I shop fairly early to get a handicapped parking spot. After 10am they are usually all taken.
Employees are helpful, even getting things off the shelf. Other day the employee walked with me until we found were the moth balls were in store.</Text>

Ok. So as far as Walmart locations go, this one certainly meets my expectations. I go to Walmart when I’m looking for basic products at a great price. You certainly will get what you pay for, so don’t come here expecting gold silverware or mink coats.</review>

Getting oil change so I went shopping around waiting for my name to be called. Never called after 2 hours..when I went back to service area  ,my car was done an hour ago. They never called my name. Lady apologized but I guess it's not a priority to let customers know when they are done servicing your car. Not busy at all on this Tuesday morning . Fyi in case anyone's in a hurry.</review>

The store is a typical WalMart, except the customers here are not nice nor do they smile back when smiled at. They also have absolutely no problem being in the way and far be it that they would move out of the way for anyone. Not a happy camper with this Walmart!< /text>

<Review>The best assistance I ever experienced in any Walmart ever. I needed a laptop and the person in the department came right over to me to see if I had any questions as the little piece of paper gives very little onfo. The guy actually knew something about the products and therefore got the sale.< /Review><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Typical Walmart. Well kept and clean. The security guard was constantly eyeballing me and followed me and my sister in law around. It was obvious we were stopping in so I could buy a pair of pants to change into as mine got caught on a splinter in a door frame and completely ripped up the sides. We were only visiting the area and were not close enough to our hotel that we could drive back and I could change. I bought a pair of sweat pants for a couple bucks and went into the bathroom to change while my sister in law got a coffee from the McDonald's Donald's inside the store. This self inflated over entitled guard followed me right to the bathroom door. It clear we werent there to steal anything as she followed us through the checkout line before the bathroom.</review>

All the good prices you'd expect at Walmart, but parking is often full near the front, even disabled spots are always full,which is hard when I bring a disabled family member. Bathrooms need to be cleaned more often. Usually sufficient number of cashiers, typically a reasonable wait to pay. Dressing room attendant is unfriendly & spent a lot of time talking with other employees nearby while I waited to try on some pants. They were talking about another coworker, very unpleasant & rude. I go for the prices, not the service or "ambiance" so my expectations aren't too high. Good location off 580 at Hacienda exit.< /review>

I only go to Walmart because it's cheap. The customer service is terrible and they always run out of stuff. They also need to provide their employees with a break room since they all hang out in the McDonald's. They eat their own food from home in the McDonald's. I gave them 2 stars for the low prices.< /review>

This is the 2nd time as happened and their justification was that it's their policy when the person who works in that area clocks off the fitting rooms close.  Well to state the obvious, you're an employee, and YOU are currently working this area why can't you stand here and help me. That might sound entitled but when you have a store full of employees looking at their phones someone should be willing to help. 3 people told me I couldn't use the fitting room because there is no one working in that area, and all I'm thinking is are you not working and are you not in this area? Horrible service it took 1 of those employees complaining about me complaining to a manager for the manager to stand there while I used to fitting room.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fe949eb3c2021:0x16f8e08a95a280ac</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Worst customer service experience of my lifetime. Website said products were available that were not. Called many times to check on product availability and was told that "everyone in that department is on lunch" and was hug up on multiple times. Rude employees and no help whatsoever. Thanks again Walmart.</text>

Always regretted doing pics here!  I got my 2nd child's 6 month baby pic done here (my 1st was done at Sears) and they both hang side by side in the hall.  Compared to the other one, the Walmart one is faded, dull in color, and there's no shine to her face.  Her smile's not even as genuine! Biggest regret of my life with kid stuff!</text>

<text>It's always a freak show in most Walmarts and this one is no exception. That goes for the customers and the staff. Today we yet again had a couple of employees that seemed dismissive and eager to brush us off and get back to whatever they were doing. We can't remember the last time we had a good experience at this store. Oh... Except the eye doctor. They were cool.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Lp followed me all over the store for absolutely no reason Hella odious like... Dude was a white male about 5.10 maybe 6 ft at the most white male with very identifying large ear gauges harassed me and told me to leave for no apparent reason........ Usually I would just let it go but then the next time I was there the automotive associate was super rude to me....it was the guy who ran the. Counter he had to do was let me out of the door I had already paid for my purchase in the pharmacy i was in a hurry to get my diabetic mother her insulin before she had to go to the hospital and he couldn't even push one button so I can get out pathetic really if you ask me all the way up front taking me another 15 minutes to get all the way to my car that was parked by the Automotive really I think they should be coached or fired or anything endangering people's lives it's not a funny business especially for something as Petty and weak as pushing one little button who needs people like that< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Do you want to get a sample how hell will be when you die? Just step into this walmart and you'll get a free sample of hell. Lines are long and no one wants to help you. Went in there to return something, and was told I could not. Item new never open. I was like what?! Why? " B/C its our policy" I called BS on that and had  manager come by. Manager confirm with me that the rep was full of it. After the manger told him its fine for me to return the item the rep again came up with a reason not to refund me.

Staying in Pleasanton from out of town... This store is absolutely aweful!!! Today the entire store is out of bags. Not even a bag to buy unless you go to the purse section! Unbelievable... They said well you should carry them in your car... I'll make sure to tell the car rental company that apparently in Pleasanton you should equip your rentals with shopping bags.< /Review>

<Review>I bought an air mattress here that I tried to use the same day and it leaked. I tried to take it back when I was told that you can not return air mattresses once opened. I asked where it says that and the lady told me online. So I asked if I have to look up every purchase I make online to find out the return policy prior to purchasing in the store. She said yes that is where you find the information. Then, a low level manager came over to tell me that I should know that you can’t return air mattresses that have been open even though there is no written policy posted anywhere near the air mattresses in the store. Not that it will do much, but I will never give Walmart another dollar of my money.</Review>< username>

<rating>4</rating><text>As often is the case, it took awhile to find an employee to help me to locate something. When I found someone, they told me wrong isle. And the next employee told me wrong isle also. So---- because I didn't have all day, I went looking myself. Big difference between isle 8 and isle 23. And also isle 10 and isle 23. Isle 23, lowest shelf- on rear of shelf -and in corner is where I found the product. That was some  adventure!  But other than  employee " help", this store is better than some other Walmarts I've been in in the Bay Area.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

My go to place for potting soil & inexpensive plants.  While I'm there I normally pick up a few other household items too.

Unfortunately their internet sales pickup service is horrible.  I've had multiple occasions where I've had to wait over 30 minutes to get helped.

I now use the Neighborhood Walmart for my internet sales pickup location.  The service at that store is much better.< /Text>

Come here for the cheap prices, that's about it. Besides the usual stuff, Walmart actually has a pretty extensive automotive section where you can get good prices on a wide variety of motor oil, batteries and even coolants.< /review>

<Review>Train your people! I had to stand in line twice to wait for two different "customer service" (i use thatnterm vety loosely) reps, neither of who had ANY idea what to do. Then the manager was called, again, I wait. Then he says there is nothing he can do, no personality, no apology, nothing. NEVER again will we step foot into Wal-Mart. As a business owner, it disgusts me when there is this lack of training and lack of policies and procedures.</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>The store seems to have the attitude "we have more important things to do than help customers at the checkout."  There is far more attention by employees getting stock on the shelves than opening a second or third register when a line of more than 7 people forms.  The person watching the door seemed clueless and very slow to respond to my complaint.  When I asked for the name of the manager on duty she refused to give me her name - saying she didn't want her to get in trouble.  Then she asked another employee with the badge name of SAIF if he could help and I asked him if he could give me the name of the manager on duty and he also refused.  I said fine I would put this review in his name as the person I find responsible for having to wait 20 minutes in line at the register (before I was even able to put a single item on the belt.)  This is my second poor review of this Walmart and the failures of the management to address the need to monitor the front of the store to ensure customers are helped in a timely manner.  For the love of Pete.  This is retail not rocket science its RETAIL 101.  The Walmart management at this location needs customer focused training and that training needs some serious secret shopper visits as well as some of the corporate Walmart management visits to confirm the training is being followed.  This would have been a zero star rating if GOOGLE allowed it.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

The return desk is even worse . Friendly people but they work slow and don't care if they have a line at ther casher and work slow with no means of working faster. I was talking to the manager and he didn't even seem to care of my issue that I was trying to take care of. Customer service is everything for a store and they failed bad.<//Text>< Pics>

As always worst customer experience.  Worst store pickup experience and didn't get help in electronics.

Another bad experience today...Beware Walmart shoppers... walmart is the first company I encountered which is not rendered the return policy they promised.   I bought some things a month back and when I went to store to return items, they didn't accept.   Reason the manager quoting is so silly, that they don't have that stock,  so they can't take returns.   I had even receipt too.. I asked her,  while buying also I checked for return policy,  they said three months with receipt,  how can you change now.. get answer is simple we have right thi change on our own.. it's updo us.. so rude.. very bad experience.. am frequent visitor to Walmart.. attest this incident,  I may not go again..<//review>

Started to go in the first door we came to and an employee yells we cannot come in that door, but it was not obviously marked exit-only. Then, they check your receipt when you do exit to make sure you paid for everything in your cart. Customers in Pleasanton must have very sticky fingers!< /text>

Supply and demand dont go
Buy a fan hardley any.......
Dont go to buy tires no help.
This store needs serious help
The onlybhelp i got was a lady
Named safari all the othe employees beside her was the
Poor cashier. By the way they should have chairs or stools
For the cashiers have to stand
All day.
A may because i awaited 45 min. For a handicapped cart.
Not enough for the shoppers.< /Review>

Walmart is walmart. Every one I talked to was pleasant some even said hi as we passed Then there  was the checker who was not good or friendly did nor know how to bag
You do not stuff a bag when there is three bags and  question you because you have a frezor bag with you bags This one CS rep gets a minus 10. Msnager was advised of the problem.<//review>

This Walmart location is relatively big and has all the products that one could find at any other Walmart location. The establishment itself does seem slightly run down and maintenance does not seem to be top priority. There also seems to be a sewer issue which has been present for years at the front of the store. When you walk in, it most likely will smell real bad. Overall though, the store gets the job done like any other.<//text>

<Review>This Walmart is not the place to go. Go to anyone but this one especially the tire & lube service. My car was there over 3 hours and 40mins and it still wasn't ready for just an oil change and tire rotation. I asked to be compensated for this bad service and a head shake & shoulder shrug from employees and assistant manager. I will write corporate. Just be warned.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
Been in several times, there's huge holes in the ceiling place looks like it's falling apart.  Went in to cash my payroll check (which I have done before at this Wal-Mart as well as many others) and some older Indian guy behind the customer service counter said "no no before you sign the check let me look at it to see if its good" so he stares at it for about 5 minutes and says "no I cannot accept check" as well as several other stupid excuses why he could not cash it which were all BS because I used to work for Bank of America so I know how check clearing procedures work so I ask for the manager and some guy named "Sam" and I hand him the check then he looks at it again and says he can't accept it either.  Because of the time (5:30pm) he cannot check to see if the funds are good and he never heard of the Bank. Really Sam? You never heard of Bank of the West? What do you live under a rock? He criticized me for laughing at him because he insisted it was a local bank that was located in Modesto (the banks address on the check)  So I'm thinking to myself "they got this moron Managing this place? No wonder its such a dump! He seemed a little slow to me, kinda downsy.

Further more the check was only for $400, not for a million so I don't see what the problem was.  Why the hell do they have a check cashing service that can't cash checks after the bank is closed? Hell if I could have well then of coarse I would have rather went to the Bank than this dump!<//review>

I had seen many walmarts, so far the worst store I had been to. It stinks right when you enter the store or while leaving. I am smelling this bad smell for the past 6 months at least. I would prefer target instead. Walmart should look at the quality of the target stores.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Seriously, a Walmart that isn't open 24 hours? Worthless. That's one of the key features, and doesn't have it... That's like KFC without chicken. Or Macy's without sales. Crime rate is pretty decent here, so it's not like they really have to worry about that. I mean, it's the friggin Tri-Valley area.  The town is considered generally affluent, the median income is over 100k per year, and heck, not only are we getting another Whole Foods but the Safeway is open 24 hours. What gives?<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
This was the worst experience I have ever had at Wal-Mart.  I had been shopping for almost half an hour and was in an aisle to get some Tupperware. There were restocking carts on both sides of the aisle and I had to leave my cart outside. After a minute when I come out almost all of my stuff had been taken by someone and other stuff put in it's place.  At least you should ask around before deciding a cart was just left by someone. All my time wasted.<//Review>

The pharmacist at Wal-Mart in plesanton is extremely judgemental and treats different people differently according to what they look like and what ethnicity they are. She refused to help me with no explanation other than saying she didn't like the way I look because I "look poor" and if I didn't like it to call 1 800 RITE AID and laughed. My elderly aunt ended up in the emergency room due to this woman's disregard for any type of ethics or decency. It is disgusting and scary that she is even allowed to work in such a position<//Text>

Wal-Mart Auto service technicians could not care less about customers, presumably, because nobody is being held to account for what they do and how they treat customers.  .  I went there for  the flat tire service and ask them to put the spare tire back to where it should be, in my case it is under the middle of the van.  When I got my van back after 4 hours waiting, the careless technician place the spare tire in the back of my van.  So, when I asked the technician to put it back to the bottom of the van, she said that I could do it myself.  Seriously?  It goes underneath a van, not in the trunk.  When I insisted that she needed to finish the job, she gave me a cold look. when she finished what she was supposed to finish, she just walked away without a word.  This is the attitude of Wal-Mart these days. Wake up Wal-Mart.<//Review>

Let me be clear , I am giving this location 2 stars when compared to other Walmarts. If I wasn't comparing it to a Walmart this place would get 0 stars. This was one of the dirtiest Walmart's I've ever set foot in and the staff was rude. They also were out of stock on most the sale items we came in for. Worst Wal-Mart ever.< /review>

I went there on Sunday morning 8/16/15 to do an oil change for my van, drove 20 miles from my home, arrive there around 9 AM just to find out their auto department is closed due to ALL employees called off for the day.
The manager told me there's a chance they will open that day if the employee of the next shift can come, so I left my car and they told me they will call me back to let me know.
No body call me that day so I call them, got disconnected 4 times until they told me the auto dept is closed, and I asked if I can pick up my car, the operator told me they closed and don't have the key so I can pick up tomorrow.
Next day Monday, too busy with work, Tuesday I called in the afternoon they told me they cannot do my car since I have to sign the paperwork for that day even I did on Sunday, I asked if they can fax it over, they said no.  And I have to pick up my car and they didn't do anything on my car even I left it there for 3 days.
They really make it look like it's my fault that I left the card there and it's not their fault if the auto dept is closed no body say sorry or apologizing.
They don't car about customer service and no exemption even I left my car there for 3 days and they still don't want to do my car even I told them I can sign anything they want when I pick up the car.
The worst Walmart and I will not do any business with Walmart anymore.
The funny thing is when I pick up my car everybody call me "hon" which is weird, since only my wife call me that.</review>

This Walmart is better than most of the others I've been to and it's very clean. Most of the price check computers work as well.</review>

It's just a depressing store.  When you walk in it smells like a dirty bathroom right at the entrance.  It's always messy looking.  The employees  seem to be depressed and unlearned about their departments. (Fish, Paint...at the moment the paint mixer has been broken for two months at least but when it's working, nobody seems to know how to use it....if you can find someone to even ask about it.)

The place is just really, (and sorry to use this word but it's appropriate here), ghetto for and area like Pleasanton.  Target is a thousand times better!< /Text>

I havent even been to this walmart and i can tell the employees here dont give a damn. After dropping my call twice, the employee, without any apology whatsoever, told me the item was out of stock without even checking. Didn't even offer if the item will be restocked, an alternative or anything that would require her to work a little more...ugh.</Text>

Unfriendly staff, with mean attitude towards customers. Visited this store a few times and experience was the same every time. Also, witnessed fellow customers being humiliated. I prefer to avoid shopping at this store,  unless mandatory.< /text>

We bought tires for our service van back in july/aug 2012 had walmart service & change our tires.. Had van since 2000year first mechanic to put correct tires on , as we needed tires that could support the weight of our gear... Did a fantastic job.. :-) customer service was awesome too.. had some good luck with employees really caring enough to sell u what u need, not which isnt always at walmart... Keeps me beiing a returned happy customer...  Fyi  Store closes during week at 11pm not 11:59pm</Review>

Feeling so bad of being cheated.
That guy charged me for three extra items which I didn't buy at all. He took an advantage of me being in hurry with kids.
Not sure what to do now. I m already back home.<//review>

It's a generic Walmart location. We didn't see any PM-wearing or camoed Hillbillies while they, though, so came away a little disappointed.<//Review>

Honestly, it's a typical Walmart. Things are scattered everywhere, unpleasant smells as soon as you enter, and it's crowded with people that don't know where they are at. We haven't used the registers, but they are constantly filled with lines.

We only use it for the pharmacy occasionally and the place always feels like a mess.<//review>

On weekends it quite crowded, however people are nice, both staff and shoppers. You can find most of the stuff, however electronics section is not that big, so is the hardware/home section.< /review>

I am not a fan of Walmart. I usually only visit when I have to. This one is no different than the others. Dirty, unorganized, rude staff, and it smells like feet.< /review>

This Walmart does not allow you to return goods if you lost the receipt. That is actually against the Walmart policy.</Review>

This Walmart is low quality, it is too hot in summer (I guess the AC is off to save money). When I went to buy avocados in the fruit area there were no bags left at all so I couldn't select any fruit. Some of the shelves were completely empty, like no orange juice left. A limited selection of substantial food like meat and potatoes etc. And in general the store feels messy, unorganized and dingy, not a pleasant shopping experience.</Text>

<review>Terrible Walmart, hate to be negative, but they are always lacking in products, common things like bananas, or apples, chocolate chips, meat selection is poor, the cheese I bought was all moldy when I opened it at home, not enough cashiers, etc etc. I suggest you don't waste your time going to this Walmart, you will just be disappointed.</review>< rating>

(Translated by Google) Relative to other Walmart. The games here are a bit expensive! No discount... There are discounts on the Victory Android side

<text>(Translated by Google) I went to buy shoes today, but I don’t have any oranges to sit down and try the shoes. It is estimated that some people will not be allowed to sit and rest in the store for a long time, so that it will be hard for people who really want to buy shoes!

今天去買鞋，但没有任何橙子可以坐下试试鞋.估计是不给一些人在店内长坐休息，这样就苦了真正想買鞋的人!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) A quite famous chain store, the price is medium to low. Many elderly staff feel quite caring.

<review>(Translated by Google) The store is nice, but the department of fresh fruits, vegetables and greens is very small, as well as the store has very small aisles between the rows with the goods, it is difficult to move very closely with the wheelbarrow for the goods.

(Original)
Магазин хороший, но очень маленький отдел свежих фруктов, овощей и зелени, а также в магазине очень маленькие проходы между рядами с товаром, очень тесно с тачкой для товара трудно перемещаться.< /review><gmap_id>0x808fe949eb3c2021:0x16f8e08a95a280ac<//gmap_id>< time>
