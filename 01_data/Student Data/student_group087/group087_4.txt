My go to place for affordable and authentic Italian food. Their pizzas are the right thickness and right level of crunch. Desserts are good too.< /Text>

Portions are generous and delicious! Pasta was cooked just right. Fettuccine Alfredo had a generous amount of nutmeg, just the way I like it. Thanks!< /Text>

Solid pizza joint. We've ordered from here numerous times and have never been disappointed. The pizzas are big and taste like pizza...so good job Two Guys!

They usually have a good special with a pizza and wings. Their wings always hit the spot. They aren't the best wings I've ever had BUT they are delicious. They offer a variety of wing sauces. You know when you just want some decent wings? This is the place.

Their customer service is always enjoyable. The dozen times (or so) we've ordered from here, the order taker is pleasant and doesn't make you feel rushed and they always make recommendations. The drivers who deliver are always nice and go over the order.

This is our go to home delivery pizza spot.

Highly recommend :)< /review>

I am a former small business owner. In this day and age you would think they would welcome business. I was treated rudely when I ordered delivery, almost a burden. Before COVID they were my "go to" for pizza. I am gonna "go to" somewhere else.<//text>

Outstanding customer service. I called them last night with an incredibly complicated order for a large family event. The person who answered the phone spent fifteen minutes with me and did her best to make sure she was taking down the order correctly. Their estimated delivery time was accurate and the pizza tasted pretty good too. I am very impressed.< /Text>

<Text>Pizza was cold. I literally picked up inside waiting until it was done it was cold. When wslking by the liquor store I seen roaches and then I was hesitant to eat in the plaza entirely. But I already ordered the pizza. Unfortunately if one place has roaches prob the entire plaza is ingested IMO. Anyways we came home we had to rewarm pizza's and cheese sticks. For 45$ that's not cool.</Text><userid>101183820124971482720</userid>< Rate>

I am a regular GrubHub customer,  and was initially impressed with the prompt delivery and taste of the foods. It has been over a year, and I have gotten more acquainted with their menu, and have not been disappointed. Recently, an error was made on my order, and the Manager, Jerry, was very generous in his response and offered a generous credit. Today, I spoke to Marilyn and ordered again, and she had all of the notes and credit ready. This is a 180 degree treatment to the rude management at Bonnie B's BBQ on Lake Ave, who hung up on me after telling me "they don't need my business." Two Guys from Italy, will have a regular customer in me, simply because they know how to treat their customers.<//text>

I had the meat ravioli and my daughter had the stuffed calzone.  We ordered through grub hub and it was delicious.  Only draw back was they missed the add salad with the ravioli.  I would order again.  Affordable, delicious Italian food is hard to find.< /Review>

They were great and had great prices/deals for ok pizza, but seems like it's gotten dramatically worse lately for deliveries. Recently ordered pizza at 3 on a Sunday and didn't get my pizza until 8pm after calling twice to ask where my pizza was - it seemed like each time they didn't even have my order started or anything. By the time the pizza arrived I'd already gotten food from elsewhere and the pizza that came wasn't at all what I ordered - not even close, and was just so bad.< /Text>

<Review>Just ordered from Door Dash and 1/2 of my order was missing but I got charged for all of it.  I called Two Guys and the person who answered the phone said, "You ordered ravioli and wings right?".  I didn't tell him what I ordered, and he hadn't checked the ticket.  Yes.  I did order spaghetti, ravioli, wings, and calzones.  1/2 the order was prepared and delivered.  The restaurant charged me $44.  Door Dash charged me $57.00.  When I called Two Guys, he said, "You need to take it up with Door Dash.  Your ticket only says ravioli, spaghetti, two salads, and one calzone".  My question is, how did he know I ordered wings if I didn't tell him and that wasn't on the ticket!? Anyhow.  When I called the restaurant to resolve my issue, I just got a blow off - "you need to take it up with Door Dash".  So basically, "I got mine!  Too bad so sad customer!".  Never ever ordering again from a place that is so dismissive of their customers when they call for help.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>This is the best pizza Ive ever had. Hubby and I are visiting from SF and got back to our hotel late Saturday night, hungry. This place was near us and open so we gave it a try. Despite being 10mins to close when we picked up our pizza, the staff was kind and courteous. They were incredibly helpful and hospitable. The pizza was piping hot by the time we got to the room to eat it. The perfect amount of cheeae, sauce, and toppings. With service and pizza this great we will definitely come back.<//Text><name>Ashley Custer< /name><rating>5</rating></record>

<Time>1477181391226< /Time><text>I ordered food from grub hub for delivery from Two Guys. My food was 15 min over the time they said it would take and I called to see what was happening. Two Guys gave no apology and was very short with me with "it's on it's way!" after asking my name and phone number. I waited 20 more min then called again as it was getting close to 2 hour since I ordered. The manager was summoned and he put me on hold for 5 min only to tell me that my order was not made. All I got was a sorry and a goodbye. The next day I am now having to try to get my refund as they only refunded the food - not the tax, delivery charge, or tip. Grub Hub tried to help me but could not get them to fix it. We have ordered before and had no problem - but never again. Rude customer service and bad business practices. I am still trying to get my money back.<//text><user_name>David Huber<//user_name><userid>105409081534074171254</userid><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I placed an order for 16” pizza they give me 10” pizza when I call they don’t even offer to fix the order after stating it was his mistake. Insisted I call Postmates for a refund rather than he fix it. Terrible service. Too bad because the food not bad but I will not go back. Luckily blaze pizza is nearby.</text>

Ordered a Philly Cheese Steak.  Meat was overcooked and dry.  Salad or chips were supposed to be included, received neither!  The chicken on the Caesar salad had no flavor, plus dry.
Called and  complained  All I received was an apology!  Not that we'll replace your order.  Was told, we'll make it up to you next time!  Next time??< /Text>

When he brought the food back - no silverware, no napkins, no paper plates to split the salad for 2. Not only that, but I ordered the calzone, a vegetarian one, and sure enough HUGE LUMPS OF MEAT in my calzone - and not the vegetables that I ordered. Maybe they are good if you can eat there, but this was an expensive mess. How do you not include a fork and napkins with pasta dishes?!< /review>< Response>

Multiple late orders from this place. The pizza is decent but with deliveries taking more than 2hrs I will not be ordering from them ever again. I was occassional customer, but that has ended. How are you still in business?< /Text>

My favorite place to go to for authentic Italian dining. They make everything fresh so be prepared to wait.</Text>

<text>Ordered for delivery as a first time customer. Pizza arrived very late. Was ordered at 10:45 and told it would arrive by 11:30. At 12:00 called to check on status and was told it should be here any minute. Pizza showed up at 12:15.
Pizza was hot but not tasteful . . . little to no marinara sauce. Hawaiian pizza with minimal topping . . . we are talking 2-3 pineapple per slice and same with the ham.</text>< Time>

Don't bother with delivery. You're going to get your food way late. Parking here is very difficult, so unless you're within walking distance, lunch time is a no-go. Not an easily navigable location for wheelchairs (pretty sure it's not ADA compliant). Quality is low, especially for the price.<//text>

<review>UPDATE (5/16/2021): A month after this review and two weeks after the leasing office claimed they had reissued my check I have still yet to receive my security deposit.

I am writing this review solely to echo others tales of caution with the irresponsible apartment management team at Santana Heights.

I moved out of my apartment on Feb 14, 2021, and never received an itemized statement or my security deposit back. I made multiple good faith attempts to work with the leasing office, but despite some empty apologies and excuses how I should've been refunded but wasn't, no one in the office did anything to get my money back or provide a single update. It is over 2 months since I moved out now and Santana Heights continues to illegally hold my deposit without cause.

I am consulting with an attorney to get my deposit back and additional damages awarded.

Management was always hard to contact before the pandemic--2020 was even worse and things don't seem to have improved in 2021.<//review><response>{'time': 1618874663124, 'text': "Hi Robert Wertheim, we can assure you that we do not find this acceptable, and we appreciate you allowing us to address the situation. We have forwarded the security deposit refund statement to you electronically to ensure you are in receipt and we're happy to reissue a check for your deposit if the delay continues.  We'll continue to stay in communication with you."}<//response></record>

We have been living here over an year. Great location (which is why we are here) but terrible terrible maintenance, esp. in the townhomes. Stay away if you are expecting to be taken care of once you move in. We have had a leak followed by a sewer line back into the kitchen for 7 days and management didn't treat it as an emergency.

The house smells like a sewer, no dishwasher or cooking possible. Highly unhygienic and maintenance sent a person only on day 6 when I threatened to send a legal notice. The maintenance guy said he is one person managing hundreds of properties (!) and was dealing with other issues which are also urgent. Says a lot about quality of construction/infrastructure, doesn't it.

Anyways, he tried to do what he can. When he realized that external vendor is needed, management refused to pay overtime and it got pushed to day 7. Even then, no repairs as of 5pm on day 7. Still waiting, and posting this review hoping that someone cares about their reputation, which frankly is non-existing for anyone who lives here...

Photo attached to show what is NOT an emergency according to the manager.<//review>

< Review>
Upon looking for a nice place to move in the Bay Area I stumbled upon Misora Santana Row. I ended up calling and taking the free tour. I spoke with Stephanie the apartment manager here and she is so very nice and accommodating. She showed me the place and told me about pet friendly community. Everyone here is so nice and very quiet. I am very pleased with how everything has gone. Whenever I reach out to Stephanie the property manager with a question she is quick to respond and is very helpful she is a great manager and I appreciate all of her support and the rest of the misora staff as well. Overall this has been a great experience highly recommended.

<text>I’m reviewing again publicly because the office has been no help at all. I’ll urge anyone I can to avoid this place at all costs. MONTHS prior to moving out, I gave them a forwarding address and requested to be present at the walk through. Despite attempts to schedule a time to be there, no one would schedule time to do a walk through so I was never given an opportunity to resolve any issues prior to moving out (because How would I be able to predict what they were?!) I never received my deposit- but I also NEVER received an itemized statement within the legal timeframe. Upon reaching out to them, I was sent an invoice with ridiculous charges and after MANY attempts to resolve this - No response. I’ve already consulted with an attorney and everyone agrees that Santana Heights is keeping my deposit in bad faith. The only way to get a response is to file a claim in court. I’ve never had this issue with a landlord before and I’m appalled at the lack of service and professionalism at Santana Row.<//text><user>103309261103810086149<//user><Date>1620432519833</Date>< name>

<Time>1611366093522<//Time><rating>1<//rating><Text>I was told that the amenities were opening up the following week so I put a $1k deposit down on a place online.  I went the week after that with my children to see it and found out that the amenities are not open except the pool which is limited to 5 people at a time, and was then told it was not know when they would open.  I had not signed a lease yet, so called to tell them almost 3 weeks before the lease was supposed to start to tell them I no longer wanted to live there based on the amenities not being open.  They punted me over to the community manager, Stephanie, that closed my case without a refund and without following up with me.  I called back, they admitted they told me that but refused to give me my deposit back even though they rented the place!  Not surprising considering the many reviews on Yelp about this corporation keeping security deposits even when the place was left in perfect condition and the way they treat people poorly in general.  I am appalled by the lack of ethics, morality and empathy of this money grubbing corporation and will be taking legal recourse unless my money is refunded.< /Text>< pictures>

Main main main reason I am writing this review is because of our parking issues!
Been here almost 2 years lease is due soon and can’t wait to move out!
Management is terrible they never contact you back I’ve emailed and left several messages in person and over the phone with the office and none of the managers there bother to call back!

I’ve lived in several apartment complexes and when you have 1 parking space reserved to you it means it is your parking and any other cars will be towed away ASAP and it happened.
But HERE? We live in a gated complex in Santana Heights where we have 1 parking space to us per tenant as indicated in our lease, No matter of the time of the day or night we must have 1 empty for us when we come home!

Many many many times random people will come through the gate and park like you can even have bunch of friends come take your parking for hours without being towed away! When We have contacted the securities they say we get orders from the office and we’re not allowed to tow cars unless we have logged the same random vehicle parked more than 3 times in our system and I’ve showed them same cars being logged into their system then they refer you to the office again and they would only come put a tow sign but again will never be towed, It’s all a show!

They keep putting citations on the cars over and over which is pointless.
Office doesn’t care AT ALL no matter of how many times you complain they say we can’t just tow cars even if it is a private parking and even if we’re paying 5000 rent can’t even have a parking space.
I don’t know for what reason they don’t tow them who knows!

We have another parking for tenants in a different building top of the security office and the gym which we also have 1 space reserved to us they have a big tow away sign at the entrance and when you tell them how come you don’t tow cars they come up with same weird odd reasons so what is the point of the sign? And how come you don’t put that same big sign for this parking?

If you work night shifts do NOT live here as construction is never ending here!
They start at 7 am extremely early and they told me they have indicated the start time in our lease literally at 7 am!!
Some workers will talk so loud early mornings careless about people resting.

Many break ins happened here and also a few bicycles stolen from our secured gated complex in a luxury Santana Row including mine for 1500.00!!
Where are all the securities? How come they won’t even bother to look at the cameras when we complain?

Water shutoffs;
Used to shut the water off 3-4 times a month and now reduced to once or twice a month which is inconvenient and this is been on going for almost 2 years now!

Neighbors in general have complained as well and at the end life goes on with the same issues!< /Text>

<Text>Diana at the concierge service has been one of the greatest experiences at Santana Row. If you need something she gets it done, one time I really wanted to go to one of the parties but had not rsvpd on time... and an hour before it started she called me and got me in- and it was worth it. I definitely recommend utilizing her services when you need something here.

<Text>The management is incompetent. I have lived in a lots of different complexes and this is my first bad review. I just hope this helps someone from dealing with headaches that I and some other residents had to endure. A good apartment and location is only worth it if the management is making the experience pleasant.

I had read reviews about management being unorganized, but I thought it couldn't be that bad, but it was worse than I imagined. It also did impact my quality of life here more than I thought. Moving in, they lost my deposit checks. Moving out, they lost my notice. You may have to hire a lawyer just like me to avoid getting frustrated by the management and spend a lot more just for principle.

Update: I get the standard reach us at this number. I have already reached out to you a number of times, hence this comment to begin with. You want to talk to me, reach out to me. My full name is here, you have my contact. I was a tenant at your property.</Text>< pictures>

Annamarie from the leasing office was very helpful with finding the right apartment at the right price. She gave me a tour of the apartments and informed me that she would follow up with me if any opened up in the price range i was looking for. She did and was very prompt in helping me compete the paper. It was nice to have someone from leasing be patient and attentive as this was a important decision that required many thing to be appropriate.</text>

Annamarie and Nickolina were both fantastic and went above and beyond what they needed to do to make my move as smooth as possible. I would highly recommend using them if you ever plan on moving to Santana Row. They answered any and all of my questions and continued to check on me during my transition to the community. Great experience!

Now that I'm all moved in and settle, I couldn't be any happier living in Santana Row.  My move-in experience was nothing short of class.  The leasing office staff provided excellent customer service and went out of their way to ensure that I was taken care of.  Shout out to Annamarie!  She provided such a wonderful experience while giving me a tour.  I told her exactly what I wanted, she articulated my needs and provided exactly that!  My apartment is everything I asked for and then some!  Since moving in, I've been up and running ever since.  There is always something to do in Santana Row and I will say, that the decision to move there has been the best.  Also, show out to the concierge staff in Misora for their stellar customer service!<//text>

I have been living in Santana Heights for a few years and enjoyed this great place and its proximity to fantastic amenities.
In addition, it is a pleasure to deal with the members of the staff who are always helpful and friendly.
Recently I interacted with the assistant community manager, Talia Stephen, whose professionalism is motivational.<//review>

<review>Shelly Otaguro, one of the Leasing Professionals, was kind enough to show me the townhomes at Santana Heights and the flats at Levare and       Misora. What was nice about Shelly is that she didn't rush me, she answered all of my questions, and she has a great sense of humor. Santana Heights, Levare, and Misora are beautiful properties and Shelly is an amazing person in her own right. If you are looking for a unique place to live in San Jose, check out Santana Heights, Levare, and Misora at Santana Row. Ask for Shelly to show you around. The property will not disappoint and you will meet one of the most amazing and nicest people around.<//review>< pics>

< review>
Had multiple problems with the front office staff, including management while living in the Levare community.

Here are several issues we had to deal with in just a 13 month span:
1) My wife and I packed up everything and started our move across the country from Houston, TX after Annamarie told us the lease was ready to be signed when we arrived later that week, only to find out we were suddenly still missing information just a day and a half before we arrived.
2) Annamarie couldn't figure out how the lease worked, so we signed updated leases 3 additional more times after moving in.
3) We had MULTIPLE noise issues from both the neighbors below and above. The neighbor below I reported to the front office. They told me to start calling onsite security to have a running official log of events so that the office could intervene, it took them 6 months and over 12 security calls to ask the tenants to turn down their music.
4) The upstairs neighbor started playing music from 12 AM - 7 AM on a regular basis - 3 separate calls to police and 3 police visits later, we were told we would have to wait for the tenant to move out. We were never provided or offered with any accommodations of any kind. In fact, more often than not the staff acted like it was a burden to them.
5) Upon moving out, we scheduled a move-out inspection. The maintenance staff was almost 2 hours late, and that was after repeat phone calls to the front office staff. Once he arrived, he spent all of 5 minutes informing me that I would be charged for cleaning, fresh paint, and carpet cleaning unless I paid to have all of those things done myself and presented the receipts to the front office. My wife and I were charged for all despite leaving the apartment completely cleaned and scrubbed.
6) The overall general outside noise is not worth living in an outward facing apartment, but if you don't care then throwing several thousand dollars per month at a subpar-run Greystar for what seems to only be a great location might be a great fit for you.

Before I get the generic "please call us so we can fix these problems" from Santana Heights, I talked with you about all of these things and was met with the attitude that these are all my problems and no other tenants seem to have issues (which is also not true).</review>

< Review>
I usually work on my own cars but occasionally need something done such as an ac recharge after replacing some vital components. Fabian (I think his name was) helped me today and he was awesome. The service here has always been straightforward, reliable, and fair to me. I will definitely continue bringing my vehicles here for the jobs I just can't do or won't do myself.</Review>

Tod is a wonderful mechanic. He fixed my girl "Snow" and all at an affordable price. I will definitely be back to get more work done and will recommend all my family and friends to his shop. AAMCO in El Cajon, CA, right next to Jerome's Furniture. Best shop in East County. Thanks Tod and all his employees. Great Work my friend!! 👍😃</text>

<text>Went in to check on the transmission, due to some unusual things going on, found out it was a whole different problem that wasn't the transmission and cleared the issue I was having with it.
not only did they check the transmission, but realized there was a another bigger issue and fixed it, well knowing that was main problem.
The team here know what they are doing, and doing a very impressive job at it.
any questions or issue with your car, call them and they will do their best to make sure you leave the shop with a smile.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>Brought my G35 in because my transmission was acting funny, Fabian went on a patient ride with me and showed genuine interest in listening and helping me out with my situation, I left the car one day and they diagnosed it at no charge, he test drove car a couple more times (could tell because my odometer went up) I came back next day and they were honest and told me nothing was wrong with it, to just bring it back if a check engine light turns on or if the problem persists. You can tell these guys were honest professionals, I will be returning for any future car repairs.< /text>< Pictures>

Where to start: We are full time RV's (two adults, 2 boys and a dog. Our truck (Ram2500 diesel 2007) had some issues pulling. When seeing who our face book RVers recommend we called AAMCO. Todd was understanding and knowledgeable. I even felt he was on our side praying that we didn't need a new transmission. They researched common issues made a recommendation. It was finished expeditiously. We like them also because they cared for all of us and their experience put us all at ease. The owner and his wife were great as well. Thanks so much!</review>

<Text>I live in Julian and I will only get my vehicles serviced at this Aamco. Todd is a stand up guy. The mechanics are experts, fast and efficient. All of the several things I've brought my truck in to be repaired have been repaired and STAY repaired. The pricing is more than fair(very important to a single mom!) I  especially like knowing it's been fixed right the first time. The only place I completely trust that I WILL get what I want. A fair price and honesty.  I highly recommend this business.</Text></record>

Don’t go anywhere else... you will regret it!
Todd and Fabian definitely know their stuff, they will shoot you straight and tell you exactly what’s wrong, exactly what caused it, and exactly how long you can go with or without a repair or temporary fix. They also diagnose any vehicle on a totally free first time consult! You will NEVER get that at a Dealer...Active Duty Military member here, stamping my approval on the most speedy and thoroughly perfected Job Well Done!</review>

I want to take this time to thank the AAMCO El Cajon team. Although, I did not have an appointment--they were accommodating and fit me in their already business schedule. I was given a tutorial on maintenance and upkeep moving forward to avoid similar issues. I highly recommend them to all. To know they also do a full service check on car purchases is also reassuring. I look forward to continuing this business relationship. Oh yeah, the pricing was very affordable and no hidden fees.</Review>

<Text>Hands down the best place you could take your vehicle too for servicing and maintenance. Had to get some internal parts of my transmission replaced and they made the process fast and easy. Todd at the front desk is a great guy and put up with me calling non stop, asking a million questions about my car while it was being worked on. Would definitely recommend this place over any other shop around.< /Text>< Pictures>

My wife went in because her electricity was going in and out and she was worried of being stranded somewhere with our kids. We brought it to AAMCO in El Cajon and they took care of the problem and most importantly eased my wife's concern. They did uncovered another problem with the car, but here is the punchline. The owner Fabian personally called the dealership to inquire about the warranty. It ended up being an issue that was covered through the dealership and was no additional cost. I'm no mechanic and would have probably paid to get it fixed. Trust goes a long way and I will be a lifetime customer of AAMCO in El Cajon!</review>

Their prices were fair and a little bit later when I had a sensor act up, they helped me save money on it by showing me how I could replace it myself if I wanted to take on the challenge which I did and everything worked out great! when my car had a service engine soon light come on they check the code for me real quick and were able to check under the hood and see that it was a hose that was loose and they connected it for me real quick without charging me since it was a simple fix.

I'm truly pleased with AAMCO services regarding the technical transmission problems I had on my Dodge Dakota. They were very professional, friendly, empathetic, and helpful in resolving my transmission problem. Todd and Fabian are genuinely good salesman. I definitely will be recommending this place to friends, family and others for their vehicle transmission problems.</Text>

After me and my friend came here to get my car rotor change EVERYTHING'S MESSED UP. I throw my $1, 500 and it's been 4 months since we came here and now my car still not okay for getting more issues.

Couple weekends ago car started acting funny, and multiple shops told us we needed a new transmission. Called up AAMCO, because I wanted certified work and a warranty on that kind of work, but Todd explained I was getting ahead of myself. Turned out the wiring was bad and throwing off the inner components! They fixed it quick, but the issue still remained. I was bummed, but again, Todd calmed me and said bring it back in. They didn't hesitate to look again and fix what the issues in that moment. It may be a little more money than some mobile mechanic, but you're getting what you pay for! I'm so appreciative of their work and even for the mechanic, James I think was his name, because they were so patient and persistent in resolving my issues and not entirely breaking my bank!< /Text>

I brought my 2006 F-150 in to AAMCO El Cajon because my transmission was slipping.
I was given a diagnosis along with an estimate and time it would take.
They would explain what was going on, as well as an update as to when it would be finished.
When my truck was finished, the cost was LESS than the estimate and it was repaired and back to be a full day before expected.
I want to thank Fabian, Todd and the whole crew at AAMCO El Cajon for taking care of my truck.
I will recommend and refer you to anyone that asks about where to take their vehicle for repairs.<//text>

I have been taking my vehicles to Aamco for a few years now. It's nice to know you have someone you can trust! Todd is always helpful, recommending what should be done, what can wait, and even if it's time to get a new car! They complete the job in the time quoted, and keep within the price frame quoted. I've even enlisted their help in trying to decide what kind of car I want to buy next.  Update: got the new car, and they've maintained it and solved a couple small issues.< /Text>

Took in my vehicle for a transmission service. It was done in a timely manner. No problems with it. However there were some other issues pointed out with the coolant system. The service person did not push for the service to be done. He just gave me the options and I choose the best one. I will continue to take my vehicle back for regular services.<//Text>

<Review>I have used this service station for several years.  All of the work they have done on my 2006 GMC Sierra 2500 has been excellent.  This has included a new rebuilt transmission, new water cooler with added external transmission cooler, and 100K spark plugs replacement.  Service Manager Todd is quite knowledgeable and helpful.  I would definitely recommend this facility for auto repair and service.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Less then an hour  after calling  Aamco in El Cajon to tell them my transmission died in the middle of downtown,  a tow truck arrived to haul my car and I to the shop. Todd the service advisor gave me a lot of great advice and was very straight forward about what to expect. I have my car back now and it is running beautifully. Def recommend!!!< /review>

While vacationing we had a check engine light on our car. So we stopped at this AAMCO.They checked it right away and assured me that the my car will be fixed by three. The repair was quick and the coast very reasonable. Me and my family recommend this AAMCO for sure.</text>

<review>Fabian, Todd and crew are the best. I have had tons of work done by these guys over the years and never an issue. They are professional, prompt and do their best to give you a good deal. I took my truck in there for what I was told was a differential problem. Big bucks. Fabian diagnosed it correctly however as a slightly off size tire on one wheel. Saved me about $1500. I trust these guys and even though I moved out of town postponed work on my car until I could get back to El Cajon and have them work on it. It is a rarity to find honest, trustworthy people in this business. You can trust these guys. They go out of their way to make things right.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><gmap_id>0x80d959cd1b11ba6f:0x398aa08482ad142d<//gmap_id><name>Sela Rodriguez</name>< resp>

I brought my car here for a second opinion concerning a possible transmission problem. Originally I took my car to a local shop in my town of Ramona where I was quoted $3800 for a complete rebuild. My car, a 2010 Scion XB isn't even worth that.
As it turns out Aamco diagnosed the problem as a fouled spark plug, so I had them replace all 4.
Thanks to the Aamco on Johnson in el cajon for their honesty and prompt service.< /review>

<Review>Fabian and the rest of the team at AAMCO are so kind and willing to help. I came in once just because of a check engine light, and Fabian read the code told all about what needed to be done and didn't pressure me at all to get it fixed since it didn't need to be fixed right away. I would definitely recommend AAMCO El Cajon!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

< review>
So happy to have found these guys!

I travel full time and having spent all winter down in the Baja, I needed a bunch of work done on my Ram truck. I searched online and AAMCO at El Cajon came out on top for Google ratings.

Let me share with you, those ratings are well-earned. From the outstanding customer service you will encounter from Fabien on the desk  to the solid and professional technical expertise from Sam, Todd and the other employees, it shows through that these guys care about their business and they care about their customers. I had no other transport so I sat for a large part of the day in the office (even though Fabien offered to take me back home) and I could see how they go as far as they possibly can to look after their clients.

I can't say more than to state that if I lived in the SD areas, these guys would be my go-to auto techs. I've seen and dealt with many over my life and there aren't many out there that work like these guys do.

Thank you to AAMCO El Cajon for your great service.</review>

Had my car checked and coolant system replaced, It took them no time at all. Todd was straight foward and honest, he could have taken me over the gear box, but didn't. Honest mechanics are hard to find, they will have my business from now on.</review>

<Response>{'time': 1533832929911, 'text': "On 1/24/18 We replaced clutch assembly completely & all the worn out components inside the transmission. Mr Frude came back concerned about the performance of the clutch & the transmission, we prove that the clutch kit installed had failed, not for workmanship issues, parts supplier provided a complete new kit & we took care of the clutch problem. We send transmission to a specialist to have him inspect it (we made Mr Frude aware of it), He could not find anything wrong inside. With clutch issue taken care off, we drove the truck, didn't duplicate any of Mr Frude's shifting concerns.  Also, Mr. Frude started complaining about a difference on the vehicle's speedometer reading, blaming us for the error. We never did anything that could affect the speedometer reading. His truck has oversize tires & a none original differential ring and pinion set that change speedometer reading. Recommended to take truck to a speedometer specialist who confirmed that there was nothing we had done wrong. Mr Frude was calling us names and being very rude. He started a claim with the Bureau of Automotive Repair, BAR agent came to the shop & we provided all the documentation necessary to prove that we have done everything properly under the law. No action was taken against our shop. We would have no problem whatsoever on doing any type of repairs under warranty if we can experience the customer's issues, but we couldn't. Also, we performed the clutch warranty repair and the transmission inspection before the BAR case was started.  Every time Mr Frude came with a shifting concern we drove his truck without experiencing any issues. I am hesitant to send Mr Frude to other Aamco shops for them to check his truck. I invite him to bring his truck to our shop, one of our technicians will drive it with him, if he can prove that the problem exist, we will disassemble his transmission,  inspect it again and perform all the necessary repairs at no cost,  no extension of the warranty is implied."}<//Response><Time>1533779415315< /Time><user_name>Shaun Frude</user_name><userid>105310234150709017846<//userid><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>After reading some of these other reviews that are bad, I don't feel so alone and feel more confident to leave this review for other people to be warned about the shop. Beware!! I had my transmission "Reconditioned" here and my clutch replaced this year. Ended up having to call The bureau of auto repair. when I got my truck back the clutch Job that they had done was not done correctly and my clutch was super Duper tight. When I spoke with Todd about it he shrugged it off like everything was good to go and I just needed to break it in. me and him went round and round on the phone to the point where I had lost all patience with his unprofessional rude, short condescending attitude. This happened many times, in fact one time I was in there with my son and he continued to use bad language in front of him. I don't do well with these types. You get back what you dish. Todd and I have had many phone conversations that didn't go well, mostly because he tries to act like their techs are never at fault. Proved that wrong with the clutch issue. actually after bringing it back twice and finally driving with the tech did they admit their was an issue with the clutch. Its very hard to get things resolved with them and Todd doesn't make it any easier. Anyway, the first time I left the shop, within 15 minutes I got locked out of all my manual gears. I could not shift into any gear. Todd told me if anything happens to  call him and I'll have a tow truck pick you up so He had a tow truck tow the truck back to the shop. Long story short I had to return the truck there three or four times. One of those times they said their was something loose inside the transmission and they tightened that up. The truck had improved for about 2 weeks. Called again and they said that there is nothing else they could do with the truck. And that they seen nothing additional wrong  with it. Obviously,So I had to call the bureau of auto repair because their is still an issue. I would not be making things up if I went this far.... all that came out of that is...that if I take it to another shop and spend the money to have someone else look at it that they would, in the end pay for anything that the other shop found. I'm sorry, but that does not sound like someone or a company that stands behind its warranty. There is still an intermittent problem!!!! they would need to have my truck for a week, to 2 weeks, to a month for it to happen again. First it was happening once every three weeks-ish. Lately, Almost on a weekly or by weekly basis I have to pull Over on the side of the road and toy with all my gears to get it to allow me to get back into gear. This week it has been constantly locking me out of my gears, yet now after a few days its normal again. For someone who paid about $2200 for a recondition of the transmission and a new clutch I pretty much got screwed and I'm left with a shotty transmission job that is not reliable.. This is my work truck that I drive around to El Centro and Oceanside all the way to the border of Mexico all over the place and it is completely unreliable for me and one of these days I'm going to get stuck on the middle of nowhere, Hopefully without my family! So I was not satisfied with what the BAR did for me and they have closed the case. I'm still stuck with this transmission in this truck and the company does nothing to help me to figure it out. I can't afford to go spend a bunch of money somewhere else to have someone look at it and tell me that they can't fix it either because it has to be a problem happening at the same time they look at it. I'm sure that AAMCO could come up with a solution to help me through this but they do nothing and do not stand by their warranty with the transmission. I have a problem still they say they cant fix it. Just like they screwed up my clutch they had to redo the whole job to fix it. But they won't redo the job for my transmission To fix it???? doesn't make sense. Maybe they put some shotty parts in there...sometime those cheap unamerican made Ford parts aren't exact to oem.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Came in on a Saturday without an appointment with what I thought was a major problem. I had taken the car to another garage a week earlier and they told me they fixed it. When the same problem reoccurred while I was trying to move across country, I thought I was screwed! The Owner/Technician, Fabian, said he thought he knew how to fix it for MUCH LESS money than I thought it would cost. Within two hours from the start of troubleshooting, I was on my way down the road with a PERFECTLY functioning transmission! I made my 2,000 mile trip with no further problems and Aamco El Cajon called me to check on my trip. THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!!!< /Review>

I have a car that is highly modified and I was looking for the best way to repair/upgrade my transmission and Todd assured me that it could be done. He stayed in contact with me throughout the time my car was there and let me know what the upgrade would cost and what I could expect. I stopped by to retrieve some items from my car and the technician brought me out to the shop and showed my what was taken out and replaced and it was certainly an eye opener. I've gotten to "play" with my car since (it's not only my daily driver but an 1/8 mile street drag car) and I am impressed! I can't thank the guys enough - I will have to invite them to the track to show off my car to them. Thanks AAMCO of El Cajon!<//Review>< Name>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>The 204,000 mile old transmission on Miata decided to start making really annoying rubbing almost grinding noises one day. I can do most any repair that my car needs but transmissions are a dark and scary realm peopled by wizards and other's with arcane knowledge. Like everyone knows, people with specialist knowledge and all right tools have the power to charge as they please.  So it was with trepidation that I hauled my transmission to the shop in El Cajon. I'd already talked with my wallet about the trauma it was about to suffer and it seemed resigned to its fate. Much to my wallet's surprise, the quote I received for a tear down, inspection and replacement of the synchros and other wear bits was very not unreasonable. It sucked to learn that my transmission was knackered beyond reasonable salvation. It was awesome to  hear that, not only was the search on for a reasonably priced replacement. Not only that, I was given some much needed education and pointers on where I could search too.  I wound up finding my own replacement tranny but the customer service I received were top notch. I'd give this shop my business again  any day. Thank you.<//Review>< pictures>

I had a Car Audio Shop off Clairemont Mesa  screw my electrical system up because they said they knew what they were doing and had done it before.  Wrong!  Well two batteries later a friend recommended me to Chris White at Aamco off Johnson Ave.  I gave them a call and talked with Chris who was very honest and upfront with me and reassured me he would talk to me threw the whole process, and he did!  I had to leave the car overnight so he could let the car cool so he could scan it for hot spots to see where the drain was coming from.  He found they had hooked the wiring up improperly to the wrong fuses.  Frustrating to say the least, but Chris fixed it and he then went ahead and wired the lights properly so they would work.  I wish I would have went to him in the first place.  I definitely recommend these guys they are honest and will work with you.<//Review>

You expressed to us that you did not know anything about this vehicle. So we helped you as much as we could answering all your questions and doing a full diagnosis without charging you a penny. Many years of technical training and the use of a very expensive Lab scope allowed us to see that the speed signal  coming out of the transmission speed sensor was erratic. We removed the speed sensor and found out that something inside the transmission has been hitting it causing some scratches in it. Next we used a boroscope to find out what was causing the damage and found out that a part inside the transmission was loose and intermittently it was getting in between the sensor and the signal triggering component. Even though the sensor was scratched it was still working because it was not broken. We were able to push the loose piece out of the way so the sensor would read. Once we did that the transmission worked fine, as a matter of fact it drove fine when you picked it up, didn't it? So replacing the sensor was not the proper repair. you asked us what would be the worst case scenario to fix the problem and we told you that replacing the transmission with a new unit from the dealer would be the worst case and the cost would be close to $ 3,600.00.  We never told you that that was going to be the cost to fix your car. We needed to disassemble the transmission and fix what was broken only. I understand you had the sensor replaced somewhere else and the car has been driving fine for a couple of months now, but we know it is  unlikely to last too long. It is just a matter of time for the loose piece inside the transmission to cause the same damage the old sensor had to the new sensor. I wonder why it was so easy for you to call us thieves since all we did was to help you without charging you anything and when we told you there was not obligation from you to get the repairs done at our shop.\nSincerely.\nFabian"}</resp>

I gave this AAMO in El Cajon on Johnson a 5 star rating due toTodd the service adviser he actually listens to your needs talks to the tech about your vehicle as apposed to just giving him the work order, he is very honest,  not with just me but to all the customers that come through the front door l can see that as I'm waiting in the waiting room and he is talking to the customers about their car needs.  I would bring my cars back and I do,  I've had them work on my cars for approximately 4 years now and will continue to bring them back for repairs and by the way the techs in the back are awesome too.
You won't go wrong.

Todd was amazingly helpful and super friendly. He laid it out for us straight and gave us the best options possible that would save us the most money AND get us the best results as well. He and the Aamco El Cajon team treated our 93 Crown Vic like a classy lady and now shes running great again. Thank you for all your help Todd and thank you the Aamco El Cajon team.</Review>

I never knew AAMCO did more than transmissions but a friend recommended this El Cajon business to me.  I had recently bought a 1-year old VW Jetta that was formerly a Hertz rental car.  I didn't have a specific go-to place since I've never owned a VW and didn't want to go to a dealer for service.  I don't really know the ins and outs of the car yet but it always seems like the dealers find things that pump up their bill and aren't necessary.  I went to AAMCO for an oil change and they also did a full screening (no charge).  Their staff is very knowledgeable and helpful -- they explained various codes along with advice about whether or not I should "watch or worry or fix right away".  They didn't try to talk me into more work or leave me feeling like something was going to go wrong once I drove away.  I appreciate their honesty.  The service was fast even though they were really busy and I didn't have an appointment. It's obvious the management promotes a high level of customer service so I'll definitely be back.<//Text>

I have know Fabian ever since I started taking my vehicles to AAMCO in El Cajon several years ago.  He and his coworker Todd have always been very honest and accurate in the diagnostics of my vehicles.  The vehicle is always fixed at a fair price.  I have since recommended several of my friends to AAMCO of El Cajon.  They are also very happy with Fabian and is great crew of technicians.  I would recommend everyone to go to Fabian's AAMCO of El Cajon.  Ray Cochell<//review>

{'time': 1490645451459, 'text': "Dear Mrs. Teel,\nI understand that you were having a hard time figuring out why Google was asking you to write reviews from all the places you have been lately and that you did not know how to get rid of all the pop ups on your phone screen. Believe me, I've been there and I've done that. If you can figure a way out to edit your review we will greatly appreciate it.\nMrs. Teel have been a valuable customer for many many years. Mrs Teal said that she hit the one star by mistake and she cannot change it now. We still service her vehicles, after Mr Teel passed away we have continue to help her out. Also family members bring their vehicles for service to our shop.\nGoogle will not remove this review because it complies with their policies.\nSincerely\n\nFabian"}< /Resp>

< Review>
Look I already know what you’re thinking when you read this review on a 5 star eye care. It’s a one out of 100 experience? Even if it is that I’ve never taken time to write a review in my life but the optical department at this location is very unprofessional. Honestly enough to break the great experience I had. I’ve been trying to call and they don’t answer. I called 7 times. No they weren’t on break, that’s between 12-1. I will never come back to this milaskus I’m just going to try the one in palm desert.< /Review>

Dr. Luu and his staff are such friendly and personable people. I got Lasik there and they were very informative and friendly through the entire process. My dog chewed up my medication and I was able to get it filled during their emergency hours because I was taking antiobiotics. I was fortunate to get a reply and filled that same day! Great service and I highly recommend Dr. Luu!</Review>

< Review>
Patrick S. Kelley M.D., is very knowledgeable and comforting, my lasik procedure went very smooth and painless! I love how he was reassuring me that everything goes perfect and gave me little direction of what to do and what to expect during procedure. Very positive and outgoing, its only second day after procedure and I'm amazed how clear my vision is! Obviously I have some dryness in my eyes but its common. My second best decision in my life, thanks doctor, you've changed my life!< /Review>

<review>Dr. Kelley performed my eye exam. I was very pleased how he explained the diagnosis and treatment and will have him perform my cataract surgery. I have complete confidence in Dr. Kelley and his abilities. He also treated my husband for a bacterial eye infection and did a great job. The entire staff was wonderful.

<review>I was very impressed with Dr Kelly. He was intelligent and very well versed in his field. Knew a lot about glaucoma which I have.
I liked him very much and felt I could trust him to help my problem. He also was very kind to an elderly woman which I appreciated very much.
I would highly recommend Dr Kelly 5 Star.

Dr Klaipeda was most reassuring about my eye health. She reviewed tests and did her own actual evaluation. She reiterated previous suggestion about daily eye lubrication and provided a sample of the suggested drops to keep my eyes healthy in the desert environment.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>From the moment we expressed  interest the staff educated me with regard to the expected results to the actual surgery. It took all of 20 minutes with no discomfort. Cathi Soumas in the Palm Springs office was spot on and obviously well trained. Marlina in the La Quinta office took me through all the testing and was so informative I had not 1 question. This company is an A #1 establiahment . I am 53 and see like im in my 20s. LASIK from Milauskas is as close to perfect as I have ever experienced from any service oriented establishment. Hats off to these guys... Thank you Jim</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1583767492191, 'text': "As a practice, we always aim to provide the best care possible to patients.

<text>Dr. Frassato is the best! She's very caring, polite and takes the time to properly diagnose her patients. I trust her with my vision to the fullest and I owe her a ton for diagnosing me and assisting me with getting the help I needed to start correcting my Keratoconus!< /text>< date>

The staff here at Milauskas Eye Institute is always courteous and friendly!
We have needed urgent eye care many times and all of the offices have been able to work us in same day.
I would highly recommend Milauskas to everyone.
All of the doctors are wonderful.</text>

< Review>
Dr. Emberland exudes a quiet confidence and I feel fortunate to have been referred to him by a friend several years ago.  I have seen an ophthalmologist
yearly for 72 years and Dr. Emberland and the Milauskas Eye Institute represent the best of the best.</Review>

I am ecstatic with the results of the lasik procedure...It was touch and go for a few months before  deciding to move forward.  In 1 day after surgery  my vision is 20/20..no more glasses...my reading distance even improved. The staff was thorough answered my questions and surgery was a breeze...if your on the fence and you asked me i'd say don't wait.. thanks milauskas....<//Review>

<text>Never got past the front desk to get seen by a doctor so have no idea if they are as good as some.of their reviews. I initially went to the office near.my house in Rancho Mirage. I gave them my insurance card and set up a date for today. The office called Wednesday and.said the doctor would be at La Quinta or I could schedule another month out. I decided to make the drive to La Quinta. On arrival I walked up and was asked to sign in. I did so and the receptionist said to go sit down she had another patient. So I did. Mind you I'm disabled and getting out of the lower chairs are a real pain. Two minutes later she called me to the desk. After giving her my insurance cards I could tell she was way focused on getting me checked in with little tolerance for anything out of the ordinary. I have two insurances and was trying to explain which was primary. The end of the story is they do not take my secondary and are out of system for my primary and "could just additional cost" for the visit. Why have two insurances and why wasn't.this worked out before I showed up for the appointment? Incompetence at its best. No way would I recommend this place.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80daf91bcb78bbc3:0xc6e02d86ac4bcfda< /gmapID></record>

Mediocre care at best.  I have been without my contacts because the doctor wrote the wrong expiration on a new prescription.  Their computer system has been down now for two days, and they cannot rewrite the prescription.  Unbelievable, PLUS, the office is now CHARGING for PRESCRIPTIONS!!!   I told the optometrist I did NOT want a script for glasses, yet he went ahead and wrote the unwanted prescription and I was charge for the glasses I clearly told the man I did not want.  Horrible!< /review>

Try calling earlier couldn't get through. Needed to make an appointment for a follow-up regarding previous problems with eyes already addressed by this office. Couldn't even leave a voicemail period was very upset. Then later in the afternoon I received a call from the doctor's office asking if I want to make an appointment. Not sure how they got my information or how they need to call me back because I was not able to leave a voicemail. But I'm very happy they did get you out to contact me and schedule an appointment so I can correct my vision problem. They did identify there was a problem with their phones. So it's nice to know that they're trying to fix the problem and reaching out to their customers.</Review>

I miss going to school here! Cabrillo is a great school, it has a great location, wonderful professors and supportive staff/faculty. I made so many friends and connections here as well as discovered my major here. I am now graduating with great grades at CSUS and plan on getting an MA in Child Development, Special Needs Education next Spring 2019. There was a time I took a break from school, I came to Cabrillo and made the best decision for my career.<//Text>

<text>This place has the worst admissions, administration, and employee base that my wife or I have ever dealt with.  I have 2 boys registering simultaneously and both are told different things, both are treated completely differently, and both are admitted with completely different status even though their situations are exactly the same.  The moral of the story is - if you don't like the answer you get from one person, stand in a different line because the person right next to them will treat you completely differently.  It's a total mess.</text>< rate>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Cabrillo is a great community college with many AA/AS degrees as well as certificate programs.  The Culinary Arts programs is awesome with a the Pino Alto Restaurant as a place for the students to cook with their professional teachers and be rated by the public.  The catering class even gives the students experiences catering weddings by being a part of the front and back of the house.

The Cabrillo Summer Youth Programs are great for kids. My daughter enjoyed the computer class in which they put together computers/ or fixed and then added software to make the computer or laptop usable.

The Cabrillo Youth Chorus om the college campus and taught by the college choir director is excellent. The chorus gets invites to Carnegie Hall and other places because of their excellent reputation and quality singing by the young people.  It is a great program to learn about music reading, solfege,  rounds and sing a variety of music - classics, musicals, foreign language songs, etc.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I taught English and Journalism at Cabrillo for over 35 years, retiring in 1995, and it was, and possibly still is, a place where serious or not so serious students might find the excitement and stimulation of higher education.  It is an important asset to the community and widely recognized throughout the state.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>the school itself is great but good luck trying to get any help at all from the Administration office, they don't like to take any kind of initiative and you have to jump through a thousand hoops just to register properly for classes. Other than that i've has a great experience here.< /review>< pics>

Cabrillo is a great establishment. Beautiful campus with exceptional views, many great professors who care deeply for their subject. Parking can be a problem, but usually is remedied when people begin to drop out after the first month or two.</review>

Cabrillo college is one of the premier community colleges in the state, if not the country. The facilities are mostly new and renovated, and beautiful to say the least. If you have classrooms in the upper part of campus you have a beautiful panoramic view of the ocean, but this is not what the review should be based on.

In my experience at cabrillo college, the teachers are wonderful. Many of them are off duty ucsc or San Jose State professors getting work on the side.
This college has many top notch programs including fire tech and nursing. Mr schwinge the fire tech professor was my favorite of all. Great program!<//review>

<Review>The science department at Cabrillo is staffed with moth most gifted and caring doctors and masters of their field. Wading through the waitlists is well worth it and unproblematic beyond the rudimentary introductory courses.
I'm in my second and last year of courses, and the amount I've learned about the wonders of the natural world is staggering.  I've tested the effect of volatile gasses in the environment, extracted and sublimated caffeine from tea, and synthesized aspirin.  My teachers are my mentors and my friends.< /Review><date>1389825016897</date>< Pics>

Chris and Natalie were great. Chris assisted my Son and I with purchasing him his first rifle. Chris was able to point us in the right direction and best for for his size. He was knowledgeable and very helpful. Natalie stepped into help with paperwork. She was very kind and helpful as well. I highly recommend this place. I do not write many reviews but these guys/gals deserve all 5 Stars.Not too many places like this anymore.</Text>

Very friendly helpful staff. Very competitive prices. They have parking behind. Let limited patrons in at a time to shop due to covid for safety. They also have archery gear and the sign out front advertised bait. Will definitely be returning good experience.<//review>

This is the only place that has ammo consistently. I haven’t been one time and they told me they didn’t have any 9mm or 556. They are always stocked up with what I need and very helpful, thank you.< /text>

<Text>Since 1990, I have bought multiple guns from them and also received a transfer of a G3 battle rife replica. Always a smooth, professional experience - and they are still in business, 30 years later, which is quite a feat!  Recommend them.<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< resp>

<Text>Armando and Chris were awesome to deal with. Great source of info and super helpful! I haven't worked with the ladies in the store yet but I could see that they were also really helpful. I could see them all taking the necessary time with their clients to make sure they were getting the right product to suit their needs. Thanks team, wish there were more of you!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Went in today little before they opened. My plan was to take my fire arms certification test and purchase a pistol. The employee Armando was very helpful with everything, and  demonstrated everything perfect. I was nervous going to take the test but come here and if you get the chance to work with Armando, he will help you a lot. I give his customer service a 5 star, thank you.</Text>< GmapID>

Excellent store, very nice staff. Very helpful even with all the stress of COVID on top of the usual mountain of paperwork. Come prepared, expect a little wait, and carry a good attitude. It'll go far.<//text>

Expect to pay 2x msrp and hear the excuse of "covid" or "you cant find it anywhere". You can find ammo and guns else where. Also expect to wait an hour just to get in and then 30minutes just to check out even when you are being directly helped. Their process takes forever for no reason.< /text>

After going thru all the legal paperwork to buy a S&W 38 for $550 the salesman brought out a obviously used box and started to put the demo pistol with scratches in the box.  I said I'm don't want a demo unless you will  give a discount.  He them, with rude no comment attitude walked out the back door to, I think the storeroom.   When he came back he tore up most of the paperwork I had filled out without saying anything to me.  He then started to fill out the receipt and wanted payment.  He told me to come back next week, but still will have the California 10 day wait.  Things got a little hot when I told him I wasn't going to pay for it until he had received the new pistol.  I said give me a call when you have it.  He said I have to pay for it now, not in the nicest way.  By now I was getting upset with him and I guess the store.  So I told him I was not buying that gun or anything else from them.  As a note, I had purchased guns and ammunition from that store in the past, but never again.<//Text>

<Text>Ok, so why 5 stars???
Sportsman supplies is a mom-and-pop business located on Camden Avenue. They have been in business as long as I can remember with the same owner. Over the years I have done a lot of Business with them. BUT it’s been at least 10 years since the last time I’ve been in and I’m positive “John” the owner did not remember me.
“Now the story”
Well it all started last night when I was practicing drawing from the “IWB” position for this weekend’s class. “where we will be running about 500 rounds down range” as I drew, dropped the mag then cycled the slide, the slide went forward but did not return to its full rest position. I noticed right away that the guid rod was sticking “slightly” out of the slide. My reaction was “what the...” how is that even possible? So I immediately tore it down and found the back stop of the guide rail had snapped off. So I searched the inter web and found that there was no way of absolutely getting one in time for my class.
I called John the owner of Sportsman supplies and explained my dire situation. He was very understanding and said to come in with the broken guide rod and he would see what he could do. When I got there I showed him the part and “you guessed it” he didn’t have one in stock.
NOW HERE IS WHERE HE GETS THE 5 STARS.
John was so kind that he pulled one out of a used guns that he had for sale and lent it to me for the weekend “no questions asked”  needless to say I ordered 2 aftermarket all steel guide rods from him.
Sportsman supply I can’t thank you enough!!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>Always a positive experience whenever I go there! Have bought several pistols, rifles, shotguns to include a Matthews Compound Bow there! The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the firearms and archery equipment.

Their prices are very reasonable and in most cases they're cheaper than the nearby competitor. What's nice is that you get exactly what you come in for. No BS no bait and switch and all the parts are there when you buy it and when you pick it up.  Believe it or not but I've been to other stores where parts were missing from a brand new gun I just got.

These guys are a bit further away from where I live but I will make the trek to their store cause I know I won't get screwed.

They've got my business for life! My friends and family all go there as well!

Everyone....be safe out there and shoot straight!<//text><username>Ash Custodio<//username>< Time>

I have been a customer of this store for over 20 years and have always had a very positive experience there. It's a very compact store but well organized and the staff has always been helpful and knowledgeable. There's also a gunsmith attached to the building and I been happy with their services as well. Their prices have always been decent and the best in this area. I would recommend this business to anyone.</text>

I have been purchasing guns, ammunition and accessories from the people at Sportsmen's Supply since I became interested in firearms about 10 years ago.  I have always found them very pleasant, knowledgeable, and fair.  Occasionally a younger member of the sales staff may give a vague or incorrect answer to a question, and if I doubted the person, they referred me to one of the more experienced older staffers who set me straight.  I have always felt respected as a customer and citizen, and I would encourage anyone to visit this store.  I might get better pricing on the web, but with so few good local gun stores I try and throw as much business to them so they can stay in business!< /text>

<Text>Came in for a bullet button, called ahead and they said they had them in stock. Once there picked up a mag well lock and a 10rd mag, both items were priced at $19.99. The gentleman gave me the bullet button in a ziplock bag which means he took it off a gun and proceeds to charge me $65 and change for the 3 items. What a rip off, $20 for a bullet button!? Ridiculous , my first and only experience there, I wanted to support local shops but not when they want to take advantage of the customer. Beware and ask for pricing upfront before you buy, he'll better yet shop around or better yet somewhere else.</Text>< pictures>

Been to Sportsmen's Supply a few times and they are just great.  They really know their stuff and take the time to help you.  I was looking for load information for an unusual Nosler bullet and the information couldn't be found in any of the loading manuals.  The fellow at the store was able to find it online and recommend the correct powder. It's a small store so the selection isn't the greatest, but the service is excellent and if they don't have it they can order it.

I have been in this store three times.  All three times it has been evident that most of these guys have no idea what they are talking about.  I am law enforcement, and have been hunting and shooting since I was old enough to walk.  To give one example, I went in looking for bonded hollow point pistol ammunition.  I asked to see one box and then handed it back to the guy behind the counter and told him I was looking for a bonded hollow point.  He looked at me like I was stupid and told me that all hollow point ammunition is bonded or it would break up on impact.  Well, he was about 50% correct technically speaking, but was rude and unprofessional.  Hallow point ammunition for pistols is best if it is a bonded bullet, to prevent core-jacket separation “breaking up”, but there are plenty of pistol hollow point ammunition on the market that are not bonded, such as the Remington Golden Saber Non-Bonded I handed back to him.  Two out of the three times I have been here I walk out empty handed based on bad manners, poor salesmanship, lack of real knowledge, and way too cluttered sales floor.  I do not recommend, and will not be going back again.< /Text>

I had a really good experience with Sportsman Supply on the purchase of my first pistol.  They happen to be carrying a rare, hard to find pistol and sold for a competitive price versus my research on the Internet.  Knowledgable people and accomodating.  I love the feel of a small store that's well stocked.  Makes you feel VIP.</Review>

I have been going to Sportsmen's Supply for many years and they provide very honest and reliable service.  I have purchased guns, ammo and scopes and they always gave me the right product for what I needed.

I would highly recommend them for your hunting and fishing needs.<//text>

<Text>This is a very small but awesome store. Very neat, clean and organized. Staff is very friendly and seemed knowledgeable. Prices are a bit lower than other stores in the area but they can get a whole lotta customers with better pricing. Their FFL fee is bit lower than other stores. I will definitely return to this store.<//Text>< user>

I bought a pistol from this shop.  Came in twice and I had a very unpleasant experience on both occasions.  Very poor customer service, unfriendly staff and poor selling skills.  I asked "hey, your price on Glocks are slightly higher than the other shop, any chance you can match the price? and the guy responded "if they are cheaper, buy from them".  Another response was "are you buying the gun here?". It's like saying if you're not buying I'm attending another customer.  Unfortunately,  I had to buy the pistol from them because it was late in the afternoon and the traffic was heavy to go back to the shop that sells the pistol cheaper.  When the guy was doing the mandatory demo, I noticed the gun was not fresh and suspected it came from the display which the guy acknowledged and told me "we sell guns from the display all the time".  Well, it maybe fine even though the gun maybe dry fired and the slide was released too many times without snap caps or dummy rounds that may damage the breech and firing pin. Besides, I'm a customer, I want to be happy with my purchase.  During the waiting period,  I called to make sure the paper work was going well, the guy said if you don't hear from us, it's good.  Well, how long does it take to check the application with DOJ and confirm the status - approved, delayed, rejected?? On another day I came to pickup, I asked about swapping the barrel out in the future the person had no clue at all and asked me to approach another staff  which was attending another customer and told me to wait. I left and went back to work.  Their prices on guns and accessories are the highest than the 3 neighboring gun shops.  If you're new or undecided which gun is right for you,  this is not the place to go.  There are way better gun shops within 20 mile radius.  Don't waste your time and gas money.</text>

< Review>
Some poor reviews on here, and everyone has a different experience, but I've had nothing but good service here.  Staff is friendly, will take time to go over anything you're interested in, provided that they are not totally covered up, which seems to happen a lot lately.  I buy most my stuff there, even 22 ammo.  I might be able to get it for a few bucks cheaper on the internet, but I can't go look at and handle a rifle 'just to see how it feels' over the internet.  Of course that's how I ended up with most of the rifles I've got.

FYI, I'm a vet who took up target shooting twenty years after I got out.  I'm no expert, but I'm not a novice either.</Review>

two days ago was our first time we went to this restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last. We enjoyed the evening very much with the courteous service, with the magnificent  food and fine drinks and with the friendly pay. We will absolutely visit there again.<//Text>

<text>Loved their chicken pizza and their pepperoni pizza. Because the slices are huge, the some pizza get super greasy.

They have a really nice salad  bar. You get a bowl and fill to your hearts content.

It's a little pricy, but single slices are huge that is like a fourth of a medium pizza.

They have a deal to get a slice, small salad, and a drink for $9 for a line special.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><gmap_id>0x808fc9428eebd3a9:0xa567113c731a581d</gmap_id>< date>

<review>This once used to be a very  reasonable place with good Pizzas but not sure what happened. The food became expensive and quality went down. The creamy garlic chicken pizza was not creamy anymore. The wings were dry.< /review>< username>

A slice is still a Quarter of a Whole Pie. It's $5. Many years have passed since it was $3.50. I'd still buy it, even knowing what it used to be. My only complaint is that the topping density may have declined over the years, and having a more-expensive, less-generous slice doesn't really make me want to recommend this place as much as I used to.<//text>

We order Premier Pizza for work meetings and it is just a walk away from my job as well. Love the salad bar! Pizza and salad deal for lunch is an awesome deal -- I would take advantage!<//review>

Pretty average place. The thing I like the best about this place is it's proximity to my place. They've happy hours on the beer.< /text>

< Review>
The pizza here is satisfactory, but the quality seems to be closer to a Little Ceasar's than that of a Papa John's or dominoes. They also close at 8:00PM which seems really strange because often my friends and I don't want pizza until 10:00PM or later for a late-night pizza binge.</Review>

Poor customer service. I would not recommend this place to anyone there driver cut me off on Montague express way while i was in a fuel tanker on my way to get lunch. I go inside with my colleague to order its the same person with an attitude and very unprofessional. I request his managers information and he refused to provide it and said they dont want people calling them so i asked for his name and he refused to tell us. FYI- To anyone part of the premiere pizza organization the tall, bald Caucasian male should be fired.</Review>

I like premier Pizza, but this restaurant has the worst customer service. First they took too long to make the pizza, second they made it wrong, and third they were not willing to get me the pizza I wanted.

Person in charge told me I have to eat what they are giving me. I have never been in a restaurant where they want you to eat something you don’t want it. I could have food allergies. NEVER going there again.<//text>

I got my alarm system here around November and the front desk were really friendly and they offered me also a surround system. Pricey but it was worth it. I forgot the names that helped me out ever since then I haven’t had issues with me alarm nor my surround system so these guys are the best. They did an amazing job.</Text>

After a week of installing my audio system, I am ABSOLUTELY SATISFIED with the qualify of the installation, If you are intending to make upgrades to your audio, make sure you do your homework, know what you are talking about, so when Harbor Sounds advise you something, you will know that they are the real deal.
I will comeback for my Full Sound Deadening project for my Lexus NX soon, looking forward to it.
Many thanks !!!!</text>

They will for sure rip you off for rims, My boyfriend bought rims here and they charged $500 a rim, just to find out we could have got them at a different shop same rims for $150 a rim. Save yourself getting ripped off and go somewhere else or do your research on the rims because they are over charging for sure. Better off going to JW Motorsports in Bellflower it’s worth the drive they have great prices, and don’t have rip off prices.</text>

The tires I purchased from Harbor Sound feel extremely smooth, runs really well and haven't had any issues. The service I received by Abe was fantastic, he was very friendly and professional. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone< /Review>

I returned to Harbor Sound in January 2021 for installing a new Pioneer 8600 NEX and a rear backing camera for my second car 2009 Honda Odyssey. Again the manager Oscar with his honesty, friendly gave me a great price and services. Beside of that Oscar helped to install the “USB AND HDMI” at the car lighter for my brother’s car 2014 Toyota Prius without additional charge even his Pioneer 4600NEX was installed in November 2020. So I must write again to say “Appreciated” to Oscar and to his great staff and services. 🙏😊🍷🎉🎊< /Review>

I had an alarm and tint installed and the customer service was excellent . The time frame for the installation was spot on and pricing of products and labor was very reasonable.If you are looking for a place where what's promised and it is delivered - Harbor Sound is the place to go.Good job guys.</Text>

I went in looking for a wiring harness for my vehicle and fortunately they had it in stock which was awesome since i couldn't find it any where else. but then i thought i might as well buy the radio here too so i asked to see their selection available for my car. He showed me a few and the first one he showed me he quoted me 80 for the radio and 115 installed but unfortunate for him i had done some research on radios prior to making this visit and that same radio is sold at autozone for 29.95. So i just got the harness and said no thanks to the radio and their services since i can do it myself. oh and the harness that was supposedly for my car had the pin connectors all out of order had to reorganize it myself which caused me more of a hassle. this place seems to only be there to trick you into overpaying for items.<//Text>

I went around a few shops locally in Santa Ana and compared prices for rims and tires for my 2017 Toyota 4Runner. Harbor Sound gave me the best pricing for some fuel rims and falken tires. Installation was fast and everything came out well. Will definitely come back here with my Infiniti when I save up.< /Text>

The jury is still out. I was dealing with Jimmy on a speaker purchase and I feel as if he dropped the ball. However, his son has picked it up and continued. We'll see how it goes. 1 star for now...<//review>

Worse place to go get your Window tinting, customers service so poor and prices are way to high. I went there to get my Windows tinted and they didn't do what I asked for it. I took my car back even with receipt and 90 days guaranty. Oscar the manager was so rude didn't wanna listen and check my car to show him what I was talking about. I paid $150.00. Definitely don't recommend this place.<//text>

<text>Really the worst places to buy or install any type of rims or stereo  . They will try their best to take your money   definitely had the worst experience the owner and staff are just straight rude and disrespectful  . They lie about every single product they have and try to up sell you stuff that you don’t need . I would suggest everyone take their business away from this shop . One min  they will give you a price within the next min that price went a $100 . Really shows how their business is falling apart .< /text>< pictures>

Dont ever come here if you're looking for value... it's a total bait and switch shop they quoted me 120 for tint and I get there and they say its 180. All of my friends have been here and they recommended me. They all got their tint at 120. Bad business. Rude people</Text>

This place is the place to go for rims, and sound. They have a great team to help you out with financing and will get you rolling in style. I highly recommend Harbor Sound. I am very pleased with the service 😁</review>

I brought my car in to get tinted and they told me it would take approximately two hours and I came back after almost fours hours since they didn’t call me, and they said it would take another hour. They said the person tinting had a personal affair to take care of before starting on my car. They could have a least called so that I could find another place to handle such troublesome work. They are unprofessional always smoking and don’t seem to care enough about their clients.</review>

I am only putting one star because I have to but seriously people do not ever ever go to this place again these people are not series they will give you a price and something and then when you get there it's the double expensive especially you're getting credit They said that I was gonna be paying $100 a month and I trusted this people and now I've been payin  $153 for 12 months And I still owe them 2000 just for 4 rims And 4 Tires Plus I found out that the rims are not really original so they are a scam plus they finance me with 2 companies saying that it was better but now I have to pay double amount so seriously never come here this is a really scam The guys will talk good to you just to sell you stuff but just don't trust him  read the reviews 1st and then find out but please never never never go here I'm trying to Sue them because of this problem this guy finance the rims in the tire with 2 companies and he said that I was gonna be paying a $100 a month and now has been over a year and I still old in like 2000 just for a pair of   Rims... Plus I had a  to go  To their shop a few times because they didn't even did a good job Plus they were really rude when I went there and told them to fix my thing because they didn't do it good at 1st so please don't go there try to look for a better in serious place these guys are a scam and a joke.

Porfavor amigos nunca vengan a este lugar son una estafa te venden pirateria por cosa bueno, y luego me icieron fraude cobrando el doble, cuando les digan que van a usar dos companias para el finanseo no acepten les dicen que para que no cobren mucho interes y al final cobran el doble,,< /text>

This place is run by moron's... Called to ask for a pricing and on a wire harness. The guy in charge just told the dude on phone to tell me to "just come in, we'll give you the price here" HAHAHA.... Great way to "Run" a business into the ground. If that was the service over the phone with a potential customer, now I can't even imagine what kind of crappy work they do on cars.

They try to scam you on prices and they're mean as hell. Never step into here they want you to finance and get a bunch of extra stuff you don't need. They treat you like you're stupid and don't know what's going on. All in all horrible experience. Mike is the rudest person to deal with.</Text>

I have not had any issues with the rims and tires. This is not the case with my audio system. 1st time I had to come in was due to one of the amps overheating. They blamed it on the weather. I gave it time and had to go back for the same issue and had the amp replaced. 3rd time my subwoofer stopped working so I brought it in. This time around I was not given a reason for the failure and was sent on my way. 4th time my back door speakers stopped working completely so here I go to the shop again. They claimed it was a loose cable. I left and two weeks later both my front door speakers stop working. I'm currently sitting here looking at every worker just pass by me and not one has looked into my issue. I have tried getting a refund and was told I had to pay a restocking fee on defective merchandise. I would also like to mention they have ruined my brand new car by scratching the plastic that goes around the windows. I have added images to their G+ page for reference. Stay away from this place.

<Text>I do not recommend this place. They all say different prices. I was quoted 120 for my car tint with lifetime warranty. All of my friends got this deal and told me to come here. When I get there they say there's a 4 hour wait. They think I'm stupid enough to leave a 60 dollar deposit and leave my Keyes and come back in 4 hours. Then he says its 180 with warranty. I laughed in their face and left that place. Bunch of scammers never go here.</Text>< Pics>

Horrible service. Broke my car and said it wasn't them. My doors don't unlock or lock. The alarm they installed goes off all the time for no reason. They tried to pressure me into buy GPS, TV's in my backseats over $3,000 and the manager wouldn't stop pressuring me. I will never be going to this place again.</text>

1. Damaged car
2.took 2days to do a couple hour job
3. Chipped fender paint and blamed it on me,
4. Tried to misleads me with smooth talk
5. Rattle under my car I need to fix idk where it's coming from,
Scratched my rims and brake calipers
TRULY A TERRIBLE BUSINESS,

ITS LIKE HAVING YOUR GHETTO FRIEND WHO YOU DONT REALLY LIKE BECAUSE HES RUDE AND STUPID WORK ON UR CAR BECAUSE HE SAID HE KNEW HIS STUFF, THEN FIND OUT HES ACTUALLY RETARDED

I WOULD SUE BUT I FAILED TO TAKE PICTURES BEFORE AND AFTER, I WISH I RECORDED THE WHOLE THING,

I INCURAGE SOMEONE TO RECORED UR INTERACTION AND SUE WHEN THEY MESS UP.

This place is all bad just save urself, really couldn't say anything good about it, bad vibes all around which weren't fully clear until they really just started making mistake after mistake

1. Wheel offset they chose (as experts HA) was not right for the car,
2. Took 2 guys a full 8 hours to do a few hour job, then had to come back the next day

3. Lowered my car and damaged front fenders very bad, paint chipped massively, gunna be expensive to fix, and they tried to tell me it was my fault because I wanted the car lowered, ( I thought u guys new what u we're doing? I've lowered 2 cars of my own never has that happens)

4. I seriously had to work on my own car, they wouldn't adjust the camber kit, WHICH THEY INSTALLED WRONG LMFAO are you joking,

LONG STORY SHORT DO NOT HAVE THE GUYS TOUCH YOUR CAR

I HAVE A RATTLE UNDER MY CAR I NEED TO LOCATE, I FOUND SEVERAL PARTS NOT SCREWED DOWN PROPERLY<//Text><Rating>1< /Rating><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I thought this place was great. But i was majorly wrong! I just got a sound system installed from them a month ago and one of my amplifiers was defective and it kust stopped working about three days ago. A day after it stopped working, i took it to the shop (harbor sound) and all yhey could say is "come back tomorrow". So i went again today and they told me to, you guessed it, come back tomorrow. This is complete bullshit i shouldn't be experiencing this especially for the amount the system was worth.only a month!? I regret reccomending people to these guys just so they can go through the same bullshit im going through. Definately not coming back when i trade in my car next month.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Excellent service and about the guarantee I bought a subwoffer 7 months ago and it stopped working, I took my car and they checked it, they changed it for a new one, excellent only that one of the workers was like annoying that is not good for the store and also another smoking there people who cannot stand the smell of cigarettes, in short, excellent service, just for that reason, give 4 stars

The customer service at Grassdoor is second to none. They have online chat support for any questions or issues and they respond immediately. That alone sets them apart from any other service I have used in the past and also makes ordering really simple and fast. In addition to the great service they also give a 15% loyalty discount AND they cover 25% of the taxes on your order. Grassdoor is the ONLY service I use now!<//Review>

Wasted my time trying to set up 2 separate medical orders over an hour before closing. Very unprofessional and wouldn't give me the time of day to deliver my meds. Won't be able to use my limited time deal offer now that my orders were canceled by the drivers. Was hoping to do lotss of business but

I'm beyond disappointed and can't be paid to do business with GrassDoor again</Text>

<time>1590863021291< /time><rate>5<//rate><Review>I recently switched my delivery service to GrassDoor and while they aren't the cheapest, they're certainly one of the most professional that I've experienced. I've listed a few things that impressed me:

Easy to use website which makes ordering a smooth process. They also have live chat if you have any questions about flowers

They show a tracker where the driver is at in real-time so you know where your order is and ETA

My last order took over an hour so they put a $10 credit into my account that can be used for future orders<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1613184787448, 'text': 'Thanks for taking the time to review and for choosing Grassdoor!'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cf28dbc6d073:0x66774d38408acfed</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Top notch delivery service. I have been using them for months and I have never had an issue. They are quick to respond, very friendly and have the best deals and prices around the LA area. They sell only the best products. You can’t go wrong ordering from this shop. They also have amazing referral and discount programs on top of it all!!! Best delivery service around.< /Text>

I love that they offer occasional discounts but wish I could get regular deals as part of a subscription service. In any case, a great place to order from!</review>< Pics>

They are fast, they are great with customer service. I love the speed. I have used them for nearly 6 months, I feel like the deals are in the half oz indoor bags of flower. But I would say try them out. I love that they take my CC. Get those miles! Haha< /text>

Really cool delivery service, I must say! All the products they carry are interesting and unique. They are very potent for the most part and the delivery speed is incredibly fast. The service area is also really vast which helps out so you can use them pretty much wherever you are in LA!< /Text>

Could not recommend this delivery service any higher. You can schedule a time for items to be delivered or have it delivered within 40 minutes. Huge many with a variety of products and good prices too! Referral program and loyalty discounts are awesome! Look no further for your marijuana delivery needs :)<//review>

<Text>I love these guys. They have great selections and they deliver SO QUICKLY. It’s such a blessing to know I don’t have to wait 2+ hrs for a delivery of something I would never buy in a storefront. I love that Grassdoor carries the brands I enjoy.

I could honestly say one of the best delivery services on the market. The drivers that I have encountered are extremely responsible very fast and also professional. This is the only service I use for marijuana delivery they respect everyone of their customers and are genuinely a good service.< /Text>

I spend hundreds and maybe even reached the thousand on pods and pax . I loved the company never asked for anything but the quality service they always provide . My problem was and when they finally lost me was when there chat online customer service curved me so hard after having a problem with the REFERRAL PROGRAM I send the link to my friend the purchase was done I showed her the proof .. I did exactly the same as I had done it one time prior .. and I was robbed from my credit I explained with pics and she still fail to acknowledge I was the one who referred the client after going at about half a hour she desired to just do the ultimate disrespectful thing she could possibly do !! Close the chat!!!! I honestly hope you guys change ! But for me you lost me as a client and I will never refer anyone and I hope you guys clean up your act for your future customers ...treat your clients how you would like to be treated  !<//Text>

I’ve been purchasing legal cannabis in Los Angeles for years now and up until now I have never experienced a good delivery service. Grassdoor changed the whole game to the point that all my friends make most of our purchases through  provide quality weed and concentrates at great prices. Best of all they offer many deals and referral programs so don’t miss out!</Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>They "accept debit cards" but the zip code on the card has to be same as your delivery address. They also don't list this until checkout so you can waste as much time as possible choosing items for your order only to realize a random restriction on their end will prevent you from actually checking out. Waste of time. There are plenty of other delivery options that don't have this restriction, or they at least list this restriction earlier in the checkout process. I wish I hadn't wasted any of time with Grassdoor, there's so many delivery services in LA to get your medicine, don't waste time with companies like Grassdoor that have inconvenient policies anyways. Dissapointmet guaranteed. Probably won't have to wait long until this company is gone like the other dispensaries in LA that can't get their act together.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1613184711131, 'text': 'We are sorry your Grassdoor experience earned 1 star.

<text>They are super short staffed so their ETAs are consistently useless. You don't get an eta until the driver is actively heading to you, which can be hours after you order despite their "45 minutes or less" goal. If they had the staff it would be good but it's not worth the markup and delivery fee at this point<//text>< Rating>

<text>I have been using Grassdoor for over a year and it was amazing...until the last two times. My bag wasnt sealed either time and the seals were broken both times on the flower inside. It happens once, okay...but twice? I called customer service the first time and they were so unhelpful that I didn't even bother the second time. The bags always used to be sealed and so were the jars inside...too bad it has gone downhill. I will feel better just going to pick up my own than wonder if someone has had their grimy fingers in there swapping out my flower for something else, or pinching it like it's 1996.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1583861559070, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear that your last two orders arrived in an exit bag that was not sealed. The exit bags are childproof but not adult proof. Drivers can open them and reseal them. If a driver wanted to open the bag and “pinch” the flower, they could do that and then reseal the exit bag. It would not make sense to “pinch” the flower and then not reseal the exit bag and make the customer suspicious. An unsealed exit bag is not an indication that the products were tampered with. Regarding the flower jars not being sealed, that is a different story. Our policy is to always make free, no questions asked exchanges anytime a product is not properly sealed upon arrival.\n\nWe are happy and willing to swap any unsealed products. Sometimes the seals come off as they are just stickers that can come loose over time or during transportation. We have an awesome customer support team that should always support these requests. It is unfortunate that you did not contact customer support the second time this happened as we would have made it right and given you a credit to offset the inconvenience.\n\nPlease email\xa0support@grassdoor.com\xa0and we will go above and beyond to earn your business back. Thank you and we apologize for your previous inconveniences.'}< /Response>

They lost us as customers,  would never recommend this delivery service to anyone< /Review>< Name>

The best cannabis delivery service I have used! They are quick to respond to orders and the wait is minimal. Their products are top notch quality as well, I have yet to receive a bad batch from Grassdoor. If you want quality products without having to leave and go to a dispensary, give Grassdoor a try!<//text>

So I actually don't like a lot of delivery services because I feel like they are all overpriced and have wait times of over an hour (with my luck usually 2). However, grassdoor is not only really fast, they give you text updates for every step of your products journey. Most importantly the weed is amazing!<//Text>

<review>Always super convenient- and we've turned all of our friends onto Grassdoor so we've ended up getting awesome discounts almost every time. I love that the menu is a bit smaller because I get really overwhelmed at some of the other sites. I can order from Grassdoor and it takes less than 5 minutes to get exactly what I want at a totally fair price with delivery within the hour :) What more could you ask?< /review>< gmapID>

My experience with this service blows their competition (won’t name names) out of the water. All my deliveries, inquiries, or issues with my order are promptly resolved in less than an hour — what else could I ask for? To top it off, they have great selection of authentic products from hard to find brands. Really adds to their shop and keeps me coming back

Thanks TK for help with my order!< /Text>

If the 50% ftp deal (amongst many more) didn’t sell you, the costumer service and high quality product will! TK has helped me numerous times when I make a mistake with my order and always makes sure that I’m 100% satisfied by the time I get my package. Short wait time and a great menu. Oh yea and did I mention they give you $10 for each person you refer. Highly Recommend 👌🏻< /review>

<Review>SERVICE IS A SCAM. DO NOT USE. I have had to file a police report and a report to the Better Business Bureau concerning their fraudulent behavior. They are currently under investigation by the US Labor department for misleading the American consumer. They are astonishingly slow and not particularly intelligent.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>The only delivery service I use since others just either take to long, charge too much, or mess up the order and you don't get what you ordered.

Grassdoor is in my opinion the best a delivery service can get. My favorite thing about Grassdoor is that you will findthey consistently try to keep good quality products stocked. Grassdoor does not carry stuff that you will find disappointing.</Review>

Grassdoor is magical 😎
I was hesitant to use a weed delivery platform, then I met Grassdoor. Their website is easy to navigate, always reflects what’s in stock, great selection , and has an awesome kind courier/delivery crew and support team . They have the perfect curated selection of products. They offer extremely generous promo credits and even are helping pay part of the tax on orders for as long as they can. They have my favorite kiva gummies and an awesome selection of live garden dabs and flower. I can’t recommend them enough. Their delivery averages out to about 20 minutes every time I order. One time I placed an order and barely had time to run to the atm 3/4 of a mile away because the delivery was so fast.</Review>

I've been using grassdoor for a couple of months now and I am super satisfied with their service! it's really easy to order from their menu and the loyalty discount always comes thru!! as a parent with a busy schedule, I prefer to get my meds fast and I avoid having to wait in line at a dispensary....☆☆☆☆☆<//review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Grassdoor is my goto now for raw garden carts. The delivery speed is always fast and they provide a live GPS on the driver so you dont need to rely on ETA texts. Also the live chat is always active and respond quick af. FURTHERMORE. Since they offer raw garden at the best price of any delivery in CA(pays for 25% of your total tax too) and uses the best delivery system (GPS), nothing comes close to Grassdoor. Thank you for always being reliable GD!<//Review>< pictures>

Amateur Alert! It seems like a fake company that posts "jobs" everywhere to phish for personal information of applicants. I can't find "grassdoor" offering any product or service in the real world except trying to be a middleman.<//Review>

I love grassdoor because they never cease to provide good, amazing quality, really top of the line cannabis products for a top of the line experience. This is far best, and hands down the best cannabis delivery service in LA. I wish the others could take after grassdoor but right now grassdoor is always my first place I look whe. It comes to ordering cannabis and having it brought to you! Delivery is always right around 25-45 mins!</Text>< pictures>

<user_name>Michael Mandel<//user_name><review>Website is very buggy and hard to use.  Not worth the time.  Tech support is slow to respond, and clearly very ill informed.  I wasted several hours today trying to enter a credit card that their site said was not valid, but is somehow valid everywhere else.  Tech support couldn't care less, and there is no option to speak to a manager.  get your medication from a real company.  I tried to use their site because of a 50 percent first time discount plus a 10 dollar credit, which was only a lure to waste my Sunday.</review>< UserId.>

If you're a movie buff wading through the $1.95 "buy ten get five free" section, you'll come across piles and piles of garbage. But be patient. Be persistent. Amongst all the muck, there's hundreds of little diamonds waiting to be uncovered, and sometimes the thrill of those discoveries are truly exhilarating. Pictured are 45 movies I found and got for less than 60 bucks one time. This doesn't even include some of the best stuff I've found on other days I've gone. I don't know of any other place in Fresno that deals in physical media with more value to the dollar than Rasputin's.

In addition to movies, I've also purchased quite a few records here. The value to the dollar you get for music is not as exciting as it is for the movies, but the selection is still excellent, and you'd have to scour thrift shops in Clovis to find a better selection of records than you'll find here.</Text>

OMG!  It is Thursday, May 21, 2020 and the City of Fresno has just announced doing away with the City's shelter-in-place orders as of 12:02a.m. Tuesday, May 26 and all stores will be able to be open and back in business.  I am so psyched.  Am an avid customer of Rasputin Music in Fresno and am chomping at the bit to come in and start spending money again at your store.  I am hoping that you will be open again starting Wednesday, May 27, 2020.  We all need you back.</Text>

Great store, I collect music CDs and I always find good pickups here. I just wish they content was better categorized. Megadeth, Metallica, Pantera are all in Rock and not Metal which is the case for most classic metal bands and thats just crazy. Journey and Megadeth are not the same category no matter how you slice it. Still it's my favorite place to shop locally for music.<//text>

Unbelievable that they've managed to stay open with how incredibly rude and snotty the staff is. I don't normally leave bad reviews, but my experience today takes the cake. They kept accusing me of being some random person I guess they didn't want there. They had absolutely NO proof. The smug staff guy said "I never forget a face!" I could tell that he was lying. He was so condescending and wouldn't tell me anything about what was going on, so for all I know he made it up. I'm really not sure if it was a real thing or if the guy was just on a power trip. I wouldn't recommend giving them your business if this is how they treat customers. There are better shops in Fresno with staff that actually acts professional. They actually threatened me and I don't wanna give my money to people that treat me like that, although I am a patient person so i did try to reason with them. By far they have the worst customer service I've ever seen and it's not worth the few dollars you might save.</text>

You never know what great films you’ll find for 50 cents to a dollar!! Other than that their films are well organized by categories and their staff are very willing to check to see if they have certain titles in stock. But...if you find a hard to find film you’ve been searching for get it! Otherwise it may not be there the next time. This happened to me twice. Love Rasputin Music.< /Text>< pictures>

AMAZING DEALS! Just went in the other day and they have DVDs for under a dollar! They have it all! Books, video games, t- shirts, music CDs,records, VHS, DVDs...you name it! Employees are definitely helpful. Set aside some time because it is VERY easy to get lost in the experience! This place is a true gem!!< /Text>

<Review>I love this store. I have found the employees to be very helpful.  Check your purchase right away as the return policy is a short time, but returns are not a problem. Lots of variety, good prices and you can order anything you don't find. Have been going for several years and have had 1 movie return.< /Review>< pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I love this place I could spend time and money at Rasputins because everything is inexpensive and the inventory is tremendously huge. I'm talking DVDs, video games. Music CDs, tee shirts, posters. VHS videos. It's worth the time and money.

The best place for cheap movies (and music)... The more you're willing to dig the steeper the discount< /Review>

Rasputin's is awesome. There is an amazing collection of movies and music here. Everything is very well organized into categories and well maintained. Plus the staff is not only knowledgeable, but super friendly. If you are looking for physical media check here first.</review>

After driving past this place for years I decided to stop by. Lots of tapes/vinyls/CDs for almost any genre. It's a lot cheaper than buying your music online</Text>

Not really a store for vinyl heads anymore. What they have is extremely over priced and every time I come here the selection gets smaller and smaller and smaller. Really don’t know where this store is going anymore, if its a movie store or a used CD store or book store?  They got a little of everything I guess but it used to be great for vinyl.</Review>

<date>1559859940283< /date><review>So this is the place where you can walk in with two dollars and walk out with entertainment. Whether you are into music or movies, TV shows, video games or just people watching there's always something. They have the coolest rock band t-shirts of all times. Give yourself time to roam around if you don't have any specific titles in mind. But if you do call ahead and ask them to hold it for you because things move quickly in here. Overall I like this store very much and recommend it for the whole family.< /review><rating>5<//rating><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

One of the last or couple last good record stores in this area. In the days where digital music is bigger than ever real record stores are hard to find. Rasputin has a fair selection of music, DVD's, clothing ,turntables and a couple books.</text>

I'm always surprised with what I am able to find here. This place feel like a time capsule where you sink in and easily get carried away with everything. The prices range depending on how much you're willing to spend. You can find a brand new movie/CD for it's original price or settle for a used one for what seems dirt cheap to me.<//review>

I always love the experience I have and the nostalgic smell of a video store of the 80's. Yeah that's right corner video!!! Lol.... It's awesome & the prices are awesome but they are kind of cheap when it comes to buying your stuff! Call before you go</Text>

The music selection was horrible. The worker and customers in there looked creepy. It smells. There was no extra employees to help anyone TRY to find anything even remotely good. It's sad that there are no good music stores in Fresno.....<//review>

I've been here three or four times. It's a nice large store from California's glory days that undercuts Amazon on used blue rays. Ridiculously vast selection of clearance used CDs and vinyl (like a buck each). The store focuses more on entertainment media than fye and I'm rooting for it to keep popping against the remaining brick and mortar sources of recorded music and movies for sale.

Beats the Best Buy and Barnes and Noble by miles</Review>

Great selection of movies, CDs, and games, plus some other stuff. Honestly I just go for movies, great prices on most stuff in the store. The staff is always helpful, all you gotta do is ask for help when you see them, and they're right there</text>

Honestly? The young Lady helping me out at the register. Was amazing, went out of her way to find a dvd for my special needs daughter. After I purchased over $150.00 in cds & DVDs. She used her own money to buy my child a Rasputins staffs tshirt. My child will barely take it off. Thank you! 🖤✌🦇</review>

A great date spot for hipsters like my hubby and I :) they have great deals on used movies and CDs. We had such fun finding obscure items for super cheap and they have popular items as well for great deals. We ended up buying seven movies for under $10 and just loved the whole experience. My husband said it reminded him of vintage used record stores.</text>

First time in a Rasputins and I was floored by the variety. From movies to cds to their decent collection of vinyl. Found various things I wasn't really looking for. Got a DVD movie ive wanted for my collection amd also scored some really great deals on a few classic albums. Will definitely be going back many times< /Review>

I was able to find a bunch of compact discs that I liked in the massive inventory available at this location!!! Compact discs are awesome because I am not always in range of radio transmission when I am in my vehicle. Make sure you look in the sliding drawers underneath the massive tables of compact discs to find what you might be looking for.</Review>

What's not to love than this treasure trove of CDs, vinyls, boomboxes and dirty DVDs for an extra touch of class? This establishment has seen my business since the Black Keys released "El Camino".

Merchandise is organized by alphabetical order for maximum convenience. Go easy on the staff or I'll break your knees, this place is ALWAYS neat and organized for YOUR convenience.< /Text>

This place has the best selection of music movies in the Fresno California area. It's nice to browse the selections CDs and DVDs and even vinyl albums. The vinyl album selection it's not too bad and they normally have latest releases for sale. They don't have much of a selection of used vinyl but there's other places for that. The compact disc music selection is incredible they probably have what you are looking for unless it's been out of production for a very long time. The selection of used and new movies in DVD and summer Blu-ray is really good too you can probably drop 40 bucks easily but take home a wide selection of movies</text>

<Text>As a vinyl enthusiast in Fresno, visiting Rasputin is essential. I prefer to avoid the impersonal experience of buying vinyl online, so this is generally my first stop. But I am always getting closed on when I come here due to their early closing times. I would spend more here if they were open later.< /Text><UserId.>108774705082468311401<//UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1533575787088< /time><name>Kelsey Blumen<//name>< GmapID>

i love browsing at Rasputin, and recently I was looking for a specific cd that I was having trouble locating in the store and the worker karina helped me find it within literal seconds, I’m so grateful! Thank you!</text>

Went to Rasputin's in SF when I was kid on a church retreat. Bought a few Marilyn Manson CDs for like $10. Have loved them ever since they started here and replaced Tower Records. If they don't have it, they can get it! :)<//text>

< Review>
Why am i customer having to go get change of 100$ for you. If $100 breaks your bank are yoy really a business. Not only was i gonna get turned a awa but was told someone else was turned away. And when i came back for what i wanted to buy. Another guy was being told sorry we cant break 100$  someone in line helped him out. The staff only push the blame on the company. And when i ask for the manger to pass along my complaint, he turn the subject to the show i was buying. Theyve. Got money to buy movies to up the price on but not to make change. Stop with the sorrys and pushing the blame make your store better. 200 in single 100 in 5s and 10s and dont for get cjange to quarters dimes nickels and pennys.
Amazon! Looking real good right not</Review>

They usually have good deals, but I went in specifically for a dvd copy of The Little Mermaid...which was priced at $19.99! Might as well purchase on Amazon Prime Video. However , several copies of The Goonies priced around $7 👍< /Review>

Great selection of CDs and DVDs. Lots of band tees. Decent selection of expensive new Vinyl and some great used titles sometimes hiding in 50 cent - 1.95 bins. The staff morale and service could use some work. There always seems to be panhandlers out front, which isn't the stores fault but they're clearly not doing anything to prevent it. Not open late enough for a music store.</Text>

The staff is friendly. The vinyl selection is lacking a lot of newer indie. Bring in more than one or two copies of new releases please!< /text>

My husband and I enjoy shopping here, even though you can get everything on your phone or ipad, etc... its cool to still be able to look thru movies or cds to find the right one.  Plus they have an awesome selection to choose from, sometimes better than amazon on price.</text>

Not only that, but they have newer releases that other stores might be slacking on. They have some pretty special vinyls for anyone looking to collect. They have a good CD collection as well, but its pretty clear that rock is what Rasputin majors in. If you want rock, then just go here. They have something for everyone. Don't know if they have an anime section, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did. A lot of DVDs a person can buy too. Basically a collector of physical media. Don't really know about their service because I work better when people let me focus on what vinyls and CDs I want to buy, but its probably alright.< /Text><Time>1483141127792<//Time>< resp>

<review>If I would have known that Rasputin had my childhood music here I would have been here years before a few days ago, I spent $560 in 3 trips rebuilding my childhood 90s rap collection and there prices are awesome as some of this stuff sells online for 5x to 10x their prices. Each day I went it was a different person providing me customer service but they did go above and beyond to help me find what I was looking for but the reason for the four stars instead of the five is; #1 : they do not offer a customer appreciation program such as buy 10 CDs get one or free buy 20 CDs get one free etc, and #2 : the CDs I was looking for that I was unable to find in the store they did not have a way for me to obtain them which would have been perfect because then I'd be done, such as ordering third party where you can pay upfront, they order, then they call you when it's in the store for you to pick up, that would of been perfect or another way would be is if they could take down our information such as name and phone number and the CD were looking for and as soon as it comes in they give us a call in an opportunity to buy it that would of also been a Perfect solution. I'm still missing about 10 CDs I need to complete my childhood collection. Either way Rasputin is a wonderful place to purchase CDs as their prices are on a variable so some of the CDs you're looking for you might be able to find used at a cheaper price here<//review>< Pictures>

They have so much to do and see here! Everything is very well organized and they have records, movies, video tapes, CDs, and even some video games. They do have a lot of stuff to look at and you can even listen to some of the stuff. The staff is very friendly and they always open up right on time and they always feels right on time so make sure you're there in between the closing and opening.<//text>

Love this store! I'm a classic TV fan & I can always find what I'm looking for at a great price, and in great condition! I can't always find what I want at Target or Walmart & when I do its too expensive. Rasputin is awesome!! I love it that I can actually afford to buy the shows I love!<//text>

<Review>Usually happy here but recently went to trade in some DBZ movies & Chris the manager made my Husband & I feel like theives by saying he couldnt take them because someone had the exact ones to sell them but were stolen merchandise. But we had our Amazon history to prove it. We decided to leave without the trade. We went to F.Y.E. Better customer service and merchandise by far.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Rasputins Music is probably the best music and dvd store i have ever been to, i think i have been going there for about 5-7 years tops and yeah i think out of all the other stores its the best for me. The staff there is very cool and laid back and very helpful if your looking for something certain and they have the best selection ever. This store is 10/10<//Text>

I had ordered a LP and I called to check on the status of my order. They ordered it twice while I was waiting for it to come in. Then they wanted me to let them order it again, WTF would I want to do that. Anyway seems like the staff is not really interested in customer service and enthusiasm. 😎</Text>

<Text>Unfortunately this is the biggest record store in Fresno. They have good deals, and a pretty good selection....although, can't always find what I am looking for.

Staff isn't very knowledgeable about music.

They don't carry many officially licensed band shirts, seems weird that a music store would mainly carry knock-offs.<//Text>< Pics>

Good place to go if you're looking for an old movie or one that isn't well-known. Honestly target or walmart would be a better option for new releases. It's a little musky in there and there's no real "help" from sales associates. Kind of disorganized but you can definitely find some gems here if you feel like hunting.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
As you walk into the establishment, you may (probably not, though) be greeted with an almost inaudible, "...hello." by one of the less-than-helpful staff. Upon searching through their selections of CDs, you may notice that they are merely MOSTLY alphabetized with random "D"s in the "C" categories, etc. Although the aforementioned lack of knowledge concerning the alphabet is indeed frustrating, it is the least of your worries. The next issue of concern is the actual price of their merchandise. Unless you are buying used items (even then, it may still break your wallet), be prepared to be high-balled out of your hard-earned cash. Granted, you may occasionally find something for under $7, but chances are the item - assuming its a disc - will be scratched to hell (hence, the reduced pricing). Moving on: if you plan on selling any VHS tapes, cassette tapes, CDs, DVDs, or Video Games, be prepared to be mocked with a smug scoff or out-loud chuckle. Also, make sure you weren't planning on buying anything with the money you assumed you would get, because they pay you literal pennies (I had planned on selling some video games around Christmas and - to my dismay - I was offered 5 cents for the majority of my items). In summary, sell your things on Amazon or eBay. Next issue of concern: don't bother applying for a job there. Not only does the establishment not take applications (literally...they don't have Rasputin Records job applications), but I've also been tipped off by a reliable ex-employee who informed me that they hire within a limited circle of friends, the "Rasputin family" network as it were. Nepotism at its finest. Lastly, the employees: the majority of the staff are rude and virtually unknowing about the availability of music in stock. Don't bother asking to see if something is in stock. You are better off looking yourself. Rasputin assumes a virtual monopoly of music in Fresno, and they are aware. Don't support Corporate America. Buy whatever you are searching for online.<//Review>

<review>Worst place to go to if you are actually passionate about movies, music or anything they sell such as furnishings and what not. The employees are not very knowledgable about movies or music and the store opens at 11am on top of all that. This place is terrible but when it comes to used vhs they can't be beat. I HATE THIS PLACE but until a mom n pop shop opens with all my favorite movies used then i have nowhere else to go.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>If you want expert customer service go to Best Buy and pay for it. If you actually want used crap a place like this is perfect, sure the employees won't win any nobel prizes for their personal care or outstanding conversational skills, but the place is named "Rasputin's Music" not "Ronald McWunderfuls Magical Palace".

I personally love a laid back place to get stuff and browse.

10/10, two thumbs up and all that.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

It's ok, you might find a thing or two. Staff have no knowledge of music. Artist and genres are all over the place super unorganized.  You will take long to find anything you are looking for.</text>

<Text>Best selection and a massive variety of DVDs (movies & tv seasons), VHSs, CDs, records, band t-shirts, and posters (along with cassette tapes). Prices are ridiculously great and they pretty much have anything you need...some of their DVDs date back to the 30s. And the atmosphere is solid; the staff really know their stuff and are super helpful. Basically, whenever people ask where they can buy these items, I always recommend Rasputin!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Great selection, good prices on used cds and dvds. They have new and used records. i must ad that due to having so many genres separated into sections it can be difficult at times to find cds of some bands, but sometimes it can make it easier. Find your favorite band tshirt. love this place...love places like this.</Review>

This is a great place to find old CD's, DVD's and blu-ray's. I wish they had a greater selection of blu-ray's but I am assuming this will grow in time. If you are old school and still like listening to CD's, you will find a very large collection as well as DVD's. You can definitely spend a long time browsing their selection and do some major damage to your wallet. I will look here first before purchasing a new CD or blu-ray.<//Text>

THESE GUYS ARE RUDE AND HAVE NO MANAGER SKILLS WHATSOEVER. THEY DO NOT GREET YOU OR ACKNOWLEDGE ANYTHING YOU SAY. THEY MAKE YOU LOOK STUPIED TALKING BY YOURSELF AND NO CONVERSATION EITHER. SAD PLACE TO GO. I'D RATHER GO TO FYE IN CLOVIS, ITS BETTER THAN RASPUTIN AND MORE FAIR WITH DVD PRICES. TAKE MY WORD.
