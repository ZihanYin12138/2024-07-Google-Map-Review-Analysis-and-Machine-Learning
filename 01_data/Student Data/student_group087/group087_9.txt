<review>Guys and Gals..Born and raised in Hyderabad. My opinion as foodie.. Save yourself time, money and disappoint. The quality is really bad, rice, oil used, too much masala and spice. Don’t even compare this cloud kitchen to another other regular places like Biryani Pot, Biryani Bowl or Vijayawada Biryani.
Honest review so they improve and nothing against any individual or enterprise. If you don’t believe you can try :) and realize. Wonder how others rated them high ? must be fake reviews whos knows 🤔
Again, the mentality I believe comes down to physical presence and physical interaction and feedback vs cloud kitchen.

First of all the 5 star is for the quality of food. It may not be seen right away when you look at the food but when you eat it you will know it.
I am sensitive to any taste enhancers or non fresh food. I rarely eat outside for the same reason.
I tried food from this restaurant for all the hype my friends has given. The food definitely lived upto the talk.

Food tried: goat fry piece biryani and chilli chicken<//Review>

<text>I loved the mutton fry biryani. It is actually the first place where I liked the way mutton was cooked. Definitely a place to try. Prices are also quite reasonable. The way they packed the food was amazing. I’d definitely visit this place soon again.</text>< GmapID>

Incredible place that deserves more ratings and stars. Drove all the way from LA for a visit in the area and happen to stumble upon this place.
It is one of the best biryanis I have tasted in the US. Ordered a family pack and the quantity and taste was awesome. Very juicy and very spicy. A must try for biryani fans. Very good service also!!!< /Text>

<text>Thought of trying a new restaurant to order lunch today, finally end up ordering this restaurant. I ordered Goat curry, veg biryani, Paneer Makhani, Dal and Mango lassi over phone. The quantity  of food is more than other restaurants and quality is good. The taste made me to write this review, this restaurant made me to remember my foodie days in Hyderabad, street food. Me and my friends enjoyed the food. I strongly recommend to try out this new restaurant in city.<//text>< pictures>

I ordered goat curry and it was salty with more bones and less meat. Quantity was less for $18 goat curry in short not value for money.

I always order biryani from biryani house which is really good but other than that i don’t think anything good in this restaurant.< /review>

This is a cloud kitchen. Overall experience of picking the order is seamless. Coming to the food, it is not upto par. I have had biryani from here twice and both times i am disappointed in the taste. The quantity of food is really good. However, the amount of masala in the biryani is limited which makes the biryani taste not so great.< /Review>

The food I have tried  here are excellent. My personal preference is the goat biriyani but ckn boneless biriyani is also excellent. The ckn is tender and rice is flavor full. For appetizers I prefer the ckn pokada and rayala seema mutton fry. I heard some of their is also good but I have yet to try them.<//review>

In the non-veg biriyani pack we get to select the type of biriyani and a free appetizer. We selected the chicken fry biriyani and gobi manchurian as appetizer. The gobi manchurian was a small serving, but the taste was really good. Not overpowering and saucy!

The chicken biriyani combo had a big serving size with two full eggs and serves four. It was very spicy and those who cannot eat spice, better to leave a note while ordering. It comes with a raita and gravy curry, the latter is a bit watery.

There was a surprise dessert with the order -mango sabudana kheer. It was yummy and really helped with the spice.</Review>< date>

These battered fried panko hot dogs is an experience in texture. It is crunchy,  gooey,  chewy. It is also sweet, salty, fatty and spicy if you like. They're also beautiful.<//Text>

I honestly did not really understand the popularity behind this simple corn dog until I tried it. The half mozzarella and half sausage is amazing. I’ve never craved a corn dog before until I’ve had this.</Text>

<text>So much rave about these Korea originated hot dog place, I had to pay a visit and try them myself.  At first when I arrived there, I couldn't find the place as it was a tiny confined space in the corner of the plaza food court.  Luckily, the place wasn't busy, just few people waiting for their order and no one on the line, surprising! as I was anticipating a long line especially around dinner time.  The price I thought was reasonable, original starting at $ 1.99 for original hot dog all the way to $ 3.99 I believe for squid hot dog.   Didn't take long to get my order and I had a choice to either dip it for sugar coating and I preferred not to.  They also had different types of sauces to top it which plays very important role in the taste of these hot dogs.  Otherwise, these hot dogs are unique that the batter was made with 'sticky rice' where it's more chewy compared to dry bread batter.  And other unique thing is that some has cheese inside.
All-in-all , it's definitely worth the try but nothing to die for.< /text><user_id>108109693006874101582<//user_id><Rating>4</Rating><date>1569019164823< /date>< gmapID>

Corn dog with sugar? You kidding! But wait! It’s so amazing! Like AMAZING! Myungrang has so many choices that you can pick from. After deep fried the corn dog it will be covered with sugar( this is an option, you don’t have to add it if you don’t want it ) and there are also tons of sauces you can add on yourself at the sauce bar, such as ketchup, sweet chill, mustard and more. DIY it yourself.
Not to mention their rice cake bowl. LOVE IT! The best one I’ve had so far in Rowland area. It’s flavorful and the rice cake cooked perfectly with the fish cake too. Will definitely come back any time soon! Love this place</Text>

<Name>Anne Sanchez<//Name><Date>1568346713956< /Date><Rating>3< /Rating><review>Located in a plaza that has plenty of free parking , tried out this new place .  The line went pretty fast to place the order , but since a whole lot of people was there getting our food took a while .  I’m glad I had the sugar put separate, I didn’t enjoy the sugar or any of the sauces . But that is just my preference, so if your not too sure about sugar on your items ask for them to put it on the side .</review>< Pics>

I ordered a squid ink batter with cheese sausage coated with sugar, the melted cheese resembled a mozzarella sticks while the fried batter resembled a churro. I did appreciate the melted cheese churro combination, I did not care for the  sausage from the package. The sausage was just an ordinary hot dog. I was hoping the sausage would resemble a Chinese sausage or a German one.  Now that I tried one, I have no intention of coming back in the near future on the account of high calories. In my opinion, I think it was alright.< /Review>

<Review>A very nice place and clean. I ordered a hot dog with cheese a sausage and, the cheese was delicious! You could even have it with or without sugar, plus other topings of your choice aside. I recomend this place if you are in a hurry or, just need a quick munchy to satisfy the cravings. Everything is cheap and, the young girl who takes the order is very nice and friendly.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c32b5af9ed2159:0x3bff2973644096d9< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) It's the same as it was in Korea~ It's really delicious even if you eat plenty of sauces that aren't posted in Korea, and it's really delicious even when it's cold 👍 The hot dog and mozzarella added with potatoes are highly recommended😊

한국에서 먹던맛 그대로네요~ 한국에서 투고 안되는 각종 소스도 넉넉히 주시고 식은거 데워먹어도 진짜 맛있어요👍 가격은 한국의 두배가 넘지만 그래도 사먹고싶은 맛이에요!! 포테이토 추가한 핫도그와 모짜렐라 들어있는거 강추요😊< /Text>

The girl should find a job somewhere else to work , driving off customers.  We will not be back.  Pastries dry and tasted old too.< /Review>< pictures>

I did piercing with Mike. He absolutely did not take into account the features of my body that were known to him and made the piercing in such a way that limited the ability to wear a ring of a smaller and more convenient diameter. And this is very strange given the vast experience of his work.</Text>

Nice and clean , great safety precautions,  thank for that.  Awesome quality jewelry,just a lil on the expensive side. Mike pierced my infant daughter's ears, I'm a returning customer for more than 14 years several piercings and tattoos later, slightly upset at the guy working  the counter insisting that I leave my purse out front saying i wasn't able to take with me.(even after seeing other customers with their purses in the 1st room)He was slightly rude. Could've given me a replacement ball to my barbell free, but was still charged... all is well tho.</text>

I was impressed not only with my piercing experience, but also with the care Mike took in making the environment sanitized and safe. I personally have been cautious about visiting in-house businesses since the pandemic hit, but I felt very comfortable there. Great experience and I'll definitely be back.< /text>

I went for my 16th birthday a couple years ago and they charged me $200 for a nose piercing and jewelry piece that rusted within a few months of having it. Definitely feel like I was robbed. I really don’t recommend.< /review>

The staff isn't especially friendly or helpful in answering questions, including the piercer I had. Example: No info was given regarding aftercare except "use soap and water."

But the healing process has been smooth sailing in comparison to other experiences so that's worth something.</review>

<text>I have spent hundreds of dollars here In Piercings  and jewelry alone, I went today to replace a lip ring I lost and they wouldn’t even sell me one without an appointment.

Took my teenager to get her ear pierced today and had a wonderful experience.  The shop was clean and felt very safe. Michael is amazing. If either of us ever get another piercing we will book with Michael again. Truly a great experience.</Review>

My husband and I took our 4 month old daughter to get her ears pierced. Michael helped us and talked us through the process and was very gentle with our baby. We are glad we found a great place!< /Text>

Took my daughter here to get her ears pierced. Profesional and friendly staff, clean and safe environment as well as quality titanium jewelery. Highly recommended. Samantha Kodani made my 12 year old feel relaxed and comfortable and is also highly recommended.</Text>

<text>Impressed with how clean the place was. Temp check at the door with mask made us feel safe the entire time. Best part was how GREAT Michael was with my little girl. When she got nervous he calmed her down and walked her through the whole thing. Will never go anywhere else, great job!!!! Thank you so much<//text>< pics>

Would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is looking at getting any piercings done.  They were clean, sanitized, and helpful with any questions I had.  If your thinking about going to a different piecer because of price.  Remember that quality jewelry is better in the long run. If you cheap out on jewelry you are opening your self up to issues later on.  I will
Be going back for my next piercings.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>This is my 3rd visit here. Last time was for my teen's nostril. This time is was for her belly button. Everyone I've ever come across here is so nice. And they carry unique beautiful jewelry. I'd totally get stretched just to be able to wear some of the things I've seen here.<//Review>< Pictures>

The shop is very clean and well put together. Mike was absolutely phenomenal with our 4 month old baby girl and very informative. Once she was prepped and swaddled the procedure only took a few short minutes. There was only a brief spurt of tears (as each side is done seperately)until I was able to BF and comfort her; then it was nothing but smiles. She hasn't fussed or cried another tear since. We will definitely be returning for our teens helix piercing. Thanks again Mike!< /review>

Made me feel at ease and I was super impressed with the cleanliness of the place.   It felt so sterile as if being in a doctors office.

Fantastic place to get pierced. Professional, fast and committed to safety and hygiene.  Max was my piercer and was wonderful.  Funny, kept me distracted, and got the job done quickly.  Will definitely be back when I figure out what else I want done.

This was my first time there, I chose the place because of the reviews.....so glad I did.</review>

Walked through the door to a perfectly clean parlor with lovely receptionist, Marissa. Jewelry was beautiful and the piercer, Samantha, was very efficient and skilled, but when my friend started to have second thoughts she began to behave unprofessionally and pressure her to still get the piercing. Samantha bullied my friend by ordering her to get on the table multiple times and saying in an annoyed tone that she “wasted her tools” if she were to back out. Would have given 5 stars if she hadn’t acted so childish and unprofessional.</Review>

I loved my experience at The Exotic Body!! I went in to get my second ear lobe piercing that I had been wanting for the past year. I was a bit nervous in getting the piercing just because ears pierced I got a huge infection and the overall experience was not a good one. I was nervous going to The Exotic Body because I was afraid that something bad would happen and I would get another infection. However, my whole experience was absolutely AMAZING!! When I got there, the front desk lady Bailey, was so nice and made me feel so welcomed. And then when I got called into the back, I was a bit nervous, but the woman that pierced my ears, Sam, was absolutely flawless. She made me feel so comfortable and went through the whole process with me step by step. I have had the piercings for about a week and a half now and I love them so much! I would recommend to anyone The Exotic Body and to ask for Sam because she is so great!! :-) :-)<//text>

<Review>I have used this shop for all of my piercings.   I have never once felt talked down to or patronized.  If you think it's rude for the piercer to ask you not to touch your piercings in the shop, then you just dont realize how sterile they have to keep it.  Michael Samantha and Pablo have always been sweet to me and mine, so I can't picture anyone mistreating anyone.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Took baby girl to get her ears pierced. Very knowledgeable about their products and very professional. These guys are fantastic and very skilled. It was hard watching baby girl getting her ears pierced (My wife and I cried more than my baby girl) and it’s very hard to find someone to trust with your baby but they did a great job, had fantastic sterile technique, and I highly recommend them. Priced very well considering they give surgical-grade titanium with Swarovski diamond product. Especially for your little girl, you always want the best and I’m glad I found this spot.</review>

<Text>They need to tell people when they walk in the door that if they use a debit card or credit card that they will be charged a $5.00 convenience fee. This is such a rip off!! Most people aren’t walking around with cash in their pockets on a regular basis, so most people are forced to pay their ridiculous $5.00 convenience fee. They are just too cheap to pay the merchant fee charged to their business for taking debit and credit cards. If your a business that is the cost of doing business and with the prices you charge especially with the prices you charge for your jewelry it is really sad that you feel that you are entitled to charge your customers even more money in the form of a convenience fee. You should re-exam your business practice in this area.<//Text><name>Alicia Adams<//name><gmapID>0x809ad0be2d4d0865:0x731a355af0eb81dc< /gmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rating>1</rating><user_id>102746407776173828039<//user_id>< Resp>

Just got a piercing today and I couldn’t be happier!! Michael was so nice and made the whole experience calming and relaxing. I went with a friend who also got one and although we waited for a while, it was just fine because we knew we were getting quality care and attention and not just a rushed, sloppy job.< /Review>

Samantha is the best piercer I've ever been to. She is very skilled and comforting and helped me to relax during my navel piercing. Even though I had scar tissue from previous piercing, I didn't feel the needle at all! She is so talented and such a sweetheart; will definitely be coming back again to see her!</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I went to another local, well known tattoo/piercing shop in Roseville this past spring to get some old & closed-up earlobe holes repierced. After a horrible experience with an unskilled and unsanitary piercer, and after allowing my ear several months to heal, I came to Exotic Body on a recommendation for another repiercing. Max was amazing. Super friendly & SUPER clean. I absolutely recommend him. This shop is on the pricier side, but you get what you pay for & it's totally worth it.

Hubby and I took our 17 year old in for a nose ring re-piercing (3rd time) and were going to get our 5 month old her ears pierced because I saw a review on here from 8 months ago saying they pierced their infants ears. Figured we've been here a few times and they were nice. This time the lady behind the counter seemed aggravated we brought our infant in and immediately said "NOPE! That baby cannot be in here! The sign on the door says nobody under 14!!"

I'm curious to know if the rules have changed in the past 8 months but either way...she was so rude, we won't be back.<//text>

This place used to be good when Lisa worked here. She was kind and she was on top of educating us about aftercare. I've come here for [three septum piercings, two with Lisa and one with a shorter white girl who was also so nice that I bought her donuts afterward] and then I came back for a consultation once after I got my philtrum pierced in Humboldt a year ago to ask if it was healing right. I come in and Michael Hare is there and as soon as I open my mouth with questions, he fired back condescending answers. I chalked it up to him being cranky and quirky and never mentioned it to anyone. I came back two days ago with some friends and wow that's his actual personality. Not only was his attitude patronizing and he made some fatphobic remarks to my friend... he pierces her belly button SO CROOKED. I mean... you can't brag about doing this for 12 years and do work like this. Pictures shown below. She paid $120 for this.< /review>

Absolutely LOVE Pablo! He has helped me pick jewelry several times and pierced me recently. Gentle, professional, informative, and made me feel totally comfortable. He quickly picked up on my taste which made me trust his opinion and guidance! The shop carries high end jewelry including Swarovski gems! Keeps it's  display case sparkle unlike other jewelry. Finally body jewelry that doesn't look like it was bought at the mall<//text>

I love this place!! The vibe is great and so relaxing! It is  Immaculately clean!! They are the only place in Sacramento that is part of the PPA which is so important when you are getting pierced. The staff is so friendly and reassuring!!! I just got my verticle hood piercing, and Sam was awesome!! Super knowledgeable, she explained everything to me perfectly!! I could not be happier!! Highly recomend her!</Review>

<date>1569394993824< /date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I've gotten 4 out of my 5 piercings here and when friends ask me about where to get a piercing this is always the place I recommend. There are a few good shops in the area but The Exotic Body still stands out from the rest thanks to level of experience & profesionalism the staff have.

The owner can come across as a bit no-nonsense at times which I think can be off-putting to some people, but from my perspective it's really a good thing. The staff are all positive people with a good sense of humor, they just have a preference for responsible nonsense. Which is what you want from someone who's about to stab a needle through part of your body.

It's clear that the owner, and all the staff, not only love what they do but take it seriously. They understand that the art forms they practice create a permanent change to their clients bodies & come with risks, and because they understand this they make sure that everything's done right.

The place is always clean, they have ideal sterilization practices, they teach you about aftercare, they advocate the use of safe jewlery materials & design, and they help their customers to make informed decisions and  get through the piercing process as easily & painlessly as possible.

It is a little more expensive than other shops in the area, but not by a lot. In my opinion it's worth it for the quality & sense of security you get by going to such a top notch place. I trust the staff here and have always had positive experiences with them.

I've had piercings done here by both Samantha & Mike. Sam did my tongue piercing and my helix piercing & Mike did both of my genital piercings. They both did a fantastic job and (obviously) made a repeat customer out of me. I'll be going back here when it's time for my next piercing, and I recommend that anyone else who's looking to get a piercing choose The Exotic Body as well.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
This is possibly the worst piercing/tattoo shop I have ever been in customer service wise. Every visit I've had the employees have never really been pleasant. But during my last visit their employee with the butterfly tattoo on her cheek had asked if we needed help and I let her know that we were just browsing. She offered to show us more jewelry in the back so we followed her to the back room where she had asked to check my tunnel size. So I had taken my tunnel out to give her so she could check. She rudely advised that they don't want you to touch your ears and touch their doors. If she would have politely told me prior that she would remove my tunnel with gloves on her hands I would not have removed it myself. After she had removed my plug she then told me to wash my hands in a rude tone as well. I apologized and washed my hands. Then after she had pulled a few plug options from the back to show me I had decided I wanted to wait a little longer to buy my next size. She at that point mumbled under her breathe "seriously...?" Confused I said "yes?" because I had told her I was just browsing in the main room. Then she stated that she pulled all these options out for me and was very rude just because I didn't want to buy something right that second. She gave my tunnel back to me in the baggy she was holding it in. She then went straight to helping my girlfriend look for a new septum ring. She had not offered to put my tunnel back in. After sitting for a second, waiting, I finally decided I'm going to put my tunnel in myself so I grabbed a glove from the box on the wall to use since they don't want you to touch your ears. She then rudely said "Oh. You want your plug back?" I didn't know they didn't want customers touching their ears. Again if they would have stated that I would have gladly let her put my tunnel in my ear. But when she did put my tunnel back in my ear she was very rough with my ear and seemed angry as she put it in my ear and surprisingly made my ear hurt. Which isn't something that happens when I take my plugs in and out of my ears when cleaning them.
Then she told me I could wait for my girlfriend out in the front.
My girlfriend had let me know that she was super nice to her throughout helping her. But thinks that she was extremely rude to me and that it was unwarranted.
I will never go back to The Exotic Body, nor will I recommend this shop to anyone ever again.
Try Chief Piercing located downtown. They're just as clean and have a great jewelry selection except the customer service is 100% better than here.</review>

<review>This place is very professional, I used them for an industrial piercing 6 years ago and they were the first people I thought of for my nose piercing. I had done it myself with a safety pin when I was younger but had let it heal, so there was some scar tissue but Mike did a really great job. It was quick and the pain was minimal, and it was exactly how I wanted it. They explained aftercare for me and asked if I had any questions, and the healing is going well. The only thing I dislike about this shop is that every time I've been here they've tried to up-sell me on the jewelry, and they push pretty hard even after you've said "no" once. If you can stand your ground though, this is definitely the shop to use!< /review>< pics>

<Review>This place has awesome jewelry. I kept driving by until one day I finally went in. I'm so glad I did. I like my new nose ring. I don't have to worry about it falling out or being pulled out by accident.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Previous to Exotic Body, I had gone to Claire's for ear piercings and the experience is not forgotten, comparisons I don't really draw because it's apples and oranges.

Anyway, this review is meant for the staff not for customers. If you are looking for some reason to come here, scratch that and just come to check it out and build your own opinion of the place.

I like the people: they are authentic, know where the professional boundary lies and treated me with dignity. I felt that the whole process of getting my spider bite was an autonomous one; I didn't feel like a commission sale, or a child (P.S. you cannot feel inferior without self consent). So what I am saying is, I had a good experience: I followed after care instructions and any time I had questions about getting my jewelry put back in, they did it for free. It was awesome. I felt well-taken care of and all along the way, the staff were a team. I couldn't have asked for a better batch of human beings to help me with my first facial piercing. :)</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Time>1512284376926<//Time><rating>5<//rating><review>Decided to get my tongue pierced here after a recommendation from a friend that got his done at this location. Pablo was super friendly, knew what he was talking about, and got the job done with quality jewelry for a really solid price. I do recommend that you BRING CASH as they have a fee for using a card and their ATM doesn’t allow you to withdraw the appropriate amount of money (my piercing was around $62 after tax and it only let me pull out $60-80). I’ve never bothered to leave a review before either, so hopefully that shows you how pleased I was with this shop. I don’t see any reason to look into any other shops if you’re looking for a quick and easy piercing at a good price.

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>First time in, got a pair of cartilage piercings. Nice selection of jewelry. The piercing room was full of sunlight and very comfortable, and my piercer, Samantha, was funny and chill. That and her 13 years' experience made for a nice visit. I'll be back.

There is a $5 fee for paying with a card. They said cash was the other option so I guess I'll have to remember to bring some next time.

Update 2/2020: Went back to get help with a troubled piercing and the young guy said I needed to keep it cleaner and it would heal. It had already been a year. Came back two weeks later and he said I needed a longer post and I shouldn't have waited so long to get help. Annoying.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The best shop I've ever been to. Know their stuff. From the receptionist to the owner to PABLO I had the most welcoming experience of any shop I've been to. Pablo was so gentle and sweet as he helped me change out my jewlery. Will be back and I highly recommend.</Review>

<text>I just went to buy 2 earrings for my cartilage the box showed the price of $27 they charged $42 for each one which double bill came out to $94. Even when the lady was entering in the system she put a quantity of 2 each I asked her why so expensive she said it’s the stone. They are ripping people off different price shown and charged not happy.</text>< Pics>

<text>Beautiful place, clean, and friendly.  Very personable.  Helped my friend put her conch piercing back in.  VERY VERY expensive, but the pieces are so beautiful and unique, it's worth it for most to spend the extra (think $200-$700 for the jewelry alone) money.  I believe it's justified because of the quality of the pieces and the security knowing they're warrantied against defects. Beautiful lobby. They have a nest thermostat which to me showed they're tech savvy, had an ATM right in the store, and what looked like a garden out back. Really chill environment.</text>< user_id>

Honestly, I’m so disappointed with this shop. They sold me jewelry that didn’t fit even after I asked, “are you sure this isn’t too small.” The piercing was cutting into my skin so I had buy another piece which cost me a bunch of unnecessary money. Then I bought a pair of earrings and the lady must not have put them in correctly or the tread broke off because it fell out of my ear the same day I bought it. Buyers beware. I lost over a hundred bucks to this place.< /Text>

<Name>Heidi Besancon</Name><review>I loved Michael and the shop, it is amazingly well taken care of and they have a beautiful selection of jewelry. The piercing was absolutely flawless and the environment is one of the most professionally clean and sterilized I've been in. I have 3 complaints and those are why I didn't give them 5 stars. The first is out of their control, but parking was hard to find. The second is the girl working behind the counter. She had a really off putting demeanor and just her whole vibe was dismissive and aloof. Third, the pricing. Two upper ear cartilage piercings, with jewelry, was well over $300. I know that the upkeep of the shop, bills, equipment and jewelry pieces play huge into cost, but I was floored that it was that much. That being said, I'd go back every time because of our piercer and his skills, personality and excellent work.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Seems clean, knowledgeable, and aware of laws. Difficult if you're taking 2 of your kids for piercings, but show up and the sign on the door says, "no one allow in if 14 yrs. or under", and you have a younger child with you. You cant let 1 in to get her ears pierced, disappoint the younger child and stay outside with the younger child. Yet their website says "ear piercings for all ages", so it should be updated or explain how younger kids can get ears pierced. Parking is also a problem. Street parking or a little parking area that's hard to get in and out of.</Text><Name>Jason Cholwell< /Name></record>

<Text>Piercing Review!!
Drove a few hours just to get peirced by Pablo, and it was beyond worth the long drive. Professional, super, clean, and sterile spot and piercer. I got both my dimples peirced and the entire process was super smooth sailing.  They definetly take pride in their piercings offering an enormous selection of very fine body jewelry more pricey, but body jewelry should be people!!  Pablo was super kind and caring and well is it odd that I regret not leaving a bigger tip..? I am originally from San Diego where we have a huge range of selection when it comes to these shops and never have I been to one that just looks so dang impressive.  Highly recommend and if you ask me I would try to book Pablo, even though walk ins are welcomed.(yeah I walked in) There is no doubt in my mind that I will be back for Mr. Pablo.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

After reviewing The Exotic Body online, I went in yesterday to have two piercings done. I'm so glad I chose this place, they're a very well-run shop and were very knowledgeable. They were really busy (Friday afternoon, not a surprise at all), but attended to every customer in a timely manner without seeming rushed. My piercer Samantha was very professional, she talked me through the entire process while she was doing everything,  which put me at ease and made dealing with the pain a little easier. On the way out the woman at the front desk talked with me about aftercare and told me to call if I needed anything "instead of trying to internet search it" on my own. I actually did end up calling her a few hours later with another aftercare question, and she gave me all the information I needed.
I would definitely recommend this shop for piercings.< /Review>

Decided to get my speciality pericing done and after extensive research decided to come to The Exotic Body. The process went very well from start to finnish. I have to add that Samantha is very knowledgeable about everything from types of jewelry to the specifics about anything else you can possibly think of. She made sure the placement of my jewelry was to my liking and made the entire process very easy.
+1 for the jokes she made it eased my nervousness lol.  Thank you so much for everything! Sending a referral your way tomorrow!</review>

I had the worst experience here at first it was fine. Mike looked like he was knowledgeable.  Explained why I should and could only have a j curve belly ring and all this stuff and it made since at first.  He never went over the healing process or cleaning process had to buy my own cleaning solution which was only $3 so wasn't bad. if it wasn't for the sweetest reception lady there. (Never got her name) giving me a aftercare pamphlet I would have been screwed. after all that He  told me the price of the ring ($80+) all together my total was over $120 because of this j curve ring. Which because I wanted it so bad and had the guts to do it said okay let's do it not thinking I should look more into it. He mark the placement with me standing had me lay on the table not showing me where it was going to be placed and did the piercing. He was not gentle AT ALL I told him I was afraid of needle but really wanted to do this. Now we had already said and I already knew that my belly button is in an odd position so it might look a little strange. But it shouldnt look bad or off center.... boy was I wrong!!!! It was waaaaaay off center to much to the right, Was not straight was pieced sideway did not look ok. And no it was not because of the position of my bellybutton. Not only way the piercing terrible. But he was beyond rude to my friend that was with me who was getting her nose pierced by Mike also. Thankfully I contacted another piercer who told me to take it out and in a few weeks when its fully healed she will happily fix it for me at a great price. Thank you to her. But now I just spend $140 on a piercing that I had to take out because it was not good at all and will never be going there again. All that money down the drain. I gave him an $19 tip which I should not have tipped him at all but since I wanted to pay in advance and had no cash on me used my card. I just wish I could get a refund for this horrible piercing. Will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!! Do not come here at lest to Mike!!!!!</review>

First, I must say that I've visited this establish three times. Twice to buy jewelry and once for a piercing service. I didn't have so much of a problem with the jewelry nor the piercing.  The problem that I had was with the deceptive business practices of the gentleman that helped me who I think might've been the owner..  Each time I went in there, I asked if they accepted credit cards, I was told they do, however, this gentleman said that it would be cheaper if I paid in cash. It was at this point that he then said that they had an ATM machine there. Well I wasn't going to go to the bank and get money and come back so I used the ATM machine thinking that I would get a cash discount on the price of the jewelry or the service. I didn't on any of them, it was still the same price whether I paid in cash or by credit card.

Technically, he was not lying to me because it was cheaper for him but not me in that he didn't have to pay credit card fees and probably made either all or a portion of the ATM fees.  Granted it was my fault to believe him and return the 2nd and 3rd  time, but I am a trusting person and because of the location, the length of time it's been in business, it seemed like a reputable establishment.

All I have to say is caveat emptor, buyer beware.</review>

There is a lady at the front desk she's an apprentice with a piercing on her forehead everyone beware she is extremely rude and makes the business look bad just being the first person you see when you walk in. If you go in to get a piercing or tattoo ask to see an actual staff member and not her.</Text>

<UserId.>101796702627700156308< /UserId.><text>I've probably been to (and received treatment from) about 7 different dental offices around san diego county in my lifetime. With all the different offices I've experienced, I've never been able to find one that seemed like they genuinely cared about helping me prevent further problems from happening in the future. I'm extremely upset I didn't find Valentina and Adriatic sooner. Valentina is heaven sent - she never judges, is committed to educating about oral health, and listens to all my concerns. Her staff is very friendly, approachable, and is committed to all the same values that she is. Also, you won't find a nicer dental office in San Diego county. The facility is BEAUTIFUL and always spotless. I'll never go anywhere else! Thank you guys!< /text><time>1563300529845</time>< Pictures>

The office is significant, and air circulates well. It's one of those dental offices where you don't have to worry about Covid-19.< /Text>

I can not write enough about each and every person that is employed at Adriatic Dental. They are truly the most welcoming, kind and friendly staff that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. They make sure that you are comfortable, are aware of what they are going to be doing and do their absolute best to keep you comfortable and relaxed during your visit. I have never met a person who gets excited about a dental appointment, but the experience at Adriatic Dental is as close as I have ever felt about an appointment. One thing that I truly appreciate is that they will do whatever is possible to save your teeth rather than taking the easier route of pulling them. I would recommend this dental practice to anyone looking for a great dental experience. I would just like to thank each and every staff member for the kindness shown to me every time I have been there!!< /review>

The staff is absolutely pleasant and so kind.  The doctors here make you feel like they can fix whatever problem you have with your teeth.  It can at times be scary to go to a dentist but this team of staff and doctors make you feel so special.  I’ve been coming to them for over 2 years and it’s the best experience I have ever had from a dentist office.  Keep up the great work.  You guys rock.  The best ever.< /review>< pictures>

Booking an appointment at Adriatic Dental was very easy. I did it via a call, which saved me the time of having to go there physically for the appointment. Got a pretty good service too. I will be back.<//Text>

<text>If you're looking for a top notch dental team, Adriatic Dental is the place to be. Their expertise in the field shows in everything they do. From Stephanie at the front desk taking care of your scheduling and setting up your financing, to Dr. Obradovic, Dr. Boen, and Dr. Yazdi sending you off with your new beautiful healthy smile, you'll know you're in the most capable and caring hands dentistry has to offer. All the Doctors are true artists who will bring health and beauty back to your smile. Julian and Aaron will make sure you're comfortable throughout your visit. Blankets, protein shakes, even anxiety techniques and hand holding (which I have needed) are all generously provided. You're procedure won't begin until Debbie or Janet know that you are completely numb, which they begin with a topical gel to numb the gums before ever jabbing you with a needle. Seriously, you won't even feel the needle, these ladies know what they're doing. The entire team takes their time with you, you'll never feel like they're rushing through you to get to the next dollar sign. I've completed the laser treatments and all I can say is do it! It's worth it knowing that you are taking proactive measures to build back gum and bone, and Dr. Obradovic blazed the trail for laser gum therapy in California over a decade ago, so you know you're in good hands. These doctors will save every tooth they can, educate you on how to maintain your pearly whites, and keep you smiling.</text><date>1618874650720< /date><userid>108249230778954848753</userid>< response>

I came here as a new patient and first thing I noticed was how this office is the cleanest and safest Dental office I have seen and I have changed 4 Dentist offices this year so seen the different operations and different offices during COVID (some are NOT safe); this made me feel and know that I'm safe for myself and not taking anything back to my family and loved ones. You will also notice how nice and beautiful the office is with the most advance technology that have seen which makes other Dentist office look ancient. The receptionist are always welcoming. They took X-ray and intra oral pictures of my mouth. All of their equipment is state-of-the-art.

Cynthia did my cleaning, and I would recommend you ask for her because you can tell Cynthia is passionate about her job, very professional and knowledgeable. Definitely a great practice, which you will agree once you walk in.< /Text>

<review>As a new patient who hadn’t been to a dentist in a while, Adriatic Dental was wonderful in their ability to put you at ease, with no judging.  They just got to work with a thorough exam and set up a treatment plan which they patiently reviewed with me and answered all my questions.  The staff couldn’t have been nicer, frequently checking in on me and making sure I was comfortable.
From the front of the office, Medina, Milica, Patty, who helped with appointments to billing questions, to the clinicians in the back, Cynthia, Janet, Debby , Julian and Aaron , you were all friendly, efficient and professional .  Lastly a mention to Gigi and Drs Boen and Obradovic who managed to give me back my smile. I’ve always hated going to the dentist, going only when I absolutely had to, but,  this office makes it a lot easier. Thank you!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>They have a very friendly team of professionals. Keep up the good work guys. I will bring my kids for a dental checkup soon. Nayde at the front office was also amazing and so easy to help me schedule. She speaks Spanish, which was really nice to see a bilingual person here.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>Visits to the dentist rank pretty low on my scale of fun things to do, but I discovered years ago that lady dentists are so much more gentle and considerate than their male counterparts.  So when I needed a new dentist in Vista, I came across Dr Obradovic' s name, and made an appointment.  I am so glad I did. I actually ended up being treated by Dr Yazdi, who has to be the best, kindest and most thorough dentist I have had yet. In my 70+ years on this planet.

The whole team here is friendly, highly competent, and always punctual.  What more could you ask?</review>< Time>

The receptionist is very welcoming and was very friendly to my son. While driving there, he was a little tense, but after a chat with the receptionist, he eased up and was very ready to see the doc and have his teeth checked out.< /text>

The amount of infectious diseases the mouth can give is alarming.. also they seem to have a scheme vibe? About them go in for a check up they want to do more and more very pushy.. I did not have a comfortable experience and being a 73 year old vet I dont need that stress. Like anyone else....< /Review>< resp>

Valentina Obradovic is the most amazing there is! she’s of something so special I originally came with a detached bridge I was starting to get infection underneath in my gums and I had an absolute emergency situation she not only reattached what was there she rebuilt everything , rebuilt my whole front teeth and made it more beautiful and stronger than the first time.  She did better than I could’ve ever hoped! Her service and her caring is absolutely second to none! I recommend her in the highest degree, please come see her!!</Review>

I was treated for gum disease at Adriatic Dental, and in less than a week, the bleeding was gone. A month later, most of the painful swelling that caused me so much pain was a thing of the past.</Review>

I received gum treatment before it ballooned into a more serious problem, all thanks to their use of intraoral cameras. I didn’t even know such a thing exists until I visited Adriatic Dental.<//review>

<Text>I had a bad experience with a dentist while in my teenage years and it kinda made me afraid of dentists. However, last month I had to seek help for persistent gum problems. I checked into this facility imagining the worst but was given a very warm welcome. Everyone was friendly to me, and it made me overcome my fears. I have since become their regular client for dental checkups. Keep up the good work guys.<//Text>< resp>

You can try them out. I was treated there for a severe gingivitis case, and the issue hasn’t recurred in a while. They are very professional.</Review>

I was amazed how immediately one is made comfortable by the entire team!!  No matter what issue brings you in, they were embracing you as if you were the one they were waiting for, to perform their miracle, and have your best interest at heart.  I highly recommend having all your dental work completed here.  Again, cannot say enough about the warmth and caring staff!!  Thank you!!<//review>

Came in one day and they fixed my smile in one day right then!  Amazing.  They obviously love what they do, and their craftsmanship is fabulous.  You won't be disappointed.

Update:  it's been a year now and the service at Adriatic Dental continues to be amazing.  Cheerful staff, quality work, great availability for appointments, good followup, and strong insurance awareness.  Always a pleasure.< /text>

Julian advised me to undergo a tooth filling procedure instead of extracting a tooth that had been nagging me for days. Since undergoing the procedure, the dull pain that was giving me sleepless nights is gone.< /text>

Please don’t believe whatever they said on here. Go check on the yelp reviews !!!   This is horrible place . I look at the google reviews first  that’s why it got me. I paid $157 for first visit. Some people got charged for $12000. That is crazy. They pushy you do everything right there. You don’t even have to make an appointment. They overcharged by nothing done for you. They will tell you the teeth problem that you don’t even have. Please stay away from this dirty place. PS: you will see the tools that they in your mouth are rust and dirty< /text>

<Text>I had a great visit here with my dentist, Im honestly not a fan of getting my teeth worked on but when I went it my perspective completely changed! The staff is incredible and so welcoming. They offered me a blanket, juice, crackers etc...  they explained everything they were going to work on and my results were great! Definitely recommend this dental office I want to thank them for helping me with my fear of getting work done on my teeth and for making me feel confident to smile!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I have been a patient of Dr. Obradovic and Adriatic Dental & Orthodontics since 2011. I came to them after a career in the Navy and Dental work that was readiness-driven in ensuring you were deployment ready. Dr O and her kind and caring team (they even mail their patients birthday notes etc.) have helped correct so many dental issues that unknowingly were also negatively impacting my medical health in various ways. I am not one that does this often, but his experience has been life-changing for me, so I therefore give them my highest endorsement.< /Text><username>Richard Ross<//username><Rate>5< /Rate>< pics>

<time>1564115145769< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I’ve been a patient of Adriatic dental for almost 15 years . I had a lot of problems and fear of going to a dentist.
Specifically I had a broken bridge and it was quite late at night almost 6:30 pm and Dr. Valentina took me in after hours and spend about two hours with her superb team and they fixed my bridge and replaced it immediately
My pain was gone and I was a happy patient and I went home so appreciative of the help that I got that night !! Thank you to all the staff of Adriatic.
Whenever I had a problem I am sure I will have the best help.I am forever grateful to Dr Valentina and her wonderful staff .< /Review>< Pics>

Of all the dentist office I've ever been to I've learned more here. I understand more now, since finding Adriatic Dental, about keeping my gums and teeth cleaned! It amazes me that none of my previous dentist spent as much time teaching me these things, coming to Dr. Obradovic's office I feel cared for and important, I'm not just a number.< /Text>

I come in every 6 weeks for my DNA retainer, and I look forward to it each time. Everyone working there treats me like family, which wasn’t something I could say about my previous dentist’s office. The appointments are fast, easy, and no BS!<//Review>

What a blessing to have found this Dentistry!
I never thought I'd ever feel so comfortable and relaxed at a dentist office, this team of doctors go above and beyond in customer satisfaction. Upon arriving your checked in by the friendly administrators who are always so bubbly. Then brought back to the infamous dentist chair, where they accommodate you with a fuzzy blanket or refreshments. They then explain in detail the procedure, answering any questions along the way. I have learned so much, and have overcome my anxiety of the dentis. (♡also appreciate that they reccomend natural products such as thieves for mouthwas . ♡)
I am definitely the easiest patient having not gone to the dentist in years I had alot of work to be done, on top of my transportation, and personal issues causing my schedule to be everywhere. Even so, this office has shown me nothing but compassion and understanding, I cant express my gratitude enough to find such a caring dentist.
(My mother, brother, and 6yr old daughter have also all recieved top quality care with nothing but good things to say. )
We all recommend this office for their high standard of customer care.< /text>

<Review>When I came into Dr. Obradovic’s office I was so frightened of the dentist, sweaty palms, crying and nervous. I hadn’t been to a dentist In probably four years at least and I have to say that my fear of dentistry is truly gone with the help of Dr. O and her team. The results are amazing, my new veneers are more than I ever expected!They are a dream come true!< /Review>< user_name>

Thank you Dr. Obradovic for saving my life. If it weren’t for you, I would have never known that I had sleep apnea. I am very thankful that you noticed something and referred me to get tested. Everyone should get tested for sleep apnea, it will truly save your life. Also a big thank you to Lindsay, my new hygienist, she made me feel so comfortable and I will follow my instructions of coming every 3 months to see her, all the way from Valley Center.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>i went to the office and i was shocked by the look of the office it looked beautiful and i was told by an other dentist to get a crown but dr obradovic was able to save my tooth with a nice white filling that looks exactly like a natural tooth and i never felt anything while they were working on it and i almost fell asleep because the music was soothing and they gave me a blanket but they staff was great and very comforting  and it was a very pleasant experience overall i love going to the dentist now thank you Adriatic Dental  i’ll recommend you guys to all my friends< /Review>< pictures>

They’ve helped me get that fire back that I needed and know exactly how to level up your skills! If you are on the edge of wanting to try boxing, Mui Thai, or Brazilian jujitsu Champions gym Is the way to go no doubt.

Incredible gym to learn martial arts, get into shape and meet great people. The coaching staff is the best and make sure that everyone is involved and constantly improving. Great environment for all ages, if you have any interest in boxing, jiu jitsu or Muay Thai I highly recommend that you stop by and check out the classes!< /Review>

<review>Made an appointment for 9am May 29th. We called earlier in the week and were told to come on Saturday at 9am. We came and the gym was closed. We called both numbers listed on the website and no one answered at one number while the other was disconnected. I emailed them as well and the email on the website is no longer valid either. Complete waste of our time.< /review>< date>

{'time': 1612900319027, 'text': "Hi Good, morning Chris we do want you as a customer unfortunately we don't see your name on our caller i.d however we do see quite a few blocked calls not sure if one of those are yours. If you provide us with a number we will call you right back.\nThis month we have been enrolling a lot of new members and getting tons of calls so please don't take it personal. You can also go on our website www.championsbjj.com and opt in for one of our Free trials just make sure to put your name and phone number on the opt in box and one of our coaches will co- tact you immediately with more information. Hope we can somehow get a hold of you soon.\nBest Regards\nChampions Staff 🤙"}</Resp>

Not sure where all these good reviews came from but they sure fooled me.
My husband and I brought my 12 year old sister tonight to try their kickboxing class but the coach teaching the class never once corrected anyone or taught them any formation etc. The coach kept leaving and talking to others instead of focusing on the students.
The students weren't very welcoming either. The little girl partnered with my sister kept rolling her eyes and being rude. They eventually asked for help from another student (also rude). WHY??? Where is the coach to help and correct them??? They weren't understanding of the fact that it was her first time taking a class and did not make her feel welcome. How does this place have any clientele?
All the coaches were too young to have any credibility. Even the guy training jiu jitsu was only a purple belt.
I'm so disappointed because she was really excited.<//review>

I came from North Carolina I didnt know anyone or had any friends besides my co workers but there really not my friends just co workers, anyways I'm truly grateful I joined this class, I was motivated to learn different styles of fighting such as mui tai,Brazilian jiu jitzu and boxing. I was nervous cause I didn't know anybody but you gotta go in there with a great attitude and an urge to learn , yes I was shy and yes I was afraid to be the new guy coming in but we all go through it , the staff was really friendly because I was hungry to learn and I was asking questions and I wasnt afraid to go with the big guys . I met so many people and tbh we are all there to have fun and learn. The staff with no hesitation at all will work with you when it comes to signing up or even  struggling financially or even when you got a complaint . Just be honest and don't take them for granted . 🤷‍♂️😄</Review>

Great place to train at! The coaches share their knowledge and expertise with humility and understanding. With 1 membership you have the opportunity to explore multiple mixed martial arts disciplines. The teamwork and sense of community that is fostered at Champions is an essential piece of what makes Champions such an incredible place to be a part of. The atmosphere and energy level brought to each class by fellow gym participants and advanced athletes encourages you to push yourself and strive to better by the end of each class. At Champions it’s a comfortable place to come in as a beginner. I was new to Boxing, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jui Jitsu. I came to this location as a beginner with zero experience, and started with Boxing and Muay Thai but was intrigued by what I saw during the Jiu Jitsu classes. I was hesitant to dive into Jiu Jitsu because I felt that I didn’t know enough. I began attending the all women’s Jiu Jitsu classes on Friday evenings and became comfortable enough to integrate into the co-Ed beginner classes during the week.

Whether you’re just looking to get in shape or are interested in advancing your skill level, the staff at Champions acknowledge the consistency and hard work put forth by each student. The coaches will help you progress and achieve your goals based on your effort level and individual desires. Regardless of your reason for working out Champions is a great place to push yourself and have fun while doing it.<//review>

I had been searching for a facility that would offer a friendly and inviting environment. I wanted to focus on my fitness goals and not worry about the workouts being set up for men and women of multiple levels. I also did not want to worry about rushing to get to class and not arriving early enough to get a spot. Champion's Women's Only Boot Camp offers great class options and superior coaching support. I highly recommend the multiple programs and classes offered here.</review>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I live in Pasadena and have searched for, and visited, schools in many of the surrounding cities. I reached out to Champions, and right away, I knew that I found a home. Coaches, staff, and students all make this place feel like home and family. Everyone is very knowledgeable, passionate, patient, and caring. Whether you are advanced, or a beginner with no prior experience, every person associated with this school is invested in your personal growth, and will work closely with you individually to help you reach your goals. Don’t take my word for it, check it out for yourself (they offer a free trial) and I’m certain that your experience will be the same. I cannot thank Champions enough for taking me in, and having such a positive impact on my life!<//Text><UserId.>106536344987663059477</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80c3283a17bb6fc9:0x2d79fe4adaae8faf</gmap_id>< Resp>

At 1st i was sceptical thinking it was some sort of sales gimmick like ive experienced in the past but to my surprise it wasnt. The gentleman who helped me explained all their options and gave me the option of enrolling or taking the 30 day trial. I opted for the trial bc my son tends to lose interest farely quickly. Without hesitatiin i was awarded a 30 day free trial pass and my son was given a prety cool shirt for free. Fast foward 30 days later we are still here and just enrolled my son to officially be part of the champions family. 100% satisfied.

Best BJJ school in the area trust me I've checked most of them. Family friendly environment no egos not a sink or swim school they actually teach you the basics step by step. I felt welcomed the minute I stepped inside the school. I have no idea why someone who's not even a student would give a bad review check for yourself this is a good school with good people.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I started training bjj at Champions 10 months ago and I absolutely love it! My general fitness has improved--I'm stronger, quicker, and more flexible than I was when I began--and I feel more confident in my ability to defend myself. The atmosphere at the gym is very positive and friendly. The coaches are super knowledgeable and spend time with people individually to make sure everyone understands the techniques. The classes are challenging but the coaches are very supportive and make training enjoyable...usually ;) Sometimes as a woman it can be intimidating being in a mostly male environment, but everyone at Champions makes me feel comfortable and welcome and there are often several other females to train with. And for those women who prefer to do the all female thing, there is a women's only bootcamp class with a fantastic instructor! I am very happy with my experience at Champions both on and off the mat and would recommend this gym to anyone interested in learning a martial art or getting fit!!!<//review>< pictures>

<text>I recently moved back to covina and was recommended this school by another teammate. It is a very well rounded school and also has a women's program and children's classes that will accelerate your kids to the next level of jiu jitsu. Great family environment. The school also caters to kids and adults with special needs. I have never heard of a school doing that but I feel it's a great step forward to inspire other schools to follow suit.<//text>< date>

<Review>Been at Champions almost a year now, and I couldn't recommend it more! They have a fantastic new facility with a full-size boxing ring, heavy bags, and a large jiu jitsu mat area. They have a nice family atmosphere with a friendly, caring and skillful coaching staff -- and a great group of students, too! Come check out a free trial, or drop by the 11:30am Saturday open mat!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

My son started at the old location, a month after they opened. Jiu jitsu has truly changed him and our family. He is more confident and very disciplined. The staff is amazing and they truly care about everyone that walks through that door.
Not only are they awesome instructors but they also make sure your kids are doing good in school and if they misbehave at home the coaches will take care of that too.
I can't imagine going to another gym, champions has become a part of our family.< /Review>

Great place to train very clean and professional, yet everyone is welcoming and willing to lend a hand. A lot of schedule options and are open to working something out for you to make sure you can come in. Evryone is friendly and so far its been alot of fun training with the various coaches. It really feels like a community and want to see you succeed, rather than just a place that is trying to shuffle people in and out as fast as possible to bring in more profit.< /Text>

Best academy of its kind anywhere around, great facilities, world class instructors and a family friendly environment. I live in Claremont and I drive past at least half a dozen schools to get to champions because all schools are not created equally!!!<//Text>

Very well organized and welcoming teachers that we have here. My experience so far has been great. Champions is a remarkable gym that teaches many fight-based sports such as boxing, muay thai, and brazilian jiu jitsu.. I take part in all of these martial arts and have learned a lot from the many instructors that this gym has. They’re not just teachers but have grown to become apart of my martial arts family. Thank you</Text>

(Translated by Google) It is undoubtedly one of the best Jiujitsu academies and varied martial arts in Southern California. Clean and familiar environment ... The gym is super spacious and even though more than one class is rolling at the same time, you do not feel invaded or squeezed. The Tatame is huge.
In JiuJitsu classes the heating is strong, the rolas are bravas ... Even loose is bravo there.
The class is varied, there is room for everyone, man, woman, child.
Train with them, you will not regret it.

Nas aulas de JiuJitsu o aquecimento é forte, os rolas são brabos... Até soltinho é brabo ali.
A classe é variada, tem espaço pra todo mundo, homem, mulher, criança.
Treinem com eles, você não vão se arrepender.

Awful service. I scheduled an appointment to recalibrate for 8:30am I drive out 45 min to arrive at 830 and apparently they didn't know and I waited until 9:15 for someone to arrive. Their mailbox is always full. My bestie needed to get her interlock device and I told her whatever you do. Don't use draegers nor use 1st interllock to install anything.... so unprofessional...so disappointed 😞  in general draegers installations will forget about their appointments.... 3 different people I dealt with.. all had me waiting for over 30 min<//text>

<Review>Honestly getting my dui was scary and the thought of having a breathalyzer was even scarier. I was super nervous and didn't know anything about where to get it installed. When I found this place I was so relieved. He is super chill and very informative and doesn't judge. Anytime I had questions or needed to come in, he was always so nice and understanding. Definitely recommend to anyone that needs to install the breathalyzer. Never getting a dui again BUT I know where to come if i ever did and can assure myself I'd be in good hands!!

After months of searching and comparing different companies I spoke with Mike who was beyond helpful. By far the best company to deal with. They worked with me to try to find the best solution for my situation. I had an out of state DUI and they worked with me and even filed my paperwork which was for out of state. I have to have it for 4 years and I have no regrets. Always recommend them if I ever hear anyone say they got a DUI. Thanks 1st Interlock. You guys are the best!<//Review>

Unsure about where to go for the service and what device to choose among the many out there, I took some time to read reviews and found consistency with the Drager product, and with this company. And I'm glad I did. I had no unwanted issues with the device and had a very positive experience with 1st Interlock employees in terms of customer service and technical questions. In short, they were professional, knowledgeable, helpful throughout my five months of having used the device. Thanks!< /Text>

As unfortunate as it is to have an ignition interlock, 1st Interlock made the entire process much easier and less demeaning.  Mike is great and super helpful.  The device is simple and user-friendly and the message screen is great! It notifies you of any issues and gives you 5 days to take it in to the service center to verify what is going on.  I definitely recommend this provider to anyone needing to take care of an interlock requirement in the area.  You WON'T be disappointed!<//text>

My trip to 1st interlock today was a good experience.  Mike gave excellent and very helpful information on how to use the interlock.  He had patience to practice with me and how to use it properly. I had forgot and left something behind and he called me to inform me and was a totally good person to return it to me himself.  Now a days it's rare to find a company that really gives the service and attention I received today.  Thank you Mike.     Rose Cortez< /text>

I called so many companies trying to find an interlock company to use, and when Mike answered the phone, I knew I'd found the person with whom I would do business. Mike was the first person I'd talked to that day (after about 12 calls) that sounded human and that cared. He was kind and calm and helpful and answered my "many" questions with patience and intelligence, and can I say again, kind and calm.

I have been using his service for almost two months and have had not one single issue. When I had question first using the device, Mike was there! Mike answered the phone on a Saturday, when he wasn't feeling well to answer my call and answer a question! That's the kind of service you get with this company! Mike is ALWAYS there and helpful and kind and calming.

It means so much to find good people doing business who have personal standards that permeate all they do and how they conduct themselves when doing business. Mike is a real find, especially when you have to deal with issues like Interlock devices and the DMV, etc. He and his company are the bright spot in the whole experience!

Thank you, Mike!!!< /text>

<review>Both Mike and Margarita at 1st Interlock are really friendly! The interlock device itself is very easy to use. I also had the option to re-calibrate every month or 2 months.

After my first interlock place went out of business they helped me go through the rest of my 5 months. They are fast and very friendly! I would recommend them to everyone. They accept cash or card which really worked out for me since I never carry cash on me! Great service and worked flexible with the times I needed around work. 😊< /Review>

<Review>First interlock has always treated me right. They take my payments online and I just show up to the nearest location I have near me here in North Hollywood. There was an issue once when my direct deposit didn't go through the night before and first interlock still helped me calibrate my vehicle a day after without any extra late fee charge.. Thank you 1st interlock for your great and helpful assistance</Review>< pics>

<Text>So unprofessional.. This message I received from him. After him stealing from us an extra month. The dmv said you are aware of the dates that each of your clients require.

Hello Shirley, the interlock is for your boyfriend and he was not double charged. His monthly rate that we even came to a deal with at the time of install is the same rate of the pro-rate for the amount of days he has had the device after his original install date. The only attitude came from your boyfriend when he threatened me over the phone. Also we do not appreciate you stealing our Mouthpieces from our North Hollywood location from the drawer and denying it when you were caught in the act.</Text><userid>103462217564925476916</userid></record>

This company does not value customer service and believes it has captive customers. The company is only open from 8-5 m-f, so if you have a job you'll have to miss work to get your monthly service. My mechanic locked me out while working on my car overnight and I was told to pay 140$ to get unlock codes. They suggested I bill Honda for the charges! Please choose another company, you do have a choice of interlock provider!< /Text>

<text>Hidden fees they charge you for the entire month even thou you only need it for half the month. And my traction control light and engine light on my Lexuz has bin on Ever since they installed the interlock, I’m hoping it goes away once its removed.. which it never did now I can’t pass the smog test !!. The interlock device ruined the computer on my Lexuz and they did not want to do anything about it!! The ltraction control and and chenck engine light came on after I drove off from the interlock shop  I took it back and mike didn’t want to do anything about it.. I messed up in not staying there untill they fixed it!!.  Here’s the code to what  comes up in the scanner and your telling me  that has nothing to do with the interlock IGNITION.?  C1201 Engine control system malfunction ??!  Oh yeah and Fail test for eating bread or drinking cranberry juice or eating a  Green Apple or smoking mint cigarette 10 min before blowing in the Device smh .. another thing everything in the my engine is connected to the brain (computer)of my car so you had to connected something to my car in order for the interlock to work in my car .< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>
{'time': 1535647125265, 'text': 'Adelfo, you were charged for a whole month of service because you had stated you were eligible for removal on a specific date; however DMV said you were not eligible until the following month which was 18 days away. If we pro-rated your month of service it would have equaled $90 plus tax for the month rather than the $78.03 with tax that you pay. All of our fees are clearly printed on the first page of our contract. The 7 failed tests you had on your device are the only additional fees you paid with us. As for your vehicle, you were with us for just over a year and not once did you mention anything about a check engine light on your car, also our device does not connect to your vehicles computer nor does it have anything to do with your vehicle failing SMOG sir.'}</resp>

Very profesional! Having an interlock installed in your vehicle is a bad deal as it is, but at least you don't have to deal with people that would take advantage of you at 1st interlock. The DMV recently hit me with an added year. I searched around and got all types of off the wall rates and hidden fees. Real scetchy individuals. In the end, 1st interlock remains the best candidate with the best rates and easiest device. As long as you comply with the schedule, your term will fly smoothly.</review>

Although I was not the one who needed the interlock, I can say that Mike was very professional and made the process go very smoothly, even with a keyless ignition. Hopefully nobody is in a position to need an interlock, but if you are, I can’t recommend this place enough!</review>

I do recall you saying that you had no money because of being locked up and you losing your job. I was more than willing to work with you on payment but you stated that you would have someone remove the interlock illegally if I didn't take it out."}< /response>

The food was edible but no where near great the rice was like mashed potatoes and the bowl smelt like a pier and stunk up the entire shop I usually don’t feel a need to review but I decided to make an exception< /Text>

<text>Like the food, don’t like the fact that I pay extra for a couple scoops of Edamame and extra scoop of cucumber and I get one scoop of Jalapeños. So I only get like 5 scoops of toppings. But I could get 1 scoop of everything which would be like 20 scoops and not pay extra. I used to tip before I seen the extra charges, but no more tip from me now.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1613794096119, 'text': 'Hi Eric, I’m so sorry to hear that you feel that way. Unfortunately many people have decided to get 5 or more of one topping which would have us lose out on profit which made us have to make this hard decision. So please do not take this out on the employees due to the tip goes 100% to them. Again this was a decision a small business had to make in hard times. Again I am so sorry to see you give us one star due to this but as a business we have to do what is best. Thanks for your understanding.\nLauren\nLoco Poke Management'}< /Resp>

This was our second time at Loco Poke and still is awesome as the first time. Just a little heads up though, a little sauce goes a long way, so don't overdo it! If you like a bunch of different flavors, just do a little bit of the sauce will do ya! You don't want to drown out the flavors of the proteins and the toppings!</text>

This is a fantastic little place to eat especially on those hot summer days. The fish was FRESH and they have a large selection of toppings There serving sizes are large and there are plenty of sauces to choose from.  Absolutely recommend a visit to this place. The service and cleanliness is outstanding and you can't top the freshness of all the food. Five Stars< /review>

Poke Nachos....Yes, I said Poke Nachos! I had them today and they were great.  Think extra large crispy wontons plus poke bowl minus the rice.  It was crunchy goodness :-) I had a chance to talk with the new owners today as well and they were very nice people. I would add a picture if I hadn't scarfed it down before I thought about it. Highly recommend.  They also have teriyaki bowls and what not for folks that don't do raw fish.<//review>

I originally scheduled a hitch installed at this location about 1 week out on the uhaul website, drove 1 hour to a how up for the appointment, and there was no tech on site. I called uhaul and they said someone would call me. No one did. The appointment was changed to 2 weeks later at 9 am. I dropped the car off at 9, they said it would be done by 2, but knowing the pattern so far, I called at noon and they said not until 5 now. This is AFTER I told them I’d be waiting in town since I lived so far away. I show up at 5 and the car is now pushed back to 7. No one called, etc. The service is so bad that I’m afraid to use the hitch. They said the manager will call me tomorrow. I won’t bet on it. Go anywhere else!</review>

I think we’re all used to seeing the call button being broken, no big deal I can walk up to the building. it’s a bit annoying however to make the walk and then be told “it ain’t gonna happen man” when I ask about getting propane filled. Evidently it was only the guy manning the counter and another guy. I gave the suggestion that they could add a note at the propane fill about not filling propane and I got a dirty stare as though that was way too much to ask. Constrained criticism is that he could be said that it may take a bit to get to me since they were short staffed and not flat flat out denying me service.

To be fair, when I was entering the store he was on the phone phone with a lady and seemed a tad nicer saying why he couldn’t go look for whatever it was she called about.<//review>< Pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>It’s always terrible. If you actually want to pick up your rental anywhere near the scheduled pickup time show up an hour early. There’s always a line and it moves at about 1 customer every 15 minutes. I’ve been in line for about 20 minutes and there are 6 people in front of me. The three customers I’ve overheard so far are all trying to figure out why the truck they reserved is not here. Does not bode well for me.< /Text>< pictures>

I needed to rent a pickup truck to haul some stuff to the county dump. I stopped by two other u haul places and struck out. A person at one of the places gave me a  e tral phone number for uhaul and they did alltthe work. AllI had.to.dk was go there and use the QR scanner on my phone.and on.my drivers license.and drive away. The lady at the counter was helpful and fun to talk with.<//text>

I called to make the appointment to install a trailer hitch and brake controller ... the sales person I spoke with did not understand the difference between a flat four connector and a 7 pin connector ... so after explaining why I needed the 7 pin the sales slip I received in an email still said 4 pin and no controller .... I called right back and spoke with the sales person from my previous call then he handed me off to an installer...,who got it and spec'd what I needed; but I never received a new email confirmation....a week later my daughter makes the 1.5 hour trip for our appointment ... only to be told the hitch did not come in and they don't have time anyway... I had an appointment... they should have called.. so we set another appointment for a week later..  my daughter gets there and calls me because they're trying to tell her I ordered a 4 pin connector ... she is not a professional trailering expert like the Techs an U Haul but she knows what she needs ..I also had told them she would be waiting for the truck ... one hour install .. she waited 4hrs ...,billed 1 hour install.. because that's all it took.. so I get home after work and omg .. they put a well used 7 pin connector on the truck and drilled a hole through the step on the bumper to put one of the two required mounting bolts .. so the head of the bolt is under the bumper and there is 3/4" of bolt and nut sticking up through the bumper on the step ... so if you step on the "step" you get a bolt through your foot .. they're completely inept ..  go anywhere else these are not experts they're hacks.  No management or oversight ..  I should have canceled my appointment the first time they messed up my order.<//review>

If your here reading the comments before picking up a truck, let me tell you that you are in for a bad time. Reserved a 20' truck a week before coming in and they didn't have it at all. I spent 3 hours here waiting to see if they could have another truck ready, but customer service here does not care for you. I ended up having to go to another place to find a smaller truck. Again. If you are here to know how the service is, its complete garbage. Best this place can do is sell you boxes and tape, for trucks good luck. Your gonna be waiting HOURS.< /Text>

<Text>My friend had already been inside the office and discussed his need with staff.. I came to meet him and help purchase the rental.. staff knew he was waiting on me.. I arrived before closing time and we sat waiting while staff was busy with other clients. Closing time arrived. We sat waiting. 15 minutes later, the same employee that assisted my friend an hour earlier told us we were out of luck for renting a uhaul truck that day. WHAT??? We were inside before closing! We waited 30 min to be told NO! We waited patiently while other clients were helped and we are told 15 min after closing that there is no way a rental is going to happen today! Seriously! We could have been told when we walked in, we could have been told when the door was locked. This irresponsible employee should be fired for seemingly on purpose wasting our time, not renting to us and therfore ruining my friends plans for using the truck that day.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808449230d60f93f:0xfc2967f4d6c03378<//Gmap_id></record>

Serving the general public, especially on a moving day, is a job for a therapist.   Eva, who manages the U-Boxes went far beyond expectations, anticipated what I needed, having everything ready before I had the chance to ask.  Its a well oiled machine there.   Her colleagues are the same and I would hope U-Haul Corporate would consider this location as a training site.   I will definitely be using their services the next time.<//Review>

That's it for me. I'm through with U-Haul. The rude obnoxious treatment I received from Don Sheldon was beyond unacceptable. I would never have been talked to or treated like this if I were a  man. I am outraged. The skinny snotty lazy boys in their dirty shirts, busy smoking cigarettes could have helped, but they didn't. What a bunch of losers. Just don't go there.</text>

Worst customer service ever. Gentleman from southern Califormia here in our county for over a decade. Was rude and condescending to everyone. People calling get hung up on. Spoken to rudely and he acts as if he's better than anyone. I asked his name he refused. Asked for managers card and was refused. Then ignored.
Worst experience in over 30 years of doing business with uhaul.
Never again!< /review>

The general manager of this store is a horrible person to deal with. We had to wait 2 hours to pick up a trailer that we reserved days in advance and when the paperwork had to be filled out and there were questions he was argumentative and blamed everything on us when we were only asking questions and confused because the website doesn’t make things clear. I don’t know if Don Sheldon was having a bad day or has a bad life but he certainly takes it out on his customers.< /Text>

The worst, most unnecessary and  illogical experience I’ve ever had with a place of business. I was repeatedly lied to, hung up on, ignored and treated terribly. The details are many and not worth reciting in this review, but to summarize I spent over 15 hours on the phone with U-Haul corporate, 5 hours in the location’s lot, sent 15 emails, and left innumerable voicemails all to gain access to boxes which we paid $2400 to ship across the country. The general manager Don Sheldon is doing a disservice to U-Haul and the community he operates in by mistreating customers and ignoring guidance from corporate and his superiors. Their poor reputation is throughly known by other U-Haul locations in Santa Rosa, U-Haul operations and others. Avoid this location at all costs. U-Haul, this location should be audited and Don should be removed from his post. You’ll find details in the four complaints I filed to U-Haul. To boot, employees are not wearing masks when they interact with customers.< /Review>

<response>None<//response><review>Terrible customer service. I called and apparently the reception was not good. The person on the other end yelled at me, hung up and then when I called back on a landline, picked up and hung up again. I get that technological problems are annoying but there’s no need to be rude. If I didn’t already have an order under way with things already shipped, I definitely would not choose this company.< /review><GmapID>0x808449230d60f93f:0xfc2967f4d6c03378<//GmapID>< time>

<Review>The worst costumer service experience I’ve ever had in my entire life - to the extent that it seemed oddly personal. We were denied access to my Ubox - even after getting a notarized letter saying we could open and take it. We were lied to that there were no trailers - there was a perfectly functional one on display. We spent over 8 hours over the course of 3 days trying to get our stuff so we could move in and have a bed to sleep on. The woman at the counter was rude, passive aggressive, and flat out mean. She was literally texting another employee about me in front of me, which was obvious because the other employee wasn’t down with it and was trying to get her to say what she wanted aloud so I would also hear it. The manager, Don, should be fired - his unhelpfulness and aggression were disgusting for someone in a position of power. Finally - NOBODY WAS WEARING A MASK! We have immune compromised parents and now need to get tested due to all our interactions with them.</Review>< Name>

If you can avoid this location, do it at all cost. If not, make sure they scan the returned equipment right in front of you. Otherwise, like others have said down below, they'll charge you for extra days/mileage/fuel. Don't let them get away with "just leave the keys in the vehicle and we'll take care of it".<//text>

*Update*
Contacted by a corporate office who are in the process of resolving the situation. Added a few stars.
—
Everything was fine until my invoice was emailed to me the next day. There were 3 incorrect charges and multiple contacts to try and resolve. I was charged for things I didn’t rent... $10 for pads, $10 for a dolly and an extra day fee of $29.95 when I returned the truck at 7p the same day I rented it as agreed in my contract. This is highly suspicious. Disputing the $49.95 with my cc company. What a pain, never had an issue with U-Haul before, likely won’t use them again unless I can get my final receipt immediately on return, the guy at the lot was so busy I said emailing the receipt was fine.

I made a reservation for a trailer at this location, was told I could pick it up after 10am, showed up at 12:30: no trailer. They cancelled my reservation, gave the trailer to someone else and never even bothered to call me, email me, text me or communicate in any way. They basically screwed my entire moving. Very poor communication skills, and not honoring the reservation. They suck! Do not count on this for your moving day</review>

All bad....no communication from them regarding my hitch install fiasco that I had to eventually just cancel along with my vehicle dolly reservation.  If they don't want my money that is fine, I will be happy to find someone who does. WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!! Recommend you find another location to help with your moving needs.<//review>

<Text>The staff in the store were excellent representatives,

Very friendly Easy to work with and knowledgeable!

The reason I am giving a 4 star rating is that the truck was in terrible running condition!!!
We went 30 miles and it used over a half a tank of gas!!
The mirrors were stuck so it was impossible to drive safely.
The front seat had a Big hole in it and the seat was stuck so I was unable to adjust it!
Last but not least the Check Engine light came on!!!< /Text>< GmapID>

<Text>I was happy with the front desk young woman that helped me. She was very nice. The tall, blonde gentleman that helped me hook up my trailer was also very kind and helpful. The only unfortunate thing was that one of the straps keeping my car secured to the trailer came loose on my first day of travel. I had to fix it when I noticed it was completely off the wheel the next morning. A young guy helped me with that particular wheel. He seemed a bit flustered. I'm glad everything was ok during my trip.<//Text>< username>

Don is a complete jack off! I had reservations to get hitch and trailer, they rescheduled my hitch install for a week even though I was picking up a trailer the very next day for a cross country move. I explained I could not do it and was scheduled for that Friday even though I told them I was to be completely moved from my place by Friday. I ended up having to go to Oakland to get the hitch, Don explicitly stated he was sorry and he would make sure I got my trailer that night and he would be there until 8. I arrived at 7:40.. and it had been one hectic day due to this location. Don was standing inside the store at the register with the door locked and wouldn’t come over to the door at first, once he did he told me he already started counting his drawer and company policy states he can’t let me in now. I told him I don’t need to come in and if he could just take my card and let me be on my way that would be great... he began yelling at me saying he never told me I had until 8... if I could have reached through that glass and grabbed that inefficient, cocky SOB...  DO NOT USE THIS LOCATION!!!!!</text>

< Review>
Probably the worst experience I have ever had at any business. I stopped by to buy a package of wrapping paper. The shelf price said it was $5.95, but when they rang it up on the computer they wanted to charge me $6.95. I said I wanted to get the shelf price because that is the price that was presented to me as a customer. Just like any other business would, but they said I'd have to pay what the computer said, and then I could open up a complaint with corporate customer service. I called customer service while I was at the store, and after 30 minutes, they finally got somebody in the store to give me the advertised price that was on the shelf. I know it's only a dollar, but if they could not use common sense for the benefit of the customer over a measly dollar, can you imagine what kind of problems you would have here, if say for example you brought a truck back one second past the time it was due, they would charge you for another day. Bottom line, you could be in a world of hurt if you ever rent something from this location. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one star is because corporate customer service came through and honored the price on the shelf.<//Review>

First off! the general manager likes to bully women!
Rents a truck with no license plate! My girl then gets harassed by the local sheriff's and when she calls it in to uhaul the general manager accuses her of stealing it off the truck!
He is rude! Pushy! And certainly over reacts to normal everyday situations!
And just because he has communication problems and lies. Promised to cover the gas for the inconvenience of having to return and switch trucks. Then reniggs on the deal and charges her for everything he has power to charge her for.
Well just be careful  doing business there! When less then a mile away you can rent from enterprise!< /Text>

Reserved a 15' box online, a uhaul rep even called to make sure that I would get the truck I need. My girlfriend and dad get there and no truck is available. They wait for 4 hours and try to rent us a van when a truck pulls in. By then our timeline was messed up so we decided to pick up the next day with my dad's card on file.  We pick up the truck(which only had a quarter tank) return it no issues, with my card on file and on my receipt. Next day, I get the receipt for 140, less than what was quoted, great I thought! But there's no charge on my card, my dad got charged the original quoted price of 160. This location is full of inept people who aren't properly trained or care. Avoid this location.< /Text>

<review>So I was a bit skeptical to store my things at UHaul storage but so far I actually am very pleased. No hassling or un-easy feeling when sorting threw my things. Times are tough and they seem to understand that, as they are very understanding. Although the unit is a bit dark so I can you plan on spending some time going threw some of your things - make sure you have plenty of lanterns, lights, flash lights cause their hallway likes are motion detection and turn off if you are not moving up and down the hall.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Date>1526626372669< /Date>< Resp>

The people at this specific store are very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The storage space for U-boxes as well as the retail space are clean and adequate. The basic U-Haul equipment provided by them, including packing materials and vehicles, is satisfactory and nicely varied. But if you ever want to get them on the phone, forget it. The location on Santa Rosa Ave is also in a neighborhood where you have to be mindful of the possibility of theft, which complicates accessing anything in storage there. (Staff discourage you from leaving anything in your car, and are rightfully disinclined to leave U-boxes out in the yard for easier access. .. and since you can't reach them by phone to negotiate timing, it's complicated.)

But most of all, if I could give negative stars for the customer service provided by U-Haul as a company, I would. If you're looking for a moving solution, save yourself a whole slew of headaches, hassle, and misinformation, and go elsewhere.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

If I could give this company less that one star I would. We went numerous times during a two month period buying boxes and other packing supplies. So I had numerous receipts. When we went to return some unused boxes right before our move we were told that they could not take the return before “something else on the receipt had been returned”. What?? The woman couldn’t have cared less about this. After 2 hours on the phone, being shuffled from one person to another with corporate Uhaul we were issued a refund.
Go to HOME DEPOT, STAPLES, WALMART or anywhere else for packing supplies. We wouldn’t give Uhaul another cent. Also we used PENSKE for our truck rental because the prices were much much better.< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I reserved a furniture dolly with the truck and when I got there they didn't have it. Didn't even apologized. And then they gave me a truck that didn't have AC working, knowing that I had a 10 hour drive trip in the middle of summer temperature of 100 degrees. Then the truck lost power and I didn't even make it all the way to my destination!!! Oh, it also had a nail on the tire before leaving the UHAUL (this is the one on Santa Rosa Avenue, Santa Rosa CA). Instead of having somebody come out and fix the tire, they made me drive to the tire shop. And giving me a different truck was not an option!!!</text>< pictures>

<Text>These people are the sweetest! Although I spent an hour waiting in line, it was because of the attendants patience and service with this older couple who literally had a question about EVERYTHING. And though the line continued to grow, they were very conscious of it as well as the couple. The gentlemen never displayed that all the questions and all the time the couple were taking up, was as frustrating for them as it was for the line.<//Text><rate>5</rate></record>

Used U-Haul to get a ubox and fill it /ship it. Very friendly and efficient. Hooked us up and unhooked in a jiffy.

We had a tow hitch installed on our Toyota Sienna. While doing the electrical connections, they remounted our tail-light incorrectly and broke the bracket.

We rented a small sport trailer for a trip to Yellowstone. Upon picking the trailer up, we complained about the bald tires. Bald as in no tread whatsoever. Jim Coffee said he'd feel comfortable driving from Northern California to Texas on those tires.

Now, my family and I are stranded 60 miles from the nearest town in the middle of Nevada on the side of Interstate 80 with semis passing at high speed. The tires didn't even make it 300 miles. Jim Coffee put my family in danger and I will never use U-Haul again.< /review>

<Text>My husband called a week in advance to reserve a storage unit and we were told that our name was on the reservation. After a nightmare 500-mile drive in a broken Uhaul truck, my husband was told that although they had his reservation, they had no storage unit for us. They accused us of making the reservation online (because that's a great way to alienate your customers) and that's why it didn't work. My husband let the representative know that it was her, the very same clerk, that he had spoken to on the phone, as he remembered her name and they way she continually called him "sweetie." We are not your sweetie, we had a reservation with you, and we had a truck full of all our personal belongings that we then had to scramble and find other arrangements for. I will never rent from Uhaul again.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

U Haul.  If it can go wrong it will.  It's not personal, its just pretty common. No one can solve the problem because its never any ones fault.  Local or National it's always someone else.  Main thing for me THIS TIME was I ordered $500 worth of boxes on line, got my confirmation, followed up by an "its ready to pick up"confirmation email.  I went to the the Santa Rosa store and...they sold them to someone else.  None of the other stores had boxes either.  Boxes!?  Why would they sell my boxes I already paid for?
This meant on moving day (not a day you like to get surprises from u haul or anyone else on)  I got to do down to the FedEx place (rather then working on moving) and pay emergency rates for boxes so I could move.  Thanks a bunch for leaving me high and dry, cost me extra money, and making a traditionally stressful day even more unpleasant.   Oh, and good luck posting a review online on their website.  I have my contract number but that didn't work to post my experience.  If that is a regular practice I imagine their review ratings are quite inflated.  Very disappointed.< /text>

A busy small location that in my experience was ok until I returned the trailer I rented and was told by one of their yard guys to leave it in the spot he said to leave it in .  Three days later I was called  and asked when I was bringing it back.  I left my tie downs in the trailer the day before and had gone back the next day to get them and it was back in its original rental spot but still got the call 3 days later I hadn't returned it. Not sure what the check in and out process is here but sounds like it could use a little double checking in.< /Review>

<Text>I ordered a 20' foot truck 1 month in advance. They called 2 days before pickup to say that they didn't have any more 20' trucks. Ok, fine. I asked what they have that's comparable. They told me they had a 15' truck and will add on a 6' x 12' trailer for the same price. That'll work. I show up at the uhaul store to pick up. There is one person behind the counter, and 5-6 peopke in the yard working on trucks. The woman at the counter asks for my info, which I give, and she immediately goes to help the next customer in line without doing anything for me. She comes back after about 10 minutes of helping another customer, calls me by the wrong name, and proceeds to tell me that they don't have a truck or trailer available for me. I ask how this can happen and she responds: "we overbooked". Note that they have at least 5 15' trucks and several trailers in the yard. Absolutely ridiculous. No attempt to correct the 2 mistakes they've made. I ended up having to drive to Windsor to get a truck and larkfield to get a trailer. Will never use this company again.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Despicable customer service at this location. If people weren't forced to move and rent equipment, this business would be defunct. I spent over $1,000 on truck rentals for a huge move and they still treated me like dirt. Shameful.<//Text>

<Review>Since 19 80something North Beach Pizza has been serving pizzas to SF. They are also known as the one of founders of Pizza business at San Francisco North Beach neighborhood. I love older established restaurants and this is one I definitely loved..

I came here to meet with a friend and we had a couple of slices. So on we decided to take a seat outside to try something else, I had an incredible gnocchi. My slice was a simple pizza but the taste was so spot-on what pizza should taste like. I had a Margherita and the simple toppings of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil were fresh and perfect!

This is definitely place I would love to return to and try out their different toppings. So delicious!!

Thank you all North Beach Pizza front liners for all your incredible service and charisma< /Review>< Name>

Best thing in the bag was the Darigold butter, fettuccine noodles were already gummy like they were in the container for awhile. The Alfredo sauce was so runny with no flavor.  The spaghetti was the same.  I ordered a six pack of coke and it was $15.00 just for the soda. $2.50 per can. Bread was so crumbly it fell apart trying to butter it. The salad was good, but no where's near enough dressing.  Would not ever recommend this place to anyone. What a shame.<//text><resp>None<//resp><name>Wilbur or Veronica Dulany<//name><Date>1613096173102<//Date></record>

Heard about this popular local North Beach Pizza spot on Grant St, so I decided we all go there. The owners Nelo and Inessa where super welcoming and recommended the Coite tower pizza... Amaizing, the north beach pizza... Wowzers, the chicken fettucinni alfredo.... OMG and the lasagna Bolognese....where is the nearest 24 Fitness. Oh man did we all enjoy this place and their food. Very clean inside and outside. Great owners who care about quality food and service. If I could give them 10 stars I would. We will definitely be coming back here multiple times.

<Text>Spent nearly $40.00 for a pizza last night that was all around very bad. The dough tasted cheap, the toppings where all over the place and very unevenly placed (ex. I order feta cheese on my pizza and don’t even taste it.), and the pizza wasn’t cut correctly. I could have bought 10 oven bake pizza’s at the price of each slice of the large pizza I got here. Highly don’t recommend this establishment until they step their game up. Huge waste of money.</Text><rate>1</rate>< UserId.>

I've tried to like this place many times. It's close, It's on Grant, been there for years.They consistently fail.  I ordered the combination, medium. Ate a slice and ended throwing most of it away because it was not worth the effort to put the pizza together. It looked like half of the toppings slid off the pizza because it was bunched up in the box. Pizza was a tragic mess.The sausage was not entirely cooked and the dough was almost cooked.  Spent almost $40 bucks on something I had a slice of and threw out. Please, please, please,  step it up. You have a prime location and competition, and many other things going for you.  I dislike writing reviews. This experience irked me enough to write a review.</Text>

Not only was it fast but soooooo fresh. The price is a little steep compared to your average pizza joint you might visit in Oakland but given the area it's very reasonable! Soda is served in a can like most SF places. The staff is very friendly and quick to make you happy with any request. The ambiance is also very calming with soft lighting and excellent decor through out the whole restaurant!

If I could give them an extra star I would!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This pizza was atrocious. An oily, soggy mess with the cheese looking like Gerber baby food throw up. We ate about 30% of it before giving up and ordering from another spot.

I implore you to go once they open up walk ins. I don't recommend ordering delivery.< /Text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

<text>I used to be a regular here when I lived in North Beach. 20 years later, they're still doing it right! Pizza, pasta, wine - they've got it all and it's all good. And it's not quite as crowded as some of the more touristy places down the block.< /text><UserId.>110522205768460260582<//UserId.><Gmap_id>0x808581e6356ec229:0xedb7f6242ac4a25b<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
this lovely restaurant was absolutely the best breakfast i’ve ever had in palm springs! Everything was incredibly delicious. we ordered the Ham Croissant, Brie Omelet, french toast (caramel sauce one was SO good, it was soft and buttery and perfectly sweet) Literally every dish was so delicious we even came back the next day again!! wow and the service is phenomenal! coffee delicious, everything was so good. Sun roasted tomatoes on the salad was *chefs kiss* delicious.
this has definitely become my favorite breakfast spot in palm springs & I’ve been coming here for years. will definitely be our regular spot from now on!!</Review>

<text>The best food I had during my Palm Springs visit. Got the smoked salmon croissant benedict, coffee, and an *amazing* peach tart. All made with care and excellent ingredients. Such an incredible contrast from the overpriced/mediocre food all over the place. I'll be back again before I go!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLehTsRqLxyhzhTw66LpqjCwCzBO0QQg4sHg3-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlrliODYOnWiY8J3jWSYP0GecbQwIdWY0-bALP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

To me, it's the obvious choice for brunch or lunch in PS. Croissants, perfect eggs, espresso, sparkling wine+ fresh juices at exceptional prices.

<Review>This place used to be really good with fair prices and great service...

New owners,  absolutely horrible service, and ridiculous prices.  As an example, they charged $1.75 for jam for our croissant.   Nearly $6.00 for a small cup of hot chocolate.

Eat here, if you must, but expect horrible service and absolutely absurd pricing policies...

So disappointing...😔< /Review>< Resp>

To-go: Tried a coffee and a croissant. The inside of the place really gives out a true French vibe. The croissant was soft and crispy (but I'd be surprised if it was made on the premises).</Text>

We had a delicious breakfast this morning! Great French food with delicious bread! The eggs were great as well! Best of all was the great service! The kitchen consisted entirely out of French people en the French owner was a really kind and social woman. We'll definitely visit this place every day while we're in Palm Springs!<//Review>

Great little place for lunch. We stopped in on a trip through Palm Springs. Service was fast, the food is well priced considering the portions (both our sandwiches were too big to finish), and they were both delicious. I recommend ordering a croissant for an appetizer or desert. Look forward to coming back sometime.<//text>

< Review>
My family and I were having lunch at this restaurant a week ago. There were friendly waiters in this restaurant and the service was very fast. When cooking your food in a clear bottle, you can also see their chef. I guess it was the best, because you can see how your food is cooked and how clean the food station is. It was a very fun location!< /Review>

I had to try this well rated Palm Springs local French Cafe and I'm glad I did.
The waiter was fantastic. Get there early.< /Text>

French toast 😋
Make sure to get it with the caramel sauce instead of Nutella.</text>

We had brunch on President's Day at L'Atelier Cafe and really enjoyed it. I found them on Yelp and they were very highly rated as well as reasonably priced. They are a true French cafe, since the decor is French ("decor" being a French word), the ambiance is French (did you catch that "ambiance" is also a French word?), the menu was written in French and English (did you notice that "menu" is originally a French word?), the food was French, and the owners spoke French among themselves and to some of the customers.  I felt like I was in a cafe in the French countryside.

We ordered a couple of vegetarian croissants, each filled with 3 scrambled eggs, spinach, Gruyere cheese (French) and tomatoes. They came with a very high quality side salad, lightly dressed with a vinaigrette (French word!). They were truly delicious. They had simplicity, depth of flavor and that authenticity you will not find at a non-French cafe.

This cafe servers breakfast and lunch. Some other menu options include, quiche (French word!), omelette (French word!), sandwiches, including Jambon de Paris (I had to look that one up--it's a French style ham!),
Chicken, and Prosciutto. They also have crepes and, of course, French toast. Whew! We made it!

In short, I highly recommend you pay a visit to this cafe, as it is truly an experience beyond the food.<//review>

<review>Doesn't get any better than this place. Been coming here for the past year or two with friends and they're always consistent. I'd say this place is on-par if not better than Howlin' Ray's, at least with the wait time that is.

Chicken is perfectly fried, seasoned, and has just enough crispiness. I always get Combo #1 and order an extra tender medium spice level (if you get lucky they sometimes surprise you with an extra tender ;D). The fries and sauce is also amazing and it's more food than you can finish. Not to mention, only this location offers a free side (get mac n cheese!) with Yelp check-in, and I'm happy they continue to offer this deal.

The only thing I'd change about this place is their cleanliness, sometimes there are napkins and trash lying around the floor..but with everything else being so good, who cares.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Christina Black</name><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

<text>Amazing French-inspired café! We enjoyed the food and the service so much that we went back three days in a row for breakfast! After trying a few things on the menu, our favorite breakfast was the Workshop Eggs: scrambled eggs with Parisian ham, and the fresh and flaky croissants.

Jose is efficient, friendly and handled the current Palm Springs/California COVID relations in stride. We felt safe, cared for and valued on every visit.  Thank you Jose and L'Atelier Café for enriching our Palm Springs visit!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80db1ba433f8ed57:0x931b3d254028293b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful food, the atmosphere was steeped in French culture.  I had the croque madame and an espresso for breakfast. Absolutely incredible!
The best espresso I've ever consumed. I highly recommend this place if you're ever in Palm Springs.< /review>

Not to mention, only this location offers a free side (get mac n cheese!) with Yelp check-in, and I'm happy they continue to offer this deal.

The only thing I'd change about this place is their cleanliness, sometimes there are napkins and trash lying around the floor..but with everything else being so good, who cares.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80db1ba433f8ed57:0x931b3d254028293b< /gmapID></record>

<response>None</response><Text>Amazing French-inspired café! We enjoyed the food and the service so much that we went back three days in a row for breakfast! After trying a few things on the menu, our favorite breakfast was the Workshop Eggs: scrambled eggs with Parisian ham, and the fresh and flaky croissants.

Jose is efficient, friendly and handled the current Palm Springs/California COVID relations in stride. We felt safe, cared for and valued on every visit.  Thank you Jose and L'Atelier Café for enriching our Palm Springs visit!<//Text><Name>Janet Horton</Name><date>1612749969908</date><userid>106076682392687517599< /userid></record>

Excellent food, they help you find what kids want and kids loved their food.

We ordered side eggs, for kids and they were cooked great and with nice herbs, which kids liked.

My vegetarian omlette was not dry and had a good portion.

The only negative thing I can think of was coffee. It was tasting alright but too light for my taste.<//review>

Great place for treating Sunday brunch cravings. Cute little neat French cafe that offers ample sweet and savory pallet needs with quick service. We ordered croissant egg Benedict, scrambled eggs and caramel French toast - hard to choose my favorite among that. Would definitely dine here again and recommend trying if you are in the area.</Text>

Came in here while hitting the shops and it is the nicest little French bakery Cafe in Palm Springs. The owner was so nice and friendly. The macaroons are amazing. I loved the coffee one, probably my favorite. I tried their beer and cider. They are both bottled so nothing exciting there except the great price.< /Text>

Unfortunately this cafe has changed ownership. While the food is still yummy at best, it is not what it once was. The menu was a bit confusing with portion options that somewhat mock the American sense portion control. And sadly, I could not get the delicate lavender macaroon that was once offered here. 2 stars from 5 -<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxTrdnsa75262B9Z-6HvGOZTdx6BxUBhLeAVk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

Excellent french place!!! The croissant are the real deal, you can't escape them. Either order them alongside some baguette with jam and butter (french version of peanut butter and jelly), or just alone, they are a treat. I tried the double decker croque-madame, pretty solid. The owners are very welcoming :)< /text>

<Text>Absolutely love it. We've been looking for a great French option, & now we found it, without having to fly to France

Well, we are back. No reason to visit Palm Springs without grabbing an amazing bite here.

They import their butter and flour from France and it shows. The Croissant is so DAM flakey it will be messy but worth any amount of mess. Stunning

Today got the French toast with bacon (with fruit) & Parrie Omlet.
Owned by couple from France and she takes your order, she's losing her accent (compared to last year).
With the croissant you get butter (yummy butter) & jelly, make sure you try it all 4 ways (Plain, butter, jelly, butter & jelly) before you judge the right way.

Essentially you can tell, we absolutely love this place, sit outside and enjoy the shade & breeze with the best French food outside of France.

We added an irde if fries with blue cheese, exquisite. Just enough blue cheese to add flavor without drowning them in cheese.

Try them too.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Great place for treating Sunday brunch cravings. Cute little neat French cafe that offers ample sweet and savory pallet needs with quick service. We ordered croissant egg Benedict, scrambled eggs and caramel French toast - hard to choose my favorite among that. Would definitely dine here again and recommend trying if you are in the area.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGKbDqDX7pgXbo2Y9d9kKgphf8UQJgfLN-FjLL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

Excellent food, they help you find what kids want and kids loved their food.

We ordered side eggs, for kids and they were cooked great and with nice herbs, which kids liked.

My vegetarian omlette was not dry and had a good portion.

The only negative thing I can think of was coffee. It was tasting alright but too light for my taste.< /text>

The place, service and ambiance is really good. However, the cappuccino is not well done, its presentation and taste its simply bad. Toast French are good, not spectacular but pretty decent.< /Review>

Having worked at a traditional French Cafe for several years my bar is fairly high for this type of cuisine and L'Atelier delivers down to the last detail. Friendly and quick service with a smile, an authentic menu and eclectic space. You can be further from France in Palm Springs but this place could easily fool you as long as you sat inside. The food was amazing, while I ordered breakfast I may have to come back to try their lunch offerings as well. A true 5⭐.</text>

Can't miss the French flag hanging in front. Comfortable, small, and welcoming. Only tried the macarons (good) and the French mimosa (freshly squeezed). Pricing is more than fair.</Text>

Good presentation of dishes, beverage, very clean flatware (that should/does matter!), pretty good French roast coffee.  The waiter was very good, had good humor.  Reason it doesn't get "stellar" rating is that delivery did not meet expectations:  fruit salad was ruined by pieces of melon so old that they were on their way to liquefaction (I fished out the edible pineapple pieces and the merely two fresh strawberry halves).  And the croque monsieur:  melted cheese was fine, but the bread was anything but French, looked like barely done Texas toast out of a supermarket bag, and the ham, too, out of a supermarket lunch package.  That said, I would come back to try out a pastry at least, and re-order the coffee.</text>

A lively little French cafe with an enticing menu. My ham and cheese crepe came with a small salad and was delicious. The side of fruit was a lovely assortment and very fresh.</Text>

L’Atelier it’s my new favorite breakfast spot. Inside the restaurant itself it’s small but cozy and decorated with all sorts of fun French Decour. The owner Angelique and Alexandra are so warm and welcoming. The food is delicious and very well priced! Definitely recommend<//Review>

Service is amazing. You really feel like you're in a cute little French bistro here. I've almost tried everything on the menu and everything here is delicious. I found out it changed owners several months ago and I'm happy they kept the spirit of the original L'Atelier.<//Review>

< Review>
The food is wonderful and the owners  even sweeter! I had the pleasure of sampling two different kinds of quiche, mushroom and another kind of vegetable perhaps zucchini and ricotta cheese. I’m not sure what the ingredients were but it was like no other quiche I have ever eaten before. Not only did it taste good but it was very moist and still had a crispy crust. I don’t know how they do it! Also, I sampled the fruit tarts and the French macaroons. They are to die for! Don’t hesitate to eat here.</Review>

<Text>New ownership it looks like. Menu, decor, food and staff are all completely different. We had two prosciutto sandwiches since we remember them so fondly. They were bland and nothing like before. The waitress, who looked like the owner, never came to ask us if we were okay, for more water or anything, but attended to everyone else just fine. I had to flag her down to get the check and a box. A shame what happened to this place.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1574096831620, 'text': 'Dear Albert Macias,\nI am the owner of this place and I was not your waitress on this Saturday like you said!\nWe work so hard to make this place the most comfortable and efficient as possible!\nThis is strange because we took over one year ago, previous owners didn’t have this sandwich, so you probably got this one with us... fresh mozzarella is always bland maybe you didn’t have enough pesto sauce this time !!\nI think it’s really not fair the way you judged us!\nYes, little by little we change the decor, our customers and we prefer it like that!!\nRed and green make us happier than grey! How can you judge that?\nYes, we change the menu one year ago because now almost everything is “homemade “! Previous owner didn’t have the “prosciutto sandwich” so I don’t really understand!\nAbout the other ingredients:\nAs soon as we don’t have bread or croissants we bake some all day long...\nAbout our waitress: she is a very hard worker, and very nice, we really like to work with her! sometimes it happens that we don’t have enough time to go back 2 times at the tables, I am sure she did the best! Do you know how hard is it to stay all day long standing on your feet? Have you ever missed something when you worked ?\nI can see on your account you gave a lot of bad reviews on others restaurants, so maybe you can give the chef some advices the way to cook and teach the waitress the way to be more efficient! It will be a pleasure to have you and make some other improvements!😀'}<//resp>

Bad service. Even from the very beginning, when we wanted to order croissant, she asked us which one in a way that made us feel quite uncomfortable. At least I'm sure anyone from an American, Taiwanese, or Korean cultural background would find it impatient and rude.

After that it was a lot of negligence. When we try to catch her eye or say excuse me to ask or order something, she just wouldn't see. I went to the counter to grab our water because I was too thirsty to wait.

The rest of the staff seemed pretty friendly. It is unfortunate that our waitress, who was a lady with short hair and a tattoo 自由 on her back, was not.

We are giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the croissant was quite good. Terrible latte though.</text>

Truly a Wonderful Experience, and how often can you truly say that about a restaurant.   I  had the pleasure of dining in this gem twice last week.  The quality of the food is exceptional as was the service.  They make everything fresh from scratch and were very accommodating to my dietary needs.  If in Palm Springs, this is the place for breakfast and brunch.  I hope they open for dinner soon.  I will be back and will recommend this spot to all my friends travelling to Palm Springs.<//Review>

Cute environment with robust offerings. Nothing lacks taste and flavor for this bistro.

The quiches are the best i have ever had. The cheese and charcuterie are straightforward and delicious. The sandwiches are crunchy. The service lacks a bit due to being quite busy. But they try to meet every need.<//Text>

Fantastic, fresh, simple french food. The owners are a wonderful couple. Their employees are exceptionally attentive and polite. Every single person I have ever brought here insists on coming back, 3,4,5, ...10 times during their stay. The food is not only fresh and superbly prepared, the presentation is gorgeous and very charming. Their coffee is the best I have had in Palm Springs ,including authentic cappuccino. The prices are very fair. This is a favorite spot among locals. If you have to wait a bit, do so! La Plaza is very sweet, so your 10-15 minute wait will be spent looking at beautiful things all around you. You will always be treated very well at L'Atelier.<//review>

<user_name>Darren B (Two Twenytwo)</user_name><Date>1547407945243< /Date><rate>4< /rate><Text>This was my first time here, and the food was delicious -- the reason for giving 4 stars.  As for service, I would like to visit again and at a different time before making judgment. I obviously visited at a very busy time and our server seemed very rushed and preoccupied. Each time she visited our table, she walked away before we had a chance to complete our requests -- sometimes when we were in mid-sentence.  I'll visit again when it is less busy -- if there is such a time. If not, then service needs to improve before I can give 5 stars. But by all means, this place is worth a visit.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My wife and I had an amazing quiche here this past weekend. The ingredients were fresh, and the flaky crust was made to perfection. The chocolate mousse and espresso rounded out the perfect lunch. We had never visited here under the previous ownership, but having visited Angie and Christopher's cafe in Biarritz, L'Atelier is bound to only get better and better.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This. Place. Is. AMAZING! I wish I could give it 6 stars. My wife and I enjoyed brunch - I had an omelette with wild mushrooms, spinach, potatoes and goat cheese. She had one if the specials and it was heavenly. Perfect portions, just make sure to add a croissant on the side.< /Review>

Best food of our trip! I had the egg, gruyere, bacon croissant sandwich and it was amazing!! The eggs were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The croissant was so good that we got a few to go. It was breakfast, but the food was so fantastic that we got a dessert too. If we come to Palm Springs again we are getting breakfast there every day. And, I'll probably have to try their lunch too. Don't hesitate, just go enjoy the deliciousness<//Review>

The food was good, but service was well below par, meaning inattentive/ uninterested. It's a tiny place with very little seating. There are a few tables out front in the walkway. The pastries looked delicious.<//Text>

This little french cafe has delicious breakfast and lunch. It reminds me of Paris. The buttery, fresh croissants along with the lattes and $5 mimosas keep us coming back. They also have delicious mini crepes and macaroons.</review>

If you never had a REAL FRENCH CROISSANT this is the place to visit!
Had the Veggie Croissant and it was perfect!!!The French lady (owner?) told me they make the croissant themselves in the shop. Great job! Warm, crunchy outside, soft buttery taste inside. Stuffed with 1 scrambled egg, cheese, spinach, avocado and tomato. A perfect start into the day.
Double shot Americano came in a porcelain cup with just the right  will of water to maintain an intense espresso taste.
I'll be back here again. The sooner the better ...</review>

Absolutely delicious! Prices are reasonable, and the food is really outstanding. They have actual nice coffee too (I'm from Melbourne, Australia, so it's refreshing to have actual coffee in America). Staff are lovely! If I lived in Palm Springs, I'd probably make this my regular breakfast hangout.< /text>

I thought I was going to have to wait a long time to get my food, but they were actually quick and the food and service were really good. If you like scrambled egg croissants with the exact amount of French cheese, look no further. Only mild negative was that it got a little warm inside.</Text>

<review>Made from scratch authentic delicious French breakfast and lunch/brunch. As a culinary trained person myself I have utmost appreciation for the talent and hard work that goes into scratch cuisine. It's a rare find nowadays. The raspberry jam is house made and incredibly tasty on the perfectly balanced savory, crunchy outside, chewy inside croissants. The macaroons are perfect, and the pistachio is my favorite.< /review><GmapID>0x80db1ba433f8ed57:0x931b3d254028293b< /GmapID><username>Roaxana Poskey</username><Time>1488135690391<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< UserId.>

My wife and I have been to Palm Springs the past couple of years and "discovered" L'Atelier and make a point to always stop by for lunch.  The food is always fresh, simple, delicious and authentically French (never-mind the surrounding businesses).  If you are fortunate enough to experience the chocolate mousse special, do not pass it up!  The recipe has been handed down through Charlotte's family and it is by far the best mousse I've ever had - by far.<//review>

The recipe has been handed down through Charlotte's family and it is by far the best mousse I've ever had - by far.</text>< gmapID>

<Text>This was my favorite meal in Palm Springs. I can't wait to go back and try something else. The owners are all on the property and they are all working HARD. The interior is French, retro, charming and chic. The food was OUTSTANDING.

PROS: Pate sandwich
French press coffee
Croissant breakfast sandwich
Fruit side dish

A food review:

Chocolate croissant was light and buttery with just enough chocolate to sweeten each bite.

Croque monsieur is a traditional French ham and cheese sandwich. Sturdy but soft pieces of bread cover simple pieces of unsalted ham adorned with melted cheese and white sauce. At this place, the gruyere cheese and bechamel sauce might tempt you back for more.

Was told that the bread is made in house except for the macarons.

Food came quickly-- service is friendly and leisurely.< /review>

Super quaint french place, reasonably priced, perfect for bkfst/brunch.  Croissants and baguettes were amazing.  All fresh squeezed juices.  The sweetest staff.  Get there early to avoid lines, we came in just before 9am and within 15minutes they had a wait but I can see why, so worth it.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>My husband and I were in the area for the weekend and were looking for brunch. We decided to give L’Atelier a try and I’m so glad we did. The whole experience was fantastic. The location is convenient, right in DT Palm Springs, they have a couple of tables outside with a refreshing mist to keep you cool in the desert. The French waitress was super friendly and professional, visibly happy to work at this restaurant which is always a good sign. And the food... oh boy it was good. My husband had the Esther Mixed Platter which was gigantic and tasty and I had the Veggie Croissant which was simple but yummy and exactly what I was looking for. Prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is very nice. We took a Pain au Chocolat to go as well and I had it when I got home and it was delicious, just like in France. Bravo to the team and merci!<//Text></record>

Excellent French toast with delicious salted caramel and exquisite peach tart. If you want to have a taste of French savoir-faire, don't hesitate to go there, you will not be disappointed! Merci encore pour ce petit déjeunez qui me rappelle mon enfance.</Review>

Extremely rude French Woman who I assume owns the restaurant.. when asked to leave something off my order she was clearly inconvenienced and demanded I choose something else however could not recommend anything.  Food wasn’t anything special for our breakfast and when it came to paying our bill, the tip we left mustn’t have been satisfactory to this Woman as she felt it necessary to state “service isn’t included”.. I did give a couple more dollars and informed her she was an extremely rude woman! Will not be back!<//review>

The chocolate croissant sent me to my happy place! I also loved the quiche Lorraine,  creamiest eggs, and wonderful flavors.  Arrive early,  this place is so good they get a line of people waiting to eat here. Small, delightful, wonderful service.<//Text>

Charlotte is the most awesome restauranteaur! So sweet and hard working. BUT you are going for hand made French food and pastries. Everything is so fresh and yummy</text>

<Review>An instant hit. My wife and I fell in love with this place from our first visit. We go as frequently as we can, and this place has yet to disappoint. The atmosphere is straight out of France, with the french decor and music playing in the background. And the food! Real authentic french food (owners are from France) that is delicious! Eggs Benedict, omelettes, quiche, macaroons, this place has it and every dish is unique. A definite must!<//Review>< gmapID>

Very good food. Exotic. Different and well done. I'm impressed. I'd give it a go if you are in for some quality french breakfast and gourmet coffee in a comfortable small setting.< /Text>

L'Atelier Benedict is a definite go to, go for the croissant base. You'll love it. My friends loved their dishes and I honestly left in a better mood. I just left and I already miss the taste of the Benedict!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>The atelier cafe is a great cozy place, very good for eating fast or enjoying peacefully. Possibility to take away, handy if you're in a hurry. The dishes are served quickly, generous like the Americans do, and bringing the French know-how. The manager, always smiling, supported by his team will take care of you and your expectations for you to spend the most pleasant moments.
I chose the croque madame, often too disgusting or too heavy in some restaurant, I highly recommend it. Impressive but very light, an excellent béchamel with a salad and a touch of pepper sauce on the side to give a little "peps" to the dish.
To finish a generous strawberry tart pastry cream and strawberries excellent with a slight acidity so that it is not too sweet.
Like the Americans says ... AMAZING

L'atelier café est un endroit super cosy, très bien pour manger rapidement ou profiter tranquillement. Possibilité de take away, Bien pratique si vous êtes pressé. Les plats sont servis rapidement, généreux à l'américaine, en apportant le savoir faire francais.  La gérante, toujours le sourire aux lèvres, épaulée de son équipe seront s'occuper de vous et de vos attentes pour que vous passiez le plus agréable des moments.
J'ai choisi le croque madame, souvent trop écœurant ou trop lourd dans certains restaurant, je vous le recommande grandement. Impressionnant mais très léger, une béchamel excellente avec une salade super et la petite touche de sauce aux poivrons sur le côté pour donner un peu de peps au plat.
Pour finir une tarte aux fraises généreuse en crème pâtissière et fraises excellente avec une légère acidité pour que ce ne soit pas trop sucré.

Great food, horrible service. Not worth going back because of the bad service. Long wait to get our food. Our toasted Baggett was cold. The butter and jam that came with it was hardly enough to cover the two slices. Very limited seating. And to top it off, we discovered that we got some else's check after we had already paid! We went there twice because the food was so good. The second time the service was so bad that we will not go back.</review>

< review>
I had lived in Paris many year ago and wherever I go away from home I try to find an "authentique" French Cafe.
L'atelier Cafe is the Place. They have amazing croissant sandwiches, quiches and delicious cappuccino. Their food is always fresh and they offer a very friendly service. They are also dog friendly. It is like to have a little of Paris in the middle of the Desert. Voila, I found my place.< /review>

The staff is super friendly in this small, quaint French café. The case of treats looked deliciously divine so we bought a lemon tart! Our brunch was absolutely delicious and we cant wait to make a stop here before we leave town. I highly recommend the Croque de Madame and make it a triple, you wont be dissapointed!<//Text>

Simply the best quiche and other french foods.  Charlotte and her husband and staff serve marvelous food at reasonable prices, with a cute bistro-style sit-down environment where you can take your time and thoroughly enjoy a meal, a glass of wine, dessert or all of the above.</Text>

Small and quaint; however no restroom to wash hands, etc. They suggested using the hotel across the street on Indian Canyon Drive not all that close when you're ready to eat.   Sandwich dry, omelette was unappealing .  Staff was friendly.< /Review>

<review>Authentic French cuisine! The owner Charlotte was friendly. Quaint little bistro with DELICIOUS pastries and dishes! I had the jambon, caramelized onions and egg croissant and it was amazing. My cafe au lait was delicious and tall, which was appreciated. The  baguette was crusty and made for a great crunchy bite with the raspberry jam and soft butter. Also had a bite of the French toast with the homemade caramel syrup. OMG! Perfect bite. I will definitely be coming back again before I leave Palm Springs to try the quiche and sandwiches. Kudos to the owners. Je t'adore L'Atelier!< /review>< Rating>

Nice little café centrally located. Nice French atmosphere, outdoor tables, everything appears authentic. The cappuccino was really a latte,  all milk and coffee. The omelette was well done on the outside, but the egg inside was raw. The fruit looked good but the bananas were spoiled. The "fresh" Orange juice was not! In fact at the end of the glass it tasted horrible.  I tried to order as my experiences in France, Belgium and The Netherlands were but the cook refused to make my Sandwich without the sauce she declared was necessary. Mustard on a breakfast Sandwich just doesn't appeal to me.</review>

<review>Very cute, cozy French bistro by authentic French owners. It is centrally, and at the same time, beautifully located at the walkable plaza in the heart of Palm Springs. I had the Petite Quiche Provencale that stands out with its goat cheese and combination of fine herbs. It was delicious. I added the L’atelier French pastries a mix of small pastries of butter croissant, chocolate croissant, and raisin roll. Great price $1.90, but know that they are really small if you have a bigger appetite for something sweet get a regular pastry. On the other hand, great for tasting from everything. The pastries are fluffy and buttery with its authentic croissant crisp. And of course, I had a café latte which tasted smooth like European coffee. The couple that runs the café is French and very nice. The only downfall is that it is so popular, but small, that it can be crowded and you have to wait in line for a while especially on the weekend.</review>< user_id>

Very cute, cozy French bistro by authentic French owners. It is centrally, and at the same time, beautifully located at the walkable plaza in the heart of Palm Springs. I had the Petite Quiche Provencale that stands out with its goat cheese and combination of fine herbs. It was delicious. I added the L’atelier French pastries a mix of small pastries of butter croissant, chocolate croissant, and raisin roll. Great price $1.90, but know that they are really small if you have a bigger appetite for something sweet get a regular pastry. On the other hand, great for tasting from everything. The pastries are fluffy and buttery with its authentic croissant crisp. And of course, I had a café latte which tasted smooth like European coffee. The couple that runs the café is French and very nice. The only downfall is that it is so popular, but small, that it can be crowded and you have to wait in line for a while especially on the weekend.<//Text>

<Time>1399917008547</Time><Text>Discovered this hidden gem on our recent trip to Palm Springs. Attentive and extremely friendly service and wonderful French food (easily some of the best we have had since our trip to Paris a few years ago). My wife and I LOVED everything we had - coffee, croque madame, macaroons (my wife thought they were better than the ones she had at Ladurée).

If you are ever in Palm Springs go eat at L'Atelier. It is well worth your time and money; my only regret is that we didn't find this place sooner.< /Text><resp>None< /resp><name>Mike B</name>< Pics>

< review>
We've been so lucky to find this little cafe. We have been welcomed by the owners, a young french couple who came to palm springs to bring a little piece of paris in the desert. We tried different dishes and everything was delicious, tasty and well presented.
We shared the cheese platter and it was amazing. Charlotte explained us how to eat it, from the mildest to the strongest and which cheese were on the platter and their origines. I really recommend the Saucisson sandwich with a side of soup (i had the carrot, goat cheese and coconut soup...very creative and so delicious). My husband tried the Smocked Duck salad and he loved it. He also tried a side of their house made fries. They serve the fries with a HM aioli which was also amazing. To finish with, we got an amazing latte and shared the raspberry tart which was scrumptious. All in all, we really recommend this place which serves excellent quality of food in a very cute decor with an amazing service. Thank you Charlotte & Raphael<//review>

<text>WOWWWW, what a great find! While visiting Palm Springs we stopped by L'atelier cafe and really LOVED our experience there. Everything we ordered was tasty, flavorful...DELICIOUS.
We ordered the french scrambled eggs (moist and fluffy) based on three eggs scrambled with french ham (they really import the ham from france...I couldn't believe it till I tasted it), tomatoes and gruyere cheese. The eggs melted in my mouth.
We also get the eggs benedict. Hands down to the best hollandaise sauce I've ever had. So tasty full of fresh lemon and very buttery. YUMMMM.
We also tried a couple of pastries that just came out from the oven. OMG, the croissant and chocolate croissant were to die for. To finish we tried the opera cake which was amazing and my wife had a dessert made of lemon mousse and butter cookie which was also very good.
A special thank you to all the team, you all made us feel special for our anniversary.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Awesome veggie omelette croissant and very reasonably priced (specially compared to the other breakfast spots around).

No restroom, keep that in mind.</Text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>This café makes wonderful coffee.  Unfortunately, the praises stop there.  It's idea of a Croque Madame is one in which the bread is an odd, non-toasted, whole-wheat, seeded sandwich loaf.  The bechamel was barely present; the egg atop the croque concoction overcooked; and the presence of Dijon mustard in the recipe was anything but subtle.  I ordered a Croque Madame and got a ham & cheese sandwich wearing a fried-egg beret.     My side order of french fries was also an underachiever.  The fries were undercooked, almost soggy, and were heavily coated with some sort of cajun-style seasoning.  The date cake, which apparently is the recipe of the owner's mother, was drier than the 12% humidity that existed in Palm Springs on the day I ate at the café.  I suspect the cake, if properly stored and eaten within a reasonable time after being baked, would be quite tasty.

Service was attentive and genial, but, given the prices charged, the café needs to rethink some of its "C" offerings: Croques and cakes.  Its other "C" item, coffee, was delicious.<//Text><Date>1442729926823< /Date>< Name>

Drove specially for breakfast from Indian Wells. Was well worth it, a small local cafe with a real French touch.</text>

They will make you wait for 2 hours  after waiting 1 hour to get a table, Food tastes like rotten old egg omelet  and the cups and cutlery smells bad , with stains.Avoid this place at any cost.< /review>

A demanding Parisian word!
