<review>Bought a rear axle off a low mileage truck in mid November. Oddly enough it only lasted 10 weeks, even though original lasted 200K. First thing they asked is when I bought it. When they found out it was still under warranty for 2 weeks they tried to convince me it was my transmission not working. The next guy I talked to on phone claimed I may have used the wrong gear oil. I did not. He also suggested I add limited slip additive and give it a couple weeks, just enough time to run warranty out. Of course I told them I wanted a refund, but when they found out I didn't have original receipt they said I couldn't take it back to them, even though I knew what vehicle and what date I purchased and had record of it on my card. Also they didn't have the returns with  receipt only policy posted anywhere in their business. Don't waste your money here, there are reputable national dismantlers that stand by their products.
PS
After Subways response I feel it is important to clarify. They did not offer to look at the part, I did not agree to take it in. They told me they wouldn't refund or exchange without a receipt. Obviously they can look up the purchase as they have stated in their response. But they choose to not stand by their warranty instead. You're reviews on good parts mean little. How you handle a warranty says alot about you.< /review>< pics>

{'time': 1579278377086, 'text': 'Mr Ruiz:  our 4 1/2 stars from nearly 100 other reviews state otherwise. In addition, your review is factually inaccurate. After research, it was discovered that you purchased this item on 10/16/19, not mid-November. This equates to 30-days of our clearly stated 90-day warranty. Item #1 on our receipt clearly states: "1.  This  receipt must accompany all claims and returns."  Additionally, during your conversations with our staff, you once mentioned the the replacement differential was doing the same thing as your prior differential. Also, with limited slip differentials, it is imperative that the proper fluids and additives are used, which we were attempting to verify. And the last conversation was for you to remove your differential to bring in for evaluation, which you failed to do. Your warranty was in effect until 1/16/2020 (after the date of your negative review), but you chose not to cooperate within your warranty period.'}< /Resp>

I purchased a 2006 6.0 powerstroke engine from subway on 6/25/19. Had the engine resealed as stated for warranty purposes. The engine was professionally installed at a reputable shop in Roseville ca. I have since put 1771 miles on the truck since I got it back. It’s been having some drivability issues so I had it inspected thinking it was something minor. Upon inspection it was found that a lifter has come apart causing it to eat away the camshaft. I spent 3697$ on this engine that has only lasted 1771 miles. They basically told me sorry about your luck and thanks for your money on the phone today. I would recommend not buying anything from these guys. I wasn’t even asking for a full refund. Possibly just an exchange or something even though I have over 7k$ worth of receipts for parts and installation besides the initial cost of this junk engine. It still runs fine at this time once warmed up but the oil system if full of material from the camshaft. Once again I would not do business with these guys at all. What a huge waste of money.</Text>

I investigated your review and determined that my sales person, who may have been grumpy for the moment, handled the pricing of your requested part properly. You were in need of a 20-plus year old plain steel wheel. One that is a bit odd and difficult to find. Our had a little surface rust. Which is common with steel wheels. Our $60 price, which we offered to you at $50, was the lowest price in greater Sacramento per our parts locator, with the next lowest price nearby being $100. We have since sold those wheels. We try to make every sale we can without "giving away the farm."  Sorry it did not work out on this one.'}</Response>

The trucks posted online could be long gone.
Phone calls seem to take priority over walk ins.  I've been there twice and had to wait minutes to check in.

I was looking all over for a 2008 Dodge dually long bed in white. Subway had one and they sent pictures of it to my email for me to look it over. I liked it and wanted it so I called them back and we talked. I was going out of the country in a day so I offered to send them 1000$ Non refundable to hold it for me until my return. They agreed and I gave them my cc #. I called them on my return and I arranged a time to get the bed and they suggested that for an additional 100$ they would remove my bed and replace it with their bed and do it all right there while I waited. I worried how I would do what they offered to do in my yard and without a crane and decided for 100$ to let them do the swap. Best $ I ever spent. Once there I also found a rear bumper for the same truck and bought it also. They installed it too. What nice folks. Since then, I have continued to call them for other parts and also for a 12 inch x 12 inch bed floor to patch a hole in another bed that I have. They always seem to come through even with odd or strange requests. I will go nowhere else but to Subway for future parts needs. Thank you Tony for your help and look forward to future purchases with Subway. If only all businesses could be so good to work with!<//Text>

Better than Pick n Pull. The guys here really know what they are talking about. And if they dont have what you need, they are sure to help you find it or find somewhere that will have what you need. Or even give you a few other options to check even if it isn't through them. They are always helpful, nice, and straight foward!< /review>

<Text>Found some hard to find lock cylinders for a Chevrolet Avalanche at a great price after Dave returned a email with 5 minutes of my request. Fast, efficient and easy people to talk to. I'm sure they will be shipped to Minnesota in the same manner as above! Added info 03-20-2016 : parts showed up better than described, fast even to MN and best of all no surprises or issues.... Thanks again Dave

I used an internet search to find seats for my '06 Tundra.  Subway had a good pair at a fair price.  I ordered and about 7 days later they arrived at my home in Corpus Christi.  I couldn't be more pleased.  The seats were in the condition described (good)  and they were nicely mounted and shipped and arrived in good condition. I wouldn't hesitate to use Subway again.  Thanks guys!</text>

<review>DISHONEST THIEVES THIEVES THIEVES!!! So I called Subway Truck Parts for a Transit connect air cleaner box and talked to Brad, he said we have a complete air box. I go to pick it up, so while I was Robert brought out the air box complete. I also needed a fender that they had so me and Robert went to the yard to see the condition of the fender and when we got back in to the front desk, I see the air box is missing the air flow sensor with the torx screws left half way screwed in and I see the sensor with the same stock number as on the air box I just bought on the desk behind Dave (sales person) so I ask him "isn't this supposed to be complete with the sensor?" He says "No we sell them separately" I ask "isn't that one from my air box?" He insists "NO THEY LOOK JUST LIKE THAT" AND TURNED AROUND AND FLIPPED THE SENSOR OVER SO YOU CAN'T SEE THE SAME STOCK NUMBER AND SAID "WE HAVE ONE IF YOU NEED IT"
DEFINITELY WILL NOT TAKE MY BUSINESS BACK TO THEM!!!!!<//review><Gmap_id>0x809ad748071e20af:0xce5cffcf4a3f4178< /Gmap_id>< UserId.>

<text>My names Carlos and I live in Illinois. After searching all the local yards here for a Cadillac Escalade roof rack all the yards were asking for way to much very expensive. I came across Subway Truck Parts online and they shipped me the Cadillac Escalade roof rack for WAY LESS than anywhere else. Final price was cheaper than anywhere else. I emailed with the owner (Brad) he always emailed back promptly. Very very helpful after all was said and done I received my part in 1 week and I am very satisfied. Will do business again price was so low I thought it was an error. Around here they want 300+ I paid less than half that. Thank you guys</text>< rating>

After waiting for the party on the other end to check availability, he came back on the line and said they had it.  He asked me if I had $10, and when I told him yes, he said to come and pick it up.  I told him I would be there after lunch.  I arrived at the store at about !:30PM and told the person at the counter what I was looking for and he had to check stock, and ended up going out to the lot to get one. When it came time to pay, he requested $50, and I told him what had transpired with my phone call about the price, and he said they never sell them that cheap and wouldn't honor the price quoted on the phone.  I didn't have the name of the person that I spoke with (my bad), and no one in the place would say that they had spoken with me, so I left and won't return, and will tell all of my friends about the incident.

After looking around in Rancho Cordova dismantler for a specific a/c control unit and having no luck, I came across Subway Truck Parts online. I called and they had the part I needed at a really good price. Every time I order from them, they always have the best deals. I will definitely contact them when I need parts.</Review>

My son's thin crust pizza.. Minimal sauce, edges burnt. However, the Manager was nice and is having it remade.< /Text>

<review>I rarely leave a comment on Google but I need to share my experience today. The driver (which I will not name- He just need coaching on his service and prayerfully will change) but he left my order on the ground- never knocked on the door to let us know he was there. I had my son open the garage to meet the driver - but by the time he looked out - the car took off. My son came back in the house, opened the front door and found our food on the cement.
I gave everything a 5 star except the deliver. An hour later - GM Michele leaves a vm that she refunded my order. I'm beyond words- honestly that was not my intention- I just wanted someone to talk to the driver and let him know that wasn't right. Thank you Michelle for going the extra mile to elevate the  customer's experience.< /review>< Pictures>

Ordered on line - waited a few minutes and drove over to the restaurant.  Got a text telling me is was in the oven and would be ready in 8 to 10 minutes.  Waited about 5.  When I walked in they were actually cutting it up!  Delicious and prepared just the way I requested.< /text>

This place is horrible, over an hour for one sandwich. I’m sorry but that’s terrible. When you call the store the guy sounds like he’s been getting stoned all day and no clue what you’re talking about. My food still hasn’t shown up.

Update! Finally showed up, hour and 20 minutes. Driver forgot my drink and this is how well made the sandwich is. Terrible. And they wonder why they shouldn’t get paid more than 8 dollars an hour.<//review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>This domino's location is full of lazy employees. I've placed multiple online orders for curbside pickup and every time I sit in my car waiting for someone to bring my pizza out and nobody ever comes out. When I asked them why they didn't come out they say everytime they didn't know they had an order. Thats BS and they know it. I tried to show them my phone with proof and they don't want to see it. They need to hire better employees.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Dominos is awesome. I always order online and get delivery, and they are always fast and the food is always good. Keeps me happy in a time like this with covid and social distancing. I wouldn't order from anywhere else ☺️</Text><GmapID>0x80dc825fa059fe01:0x759447604d6db306<//GmapID>< Rating>

Usually they are ok at best. Don't believe rhe online tracker. Its fake. Said my food was already delivered and it was not. Waited another 40 min before it actually arrived 1.5hrs after I ordered. Manager would not talk to me and the kid who answered the phone did not seem to care.</text>

I ordered over phone. That was easy. Get to the place to do pick up, not so easy... They couldn't find my order in any way shape or form. They were busy.. Few minutes later they find my order. Yay. It took additional 15 20 minutes, and it tasted great. Little hiccup great taste!</Text>

<text>If I could give them no stars I would. The manager Michelle was rude and could careless that the dominos tracker said my order was ready when it hadn’t even started. She couldn’t even give me an ETA on when my order would be ready. Horrible horrible customer service! I had to call them three times because I was being accidentally hung up on

Ordered my pizza online, drove to the store when the app said it would be ready 45 minutes later.  When I got there the manager said I would need to wait an additional two hours because they were very busy.  When I complained about the additional wait, she asked for my order number and cancelled it.  Just like that, she got rid of me.  Soooo unprofessionall!!  Will never go back.</Review>< Pictures>

I meet with store associate that told me the order was not made and I would have to. No biggie. Waited 15min came back and again was told that the order was not made. I asked why and he said he didnt know even after I spoke to previous associate. I asked for a refund and the manager. The manager said she was never advised of the missing order and that there is a known issue with the mobile app. She went inside and gave me a refund.

Costumer service at this location is subpar to say the least.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Pictures>

She made my night so much better. Her guest service alone is magic, she knows how to handle customers and make people smile. I came in so upset over my ordeal with Pizza Hut, I wanted to cry! But she just calmly answered all my questions, kept my calm and got me a delicious pizza. Which is all I wanted! Her staff are fantastic. She clearly knows how to run a store and deserves a raise! She is a fantastic guest connections person. She should go train all the people all Pizza Hut.

This is by far the worst experience I’ve ever had.  The manager who took my order and my money told my order would we ready and delivered in 1 hr . 2 hrs later , no delivery. I cAll and she hangs up the phone on me multiple times , until it turned 12 am and the store closed. No phone call, no delivery and no refund . I will not stop until this women and sorry excuse for a manager is fired< /Text>

I would recommend using the Domino's pizza app if you get pizza regularly because  After 6 orders you get a free pizza.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc825fa059fe01:0x759447604d6db306<//gmap_id></record>

Always making excuses for being late. I worked Dominos in Upland and other stores for 6+ years and this store is not nearly as busy(200 pie hours) ...time to quit the excuses and step up.  Heard order taking talk at least 4 people out of ordering  by threatening an hour + for carry out....pitiful<//text>

<review>placed my order at 6:12 pm website stated my pizza would arrive in 63 minutes. I  called the store at 7 pm just to be told that I would not be delivered until 8  pm. The girl on the phone was not welcoming and gave no resolution to this problem. After I let her know that the website stated a different time. Not happy about the service at all....</review><gmapID>0x80dc825fa059fe01:0x759447604d6db306<//gmapID>< user_name>

Got a Text that the pizza delivery driver left over 30 minutes ago..., The online tracker says "Delivered"... I called the store, and was told "The tracker is ahead of what is really happening"...   I guess I must assume the text that I got stating "Your delivery driver, Alvin is on the way"", 40 minutes ago... is "Fake Information" as well....  And, pizza finally gets here, and it was certainly far from hot and fresh.<//Review>

I have used this Domino's repeatedly since I moved to the area 2 years ago. I have had nothing but great food delivered hot and fast. Every driver is polite, and every time I call the store I am spoken to cordially and respectfully, yet directly. Great job to everyone there.

Edit: I do not know what happened. Maybe a change in ownership, or management, or a general lack of apathy consumed  the entire crew. Perhaps it is a mixture of all three. Regardless, it is directly affecting the quality of the food in a negative manner. I have consistently received pizza, wings, and bread products that are haphazardly thrown together and produce a "Frankenstein's monster" of food. Please, for all that is Holy, exorcise whatever demons have taken hold of this location and return to the quality and freshness that made me a fan to begin with.< /text>

Online ordering process was easy and convenient. The delivery portion not so much. After 90 mins my order had not yet arrived. I finally called the store and spoke to a so called manager who said 90 min delivery times are normal (even though the store is only 1.3 miles away). Furthermore, the online order tracker said my order was "Out for Delivery" over 35 mins ago. The manager told me the online tracker is not even close to accurate and they don't follow what it says. He told me just to wait and my order (2 large pizzas) would be there shortly. After another 15 mins of waiting (almost 2 hours from time of order) my food had not arrived and I call back and canceled my order. Ten mins later the driver arrived at my house and I sent him back with the now cold pizza.

This was not the first time something like this has happened with this store. I have had nothing but great experiences with other stores in the past, but this store just can't seem to get it right. Avoid this store, use Papa John's, Bella's Pizza, Maxx Pizza, Jersey's Pizza, etc. as an alternative if you live in there area of this store.<//Review>

I placed my order on line.   While it was still baking on the Pizza Tracker, I headed over (5 minute drive) to pick up.  I was ready when I got there.   But, the pizza looked like it may had been dropped and was cold.  I asked for hearty marinara and I'm pretty sure I didn't get that.  I wondered if it was already prepared and they just gave me an extra they had.   Pretty sure that's my last time ordering from Domino's< /review>

We order from here all the time and we love it. Food is always great and they have amazing service.

And just a reminder to the silly haters on here, even if you had a bad experience this is a franchise so why would you recommend no one eat at any Domino's ever? Why not just voice your opinion and leave other people's businesses alone...< /Review>

<text>Terrible service. Called in order, arrived at scheduled time and they claimed they didn't have order in the system. They told me to wait and they would make it in 10 minutes, but 30 minutes later, no pizza. Took 45 minutes to get out of there. No apologies or consideration offered from the poorly trained, ill mannered staff. Will not return.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dc825fa059fe01:0x759447604d6db306</gmapID></record>

<review>0 stars if that was an option.
- I ordered a pizza through the domino’s app, was checking the tracker every couple minutes to see how my order was doing . When the pizza was ready to deliver it said that the driver left at 6:32 pm, the driver didnt show up to my apartment until 7:15pm when i payed him he constantly kept asking how much he owes me back like as if he was asking for the remaining $11.00 change as a tip. Even though he was 40 minutes late i left a $5.00 tip. So i open my box to begin serving my daughters, both my pizzas were soggy and cold. I called the store to complain and as i was explaining what happened to the guy over the phone he hung up on me mid sentence. I call back to see why he hung up and i heard him pick the phone up and slam it back down to hang up. So i call a third time and the manager working at the time answered the call. I asked her why I was hung up on and she was basically defending the guys actions stating it was on accident which that does not just happened ! They have absolutely horrible costumer service , i asked for my money back which she said she could not do just give me a $15 credit which at this point i wanted nothing to do with this dominos after the lack of costumer service they had ! i asked for the store manager name or number which she also refused to give me. I stated i wanted my full refund back and that i will drive down there myself and bring them back there pizza which i did! I will never order from this dominos again!<//review>< pictures>

I order 3 pizzas got 2 right 1 wrong. Called to have them fix the problem they wanted to charge me for delivery even though they had messed up. Went back to get my right order and came back home and the ingredients were raw. Called again asked for a manager a lady answered and we told her the ingredients were raw laughed and put us on hold. Then a gentleman answered by the name Justin and said he was the manager and said he had gave us a free pizza which he didn't. I then told him what had happened again and told him we spoke to a lady manager and said their was no lady manager. So now I don't know who the manager is because he wouldn't tell me. Been coming here for years had never had any problems before but now with this I'm done with Domino's. Thanks< /text>

Ordered online .  Dominos tracker came up..when it said it was ready I drove up. (5mins max.). Got here and cashier tells me it’s not ready give them 20 mins...I say tracker says it’s ready.   He tells me oh those trackers are never accurate...the manager says the tracker isn’t on us.. those things suck.    Awesome service dominos !<//Review>

When not busy they do well however with allot of activity they seem flustered and if you do not stay on them they lose track of what is happening. Also my tracker said I picked up the pizza but I was actually still waiting for it.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>They clearly dont care about their customer service. I have ordered from this store twice and both times my orders are incorrect. Today they crossed a line when my order was incorrect and I called them on it the "manager in charge " refused to give what was promised because of their mess up. I literally had an argument with them, they take no responsibility for them not doing their job correctly and they place the blame on the customer instead. Nothing but attitude was refused to be allowed to speak to a higher manager! If I could give them no stars I would you shouldnt have to argue with people for your order that they messed up and recieve attitude for them not doing their job right! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ATTITUDES!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

This has got to be the worst Dominos ive ever ordered from. 5 orders in a row messed up. Unknowledgeable staff. After working at another pizza chain this place cant edge lock a pizza to save their lives. Dont order from here.< /Review>

Domino's app said my order was ready at 5:04 p.m. I walk in at 5:30 p.m. they told me 5 minutes I wait 12 minutes then they tell me there was a mix-up and they're just putting my order in the oven. I got a refund and left. Will not order from this location again< /text>

Avoid all Raja Enterprise Domino's stores, they serve expired product (found many expired foods they've used before at one of their stores) and they treat their employees unfairly.</review>

This W.D. Office has made tremendous changes all for the better! OMG What a night & day difference this almost completely new staff & management has made.
The ladies are always friendly & helpful.
The wait time is very minimal now & tolerable. I used to have to wait over an hour at times when I had a scheduled appointment.
This is my fourth set of dentures in 2+ years as they haven’t been made correctly, too much gums, crooked teeth, gum color mismatched & they even lost a set of dentures that have never been located?
I highly recommend this store location as this team of workers know their stuff. I appreciate them for the hard work & professionalism that they now show. My complete turn around time from start of dentures to finish is approx a month & a half to two months without ANY problems. Come check them out!!<//text>

Hey no I went there just to get checked out because I hadn't been to the dentist in quite some time and I knew I needed to and these people need to be paid more money or have more people hired because the place was thriving with bodies and they moved them in and out just as fast as you can possibly do my waiting time was under 10 minutes and I was in the chair getting x-rays before it was all over I have been given a referral to an orthopedic to UCF and I'll be going back there as soon as they get that and the it was painless time at the dentist which I was in fear of I recommend it anyone that is afraid to go to the dentist or hasn't gone a long time call Western dental I can't vote for all of them but the one in Pittsburgh in on railroad is very professional thank you very much<//Review>

<text>My dental cleaning and XRay appt was very thorough and great care was taken to make sure I was informed at every step. That office has two really good x-ray technicians, very considerate dental assistants and the doctor gave me an excellent cleaning after going over a treatment plan.  I’m a happy patient at Western Dental in Pittsburg.</text>< pics>

I went to Dr. Yasaman Sani a few years ago. She suggested crown procedure on of my teeth. A few nights ago I noticed that the crown became dislodged and is floating around my mouth. I made an appointment to go and visit her to take care of the issue. Dr. Yasaman and her team were rude and unprofessional and wanted to charge me to
repair and fix the crown. This was not a pleasant experience.

A well-trained dentist team is critical to providing high quality care with desirable outcomes.

This is the worst experience I've had with dental.<//Text>

I hate western dental. I was making payments in store but the balance showed different when i talked to the customer service rep. They put me into collections and wouldnt let me set up a payment plan to see the dentist. I have braces stuck in my mouth and they wont work with me to fix it. Very rude staff and customer service.

I love coming to this office, from the lovely receptionist, Cynthia and Jade, to the doctor and everyone in between.  The office has a new office manager, Roya, and I'm happy with the change.
I've heard about other office and see how they don't have the best reviews, but this place is worth giving them a shot.

I've yet for them to be discouraging or negative in anyway. Brandi and Jade the young ladies in the front office are the sweetest I have met in a dental office to date. They understand people have lives and work schedules and they try to work around those to make things work. Also you will typically see the same dentist and assistants when you are seen on a regular basis, plus they take payments unlike private orthodontist who want the money upfront 90% of the time.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Having this wisdom tooth to be pulled had me stressed and under a lot of anxiety..
They kept telling me it would be fine and he was so good of a surgeon that I wouldn't even know he had pulled it...
Well once I was seated in the chair and he explained everything he was going to do he asked me if I was ready to proceed and I said okay let's just this done I didn't feel the needle when he numbed me and I close my eyes before he began the procedure the next thing I knew ...he said we're done!
She definitely is an amazing doctor stressed days for nothing LOL<//Text>< pictures>

I will update my review once I come for my appointment. The reason for these 3 starts so far is because I scheduled my appointment online on a Friday afternoon.. Tuesday came and I did not receive any sort of confirmation so I called to schedule it over the phone, all to be told I was already scheduled for so and so date. So like why not give me a call or shoot me an email to confirm? If I didn't call I would of have no idea they even received my request for an appointment. So if you schedule online make sure to give them a call to confirm when you are scheduled for!</review>

<Text>Normally I don’t like going to the dentist offices, but the receptionist Salvador was extremely nice and helpful. The manager broke down and explained everything I needed to get done and helped me set up a payment plan that wouldn’t break the bank , haha.
Dr. Nouri and Liz did an awesome job as well.
Thumbs up guys!!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>2 hour wait with appointment.  Had appointment for my inlaw on 9/2018 but wait time was 2 hours, had to leave before treatment because of prior arrangements.  Last visits were the same with long wait.  This clinic does not value your time, wants patient lined up so DDS will be working for maximum profit for business.  Owner is probably going to say I'm sorry I will make  better scheduling.  The fact is this clinic practice over scheduling in case anyone cancels or comes very late for appointment.  Sorry does not compensate for my loss of time.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1537297272368, 'text': 'Tommy, thank you for reaching out to us and bringing this to our attention.

I have been waiting for my grandson since his 10:00am appt. It is 3:00pm and they still haven't completed their work. This is a simple cleaning with his brace wire removed and replaced. This truly is no way to run a professional business.!!! I would give them negative stars if that was possible.</text>

Thanks to Roya for helping me figure out which treatments are more important and in which order I need to get everything done in. And then went above and beyond by helping me choose a payment plan that worked best for me.

Went in for a check up after some time for treatment today and as usual it was a wonderful experience thank you again to all the staff Dr. Mercado, Roya and the rest of the team</Text>

<text>Today was great. I got there and was seen an hour before my appt, mainly because the patient disk show but oh well. The specialist they had today was great. He was nice, gentle when needed. Hell I started falling asleep during the procedure...which I'd never do because I don't do dentists lol I can't remember his name but he was awesome. The staff there is very friendly. I love Roya, she's very nice and helpful. They All are really. Wednesday(8/7) the doc there wasn't (seeming) caring about the pain I was having. I still love it there tho, I plan to continue to see them after all my work is done (for check ups)< /text>< time>

< review>
I got braces here and it was great until I had to move states and to where I moved there wasn't any western dental near so I had to start all over again in a whole different office. So I did, I started all over again but the new office needed my history and I had to get it from western dental. I swear I called western dental about 3 times and all of the times they said they would send me it and they never did! This has been going on for 4 months. I haven't been able to continue with my treatment anywhere because western dental won't send my history. Everybody in my family uses western dental and it has gone good for all of us. Except once my brother had some dental work to do and they gave him numbing shots and they didn't do it correctly which caused him to get swollen lips and it lasted 2 weeks. Otherwise totally recommend this office. Totally affordable!< /review>

<review>This is definitely not the place to go. I had an appointment for my 2 children on a Friday at 330pm for fillings and a cleaning and they had us waiting for 3 hours and no work was done and they had to reschedule us for the following Monday. We get here today only to still be waiting for the dr to begin the work. Appointments was for 10am and I was told they would be the first which was a lie. 12pm comes around and they are still sitting in the back waiting. I don’t have time to be taking off work for all this waiting. It makes no sense. I will not be bringing my children back at all.</review><Rating>1< /Rating>< name>

< Review>
It was terrible the dentist did not like me asking questions and some of the replies from non dentists were "it is bad to numb both sides of the mouth" and "its a general  anesthetic" what does that mean? The dentist gave me some answers. Then when I ask the dentist for a list of other dentists that I could see, the dentists leaves and sends someone to tell me that the dentist doesn't feel comfortable enough to do dentistry on me. There seemed to be district feeling of intimidation in the non dentist facility as if the dentist could fire anyone who did not maintain a professional attitude in the work environment arbitrary to the dentist sentiment. It also seem that some of the dentists enjoyed having power of over some of the staff to where the staff seem to be in a state of implicit servitude. In an early visit the teeth cleaning seemed to be rushed it was rather displeasing.<//Review>

<review>This place doesn’t even deserve one star in my opinion. I went there for the first time just for a check up and they don’t allow parents in the back with their child. When I went, they started to take out my fillings and put in new ones without my moms permission. And I have something wrong with my jaw which causes me to not be able to open it very wide and they forcefully opened it which was very painful. After leaving I was in so much pain and was crying and even in the lobby the other kids were crying as well. This place truly is the worst I’ve been to and I wouldn’t recommend it AT ALL. I would give them negative stars to be honest. I never wrote a review but I just want to warn others.</review><resp>{'time': 1546642349562, 'text': 'Mehikk please provide further details to review at customerservice@westerndental.com'}<//resp><Rating>1</Rating>< Time>

<rating>1</rating><review>Worst dentist ever! Do not take your children here! The x-ray technician who x-rayed my child was very in-experienced! She did not know how to phograph my child's teeth correctly. The x-rays was not coming out accurately, which caused her to make numerous amounts of extra radiation exposure to my child. She was even pointing the x-ray machine to my child's eyes. Smh
The next day my 7 year old little girl woke up with a black eye. And she asked me why was her eye black. I told her I think that it had to be from that technician pointing that xray machine at her eye.
I knew it looked wrong, and I should have said something; because, it just do not seem that the x-ray machine should be pointed towards someone's eye socket to get an x-ray of their teeth!
This place is just horrible!
They are so lazy also! They want you to make numerous appointments for treatment.
My child has an emergency loose tooth that won't come out and needs to be pulled, and it's pushing her new tooth outward.
I don't even know if it's infected, but they refused to see my child for her first appointment, they only wanted to give her an x-ray. They could have atleast given her an antibiotic prescription just in case if she does have an infected tooth, since they refused to see her at her first appointment. They told me that we will have to make a seperate appointment to come back...another one for an exam, and then, another one for the tooth extraction. This dental office and the Western Dental in Antioch needs to be closed down for malpractice, children neglect, children patient rejection, and for delaying emergency medical treatments.</review><Response>{'time': 1551993047602, 'text': 'Greek Thalassa, we are very sorry to hear about your experience and we want to be sure that we address this issue for you.

Expect a long wait just to be helped, you can have an appointment and wait up to 1hr+ to be helped. Besides that it’s not too bad just a really long wait time.</review>

never gonna go back . they were EXTREMELY unprofessional and didn’t know what they were doing . took 2 hours to get my xrays and after numbing my mouth, i waited hour and a half to finally get my fillings so i felt EVERYTHING . while they were cleaning my teeth tho, the lady made ME hold their tools (the suction thing and the one that sprays water) like ?? and while i was getting my fillings the doctor kept dropping her tools on my face . i also have a really small mouth and they just kept yanking at it and trying to get me to open it bigger . by the time i left my entire jaw was sore, my face was extremely irritated and i just began crying, felt like i wasn’t being cared for AT ALL . they literally only want ur money smh< /Text>

Horrible service,worst than a used car salesman,Unprofessional,Bullies in the office.Nobody knows a thing ,once you are a patient, you cannot go to any other Western Dental,you are stuck within the confines of the Pittsburg office.They have a new office manager who is really great, because she is so professional,she went last long, There are a bunch of wolves waiting to eat her up.A good person won't last long there.Horrible contracts,even the dentist are rough and careless,they make mockery over your dental conditions.Horrible very emotional a d mental a stressful.</Text>

This place is one of the worst!! Its the second time, I bring my children here and I have to sit here for literally two hours before my children are called in. One of the instances the receptionist were talking about abortions and sex out in the open. They have to professionalism or have any clue what they are doing. The staff is horrible and clearly dont care about their patients.< /Review>

<Text>Terrible. I can't speak to the actual dental service as I've yet to actually get back to see the dentist. This is my second time coming here for my daughter. The first time we had an appointment for 12 p.m. and after 2 hrs. of waiting, we still hadn't been seen so we left. We got another appointment for 9 a.m. a week later. Showed up when they opened. We are here right now. It's been an hour. Several people who came in after us have already been taken back and yet we wait. This is ridiculous. Their scheduling is awful and they must not have enough dentists to take care of the patients. People are rude or anything...just slow and uninformative.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I wish I could rate this no stars because it is that bad. Every single time I come here, I have an appointment scheduled and I still have to wait 45+ minutes to go back to the dentist chair. Once I get to the dentist chair, it literally takes at least another 15 minutes before someone even comes back to talk to me. I got locked into a stupid braces contract and they tell me I can't leave to another western dental because the payments are going to this one. Do not come here. I am a very patient person and these people really want to test other's patience. Like seriously, I need some kind of accommodation after having to come here so many times.<//review>< pics>

<date>1464902191502<//date><Rate>1</Rate><review>I arrived at 9am for my 9:45 appointment because I am a new patient here. The front workers were completely confused by the paper work and kept asking me to explain my allergies in front of everyone in the waiting room. Xrays took over and hour because the tech who did them the first time was new and did not do them clear enough. So they all had to be re-taken. Then I waited in the exam room for an hour to be seen by the dentist. An hour! Laying down with no one around. There are plenty of employees (I can tell because they have loud personal conversations) but no one alerted the dentist that I had been laying down for an hour to be seen. This is a simple teeth cleaning. The total appointment shouldn't have taken much more than an hour. But it took 3 hours! From 9am to 12! I am never coming here again.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>If I could give 0 stars I would. This is the most unprofessional, nonclient orientated, and waste of time ever. Instead of a western dental just call it "make an appointment, come wait 4hrs, be seen for 30sec. And tell you to come back next week dental" they always seem to lose your customer file so every time you go in they can't do any work cause they want new xrays which is a damn scam to get money from you and your insurance company. So you having to wait 4hrs to be seen is a complete waste of time when they tell you set a new appointment and come back next week so we can charge you more money again. They should give you a damn Nobel peace prize if you keep your calm in this place with kids running around, laughing employee's, old sticky magazines, uncomfortable seating, and constant wait times. My children literally waited 5hrs to be seen for damn xrays. Then we go back for a routing check up a couple months later and guess what...another 4hr wait and more xrays and NEVER GET WORKED on by the denitst. I pay of pocket and drive further out to Brentwood and go to gentle dental just to not deal with sheer BS of this establishment. May as well have their slogan "Western Dental, competing the DMV wait times since forever. Now give us your money and get out"<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Luckily for me this time it was less than 30 mins and it was when they first opened. The ladies up front were very nice and informative with everyone checking in. The lady in the back taking xrays was great, super nice and the dental assistant was very good on checking up with me before and after my appointment with information on permanent whitening even though its a little to pricey for me right now they gave me ALL the info I needed. The lady at the front desk even showed me her own pictures of her teeth which I loved. I was only there for a cleaning and 3 fills but they were fast and I didn't feel a thing after then numbed my mouth. Over all very pleased with this experience even with my insurance covering it.

These people are straight up criminals. White collar crime of the worst kind. I could go into great length but just look at other reviews. Besides their lack of professionalism (making appointments and not keeping them) they run an insurance and billing scam that is either intentionally dishonest or just a product of complete incompetence. Either way I call that criminal!</review>

This is the worst place ever. I got some filing services only one time, paid for the services in cash the portion after insurance, yet they decided to run my credit without my authorization. When I disputed the credit inquiry through lifelock, they claimed to lifelock that they have a signed application from me. When I went to the office, they said they never ran my credit and I'm still trying to get that inquiry removed. On top of that, western dental keeps sending me letters that I owe more money to them when I paid exactly what they said it would cost on same day I got the service. Can't find one person who can give me a straight answer..<//Review>

They are SO unprofessional as nobody knows anything and my Daughterhad been being bullied not to mention her own insecurities due to her teeth and Western Dental were supposed to have had her braces on September2016, but they supposedly couldn't find anything about it. So therefore another casting aka impressions of her teeth. That makes it twice. I call and get the run around so I decided to go to Antioch Ortho and the Dr there took 2 impressions aka castings and I was CALLED in 2 weeks or less to be informed that she's beenshe's been APPROVED SINCE AUGUST2016!!! YET I COULDN'T GET HER TREATMENT ANYWHERE BUT PITTSBURG OFFICE. During this time MY Daughter was bullied cyber bullied and tried to END HER OWN LIFE! Lawsuit here Straight up unprofessional unorganized and careless.</text>

Do not go here. this place is the worst dentist i been to in my life. They repeatedly schedule appointments and dont put them in to the computer, did it twice to me then said they couldnt see me dispite the fact i had paperwork showing they booked a apt. At the third visit i was finally seen but had to wait three hours first before even getting put in the room to wait for the exam. Avoid this place at all cost.< /review>

Worst experience. Wish google had negative rating..

Never take a kid to this dental clinic EVER.. Will make you wait for ever. I took my 2+ year kid to this center for the first visit and here is my experience.

1. This was my son's first visit, so had to fill some details initially.
2. We were asked to wait for 1.5 hours, and the receptionist said the doctor who looks after kids is busy. In the mean time 10+ adults have gone for checkup and were out.
3. I asked them to cancel my appointment as i had only half day permission from work. Immediately the doctor was available and was taken in for a checkup.
4. After we went in, the doctor said my kid was not co-operative and was asked to go to a dental center in Concord where its kids friendly. I lost 2 hours for nothing. No transparency from the staffs too.

This is one of my worst experience in the last several years.<//Review>

My Daughter has been waitingfor her bracessince last summer 2016. They never called me back and when I called, I had to go back in and get another casting done. Once again NO RESPONSE! I call WESTERN Dental AGAIN on RAILROAD IN PITTSBURG, they tell me I will have to do another casting. That would be the33rd time. So, I go to Antioch Western Dental and within2-3 weeks I get a call to schedule for her Braces but I have to do it in the Pittsburg Facility as MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN APPROVED SINCE AUGUST 2016!!!! I can't get no one to answer the phone and how is it that the PITTSBURG OFFICE NEVER KNEW YET THAT MEANS THE 1ST TIME CASTING WAS APPROVED AND NO REASONHER BRACES SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON SEPTEMBER 2016.MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN THROUGH HELL DUE TO BULLYING AND HARASSMENT OF HER TEETH. SHE TRIED TAKING HER OWN LIFE BECAUSE OF THE DRAMA AND TRAUMATIC INCIDENCES. LAWSUIT? SHE NOW NEEDS INPATIENT TREATMENT. I'M SO DISGUSTED WITH THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND PROFESSIONALISM THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NON EXISTENT!</Text>

<review>Worst most terrible place to be seen by a Dentist, the waiting is horrible!! If you’re going to be seen in the Pittsburg, CA location, plan to spend the whole day waiting! You might want to cancel any plan you have for that day because you will end up at that location all day. I took my daughter there for 6 months clean up at 3pm, we waited three and a half hours went by they finally looked at her teeth, they immediately sent her back out saying we have to reschedule because they won’t have enough time to work on her teeth that day, including no cleaning! If I had any other choice for Dental work I will never come back to this place again!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The night before their visits I received a voicemail to call them. I called back 2 mins later and nobody responded. I showed up for the scheduled appt and was told by the RUDE rreceptionst that they would only see 2 of my 4 children.  I agreed to reschedule the other 2. I waited for over 2 hrs and all that was done was x rays. I have an 11 month old a 3 yr old and a 4 hr old that were getting tired and restless.  I ended up walking out without the other 2 kids getting their teeth cleaned. I will not return here again. I work healthcare and can not believe the unprofessionalism and disregatd of the staff.  Why make an appt when you need to wait for so long? I would have thought that if they know how many patients are coming in ( the reason for scheduling an appt) that they would have adequate staff to sservice  them.  This was the worst experience I have ever had with a dentist office.</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Before we started orhtodonture for my autistic son, I was assured their orthodontists were capable.  In the meantime, it's been a nightmare.  My son has to wait for hours in a crowded room, which is a HUGE# challenge.  The orthodonture hasn't gone anywhere because they have problems treating my son.  I've tried to call his primary orthodontist, Dr. Bailey, who is good, I think, but she hasn't responded and isn't available at times my son is.

Another orthodontist bait and switched  me to take a plan that was more than TWICE as much as the original I was quoted.by Dr. Bailey  (This is the railroad office., PItttsburg)

I didn't get proper disclosures and I'm an attorney.  We are getting OUT of this place.  Lawsuit to follow.

Have your legal counsel contact me.

<review>(Translated by Google) My dad is the person who has had the appointments with them and one of the things I don't like about this place is that they give you your appointment time but they have always taken more than an hour and a half to attend it. I understand that sometimes they may have complications with other patients and for that reason your appointment takes longer but I do not think that every appointment that he has had is the reason for the delay. This place needs to have more communication with their patients and let them know if they are behind and for how long they think it can take to see you. Other things that I don't like is that if you call them on the phone they answer you and put you on hold for almost an hour to answer your call.

(Original)
Mi papá es la persona que a tenido las citas con ellos y una de las cosas que no me gusta de este lugar es que te dan tu horario de cita pero siempre se an tomado más de una hora y media para que lo atiendan. Yo entiendo que en ocasiones puedan tener complicaciones con otros pacientes y por ese motivo se tome más tiempo tu cita pero no creo que cada cita que el a tenido esta sea la razón de la tardanza. Este lugar necesita tener más comunicación con sus pacientes y darles a saber si están atrasados y por cuanto tiempo crean que se pueda tomar para que te atiendan. Otras de las cosas que no me gusta es que si les llamas por teléfono te contesten y te pongan en espera por casi una hora para que atiendan tu llamada.</review><UserId.>116077477476411908076</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80855bfb35874667:0x3abd42c4e56442d</gmap_id>< Pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a very bad clinic ... they grab my turkeys when they want and every time they want I spend 2 years with my wife pay and now sign for someone else and the same thing happens they are very rare ... my wife was first covered the teeth and 2 months later they wanted to take them out because I didn't need them after I paid them 1000 dollars and I really don't recommend them ...

< Review>
AMAZING!  I ordered the Basil Chicken Wings and Sweet Potato Fries.  Feels like I was falling in love.  I also love their Lemon Grass Chicken Sandwich, not a fan that it is now mandatory as a combo with chips and a smoothie, however, today they informed me you can exchange the chips for salad and you can get soda instead of the tea/smoothie, I'm excited to order it again next time!</Review>

My husband and I wanted to try something new but were in the mood for garlic noodles. Found this spot on Yelp.

I got the premium bbq combo with garlic noodles and a fried egg. It came in a cute disposable bento box with pickled and steamed veggies. With a slice of pineapple delicious. Everything had great flavor and very filling.
My husband got the chili shrimp and spicy garlic noodles which were also great. We also order the super fruit organic jasmine drink and the organic mango smoothie pearl which this one reminded me of boba but with jellies instead of tapioca balls.

Overall was a great first impression and we will be coming back.</Text>

<text>A welcome higher end Pho restaurant in the Dublin area. Clean and modern. Upscale utensils and presentation. Good quality. The main area for improvement is in the temperature of the broth. The bowl is the same for regular or large. After mixing, the food is not warm enough, especially for the large order. Basil chicken also not hot off the fryer.<//text><Name>Stephen Lee<//Name>< UserId.>

New place, opened 2 weeks back. Very good service. We ordered the pop corn chicken (little salty. If you like it salty, you can try it out). Main course was pork chops and lemongrass chicken. Both were very good. We were given fresh home made sauces which was also good. For the drinks, we ordered the mango n Creme brûlée’s and both were good. Definitely try this place out.< /Text>

<text>Various options in here, from Pho to rice. it's close to Outlets, about 10 mins drive. If you would like to have a noodle soup after shopping, this is the place you could go to. Inside is very cute and cozy, but seats are limited.</text>< name>

<review>For me to give 5 stars everything has to be perfect. The food here was really good. Had the popcorn chicken, spicy beef pho, and the tofu rice with egg on top. The drink was tasty as well. Got the ocean. It is very cramped in there...maybe 8" between tables. Not a big space. Would recommend for sure. Take out would be pho king amazing. Lol.  Check me on twitch hugh_ginvaney. Enjoy!</review>< pics>

I came here today, their decoration is very special with milk tea and pho. I like their pho the most with the special broth. The broth is different the other Vietnamese restaurants, and I talked to the owner, he said the broth is cooked with their special recipe. They are close to the shopping plaza, it is good for a rest after a crazy shopping!< /text>

Service is great, very clean environment, many selections on the menu, Vietnamese based foods and they added some fusion taste, the tomato crab noodles give another level of taste 😝 yummy

<review>Really enjoyed their rice dish with the basil pork and fried egg. Also comes with a salad and egg roll.  All of their homemade dressings/sauces were yummy.
We also got their beef pho combo and chicken pho.  Beef broth was good but the chicken broth wasn’t very strong - odd that it had broccoli in it too.
Popcorn chicken was in thin strips - different that what we are normally used to.
Overall very pleased with our quick dinner and service was friendly.  Will definitely return!< /review>< response>

<review>Reviewing the garlic noodle dish, this place has unique sauces, very tender chicken and has a heavy garlic aroma from the noodles. Including  a salad and imperial roll makes this a balanced meal. If the noodles are more al dente the rating will definitely be higher.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Really like this place. It’s a bit like French style Vietnam. The food selection is simple yet look yummy. Their service is nice and accommodating. We had seafood pho, Basil Lime Wings, and Laksa noodle. All are tasty, not overly. Definitely will come back to try other dishes.</Text>

Food is good. But the service is bad. After getting our entrees they get the water. Water is halfway filled. Food takes really long to be cooked.<//Text>

<Review>Pho and Thai Tea was good. Unfortunately I only tasted the pho that my girlfriend ordered and I ordered a Bahn Mi and Wings. It turned out to be a reasonably tasty Bahn Mi, but should not be delivered as it was incredibly soggy by the time it arrived. The basil wings were undercooked and flavorless and I only ate two before throwing them out. I am writing this review at 5 am after 2 hours of stomach pain/vomiting which whether it was the wings or not they are certainly a likely culprit.<//Review>< pictures>

Food was great, had a ton of flavor. Portions were overly generous. I'm a big dude with a large appetite, was full halfway through my meal. Ordered vermicelli with lemon grass chicken. Came with a jalepeno chutneys, fish sauce, and a salad dressing. All house made with great flavor. The real draw though is I'm a milk tea addict. I got the Ancient Black Fresh Milk Tea. This is some of the best boba tea I've had, maybe the best. I'm not a boba person, usually omit it, just do straight tea brown sugar, or crema. Not with this tea. The boba is stupid fresh with the perfect chewiness to it.  Can't wait to try them again. And yes I would totally stop by just for tea alone. Food is just a bonus to me.</Text>

< Review>
Randomly found this pho place close to liver mall. I ordered a regular size of pho and surprisingly, the amount of beef is quite a lot. For expensive place like Dublin, I don't think you can pay $11 for such size of pho. And taste was above average. They also have some fancy boba teas too but I didn't  get the chance to try. Definitely will go again next time after shopping from livermall.</Review>

<Review>Great family park for parties or play days.  Several picnic areas, playground and ballfield. Outdoor half court basketball is unmarked and rough asphalt.  Poles are installed for grass volleyball, bring your own net.  Lots of space to run, play and explore.  My kids enjoy climbing trees, summiting the dirt mounds, and trying to get across to the "island" that is created by seasonal flows in the drainage ditch.  Rent the hall for meetings, events or indoor volleyball or half court basketball (court is narrow.)<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Date>1485476362492< /Date><rate>5<//rate><Text>A large and never-crowded park (due to its location a little west of town) that has gotten some additions recently. A new restroom, large grills, picnic tables, and playground equipment. There's a baseball/soccer field with bleachers and an event building that's available for rent. It also has the "giant golfball" as locals call it, a huge weather station, as well as a volunteer fire department. It's peaceful and quiet and you're sure to spot a big group of grazing deer. It's always clean and it's a great little spot.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt-qfGVJTcu1mYaz0BU2DHHNVhVf7KuFPUEJGe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ8RyhV6dPN1xNJIeuuRFo_1zjUiEsI7leEdQR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN5ONSfSH8e1TrtqlkoXEmPVWGbDs-Zx8COgnd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSxqIn0KZ6ipC2Mz4k0Vnz7JtdHCIeAIcpMbg1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

Such a wonderful place. The park grounds have everything you need. The indoor recreation center was perfect for our wedding . The caretaker of the property is one of the nicest men you'll  ever meet.<//text>

< Review>
I went in there to have my Metro PCS line transferred back over to Verizon because that is what I’ve always used and the young lady that helped us not only ported my number back over but she also hooked up my husband to have his phone line on too. She was very helpful and extremely knowledgeable about her job.<//Review>

Excellent service and not pushy at all. She helped us get new phones and didn’t force us into buying any accessories we didn’t need. Very helpful getting phone numbers switched over. 10/10 service<//Review>

Up-selling an old couple as i sat there for an hour because the person helping me told me it would be easy to transfer my service without knowing how the system worked.
Don't go here, take the drive to Redding.
Edit: You don't get to copy paste an apology for years of doing this to people.< /review>

Jade and everyone at Verizon in Anderson did everything they could to get us a good deal on a new smart phone for my husband. She took the time to show us all of the important things on the phone and even put on the safety shield and cover. Great group of young people and super service!!< /text>

<Text>I waited an hour in the store before either of the two people working even acknowledged me. Apparently they were too busy ordering pizza with another customer. (Totally professional, guys.) Another hour after that, they finally started to "help" me. By "help" I mean they told me they didn't have what I wanted.<//Text>< rating>

<review>Went in because my iPhone was having issues. During my time there they were fairly helpful about the SIM card issue but informed  me that I was on an older plan and if I upgraded to a newer plan it would save me $27 a month overall. Turns out that was a complete lie and my next bill was $120 more due to plan change fees and my monthly bill was projected at nearly $70 more a month. Guess it was my own fault for not asking to see anyof the details in writing. I heard cheaper per month and said “Sure! Do it!”.</review><GmapID>0x54d2c155d04a2c51:0x63bdce0347428f52< /GmapID><username>Ryan Perkins< /username><Time>1530666173547<//Time>< rate>

< review>
Do not go here for ANY service unless you want a hassle with "bait and switch" tactics. Already a long time Verizon customer just needing to upgrade two iPhones. Sales rep tells my wife that since we are buying two phones that it is buy one get one half off PLUS that he can include an IPad for $11.99. She says that sounds to good to be true. Sales rep says "nope promotional deal, no strings attached" ( that should have been the sign something was wrong). Wife confirms verbally multiple times that the total price for the IPad is only $11.99 and that we don't have to add a line....naturally she says sounds good to me, make it happen. Fast forward 4-days later.... she receives notification that the iPad is actually $370 and that the $11.99 was "sales tax" (although it doesn't compute correctly). She also finds out that she was charged full price for both phones! A trip back to get the BOHO in writing to ensure we receive the credit for the iPhone on our account and another trip to return the bogus offer iPad plus paying a $35.00 restocking fee.... well let's just say my wife learned a very valuable lesson. Hope you don't make the same mistake by going here, they are CROOKS!<//review>

My husband went into the store to get help with an extra phone line that we no longer needed and there was absolutely no customer service provided.

The young man was indifferent, useless, rude, and a worthless employee. If this is how verizon is running their stores now and everything is to be computer automated then they should just close the store for good.<//review>

Michael was really cool and nice. He was very knowledgeable and we explored the many options I had at setting up and customizing my experience as a gamer.</Review>

Great Game Stop. My son was admiring the latest DOOM game preorder sign and the cashier offered him a promotional cut out from the game. They go above and beyond here. Bought my switch and all the games for it here.< /review>

Wanted to walk in and get a game but walked out within 30 seconds, gagging. Seriously, get that smell figured out. I don't know how anybody can even work there.</Text>

Stock was minimal, and the unit was very small. The unit next door is abandoned and has a septic leak. The entire store smells like a sewage leak. It's obvious the owner doesn't care and is minimally involved. Worth the drive to Roseville if you're going to spend more than a few minutes inside.<//text>

A small shop, but very well stocked with amazing staff and service as well. That's what I love about GameStop. The people are what brings me in and brings me back again and again. I always appreciate that the most about them. Definitely loved visiting here and would shop again whenever I come back up to this area.</Text>

<Text>Decent stock. I recommend looking online for your game to see the price and location first if there is something you know you want for sure. I had a specific game in mind. I googled GameStop and typed it in. It showed that this location had a great used copy and it was in stock. Cool! I drove over and bought it. I do wish the staff was a little more regular and informative. For people who are very into gaming, we appreciate good staff and quick help. I often have questions or am looking for certain recommendations. They don't always have that. For a small location though, they are good.< /Text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

My local GameStop had no extras and was told to call auburn.  They said they had extras and that they will be released at 9 pm so I would have to show up early to get in line to have a chance at one.  I showed up at 6:30 to get in line and was informed that they had all been sold at 6:00 and that I was too late.  Why was I told that they are going to be sold at 9?  I called the day before they were released.  Very upsetting to have to drive an hour just because someone lied to me.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Placed an order last night to pick up in store. Waited for email to let me know product was ready for pick up. I called  and spoke to Jeremiah to make sure it was ready and to make sure when they close since hourse have change due to virus. Jeremiah told me that they would be closing at 4pm today. I said thanks and made my way to Auburn. Coming from Folsom I was absolutely upset to get to Gamestop and see a sign that said closed for the rest of the day. I got to the store at 3:20pm. If he was planning to close early why not say so when I called at 2:20pm. A waste of an hour of my day and my gas. Please tell customers that have a pick up if you will be closing early. Now I have to drive to Auburn again tomorrow. This is the only store that has the product in stock. Hope this doesn't happen again.</text><rate>1< /rate>< time>

For video-game and TV-show buffs in Auburn, this location holds lots of value in our lives as collectors, gamers, and fans. Great staff, easy access and identification, and moderate prices. Always great to stop by.<//text>

This specific game stop was staffed with some pretty nice informative guys. Honestly I went in there not having a clue about anything game related. On top of that I had 6 kids with me in this small store and they werent bothered at all just helpful and kind.</review>

Bought a game online using the app around 1pm on 4-18-20, waited patiently for 5 hours to get an email back saying my game is ready to be picked up at the store. never got the email all day today. called LOTS of times and not a single answer. store leader is ‘jeremiah’ and im hella upset at the fact i couldnt get an email back all day for a PRE OWNED GAME. step up your customer service please. this was wack.<//review>

So I got a phone call on the 23rd concerning my ultimate edition of red dead redemption 2 preorder letting me know that they were doing pick ups at 9pm on the 25th. Unfortunately I had to work late that night and most of the morning on the 26th. I go in today to pay of the remaining amount as well as trade in a few extra games I had laying around. Just to find out they have no ultimate editions in the store, according to the clerk none came in at all and that there was a delay in the shipment. They checked incoming emails and nothing said anything about any delays. So my question is this how did he know there was a delay if nothing was said about it? Why is it that I dropped $200+ on a preorder to pick it up the day it releases and I have to walk out of that store empty handed? Why did the 2 clerks on duty act like this is a normal thing and made no attempt to fix the situation. All was said was "I'm gonna have to write an email about this." When and if they do get ahold of me letting me know it's in the store since I wasted a trip all the way to that store for nothing, I will be canceling my preorders while I am there. Not going to take the chance of showing up again to pick up my game just to find out they dont have any to give out. This is not how you run a store or any business for that matter. This will be forwarded to the corporate level as well.</Review>

A cool place if you dig hot sauce and are visiting Monterey. A huge selection of hot sauces, salsas, dry rubs, bbq sauces and wing sauces to try on either a spoon or a tortilla chip. I tried every single one and was shocked when the xxx hot salsa snuck up on me and gave me that long lasting burn. Definitely recommended for the spice lovers and even those with a milder palette, they have a huge selection of unique flavors for any taste buds. And you can try them all before you buy!</text>

<Review>I was in Monterey and stopped in to check out Pepper palace. I accidentally grab a spoon without the tongs and the kid behind counter yelled at me. Then he got a major attitude and put on his gloves and dumped all the spoons in the trash can. I love hot sauce but I would never waste my time or buy anything from this store.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Went in the morning and it was super slow never been before and I love me a good hot sauce. Guy with glasses behind the counter wasn’t doing anything and I asked what kind he liked. For some reason he was annoyed with me and said he didn’t like hot sauce. What the heck u doin working at the pepper palace?!?!  Super bad attitude from that kid won’t be back for a while.<//text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><time>1506446501231<//time><Resp>None</Resp><Review>The woman managing the front desk tricked my boyfriend and I into eating beef jerky that was covered in their most hot hot sauce. She announced it was "normal" and "not hot" and offered it to a young girl who refused and my boyfriend who took two pieces. We put them in our mouths on the way out and I immediately spit it out. My nose started running and eyes started watering. My mouth went numb and my ears started to hurt immensely.  My boyfriend,  having actually swallowed the jerky was in a much worse state then I had been in. He had all the symptoms I experienced but worse. He experienced severe nausea and headaches. After buying water and ice cream from a different store and visiting the men's restroom and trying to calm our bodies down we made our way back to the store to ask what was on that jerky. She gave a smug satisfied look and nudged her head to main hot sauce they have on display and said "that one." Anyone who has stepped foot inside knows that eating the main hot sauce is made into a HUGE deal. Where you are filmed and asked to sign a waiver.
Horrible experience to say the least. You may think I am being dramatic but the level of disrespect and disregard for other people displayed that worker that day was disgusting. A number of people in our families have extremely sensitive digestive systems and had it been one of them with us, the day would have ended much worse for everyone.
It was a unnecessary cruel trick and a damn shame considering how great the products in this store actually are. Will no longer be supporting< /Review>< GmapID>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Time>1544154926804</Time><Text>This has to be one of the best sauce stores I've been to (and I've been to a fair share). The store, alone, sports hot sauces ranging from the mild and flavorful to so hot you're crying as you feel the sauce slowly eating your stomach from the inside (this isn't a joke. The End (their challenge sauce) sports a wonderful taste of doom as its 6-7.3 million scoville units ravage your organs). If this isn't fun enough, their staff are a fun bunch, all of them encouraging you to try any of their sauces on the sample bar (be careful though. You might end up buying more than you can use...or not. I don't really know you nor your eating habits).

With a location right in the heart of Monterey, this is a must stop shop for those with even the most delicate of taste buds.<//Text>< name>

Have a hard time not driving down to Monterey for a day or weekend trip and stopping at the Pepper Palace. They have tons of flavors and varieties of hot sauces, salsas, rubs, and more. They sell drinks too in the likelihood you sample something out of your heat range.

I always find one or two bottles to bring home and share, most recent being the Sardine sauce (lol, I just liked the name). $9.95 for a regular sized bottle, kind of a vinegar base with habanero peppers. Really tasty and pretty hot! Stop in and sample some in your in this area!< /text>

The lady attending the shop disregarded us at the register which she was sitting at for minutes on end as she gave directions to a restaurant to a gentleman just standing around. It was rude and idc how good the salsa is. I won't be returning.< /Text>

So when I say I love hot sauce thats a understatment!! This place has different spices and a big variety they seriously have it all!! I feel like I see something new everytime i come  in. I came down to check out the black rose hot sauce  (which is to die for) and the manager was extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the sauces. He was also very patient with me cuz I wanted to sample almost everything in the store . They have chips to do that. Anyways I walked out of the store with a few different hot sauces all thanks to Paris. This is a very well ran company and if your like me, you'll love this spot. Look for Paris, he will help you find the right spices and sauces. I Will be coming back soon . Thanks again Paris for the amazing customer service!<//Review>

This is a used clothing store. Some items are in like new condition others are older.
Good place to find shoes for women.
Also good place for denim pants  for men and women and a much cheaper price than new.</Text>

<Date>1541300066145< /Date><Text>Went around 3pm, only 4 people in there so it was easy to shop around. I really like the quality of the clothes (most of the clothing is aimed at middle school to college girl trendy style). I was looking for a good quality flannel shirt and found it! I think the sizes could use a bit more organization and crop tops be put in one section. I also loved the men's section is good quality. Items are usually &6-$10 but definitely better brands and higher quality than Goodwills. Will be going back to sell some of my clothes that no longer fit me and pick up some more shirts. First time here and the girls there were nice. It was really nice they keep bins behind the desk for customer's items once they are ready to pay. Would be nice if they offered baskets while you shop or bag. Thrift store is located in a nice plaza that made me feel safe going to & from my car. I also liked that you can sign up and earn pts for your purchases.</Text><rate>5< /rate><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Good, it's a gamble on if you find anything that you want that fits but that's expected for second hand goods. Most of it is very great quality. The sales are amazing but you have to be there as soon as they open for the really good grabs.< /text>

2-25-18 This was the 1st time I've ever been to Plato's closet I've heard alot of great and not so great comments in the past. I took my 22yr old son and 14 yr old daughter they both purchased items and are very satisfied customers. The associates seemed a bit busy as I only noticed three working at the time . The front counter (on right in front) associate whom checked us out was very pleasant and explained a little bit regarding some points rewards program. I inquired how to sell items she replied professionally to me but the part of pricing needed to be explained in a slower manner meaning she seemed rushed other than that it was an overall great experience and we'll be back.<//text>

Not my kind of place, I was not satisfied when I seen most of the clothes there too. Not my cup of tea, I prefer shopping at Forever 21, thanks but no thanks. Good luck with your business though, I'm not here to bash Plato's just to leave my opinion.</Text>< Pics>

Took a whole bag of name brand clothing and shoes in great condition and they bought 2 items. Don't waste your time if you are trying to sell. I've been there before and never had problems selling but this time it was a huge waste of my time and gas.<//review>

<review>The WORST STAFF EVER! I never been in there before and right when i walked into the store I automatically received dirty, snobby looks from the girls working. They didn't even WELCOME ME for being new to the store. No biggie tho i looked around the store and wasnt attracted to anything they sold. You should def work on your communication skills and teach your staff to be a bit nicer!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80ea6a768fa59fb9:0x8c21aa09db59a846</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<name>Sandi Harrison< /name><rate>3</rate><Text>this is a different experience if you like shopping for used clothes. Some of them are very nice.
This store is very crowded with clothes on the racks which means they have to really look through to find things.
I am a little disenchanted when they say they're going to have a big sale and you go there and you're expecting the things that are on the Rex to be on sale but they're not they're just big tubs that they put out that have the sale items in it.
So if you drive a long way like we do, where it takes an hour to get there or longer, going into the store to find things that are 75 or 90% off and then have it limited to row of double tubs is not exactly what I would call worth going there for.
I still left the store with a bill of $125 which I feel that I could have also done on a sale at the mall. The jeans were still 20, $25. Hollister  has  sales at that I buy 20, $25 even cheaper sometimes $15 and they're brand new.
Another drawback that I find is when I get out of the canyon and enter Bakersfield I have to go clear across town to do this which is another 15-20 minutes depending on traffic to get there. They only have one store and you can order things online and have them put aside but you can't buy anything online.</Text>< Date>

<Review>I find the place is clean, and organized. If I needed help, then I was able to get it. One issue I didn't like is that I am a name brand purse lover. I have over 18 purses to sell if price was right. I brought two to the store, they had their original boxes, and sales receipt too. I didn't trade them in because rhey were going to only give me less than half.< /Review>< name>

I did not have the experience I would have thought I'd have. I went in with a great amount of clothing items that took me a long time to decide if and where to go and try to get them off my hands. I had 5 pairs of Miss Me jeans in really good condition. I also had multiple other things that were all bought in the mall and in good condition. I understand that the store needs to make a profit but after they went through my clothes , they told me none of my jeans fit their standard which I find very funny because while I was waiting and looking throughout the store, I seen multiple things that looked way too harshly used. They tried offering me $15.00 after going through 40 different items. Obviously I didn't even end up giving them anything because that wasn't for just one item.. that was for 5 different things and they completely refused to take my designer miss me jeans  ! I don't even know how this place stays opened.</review>

I love this store I come here very often ! But every time I visit the store the workers are never welcoming and they always seem too busy to attend. They always have a snobby attitude. But other than that the store it great !😁< /Review>

i love platos. it sucks that it moved so far from me haha. i used to go every weekend now i go once every couple of months. when i do go customer service is great, prices are great, even my bf likes shopping there. only thing that sucks is the parking, sometimes you cant find parking and for the buying of clothes i understand that they cant give much, because that's how they keep their prices low at the store. I get money for stuff just picking up dust in my closet.</Text>

<Text>I came in the other day to sell some boots and Nine West designer bag, all of the boots were gently worn and I also had a pair of surf shoe Vans that were like new and they only took one pair of boots for $5. I know that Plato's closet is super picky with what they take but before knowing they would only take one pair of boots I was looking around at their shoes and saw all of them way over worn with foot stains, super dirty and with rips. I cleaned my shoes before hand and when the girl told me they only took one item I was super shocked because all of their shows were 10x worse then the ones I took in. Also when I went in the girl said it would take 30 minutes cause she was helping another lady and when she was done I went to go sit in a chair near her and she's doing some things and looks up at me after like 10 minutes she says did you need something? To be honest the customer service at this store is super low, if anything they should be more appreciative because thanks to people like us they have all those clothing items and accessories.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Horrible place! It smells bad..I brought in some new sweaters, wallets, shoes etc barely used all brands and I was told that she couldn't take it because they were used.. I was walking through the store seen shoes with stains, dirty, faded away you name it and they were there for sale my things looked 10 times newer and better than what they had there. They ended up taking only two new shirts with tags and prizes of $60+ for only a few dollars. I'm definitely not coming back. Don't recommend it at all..</Review><Rate>1<//Rate><gmapID>0x80ea6a768fa59fb9:0x8c21aa09db59a846< /gmapID><Date>1480372965956</Date><user>100161347405668342676<//user>< response>

I think it is sad that your store does not carry nor buy clothing over size 15/16. I had 100 items all from Torrid/INC Plus (Maceys)/Verra Wang and other name brands and was told your store doesn't carry nor buy plus size clothing. Mine were size 18. I will NEVER step foot in your store. Do you not feel that plus size teens/young adults should be able to get affordable plus size clothing.<//Text>

<review>They need to buy clothes in bigger sizes everything the have is lame . I brought in a ton of cute items that would help fill the void but they only bought 30 things out of about 200 pieces I had with me. They passed on nice Miss Me jeans and BKE jeans in good condition. They didn't buy them and they only have about 10 pairs of size 13 on the rack. I don't understand . they buy the ugly stuff and return the good to me. Doesn't make sense. They are losing money this way. The manager should totally reach out to m e for some advise</review>< Pictures>

When you need to buy school clothes for your kids, what better idea than to go into plato's closet? The clothes are the exact same as they would be in the mall, except 10 times cheaper. I found Miss Me's for my Daughter for $35! Beats the original $100 pants at Buckle. Yes, they are minorly used clothes but your getting your moneys worth! I can finally buy an outfit for my kids under $30. They can now fill the need to expand there wardrobe if they like, because now as a mother of three i can afford top brand clothing.< /Text>

Went in and had awful customer service. I brought all my clothes in neatly folded and organized and got them back thrown in a box. I asked to have help folding them and it was an  inconvenience for them. Staff is rude and no one bothers to help you. Definitely not selling my clothes here again nor shopping. Worst first experience ever :(< /Review>

<Text>So I usually don't have a hard time with customer service here but I visited the new location and took in one bag of clothing , some new jeans some lightly used , and also a  handbag ( leather great condition ) . Waited 45 minutes for one staff member to pass by me & yell " your Buy is ready!" as I'm looking at clothing & shoes . Go up to the counter & the lady hands me my bag & says with an attitude " unfortunately we weren't able to look at anything because [gets louder] THEY NEED TO BE WASHED" I washed my clothing prior to coming in so i didn't understand . I felt discriminated against because most of everything was new that I brought in & the hand bag was on top ( can't wash that) & they didnt take that either . I was also going to purchase more items being that I had a $10 off coupon from the store on Ming to use at the new location , instead I relaxed and left . CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SHXTTY!
I PROBABLY WON'T GO BACK !<//Text>< Gmap_id>

The staff is nice. They suck when it comes to turning in clothes. They say everything is old styles when really it's bran new items. They seem to be getting worse and worse stuff since they moved across town. I want put out there this is a TEEN store. It doesn't not carry anything made for women 30+ years.<//Review>

<Date>1513557508258<//Date>< Review>
So I just waited at least 2 1/2 hours for them to go through 2 bags of clothes I brought in. They said 45 mins. I noticed, as they were paying me, it had been done for a while they just didn't put my name up on the board or attempt to call my name. Now the last time I had gone in to do this they told me kind of a different view on what they would buy and the girl was very pleasent. So i went along those guidelines this time. I got a whoping $12.84 for 9 items. Last time they bought 3 items for a little bit over $20. Most of the employees today had somewhat of an attitude. Made me feel unwelcomed and looked down upon. And waisted my time! Get your S%#& together Plato's Closet and lose the attitude</Review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Been going here for years, the staff changes a lot but they're always catty and annoying, worst place to try and sell your clothes but if you're dirt poor like I am, their selection is WAY better than goodwill or any other secondhand shop I've ever been to. They make Ross and Walmart look pricey  and they're way cheaper than ebay. too, and they're always getting more items. They have stuff you would pay $20 or $50 for at the mall for under $10.  If you have money to buy new you'd probably have better luck elsewhere, but if you're like me and can't even afford Walmart, this is the best place to buy clothes.< /review>< pics>

They dont buy enough high end clothes. They wouldn't purchase anything i had by ralph lauren, calvin klein, or tommy Hilfiger. So theres basically no reason to return.
Those websites were listed directly on their website.</Text>

<text>I went in here about eight years ago and they were rude then and they were rude again today.  I dropped off a pile of Polo shirts mostly.  Real Polos, Ralph Lauren Polos and I was told it would be about 45 minutes to appraise them.  Some of them still had the tags on them, I never wore them.  I came back 45 minutes later and was told that they didn't take Polos.  You couldn't tell me that 45 minutes prior?  The reason:  Polos are too sophisticated.  The Polo is too sophisticated for these people.  The standard for casual wear for decades is just too sophisticated.  That tells you how trashy this place is.</text>< pics>

This Place sucks and if you try to sell your clothes they won't buy them. On the other hand they will have faded holy ass clothes with stains on the racks. Get a better staff and and better clothes Platos. #wasteofa buildingspace#inmaturestaff#closedownalready!<//Text>

They always comment and apologize and say they are going to train their staff on better customer service but that's never going to change. It's been like this since they opened their store in Bakersfield. There are always snobby employees and laughing and gossiping instead of doing their jobs. I was trying to sell some clothes and they told me it would be 30 mins and they would write my name on a board when my buy was complete. Well that 30 mins was actually almost 2 hours and they still never wrote my name on the board. I had to ask if it was complete. So I was just waiting there and I even left to go walk around other near by stores just because I got tired of walking around their store for 45 mins. I wasn't stressing on waiting 30 mins but after that I couldn't bare staying in the store any longer. I had everything nicely folded and organized by category to make things easier for them and instead they made it HARDER for me.< /Review><Name>Alyssa Breann< /Name><UserId.>115799410515962681114</UserId.><Time>1471716948819</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rating>1<//Rating>< Response>

<Review>This place is a rip off! My friend and I brought in a bag of clothes all pretty much brand new, some still with tags on! They said they could only take 2 items out of the whole bag and could only give me $6 for them. Of course they took two of the items with the tag still on 😂. This place is a joke.<//Review><UserId.>114642879820246850513< /UserId.></record>

They only wanted to purchase 4 of my items out of a goldmine of designer clothes and offered me only $10 for them all.  Uhhhh no thanks. I will continue to sell my stuff on ebay. I will get WAY more money doing that. Also, when I arrived I was told 20 minutes, and I waited an hour.  I got there 10 minutes after they opened and they said only one person was ahead of me.

<Date>1622855051636</Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>This is a great park with a number of amenities for kids of all ages. Shaded overhead enclosures fenced in for little ones to go explore, cool "mountains" to climb on and a rubberized floor for low impact cushion, swings for babies up through teen, and a large water feature area to cool off the kids son hot days. Add in the green space (probably half a football field size?... Maybe a bit more?) and it's a solid space for spending some time out at the park!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb7b568c5445f:0xf349e84292324494< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Love the play area dedicated for the infants and toddlers here. Not only it is full of entertainment for them, from sand to swing, but it is also covered, which means things such as sliders do not get hot and impossible to use. The big kids, lawn, dog area and water parts are also pretty nice.</Review>< Rate>

Beautiful park! The park has different playgrounds for all age kids ( little kids playgroundis gated). They have a splash pad where kids can run around and get wet.  There's a dog park, basketball courts,tennis 🎾. You can also take a beautiful walk around the grass field.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Wow,  this park is right up there with Dennis the Menace park in Monterrey. There was several different sections to the park (dog park,  tennis court,  half court for basketball,  enclosed toddler section, larger area for the older kids,  and a grassy area to walk around). It was busier than expected,  but everyone had their mask on (except for young toddlers).  The more unique aspect of the park was the Treasure Hunt and Scavenger Hunt.  The kids had a lot of fun looking for the stuff there while playing on all the slides.  My boys are 4 and their cousins are 6 and 8, respectively; everyone had a lot of fun running around.  It was great that all the kids and parents there was respective of others. Would highly recommend this park.<//Text>< Pictures>

A really wonderful park! Very large playground that any kid would enjoy, a gated tennis court, half basketball court, large open grass field, and a walking path around the park. The park feels very safe and spacious due to being in a residential area.<//review>

One of our favorite parks.. it has sand pit, water area and most importantly for those with young kids/toddlers a shaded area.. BUT, bad city planning.. there is no parking in the area relative to demand.. it's a real pain.. 5 star park, 0star city planning = 4 star<//Text>

This park has everything. It has tennis courts, a fenced in toddler play area, an older kids play area, short walking trails, a dog park, large open field, half court of basketball, and a set of fountains kids can play in during the summer months. The park is very interactive for the children. The one thing this park can't do is disappoint.<//review>

Great park, safe and separate playgrounds for different ages.  There's also a dog park that is enclosed.  Overall really clean, and fun for the kids.  The only drawback is lack of parking.<//text>

Easy access in a neighborhood close to a freeway. It is linked to a walking path too.
The park has many benches  and designated areas for interests of children and adults.
Parking can be difficult if it is busy.<//Review>

This park has everything. It has tennis courts, a fenced in toddler play area, an older kids play area, short walking trails, a dog park, large open field, half court of basketball, and a set of fountains kids can play in during the summer months. The park is very interactive for the children. The one thing this park can't do is disappoint.<//Text>

<text>Park is awesome. Lots of well maintained structures. The only downside is the parking with 7 slots.

The theme is the sea and is divided in two which is for toddler and for older. Each part are covered and have several palm trees.

Restrooms available, basketball field and limited table to eat are available.</text>< pics>

Nice park for a walk in the evenings. Definitely a good place to go out and play some sports. Usually gets a bit crowded in the evening. There is separate play ground area for kids to enjoy.</Text>

Great park to keep your kids distracted with an all you can eat buffet of slides, gizmos, and swings. Plenty for the kids to do, and places for the older crowd a well. Facilities were clean when I was there, and the area was maintained well.<//Review>

I'd give it 4.5 stars of I could, but only because of the limited parking when crowded. You have to hope yo find nearby parking, because the lot is very small and there is only limited street parking available.

Otherwise, an excellent park for all ages. Lots of shade options plus the water feature on really hot days is nice. Very clean and well kept.</Review>

<Review>Amazing for kids. Big and clean. Playing structures for all ages, as well as the basketball and tennis courts. Big patch of grass. However there is no shade so it gets pretty hot in the summer, despite the water park area there. My son loves it.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

< review>
Wonderful park for toddlers and elementary age kids. There is a fenced in area with sand, slides, and swings. There is a splash pad that is open in the summertime and there is an area with a pirate ship for older kids. There is also a basketball court and tennis court and an area with grills and a bathroom. This park can get very busy during the summer and the parking lot is very small. I usually park on the street and walk to the park. The only reason this park doesn’t get a five star review is because parking can be difficult.<//review>

<Review>This is a decent park there are very nice play areas for kids of different ages. It seems to be designed with safety in mind the chances of injury seem very low compared to other similar parks. Finding parking is difficult in the official parking spots. There is a private parking lot at the back of the park which is very close.<//Review>< Rate>

Parking is horrible unless you utilize the parking lot accessible from the other side of the block. Huge playground area for kids. There's a dedicated dog park area but it's super small.< /text>

Love this park 😍 tennis & basketball courts, mini dog park, water play area, two areas for different age groups. The seven seas theme is very cute. Great for toddlers and elementary age kids. We try to come here for playdates. Parking is limited so come early.</text>

<Text>One of the best parks in south bay with a pirate ship theme, big kid area, little kid area, sandpit, musical instruments, large field and tennis courts this park is the place to be. In the Sunmer months there is a water feature to play in. My son and I spend on average two hours here at a time. The park is busy so parking can be a little hard at times, but worth it.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

This park is great: it has a fenced playground for little kids and a larger open one for bigger kids. It also has a nice water splash area during summer. Lots of grass is also something I like. The reason it does not get 5 stars is the lack of shades and difficulty to park... During weekends is nearly impossible to find a parking spot nearby.</text>

It's a really fun park. I wish it had more shade; even the fenced off area for younger kids was extremely sunny and hot.
There's a small dog park, a splash pad area, and plenty of play structure for kids of all ages. There's a little sand area in the smaller playground too. We will definitely return.< /Review>

Nice water play area with shaded playground. Bathrooms easily accessible.  Only downside is that parking is a bit tricky as the parking lot is ridiculously small, so you have to find it in the street.<//Review>

<Date>1527057318700< /Date><rate>5< /rate><review>Awesome park! Great for babies and toddlers, especially with the gated play area for smaller kids. We love this park. It's usually pretty busy but not so that kids can't play easily. The two bathrooms are generally clean and well-maintained. The water play is great for hot days, but there isn't too much shade around that area for caregivers. The parking lot only has a handful of spots and street parking is limited. If you're willing to walk a block you can still find parking.<//review>< pics>

There is a sand pit and tables, too.  The only drawback is the lack of big trees for shade so it can get quite warm in summer.<//text>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><text>It's a beautiful park with lots of play areas and equipment for kids. There's a small field for athletic play (think frisbee, soccer) and even an enclosed dog play area. There's also a single tennis court and a half court of basketball. There's also a water splash area for kids that works in the summer. All this near several picnic areas with charcoal BBQ stands.

Zooming out, it is in the middle of the John F. Christian Greenbelt, and is a short charming stroll away from the Orchard Gardens park, which is much smaller but has two more tennis courts.

Great place to spend an afternoon or few with friends, family, kids and dogs 😊<//text>< pics>

Beautiful and clean park. Has water play for kids. BBQ area, two play areas for small and big kids. Parking is hard to find but we usually find off street parking so it’s not a big issue.</Text>

Clean park with separate covered play area for smaller kids/babies. Has sand pit, swings, slides and water sprinkler area that kids love. This park has parking and a path around the grass for walking.<//text>

<Review>I have been going since its grand opening. If you play Ingress, the park has portals about every 10 feet. Designed for kinds, lots of safety features such as padded rubber floors in the main activity area. Good for small group picnics. Restrooms in the center, basketball and tennis courts near the street. Unfortunately the parking lot only hold half a dozen cars, and another 7 or 8 might fit on-street. Not nearly enough. There is a tiny dog park section, just a sand floor. Big grassy area is sometimes co-opted by non-city organized activities.<//Review>< GmapID>

Such a wonderful park, especially during the off-hours. Be mindful of the weekends, however, as the crowds make navigating the equipment more cumbersome (if you need to chase after little ones).</text>

This is one of the best parks around for kids and family! We all love it. My parents and I usually bring our daughter here a few times a week and she can easily spend a couple of hours each time. A lot of nice kids and families around this area and you will usually see quite a number of them every time. It makes the park feel lively and full of cheerful atmosphere. Lots of different variety of things for kids (small or big) to entertain themselves. There is a separate section just for younger babies. A dog park is nearby and my daughter loves to see those cute dogs every time we go to this park. Overall, a well-kept park with lots of fun things for kids to play and interact. The big lawn there is also perfect for family outing and picnic. We love it!< /Text>

Very well designed and fun park for kids. Parking is extremely limited as only six parking space and two disabled parking. It seems trying to more benefit for walking distance neighbors as designed. I've never seen such a parking limitation any other park. If you can park, kids would enjoy very well. Thank you.<//review>

A very family friendly and cheerful park in the middle of many homes where children do not have room to play in their own yards.     A terrific amount of thought has gone into the planning and development of this beautiful play land.   Thanks to all who have participated in the putting of it together and following thorough.

Hopefully vandals will leave it alone so continued use can go on without incident...</review>

Great park in a very nice neighbourhood. Has a single tennis court, play area for kids of all age -- grass area for football and outdoor sports lovers. You can often find parents and kids enjoying a good stroll in the evening. Some of the other amenities include:-

1. Basketball court
2. Benches for senior citizens
3. Walking path across the park

Ideal for an evening run, kids to cycle and play and parents to meet.<//review>

Nice and clean park with a spacious kids play area. It has a nice jogging track, tennis court and basketball half court too. Gets slightly busy if one chooses to go at a popular time.< /review>

<Text>Our favorite park in Sunnyvale.  Big and a lot of unique play structures.  There are lots of other things around the grassy area.  It's clean and well kept.  The water play in summer is a lot of fun.  The only down side is the parking.  There are only enough places for about 5 cars in the lot and limited street parking.  Bummer.< /Text>< Pics>

We're visiting from out of town with a 1.5yr old. This playground was great. The younger kids section is fenced off so you can let them roam around without worrying as much. There are only a few parking spots but plenty of room on the street. The restroom was out of paper but overall it was clean.< /review>

Wonderfully set out for lots of activities , water spouts, small fountains and overhang bucket , central covered kids play area with rubberised floor, different sets of swings and good sets of monkey bars , overall ur kid will enjoy this park, one word of caution very very limited parking slots in fronts and road parking on road gets filled , try the back side parking which has good number of slots.</Review>

One of most kid friendly parks in the vicinity . Is more modernized and well maintained . it's a smallish one compared to Cuesta and that the only thing that would have bumped to 5 star<//Review>

So this park is sandwiched between a Korean megachurch and a fascist HOA, so it's not really anybodys neighborhood park.  There's no cozy neighborhood crowd. Everybody has to drive at least one neighborhood over to get there, and Sunnyvale isn't the kind of place anyone comes from anyhow. The result is that everyone's kids play with themselves and any friends they came with. both neighbors have liberally deployed signs saying no parking here by you for any purpose ever, so parking is an issue for non scofflaws. The pirate theme is consistent throughout and well executed. The crazy water play area is awesome until labor day each year. A very well appointed lonely place.<//review>

<Review>I had no problem finding parking but apparently I got lucky. I got there afternoon on a weekday. My 1 and 2 year old loved it here, nice water feature and ocean theme all around. There are 2 playgrounds of wich one is gated with a sandbox area. Both are short in dimensions, having little ones in mind. So I will say it's targeted for children maybe up to 6 years old, more or less, as every child is different. Clean, fun, wet, and entertaining. We loved it!<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fb7b568c5445f:0xf349e84292324494< /gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<Review>Great kids park for a number of reasons:  safe neighborhood, pirate ship themed (newly constructed?) play area, separate GATED tot play area, overall cleanliness, and last but not least -- an engaging water play area. I'd suggest giving the Sunnyvale Parks and Rec a call to determine the hours/dates of operation though.</Review>< pics>

One of the best parks around.  New, unique, many different areas, some natural areas. Gets super duper crowded on Friday afternoon or after work due to the high density of apartments surrounding it.  Not very diverse at times.< /Text>

<review>This is an incredible Park for very young kids, and also the older ones who run faster and play harder. There is a fenced-off area with tons of activities for the very young toddler and preschool crowd. In warmer weather there is a splash pad. There is a fenced-in dog run to one side of the park.</review>< user_id>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Love this park.  There's 2 playgrounds, one is enclosed so littles can't escape. There's a sandbox and a splash pad, various noisemakers throughout the park, a teeter totter, basketball and tennis courts, and a large grass area. It also connects to a wakk/bike trail.< /text><UserId.>105046828299709258314</UserId.><gmap_id>0x808fb7b568c5445f:0xf349e84292324494<//gmap_id>< resp>

Great park for younger kids. There is a water feature as well from 10am-6pm. I find there is not enough shade in the area though.. So, we had to just sit on the floor and keep moving with the sun<//Review>

A nice community park, with playing ground for ages  above one. Also there is a dog playground. Popular location for picnic and birthday parties.

Parking during weekends are extremely limited.</Review>

I love everything about this park. I was there today and there were parking officials warning people to make sure they don't park in front of the park on the side of the street. Next time I bring my daughter here I'm taking her bike. Lots of space!!<//Review>

Very little parking for the size of the park, but a nice place to bring the kids otherwise. Shade sails cover a number of the play areas which is a nice feature.< /Text>

Has everything for man's best friend and kids.  Kids park is well shaded, splash pad is fun.  My only complaint is the dog park is all sand which is hard to clean out of dogs fur when bathing and the smaller kids park is a little dirty.< /text>

If the dogs in the park aren't a bucket of fun you can take your dog for a walk about.  Lots of path to walk and grass to smell.

< Review>
One of the best parks we have been visiting . Our 5 year old has been going since she was 2 and has not got bored yet. Play area & structures are recently built (few years). Lots of kids - regardless of time of day. There is a cool water area that is operational during spring and summer time. There is a seperate fenced toddler area with sand boxx , swings and slides.

There is also a very nice fenced dog park next to it. Finally, there is a basketball court and a wide open park to throe ball around.

Parking can at times be a pain due to limited space but you can always find space on the road<//Review>

One of the better parks in Sunnyvale, pirate themed. There's this courts, a small basketball court, a dog park, a small child area fenced in, and a larger kid area. There are chimes to play and a field trip walk around.</review>

Great park, but can get very crowded and you typically end up having to park across the street in the apartment parking lot.

But a very nice park with lots of variety.< /review>

My kids love it here. Has just enough playground things to keep them busy for a few hours and have them leave drained and tired, this is something all of us Mamas and Papas want, isnt it?</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x808fb7b568c5445f:0xf349e84292324494</Gmap_id><review>(Translated by Google) A park with a sea theme. There is a fence in the area for young people and there is a sandbox. There is a corner where you can play in the summer. The difficulty is that it is always busy (even on weekdays!) And it is difficult to stop at the parking lot.

海をテーマにした公園。低年齢向けエリアは柵があり、砂場もあり。夏場は水遊びできるコーナーもある。いつも（平日でも！）賑わっていて駐車場に停めづらいのが難点。<//review><pics>None< /pics><user_name>jumboree128< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<userid>112780979572612178649<//userid><Review>(Translated by Google) This is the best Playground nearby. There are rubber pads underneath. The facilities are big and there are big and small children to play. The other playgrounds are covered with softwood.
