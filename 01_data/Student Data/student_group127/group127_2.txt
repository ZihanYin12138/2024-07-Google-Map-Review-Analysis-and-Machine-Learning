<review>My boyfriend and I brought our cars here to be cleaned. He has an Audi Q8 and I have a Fiat 500. They told us that neither of our cars would fit in their system. When we all know this isn’t true. They did the same thing to others in previous reviews, when they had brought the same cars here and they fit then suddenly one day they don’t? It makes no sense. They also have a giant sign saying they accept competitor coupons when they accept nothing. It would have been one thing if they were apologetic about the cars “not fitting” and price gouging for a hand wash, but they were rude and unprofessional. We wash our cars weekly and regret trying this place out. Would never recommend. Go to Beach City’s down the street.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bada1afd6555:0x3e3636f019ea599d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Second time there. First my car got back with plenty of detail parts dirty. Now I got the "luxury wash" and they return my car like this. I didn't complain because I am really exhausted by people's incompetence or disregard. I'll finish it by myself. If you want a really superficial clean and are too lazy to do it by yourself, and have 20 dollars to trow away, you can go, if not stay away.<//Text>

Rude!  Pretty sure they could care less about my business even though I have been loyal for years.
Attendants adjust prices, inconsistent.
Last week I paid 10.00 for mat cleaning.
They didn’t even clean my mats.
This week I went in and they want to charge me 20.00!
I politely decided to leave and the attended just says ok! And waved bye bye...
Bye bye Bonus 🥺< /review>

< review>
This place has really gone downhill. My third of three bad experiences with a wash here in the last few months. Refuse to do the actual work to fix it and claim you just didn’t pay enough, despite it clearly stating they will vacuum the interior of the car and wipe it down. Car was just detailed 1.5 weeks prior, and was not that dirty coming in except for typical kid stuff. The management is extremely rude and unfriendly from the time you pull in to the wash.< /review>

<Text>Stay away! High prices,  5 minute sloppy wash and horrible customer service. They were caught over charging me on top of the already high prices and then the manager became angry and defensive saying he "doesn't care". Now I know why this place is never busy when I drive by. Others have decided to stay away also.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rating>

Super disappointed with this place. Will never come again. I payed $70 for interior and exterior clean and got it back with dust and sand still in the floor and on my dash board, and bird poop still on the front. Really?! Go somewhere else.<//Text>

There were some little spots that they missed but I got the cheapest package ($18 at the time of review) so I can't really complain. Overall it was as expected. For a more thorough wash I'd go somewhere more expensive.< /review>

<Text>PLEASE LISTEN TO EVERYONE THAT GAVE THIS CAR WASH 1 STAR!. I am not confrontational.  I'm one of those extreme introverts, so it's hard for me to speak my mind. My white Camry was very dirty due to this uncanny LA weather  . I couldn't take it any more and was passing by so I stopped.  $30.00 for THE WORST car wash ever. They apparently have a quota(watch how quick they dry and wipe down) . Bird poop, dirt and water was running and dripping from my car.  When I asked for him to PLEASE wipe, he appeared to have an attitude.  Mind you, it was pretty busy and it ONLY took 20 minutes.  Shows you how much time they spend on the cars. I am thoroughly disgusted and will never return. (Btw, I stood there using the water from my car to wipe it down. No one even offered help.  I didn't  even bothered to inform the manager, felt it wouldn't do any good.<//Text>< Rating>

I love this car wash it is so fast and the price is very fair. Even the most basic car wash will live your car clean and ready to roll. I'm usually in a rush to get to work but this place is speedy. Free vacuum available after your car wash which can extend to reach every part of your car. I've been here twice already and this is definitely my go to.</Review>

I paid for the #1 superwash which come with interior and exterior cleaning and extras (look at the menu for extras) but when I got my car I had spots all over the outside, undercarriage was still dirty too, dusty inside, even my windows still had spots and specks. must not care about other customers when there rent and profit  is covered from the guarenteed buisness they get from the city contract to clean city vehicles and police vehicles.😞 really disappointed because I used to work for the city and would take the fleet of vehicles here to get washed. So I thought it would be a good idea to bring my personal vehicle here...wrong !🙁😕😬</review>< Pictures>

If I could give them 0 stars I would.  I had just returned from driving a road trip I do often, so obviously the car was dirty.  When I pulled up, the attendant asked what I wanted and I said a basic wash.  As he was about to write the ticket I informed him I had a coupon.  He then looked at me and said "this car is too dirty yo wash, it will be a minimum of $50".  I really thought he was kidding....  a car too dirty to wash?  What does that even mean?  These guys are scammers with their coupons.  If you have one post what excuse they give you to not honor it.  This car wash is awful!< /text>

<Review>The car never comes back entirely clean. They give the car a once over wipe. Whatever is cleaned off is cleaned off and whatever remains is left.

Also never pay full price. The guy always offers deals. You can negotiate and are never sure just how much you are overpaying.

Compared to other carwash places, they at least don't leave towel lint all over the car.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2bada1afd6555:0x3e3636f019ea599d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I love that you can stay in your car while it gets washed :) yes I'm lazy. I just hate you have to do the vacuuming and cleansing inside yourself but they make it fast and easy by providing a stall that has vacuums on each side they also have machines that have what you need to properly clean just bring your quarters and they have no ATM.</text>

They left water spots on my black matte paint and waxes over it. Now I am not sure if my paint is ruined now. Will have to wait until the wax fades after many washes. I hope not. I knew I should have just washed my own damn car‼️‼️ 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️

Went in for a wax and the did an excellent job. Cleaned the interior and exterior. Very happy with the service. Will be going back.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>I've brought my car here twice in the last four months for the $59.99 wash/wax/wheels + interior cleaning package. Service was friendly, and the job was done well and completed in a timely fashion.

And you can buy a snack or drink and hang in the outdoor waiting area.

It's becoming my go-to car wash.</text>< Pictures>

I need a new car wash place.  I have put up with Bonus Car Wash (on Lincoln) rude up-selling practices, BUT now I am not returning.  I paid extra to have the inside of the car cleaned....they did a poor job, but I decided to let it go...UNTIL I looked in the back of the car...where the plastic areas had NOT been touched at all.  Drove there to show them the problem..and  what i got was "come back on Thursday when the manager is in". I asked if I could get a card, so I could call and was told to look it up on the internet! Not the place to go if you want customer service.< /Text>

I brought the car in for specific issue that needed to be cleaned driver door, radio, inside windshield and other places. It is convertible and the top was down. When they gave me the car...none of what needed to be cleaned was done. They fought with me and said because of the issue it would cost an additional $100. When I got home and put the top up...they had not cleaned it or the back window. The manager was rude about it. They also kept speaking in Spanish when not speaking to me.< /Review>

The guys who initially took the car and did the vacuuming were all very pleasant but it wasn't a fabulous wash. It was an OK car wash. Pro: 😀 it didn't take very long.   They say they take all competitors coupons but when I tried to use one there was some confusion about it. I did point out that the sign said all competitors coupons. The young lady was very nice and did apologize and rectify the mistake.  I would come here again if I were in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.< /review>

I've given this place multiple chances as it's right across the street from my house and super convenient, but I definitely won't be going back after this last time. I'm nearly positive they just upsell people on things (tire shine, sealer, etc) but don't actually relay the information to the people that are finishing the job, so the products you purchase don't actually get applied. I requested that they remove some residue from a sticker that was on my windshield and was told it was "no problem". I also was upsold tire shine. Neither of these things were completed when I got my car back. I've also been super disappointed with the quality of the clean on more than one occasion. Dirt that clearly should have been wiped up/vacuumed up. Just not very thorough. Definitely not worth the money.< /text>

My experience at this place has been ok.  Better than some car washes, but by no means the best.  The best thing they have going for them is that the employees are unionized, so presumably getting fair wages.  What I don't like: the up-sell pitch they give you.<//Review>

<text>Came in today with a big problem, when an approximately 10 inch wide splotch of fresh sap landed on my hood while parked at the nearby Sunday Farmer's Market. The gentlemen in the check-in line took the time to carefully remove the sap and buff out the hood, with no residual damage visible. The wash itself was no better or worse than anyone else's wash, but I'm giving them give stars for their emergency service!<//text><time>1401046044770<//time><resp>None< /resp>< user_name>

They take a long time
Almost a 1/2 hour
But the best car wash in town
Since they closed Wilshire / 25th
Nice selection of greeting cards in their gift shop
Excellent coffee
Anyone in a wheelchair would be very comfortable here, they seem to have gone to great lengths to make it fully accessible
Also, sparkly clean
I like that they offer gas too</review>

<Text>If you want get your new car damaged by Bonus Car wash and pay for the damage yourself -Bonus Car wash is the place to go. Took my new BMW for wash they broke my reflector.  Had to wait for 10 days and drive around with missing part.  Today I found myself in the area and my car was very dusty so I went back to give this place another chance.  Secured my reflectors with the tape to prevent from breaking.  Manager Rafael, started yelling at me that if they break any parts of may car or damage it I will pay out of my pocket.  He clearly told me never come back.  Good luck with your business of yelling at your clients and breaking their new cars, Rafael!<//Text>< rating>

<Date>1431537805824</Date><Review>I was driving by and wanted to give it a try. I have a Tesla and the front guy told me that it can't be a regular wash, it has to be an outside hand wash. I'm experienced with car washes, a friend of mine owned a few of those and I know for a fact that a machine wash is just as good - no difference in terms of scratching, etc. I asked him why and without blushing or blinking an eye, he immediately answered that the tunnel is too low for a Tesla.

I have no problem to pay $25 vs $14 as you can tell but I hate being lied to in the most blatant manner. I just got back into my car and left for the other car wash on Lincoln (Millenium). Don't do business with scammers. It's a matter of pride and justice. Never going back.</Review><user>102084828789545282915</user>< resp>

<Text>Mediocre wash. Pointed out a discoloration from bird $h!t in my paint and the first guy said “nothing can be done” while the manager refused to address it as well. Go here if you want a mediocre and slightly overpriced car wash.

Update: got home and it took me literally 10 seconds with some rubbing compound to fix the paint. What a joke. Never again. Unhelpful, lousy service. Go elsewhere.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>DONT GO TO THIS PLACE

The worst place for washing car. When I went the guy told me no problem you can wash your car but if it's raining come back on Friday for free wash and if you forget your receipt bring the yellow stamp. So I came back friday with my stamp and an other guy told me that I have to bring my receipt so I went to my home took my stuff and when I came to the car wash the guy told me sorry we can't wash your car !!!!

we've been coming to bonus for year but last week I had a small issue with them but nothing that a simple soultion couldnt fix however when I spoke to the manager,  I was shocked at his crude manners, total rudeness and unprofessional etiquette.   His name was Raphael and he is the reason he a lost a 5 car house hold.  Raphael. You should learn how to treat people with respect especially when they are paying customers.< /review>

I live 2 blocks away from this place & just cant go here anymore. The place is run totally sketchy. They talked me into buying a booklet of prepaid basic car washes & the benefit was you get 1 free car wash (the 11th)  which equates to a little over 10% off for them. Every time I use one and I don't upgrade the basic wash they actually warn me that the basic wash isn't that good. Before I bought the booklet the basic was fine but when you redeem the coupons they do a very noticeably bad job like today they put the garbage back in my car instead of throwing it away!!!! It was just a couple paper bags & a dry cleaning plastic bag both on the floor balled up, but still. AND I was second in line and they let me car sit for almost 20 minutes!! & pulled 7 cars that came in after me thru and waited till there were No More cars before they even started vaccuuming my car. Totally scam place,  really low grade job and there are 2 other cars washes with in a half mile in both directions -
Lincoln Car Wash
1624 Lincoln Blvd
Santa Monica, CA 90404
&
Bonus Car Wash
2800 Lincoln Blvd
Santa Monica, CA 90405

Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this ghetto low grade bad service lazy place!!<//Text>

Craving BBQ? Lots of melt-in-your mouth brisket? Fork tender smoked chicken? Budget friendly?

The Smok'd Hog is highly recommended for their food, their earth friendly ware, and again, this can't be stressed enough -- their food.

If you haven't tried them yet, you should have done so yesterday.</Review>

<text>First visit to this establishment.  As an avid BBQer/smoker, I like try different styles.  I ordered the brisket & two sides.
The brisket was very fatty and tough.  I wasn’t getting much flavor from the meat either.  It didn’t help that the utensils are made of disposable wood.  I could not cut the brisket as it was too tough & fatty.  It is a rare thing not to finish a serving of brisket, but I couldn’t eat it.  Maybe just a bad cut of meat.  The BBQ sauce was an odd flavor to me as well.
A bright spot were the baked beans & slaw.  I enjoyed those very much.

Overall, not impressed< /text>< pics>

<Review>Ordered chili and baked beans. Was not satisfied with the style of food, and brought my issue to the manager Chris. He switched out my items with a mound of the best brisket I've had in recent memory, and no fluff.

Succulent Southern smoked meats and sides. Part of a new mini-food Place planning LLP hall in Vail Village a short drive from Main Street Temecula.

Meats are super tasty and cooked to perfection. Smoky and spicy pork, brisket, chicken. Loved the pulled pork and Cuban sandwiches.< /Review>

<Text>I'd read online that this placed served a Cubano Sandwich, a real favorite when I lived in New York City.  The restaurant is a food counter within a mini food court called The Cookhouse in a very cute retail development called Vail Headquarters.  It's the site of an historic old ranch, with modern theming to match, surrounded by strip malls along Temecula Parkway.  To cut to the chase, I didn't like my Cubano.  The food was high quality, if very pricey and small but certainly large enough to satisfy.  But they used heavily smoked and BBQ-rubbed pork which didn't marry well, I thought, with the traditional Cubano ingredients of swiss cheese, mustard and pickles.  I don't mind "re-inventing" classic foods as long as the result is tasty.  This was just bizarre and kind of unpleasant.  Sorry.  No seating indoors now for Covid 19 but plenty of picnic tables outdoors.  And plenty of free parking adjacent.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80d954e91ad21717:0xdd965868faa35ec6<//Gmap_id>< rating>

<Time>1537576119130<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>The best bbq in San Diego. Not very big menu, but everything they have is very delicious! My favorites are pulled pork and chicken, with side of coleslaw. But we've tried their sandwiches as well, and they are really, really good.
It's a small place, they have about 4 tables and a counter on the side.< /Review>< response>

<text>The Cubano sandwiches are quite tasty, but definitely a small sandwich for the price. Ordered the 2meat 2side as well, it was a good portion for the price, although when it comes to the taste...not much there and the meats are very dry. Macaroni n cheese was tasty, but the tater salad was also kind of dry. Kind of a disappointment.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIOwc6iDjR_wt5EHUOt4DIDcAbCpfxzc0aLtiH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7TR59sh2kQYx8hsfHbZneQBoORrLzqGmEJ2MF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I love BBQ. I grew up in the Midwest with steak and BBQ everywhere you looked. Maybe that's why it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to BBQ. This place does it. Every single bite was a morsel of deliciousness, an explosion of flavors. Wee can't wait to go back and try a couple other sandwiches.</text>

The smell alone is worth the price of admission. Besides having super cool lighting it's in a giant shared space in the Vintage building and feels like the wild west with up-to-date modern delicious flavors. The coleslaw Royale is not to be missed, that's thankfully, this is one place that realizes sugar does not belong in coleslaw. I love everything about the place< /text>

<Review>Really wanted to try the brisket, but by 6:30 they were already out. Got the ribs instead and baked beans. Beans were good, super spicy, not sure if most people can handle it that hot. Ribs seemed undercooked and had good flavor, but I really had to knaw on them to get the meat off.  Certainly weren't fall off the bone. BBQ sauce on the side was ice cold and the ribs were better without it. I think it was overpriced.  $17 for 4 small ribs, some beans, and a can of soda. I was left underwhelmed and really cant see myself going back.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Had to check it out and it's another Gem of the Burbs. The Smok'd Pig was really insanely delicious. Pulled Pork 🐷 , Beans, Mac n Cheese, and  Blue Cheese Bacon Coleslaw ALL on Point. Kevin and the Boys did an excellent job informing us of the options and taste testing sauces made it Easy for me SWEET FIRE is Straight 🔥. No Brain'r Good Grub 😎🍻👊</Text>

Quite literally the best bbq and gourmet sandwich shop in Uptown San Diego! You get a choice of a wide variety of gourmet, hearty sandwiches that are made with serious TLC. My favorite sides are their Cornbread and Mac-n-Cheese and my favorite sandwich is the Cubano!< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>In California, it is rare to find BBQ. Even more rare is to come across real BBQ. This place is the real deal. The pork is likely cooked for over 24 hours in their pit out front, maybe more like 30. It's done just right. Not too dry. It is not over seasoned. The vinegar sauce is exactly what it is supposed to be. Pickles: home made. Right next to a liquor store with a wide variety of awesome beers. I'm going to have a very hard time walking by this place without stopping in!! Next time, I'm gonna order some sides too, this was just a trial run.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

What an awesome restaurant! I had the pork and brisket plate with south west coleslaw. The meat was nice and juicy and the sauce complimented the meat, rather than mask the taste. Not only was the food food, but it only cost me $12 for a two meat plate- why even bother with chipotle at that price? Very friendly service, too.< /text>

The smoker up front in the parking lot isn't just for show! They're using that thing, smoking their meats, serving lemonade, and putting out home made BBQ sauces! I got ribs, and they were phenomenal. Mine and my daughter's fingers smelled like ribs through the next day, and we just kept putting our hands to our noses to remind us. This isn't a fancy place - this is a BBQ spot - and everything is perfect.<//review>

<review>Quiet out of the way place, there's usually not a wait whenever I go. I had the KC pulled pork sandwich. It was great but being a sandwich you shouldn't keep it for too long if you don't want to eat it in one sitting. They are a pretty good size sandwich. They have an option of sides which I have yet to try but looked decent , the Mac and cheese variations being the most requested as I sat and ate. Overall a good experience< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

This inconspicuous place is one of my absolute favorite BBQ in San Diego.  Having lived in North Carolina for four years, I have very high standards when it comes to BBQ, especially when it comes to pork.

While a few other BBQ joints have standout briskets such as Grand Ole BBQ or Coop's, none of those places come close to touching The Smok'd Hog's pulled pork.  The pulled pork here is smoked to perfection, lightly smoke kissed and tender without the slightly stinky smell that pork can sometimes have.  This type of pulled pork is exactly what you might have in North Carolina--it's perfect in a sandwich, and also perfect on its own in a plate.

They also have a great selection of BBQ sauces to go with their meats and on the pulled pork sandwich.  I can't speak to the authenticity of the NC sauce, but even in NC itself, there is a variety of different sauces as well, and to be honest the most famous east Carolina sauce is probably way too much vinegar for anyone who is not a native from there.  The other sauces here are good, and with the large selection I'm sure there's one to fit each person's tastes.

In addition to the pork, the pulled chicken is very good as well.  It's smokey and not too dry.  It's also pulled, which distinguishes it from the BBQ chicken at some other places.  After having it in the sandwich with the Alabama white sauce, I had to order an extra half pound of it to go to eat it at home later!

The Cubano here is also quite delicious and has great flavors.  The collard greens have a good meat flavor with a touch of bitterness for balance, and the mac and cheese here has a cheesy texture and good taste without being overly heavy or salty.

Overall, if I lived closer to this place, I'd probably eat it every week.  If you like pulled pork, there is no place in San Diego better than here!<//text>

A triumph in smoked meats.  If you're visiting San Diego, you'll probably go to the zoo or Balboa Park.  This puts you in close proximity to some of the best smoked meats & sandwiches around.  Located just beyond the north entry to the park is a small red building on a corner with a smoker out front.  You'll drive past it if you're not looking....and that'd be a huge mistake.  While the lot is very small, find a place to park & step inside the screen door.  What meets your eye isn't pretty but the smells that fill your nose more than make up for it.  In a 5 day visit, I ate at the Smok'd Hog twice (& would have been a 3rd if not for bad traffic our last day).  The first visit, I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a sweet-heat sauce.  Pulled pork is fairly easy but often underwhelms...but not at the Smok'd Hog.  It was undoubtedly the best I've had.  My wife stole a piece & was hooked.  She wanted one for herself, which setup a return visit a couple of days later.  In that visit, I had a rib meat sandwich, which was also a treat.  The prices are very reasonable & the staff is terrific.  My calendar has been reset from Gregorian to "how many days ago I ate at The Smok'd Hog."  It's been 10 days, by the way, the longest 10 days of my life.
They're 1,000 miles away from my home city & I fear they've ruined smoked meats for me forever.  Was it worth it?  You're damn right is was!< /Review>

Pulled pork was just ok. "Pulled chicken" wasn't. Not sure the chicken was even done. Sauces (Alabama white and Carolina gold) were average. Sides were excellent. Slaw Royale and potato salad.<//Text>

<Text>Oh my goodness this place was amazing! Wanted to grab some lunch before our day at the zoo,  so we stopped here. I got a pulled pork and mac n cheese bread bowl and ate it like a sandwich. It was so delicious! The staff was very friendly and even offered me milk because I can't handle any heat. Definitely recommend this place!< /Text>< Pictures>

Food is absolutely amazing! The Cuban from here is the best I have ever had around the country. Also the KC pulled pork sandwich was top notch. Corn bread had a smoke flavor that went great with the pulled pork.</review>

Small little hip place, looks a little sketchy and 'hole in the wall' like from the outside. AMAZING. So impressed. I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich which they were out of turkey so they offered to sub chicken. Still delicious. The chicken had a really tasty smoked flavor. My boyfriend got the Cubano which I tried a few bites (though it was hard to stop), superb! My boyfriend grew up in Florida where he has had authentic Cuban sandwiches and he said this place had the best one he's ever had. Their sweet tea tastes freshly home brewed and possibly sweetened with agave or honey, super yummy. Definitely recommend!<//text>

Hole in the wall, no air conditioning , sticky tables, only a couple of tables, expensive but large portions almost make it worthwhile. $3 for potato salad side, good but $3!. BBQ was good, not amazing, sauces good but only 3 types. VERY slow. Overall ok and no significant complaints but I wouldn't go back.</review>

Stopped by right before closing on a weekday. Always see their smoker outside and you can smell how good it is. Got a pulled pork sandwich which might have looked disappointing but ended up being delicious with every bite. Highly recommend it if you're looking for a local joint to get your BBQ kick.<//text>

<review>First time here and the food was great. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, the portion was generous. I would definitely recommend you give this place a try, but get there early before they run out of food because they were out of several things on the menu by 7:30 pm.< /review>< Pics>

Dome of the best beans and pulled pork I have had in San Diego. The corn bread was outstanding. The chicken  was good but the pork was so much better. The reason 4 not 5 stars<//Text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>I gave 2 stars cause of their greens. Liked the corn bread. After getting 2 blocks away; I looked in the bag to check the order, and it was completely the wrong order. We went back to get our correct order; after 15 additional minutes our order was brought out to us. I check the order there and wrong again. My husband then took his boxed hot link in again to be made to the sandwich he originally ordered, 15 min later, he went in just to get his sandwich that was made with a hamburg bun. NEVER WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.<//review>< pics>

Food is very good, well cooked flavored with just the right amount of smoke flavor in the meat.. Really good barbecue saucees. But  not enough meat and options to enjoy the flavors and sauces on. Only  able to order sandwiches with small amounts of meat and   side orders<//Review>

I only visited this eatery because of the Yelp and the readers review.. They may have been paid for the star ratings because I did not find it as being a 3.5 or a 4. starred rating out of 5 stars as listed.
My friend and I both had the Plate special.  Pulled Pork , Cornbread + 1 side $16.00. drinks extra. The total dollar spent $39.00 plus $6.00 tip $45.00.   I would have enjoyed Jack in the Box more..
The table tops were sticky, the paper plates, with plastic Knife, fork, and drinking glass. The napkins was the superior choice here at least.
The Pulled Pork , sides and cornbread were served in cardboard containers each. (my Mac and cheese side was extremely dry and the cheese was so overcooked. My friends chose the Cole Slaw, the cabbage was nice however the dressing not so good. (I always that that Best food mayonnaise had some flavor) so they may have chosen a lessor quality. Both of our pulled pork selection had enough oil (grease would be a better chose of words)floated in the cardboard container.
When served at the sticky table, the server/cashier pointed out the different types of BBQ sauces displayed on the table, The containers looked  as thought they had not been cleaned for months,  the actual opening of the containers displayed a half inch of dried contents. Very nasty.  I can not say that the beverages complimented the meal. at least the names enticed the idea of have one.
I would bet the neither of the two people had a required Food Handlers care, or attended a required food preparation and safety class, in person or on line!
Now on the other hand, As being a retired Restaurant owner of two, I can see this place could have a lot of potential hot spot for it's neighborhood location.. I would concentrate on Carry Out for now with Dine In when their act is together including cleaning the serving area and sauce containers.</review>

<Text>The food is great. THE SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. David (at least that what he said his name is. He has a beard and moustache), the cashier/counterperson, was verbally abusive and kept throwing f-bombs and calling me an a-hole because I kindly asked him for my refill of lemonade, which I had paid for. He said he was too busy to make more. I told him the time you're wasting telling me you're too busy could be time better spent making my lemonade. He said, "I'm too busy helping other customers!" I responded, nicely, "Well, I'm a customer, too. I'm only asking for what you charged me for." He yelled at me, "Oh, you think you are more important than ALL these other customers, you a-hole. Get the f-bomb out of here!!!"

I'd recommend NO ONE spend their money, here. Go somewhere else....< /Text>< resp>

The Philly is the best Philly, in or outside of Philadelphia, I don't care how sunny it is.

My kids would gladly eat the mac & cheese for every meal for the rest of their lives. The dudes that own the place nicknamed my older kid "Mac man".<//review>

I ordered a brisket sandwich& mac n cheese also a pulled pork sandwich. Whwn i got my order it was wrong. They gave me a bowl of pulled pork 2 orders of mac n cheese. They ran out of brisket o yes gave me a order of corn bread. When I went to correct the order I decided to order a hot link sandwich add a bread bowl with chicken. That order was also mistaken 20 minutes later. Third attempt they gave me a hamburger bun with hot links and the food we did order was cold. Not happy not happy at all. If you do go in check your order before you leave cuz all you going to get is oops my bad.<//text>

The staff was friendly, but was playing music quite loud so it was a bit distracting.  The pork belly tacos were absolutely delicious.  I got a side of sweet potatoes and WOW...incredibly tasty!  They are mashed with some maple syrup, almonds, cream and a few spices.  I could have just had that for lunch.  I will definitely go back, but next time probably carry out.< /review>< pictures>

Saw the smoker outside and knew we had to stop in. Absolutely delicious. Expected there to be a wait because it was a small place that was smoking their own meat right out in front but there was only one other group in there when we went in.  If I wasnt here on vacation this would no doubt be a regular spot of mine.<//text>

This place is the real deal you guys! It is a no frills AMAZING BBQ joint. I personally would recommend grabbing some of the best food you have ever eaten and heading home with your partner to devour sed meal and then be instantly inspired to share your intense emotion experience with each other's bodies ... Or will you be excessively full and not in the mood ...? Idk stop trying to make this more complicated than it needs to be THIS FOOD IS AMAZING!!!< /Review>

Truly terrible. I live next door and wanted it to be good.  I gave it more than a fair number of tries to fix issues.  Instead I got food poisoning, moldy bread, and told to “F off”.< /Text>

The menu has always been delicious, consistent, and served by friendly staff. Lately however the food seems to have changed and not for the better. The grilled cheese sandwich is advertised as having a bacon jam on it has no jam, but instead very thick, hard to chew bacon chunks. the same can be said about the Slaw Royale that usually has bacon bits and Bleu cheese in it but instead came with what looks like a slice of bacon cut into two 4 pieces and  some Bleu cheese crumbs. The Turkey sandwich was very dry and had barely any condiments on it at all. But to top it all off the friendly service that I have encountered before from numerous different women and men working there was no longer to be found. Just expressionless faces on the two guys that I see working there now who I always try to be friendly with but instead met with crass cold attitudes, multiple times. It's rather unwelcoming atmosphere with that in mind, even my friend last time we went to pick up an order pointed out. However, the man I've been seeing there every now and then since day one, who I assume is the owner, has  always been kind and welcoming. I'm not sure what's happened here but all I know is it's not the same place that I gave a 5 star review before.</Review><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

Had the Smoked Chicken Pesto sandwich....only OK....smoked chicken was WAY over-smoked, pesto and anything else may well have not been there, almost impossible to wash the smoke smell out of my hands.  Pretty pricey for BBQ, particularly the sides  (which will feed 2 or 3 - but you don't know that until you've gotten your order)  and $3-4 for a drink add up to an expensive lunch.<//Text>

Their pulled pork is some of the best I’ve ever had. It’s so juicy and fatty and flavorfully delicious. Went today and was offered Georgia bbq sauce and wow! Its main ingredients are apple cider vinegar, mustard, and ketchup! So it’s got the vinegary, mustardy, and a bit of a sweetness/spicy element. Love tasting new to me things. Thanks for the great pork, sides, and Georgia bbq sauce intro. I’ll definitely be back!

Have had their ribs before and prefer the pulled pork. Did not care for their sauce on the ribs as it’s too sweet for me, and I like a rib with meat falling off the bone.

Brisket is 👌< /Review>< pics>

the make fried chicken on fridays. i doublechecked during the week, if/when they had it : “all day and night friday, anytime after we open”. i planned around it, arrived at 5:30 and she announced “its gone.”. no sorry, no explanation. service has always been sketchy here, but now theyve lost me.

post-owner response : i guess id call accusing a dissatisfied customer of bad behavior sketchy. yeah, i would.<//text>

This place was dirty. The walls were painted white, but the tresh holds around the doors and windows at elbow level were black with greese and dirt. The condiments on the table were sticky and dirty, as was the tray that was provided to us so proudly by the server, with the different varieties of BBQ sause. The plastic BBQ sauces were again sticky, dirty, and had petrified sause caked around the spout. Yuck! I could have overlooked this dirty, sticky mess if the food was good, but it is fair at best. Go to someplace else if you want good BBQ.<//text>

Great guys and great southern Louisiana bbq. If you like hot sauce they also have a killer sauce called Don Schorcho.< /Text>

Not sure what I just got served but it was not a Philly cheese steak. Looked more like a turd rolled up in toilet paper.< /Text>

You don't have to take my word for it. You can show up at lunchtime and smell how good the BBQ pulled pork is as they smoke it on the grill out front.</review>

<text>I just moved here and on their website it states they close at 6pm. Once I arrived the door was unlocked I even grabbed a cart and looked around, but i overhead a lady upfront yelling out we’re  closed and asking other customers if they’re purchasing something if not they’re closed and has been “insert however long they were closed”. If they were closed they should’ve had someone at the door to let incoming customers know. The lady was so rude about it. Once I knew they were closed I immediately put my cart back and left and it was only 5:10pm. Literally 10 minutes after they closed (5:00pm).</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Great variety of styles, brands, and sizes. The store is HUGE....BUT... Not very well organized, however, so plan your visit accordingly to have enough time to look around.
I have never come here without finding something that I like.
Prices are very, ver reasonable...unlike some OTHER thrift stores. (I'm looking at you, Goodwill)
Staff is helpful and friendly.
Definitely my favorite thrift store in Oceanside< /text>

I find at least one thing sometimes more each trip. It's looks disorganized but they have some really good buys and the employees are very friendly. Browse to your heart's content.< /Text>

It was really crowded and messy in the store today. We had to wait for about 15 minutes to get rung up because for most of that time they only had one cashier. I won't go on a Sunday again.</Review>

<Text>Oh DAV is one of my favorite thrift stores to shop at the girls are great people are courteous they have a lot of different items for sale clothes electronics furniture shoes accessories and they're open pretty long hours until 5:30 which is kind of cool Monday through Sunday will not send it till 5:30 probably 5:00 but I just find a large assortment of different items all the time I love going there probably three times a week and I would suggest what I call therapy if you need to get out and get away and go to the DAV it's definitely a good therapy trip<//Text><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x80dc6e1d329636cf:0x634ab5f8def76f3b</Gmap_id><response>None</response><Date>1612679506487</Date><name>DEBORAH CASON</name></record></dataset><record>

My experience is delivering items there. Fast, efficient and safe. People should remember that this is not a junk yard. Saw them rightfully refuse a dresser because the base was broken. Please, items you bring there are for reuse. On the plus side, saw 4 wheelchairs which looked in excellent condition being delivered.</text>

As it is, I enjoy traveling to Oceanside, CA. as it is, and the first place I know I'm heading for is D.A.V.!!! You can find awesome stuff here. The prices are a little bit too pricey; however, but besides that you'll experience some excitement and fun. Enjoy!!!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Had several large furniture  items to donate. The truck showed up on-time and the staff were professional and very friendly. Phyllis, who coordinated the schedule was very accommodating and went the extra mile to help.
Great organization! Highly recommend DAV!<//text>

Fair prices and great selection of items. Lots of parking. Great customer service (most of the time). It might need more volunteers to keep the store more organized and less unconsidered customer.< /Review>

Loved the prices in here but you can’t try on clothes so its a gamble. Clothes are like $3, and I think either all or a percentage goes to disabled vets. Good cause!</Text>

It's a  fun place to shop for quirky stuff. The pricing surprises me sometimes the prices are a few dollars off of a new item. I understand business economics

Over-priced. Depressing & dreary. If you're looking for deals on furniture or household goods, this isn't the place. Used items are priced as if they are brand new!! Including items you can buy at the dollar store new! RIDICULOUS. Clothing is more reasonable, but no dressing room. Brother Benos is the best thrift store in Oceanside<//text>

Large selection of clothing, shoes, furniture, books, toys, electronics and household goods. Prices vary. There isn't a dressing room, which makes it difficult to pick out clothing and has stopped me from buying some. Staff is always friendly and polite.< /text>

<text>It is funny reading these reviews the rip on DAV for not giving their stuff away.  I make a good income reselling out of theift stores, and I agree that many of their prices are high, but good deals slip through, but you have to be there twice a day.

I just bought a pair of Bozak 4000A speakers for less than 300 bucks after getting my 20% veterans discount, their original price was 1200 bucks.  Yes, they will deal.

Quit yer whining people.</text>< Pictures>

One of my favorite places in north county.The DAV is a thrift store that donates their profits to various military and veteran's programs.San Deigo being a big military town we take pride in the fact that we honor care and support our military both active and retired .The DAV provides a wide range of useful products for low prices .All of there merchandice is in good condition of quality and of a vintage type of style.Anything you may need for a house or personally you will find here.<//text>

Too expensive for secondhand clothing. Come on. A new shirt is literally $15 or more like if it's Michael Kors. But you will find some good clothing. Beat up, faded, torn shoes are literally $30. And people will still buy it and get ripped off. You can probably find identical items for a better condition, cheaper price at another department store like kohl's, Walmart, Sears, etc.
Some Workers are always talking instead of working and helping customers when they're supposed to.
TERRIBLE Management. Horrible, unprofessional, rude manager and supervisors maybe with the exception of 2. Corporate doesn't care if you get bad customer service.
Also, every time  I come, there are always new workers which should tell you something. At the front register, the glass is so scratched you can barely see the jewelry they have there. Messy store too. Store always smells because homeless people come in smelling like body odor
Store needs new look.
And that's my two cents.</text>

very poor experiance. attempted to donate furniture to this "charity". Furniture was destroyed immediatly by a**hole staff members. absolute waste of time and not something i'm going to repeat. I suggest that you visit the Goodwill, or The Brother Benno Foundation on Mission Ave. instead. would give ZERO STARS if I could< /Review>

<Text>This store is a disgrace I can't believe veteran families and veteran supporters come and donate here without knowing that the people who run the DAV are crooks who rip people off. First of all everything in the store is donated which means that they got it absolutely FREE!!!! and the DAV resells it like it's brand new. The managers and supervisor's are the biggest crooks they overprice everything to the extreme ive seen them price a living room set for $6,500 REALLY!!!! you can a find new one at a reputable furniture store for a lower price I've also seen pair's of USED NIKES for $35 FOR GOD'S SAKE I've seen Nike shoes at garage sales for $5. When I say they overprice everything I mean everything from furniture housewares appliances clothing shoes EVERYTHING is overpriced its ridiculous how they price the things they get for free they are taking advantage of the people who donate here people shouldn't even donate here at all. Bottom line is if you're looking for second hand goods don't come here
YOU'RE GETTING RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

< Review>
Ordered here by accident we actually meant to get Yan's China Bistro in Walnut Creek. We were hopeful though, because we live near here now, but we will definitely not be going here again.

The pork chow mein was tasteless and overly greasy, the kung pao chicken was inedible (the pieces of chicken were full of gristle and tasted off). The salt and pepper calamari was okay; I'd eat it.
My spouse was unwell the next morning also. I didn't eat much so I was okay.</Review>

Very good food and service. I had the Salt and Pepper fish and special fried rice. Both were large portions and very good taste. The spice can be adjusted per dish and was done well.</review>

👍 love the food. Every dish has a flavor of its own. Wheelchair accessible. Quiet quaint can talk. Looking for takeout Primo. The food is plentiful and the price is just right. Plenty of parking but most of all. De   Licious🥢🍶< /review>

Spent $36 buck for two entries and a combo egg roll, crab rag,etc. Food taste horrible. The Honey Walnut chicken taste like cake icing. The spicy beef taste like a burned grill. No napkins or utensils. Vegetables are the best part of my meal. Not worth my money< /Text>

<Text>food was still piping hot when I got it! Only took 45 minutes to get here :) very nice delivery man! The prices were very affordable and they packed the containers full of  food. I see older reviews were not good but they have definitely shaped things up. I will definitely be ordering from them again.<//Text>< pictures>

Me and the two roommates ordered via grubhub from here.  They've lived here 8+ years and me about 1.5 years.  1st time experience.  Everything was really good expect the "Scallop with Hot Spicy Garlic Sauce
$14.75 Hot and spicy dish".  There was nothing "hot and spicy" about the dish.  Indeed the 2 rommies, neither of whom can handle spice, tasted it and confirmed that it was sweet and there was nothing spicy about it.

No big deal.  I've worked in food virtually all my life.  Mistakes happen.

Imagine my surprise when I called the restaurant and I was told, after some hemming and hawing, that their "hot spicy" garlic sauce was very sweet.  Furthermore there was nothing that could be done.

Well, yes there could have been more done on the restaurant's part like, truth in advertising,  an offer to remake the dish...........I don't know, maybe just a simple apology.

They came SO close to having 3 regular customers tonight.

It was blown over something that could have easily been remedied.....if they had just tried.<//review>

I ordered for takeout from a hotel, and recieved no utensils or napkins (although I did request them), and a warm can of soda. The green salad was warm, and the cashew chicken just didn't taste right. The experience was disappointing.<//text>

2 hours for food delivery? I would understand if Yan's Garden was a busy place, but they aren't.
This is the third time our food delivery took over an hour and a half. What's worse is that it arrives COLD!!!
No more with you guys. Learn how to manage your restaurant. At this rate, they'll be gone soon.</Review>

<Review>I have previously ordered from them, and while their food was good I was not at all satisfied with their service. I ordered delivery from them 2 times so far, the first time they took just over an hour to deliver and this most recent time it has been close to 2 hours and they have yet to call me or provide me with a status of the update. I have also attempted to call twice without success, first they told me that they were on their way and then 45 minutes later I was told that they were still on their way and that they would call me back and hung up. However, there was no call back number provided, so how would that be possible?

While food mainly a priority when choosing a place to dine, service holds just as much weight if not more. Would like to at least told realistic expectation or at least be contacted if my order is taking much longer then originally expected.

This was my first time since new ownership took over in November of 2015. The food was mostly edible but everything I ordered was definitely a different recipe, thickly cut, overcooked, undercooked and I felt very tired and bloated afterwards and believe me I didn't stuff my face. Took all leftovers and donated them to homeless.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Food is okay, but service ranges from bad to so-so.
One guy in the restaurant will give you a bad service if you are unlucky.
They got my order wrong and blamed me for it. I definately would not recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore.</review>

Most of what you order is not what you brink it will be. It's all the same thing with a slight change. The almond chicken was meat veg with some sauce and they added Some nuts. Pretty disappointed.

The sweet and sour chicken was soggy and they they cut it with tons of raw bell peppers.</review>

The worst Chinese food in ever eaten! Orange chicken is gelatinous and all breading ! Chowmein looks like fat spaghetti bottled and is flavorless.. Everything was bland and of cheap quality... I ordered four items and paid 40.00 and I'm still hungry! So annoyed.. The people rating this must work for the restaurant. There is no way anyone would like this slop!< /text>

Excellent, family run place. They're usually a bit short staffed but they're super nice and extremely hard working. One of my favorite places to get Chinese.<//Review>

My favorite place to grab a bite to eat in southern humboldt. They have big salads and delicious paninis. Not to mention their baked goods! I have to express self control when I go here.<//review>

It’s so nice to have so many gluten free options! Sandwiches, salads, panini, and lots of pastry  options. Stopped here passing through on vacation 3 years ago, and made it a point to come back. Thanks Flavors!!< /review>

I thought the food was pretty good. All of
The food is around $10 for sandwiches that come with a bag of chips. I’ve heard from locals this the best place for coffee and one of the best places to get sandwiches.</Text>

At first, i would have given then three stars for just the pecan and lemon bars. The coffee tasted like hot cocoa. After my review on Facebook one of the staff contacted me and said that maybe in tthe rush they forgot our shots of espresso. Offered to make new, of course we were staying in fort bragg and this shop is in garberville. So, i did have the opportunity to take the up on the offer of a remake. $20 later, atleast the pecan bar was yummy!<//text>

<review>I drink here daily and eat here at least weekly. Because I love the coffee and lust the smoothies! I always enjoy the eclectic music selection of the barista's who (one can tell) enjoy their jobs. Their service is promot, polite and delivered with a smile.< /review>< Rate>

<text>The staff is friendly, the food is good, the area is nice (Garberville really only seems like 2 blocks), but the wait time can be long and it's hit or miss.  Sometimes they're normal, other times you wonder what is happening only to find out they thought it was a to go order and no one ever called your name so you waited for nothing until you said something.  I'd still recommend it, just make sure to keep an eye out for your food.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Coffee great... service lousy... two days in a row.. stood in line 10 minutes only to be skipped and have to person behind me order get food before me.. my cup was sitting on counter... that would be a hint that I was in line to purchase a refill... I say something and get an attitude... not the only place in town thank goodness because I love coffee and good service . So I went back another time... yes I did... only to watch the owner speak to her customers like a Nazi ... stay away...don't support owners who care less about their customers<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Perhaps you need to be a handsome man to get anything other then the dead eyes and few perfunctory words from the peroxide blond behind the counter. I wouldn't know, I'm not a handsome man. Lousy service from all three employees that manned behind the counter and even worse coffee. I went for the latte, it was as chilly and distasteful as the attitude of the staff.<//text>

Every town needs a coffee shop. This one is average at best, mediocre staff and food and everything is highly overpriced.</text>

I guess if you are a girl and are speaking with an accent, even tho you live here, you get very poor service from the blond that used to be pretty overweight. Not sure if shes that insecure or just hates women or thinks that if you speak with an accent  you are a trimmigrant and that gives her the rights to treat you poorly . Guess since she lost her weight she thinks shes a superior human being. Strangely enough, when im with my husband, shes always polite to him, and there is no issue, i guess i should always make sure hes there to get correct service and be served in time and not after 2 poeple that even ordered after me. Dont get me wrong, but coffee isnt such a hard concept. Sweetheart,  you are working in garberville, wake up!<//Text>

July 15, 2014

Great art work on walls!

However, female service personnel is unfriendly, arrogant, seems to be "typical self-centered member of the Millennial generation," (whose Future has been seriously compromised, it is true, by the gangster bankers, by Wall Street, and the anti-social Capitalist corporations). Their helicopter parenting can't and hasn't helped them with overcoming grim, bleak Future.
If Millennials don't want to be retail service personnel, then they shouldn't work in that capacity. And they should direct their bitterness at the right causative agents, who are itemized above.

As Krishnamurti says, they stand to be an unsuccessful generation, because of their inability to approach the grave socio-economic matters confronting them successfully, with a MATURE ATTITUDE.

The $ 2.00 coffee is more expensive than STARBUCKS; but it tastes OK.

Respectfully submitted,

I went in to purchase a new phone for my mother and in my mind I knew how much I was going to spend because I did my research. I went in and Mark immediately asked me how he may assist me. He was able to give me the BEST deal there was and explained everything throughly. He has a lot of energy and I asked him to repeat several things over and he gladly did. He did not make me feel bad for asking questions and re-explained EVERYTHING just to make sure. Everyone there was really nice and welcoming, including Bobby, David, and Brandon. This has been a great experience and I no longer have to drive 2-3 miles to another T-Mobile store.< /Review>

Comparing with my neighbors, T-Mobile is clearly the best data network for my local area.  Visiting the store to add a data line was a most frustrating experience.  When I asked for another of what I already had I was presented with a menu with no explanations.  it took about 20 minutes to land on a plan that was exactly like I had but $9 cheaper a month.  When I asked about forwarding my calls, we try to work it out for a long time and then I was told I can't forward my calls because my phone is a tablet and not a phone.  It acts like a phone I hold it up to my head and make phone calls.  But apparently because it's a tablet I can't forward my calls?  Silly restrictions like that should not be the customer's problem.  Trying to use the T-Mobile app was utterly impossible.  the people behind the counter couldn't get anything more than meaningless errors like our wires are crossed please try again.  I was there for an hour and they gave me misinformation at least every five minutes.  I'm happy with my data plan and I hope I never have to go in there again.  but of course I have to go in there on a different day to try to get my grandfathered plan updated but only on a specific day of the month they can't do it ahead of time because they can't prorate and switch me to a new plan without throwing away part of a month of my service.
Update: T-Mobile responded to this review asking me to send my contact information to them at LosAngelesSouthStoreFeedback@T-Mobile.com and I sent them a polite email that was rejected by the postmaster because they only accept messages from people in their organization or on their whitelist.  Quite funny irony for a company running a data network.</text>

Although, everyone was friendly and helpful, Sonia was the one who attended to my needs. She was extremely helpful and patient throughout the process of looking for a right phone for me. Let me tell you, I am one peculiar person, so I truly appreciated her patience. Now, I am one I’m happy af costumer with my new iPhone 11! So, thank you Sonia!</review>< resp>

Not only did she manage to upgrade me to a new phone with a way better battery life. She also helped me out restoring from my iCloud which brought back ALL MY IMPORTANT INFO. I definitely recommend this spot if you guys want good service, I’ve been to many t mobiles and don’t get so much as a smile. This is definitely my go to spot from now on.</Text>< Pics>

It was so fast, I’m so glad I came in instead of dealing with customer service over the phone.

I recommend everyone to go to this store for all your T-Mobile needs.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1579118788512, 'text': 'Thank you, David Naranjo.'}<//response><GmapID>0x80dd35d0cb843e5d:0xa3295f7b04995a7a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I want to thank Melissa, Clara and Luis for helping my brother with his new phone! They were a great help with setting up his phone and by working as a team, making sure that our great satisfaction was met! T-mobile rocks and that's why my fam and I  have been with them for more then 10 years.

Highly recommend this store to any one because they are mobile experts and have a great vibe! Love the music and how clean they have the store! Thank u guys!< /text>

Was welcomed with a wonderful greeting. Came into the store and got the best customer service from Clara. She gave me a great deal I couldn't pass. Was a metro customer before walking into the store. And am satisfied to be apart of the TMobile family. This store had an amazing environment and would recommend others to come into this location.< /review>

<text>Came to this T-Mobile a couple days ago to upgrade my phone with my mom and as we walked in we were welcomed by everyone working inside the store and the vibe was just warm and welcoming. Melissa the assistant manager approached me first and attended my needs and explained everything in detail as it looked like she was training and showing a new person from what it looked like. She set the right expectations and really paid attention to what kind of phone I was looking for and also gave me the opportunity to see different cases for my phone. As I was looking at the cases for my new iPhone, the manager Brian approached us and made sure his employees were helping his customers out the right way. By far the best T-Mobile store I’ve went to from the assistant manager Melissa to the Manager Brian and his staff. Thanks again T-Mobile, I love my phone.</text>< Time>

This store is by far one of the best ones in Wilmington. Their customer service is by far one of the best. They have all the support team needed to help you with bill issues and device issues. Also feels very welcoming when you walk in, you can feel the good vibes with the store being very clean and professional.<//text>

One of the things I hate the most is going to a place to ask about an item I want and not getting the right help. Well this place is the opposite. Everytime I've gone I have been helped and greeted with enthusiasm. I know the representatives are there to sell but it helps when you get someone that knows what their product is all about. I have been helped by many in this store, but I prefer to get assisted by Mellissa.

I've been coming to this store for years and she's been helpful in so many ways. She won't hesitate to go the extra mile to get things done the right way.

Like everyone else, I carry a lot of personal data on my device. It's not easy to leave my phone with anyone but I have my full trust in Mellissa to protect my data.

Thank you tmobile and thank you Mellissa for always taking care of me and hooking me up</Text>

This Tmobile store is really busy. They provide full attention to the customer they are serving.  Many of their customers pay their bill here rather than on their phones. There is always a wait; However, the staff here is very friendly and helpful.<//Review>

<Review>Switch over from sprint a year ago. New Galaxy S8 had came out and they had a buy one get one free (reimbursed). One year later still waiting on a 2300$ reimbursement. Have got little to no help from 4 different managers in this particular store. Keep in mind that is over the course of a year. Very disappointed.<//Review><user_id>101274828870421476733</user_id><time>1516809459273< /time><GmapID>0x80dd35d0cb843e5d:0xa3295f7b04995a7a<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The staff is super nice and friendly. As a foreigner, she seems know I have no idea how to order. She recommended what is the best, and what kind of bread they provide. in addition, the staff shows me every topping before adding into my bagel. What a comfortable buying experience.

The most important thing is the food is delicious and fresh. Compare to the Ike’s sandwich, I prefer the taste here. It’s seems more healthy.<//review>

I had breakfast here and enjoyed variety of bagels. My favorite is with strawberry flavored cream cheese. Staff was friendly and service was quick. They open quite early in the morning. Nice place to have breakfast.<//Text>

When I first arrived I thought it would be the same as other Bagel Street cafes such as Sunnvale’s or Saratoga’s. However, the menu is really different here, I ordered two sandwiches they did not have which is the case of the Teriyaki Chicken and Hawaiian pizza, also the vegetables they serve on the sandwiches are different and less than the ones in other Bagel Streets.</Review>

Stop by and thought I would get a sandwich for lunch. The service was quick and the staff was polite and helpful. I got a BLT and it was really good. Weather was perfect so I sat outside to enjoy my lunch. The outside area was clean and very nice. I would recommend stopping by to grab breakfast or lunch.< /Text>

My son and I stopped here for a bagel breakfast sandwich and coffee. The sandwich was egg, ham, and cheese and the coffee was hot. The service was good and the price was right. The place was clean and there were definite regulars who frequent this place because the staff knew faces and names.<//text>

Amazing place for breakfast. Excellent variety of bagels with cream cheese or egg and cheese. The banana bread here are just divine. Staff is very friendly. It's marginally costly compared to phillz or Starbucks. But the bagels are just amazing.< /Text>

<Text>This is one of those places where the staff is very helpful and attentive. Where do you feel yours, even if you came alone. Very cozy.
There are promotions all the time, and you can get free cocktails and a private room for an hour. To do this, register on 909gay,com to create a profile and just show it to the administrator. Great guys!< /Text>< Name>

Wonderful place to have fun with friends over the weekend. We haven’t come off for so long. You can get two free cocktails per share and a separate room for an hour. To do this, register on 909gay,com to create a profile and just show it to the administrator. I even unexpectedly turned out so beautifully.<//text>

<review>Always a good time. I might have tried on an off night this time cuz it was really really dead. Hung out for a drink, went walking around the streets and came back, then there was a cover charge, had another drink and still no one around. I've been in the past and it was great fun. Just not this time.<//review>< pics>

Fun gay dive bar in the Soma. Bar up front with a pool table. In the back there is an equal size open air patio with seating. Staff is friendly and drinks are cheap. Draws a 30+ crowd on the scruffy side.< /review>

Cash only, but there is an ATM in house.  There is a great patio here if you smoke or vape.  The bartenders have always been friendly and fast.  The crowd here is also generally laid back and easy going.  A great place for a few drinks, or an evening of fun an conversation.  You can find much more than conversation here, if that's what you're looking for, as well.</Text>

A neighborhood hole in the wall bar (in a good way), that has reasonably priced drinks, friendly staff and friendly patrons. The crowd is mostly gay males, 30+, culturally mixed, though with a small tendency towards caucasian bears. NOTE: the bar is cash only,  they have a cash machine in the back.< /Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>Great place to get your Gay Bar on.  Don't let me chick-like demeanor fool you, this is a boys only bar (typically), I stopped in for a drink with a friend who does the gay bar scene but hadn't been to this one.  It's a good, solid place.  Kinda not jammed up on a Saturday afternoon, but still enough ppl to mingle should you so desire.  Really close to the Stud so if you are there, swing by and check out Lone Star.  I disapprove of the name due to: Texas.  But it's a good place to drink and is pretty mellow.  At least it was on Saturday afternoon maybe 5ish.< /text><UserId.>113525712762256272773<//UserId.><Name>Eleonor England</Name><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

"Bears, Bikers, and Mayhem" has been the slogan of The Lone Star Saloon for decades (although the mayhem is the sort about which everyone says, "Gee! That was fun!"). The new owners (since 2010) have kept all the best features and community outreach going strong, while making several much needed updates to the decor that greatly enhance the atmosphere. It's an easy walk from the Muni station, so well worth a trip on a Sunday afternoon for their infamous beer bust.</text>

< Review>
Went here last night with a few friends of mine. Definitely a fun and unique place. Definitely leans toward the burly bear and cub community. The only place I've been to that gives discounts to short boys! Well drinks came out to only $4 last night, that is unheard of in the city. You can always count on getting drunk for cheap at gay bars. They have a great outdoor patio space too, with bar in the back. Spent most of the night out here, which was perfect with the warm weather. The Stud and the Eagle are nearby too if you're looking for a different scene afterwards.<//Review>

The visual aesthetics from the interior colors to the wooden decor and placement throw my scenes off, to the point where I have to get drunk before I go to the Lone Star Saloon.</review>

This hole on the wall bar is nice. Big screen tv for games. Beer prices are good, beer is cold. Gets packed on weekends but is a nice place to chill with your friends. Free popcorn. They have baskets of free condoms for patrons. Patio has it's own bar as well. Great place to meet new people. One of my fav places in SOMA< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Very welcoming, the whole team is to be congratulated because everyone besides being beautiful is friendly and attentive. The best bar I have ever seen.

(Translated by Google) A good bar with friendly staff and good selection of drinks. It was very quiet when we visited but on a Thursday night.

<Text>Wonderful grounds to walk around on but there are homeless people sleeping and hanging out all day long here. I come here about four times a year with friends and family and have hosted a couple get together/events here. The homeless people sleep under the trees for the shade in the summer and crowd the benches near some of the sculptures. When it rains they sleep under the shelter where the doors are up at the building. On one occasion when I came here with some out-of-town friends a homeless man was bathing himself at the Rock fountain near the trellis and stairs. This is one of the nicest sculpture parks in the area so I keep coming back. It would just be nice if there weren't so many vagrants loitering around and pissing on the trees.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I DO NOT RECOMMEND SHOPPING AT THIS LOCATION!!!!!!! There was one employee who approached my boyfriend and I with a very rude attitude as we were just minding our own business looking at the pop figures. This employee spoke to us as if she was above us and as if she was entitled to something. Then after she literally SKIPPED away. Super rude and childish. Go a couple stores down to Hot Topic. The merchandise is cheaper and the staff is WAY better and friendlier at Hot Topic.<//Text><date>1578048005508</date><name>K D< /name>< userid>

Great store but some of the male staff members are pop Collectors one will discourage you from purchasing.
You will also have a hard finding rare exclusive pops.<//Text>

A really cool store. It's like a mixture of Hot Topic and items that you wouldn't have known existed.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>The menu has been enhanced and the favorites are still on the menu. Fun quick place to dine with family looking for pancakes and breakfast food. Excellent food and service. Had the country fried steak and eggs. Among the best I've had. Restaurant was busy but only waited for about 5-10 minutes. Definitely will be going back.< /Text>< Pictures>

Food is usually good depending on what you get! Steak and tenders taste fresh and location is convenient to my business in a nearby shopping center. No four star because I waited 5 minutes in my car for them and still had to get out and knock at the door to eventually get the order. Manager didn’t care to apologize and told me to call next time.<//text>

My favorite place for breakfast. Love their breakfast sampler, it has two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two ham, two fluffy pancakes and golden hash browns. I ordered take out, it's put in a two layers container, pancakes in top level, the meat and on the bottom. Love their take out pack.
We had tried the rooty tooty fresh n fruity pancakes many times, we tried it with peach topping and blueberries topping, both are delicious, but the portion is too big, after taking in the fluffy 4 pancakes, you are basically too full to eat the other stuffs.< /Text>

<Review>Nice staff and seated quickly.
Order came quickly and waiter asked before food arrived if we wanted hot syrup and more napkins, without us having to ask.
Food was good and coffee was plentiful.
Not too busy for a saturday afternoon, but then again the food is good but not Great.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Open long hours for 7 Days every week, IHOP has not only the traditional pancakes waffles strips of bacon eggs and other breakfast items, but also has Burgers as well! That means this place is great for anytime -Day & Evening.< /Text>

Great place for a good selection of food and big servings.
Quick service most days but Sunday mornings are usually a long wait so be prepared.
Plenty of parking.<//text>

It's an ihop so nothing special about the food. However the service was great! Brought my toddler for funny face pancakes and of course there was a spill. Margarit our server was prompt and attentive and made it a way less stressful instance than it could have been. Will definitely return when I'm not feeling cooking pancakes at home again.</Text>

IHOP was offering a free stack of pancakes today if you donated to a charity. 7am-7pm on all the promotions. This location apparently ended theirs at 2pm. Okay, no biggie. I missed out. Giant posters offering a limited time all you can eat pancakes with the purchase of an omelette. Well that sounds like a great deal. I order the steak omelette. It came out fairly quick and tasted great to me.
The problem is the staff after a promotion. They probably brought more staff in to handle the promo but everyone was beleaguered. My server more so than others. Appeared to rush my initial order and came with my check after I had finished my omelette and pancakes. I had to request more pancakes which surprised him but he agreed to get me another 2. It took awhile which I could understand. It came out great. But that was it. My server did not seem to come down my aisle again or check up on me. Did not get a refill on water once or offered any more of the unlimited pancakes. He unfortunately did not identify himself, turned quickly when I tried to look at his name tag, and was not the server listed on my check.

Can’t say I blame the staff but do yourself a favor and not go in after a promo. The food was still good but everyone looked battle weary and customer service seemed to suffer.</text><Rating>3<//Rating><name>Anthony Loui</name><date>1552444431822< /date></record>

Recently me and my grandmother decided to go back to this IHOP after a few months of not going. They had bad habit of making her breakfast on the cool/cold side by leaving it waiting to be brought. This time was even worse. Except for her tea being hot and her pancakes being warm, her food was already cooled when served with the bacon and eggs.
Even mine  the special cheesecake french toast sausage & eggs combo was off. While the french toast was hot, it barely had the cheesecake on it making me ask if order was correct. They decided not to put much apparently. Then had cold sausage and warm enough hash brown/eggs which needed to be eaten fast to make it passable.
We gave this place many chances in the past and they use to be more efficient at serving the food, now they are not. Just save $ and go to BK or McDonalds nearby for breakfast since the food is actually hot.</review>

They have made a real effort at making it a respectable place.
The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Rarely do you need to wait for something.
The food all tastes good and is a reasonable value for the money.< /review>

Waiters are always pleasant and helpful to us. Comfortable and even little cozy. Food is good. Apparently, you shouldn't expect a Michelin star caviar stuff, but among other IHOPs this is one of those, where I like the food. Put it simply,  my wife, toddler, and I have very pleasant pancake time here. And we're planning to keep enjoying this place.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Wasn't sure what to expect, but basically a fast food restaurant. Was served by a lovely lady who actually gave me what I ordered, but entered it differently and I got more for the same so can't complain! But as with any fast food place, food is quick but a little lacking in taste and goes straight to the waist!< /text>

I wish I caught the name of the host because, he was a one man band and did an outstanding job. Aside from actually cooking the food, he did everything else and had 10 star organizational and time management skills. I got 3 meals to go and after all was said and done,I tipped him 20 dollars. I'm wondering now if I shortchanged him though because, he represented everything that excellent customer service is about. My thanks to him and hope I see him again on my next visit.
Also, the food was very good as well</Review><username>james walsh</username>< time>

Waiter was friendly, food was decent. The area is a bit sketchy though, especially in the wee hours. Guy was sitting inside tweaking on drugs near the cashier when I visited last, and I was harassed by male patrons while attempting to pay for my meal. Extremely uncomfortable experience.</text>

This IHOP is very very clean. The staff is men and women. To get here look for the blue roof or come into the plaza it's across Ross store. The food was super yummy. I informed the places was renovated 5yrs ago and to see the high traffic in here now the place is very nice and clean.</Review>

Food was correct, but service was slow. My glass was empty for 30 minutes and was only refilled as we were about to leave.

As with most IHOPs, expect a wait before being seated if you're going on the weekend.</text>

Crappy food- crappy service. Went for lunch on a Thursday was not very crowded so figured it would be a good day- WRONG! Server rushed my order which resulted in it being wrong (not good either). Asked me what I wanted rather rudely so I left.< /Review>

I became a regular here that they know where I like to sit and pretty much what I order. The service is very nice and the waitress are very kind even the host. Food is always great very consistent as well. Which is what I like. It's a lot better than the one in Union City incase you want to compare and it's more family friendly than the one in Union City. Mornings are always best for me to come during the week not as crowded but hopefully this review doesn't get it to crowed lol kidding. Sundays are always crowed so it says a lot of this place lots of family's come here. So what do I order? Well, over easy eggs pancakes and sausages everyone always the same not like other es where at times its over cooked its old or pancakes take like yesterday's pancakes as for here in newark it's awesome!<//Text>
