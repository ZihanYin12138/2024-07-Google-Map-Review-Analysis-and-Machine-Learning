<review>Nice place to come get a good hair cut. I dont know if there good at all hair styles,  but for a fade pretty good. Also its location is around all types of businesses.  Like Safeway, 99 cent store, 711, chase bank, plant store, basket and Robinson ect.. but check it out your self.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>My hair was cut very professionally with nice chit chat as well. Very pleased with how my hair looked and felt when finished. Will always go back to this location.  Ask for Diana. She is the best. Hands down.<//Review>< Pictures>

I think Great Clips would be fine for a very basic haircut - maybe for a child or man. I went in for a trim and to fix up some of the layers near my face and am not happy with the haircut Diana gave me.</Text>

At home the site showed 0 wait. I drove over, walked in and asked for a cut.   A 20 minute wait, not bad, OK.  She took my name phone number and asked a few more questions.  Hmmm, now a 40 minute wait.  It seems in the 30 seconds she was asking questions the system let 2 or 3 others cut ahead of me.  I was standing right there!!!   Never again at any Great Clips.  Less than 1 star if I could make that work.

Update:  I called the Great Clips customer service number.  They said the shop owner  would call me.  Day #4 and no call.</Review><date>1582563651325</date></record>

<date>1594350821548</date><Rating>5</Rating><text>There are many Great Clips locations, but THIS particular location on Yulupa at Bethards IS THE ONLY Great Clips that my two young sons choose for their haircuts. That is to say, WHENEVER they decide to actually GET A HAIRCUT!

Because, A- they favor various looks, from "high and tight fades"- to the "Macklemore undercut"- to the uber-frustrating "shaggy-look". Not the reggae artist, more like the dude who hangs with Scooby in cartoons. (emphasis on, cartoon)

B- the Yulupa staff keep an impeccably clean and well-stacked facility, are friendly as all get-out, and never seem to be stressed or over-worked. Or, under-staffed. Or, over-booked. If you're a parent, you know what I'm trying to convey.

The best part is C- and D-:

C- the neighboring stores and eateries are top notch. Awesome sushi right next door, the un-ironically Frank Sinatra-esque bar-slash-Italian food semi-dive joint is non stop fun and gossipy! If you're down like that? Taqueria Jalisco has the insane birria on weekends and unparalleled fajitas asada plate on the Hoen-side of town? Trust me, check this location out! Guaranteed, you'll end up spending time and money here ON TOP OF making your kids look they actually have caring parents. Sometimes, mine don't even look like they are truly human beings. I'm thinking, . . . . changelings! That's right. They can't possibly belong to me and my awesome wife? Where's are REAL KIDS?

D- the super-staff at Great Clips/Yulupa actually know and always remember MY NAME TOO! Not just my kids'.

Pros here. Nothing but awesomeness.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1594421550922, 'text': "Thank you for being a loyal Great Clips Customer, Erica! We're always happy to help you and your family!"}< /resp><gmap_id>0x808448f6cddca2b5:0x92196ae8ec08524f< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

One of the worst haircuts I've ever had.  (The worst was in Mexico!) Not only did she cut my hair about 3 inches shorter than we discussed but she assured me she knew how to undercut and she clearly DOES NOT. I'm very upset since I went from long hair to VERY short and had intended to do it in stages. And I took a picture for reference. But she was probably too busy talking about her "lousy" family and her endometriosis to hear anything I had to say. Won't go back there again.<//text>

Honestly if I could give zero stars I would. DO NOT GET A UNIT HERE IF YOU WANT YOUR STUFF STOLEN!!!!!! Clearly this is a pattern at this location. We found out our locker had been broken into. When I tell you this company has no sense of urgency they don’t! It is taking the big boss (not the manager) almost a WEEK to get us the video footage. We had a lot of valuables taken, things we can not replace. Clearly the security system they have in place is either faulty or non existent. This has been such a stressful situation. Again DO NO BOTHER RENTING A UNIT!!! It would be safer under a tarp in your back yard then it would be in this storage facility. (I will come back if anything changes)</text>

<review>I like the couple that is their permantly don't like the coverage couple that takes over they never note nothing in the computer. Also you never have any black couples or Mexican  or Asian,. I wonder are you a equal opportunity employer because I been supporting you a long time and I notice you never hire minorities.  Oh yeah stop putting locks on my storage when its up to date please.

< Review>
I was offered a 10 by 10 to be held for me until today for the 3 month promotional price, i called the facility to make sure it was open and available because I was expecting a call to informed about the unit was available because they had to clear one out. I called around 430, when I did the older gentlemen had no idea what I was talking about so he told me he had to get his wife. He did not put the phone on mute so I could clearly hear what they said and the conversation they exchanged was not polite and was reluctant to get on the phone. She told me they closed at 7. Being a single mother I had to do much packing by myself during the hottest part of the day. I put my 3 child and I  in the vehicle and arrived at 650, I work in the customer service industry so I understand its the end of the day and we all want to go home. But the way I was treated by the elderly couple when I drove up to the gate was not courteous in the least. They locked up and yelled at me they were closed. I was upset due to the heat and I informed her that she said 7 but she cut me off and walked away. Her husband came to my window and repeated it in a rude way they close 10 til 7. I took a moment to beathe since he walked to the front of my truck and scowled at me in an intimidating way to get me to leave. It made my children asked why he was being rude and trying to scare us away. I put my truck in reverse and left. On the google listing it says 7 and she verbally told me over the phone 7 as well. I am entirely upset about how I was treated I just wanted to rent the unit so i had it in my name. I don't even care if there wasnt enough time to put my belongings in until the next day. And the way those two treated me in front of my 3 children was disrespectful, no one like that should work in customer service. I have never had an experience with derrels mini storage like this before, I have never had a unit in my name but my father and sister both have used derrels for many years. I feel very reluctant to ever go back and try to rent a unit at any location due to this experience</Review>

<review>Spreadz is the cleanest, reasonable & best place to do full catering.  The owner & staff were outstanding, accommodating & went above & beyond a normal catering service would do for an event. Spreadz provided tables, chairs, linens, utensils, waitstaff, cleanup, etc. All we had to do was sit down and enjoy our event. The food was the delicious & the set-up was beautiful.  I would highly recommend SpreadZ for any & all events.  The menu selection ranges from sandwiches, pastas to Mediterranean food!! They will customize the menu to your liking. I rate them as 5+ stars.<//review>< Date>

My Reuben wasn't a NY Reuben, but it was a decent sandwich regardless.  I sure didn't need a side or a bag of chips to be full, but they have a good selection of them if you choose.  The pickles they use are a nice compliment to the sandwich.  I wish they'd have given me more pickle on the side, I suppose if I go back I'll ask.< /review>

This place is a tiny bit pricey, but so worth it! Has a great selection of beers and their sandwiches are delicious. The staff is also always very friendly!
I have sat outside on their patio area a lot of times and it is nice and comfortable. Inside there are small TV's where I once watched the Giants win the world series, so there's that.</review>

<text>This place is great. The owner, Mike, is highly involved and actually works there every day. He cares a lot about the food he produces. I actually got to talk with Mike on a “slow day,” only to find he actually has a college degree in restaurant management…. NO WONDER this place is so amazing.

I have always enjoyed the top quality bread, cheese, and meat… finally found out that Mike sources as much as possible from local resources. So, you’re not just supporting Mike and his sandwich shop, but also other local suppliers that enable him to make these great creations!

Help support small business! Get away from chains that use GMO food sources and are all about fat profit! If you’re in the area, you truly cannot go wrong with Spreadz!! If only this place could be open seven days a week, I would come here on the weekend too!

Would give more than five stars if it was possible!</text>< Pictures>

The bread here is great. The meat and cheese is great. The pickles are impressive. The veggies are meh. The prices are steep and everything is a la carta. The constant beeping of ready orders is quite irritating.< /review>

I found Spreadz Deli in Santa Clara on Google Map as a high rated place. Had the "Hot Pastrami." It was definitely a 5-Star deli meal. The customer sitting next to me visiting from Maine was impressed with the clam chowder. I will definitely go back.</review>

Consistent, good sandwiches. Definitely order ahead online if you get the chance, lunch time lines can be long.

Don't forget to ask when you get there for your online order. They keep them in the back and you might not realize your food is ready.</review>

9/9/19: changing to 2 stars and counting. the half avocado cucumber I ordered literally came with 1 tiny piece of avocado and when I requested more the ladies behind the counter pointed to that tiny slice clearly not as surprised as me for paying $11 to get almost no avocado.

First time visiting this place. I took my food to go and when I returned home I discovered they forgot to include my large pasta pesto salad. My BF really wanted that and he’s upset. Double check every order. That’s basic quick service customer service and they fail. I called to let the staff know and the solution offered was to drive another 30 minute round trip for the salad. I would not have made back before they closed and my time is more valuable than that. They took my name and said I could get it next time I was in. There won’t be a next time.</Text>

Prices are on the higher side for a sandwich but still reasonable considering the quality of ingredients that they use. If only I didn't have to wait over 20 minutes for two sandwiches, I would have given them atleast 4 stars. Tip: lunch times can get pretty crazy, I'll try to call in my order next time.<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
This place is located in PS business park (Commerce Park) cross street from NVIDIA new building in walsh ave.
I ordered from them sometimes the grilled chicken sandwich and Caesar salad in lunch time.
The place is packed and hard to find a place to seat from noon to 1pm, because simply it is the only place avaiable in that area to have lunch. The owner is very friendly and nice guy.
the waiting time is not bad during busy time around 10 minutes.
they close after 2:30pm , I went there for a late lunch but I've told they close early, if you want to get your lunch peacefully you have to go around 11:30am.
in general this place is clean and the food is delicious.< /review>

<review>I have never written a review before but must share my experience.  Last year I signed a contract for solar power and the process progressed until it suddenly stopped.  Three months went by without an approval for our system.  I am the patient type who wanted to hang in there with our company but my wife insisted we cancel. I remembered seeing Sullivan's yellow trucks in my neighborhood, saw that they had handled the job at Petco Park, and called.
Alec and Brandon told me the entire job would be done in a week to 10 days.  Interestingly, they proposed locating the panels on a different part of our roof and setting them at an inclined angle for greater efficiency.  The other company never made that suggestion.  Well, I guess promises made and promises kept best describes what happened next.  Our approval came in just 4 days!  The entire work crew was professional and friendly and Alec and Brandon kept us updated each step of the way.  Our system was up and working like a champion in just over a week.  Now it appears our neighbor across the street will be hiring Sullivan Power also.  Call them today- you will be glad you did!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Have had a Sullivan installed system for almost 3 years; about 15K. I am still calling them monthly for the same issues. These guys do not support you after they install, they send less than qualified persons to troubleshoot... Beware and go with a more professional service.<//review>

<Text>Great experience with Sullivan Solar. The panels work as expected, and Rebecca and Brandon were very communicative and supported us through the entire process. We had some issues with the roofing (not Sullivan's fault), but Sullivan made sure everything turned out correct in the end. Rebecca and Brandon made sure we always knew what was happening and were aware of every step of the process. A good experience.<//Text><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

I was extremely careful about choosing whom I should go with for installing Solar Power for my house.

I have been getting quotes for Solar since the last 5 years but always went back for not seeing the need for using that much power generation. Five years ago the first company I got was Sullivan and lots more quotes from others but I really liked the amount of time spent by Sullivan on my roof to get very accurate quotes (Opposed to giving online only inaccurate quotes from Tesla). I was really impressed by the professionalism of Brian for getting so many different variations of quotes (At end I was guilty of not proceeding with Solar for not having immediate need). Out of all of the other companies I was really impressed with the amount of work spent to get proper estimates (Power Generation and quote).  Every time I see an SDGE bill saying I used more electricity than my neighbors and increased my bill, I wanted to switch to Solar and finally I decided to get it this year.

I spoke to my neighbor Justin who got Solar System installed by Sullivan Solar, he told me he did not have to call Sullivan in last 5 years for any reason and he expressed his excellent feelings about Sullivan Solar, I immediately decided to go with Sullivan, so called Sullivan, gave them reference to last quotes I got from Sullivan, David immediately saw me with a wonderful quote based on the information they had and he clearly explained what needs to be done, he explained that my house is Solar ready and he can adjust price to take out any additional modifications. I also asked him to give a quote for EV charger. He again worked with me again to give several quotes and I finally decided to go with Solar and EV charger.

Immediately Peter, who is a project manager showed up to find what needed to be done. I clearly explained him running conduits from the main panel (On the other side of house) to the garage and finalized the project.
The onsite crew (Joe and crew) who did the work was really amazing too, they took all the additional effort to get the conduits right, they answered all the questions I had every point of time.  Really impressed with the on site crew for everything they did and also the Drywall contractor they hired was really amazing.

All in all I am really happy with the work rendered and professionalism from Sullivan.  No wonder they are rated very high and I see that from getting quotes to getting whole work done. You can really count on everything that gets done by them.  This work is not just placing panels on the roof and connecting to a grid, we need to evaluate what the next 25+ years is going to look like.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Sullivan installed solar panels on our roof year ago. They did fantastic job of installation which is saving me lot of money every month. Right from quotation to the post installation check all steps went smoothly. Peter was our sales manager and he did really good job of keeping us up to date and answered all the questions. Total cost was comparable to national and other leading local companies. So far it's working great.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>I was completely satisfied with your service and price. I look primarily at experience, professionalism, and knowledge. Not how low can I sell your job for. That scenario has never worked out for me. Your price was very competitive, no worries there, but your representative came prepared with a Google Earth photo of my roof and where he recommended the panels be placed. I had some suggestions and they were readily accepted. He also came prepared graphs and charts of savings based upon the SDG&E bills I emailed him all in a nice presentation book. The job turned out well, and you even came back and adjusted a row of panels that I wanted to be moved back with no hesitation. That's an example of professionalism. My neighbor was so impressed with your work that she also had you do her home.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Several work colleagues recommended Sullivan Solar Power and this is drove me to go solar as well. This was a great decision. They presented the plan, the options, pros and cons, and guided us through the entire process. They took care of everything for us, answered our questions and followed up regularly. The work was performed in one day to install 12 panels on the roof, and the inverter in the garage. They left the place clean and neat. The crew was also careful with social distancing. After the installation, on the first operating day, we noticed an issue with one piece of equipment that measured the power we were using and they came the next morning to replace it. It's all good now. I strongly recommend them for their ethics and quality of work.<//Review>

I have often recommended Sullivan Solar.  My personal experience was phenomenal.  The entire process was stress-free, well laid out, and exceptionally communicated in terms of what to expect.  Ensuring the company was going to be with me through the longevity of my panel was really important to me and I know that Sullivan will be here for years to come.  The peace of mind and savings made them the most logical choice for me and I'm thrilled to have such a great partner for many years to come!</text>

<text>Sullivan Solar Power has great credentials, leads you competently through the project, and offers an industry-leading warranty. My solar array looks awesome, as does the equipment in the garage, and the battery puts it over the top when we cook and heat/cool with our own electricity in the evening.

I have researched solar power since the year 2000, and this year it finally became financially advantageous to make the move for this energy-sipping tier 1 household. Choosing Sullivan Solar Power from among the many contractors who offer solar installation was easy once I looked at the details and ran the numbers. Looking forward to many years of renewable electricity generated on our roof.
Highly recommended!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Amazing experience start to finish.  Our Solar experience was led by Jaden Holt, not only did he help educate us about Solar energy but helped us understand the way we were currently using municipal power and how our future consumption and billing would happen.  Never felt pressured or pushed on the purchase, Sullivan was there every step of the way and we could not be happier.  Installation was just as good--zero issues or re-work and we were up and running in quick time...  It's now been over 2 years that we've been on solar and haven't paid an electric bill since.  Simply put, Sullivan may not be the only choice in town, but they're certainly the right choice.  I'd recommend them to everyone!</text>

<Text>Our solar project was completed by Sullivan Solar Power in December 2019 with project developer Joshua Daguman and project manager Joshua Craig.  We had an excellent experience with the company from project start to finish and are confident that they will be ready to help us out if we need service on our system in the future.

Some highlights from the project:

* The initial proposal meeting was conducted extremely efficiently and professionally. At this first meeting we received a hard-copy proposal plan complete with full financial analysis of our return on investment and computer rendered images of how the completed project would look.  I felt the project developer was very knowledgeable and honest about the current state of technology and gave good advice about important factors to consider when planing a solar installation.

* An administrative assistant at Sullivan Solar kept on top of the loan process with our lender and helped ensure timely completion of the loan papers.  (Thank you, Samantha!)

* Whenever I called the company with a question about project scheduling or financing, the person that answered the phone was able to answer my question or immediately route me to the person who could.  There was a strong sense of team cooperation.

* The project management for the actual install was top-notch.  Communication before, during, and after the installation was excellent and Sullivan was accommodating to our schedule.  They handled all aspects of permitting and inspection.  The installation team was efficient, hardworking, and polite.  There was a slight issue getting the inverter to come online properly immediately after we received permission-to-operate, but Sullivan had a service engineer out to our home within 24-hours to resolve the issue.

I heartily recommend Sullivan Solar Power for residential solar system design and installation.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1582321682308, 'text': 'Thank you for your thoughtful feedback Jennifer!'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Sullivan Solar Power is setting a good example in the solar market in San Diego and the rest of the country.</Text><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

August 26:   I’m pleased to report that after several months the new manager at Sullivan (Joe)  resolved the concerns expressed below and was very attentive to customer service. I hope that Sullivan is back on track to the quality of performance I initially experienced.

I would appreciate a reply from the owner. This is my third effort to get a response. It seems that positive evaluations have received prompt replies but concerns are not being addressed. I am trying to be patient, but this is not good customer service. Please address my concern.

I previously recommended Sullivan to friends but now have concerns. Why are customers that recently had Sullivan do an installation being sent a letter indicating that a lien is being placed on the equipment due to nonpayment by Sullivan?
I have contacted Sullivan about my referral fee and my calls were not returned after several attempts. When I finally received a call back I was told that the financial department was undergoing changes. Please explain what is going on and the reason for both situations that I have referenced.
************
I posted this a week ago. Still waiting for a response from owner. Please.
************
May  16: It has now been close to two months since I contacted Sullivan about my referral fee. At that time I was told they would get back to me in about a week. I’m still waiting. I thought this was a reputable company when I first purchased my solar. Please explain what is going on to change that.< /text>

<Text>Joshua D was awesome.  Super personable.  He explained everything.  I didn't feel like I was being sold.  You can tell that he knew his company and products are top of the line and that the products sell themselves.  I did my research prior to his visit and he was spot on with the his recommendations, calculations and work ethic.  Even to this day (4 months after install) I still reach out to him for help and he provides me assistance.   Extremely happy with Sullivan solar customer service and highly recommend their services.  Particularly Joshua, he has been so professional, reliable and available.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

You can often determine the quality of a company by the service they provide, 'after the sale'. Thus far, I have been extremely disappointed. One of my inverters went down last year (2019) and it was 'off line' for months. Sullivan never even noticed (so much for monitoring the system). When I tried to reach them to report the problem, no one would call me back. I had to go through the sales department to get someone to answer the phone. Since my system was down for months, I started getting high monthly SDGE electric bills (so it cost me money!).
Now, 10 months later, the same inverted has stopped working, for the same reason (an electrical arc). Again, I have called and completed an on-line service request...4 days and no response. Because my system issue is electrical in nature, you would think they would respond, just for safety reasons, plus again...so much for monitoring! I found the problem, not them. In addition, why has the same problem returned just 10 months later? Finally, it is hot outside, so now when I turn on the air conditioner, IT COST ME MONEY! So, my guess is, allot of the reviews you see are regarding their solar installation process. Most companies are decent when they are selling you something. But monitoring the system and responding to warranty issues is a ONE STAR review.</review>

Do not do business with Sullivan Solar Power.  If I could give them a zero star rating, I would.  They promised to give my neighbor a $500 referral fee and me a $1000 rebate four months after system installation.  I don't know what the magic of four months was, but everyone I had dealt with at Sullivan was so nice, that I didn't think to question it.  Four months came and went and phone call after phone call, emails, texts and excuses from them about "staffing changes" and they still haven't paid me or my neighbor.  The payment was due in early January and it is now mid-May.  I filed a complaint with the BBB and it looks like they finally lost their accreditation as they are no longer BBB rated likely due to multiple complaints.   They are sugar and spice and everything nice by phone and email, that is when they actually respond, but they sure don't live up to their promises.  AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!</text>

<Text>Love our solar from Sullivan, other then trying to get paid for referrals as they promised.  Seems they really don't anticipate any one following up and trying to get they referral payments they promised.  Earlier referrals  took much longer then they said to get paid and required numerous follow ups.  Current ones not sure ever going to get paid.  Your a solid company why promise to pay a customer if they refer new customers that have a solar system installed

Ok. 2/28/2020 Update. Now one of the people I referred has a lien on their house because Sullivan didn't pay a supplier.

<text>Our system was installed by Sullivan in December and now I have a lien on my home.  I paid Sullivan in full.  But Sullivan is going out of business and not paying their bills. I can't close escrow on my home refinance because of them.  All their email addresses have been cancelled.   I have not been getting any calls back from Sullivan.  Check Yelp, NextDoor, and BBB reviews.  Pass the word out that you will get screwed if you use Sullivan.

<Review>We were initially happy with the pre-project orientation, service and post installment meeting. The installation team was excellent! Then like many others in the area, we received a notice of a lien on our property for non payment of suppliers last week. We paid cash for our project and they did not use the funds to pay their suppliers. Our project manager initially followed up after we notified them, but the customer relations contact given will not respond to our numerous inquiries. Separately, we are having technical issues with our system, and no one will followup with us. We have contacted our personal attorney to see what legal recourse we have.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Our experience with the Sullivan Solar Power team was outstanding!

From our initial presentation hosted by Sullivan Solar in Coronado, to our first appointment with Joseph Dale, followed by the installation team headed by Brandon Bojorquez and Matt Faucher, and finally the product operation meeting with Joseph and Taylor Markwith, were all conducted with professionalism, courteousness, attention to detail, and efficiency.  All my phone calls and texts were returned promptly and provided the information I was seeking.

After the final inspection was completed, I talked to the inspector and asked if there were any issues, and his reply was, "We never have any problems with Sullivan".

I had one day when my system was not producing any power according to the SolarEdge app.  I went out to the garage and could not hear the familiar hum of the inverter.  I immediately contacted Joe, and within two hours, he and Brandon had the system back up and producing power.

My system has been up and running for almost 3 weeks now, and each day I am so impressed by the amount of power I am producing to offset our family's consumption.  I am also so glad to be from under SDG&E's soaring rate increase.

If you are considering solar power for your home, I wholeheartedly recommend Sullivan Solar Power.  Their professionalism, integrity, willingness to work with their clients, and follow-up with their clients is exceptional.</Review>

Great personal team headed by Scott Barber giving excellent service to transfer service after a home purchase having solar in the sale. Service call was completed by Jose who labeled the PV breakers and went above and beyond to make sure the electrical panel was up to standards. Scott was customer oriented and left me with the impression that he and the company are out for our best experience and value.</Text>

< Review>
Do not use Sullivan Solar. I used them for 2 projects and the first one was good but on the second one they did no pay the roofers. Next thing you know is that I get a lien on my property and I had to pay $8200 to the roofers for them to start the documentation to give me back control of my home. I am not the only one after researching. They never contacted me nor have the even tried to. Very disappointed and this was even before the pandemic.<//Review>

We decided to install solar after a complete renovation of our home. After getting a few quotes from other solar companies, we decided to go with Sullivan because the Project Developer who came to assess our project, Joshua Daguman, gave us the most professional and thorough presentation. After dealing with other contractors for over a year, I was pleasantly surprised that Sullivan did what they said they were going to do, when they said they were going to do it. Everyone I interacted with was a pleasure to work with and I would not hesitate to recommend Sullivan to anyone considering solar.< /Text>

Great job, all done on time (actually early) and for the exact quoted cost.  Kept us appraised/updated.  For the install they brought in a port-a-potty, didn't play any loud radios, didn't leave any trash behind.  Confirmed with us where to put the solar panels, where to bring the power in through our roof, where to mount the inverter in the garage, where to run the conduits.  We have a metal roof (which dents easily) and the foreman instructed all the workers on how to walk on it.  Very professional team.  Follow-up by Joshua Daguman (Project Developer) was great.< /review>

Sullivan Solar Power employees provide information from start to finish. They provide information at the beginning of the solar installation to inform you every step that will be taken.  The installation of solar panels is completed by friendly, polite and professional engineers.  They contact the City of Chula Vista inspection department and obtain approval from San Diego Gas & Electric before turning on the system.  They also helped me obtain a loan through the Energy Loan Network.< /review>

(Edit 2 months later): Well, that went downhill. The work was great. The workers were fantastic. The sub did great work on the roof. And Sullivan did NOT pay them. So the sub placed a lien on my house (which is their main recourse in CA). After some weeks of emails, phone calls, consulting with an atty, *I* had to broker a deal where *I* paid the sub (again - do you have an extra $5k sitting around?) then after the lien was removed, Sullivan reimbursed me. Can't say I'd recommend this company to anyone after that.
-----------
Sales rep, project mgr, & install workers were all professional and mindful of our needs. The project actually installed one month early. Our roof had to be modified and the sub-contractor they selected did an excellent job, even correcting some items the previous roofer (many years ago) had done wrong. Would definitely choose Sullivan Solar Power again.<//review>

<text>ETA: ten minutes after posting this someone finally emailed me back and canceled the contract! Buyer beware though, that doesn’t change the liens people have on their homes in my neighborhood.

Horrible experience and we haven’t even gotten work done. Since we signed our contract we have had multiple meetings canceled with minutes notice and no return for calls or emails. Trying to cancel our contract so we can get a new company (it’s worth eating the $1000 deposit to have a company we trust do this work) and told we can’t because there is no one to cancel it or accept our letter requesting it.

Have neighbors just get liens on their homes after work is done because sullivan didn’t pay the sub contractors!

<name>June Hamly</name><Review>I have heard about Sullivan Solar for years but hadn't owned a home until recently so hadn't asked for a quote previously. I did attend their big energy independence event last year (photographed here) and was very impressed. It was very informative - I was able to speak with their certified energy practitioners as well as folks at LG Chem about their battery technology which was interesting. Energy storage is somewhat new to me, and I learned why the LG Chem battery is a much better solution than the Powerwall, which Panasonic actually manufactures, not Tesla. I highly recommend anyone considering if solar is right for them to call Sullivan to get an estimate. You will be impressed with their knowledge about solar, energy storage, policy, SDG&E rates, etc.<//Review>< userid>

<review>After several bids Sullivan Solar were the least expensive when I measure price per kilowatt and with a 25 year warinty. However he was also the only one who went on my roof to measure and inspect it and that's what sold me.
The installation team were very professional, knowledgeable and thorough. I'm extremely pleased with the quality of the work. I can be kind of picky but they took the time to do everything like they were working on there own home. I'm very happy I chose Sullivan Solar.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>105205926686979473948<//userid>< gmap_id>

<text>Decent experience with solar install. After 4 months I recieve 2 checks. One was for $1000 incentive in contract and another $500 for a friend that went with them. Deposited the checks and Sullivan put a stop payment. This cost me a $40 charge from by bank. I also recomended them to a neighbor and a co worker. My neighbor had a bad experience and they wont come back to fix problems, so now I'm urging my coworker to break contract before they start.  The worst part is they made my word bad to my neighbor , secondary is the money situation.  Been getting the run around ever since. I believe they are almost going out of business  and now I'm afraid for my warranty.  I should have gone with my first bid from a company that starts with a B and ends with an aker.<//text><time>1601253401550</time>< userid>

<text>We selected Sullivan after a careful review. One of the better decisions made. The planning and installation process was very smooth. Sullivan took care of all of the permits and authorizations to connect to SDG&E. Interacted with Josh Craig and Joe Hamilton and Matt managed the on-site work. Highly professional team who were attentive and always maintained good communication. We are happy with process, the manner and efficiency of the work performed, and the results (including as measured in kWh exported!).<//text><Date>1518471542670< /Date>< name>

Our experience with solar has been great! I would not hesitate to recommend them. From the first day that Joseph Dale came out to survey the project we were impressed with Sullivan's level of professionalism. Joseph asked questions to determine our needs and  presented the information in a clear and concise manner.  He politely, respectfully and professionally answered all of our questions and concerns. We had our solar installed in April 2017 and since that time Joseph Dale has been available and responsive, not at all typical of most companies! The project manager, Derek Mcknight also did a great job in terms of showing up on time and making sure all aspects of the work was done to specification. We are impressed with their professionalism. The people we interacted with who work for Sullivan Solar Power are genuinely positive and proud of their products, service and people!  Highly recommend!< /Text>

Sullivan Solar did an excellent job. Everyone involved was timely,  professional,  and very knowledgeable. We were referred by colleagues from work and Sullivan’s performance far exceeded our already high expectations. Our system is up and running and we are more than satisfied with the results. The folks at Sullivan Solar have earned our highest recommendation.</text>

I will update my rating once someone from Sullivan can call me.

Summary :
A few weeks ago Sullivan sorta finished the instal . Right at the end there was some union strike so that put wrapping up on hold for a couple weeks. Then they wrapped up the work and stated the only thing remaining is for SDGE to give the OK to turn on and we're done, which would be approx 4 days .

Its been weeks and I've been callin , texting trying to get some feedback and I can't get a response even from Sullivan what's going on , why the delay.

IF there is something that's waiting on me I'd LOVE to know, or whatever! No communication means... They have stored work entirely and are not telling anyone as a result of some strike or employee outage, something.

Clearly , I'm not happy so TBD...

Again , if I can JUST get SOMEONE from Sullivan to at least TALK to me with REAL status - great - and IF they can do something about this entire fiasco such as... I dunno... Turning in my Sola ... Then I'll adjust this rating.

Right now I'd obviously not recommend someone that "almost finishes" or refuses to even answer your calls ...</Text>

Wow seamless and professional... Josh and his team did everything they said they would and after 5 bids we were down to two companies. We picked Sullivan because they were very thorough, Josh was the only guy that actually went up on the roof and looked at it while we were in the estimate phase. From big companies to small residential homes they do it all. Thank you Sullivan!!!< /text>

<Review>We just turned on our solar today, and I could not be happier about the entire experience with Sullivan Solar Power. We met with a few other providers in the area, and we decided on Sullivan because of the people, the product, and the reputation. Their reviews online speak for themselves, and my experience lived up to the expectation. Our project developer, Neil, was our first point of contact, and he provided a very thorough and easy-to-follow proposal for our house. He was always available to answer questions and was knowledgable about not only the products, but solar energy in general. From there, we worked with Brandon and Matt during the installation, and they along with the rest of the team, were incredibly professional and efficient. Just a really nice team all around. From signing our contract to being up and running was just over a month, so much faster than expected! (We also have a clay-tile roof which adds another layer of complexity, and it was never an issue.) Sullivan did so much behind the scenes work that made the whole process smooth and easy on our end. I would highly recommend this company!< /Review>< pictures>

Lien on property now. Not paying subcontractors. They got some issues and trying to restructure. Have not received the referral bonus either but don’t care about that. Just wish my $ I paid in full went to the subcontractors. Worried about bankruptcy

Paid off lien. Solar doing great.<//review>

We’re extremely satisfy that we went with Sullivan Solar for our home. We did many research and price comparison and they were the Best option out there. Joshua Daguman was our sales guy he was very professional and explained everything to us very well. He broke everything down to us so there were no surprises. Installation was done quickly and to our expectations. Would definitely recommend them to our friends and family.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>After years of research and recommendations we finally decided on Sullivan based on our neighbor's recommendation as well as their outstanding Yelp reviews. They really had great customer service - we were assigned a project manager who stayed with the project all the way through and handled all the permits, etc. We got a battery as well since there was a rebate through the state of California, which has turned out to be a good thing for our electric bill. We're happy with the results and have recommended them to other friends and co-workers. Zero drama and it just works. Pretty much what I want in a contractor experience!<//text>< pictures>

<review>I recently purchased a solar system from Sullivan Solar.  I researched several reputable suppliers and selected Sullivan Solar.  During my research and down select, I worked with Joe Hamilton, an extremely knowledgeable engineer.  Sullivan Solar's product offers superior performance and warranty.  Joe and the install team delivered the system on time and within budget, and the system is performing very well.
Moreover, they managed the roof repair contractor.  I highly recommend Sullivan Solar due to their knowledge, professionalism, product quality, and honesty and integrity.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Extremely well organized!  No stone left unturned,  all questions anticipated and answered.  All appointments kept and on time!  All work completed on time with perfect clean up!
I made the right choice choosing Sullivan to install my solar system!
Well try getting your $1,000 promotional rebate!  My system went online in December 2018 and it’s June 2019.  After multiple calls ‘the check is in the mail’ was communicated.  Supposedly check was mailed in mid May....June 19th.....no check.
Sure hope if I have problems with my panels that this isn’t an example of their service!
I’ve deducted 2 stars from my original review.<//text>

<username>Natalia Swalnick<//username><text>The project itself was created on time, but we have had two major issues with Sullivan since actually becoming a customer. First, our contract stipulates that we would receive $2,000 cash back within 90 days of the system going live. We're more than 150 days out at this point and still haven't received our check. I'm about to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Second, our system had a breaker trip and Sullivan didn't even catch it! So much for real-time monitoring. I only caught it because I received a $300 utility bill for when the system wasn't working.

Stay away from Sullivan Solar Power. They're great when they are getting you hooked up as a customer but forget about you and owe you money once they have you hooked and under contract.< /text>< Pics>

Just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the event yesterday and how smoothly things went. The battery Q&A was quite useful for me, seeing as I'm about to dip into that experience, so thanks for setting that up in particular. The Sullivan team did an excellent job of putting this on once again and I'm already looking forward to next year's.< /text>

I called several Solar Companies, Sullivan returned my call first and asked me to provide them information from SDG&E so they could calculate how much usage I acquire and what time of the day we use the most electricity, they were the only company to ask for that type of information. Joe Dale was our Project Developer, his communication before he even came to our home was outstanding, he was on time, friendly, knowledgeable, took the time to answer all of our questions and went above and beyond educating us on what we need to know about Sullivan, solar, layout of the panels and what types of questions we should be asking about Sullivan and other Solar companies that we had yet to meet with. We felt like he was honest and genuine. After Joe left we wanted to cancel our appointments with the other Solar Companies because of how Joe represented Sullivan, but thought we should do our due diligence and keep our appointments. After meeting with the other companies our decision to hire Sullivan was even clearer. Throughout the week Joe kept in contact with us, answered even more of our questions and explained the process and took care of all the paperwork.  We really liked what Sullivan represents, and their portfolio of work is impressive but what really sold us was Joe Dale, it really is important to hire the right people to represent your company and if it weren't for Joe, our decision would have been much more difficult. Our project manager was Mason Davis, his communication and follow through was excellent as well. Everyone we encountered at Sullivan was professional and helpful. The entire experience from start to finish was wonderful. I highly recommend Sullivan and wish there were more people like Joe that made the customer experience this stress-free and pleasant. It's now been over 7 months since we had solar installed and we have called and asked Joe many questions ranging from explaining our SDG&E bill, to what kind of charging station he recommends for our new hybrid vehicle and he always goes above and beyond to help us out. Could not be more happy with our decision to go with Sullivan and Joe is our go to guy, he is a class act, outstanding customer service!<//Review>

<review>They could not possibly have been more professional and helpful.  I felt like I was being helped by a concierge service throughout the whole process.  People who just focus on the one-time event/transaction and, therefore install cost, are doing themselves a disservice.  Sullivan's service and support and their management of their power grid is something that will yield results far past the system installation.  I wish they were public so I could buy their stock!</review><user_id>105138947554618344513< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

My system was installed just before year end and I waited a bit to monitor performance and stability before reporting my experience.  From inception to completion, everything was handled professionally.  There was a minor cosmetic issue at the end, after payment and full operations, which was promptly addressed.  I don't hesitate to recommend the company.< /review>

I was very pleased with the service and process of obtaining solar for my house.  The process started and ended with Jayden Holt, the project developer with multiple people in between.  There was some coordination with outside vendors which they seamlessly worked with.  The end product is unobtrusive and functioning as projected.  Although not the most inexpensive company, I chose them because this is all they do and have been in business for a significant period of time.  I feel confident they will be in business, available and willing to respond to problems in the future.  This was most important to me in making my decision of which company to go with.< /Text>

I am very pleased a year after installing solar on my home in El Cajon.  Everything is running efficiently and the home is now up to the 21st Century efficiency.  Everything from initial meeting through the turn-on and monitoring process,  hands-down exceptional.   Quality and expertise count.</text>

We were impressed with every step of the process -- setting an appointment; discussing our options; settling on a design and panel manufacturer; scheduling the installation; meeting with the installation team; working with the installers and then the post-installation review.

Sullivan is a very impressive company. And, what's even more impressive is that we went from an annual electricity bill of over $5,000 to one that is now under $400 -- a savings of over $4,500 per year. We will pay back for our entire installation cost in roughly 7 years -- a full year ahead of schedule.

We have recommended Sullivan Solar to several of our friends. We highly recommend them for their work, their ethics and their service.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

One couldn't ask for better customer service. Their monitoring system lets us know if there is a problem and how we can correct it. The one time we couldn't correct it on ourselves, they were out the next day to fix the problem.  Everyone we have dealt with at Sullivan has been top notch, professional, courteous and knowledgeable.  Five years into solar, we are very happy that we chose Sullivan.  They stay in touch and continue to follow-up even though we paid the system off up front.  We highly recommend them.

I could not be happier going solar with Sullivan.  The experience from start to finish was nothing but professional.  The timeline to complete the entire system was actually faster than what was planned.  All the Project Managers were truly experts and courteous.  As far as solar production, I am really happy with the correct amount of solar producing to what was planned for.  As far as money saved and system pricing I had many quotes and dealt with a few not so trustworthy solar companies and Sullivan was the best all around company.  I am now saving about $150 a month in electricity bills and hope to pay off the system in 3-4 years and then begin to save $400 a month.  All together completely happy with Sullivan.</Text>

We went with Sullivan Solar Power recently. The installers were very respectful, answered all my questions, and the work was completed quickly and with high quality. From the time we decided to move forward with Sullivan until the completion of the project, we were exceedingly happy with the professionalism and work of everyone involved!!!< /text>

<Review>We "went solar" in October of 2010, and have had no problems (or SDG&E bills to pay) since then.  Happy would sum up how we feel.  My son loves to keep an eye on our consumption; we average about twenty percent more than we consume, after eliminating a hot tub and converting almost all lighting to LED.  We have recommended Sullivan to friends and family.  One friend, and my daughter, have installed Sullivan Solar systems, and they are very happy as well.  This company is long-established, and Mr. Sullivan has been a leader and solar advocate for many years.<//Review>< Pictures>

We decided to go solar over 4 years ago. Now, I honestly don't know what life would be like without it. I love not giving all our money to SDG&E, I love knowing we are saving money, I love that we are helping our planet and in turn our children and their children. We did go with Sullivan solar power for our installation. They came and finished our install in one day. They were very educational and helpful during the whole process. Thank you Sullivan Solar!<//Review>

Our experience with Sullivan Solar has been horrible. The project took over a year, I had to call the City and SDG&E myself multiple times, and the worst part is after we paid them, they failed to pay their subcontractors and now we have liens on our property.  No one will respond to us at Sullivan and we have to resort to legal avenues to try to get this resolved.< /text>

Taylor O'Sullivan is the rep. who handled my installation and quickly responded to any questions.  Even on the first day of meeting he was on the roof,  making sure of everything before giving an estimate.  Unlike other companies that just wanted me to sign up and then later hit me up with surprise costs.  Sullivan did their homework and all turned out great.   I'm off the grid and making more electricity than we are using. Even with the air conditioner running all day.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Sullivan Solar is in my opinion your best option for home solar with a personal experience. The sales process with David was a no pressure, detailed and customized experience. We went with solar and the battery.
Then the installation part with Josh at the helm was once again seamless, professional and completed quickly. Then the follow up communication and education with Jayden has been first class. Thank you Sullivan Solar we are excited to be harnessing the sun and ridding ourselves of the SDG&E bill.</text>

<Time>1423265132647< /Time><rate>5</rate><Text>Very satisfied. From initial proposal, follow up, work on location, final inspection, system activation and attention to a minor follow up issue; Sullivan Solar Power exceeded all expectations. I have done many home improvement related projects, some much smaller in scale and I can truly say this was one of the most well managed professional experiences.

I will not hesitate to recommend Sullivan SP to other family, friends and colleagues. I interviewed three companies, all solid recommendations and choose Sullivan SP based on quality of product (not all solar panels are the same), extended warranty, knowledge of project developer and am not disappointed. The project manager delivered the job as promised and ahead of schedule. The follow up by the community developer liaison was a nice touch and made sure that I was completely satisfied.

And oh yes! The system is functioning as promised, delivering pollution free energy and it is a wonderful sensation to see my SDGE meter spin backwards! :)< /Text>< Pictures>

We were truly pleased with Josh and Jayden services.

<Time>1564370671395</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>My nextdoor neighbor had panels installed and I was so impressed with how quiet, efficient and professional the entire team was that I had to learn more.  I ended up talking to the team leader thru my upstairs window for at least 10 minutes, and got the name of their guy who assesses roofs for end-of-lifespan issues; Gabe.  I had never considered seriously going for solar b/c my Carmel Valley roof is now 28 yrs old and I'd been told that companies won't install over an old roof, for obvious reasons.  Gabe immediately had my home up on his laptop and asked for some closeup pics of the roof tiles.  He said he could inspect it and if necessary a roofer could do a "lift-and-lay" if the felt/paper was too worn.  I was so comfortable with Sullivan that when I received their bid (which was inronclad with no change orders during the install) I decided I didn't need another.

In fact, my roof was at end-of life in the S and W-facing areas needed new paper (although never any leaks), but now I have about 1/4-1/3 of my roof essentially replaced, as Sullivan brought in an excellent roofer to replace the paper/felt (what keeps the rain out) where the panels were going (they also powerwashed 28 yrs of mold, soot and even barnacles (!) from the entire roof).  So now I have a new roof where my panels are, and if it fails in other areas I can deal with it without having to disturb the solar array.

Josh Daguman was awesome as the project developer and Derek McKnight as the project manager, as was Eddie and his crew of installers (every one is a licensed electrician).  I couldn't be happier w Sullivan Solar, they are pros and very customer-oriented. Can't recommend them highly enough!!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Sullivan installed our system one year ago.  They designed it to cover all our electrical energy needs for the year and it appears it has done so though we won't get the final bill for another month or so.  Their estimate did not have any hidden costs or fees and was totally honest about all aspects.  All the emplyees were nice even to our dogs.  The system has had no glitches so we have not needed to contact them for follow up but occasionally they will contact us to assure our satisfaction.  I would highly recommend them.<//Text>

<Text>Be aware and stay away from these guys!!!
Sullivan solar is fake and will deceive you every step of the way.  When they want your business, they will call non stop to make a deal.  Afterwards, if there is a problem good luck getting anyone to reply or help.  Sullivan undersized our solar system and signed us up to a wrong rate plan with SDGE.  At true up, our bill came out to be over $1,000.  For 6 months we tried numerous times calling, emailing to get someone to help us resolve this.  Got a full run around with some of their own people even admitting that they designed too small of a system.  They just kept blaming us that we used too much electricity.  When we tried to reach the VP (Quinn) or even Daniel Sullivan, we were constantly pushed back and never heard from them.  After I wrote a negative review on Yelp, all of a sudden Daniel Sullivan finally responded.  Met with me in their office, asking almost pleading that I remove the review and then he will PERSONALLY take care of it.  I did as promised. He then strung me along, delaying and trying to drag things out. Making me gather bunch of useless information for him (water bill?).  I asked him a simple question.  If he thinks the system he designed was accurate, then guarantee that it will cover our usage.  If not, then add few more panels to make sure we break even.  For the last 3 weeks he has not responded to any of my emails.  Terrible customer service.  Unethical, Unprofessional and sorry I signed up with them.  Stay away from Joe Hamilton (sales). Terrible bait and switch sales pitch.  I'm very disappointed and I will discuss this with my lawyer.  False advertising, negligence and deceptive sales tricks.  Will contact BBB. It did not have to be like this.</Text>< Rate>

I had a 5kw system installed by Sullivan solar in December 2013 after comparing 5 different companies. We paid for the system and used the 30% tax credit plus the Califirnia incentive. Throughtout the entire process, sullivan was extremely profesional. The SDG&E inspector who finalize the system said it looked like a utility  installation, very clean. To date we have not paid for any electricity. Highly reccomend Sullivan Solar.< /Text>

Received a letter today, with no sender info - made intentionally to look like a check, from the outside.  Only, it was just advertising spam from Sullivan Solar - like, who in the world opens a letter thinking it's a check (I get checks from various places), finds it's not, and then is like "oh hey, I should totally buy something from this company that was deceptive!"  Did their marketing dept only take marketing 101, and fail even that?</Review>

<review>We just had our panels put in a week ago.  Everything about the process was smooth and professional.  The quality of workmanship is very high and we could not be happier.  Also, it's a lot of fun to watch our meter running backwards.

Solar is a huge commitment with payoff around 6 years without factoring in resale value and 3.5 with resale factored in.  Either way, you do not want to go with an inexperienced installer and inferior equipment.

The equipment Sullivan installed is all top of the line...Sunpower panels and an SMA inverter.  The panels are warrantied for 25 years and the inverter for 20.

Payment can be done either via outright purchase or financing.  We elected to finance based on their favorable terms.  When we do get the 30% federal rebate they'll re amortize the loan if we chose but we'll just pocket the rebate since the interest rate is so low.

I highly recommend getting panels if you think you'll be staying in your home for 4+ years and I highly recommend going with Sullivan for the installation.< /review>< gmapID>

<Review>I am very delighted to recommend Sullivan Solar Power to anyone considering making this investment.  Most of the other companies I considered approached the process as a sales experience where they used price as the differentiator.  At Sullivan I talked directly to enginners that took the time to explain and educate me on the pros and cons of different vendors, equipment, configuration, etc.  Unlike their competitors, there was no negative selling against the competition, price was not used as a means to win my business but rather arming me with the facts so that I understood price is but one component in the buying decision.  I was impressed with the customer service experience, follow up, the installation, and the performance of my system.  Dealing with a local San Diego based business that has good values and an excellent reputation were also factors in my decision.  If you choose Sullivan I think you will be pleased with the result.

<time>1435735694173</time><Review>I decided to contract Sullivan Solar to install solar panels on my roof in June 2013.  I couldn't be happier with the decision.  The project from the beginning to finish was carried out in a very professional manner by the entire team.  There's no point repeating what others say about the benefits of having the solar panels generate electricity for you as it is a well known fact and I am of course very happy with the huge reduction of my electricity bill.  What impresses me even more about Sullivan is their follow up policy to make sure the system works the way it should.  After the completion of the installation, Sullivan continues to monitor my system via the internet.  Twice last year when there was an outage of my internet signal at home, which meant Sullivan was not able to receive my meter reading, I was immediately contacted by a customer service rep to check if the interruption was due to the failure of my system or not.  I was assisted all the way through on the phone of how to check and reset the inverter until the rep was satisfied that the unit was working correctly.

It has been a pleasure dealing with Sullivan.  I would highly recommend them to anybody who is considering solar panel installation.</Review>< username>

I signed the Solar contract on March 16th and got my Solar installation turn on on May 2nd. Sullivan had a company do my roof on April 26th, on April 27th they installed the panels, on April 30th we passed inspection and on May 2 it was turned on. They told me that by June it would be finished but the process was faster than expected. I had 10 different quotes from several solar companies and I went with Sullivan specially, because the project manager Spencer Rosen made me feel at ease with my concerns and worries about spending all of that money on a Solar system. Spencer stay in touch with me all the way and kept me on the loop of what was going on with my Solar project. I give Spencer all of the credit for me signing to do this project with Sullivan and I wanted to give the contract to a San Diego company. Spencer knows what customer service is all about. Thanks to Spencer and all the other guys that worked on my project.</review>

Jayden spent a couple of hours explaining all the Benifits of solar, different kinds of panels, inverters and battery options with my wife and myself. Being a union employee and seeing that they are union was a big plus for us as well. Overall we had a great experience from the initial assessment, installation from the crew and foreman, and finally activating the system. We highly recommend working with Jayden and his team at Sullivan.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

We hired Sullivan to do our solar after receiving quotes from 5 other companies.  We ultimately chose Sullivan for numerous reasons and it wasn't because they were the cheapest.

First, out of all the companies, they were the only one that actually got up on my roof.  Jayden, who is very friendly and does a thorough job, showed up on time and discussed the benefits of solar.  He then grabbed a ladder and said Im going to get on your roof and do some solar analysis with some weird camera thingy that he had.  Now my roof is a good 30' off the ground and slanted but he got right up there and took all kinds of solar pictures to show where the sun hits throughout the day and year.  It was hot up there but he still went.

Finally, he showed me where they can place panels for the best sun exposure all year long.  We discussed the quality of the different panels that they offer, which was something like 10 different brands.  We chose the Panasonic for the name recognition, long life, high output, excellent warranty, and price.

He said they were about 3 months out on scheduling right now.  I explained I was called for a deployment and he said he would see what he could do.  I received a call from the contractor within a week who said he had an opening next week and wanted to know if that was ok.  My panels were installed, hooked up, and running within about 10 days.  Amazing!!!

They always followed up and have done a great job.  Jayden, Melissa, Josh, Chris....great job.  Thanks!! We love our new solar.<//Review>

<Review>We recently went with Sullivan after a not so pleasant experience with Vivint Solar.  Jayden Holt was far and beyond more knowledgeable about solar in general then the other company which made us feel confident in him and Sullivan for such a big home improvement project.  He answered all of our questions thoroughly and even brought up frequent concerns he sees from other clients.  His professionalism and knowledge of the industry made it a no-brainer to go with Sullivan.  Our project manager Josh Craig continued to exceed our expectations and it was a seamless transition from Jayden's part of the process to Josh's.  Josh was always available when I called and kept me updated on the progress of the project through calls and emails.  I never felt out of the loop and for a rookie in the solar game that was very important to me.  Josh and Jayden rock, and we are very happy that we chose Sullivan.</Review>< pictures>

This company has questionable ethics and business practices.  They are clearly committed to lining green in their pockets rather than pursuing a green mission.  They recently had an event at their site for EVs (Electric Vehicles).  They refused, however, to allow Tesla vehicles to participate.  EVs from pretty much every other automotive manufacturer were able to participate in the event.  Is it just a coincidence that Tesla is the only automotive manufacturer that also makes solar products (which compete with what Sullivan sells)?  I think not.  If Sullivan were truly interested in a a green mission, they would have not only welcomed Tesla EVs at their event, they would have gone out of their way to invite Tesla owners to bring their cars to the event.

Sullivan also attempted to strong-arm the EVAoSD (Electric Vehicle Association of San Diego) to force me to remove a similar review from Facebook.  Pathetic tactics!

Shame on Sullivan for caring more about lining their pocketbooks than about the planet that they pretend to protect.

Now, what will happen next is Tara, a representative of Sullivan Solar, will respond to this review and provide a bunch of BS in attempt to morally justify why Tesla vehicles couldn't participate in their event.  What I would be much more impressed by, however, is if Sullivan apologizes for their mistake and owns up to it.  But Sullivan won't do that because that's not the kind of company that Sullivan is.<//text>

<Review>I could write a glowing review covering every phase of my Sullivan Solar project from the initial presentation to completion. The personnel I dealt with, the timeliness of the installation process, and the financial incentives offered by Sullivan, all exceeded my expectations.  Instead, I would like to focus on two areas that I think will help you make the decision to choose Sullivan as your system installer.

First of all, I am the type of person that is reticent to recommend just about anybody for anything! We can all have different experiences, and circumstances can always intervene to upset the outcome of any situation or relationship. Having said that, I can, without hesitation, recommend Sullivan Solar to anyone considering a solar system. If you are shopping around for a system installer, I recommend you speak with several other companies first. They will probably impress you, especially if you are starting out with very little knowledge about these systems, as I was. Do your research. Now you will at least know what questions you should have been asking! Then I would meet with Sullivan. You will see a night and day difference in their presentation. Which leads me to my second point….

I was trying to “see the math” which would dictate the size of system that made the most sense for me considering my power requirements. Where was that break-even point between system size/cost and my tiered SDGE rates? I never got a satisfactory answer from any company except Sullivan. I soon learned that most of these companies do a cookie cutter one-size-fits-all system, and the sales pitch always leads you back to that system. After experiencing this with several other companies, I met with Sullivan and all my questions were either already covered in their presentation, or answered on the spot. Their representative covered several different system size and financing options, all tailored to my specific needs. Talk to the other companies and then give Sullivan a call. Myself, and my friends that I have referred to Sullivan, couldn’t be happier with our Sullivan Solar Power experience.<//Review>< Pics>

I'd like to commend Jayden Holt.  My spouse and I were at the Del Mar home show today and stopped by the Sullivan cubicle.  Jayden was very receptive and polite.  Jayden has a wealth of knowledge that he readily shared.  We were so impressed with how much we learned from Jayden in a span of 15 minutes.  His positive demeanor and welcoming spirit are noteworthy.  Sullivan is lucky to have Jayden representing your company.  Thanks again, Jayden.</text>

I contracted Sullivan to install SunPower PV systems on two properties, a 4.6KW 16 panel system & 6KW 21 panel system.  I'm extremely pleased with Sullivan's professional service, quality of installation and the SunPower systems in general.  I have & will continue to recommend Sullivan Solar to anyone interested in going solar, they're a top notch well run organization.< /review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>We have now had our solar system in operation for 14 months.  Sullivan designed it  to replace our Tier 3 and Tier 4 power with solar power at less than half the price. Their crew which installed the system was courteous and very knowledgable, and did their work without a single problem or inconvenience for us.   The system went online, on time, and as planned and has worked flawlessly ever since.

I have monitored the system on a monthly basis now for over a year and it has outperformed its predicted performance  by about 10-15% in winter, spring, summer, and fall.  My payments to SDGE have been reduced by about 80% (darn those $5 monthly connection fees!)

What more could you ask?  Well Sullivan implemented the system so that we can expand it very easily should SDGE increase their Tier 1 and 2 rates by leaps and bounds in the future.  If history is guide, you can bet your life we'll have Sullivan working for us again in the not-to-distant future!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Very cozy. A little bit pricey. The owner is nice but very aggressive about giving advice on how you should paint your item. She has some good ideas but should hold off unless asked.<//Review>

I love those place! The owners are so nice and personable. We took my mother in law here for her birthday and the owner brought her a cupcake with a candle, so sweet! I love coming here because I get to socialize with the owners and get good tips on painting.<//review>

<Review>I absolutely love the architecture of this place and all the signs are easy to read and you know exactly where the buses and trains are and which platform and what time. We love taking the Pacific Surfliner from here because there is plenty of parking and just all in all bigger space for pick up and drop off zones. Pandemic times have really hit this place hard as far as people traffic goes, but nevertheless they really kept this place clean despite the homeless hanging out in there sometimes.< /Review>< Rate>

The bays are well marked. Well enough that I knew I couldn't find mine, on a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully there was a real human information clerk who explained to me where I needed to be. On a Sunday afternoon, with COVID going on, they still had staff onsite, thank you.</Review>

<Review>This bus station feels like an airport.  Is very lovely on the eyes with it's vaulted high ceilings, spacious lounges, and open airy feel.  It actually makes waiting for a Greyhound a pleasant experience. It's possible Amtrak and Metrolink trains also stop here, but I don't remember.< /Review>< UserId.>

The area is wide open. So there's no problem with getting crowded here. I'd like to put in a word for Danielle, the Greyhound assistant who went out of her way to help me, who was pleasant and mannerly. Thank you!
I believe it's personnel that keeps a business going and so important to the customers.</review>

<text>Better have a smart phone for your greyhound ticket.  No one to help you, tell you the time, light your ciggy, give you an update on bus arrival time. Dark area and very cold too. Uncomfortable chairs because they're afraid a poor homeless person might be able to rest there.<//text>< Rating>

<review>The first few times riding greyhound was a traumatic ordeal. It left blisters and lesions upon my soul and psyche, but over the years these blisters formed a callous that allows me to ride greyhound and feel utterly dead and hopeless​ . Every new greyhound experience  adds to that callous. Soon I'll simply have nothing left to blister :/<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORcD6rOcAy2M5y2uf_wFSHCpGUOnHKdPLyS4Uc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Very clean, efficient, newer, attractive. Trying to figure out destinations for Metrolink is extremely confusing. There's very little information and there's no wall maps like you see in BART or other major cities. I'm not sure how to buy tickets either. I find the biggest concern with people who haven't tried Metrolink yet is the concern they will be dropped off at a station in the middle of nowhere, stranded without having a clue when the next train is going to come. The Artic station could do 10 times as much business with Metrolink if they stopped trying to run it like Amtrak. Congratulations you've found Los Angeles!< /Text>

Parking lot is nice and free bit if you have any extra baggage make sure that you bring cash at twenty dollars per bag. Restrooms are pretty nice.<//text>

Took greyhound to the Phoenix, bus driver got lost between Anaheim and Los Angeles.  Ended up in Long Beach where the 22 ends.  Driver made a u-turn to get back on the 22.  A first for me.  Back of the bus smelled like a restroom.  Unfortunately some of your fellow passengers may be hygiene deficient.  Ride at your peril.  Still a good cheap ride.< /Text>

As my 17yo son was waiting for his bus trip, the bus arrived at 9:27 pm and departed at 9:27 pm, leaving all the passengers stranded. My son was left there with the expectation that he would be safe inside the bus station, then safe on the bus until his destination. After 10 pm, he was forced to find a ride to a place that was much less than ideal, all because of Greyhound's ridiculous excuse for a driver. Customer service was equally a joke. I was told at least 14 times that they could locate the bus but not the passenger. The representative was unable to tell me Greyhound's procedure for how they handle passengers whose bus has left them stranded late at night. The reason for two stars was because the security guard was helpful.< /review>

Ticket said bus departure was at 9.30pm, boarding at 9.10pm. We arrived at 9.10pm on the dot to see 2 buses (not marked in any way as Greyhound buses) pull away before we could get to the bay. After checking the website we could see our bus on the way to LA. I write this hoping against hope we can get on the next bus.

My advice? Avoid greyhound like the plague, and get a more dependable service.< /Review>

Arriving here was fine. Location is great to spend time.
Leaving, they told me the bus was gonna be delayed for HOURS! I didnt want to miss my LA bus so I ended up LYFT-ing with a group of people to LA Bus Station.

They at least gave us a refund.< /review>

<review>So i dont know are people asking if they ought to take greyhound to Los Angeles or are they asking if the Anaheim station is clean or what do people want to know? Well i been taking greyhound for  a long time and  each driver is different. but when you dont have a lot of money and are trying to travel this is usually the way to go unless you can go on Megabus which sometimes has some amazing deals but you have to have a phone to purchase tix with Mega bus. IT does take a longer time to travel by bus but as far as i am concerned its the cheapest way to travel . Sometimes you get a nice group with you on the bus and other times  it can be a little shady. But if you plan ahead either way you get good deals.The Anaheim Arctic station is a nice clean station to my knowledge. However just so you know if you are ever stranded in the Anaheim station they do close at 2am and to my knowledge no one is allowed in the station after 2am even if you have a ticket so plan ahead. Now in DTLA Union station if you have an Amtrak ticket i know you are allowed to stay in the station overnight and or until your Amtrak train -bus arrives. Or if you are metro link  monthly passholder. If you are traveling any other way they wont let you stay in the station until 4am so your stuck outside if you are a metro pass holder which sucks if you dont have a lot of money . Union station has Starbucks subway and a little mini mart and so does the Anaheim Arctic( mini mart)  but no Starbucks in Anaheim station and no subway either. Very pricey i think in Anaheim actually if you want to go to the restaurant upstairs or  the pink berry or mini mart. Greyhound now has outlets to charge phone. if you travel greyhound you should carry snacks as they do not carry. Amtrak has a cafe car unless there is a woops then they close. If you are trying to get into Los Angeles from Anaheim or Orange there are even cheaper ways to get there but it will take you double the time.  OCTA bus 50 to LBT 90's ( ask 4 transfer) to Blue line Metro. or Octa bus 50 or Octa 46 and walk a block north or south depending which line and take METRO 460 to DTLA. OCTA bus 42 to LBT 173 trnsfr MetroGreenLine/Blue line. ALL the best!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I hit a trifecta on the ponies so I decided to come here to see if my system would translate to the pups.

It seems that somebody has built a spaceport where the dog track ought to be.

This station is where my anguish started, this station was actually nice and clean I'm assuming this station is newer than most.  Bus was only 2 minutes late can't say that about the other bus routes. Only one clerk was on duty to help out a line to of customers.</text>

Good place to come golfing, just watch out for the weirdos up the road. Was teeing off with my dad and heard screaming coming from the direction of the Base. Avoid driving up the road past this golf course, taking the 79 or Ramona Blvd is a much better option than potentially getting shot.<//review>

Seemed like they use decent ingredients but the sauce lacked something, maybe a kick, maybe could have used more sauce.<//Text>

The lady ignored me for quite a while before I could order, (not busy). No signs posted about not having change, when I paid cash I received zero change, no explanation. They’re short changing everyone and hoping nobody will mention it. I would have paid with my card if I knew they keep the change. I cannot help but feel annoyed, I don’t like my change stolen from me like that.

Thankfully the food was way better than I expected, and price was a good deal despite be overcharged. Taco Tuesday was a good deal, I want to come back if the food is consistently good.

Temporary outside dining area looks so ugly it makes the whole city look bad, It’s the first eyesore you see when you enter Los Alamitos via Willow.
LOOKS LIKE DISASTER RELIEF TENTS.

Get your act together, stop overcharging and making the city look ugly. Don’t be a disgrace to Cafe Del Soul.< /Text>

We came to this restaurant for a meeting. This spot was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, we were not disappointed. The staff were very polite and we had an excellent feeling. The food was just great. We had a great time and we will visit this place again. Keep it up.< /text>

My husband loved his chicken enchilada plate so much he ate the whole plate before I finished my 1st taco.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<text>Went in on a weekend late morning.  I ordered a taco and chili relleno.  Server informed me they were out of chili rellenos.  My wife ordered blueberry pancakes.  Server returned later to tell her they were out of blueberries and bananas but they did have strawberries.  We overheard someone else ordering an omelette and he was told they were out of mushrooms.  I have never been to a restaurant that was out of so many things.  Pretty disappointing.</text>< rate>

My order was 2 hard tacos a side of rice and beans with a coke and that came out to over 15$. I go to pick up my tacos and every thing falls out the bottom because my hard tacos was soggy on the bottom.  My food was mediocre at best and I wont be returning. If you want good Mexican food you still won't find any in los alamitos.< /Text>

This place is an excellent place if you do a lot of bullion or collect American coins.  While personally, I don't really do that high of a volume of bullion and American, the few times it has come up for me this place has at least been respectful even if we could not come to a deal all the time.  If you're in the West LA/ Santa Monica area, this is a good place to go.</text>

I was offered just $50.00 for a 2 1/2 Indian head 1915 gold coin surrounded with emeralds.  When I said no, the guy (should have asked his name) said he would take a chance 'cuz he didn't know how real the gold was and offered $140.  ????? Huh???? How do you go from $50 to $140 and then when I said no again and told him I was offered $200 a few years ago at the same place, I walked away.  On the internet the prices are all around $300 to $400.<//text>

Unsatisfactory. Chris was a young guy acting like an expert, but, seller beware. I left feeling like I’d been swindled. Specifically, he told be that certain pieces I was selling were not real gold or silver. Pieces that are stamped 14K gold and 925 Silver. He said that a gold and (citrine?) bracelet was not gold, but, he wanted to buy it! I don’t know what he paid for it because the breakdown of the worth of individual items was ignored.
This business may be reputable in other areas, like the other reviews say. But, if you are a Senior Citizen selling coins ( he said my Ancient Greek coins were basically worthless) you must have confirmation of their value first from a source other that Wilshire Coin. I still have a very bad taste in my mouth from selling my scrap gold, silver coins and jewelry there.

<Review>I've hardly ever been motivated to write a review, but my treatment at the store on Dec 24th 2020 has led me to this.  It is with sadness, because I have been buying silver ingots from the store for at least the past 8 years--they are great stocking stuffers.  I was approached by a man, I believe it is Glenn, who asked if he could help.  I said I wanted 1 ounce silver bars and asked how much they were.  When he said they were running about $28/oz, I said I was surprised since last year they were closer to $20/oz.  I guess with Covid and low Fed interest rates, it's clear people are heading towards other investments.  Then, Glenn said "are you questioning me, with over 20 years experience in this business?"  I am not in the business and was simply expressing surprise.  I wanted to be educated.  Then he asked how many bars I wanted.  After 10 seconds of me counting in my head how many to buy, he began clapping his hands and saying "come on sir, let's hurry it up, we've got people waiting" (I was the only person in the line).  After this rudeness I decided not to make the purchase.  Again, it is with much sadness I must discontinue my patronage of this store.</Review>< pics>

<text>These guys are the real deal. Tom is great, he’s the white dude in his 20’s about 5’8” 140 lbs. Good guy. Has taken care of me since day one. Knowledgeable bunch here. Passionate about what they do, and very consistent with their prices, and most importantly their ethics. COVID made it tough for them, and the customers; but they made it work.

Before I tried them out I called up maybe 30 other dealers in LA and their premiums were either ridiculous, or they were supply blocked.< /text>< Pics>

I have been buying and selling to Wilshire Coin for almost ten years now, they are always very professional and their prices for buying and selling are very fair. I sold a couple of gold maple leafs on Friday, and never even had to go inside. Someone was inside already so Glen met me out front and took the coins and returned with the cash within a few minutes! Ask for Glen he’s on it (looks like a famous actor, least that’s what he told me!) Honestly, have dealt with many of their staff and they are all more than happy to give you information about your coins, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Only place in town to buy and sell coins!! Thank you!</Text>

<text>First I would like to thank John. This guy was great. Very honest. This company was great to me. I have zero knowledge in coins. I had inherited a collection of mixed items. I had been in another shop a few weeks earlier and was left with a bad taste. Wilshire Coin was excellent. John spent the time to go through my collection, explain why certain things had no value, and why other things had excellent value. He even told thing about my collection that explained why my dad was a collector. I felt at ease dealing with John. I felt that he was extremely honest and knowledgeable. These guys gave me 20% more then the other place in Torrance. I will definitely only go to Wilshire Coin for anything related to jewelry, coins, gold, silver, platinum etc...... Don't waste your time with any other shop. Just go strait to Wilshire Coin.
And they even have some really cool stuff from the great Houdini himself

AGAIN THANK YOU JOHN!</text>< Rate>

Came in to have items appraised. A younger gentleman was able to assist me in determining the worth of my goods. Very polite and knowledgeable staff was able to assist me greatly! The items in their showroom are pretty interested and also well priced. Would highly recommend this spot over others in the area. The staff at Wilshire at the best!</Review>

<Review>I went in with a heap of metal that I’ve accumulated aver the years. I wasn’t sure what was costume, what was plated, what was real. Justin was so generous with his time helping me sort through everything, telling me exactly what everything was. He even helped to organize my metals and so kindly put them into separate plastic bags. Even though I didn’t have anything of tremendous value I didn’t feel any less than an important customer. They are true professionals.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I inherited some of my aunt's jewelry and coins. I brought them to Wilshire Coin, where the staff couldn't have been friendlier. I had researched the coins and knew the value of the jewelry I was bringing in. Justin, who works there, treated me great and gave me what I thought was an extremely fair deal. I'd definitely go back.</review>

I have zero complaints and nothing but high praise for my experiences with Wilshire Coin. First off, Cris is an awesome young man who provided me with impeccable customer service. I recently inherited a collection of coins, and although I took the bulk of the coins to an Inglewood dealer (out of pure laziness because it was closer to my home). They treated me poorly and paid me unfairly. Cris, on the other hand, spoke to me as if I were selling gold bars rather than a few odds and end coins rejected by the other dealer. He graciously took the time to explain why some coins had more value, than other coins. And in doing so, he was kind, knowledgeable, honest and extremely compassionate. I highly recommend Wilshire Coin Company to anyone in the market of buying or selling gold, silver or coins of anykind.</review>

I had the pleasure of working with Justin Glick and he was so patient, knowledgeable and above fair!  I was impressed with his knowledge combined by fair prices.  I previously had a "well know  Beverly Hills jeweler" tell me several of my diamonds and other gemstone were not real.  HE KNEW THEY were AND offered a very handsome price.  I just brought a handful of my items in and I will return without a doubt with more!  This is your place for knowledge ability and truly fair offers.

<Review>I am yet to find a well priced item there, it shows in the fact that I went 2 months a part once, and the same stuff was sitting in the show room. They pay as little as possible for your stuff. Half the staff are good, and the other are not welcoming, and will trick you into thinking your stuff is worthless. The make it hard to get there, and then they hit you with the ridiculous prices. Would not recommend, over a small shop were they value your time and business.<//Review>< Response>

<Text>They have a professional environment, however with a empty store it definitely doesn't justify poor customer service.

To me if I'm going to pay you money for simply bringing coins out, you can at least act courteous and respectful.

Brian whom I spoke with on the phone was friendly but the person I dealt with in person acted like he was in a rush and had better things to do.

Perhaps it's a intimidation factor to get you to go their way?
Pricing however is solid for acquiring investment grade coins from them.

Good Luck, Hope this helps!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2a4ceaf091dcb:0xb143c0a4205dd083<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have been interested in investing in precious metals, I had done some research online about it but decided to just head over to Willshire coin. The guys there were very friendly and knowledgeable and made the process easy and educational. Justin who works there explained everything and made me feel that he was leading me in the right direction.  He easily offered the lowest premium on precious metals. Basically, I invested in gold and feel good about it. Thank you everyone at Willshire Coin especially Justin!</review>

Working with John Green at Wilshire Coin was an absolute pleasure.
I had come in with two disorganized suitcases full of silver coins and vintage domestic/foreign bills that I had inherited. With professional diligence John was able to sort through what was of value all while pleasantly conversing and discussing his process. I was impressed with John and overall very happy with my experience at Wilshire Coin. Everyone was very kind and knowledgable.
Concluding, I ended up selling most of what was in the two cases and I feel as though a heavy burden has been lifted. Five Stars *****</Text>

<review>I think they are very honest   I went to a place in Beverly Hills  and this place offer me $40.  But discover I left my wallet at home    Went home to get it , then decided to go to  Wiltshire gold  in stead of going all the way back to Beverly hill  and there to my suprise my gold was worth $60.   So that's why I feel they are  honest<//review>< pictures>

I was selling jewelry for the first time and didn't know where I'd get the best deal, so I compared what 3 gold buyers in the Santa Monica/Westside area offered me on a ring and a necklace.  Wilshire Coin Exchange was the first place I visited, and I was in and out with my estimate in 5 minutes.  I spent quite a while driving around getting the quotes (each buyer needed to see and test what they would be buying), but when I had all the information, I ended up back at Wilshire Coin Exchange.  Their estimate beat the other two businesses by $45 dollars or more and the staff couldn't have been nicer.  If I ever have need of similar services again, I now know where to go.< /Text>

Had a issue with the way I was treated on last visit, manager contacted me directly and fixed the problem, immediately.

This is the Wilshire Coin I've always known - everyone treated with respect and courtesy, always have great personalized service - wether they can help  directly or not, always feels good visiting and talking to people I can trust.</text>

<review>If you’re a newbie don’t go here.. they will lowball you for sure. But that’s a part of the game so I ain’t blaming no one but myself. Good thing I have way more than what I sold cus I woulda got jipped cus I’m fairly new. I guess I’m have to start selling on my own. Cool looking store though. Cool collection of coins. Bottom line only sell your junk coins here or anywhere for that matter. Sell your rare coins yourself.. it's a dirty game and the main you need to know is don't let them take advantage of you that control your deal. It's your stuff so you make the deal. They can and will smell any signs of uncertainty. 4 stars still cus I ain't a hater.< /review>< pictures>

I came in asking to purchase pesos.  I was helped by Justin  upon inquiring the cost, I was told 17.90.  I thanked him and turned around to leave. He asked why I wasn't proceeding with the transaction and I politely informed him that 2 days ago I had purchased pesos for 18.40 in the cancún airport.  He then rudely said "why don't you go to mexico then?"   I thanked him and left. I have used this place more than a few times as I am a businessman who frequently travels internationally.   I don't think anyone is deserved to be spoken to this way especially a returning customer.   Thanks Justin for reminding me that there is always a piece of garbage within arms reach.</text>

<Review>Went in today close to closing time to buy an ounce of Silver, the gentleman that helped me was courteous and gave me a recommendation on what I should be purchasing. I'll definitely be back to purchase more from here as I grow my collection.< /Review>< Pics>

I was buzzed in the security door and stood at the counter for seven minutes before anyone came out I could see them behind the tinted window goofing off and they only came out until I said hello real loud then one short fat guy with dark hair said I should wait ten minutes longer because I'm a Broncos fan they sell their 2.50 above spot what a rip off monex sells 1.00 above spot I went in to get 2 by 2 penny flips they wanted 75 cents each for a 5 cent product LMAO they also had a gang member in the lobby doing a dry run who also reeked of weed and did not kick him out</review>

I'm from Los Angeles and I buy Silver to save my money(sounds kinda funny but I have a lot of money now).   I've been to the other coin shops in L.A and there are really 3 of them that are worth going to..  Wilshire Coins is on the top of my list.  Why?
2.70 over spot for SILVER?  that's actually very very good.  It's  a deal.

I buy SILVER  Maples, Eagles and SIlver Rounds.   I will be buying 1oz of GOLD too in DEC.   The gentleman who helps me most of the time is Zepheniah Asbenson(ZEPH).     He's very cool, easy to talk to.. IN fact, the first time I walked in and didn't know anything about SIlver, he kind of educated me of what bars, rounds and coins are..

Go see ZEPHENIAH. He's cool.   and buy some SIlver and Gold. THeir prices are just just just awesome...  and when it's time to sell, they pay the highest too..</text>

<Review>Typical Motel 6, clean, looks just like the last Motel 6 you rented. The staff was pleasant, but I got there at shift change and had to wait about 10 minutes. No big deal. The only downer was there is no place for dogs to potty. There is a park several blocks East.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Places is crazy loud. I guess the owners dont care who hangs out inside their parking lot. If you're expecting to get good night rest I don't recommend this place. No ice. Hot tub was broken. I changed rooms but was charged the same.<//Text>

They had cigarette burns on the blanket. I saw roach had to sleep with the light on. Never saw so much activity in my life. For the price 120 for the way it looked not worth it. 65 okey 130 naw could of got something better. Never coming her again.< /review>

Surprisingly well maintained and updated. Clean and well-maintained the grounds are landscape well and the rooms are clean and nicely done. I travel from time to time and I am flagging this to come back to. Out of the hotels that I've stayed at this year this will be the only one that I will come back to.</text>

I like this very much even tho it's very active 24/7 and a whole lot goes on here but everyone seems to mind their own. Staff is always kind and meeting to your needs. They are always willing n trying to meet your needs. I am very comfortable. They could kinda make the rooms be nore cozy and welcoming tho.< /text>

<username>Expedia reviewer</username><review>Okay let me start off by saying I’ve never really been in this area but it was not what I expected at all, the location was horrible. There were a bunch of lady of the nights who stayed in the hotel I was staying in, there was also drug dealings going on. It was a mess. The room itself stunk of cigarettes and then when I washed my hands the water wasn’t going away and when I look a roach of a blunt came up to the surface. It was just not a good experience such a sketchy place. The other thing is I don’t understand why they’re charging 100$ a night in a place where you feel unsafe</review><response>None</response><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user>

Booked @ the Motel 6 website; I have to say it was the easiest and fastest check-in I've ever experienced! Handed the clerk my ID and within a minute she handed it back with my key and done!

Staff was friendly and rooms are nice especially for that part of town and compared to other rooms in same area.

Overall, no complaints...nice room, good service, good company... I will definitely book here next time I need a room in this area.</review>

I debated giving 2 stars or 3 stars for several reasons. There was a lot of activity at the motel.  Couldn't tell if they were guests or just coming in off the street. The saving grace was that the room was clean and neat and it did contain everything I needed, ample towels, wash clothes etc.  Go for the price which is rarely beaten but plan on putting up with a cast of characters roaming the grounds/parking lot.</review>

I stayed in the room for maybe 4 hours. I cut my overnight stay short as the bed had cigarette burns in the sheets, graffiti on the wall and oh yea, roaches in the room. As I began to eat my dinner I noticed a HUGE roach crawling along the wall. After closing up my food, protecting it from contamination/infestation, I noticed several smaller ones on the floor. At that point, I decided that this es not the place to stay. I went to tell the front desk who said they could not do anything to refund my money. I showed him the video and pictures capturing the infestation. He said talk to the manager.

I left at that point.

During my stay, the security of the property is poorly maintained. I witnessed several potential drug addicts, transients and what appeared to be non patrons doing as they pleased in the parking lot.</text></record>

<Text>Waited outside to check in and didn't get assistance for 10 minutes. Kept ringing bell and then waited in the car for another 10 min while the lady after me tried and waited.
It was also raining and very cold so waiting at a window outside for that long was not very ideal.
We both left.
Very poor customer service.</Text>< pics>

<review>ROACHES, yes people don’t leave your bags and clothes laying around. It was clean and people in the service desk window was friendly. But this owner really needs to look into this problem, and reconsider the high pricing for this hotel. The prices are higher in the weekend bc people show up with their hookers to check out a room. So This is definitely NOT a family friendly motel.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><username>Expedia reviewer</username><Response>None<//Response></record>

The motel is located in a rough neighborhood with lots of street workers and constant questionable activity everywhere, but the motel itself is nice because it was remodeled 3 months ago.  The room interiors are all freshly painted with new floors, fixtures, etc.  Probably the cleanest motel in the vicinity.</review>

I stayed here a couple nights ago and was so pleased with my stay. Myself and my mother were very happy with our service and were grateful for the front desk attendant Luis, who was very friendly, came out and helped us with our bags. It was very quiet and the room was clean. The only thing I disliked was that I had to walk to the office to use the microwave. The coffee was good though. Will definitely be back.< /text>

Room smelled, sheets and comforter stained. No support on the bed for back or neck.  Pillows were flat!   The staff were pleasant is the only good thing I can say about the place.

Very clean and spacious, with a mini fridge. We've stayed at a lot of Motel 6's, and this by far was our best experience. Will definitely return in the future! 🖤</Review>

<review>This is a no frills hotel with bullet proof glass between you and the front desk clerk. The room was clean, though it wreaked of cigarettes despite being a no smoking room. The hotel's location is in a neighborhood where being aware of your surroundings is a must. Don't expect an amazing resort experience - just a clean, spartan room in an older property. It's exactly what you are paying for.</review><time>1567124880334</time>< rating>

Do not stay here!!

Terrible experience. From the bad customer service- down to the hairs in the towels. I've stayed at many Motel 6 hotels.

This location is by far the worst experience I've had w/ Motel 6! Super disappointed..</review>

Access onto the property needs to be addressed so that patrons can enter and exit without incident.

<text>This place was horrible! They took all my stuff out of my pre-paid room saying I owed them money so I re-paid to get my things back only to have it refunded the next day without being told. They also went through my bags and threw things away. It was THE WORSE experience ever.</text>< Pictures>

<review>The room it self was great. I've never stayed a night in a hotel room that didn't have carpet, which was strange. It's was a cold night. So when I turned on the heater all of the heat escaped out of the room from underneath the door. There is a huge gap between the door and the floor....so turning on the heat was pointless.....that was a big problem for me..</review>< Pictures>

I have stayed here before and the first time was good.   It was exactly what you expect for a motel 6.  It was for a Halloween music festival.  Last night though... I attended a New Year's Eve festival and everything went well easy check in and exactly what you expect for a motel 6.  However this morning before my check out I was disgusted and disturbed when I had to kill not one but two roaches in the restroom.  They were babies too which concerns me.  Idk if I would stay here again.  The neighborhood is super ghetto which doesn't bother me but after my experience with the bugs I just dont know anymore.<//text>

<text>The cost of the one bedroom was around $70 which was great. Everything look amazing 😍. I wanted to live there. The pressure of the shower was hard but not too hard. The water temp stayed consistent. THE BED!!! 😍😍😍 It was soft and it big. It came with 4 PILLOWS!!! We ended getting the smoking room sadly because the others where all booked. But even then the smell of cigarettes wasn't that strong. There was cable, a mini fridge (with nothing in it), and an easy to use AC.< /text>< date>

Last minute stay. You get what you pay for.
I would recommend spend an extra $20.00 get a better place. Lacking of basics, like no irons. No hair dryer. No coffee maker. No shampoo only a small bar of soap. Bed was ok but sheets had hairs on it.< /Review>

< Review>
As we were ringing the room a man walked into the lobby wraps his arm around a woman and started choking her drag her outside and proceeded to assault a woman woman walks back in the office for safety where she did not find it man came back in to choke her out again and another man using the microwave had to detain him from hurting the woman the woman ran out of the office and down the street while the man got in his car and chase her down we do not know what happened to her after that what is she still lives or whether she's in his trunk oh yes and there was blood on her sheets. Other than that the room is decent you feel a little safer with the deadbolt inside the room is a whole nother world you feel like you're actually at a Motel 6 but once you step outside it's a completely different world you feel like you just stepped in a horror film so you can make your own decision and she stay at the motel or not< /Review>

<text>The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We slept well. The only unsatisfactory part was my room not having a microwave as it was suppose to, and when I asked for a room with a microwave or one to be brought into room, I was told by employee at front desk no to both fixes to get microwave. Unfortunately, the food I had purchased went to waste. as they required multiple steps of microwaving per the recipe. So, I asked for the front desk once again to compromise and accommodate a late check out as compensation and was told no again.</text>< time>

There were bees all over the floor, on the walls, in the bathroom - everywhere we looked we found dead and living insects. The front desk staff informed us that they would "look into it" and offered no form of compensation or reimbursement. One member of our group was allergic and getting stung could have resulted in a trip to the hospital. I will never stay at a Motel 6 again and would recommend that nobody ever stay in this disgusting hotel.</text>< pics>

Despite the location and downtown shenanigans I'd recommend it based on it being cost sufficient and clean on the inside. Some of the towels could use replacing as they were indeed washed(you can smell the detergent and bleach)yet still had stains.

Room had roaches, and when I came in the morning before work to extend my stay with a reservation the worker said I could not pay for the room with cash for 2 hrs. That caused me to have to check out by 11 am and I had to go to work. My work break is at noon, 20 miles away. this all started at 7:15 am. So my dogs are in the room I arrive 12:20 or so and try to pay to extend my stay. I cannot said the worker in office. Although I had a reservation. Because I was late on the check out. They already had contacted animal control too. So the management sucks there and I would not return.. I do like the San Bernardino south location. But downtown sucks.,< /Review>

< Review>
Although it was a complete upgrade from the hotel we had to stay at the night before, there were a few things that were a bit unpleasent or sketchy. The walls were paper thin, could hear EVERYTHING! From the person in the next room conversation, someone knocking a few doors away, etc. There was a few late night "business women" walking in the parking lot. I wouldnt have paid what I did just for 1 night. I could have spent 10.00 more and went to a 5☆, but I had no choice since the last hotel was not family friendly.<//Review>

This is the best motel I've been at so far in san bernardino. The rooms are clean and there are no bed bugs. Some times people are loud but that is expected at a hotel.</Review>

The Hotel is great.. The neighborhood is terrible. San Bernardino is an unsafe area from the freeway to waterman . It is sad that a business has to be bullet proof. It is unsafe to walk those streets, a police presence is needed.
The room was great.< /Text>

Upon arrival we saw 2 women walking near the entrance in the parking lot with their entire ass out. We saw people smoking weed, and several homeless people hanging out on the property. The room was dirty. The bedding was stained, towels dirty and pee stains drops on the tub.</text>

There wasn't any shampoo in the room. Parking was free for all, so be aware if you're back late it might be tough to get parking especially after an event. Anyway, recommend for just a bed. Real close to NOS center.</review>< username>

<gmapID>0x80c3533cf4962aaf:0x2d16d702949eb0d2< /gmapID><text>As of July 2017, this is a pretty new Motel 6; at least, the interior is new.

It was nice not to have ash trays in the room, finally! There was a very slight tobacco odor, though. It was not bad, but there were two cigarette burns on the tub. Some people just don't obey the rules!

Many of the bright-white towels had some type of mark on them. I suppose it is really hard to get stains out of white towels. They were grey and another had bright red fingernail polish on it.

The pool was not finished; but, I suppose it will be, soon.

There is a security guard during the day; but, they really need one at night to keep the locals from roaming through the parking lot. One guy was collecting cans at 4:30 in the morning. I do not begrudge him his living, but I don't like having to watch my car at that time. (I wish the motel had a recycling bin, too.)

On the plus side, I do like the new recessed lighting; it's very nice and contemporary!

The front desk people were very nice, letting us check in early. Thank you!< /text>< Resp>

Neighborhood was a bit sketchy and did not feel safe outside of the gates.
The quality of people who were there were also a little sketchy.<//Review>

Only thing I would recommend is that you make clear what time the rooms are available before a reservation. Other than that you guys are the best thank you to the cleaning ladies. Very professional and will definitely come back in the future.</review>

They try harder. In a run-down neighborhood, this is a safe haven with fully fenced parking, spotless, spacious, fresh smelling room, with frig & microwave. Grounds cleaned daily. A cut above the usual Motel 6 experience in southern California.< /text>

Super clean, and spacious. Sink was outside of bathroom (toilet and tub/shower), which I didnt mind. We picked a non smoking room, and as soon as we entered room was really stuffy and had faint smells of smoke. Could have been due to the room next door, since that one was not non smoking. Rooms have thin walls, and you can hear showers running from upstairs rooms, as well as medium loud noises from next door rooms. All in all, I would definitely stay here again as room was cheap, clean, and in a good location< /Text>

<Text>The room itself was pretty decent but the area that it's in is more than a little shady. We stayed here to go to a show at the Glen Helen Pavilion and outside our window we saw multiple prostitutes and a number of drug deals. The hotel served it's purpose but I don't think I'll be staying here again.< /Text>< Date>

Plus- Great upgrade ! The gentlemen at the front desk were very accommodating at check-in and check-out. I will be returning in the future.

Neg.-The bedspread had burns and housekeeping could clean better because hair was left in the bathroom. The room needed to be aired out but I had Fabreeze.The housekeeping needs to be more respectful when dealing with the public.< /review>

The room was clean and the beds were nice. Only real complaint i have is the remote was ether dead or broken and we couldn't get the front desk to answer the phone or door. The pool is drained it's the middle of summer they should have that fixed. The area around the motel isn't the best. If you stay there at night stay inside or drive your car don't walk around.< /text>

<Review>Room was ok however, the bathroom reeked like marijuana. No matter what I did I could not get rid of the smell. Definitely not in a good part of town. I didn't feel comfortable walking across the street at 9pm.< /Review>< name>

I booked early  it was just okay  and only just okay because they let me check in early I drove 9 hours just for a friends proposal.  The house keeping were a bit rude and we're on their phone and told me to wait after asking me if I needed anything.  The bedding were stained and pillows still had some guests hair on it .  There's no late check out  and there are homeless people that knock on your room door to ask for money or to sell you random things.. only good experience was meeting my friend . Hopefully motel 6 can correct some of these problems  now that they took over the building . I been to some great motel 6 and always recommend them but until then this hotel I will wait a while before coming back</Text>

Just a room with a shower and bed. Didn't even provide shampoo. Someone had a dog going crazy at night in another room. There were homeless people sitting on the ground right in front of the front office. Loud music could be heard around 2am, and then someone was screaming bloody murder at about 4am. You can find much better for $78.</review>

<Text>We stayed at this location because it was close to the Glen Helen Amphitheater where we were attending Hard Summer. Not going to lie it felt pretty ghetto when we first pulled up there were a lot of bums out front wanting money my girlfriend was even offered crack for the WiFi password. We got to the room and I was actually impressed it was nice inside just the cigarette smell was pretty bad. The security guard was also nice made sure that we were taken care of all and all it wasn't a bad trip.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I would sincerely reccomend this hotel to anyone needs respite when visiting this area. The place is clean. The attendants are professional and reliable 24 hrs a day. Despite the fact that the neighboring community has overall impoverishment issues dileamma this place still shines despite and is a haven of rest for the traveller<//Text>

< Review>
Refrigerator doesn't work and they don't have a microwave. When I stayed here last month these things weren't a problem. The guy in the front keeps promising to bring in a new fridge but hasn't after about 4 says. I'm leaving today. My food went bad btw. And the house keepers keep walking in on me and my kids without knocking first and they're very rude!</Review>

Staff was nice and the room was ok. Terrible neighborhood, there was quite a bit of unwelcoming activity going on in the lot and rooms. Not worth $120 for one night at all. Pretty much didn't feel safe leaving the room.< /Review>

Upon arrival the entire front part of motel smelled like weed.  The neighborhood is very ghetto but the motel does have security - at least cars were safe.  The staff was very helpful. It was a very hot day and no water in the pool.  The restroom had mildew on ceiling.  However, the room was very modern and clean.  So for a 1 night stay it served it purpose.< /review></record>

<Text>Had to stay there for a couple of weeks with my family when we were having an issue with our house because it was the most livable affordable motel in SB. The rooms are very nice. I believe they were recently renovated. They have a fridge and microwave. Lots of storage space. The managers always helped with whatever you needed. I would rate 5 if it wasn't for the location its in. There's always homeless people trying to sell you something that's complete junk or trying to squat in the walkway or on the steps. The gas station across the street is obviously a drug deal spot. They make it known clear as day. Always a lot of commotion outside at night.<//Text>< Pictures>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Handicapped room: No seat in the shower, shower handrails not secure, no soap shelf, no handheld sprayer.
Toilet: no paper roll on wall -- paper sitting on back of toilet.
Room: no place to hang clothes; feet turned black from walking on hard floor; TV buzzing, missing channels, no channel list, nothing standard.
Other: Bulletproof glass in lobby made me feel like it was in a war zone; staff dressed sloppy & slow to perform check in; pool drained empty.
This is a FRANCHISE, not a corporate property. It is SO bad it doesn't deserve to have the M6 brand on it.</review>< time>

<review>The room was clean, but the pool was out of service. The location of this hotel is in a bad part of town. Lots of homeless and sketchy looking people. Would have given less stars but i Gave 3 stars because the room was very clean. Only thing was that bothered me about the room is that you could tell that it had been smoked in. You can tell they tried to get the smell out but it still had a slight smoky smell. overall my experience was ok. The room was great but the rest of the facility and the area is very run down.<//review><user>112264373438474760501</user></record>

This is an extremely bad part of town and the property should not be allowed to show the Motel 6 affiliation! it should be franchised out to some other private name. it is not recommended at all for traveling guests.

<text>We killed a big, gross COCKROACH during our 1-NIGHT stay :( there was MOLD GROWING ON THE WALL of the bathroom :( Our sheets had brown stains on them :( no microwave dish for the microwave so we couldn't microwave anything... fridge was unplugged when we got in so we couldn't use it right away... the television looked like the pixels were burning out on every single edge of the screen... and there was no way to plug the drain to take a bath... Mold growing on the wall of the restroom + the cockroach made our stay absolutely horrible & DISGUSTING!!!! This place is horrible, I would never recommend anyone stay there... it should be closed due to HEALTH HAZARDS!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

<Text>When the hotel clerk is behind safety glass you have to wonder how safe are you?!!!  The pool was empty, no landscaping, no parking for registering, and interesting neighborhood.  I had a reservation or I would have kept driving.  When the WiFi did not stay connected I was told to open my door and stand there.  What???  Ah, no.

The room was very large with a large king size bed.  It looked new and clean inside.  Who ever cleans the room did a nice job and even folded the towels in an ornate way to add extra charm.

Even though this place tells you to park in the marked handicap spaces while registering for your room, don't do it.  If you get caught parking there with out a handicap placard you can get fined $250.

Interesting experience.  Sooo glad I had a dog.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< review>
I had called in advance for early checkin of 2pm, had reservations for a no smoking bedroom with refrigerator for about $75.00 a night. I was approved the early check in. Upon arrival at 3pm I was told my $$ was incorrect and they tried to up my nightly rate to $150 a night and told me no refrigerator was available, I argued as I had a reservation, I called customer care line waited for 20 minutes prior to hanging up, with no help. Finally got in room and refrigerator was provided but rusted, TV didnt work and room was not up to my living standards, as a new hotel how can it be in this much disarray.
I contacted Rudy at the front desk but nothing was done, it was uncomfortable to see prostitutes in the area and the hotel cleanliness this way. What honest hotel tries to double the price upon arrival?? We were there for a weekend getaway that turned out not to be to pleasant and very disappointing to the MOTEL 6 brand, again no answer when calling the customer service line and no assistance from local staff to fix TV, rusted refrigerator or cleanliness of the room.<//review>

<review>Hi the hotel is brand new and still under construction. The lobby isn't finished and guests are not allowed to enter the construction site so it was a little confusing at check in.

I had reserved a non-smoking room and when I arrived in my room there were ash trays everywhere. I was exhausted and didn't have the energy to figure out the lobby, and pack up and move all of my things.

Additionally, when I attempter to call the front dest the phone in my room was not working.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This is going to be long and I apologize. If you only plan to spend two or three nights then this is a good place for you. If you are looking for a homey kind of room and planning for a longer stay you might need to look elsewhere. But please keep in mind this is a budget motel. Even with the negatives I would give this location three and a half stars.

My wife and I had to rent a motel room for several days while waiting for our new residence to be ready.
We chose Motel Six because it was pet friendly for our little dog. This Motel Six is not in the best area, with working girls around and doing what working girls do. However within the motel area we did feel secure. The room we stayed in was a very large corner room, over 200 square feet. The rooms have been recently remodeled and now they don't exactly shout "Welcome." Hospital sterile is not a good look, seriously.

The only things that break up the monotonous  walls are the window, an air conditioner, and a nice sized flat screen TV. There were no wall mounted lamps next to the large king size bed, not even the mandatory tacky artwork on the walls. The ceiling lighting is in keeping with the room design, recessed, white, and sterile, as if the designers didn't know they make flourescent light bulbs that duplicate the warm welcome feeling of the incandescent ones. In fact I even brought one of my own lamps from home.

The clothes hanging rack is miniscule, just two small posts protruding from the wall with not enough room between them to allow the hangers not to overlap each other. If you have more than eight items of clothing to hang I am afraid you are out of luck. Below that are three small shelves, the only places in this very large room to put folding clothes. Both of these will be an issue for any guy who has a wife or a girlfriend.

This leads to the lack of surfaces. There is a half table mounted to the wall along with two Spartan Ikea type chairs. The bathroom sink area didn't need to have such a small surface area, as to one side there was a fifteen inch empty space between it and the adjacent wall. Again remember the wives and girlfriends. There is no dresser or chest of drawers as is found in most motel rooms to store your clothes, thus there is no top surface on which to set anything either. In summary it is as if Motel 6 did the remodel on the cheap with no thought toward the convenience and comfort of its customers, especially leaving out wives and girlfriends.

That is too bad, since the staff there is great. I had no problems with the rudeness of the housekeeping staff of which other reviewers have mentioned. And if I did I wouldn't hold it against them. They are working at a hard minimum wage job, often with no tips for their good service. And the office staff are all very nice people, always willing to help with a friendly smile and that is a huge plus for travelers. I just wish that in this case at least Motel Six was on par with its employees.
PS: On the plus side Motel Six provides in room mini refrigerators. 😁😁😁<//Text>

<text>Absolute worst motel 6 I have ever stayed at. There were towels that had dirt on them still. The floor had drops of blood and it’s ridiculous how there is no non smoking rooms. My asthma flared up because of the absolutely obnoxious amount of smoke smell that was lingering in the room. Also the beds blanket had cigarette holes and it was an off putting brown color. In a lot of way health inspection or some county body should be called on this motel. It was absolutely disgusting. Also the service was rude and even asking a simple question the front desk gave short demeaning answers.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c3533cf4962aaf:0x2d16d702949eb0d2</Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><username>Pedro Nguyen<//username>< pictures>

This has been, by far, the worst motel experience we have ever had. The other guests would blast their music from their cars until 4 am and the management never said one word to them. They just shrugged their shoulders. It is worth the extra money to stay somewhere else. We will never stay here again.<//Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Pics>None<//Pics><text>Things my friends and I saw in my 8 hours at this motel:
-Some guy just staring at us intensely as we pulled in from the second floor
- 2 separate groups of tweakers going into 2 separate rooms for about 10 mins to get drugs
- A (probably) prostitute across the street going from car to car just trying her luck
- A guard goose outside someone's house
- A security guard at the nearby In N Out asking a man to leave who was being loud and then just giving up on that when the man refused to leave
Room was mostly clean except for the graffiti on the mirror which they at least attempted to remove. Most of this is San Bernadino's fault, not Motel 6's.<//text>< rating>

been here before and the managers/service people are on it! even the polite lot attendant guy was nice enough to direct me on parking because im a newer driver and struggle to back into spots. there was a deveoping mold spot in th bathroom but im assuming they working on it since it was patched recently. clean, smells nice, and feels safe (although sometimes there are strange fellows across the street, they never bother the motel!) and definitely will reccomend, and go again!</text>

Room was dirty,  had to ask for a cleaning which they did so badly  the dirt around the doors,  beds,  & on the night stand as well as the top of the AC had to be pointed out for cleaning.
- not to mention the roaches.

<review>Not only was this property in poor condition, but the neighborhood was not safe.  Employeees were asleep behind the glass barriers.  This was the worst place I have ever stayed in.  We rented two rooms and one room only had one light working - the other room the bathroom light was broken.  No-one answered our calls to fix it to the front office.< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>First off the area is very sketchy. Lot of people hanging around. The receptionist are like in some panic room type office behind bullet proof glass.I thought I was at a bank for a moment. Lots of people looking out their windows like if they are waiting for something, or someone. The rooms are ok , but I did get some bug bites. I have sensitive skin so they appeared shortly after I laid in bed. Half used roll of toilet paper upon arrival. Let's just say this isn't one of their better kept locations.<//Review><Name>Mario Urbina< /Name>< Pics>

Receptionist is not friendly at all. Rooms are not clean. Some pillows had a weird stains. I was itchy and had several insect bits during  the one night I stayed there. Towels are not white anymore; they have some grey stain patches. Fridge is disconnected and smells.< /text>

The only real issue I had was the internet. Most of the time it didn’t work and wouldn’t connect. It was incredibly frustrating as I was relying on it for a WiFi only tablet. BIG let down.</review>

<text>This was the most disgusting place I have ever stayed at. My sheets were the same sheets the previous person in the room had used, they did not change my bed sheets before I had checked in. There was very obvious dirt all over my bed sheets and drool stains all over the pillows. The water from the sink comes out white and chalky, I honestly can't even give this disgusting place a star for their customer service.

(Translated by Google) The room was neat and clean. However, the area is very run down and the access road or the parking lot are permanently patrolled by strange figures who seem to secure the "business activities" within certain rooms ...

(Original)
Das Zimmer war ordentlich und sauber. Allerdings ist die Gegend sehr runtergekommen und die Zufahrtsstraße bzw. der Parkplatz werden dauerhaft von merkwürdigen Gestalten patrouilliert, die anscheinend die "Geschäftstätigkeiten" innerhalb bestimmter Zimmer absichern sollen...< /Review>
