<review>they have so many quality products that can meet your growing needs. i went in and they helped me choose a soil, and some very quality pest control (all organic). They are super informative as well. I've decided that they will be THE place to go to for all my gardening/growing needs. Great prices too..cheaper than what i've seen it retail for.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2cea034ce83d:0xa909796fb0ea0e60<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing spot for hydroponics information and materials. Guys are EXTREMELY knowledgeable in everything. Scott that runs the place literally can point you in the right direction and give you fact for fact of what you're trying to accomplish. Taylor is right up there with Scott. Great warehouse. If they don't have something or don't stock it. They can get it to your front door within days. Best place to go. Thanks guys!<//Text>

I really like this store. Being new to gardening and having more questions than money didn't deter Taylor or Tony from patiently answering all of my questions. I appreciate that.
They have a well stocked and organized store with very good (see low) pricing.
General Organics Go Box....It was on sale for less than the lowest price I could find on Amazon!
My nephew, Steven, told me that Fox Farms Ocean Forest Potting Soil is the best.The store has 1.5 cu ft bag of FF OF for $10.. Until now, I've been paying for a smaller, yet more expensive bag from the store I used to go to ;).
They're very easy to get to, right off the 5 freeway. Handicapped Parking  and access, very savvy and helpful staff. Spectrum has both Indoor and Outdoor gardening supplies and equipment. 5 Stars</text>

I highly recommend Spectrum Hydro!  I was recommended by a friend who told me they were knowledgeable, friendly, well stocked and would price match. I was more than pleased with the help I received from Taylor, and there was no need to price match because their prices are the best around!  Definitely worth the 1.5 hour drive for me. I enjoy spreading the word when you can help others and the business. Thank you, Spectrum Hydro!<//review>

<review>I was actually blown away by this place.  They have everything I need in stock, from different size and type of pots, to lights, growing mediums, and all the brands of nutrients i need and want and prices i can afford. Usually I'm forced to buy more then i need and will use.  But they carry so many different sizes, its perfect for me. And go on Tuesdays to get a gallon of compost tea.  Bring a jug or buy one for $2. I have been back and will continue to go back for all my garden needs. They were also helpful with answering all my questions.< /review>< UserId.>

These guys are so knowledgeable when it comes to gardens of all types.  The owner goes above and beyond to get whatever it is you want and or need, if he does not have it...which they have everything.

Usual terrible hydro experience... no one greets you when you enter....employees will look at you and continue their conversation.... Originally came in because they also post on Offerup which has completely different prices but confirmed before I went to location .....then Finally was helped by a bald orange troll looking character who had no product knowledge and even said things had features they didn’t...got to the register confirm prices and get told I’m getting a discount! Now I was a dummy for trusting without checking the receipt first, I wanted build a relationship..... Finally get in the parking lot look at my receipt to see no discount and no of the prices were the same as discussed ( they were basically retail).... Once again I take responsibility for not fully looking at the prices but then again can’t a customer trust the business to do what they say they will do? Honestly the day of experts in products knowledge are over mostly hustlers, idiots, and scammers left....No longer supporting local Hydro online is much better faster more accurate and I hope you guys adjust or go out of business as you should.... Have a great day< /review>

Not knowing exactally what i as shopping for I had so many questions.   When I asked for some assistance Taylor and Crystal were more than happy to help! They answered all of my questions, made suggestions as to what I needed (without being pushy) and they were so, so patient.  I don't live close but I will make the 3 hour trip every time I need something.< /review>

<Gmap_id>0x80c28692a3c82aa1:0x16a293b690c4ab1a</Gmap_id><text>I needed a consultation about the current eviction laws (May 2021) as I am in the process of due diligence to purchase a SFH with an existing tenant.

I needed an expert in this specific niche of landlord law, the information he provided gave me additional knowledge to make an informed decision.
The consultation was very good- answered my questions accurately and gave me the knowledge to factor into how or if I wished to proceed.

To make the best use of time, before the telephone consult, the office sent me a simple questionnaire  to fill out prior to the paid telephone consult. This form asked for background information about the purpose of the call and what I hoped to accomplish.

This was a good idea as I was able to distill my thoughts into direct questions and think of other questions that could be answered during the consult. By giving the information prior, David P was up to speed on what I needed and no time was wasted.

If you are a owner/landlord with rental property I suggest you have a consultation (telephone works well) with David if you have any inkling or thought there may be any legal or potential legal challenges in dealing with tenants. Being accurately informed before something happens or gets out of hand is well worth your time.

I  am very happy with the legal advice he provided. Now I made a well informed decision</text>< Rating>

This review has been long overdue. Atty. David helped me late last year. So, here it goes!=)

It's really hard to find a lawyer who has your back, especially in times when you really needed one like ASAP due to a time constraint tenant matter. Atty David exceeded all my expectations!!! I had a great experience with him all the way from start to finish. I really appreciated how he took the time to listen to me, how patient he was all throughout the process, and it’s so true from another reviewer here that Atty. David is a genuine Atty who I felt at that time truly had my back. From our initial converstaion, his voice was a calming factor to my stressful situation. We also had a back and forth correspondence via phone/email and I was so amazed as to how he was so verrryyyy patient with me by my many questions and last minute changes for a letter he was formulating. The payment process was also easy and reasonable and he also made sure that I got the best service from him before I made the payment. Isn’t that wonderful?!=))) I’ve dealt with other lawyers before (by phone/in-person consultations pre-covid), but with Atty. David, I’ve never been this worry/anxious-free that he could help me genuinely to make the tenant process a comfortable one. THANK YOU ATTY. DAVID! This guy is now our go-to lawyer for any tenant matters.=) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! A+++++< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>If you think 2020 was a challenging year, imagine you're a landlord/owner of a small residential property stuck in an eviction case without receiving a penny of rent since January 2020. I hired David for my eviction case in March 2020 due to missing rents pre covid. Unfortunately Covid hit and all evictions were banned and my case was in a halt since..for almost a year!! It has been a really trying year for me and I couldn't be more grateful to have David by my side fighting through this long and stressful process. From the very beginning and thru out the entire year,  David has always reached out whenever there's an update or there's a new law (which incurred so many times last year). He has always been extremely patient and thorough with every detail with the process. He has precise understands of the law so that he'd  lay out different options for me in preparation for different projected outcomes of my case.
Because of David's great effort fighting for my case and his extraordinary knowledge of the law, the court finally granted a judgement against the tenant at the end of last month and sheriff showed up for the lockout last week. Finally I was able to take possession of my own property after almost a year! And I owe it all to David's excellent work on my case and endless support along the way!
It is really tough for landlords right now more than ever. David is hands down the best attorney you can trust and rely on to fight for your eviction battle and win!!< /Text>< pics>

<text>We chose first to have an information gathering Q&A with David to see what possible options we might have in dealing with a hostile tenant that was refusing to pay rent or utilities and also refusing to allow prospective buyers to view the property.  We found David to be tremendously helpful in defining all aspects and possible actions to take (and NOT to take) as well as the timing and flow of the necessary process(es).  David is extremely knowledgeable in this area. We found him to be very easy to interact with, and also thoughtful and patient with our many questions (and our frustrations with this tenant issue).  We would not hesitate to utilize more of his expertise and experience now or in the future.<//text>< UserId.>

David Piotrowski is a professional who provides excellent services to clients. I was impressed with his commitment to keep clients informed. For example, David promptly returned my calls and sent me emails explaining the process and timelines to address and resolve the issue with my tenant. I am very satisfied with his services and highly recommend David to Landlords struggling with tenant issues.<//text>

< Review>
I am a realtor for over 30 years. I have had come across many eviction processes for my clients as well as my own. I also have dealt with few other eviction attorneys prior.
My experience with David Piotrowski has been the best so far. Process was as expected and expressed by David. David is prompt in his responses and follow ups. Truly appreciated his professional expertise and results. By all means I will recommend him to all.</Review>

<Review>David is a top class attorney.  He pays great attention to detail, is common sensed, and is very honest.  His legal work is excellent. I had the judge at a trial I had even comment on how excellently written David's 3 day notice, which was the primary reason for my winning that case.  David also explains to his client each step of the way. You can't go wrong with this guy.<//Review>< Pics>

Answered all my questions, kept on answering them (hey, I've never had to evict anyone before), finally had to remind me all the free advice he was doling out, he should have been charging for.

He communicates (primarily via email) well with his clients.  However, if you need to talk to him, he makes himself available based on his schedule. I have been very satisfied with his services and would highly recommend him for your unruly tenants.< /Review>< pictures>

Great service!!  Our rental home is in California and we live in the East Coast. Imagine going through all the trouble in evicting a tenant from long distance!! David handled everything (many steps involved) beautifully as promised on time. I would not look anywhere else if we have to go through the same process again in future.</Review>

David as usual was prompt and professional in handling my troublesome tenant situation.  It was great comfort to have David's expertise and experience in evictions to soothe my nerves as the initial phase unfolded. Thankfully the tenant decided to suddenly leave, so no further steps were necessary.  Thanks again David for being there with your excellent legal services. 5-stars plus<//review>

<Review>Law office of David Piotrowski helped our company with the tariff. He was very easy to work with. Job was done efficiently and very fast. The price is very reasonable too. I was also very pleased when David made the correction of my mistake in the papers even when all the papers were already done without any complaints or extra charges. And he was very nice and helpful at all times.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1438187636716, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words!'}</Response>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>We are all such busy people and when the tenant stopped paying it was just another task.  While I knew I was not experienced in these matters I chose the Do-it-yourself method.  Turned out to be very costly, one mistake and you start all over again.  The rent-o-meter was clicking faster than a crooked taxi.  I chose to find a professional.  David is the man, communicated every step of the way.  California does not favor the landlord so we need all the help we can get.  From the posting of the notices to the tenant lockout, his professional experience made the process go as quickly as possible.  This by no means is an inexpensive undertaking but when it is finished you will thank yourself for doing it right.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< review>
This was my first experience with using an eviction attorney.  I heard these horror stories of evicting renters taking more than six months to remove. To my surprise, David Piotrowski filed all paperwork and processes to remove my deadbeat tenants.  They were out in less than two months.  Because of my slow responses to David’s requests, The elapsed time probably could've been shorter. I would highly recommend David Piotrowski to any landlord seeking eviction of deadbeat tenants</review>

<Review>I have retained David on a number of unlawful detainer matters over the past two years.  He has always been highly professional, very accessible when I need to contact him, his fees are reasonable, and he achieves excellent results.

The cases I have called him on have always been the problem cases, and he has never disappointed me.  I would highly recommend him on UD cases.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

For our Acai Bowls we use Organic Fair Trade Acai, it is sweetened, from Sambazon which is one of the best out there. Please know you can also customize these to your liking.

To be honest, the smoothies and acai bowls are good, BUT THEY ARE EXTREMELY SWEET. I look for healthy things to put in my system, but this one reminds me of Jamba Juice.<//text>

This location is hit or miss (more miss than hit). The service here is blah no smiles, they drag, and don’t speak when you walk in NOTHING. Only time I come to this one is if I’m in a rush otherwise I go to the other Downey location.</Text>

<Review>The food all tastes amazing and you can tell it's made with a lot of love. The decor is very nice but you can be casual. They always play the latest Indian music videos on their tv's and it's pretty cool to watch.  They have a great all you can eat buffet on most days for $11.95! Very yummy and filling!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFlEsT4c5a0lubmF5x3uQQFmz3j9Db38OlIQ8_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuH3bMf-Eb_2aZCUx_XO7thy8-uyOqIQBwAod9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnFj9W_hOaIDvnBPrLvtxcMzmEd08CCRkQ2pbg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMicOo7X1DetLSapTY1iA3FL0hz5n3sSm2vqvfH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBZagfM_C45YNmFSrkEwO95Ul-CLphzngPe2g0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP29-YKtb8g5t5IF2kur8NQwDjLqcTL6_w_fnM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP03HoVKxIDamyRTxOqMBMEdf1MFsyPnPyLOU32=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80d953583b404cc1:0x431258fe6de690a6< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Love this place for Indian food. They have all the classics like naan and Somosas. This is a great place to come, especially if you are a vegetarian because they have lots of options. They have a great atmosphere and really good drinks.<//text>

We came for the lunch buffet. The food was pretty good. I particularly like the curry dish. The service was decent, unlike what other reviewers mentioned above. There was no wait. It was good for some quick in and out lunch.</Text>

Food was delicious. The hottest option for spicy food is actually spicy (I have a high tolerance so usually I can't find things that I consider spicy). The atmosphere is fun. I've only been once so I don't want to say "expect this", but it seemed to take a while for the food. Timing is only reason I didn't give 5 stars, but again, I've only been once and it could've been "one of those days"</text>

I entered this restaurant with a little trepidation and the trepidation soon vanished as food came to our table. The flavors were awesome the food was awesome the server was awesome there were no off flavors in the food and the rice was beautiful and moist.... the naan bread was crispy and delicious. We are extremely pleased with the meal here and the service and will be back again definitely.</text>

<Review>Very friendly staff. Interesting, clean interior. Decent music. Food was pretty good, but not my favorite Indian food, even in the neighborhood. Prices reflect the uber-hipster neighborhood (high).

Other than the high prices, and the fact that there is a better Indian food within walking distance, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this place, and it has the best interior of any Indian restaurant I've been to in San Diego. However I will not be going back.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Really nice facility with.decent food.  There are however much better options in the area.  Even though the place was empty it took some effort to get our check.  Cannot imagine when its busy.<//Review>

Great food at reasonable prices in a good atmosphere. Service is always friendly but can be excruciatingly slow, for no apparent reason. One complaint about the atmosphere is the filthy crystal chandeliers. I personally love them and think they look amazing, but if you're going to have crystal, keep it clean.  As it is, they look like they belong in a haunted house.< /Text>

The ambiance is great and the food I had was great as well. The service could've been better. The waiter took a little long to take our initial order,  but he was helpful navigating us through the menu and gave good recommendations. If you're  sensitive with spice, don't be alarmed.  They have a spice scale from 1 to 10. I got the 7 and it was a little spicier than I could handle, but it didn't take away from the taste. Overall the food was good and the ambiance is peaceful and relaxing.<//Review>

Food was decent but the bad service over shadowed all. First the restaurant was about 2/3rds capacity on a weds and they didn't have enough menus so we were seated without.

A gentleman gave us water then we didn't see another waiter for ten minutes.

While waiting we watched guests get seated with menus, while we were still here unable to order food because we didn't have ones of our own or a waiter.

Finally waved down the hostess and reminded her we needed menus. She brings us one. Once the waiter shows up we order. I got a cocktail and appetizer.

Our main course arrived before both my drink and my appetizer. Was not worth the price at all.<//review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>I usually don't post any comments, but I need to say about one of favorite eateries in San Diego. I have been to this place many times, and recently I have been with my friends for lunch. I felt that they have changed the menus in the buffet which we all loved it. The potato with bell peppers was melting in mouth and it reminds my home and the coconut rice was the best coconut rice in San Diego I have ever had. Before it was quite boring with all the same stuffs. I was totally amazed with authentic Indian flavors on my taste buds. The food is absolutely worth for the money you pay. Hope to see you soon:-)< /text>< Gmap_id>

COMPLETELY DISRESPECTFUL! I called to ask about prices and seating and the person over the phone told me they didn't have time to talk to me and quickly hung up. Talk about bad customer service. And then I called back bc I needed answers and they told me the same thing and before I could finish my question, another hang up. I've been there and they're completely rude to their customers and look like they hate working there. Don't be fooled by how beautiful the place is.<//Review>

Excellent service, excellent food and the ambiance is something to talk about. From the ceiling to floor waterfall to the lovely belly dancer, from the perfect lighting to the Bollywood videos, our family had an enjoyable time. Many thanks!<//Text>

Oh Man! The place is so beautiful. But the food is extremely worse and tastless and substandard. They need to change their chef. Highly disappointed for food. I called in complain about the food. The lady at the reception took my number, my last 5 digits of my card but Management didn't even bother to call back. It seems they have lot of money hence they don't care about food and customers.<//review>

We got a Groupon for this place and decided to try it out. The staff was pretty friendly, it's not a super busy place but their food is pretty good. We were there on a Monday late lunch, that might be why it wasn't so busy. I absolutely love the atmosphere in the decor, it's so beautiful in there.<//text>

I alternate between giving Bombay four or five stars. When they are good, they are really good! In fact they are easily the best Indian restaurant in San Diego, perhaps all of Southern California! And yes I've tried all the others including several others in Hillcrest and a bunch of them off of Miramar Road. Bombay is awesome, the food is phenomenal and the setting and Ambience are incredible with water features and lighting and beautiful authentic decor. Only minus is that sometimes the staff could be a bit more attentive, IA your glass can sit empty for a couple of minutes before anyone notices you want a refill but other than sleep labs in service this is an awesome amazing restaurant that features a daily lunch buffet at a very reasonable price! Oh, and this is owned by a local family, not a huge restaurant chain so go and support local restaurateurs!</text>

If I had option, I would have rated negative 5. We had a reservation for 7.30pm and apparently had to wait for 20min for a table. After a wait for another 10 min we had to literally hunt down a waiter, just to talk to us. After all this, they had the audacity to say, we are a bit lost and under staffed, you can leave if you wish to. Typical Indian chalta hai attitude.

The folks who were already having dinner buffet, apparently were complaining many items were already finished for the day. They were charging 19 bucks for a half buffet - goodness gracious...my humble request to the City of  San Diego, "Ban the restaurant from any further business."< /Text>

<Review>Nearly the best Indian food in San Diego, Bombay's always a hit with out of towners and those looking for an upscale Indian restaurant. The new location isn't as cozy as the old place and the restaurant has lots a bit of its "hidden treasure" quality. The food's always high quality and made with fresh ingredients.<//Review>< pics>

It's not a bad place. The decor is beautiful. I know, right? A food critique that starts with the decor. Lol.
The food is good. It's well suited for the American palate. It was a bit bland. The samosas were wonderful, they were very light.
BUT the SAMBAR was the best I've had anywhere and I go to India every year!
So there! :)<//review>

The food was decent but if I wanted to spend three hours eating dinner (and by that I mean the service is abysmally slow) I would go to Spain. Seriously. Slowest service in all of SD. Either hire more servers or post up a sign saying, "Sorry we are slow but our food is great!"< /Text>

<review>Food is good but service is getting worst and worst from last one year.  We have to tell them 6 time to bring water, water comes after 15mins. Ordered food arrived before getting plates. Plates came 15mins after food comes, food gets cold, they forget to get some bread waiting for another 10 mins, food is super cold by then. Only thing came fast was a bill. Don't recommend anymore. Used to be good place, was my favorite place, but not anymore.</review>< Gmap_id>

My wife and I stopped by to see if there was anything available Friday evening and grabbed one of the last open tables.  I felt under dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. Service was attentive but a little slow getting drinks and food out. Food was ok.  A little over spicy even at medium, and luke warm (I prefer steaming hot plates).  Given they were full/busy this was expected.  The live belly dancer pretty much bumped the rating and made our experience.  Without her presence I would say they deserve the current 3.8 star rating.</Text>

<review>I thought I would treat myself to a Chicken Tikka Masala on my final night in the Marriot hotel.
I ordered the food for delivery at 6.50pm via Eat24.
45minutes later I requested an ETA through EAT24 they messaged me saying 8.01pm. At 8.15 I called the restaurant, they were busy and did not answer. I messaged Eat24 at 8.20 they said restaurant said 10 minutes or less. At 8.50 I messaged Eat24 to let them know I've been waiting over 2 hours and still no food.
They contacted the restaurant and was put on hold!! They were told the order had not left yet. Eat 24 asked to speak to the manager who told them that his driver lagged and he had to pay someone else out of his own pocket to deliver the food to me.
The food finally arrived 2 hours 20 minutes later. The food was stone cold!! I am certain it was sitting in the bag in their restaurant for over an hour.
I have no way to warm it up as I don't have a microwave in my room.
I messaged Eat24 and let them know the food was cold and incredibly late. They contacted the restaurant who told them that they are not willing to do anything!
I couldn't tell you if the food was good. It tasted awful cold. The naan bread was hard. The samosa was a little damp but tasted ok.
I'm done complaining for the night!!
I wouldnt recommend this place due to their lack of customer service and not taking care of their mistakes.
Definitely don't use their delivery option<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Of the restaurants we visited, Bombay Exotic Cuisine of India had the most elaborate and impressive offering at the Taste of Hillcrest 2013 -- presenting buffet style samplings of several dishes and a lady dancing with fire fingers to keep those in the long line entertained while they waited to get in! Great atmosphere and food - will definitely go back for a full meal.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

Buffet is $15 per person and comes with an Indian bread. The services were nice with good atmosphere. However it is a bit slow with the adequate staff, and the food is not really that Indian and pretty bland.< /text>

<Review>Right now in table with kids. They Took 30 mins to take an order. It's chaos in  all tables across. Attendee esp one lady , Nija, is a  big lier.  She literally served guests next to us who came almost half an hour later. Pissed off!  Good food.</Review>< GmapID>

Californian version of Indian Cuisine.  If you like Indian food adjusted for the Californian palate, you'll be happy, but if you are looking for authentic, this definitely isn't my favorite spot.< /Text>

<text>Not authentic Indian food. Tofu was in a dish meant for Paneer which makes it not even Indian food. Items they serve like "mac n cheese pakoda" are just not good. Okay for buffet lunch. Not many vegetable choices. Food was okay, could have been spicier. Daal was not cooked properly. Good for American taste but not authentic Indian.
Overall 3 star food, 5 star service, 5 star ambience. Manager was nice and provided good service.</text>< user>

We visited December 19th 2015 on the occasion of nephew's wedding....table decor exoctic, general decor and waterfall very appealing. The service, appetizers,and main meal were excellent.The personalized care by the owner was extremely commendable!! Not only did he pack a dinner for a family member who was  unable to attend the festivities, he even drove us back to our hotel,when he knew we needed a cab!! Thank you Rakesh!!<//Text>

< Review>
I am from Bombay! And I have never had this bad taste food in my life. The chicken Biryani is mixed with vegetables.. I didn't know wheather I am eating Biryani or Vegetable pulav with chicken in it. Chilli Chicken was extremely sweet and they Use Chicken Tikka Cubes for chilli chicken! I don't know who taught the chef that this is called Chilli chicken. Man the only thing at this place good is the ambience but food is way too bad...... Suggestion : Train the chefs of change.< /Review>

Food at lot of different places. But the food at this
Place is completly opposite of Indian food. So First I ordered Mango Lassi it was sour the only time lassi gets sour when it is old bcuz of Yogurt. Second I ordered chilli chicken, chicken biryani. Well, the chilli chicken was not "Chilli" at all but it was Ketchup sweet! Really chef?? Chicken Biryani. Well it was not biryani it was Pulav mixed with chicken. Only the Vegetable biryani has vegitables not Chicken biryani. So their Chicken biryani was with vegitables like Caluflower, Squash etc..also the Biryani comes with Raita, you guys don't even give raita. well, chef you should go and learn indian cooking. I have attached a picture of throwing the entire food. The Most horrible food I have ever had. Abmience is Great 5/5 but Food 0/5.</review><Name>Kris Luther</Name></record>

Five stars for the service! Five stars for the atmosphere! Five stars for the entertainment! My husband and I flew into San Diego from Seattle for our anniversary and had heard about Bombay from a friend that lived there. They said the food was amazing and they had belly dancers with snakes and fire....immediately we were in. We tried the chicken tandoori, aloo gobi, tikka masala and the rice....AMAZING! This was the best Indian food I have ever had...hands down! The service was fantastic as well. Ellie was our server and made sure that our dinner was perfect. Her attitude was fantastic and she was happy to recommend great dishes and drinks for us to try. We made sure that our dinner was during the entertainment and I was so happy that we did. The music was very cool and the belly dancer came by our table to let us hold her snake! The restaurant itself is beautiful.

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Very disappointing - won't go back.  Ordered the tandoori mixed grilled - basically all chicken - no mahi mahi (the waiter explained that they didn't have any fish at 6pm on a Saturday!.  No Indian beers!  Tried to order a Kingfisher beer or Taj Mahal and again told they didn't have any.  Food that we ordered was flavorless.  The lentils and lamb, one of their speciality dishes, tasted like someone opened a can of lentils and poured it over a few chunks of lamb.  I must say that the lamb was tender.  Service was lack luster.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80d953583b404cc1:0x431258fe6de690a6</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>First warning is don't go by it's ambience it's so deceiving. They have not given so much importance to food as they gave for the look. The food was awful and so expensive. I ordered aloo paratha and onion kulcha and felt I messed up with my dinner. I felt they used some frozen parathas which we get at Indian stores here. I was so disappointed with the dinner.

< Review>
First impression, "wow." The interior of the resturant is beautiful with ceiling waterfall and many decorative pieces, such as statues and gas lit lamps, with an exotic dancer.
First impression of the waitor, "she's really nice and humble." Gave good recommendations and was so sweet.
BUT THE SERVICE, THO
Unlike the lamps, it was not lit. We waited a little over an hour for our food. As we sat there hungry we saw people getting served left and right. If I were alone I would have got up and left to hit the nearest Denny's, but since it was girls' night out I stayed. The problem was, they forgot about us and we didn't get a free appetizer, dessert, nor did we get a discount. The waitor apologize and explained honestly that the servers never came out, forgetting about us. The food was warm, and we were disappointed.
As we proceed to check out we waited an extra 20 minutes just to pay for our bill.
Never coming back. Not bom(bay) at all.< /Review>

Buffet is the way to go. Plenty of good options, tikka masala is tasty, naan is flavorful, and if you get lucky they may have coconut crusted cauliflower!  Best value by far</review>

What immediately drew my attention was the $9.95 lunch special, which was posted outside of the entrance.  When I came in, I was immediately greeted and shown to my table.  The waiters were very courteous and offered different types of naan bread - I recall a spicy, garlic, and plain naan bread.  After choosing my bread, I made way to the buffet.  One section had the salads, the middle section had the different types of soups and curry (lentil soup, banana curry, eggplant, chicken tiki masala, vegetables to name a few), and then the desserts.

Everything tasted pretty good and for $9.95, definitely worth the trip.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

When we walked in the door we were meeted by one of the servers. He asked  us what type of nan we would like, and said it would be out shortly. The nan didn't come till after  we were done eating our main courses from the buffet. Also some of the chicken in the chicken tikka masala was partially raw. The food was also mediocre therefor I rated this restaurant 1 star.<//review>

< Review>
I ate at Bombay last night and can't believe they are trying to defend themselves with this nonsense (comment from 9/19/10).  Instead of posting comments claiming the bad reviews are lies, I suggest you go eat some of your food.  Chicken tikka masala that is dry!  I don't know how you can even do that!  Hard dry chunks of chicken in a flavorless tomato sauce.  The seeka kabobs, allo gobi and nan were OK but the prices are way too high for so/so to bad food.  On the flip side the decor in the new restaurant is amazing.  Now turn off your computer and go work on your food because I'll be trying the place across the street before I step food in Bombay again.  And I also agree with the earlier comment, Black Mtn Rd Indian restaurants are all much better (I'll take food over decor any day.)<//Review>

<review>Ordered food for delivery and nearly took two hours to arrive. On top of that it was cold.

When we contacted the restaurant the next day, they refused to refund us or give us a discount for future times.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80d953583b404cc1:0x431258fe6de690a6< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I arrive at this marvelous  place every couple of days  as I enjoy the special air that is unique to this place. The personel is highly welcoming and skilfull. The service is very quick. Needless to say, the food they cook is great. I frequent many times and I was always pleased. The payment is honest. I recommend this place to my friends and family.</Review>

Not to mention the man serving is stingy with the food compared to the lady she serves your plate to the point where the plate doesn't close right. For my luck I always get the man. Other than that the food is great.</Review>< rating>

Very clean, very nice staff, and the food is delicious and freshly cooked. I'm walking over there right now I'm lucky I live a few blocks away.</text>

GREAT food, but I felt the need to give it three stars because of the stares I got from those horrid Asian ladies. They rush you so hard they forget to put the side of terayaki sauce in the bag. They're lucky their food tastes so good or my mood for the rest of the day would've ruined everyone else.</review>

Couldn’t agree more with Carina Lopez’s review. The food is good that’s that.. but the ladies that serve you are gonna look at you like you owe them something. Those ladies are downright animals. Not to mention the way they treat their employees as last class people. CASH ONLY these people are still operating in 2003..</text>

The food was delicious!! I ordered the shrimp chop suey and it was very flavorful. Neat open airy place.

Con; Cash only. But they do have an ATM on site.<//Review>

The food is good, but what bothered me was the way the ladies were treating the employees.
Its been more than once that I've witnessed that. There's no reason to talk down at them and yell for no reason.</Review>

This place does not want business, I came in there to see if I can get my nails shorter and a different style and they couldn’t do it they want me to pay for for sat just to get my nails shorter and a different style! Apparently they don’t want business of any type and I’m not paying for a faucet when I already got a faucet I just need it done shorter it’s not that hard to do it short terrible customer service the girl who answered me is the one that’s closest to the door she is terrible bad customer service.I don’t usually rate people on anything but I’m gonna miss myself and when I came in there they’re very rude</Review>

Dirty equipment, they do not wash out the tubs where people put their feet in for pedicures. The only one I really like doing my nails is the owners teenage daughter, super friendly girl and pays attention to what she is doing...< /Text>

Not happy at all got my nails done on Saturday  they came out so ugly looked like flat web looking nails, my nails looked like they needed a fill already just after one day of getting my nails done. I went back the next day she said come back Tuesday. I went back today they made me wait along time she even stopped to eat. When she was fixing my nails you can see and I could feel she was doing it with hate I have so many cuts along my cuticles. I will never go back to this place then while I'm waiting, roaches  come out from under the dirty couch they have there ugh never again. This is what I got for going to get my nails done for cheap.< /Text>

<Text>I've been coming here to get my eyebrows/nails done for awhile now. It has ALWAYS been a specific price and just today they decide to up it a dollar...well I didn't have another dollar with me and had come prepared with what I always pay. The two women hassle me about a dollar and I tell them maybe next time to post a sign saying that they're upping their prices. I conclude to tell them I'll take my business elsewhere if that's how they want to be to a loyal customer who always pays in cash, like they want. Good luck with that greedy mentality, LA nails.. you won't be getting my business anymore and I've been a frequent and very loyal customer.

UPDATE!***

So yesterday I went to this nail shop to give them another shot (since I live .3 miles from them and it's convenient as hell) and two, my other nail place about a mile away,  was an hour wait. I just wanted a fill and my eyebrows waxed. Long story short, this was my last time coming here. For many reasons; the workers seem like they hate their jobs and don't give a damn about who comes and solicits their business. They charge for extra stuff... like a cut down (that he didn't technically do, he filed them down) and then change the eyebrow price once again. This time it was $7... last time it was $8, which caused the issue before. One last thing, the lady that did my eyebrows was intentionally rough at ripping the strips off and halfway laughed when I cried out in pain and surprise.

With all the nail shops around Colton/San Bernardino. This one needs to get with the times and realize we don't need them in our city, we choose to go there and expect a good experience with all the money we are spending to receive those services.<//Text><rating>1</rating>< gmap_id>

if i could i'd give them 0 stars. Firstly there was a cockroach roaming around the salon. Secondly I specially asked for no gel and they gave me gel. And lastly, they made most of my nails uneven and my cuticles look dry. I truly don't recommend this salon.< /text>

So this place is so unprofessional.. They left there cigarettes in the open where kids could grab them. A 30full set doesn't get a cuticle cut or a 5 min massage ...and I told her they were to long and she wouldn't even cut them down...stay away from this place.<//text>

<review>I had a very bad experience  yesterday with the lady who did my nails, she was so rude, she didn't  even give  time to chose the color,  I want, for my  feet I was looking for a brown and they don't  have any brown color, what it is cheap is more expensive  than paying  more,   she did am horrible job she was in a hurry with me to get more people, they charge 1.50 more to use your debit  card, when a peorson gets in she is so kind once  the person  is in she is just rude, I will never  go again  .< /review><Name>Virginia Manjarrez< /Name><user>110213315987111434586<//user>< time>

World of Smoke at 5 Corners in Atwater is AWESOME! They got a ton of glassware and pipes to choose from. This is where I got my infamous and huge glow in the dark glass bong with Veriglow Glass. I love that bong! A great place to shop for any and all smoking supplies!</Text>

<text>Best smoke shop in Merced County. Friendly. Tons of products, lots of variety, if you can't find it here chances are you won't find it anywhere close to home and will have to order online if they're not able to order it for you.<//text>< date>

They don't have gift cards not even for xmas, im almost 60 years old I dont know what my nephew needs exactly and the last time i went there the employees kept their eyes glued on me like i was gon steal from them. With that in mind I'll go to Target and he can get something else!</Review>

STELLAR SMOKE SHOP!!  The finest brand(s) of Glassware in Atwater hands down.  Possibly Merced Co. No kidding.
They also have a wide assortment of  smoke related items. As well as clothing, backpacks, hats, beanies, snacks, sodas power drinks, incense, lighters, etc.
It's defintley worth a "stop and see."
The staff is courteous and considerate.
"World of Smoke"💯👏😊< /Review>

We came to this spot for a meeting. we heard about this spot from quite a few people.  Well, it was very nice. The staff members were very polite and we had a great feeling. The meal was delicious. We loved this spot very much and we will definitely return to this restaurant. Warmly recommended.<//review>

Place is very clean and had a little bit of everything. I was looking to buy more CBD oil and the guy who waited on me was very informative. Very nice and polite. I highly recommend this place< /Text>

<Review>I created his Instagram for him and he promised good deals and gifts if I did it and now he's very rude to me and my boyfriend. Not very good customer service. GS smoke shop is the bomb. Gs smoke show has good deals and always lowering the prices the more I go there.</Review>< Pics>

Wish I stuck with my original, a small smok mod that was perfect for a beginner, but I upgraded to the G-Priv 2 Luxe edition. I like it but think it's more than what I was looking for, plus it's much cheaper online. Coils burnt quickly too. The guys there are nice but don't really know much about what they sell.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Best vape shop in Atwater which isn't saying much. They have a decent selection and most things are in stock most of the time but they are popular so it makes sense that they'd run out of something but usually they'll have it in the next day or so. As for the prices, well, it's typical of vape shops to be way over priced compared to online and this one is no different. The main dude that works most of the time is cool but his little helper is an angry little man with an attitude who has absolutely zero knowledge about any of the products they sell. If you don't believe me just go in there and ask him a question about anything that you already know the answer to and you will either ask the main guy who usually knows or he'll give you some bogus response half the time. For example if you're looking for a coil for your atomizer (it better be smok or compatible with baby beast or prince cuz that's all they have) he seems to think they are all universally compatible. If you don't need whatever you're trying to buy immediately it's best to just shop online and save your money.<//review>

< Review>
Wonderful church! Very welcoming and friendly environment. Something for everyone. The pastor is a great preacher and is very down to Earth. We travel a lot due to work, so we've visited over a hundred churches. This one is one of my top 5. Please give it a try!</Review>

God is doing great things at Liberty. The church is so friendly!
Pastor Thomson brings a well balanced biblical message Sunday morning, evening and Wednesday night. The gospel is central in the messages. Typically Sunday mornings have a series that's very practical for the believer. Pastor is a very good bible teacher. He uses relevant illustrations, quotes, visuals and humor to keep you engaged and to help you understand the Word.
Worship is a balance of songs and hymns that are engaging and fresh. The choir is growing. Singing specials are very well done and allow many more members than just the choir to sing and bless the church.
The connection groups for college students on Sunday morning (Sunday school) have that small group, everyone can share, intimate feeling, yet are still structured.
One-on-one discipleship is also a great way to sit down and learn from another Christian about the Bible and to build relationships. It is very much encouraged for you to read the Word on your own, rather than just receive what a man says. There is a careful balance of seeking knowledge and having a heart relationship with God and here you'll find you can grow in both.
There are many opportunities to serve and get involved in a ministry that reaches people with the gospel.
The graphic design and visuals are all very high end and professional.
There is also a large growing Spanish ministry.
I am a student at UCI and there is a good singles/college group at the church campus, though a presence on college campus would be helpful.< /text>

My husband and I have been attending Liberty Baptist Church for almost 15 years.  We moved here to take care of my husband's Dad who was a retired Lutheran pastor.  Because we couldn't leave him home alone, he began coming to church with us and fell in love with the people and they with him.   Through the years, we've seen our church grow and move forward for the cause of Christ.  This is our family and we love the people and know we are loved in return.  If you are looking for a place that preaches Christ and Him alone, this is the place for you!  Blessings and joy in serving the King of kings and Lord of lords in Southern California.<//text>

Let me just say that the one thing that stands out about this church is the friendly spirit. It doesn't matter who you are or what background you came from, you will feel loved and at home! They strive to keep God Almighty first and teach His people and others about the gospel!</Text>

<Review>Liberty Baptist Church is a wonderful church to attend. The children's service is well planned and super fun. As a child (specifically Enrich) services are fun to attend. My family and I have been attending for 2 years now, yet we still love the church. Great church :)<//Review>< pics>

Liberty Baptist Church made me feel like family with such a warm welcoming the first time I attended.  The sermon, the music, and fellowship starts my week off with joy in my heart and biblical  principles to face the challenges of the week.  You can be assured that Christ is first and foremost the focus at Liberty Baptist Church</Text>

I am so thankful for Liberty Baptist Church. A few months ago, under the Lord's leading, we decided to make Liberty Baptist Church our home. We are so glad we did! The music is inspiring and the preaching is trememdous. Pastor Thompson is a true shepherd and his heart beats for God. Pastor Scott has a true gift in leading the singing to helps prepare us for the preaching. If you are looking for a warm, friendly, inspiring church, then I ask you to consider coming to Liberty Baptist Church of Newport Beach, CA. You will not be disappointed.< /text>

Our family loves Liberty Baptist Church. We have been attending LBC for about 18 years. Pastor Thompson preaches from the Word of God and loves the people. The people are friendly and care about others. They are a wonderful church family.</Review>

Liberty has been the church home for my family for almost 10 years and we could not have been more blessed to attend this church. We love the people, the programs but most importantly the fact that The Word of God is being preached here every week.</text>

<text>This church is like having a large extended family.  The people are real and they care for each other.  There is something for everyone and the preaching is always from the Bible.  If you want to learn the Bible and grow as a Christian then this is the right place for you.<//text>< Pictures>

I love this place and I have absolutely no complaints about it. It is much nicer than any other 24 Hour Fitness I have ever been to. I do not think that some of the other reviews are fair. I want Marcy B. to know that the front desk "drones" are people just like you... and apparently more personable than you are.< /Review>

<text>I loved the indoor pool! The shower in the pool is warm. Just don't take too long in the shower as it will get hot. The lifeguards are super friendly and they a such a support. I hope anyone who visits here says hello to the person in the front because they deserve the friendliest greetings as to being at the pool for so long. Hope you guys enjoy the pool as much as I did!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2c5b62a859c65:0x4e2f89a91f90e574</gmapID></record>

My kids have been coming here for the past 11 years the Pool always have been clean and sanitized. The best of all that my children established good friendship with the lifeguards as with a teammate or people that goes to the pool thank you to Richard Alatorre my kids had learn a lot from there. Thank you to the lifeguards and to the coaches that have done a great job.< /Review>

Great place to swim with the little ones.   Early afternoon is great.. Nobody at all in the pool but me and my little ones.   Come one, come all... The staff is awsome and great.     Only thing is that this pool opens at
12:30pm so no early bird swimming< /review>

< Review>
My kids and I went yesterday I love this pool its great. I've been coming here since a kid myself the prices are 4$ per adult WOW right! Anyways my kids got a rash from the pool I strongly believe its because this pool uses way to much chlorine as soon As you step in there you can smell it it's very strong they should use a bit less, but overall the experience was great the water is nice and cold but the chlorine smell was strong they should definitely try putting less.... Downey pool uses less chlorine just saying< /Review>

I use this pool for adult lap swimming. Busy during the summer while students are out on vacation but relatively relaxed during the school year during adult lap swim hours (except for Fridays, which are busy).

Purchase a lap pass for ~$80 and you get 30 visits at a discounted price vs paying each time. The pool is (relatively) clean and the showers are warm enough.</review>

Fixed the pigeon problem. At least they run the lane lines 25 meter across, rather than 20 meter. Warm water, lots of little kids showering (in case you're modest). Attendants very nice.<//Review>

It saved my life with the new rule of one person per child in the pool cause one time I was there I had an emergency happen and I had to take my wife for my granddaughter cousin can go so there was someone else there to watch out for the kids safety.</Review>

(Translated by Google) There to go for the kids to have a happy time and that's what I did look and found this pool and take my daughter with my nephews and sister and there we spent the afternoon playing and swimming but most importantly we spent some time in family so you also go and have a nice time with your loved ones ok 👌

<user>105767527579404832362<//user><review>This Vons does not follow the CDC or the CDPH guidelines regarding wearing a mask. I was at the store yesterday around 7:43pm and I was checking out with Rosabel who was just great. However the young man at the bagging section immediately demanded me to wear a mask. He was extremely irate and very adamant I wear this cloth mask. I explained how I was vaccinated and the fact that I have a serious medical condition and am exempt. He still disregarded my medical condition and I explained I have severe asthma and wearing a mask can cause serious damage to my health and I am medically exempt from any mask mandate. He insisted all his friends with asthma still wear a mask. Now we are entering discrimination to someone with a disability since I also suffer from a mental health disability.

I have two different legal grounds that enforce any business to comply with my medical condition. To discriminate, harass and belittle my medical condition as an employee of Vons I need the general manager to contact me immediately. Also, this gentleman threatened me to never come back. I must make aware my cashier was completely fine with me not wearing a mask while she had her mask on behind a large piece of plastic. Someone needs to reach me ASAP to discuss ramifications internally before I have to move this into a legal matter which fortunately I have all documented via body cam video.</review>< Rating>

A nice grocery store with a decent deli and nice produce. I was looking for egg roll wrappers and had some trouble finding them, but I asked the lady at the customer service counter and she lead me right to them. It was around 11am and everyone was very busy stocking the shelves and it's good to know that they put fresh items out regularly.  Thumbs up!<//review>

<review>Got my first vaccine and the pharmacy  staff from the lady who checked me in, to the pharmacist administering this shot were very soothing, for lack of a better word. I was nervous when I got there but by the end of the 15 minute waiting period I was as relaxed as if it never happened.

I appreciated the way they treated me and the others in my vaccine group. I saw for the first time how important these people are and how lucky Von's is to have them working at their store.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>The store itself is okay. What I was really impressed with was Miram in the bakery. She was very sweet and pleasant.  We were late getting in a cake order in for my sons birthday.  She made it happen. Was super nice about it. The cake was great. All around great customer service< /Review>< pics>

Used to be better. Now they have replaced stuff that you see at a gas station but for more of an expensive price.<//Review>

<review>Vons provide very special foods. Make efforts to delivery them even to our homes. This is convenient during the Coronavirus Pandemic. Those whom are under lockdown or quarantine. The elderlies and disabled are extended more services from discounted bus passes to helping customers to there cars. We all appreciate Vons for what they do so well in Santa Ana other major locations. Their store is very well presented. Blessed with purchases. The restrooms are welcoming clean. There is so much to Vons from Deli and wine sections. Where special foods are delivered in a special way. That is Vons daily. When customers want the best come here. Starbucks and Wells Fargo, there is nothing Vons does not seem to have. I just came in for milk.</review>< Rate>

This store has a lot of things and it's really well stocked all the time. I like it because it's kept clean and the bathrooms are kept really well also. The people that work there seem to be pretty pretty friendly and knowledgeable as well. It's got a great location with other shopping centers around it.< /Review>

Everything that I needed was on the shelves even the antibacterial pop-up hand wipes.  Quite expensive I think comparatively to prior to covid-19 which is the way it is.<//review>

Closest grocery store to home so we go here, but there is usually always a line at anytime of the day. No self-checkout lanes to help speed things up either!

The produce department is lacking compared to other grocery stores, but the hot foods section has really friendly workers and they try to be as fast and efficient as possible.

Cool that there is a Starbucks located inside this store.< /text>

<Text>My favorite grocery store chain. From farm fresh fruits and vegetables, to oven baked bread, pastries and donuts, there's even an abundance of plants and flowers, not to mention an amazing selection of wine and craft beers. It's truly a one-stop-shop.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Well, it's my tenth day living in Santa Ana and my son dropped me off at Von's.  I was leery to walk back home in the dark but the people and cashiers and other employees of my favorite grocery store made me feel right at home again.  Grocery shopping is important to every man, woman and child.  I go to Von's because I know I can count on fresh produce, a wonderful bakery and clean aisles full ofquality food.  Thanks, Vons!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>I like shopping at Vons  because of their selection and freshness, but I don’t like shopping where the out side doesn’t match the in side corporate needs to step in and do something about the appearance specifically round the front door enternece seriously the walls and floor need  to be power washed it’s nasty with grime  doo dirty .

Also it would make sense  to play music in the store for ambiance or at least  Vons commercials

Maybe digital TVs in as well make it cool and exciting place to shop<//review>< user>

If they could just take pricing down a little, I know it would make me feel better. So by now you get it: Good place to get groceries, but it will cost you. Get their member card. It does save.< /Text>

<text>Won the $5 gift card twice on the Monopoly game so far! Thanks Vons. The prices are more competitive now that Vons and Albertsons merged. I really watch the sales. Just spent $60 but with sales, Just for U Vons app and coupons,  I saved $33. That's more than 50% off! Nice to see great quality with good prices.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

It is a nice store extensive floral section.BEST part of the whole store is their awesome produce self watering system. AND  a BIG shout out to our cashier Rodney Robertson of the Long Beach Vons on Ximeno. Rodney is professional and kind.  I give this Vons two thumbs up!</Text>

It's tasty and very crunchy. They also do freshly made sandwich and hot soup for take away. This grocery supermarket has it all. Their produce is very fresh and price is reasonable.

I had visited about 1 month ago. There was a child in front, selling candies. Very sweet young man. I witnessed a heavy set supposed security officer lure the child over, brandishing a $20 bill, the child ran over to him, the security officer, sped away in his cart, laughing, proud of making a mockery of this is little boy. I hope this pathetic excuse of a security officer gets what is coming to him. He is lower than low and deserves to be fired.</text>

Pretty good Vons. A little bit of a backwards layout compared to what I'm used to, but it has everything I would expect!< /review>

Very expensive. Crowded. It's Southern California. If l were to compare it to Fry's in Arizona. I'd have to give it a one star. For SoCal it's exactly what you should expect.
For SoCal Smart and Final is your best bet for prices. We shopped here today only for a few items. I don't like the mark up. I would never make a habit of shopping at Vons. Try it one time and you will understand.< /review>

Ok so this is my favorite grocery store....such a big selection to choose from and the store is very nice....however the customer service counter is only open part of the day....I've waited over 20 minutes there with no one looking at me until finally someone tells me they aren't open.   They even close the counter for lunch....   They also close their deli too soon.  I went in on a Friday night to get some fried chicken and they were not making any more for the night....this was at like 5:30.< /text>

The young man who was working the Express lane was very lazy.  After being summoned to the express by another coworker he proceeded to tell me I was in the wrong lane since it was 15 items or less, I told him I was asked by another associate to enter his lane and should I leave.  He proceeded to check me thru but was not very friendly after the brief discussion</Text>

Disappointing trip to the nearest grocery store. I understand nobody wants to be working on NYE but wow. I asked employee and question and got a "don't bother me" attitude, I was taken back and I asked again. No I was correct, he could not be bothered. Customer service is lacking.<//text>

<Review>I like this store because the isles are wide and they carry Pet Fresh dog food which is the only kind of food my chihuahua will eat. Its a large store with a big wine section and a floral/gift section next to produce. They have stuff like succulents, air plant terrariums and candy bouquets. Also sells vases and ballons. Theres a Starbucks and Wells Fargo bank inside.  Actually they may have taken out the bank. But theres a Wells right across the street from there. Overall its a good store. But im only giving 4 stars because the front entrance into the store is dirty. They need to pressure wash the area where the carts are kept as well as the sidewalk. Its not a bus stop, its a grocery store. Just sayin....<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I moved to this area 4 months ago and people have mentioned this place to me but I never went. In an attempt to make a home made kale salad I needed to find bunches of kale that were not pre cut and bagged like trader Joe's and aldi have.
Well, I found everything I needed at vons. They have the best selection of organic and conventional vegetables in the area. This was surprising because you imagine trader joe's as a place to get healthy food but it's all processed and bagged up in plastic.
Before vons I was getting really disappointed with the quality of food in socal. I can now say vons is restoring my hope in this place.
After buying my kale bunches I went home, washed and cut the kale leaves myself. Then I made a delicious dressing. Also I found real balsamic vinegar at vons. Trader Joe's also has balsamic vinegar but it all has caramel food coloring in it.
Well because of vons I was able to get all the ingredients for my kale salad and then enjoy it for dinner.
Lastly something I've been searching for at all the stores, wholefoods, sprouts stores in the area for the last 4 months I found at vons. This is beef liver. If you need a source of beef liver vons is it.
Thanks,
Alex</review>

Place can get really crowded from 5:00 to 6:30. I wish they would get some self checkout kiosks. Other than that, good selection. Deli is good.<//review>

Pretty bad customer if not the worst in any supermarket  I've  been  to. It seems like cashiers are burdened to help you. The checkout is the slowest ever</text>

High prices and lack of cashiers. I only go here when I absolutely need to because it is so close to my house. The lines typically run back through the aisles and take 10-15 minutes to get through.<//Text>

<text>Large, clean and well staffed chain grocery store. Starbucks right inside too. A range of coin counting machines and Redbox. There is also a Wells Fargo full service mini branch with ATMs. It stays open later on the weekends then the big branch across the street! One thing that is listed as being at this store but isn't is the machine where you can sell a gift card for cash. I asked for this machine once and a staff member told me that the machine caused more problems than it solved so they had it removed.< /text>< Pics>

Always great deals.A very clean store with great employees to assist.If you need some gear and your a rams fan your in luck.One of the best things there is that they have a wells fargo inside that is open all 7 days so if you really need assistance with a teller here is the spot to exchange your check.There is a line always but it's always worth it when you max out on your atm withdraws whether you need the cash for any given emergency. Very friendly staff.They also have a Starbucks. What else can you possibly want???.< /review>

Vons is clean and has a decent selection of things. Although it isn't the most affordable of the nearby grocery stores it is definitely convenient.</text>

<Review>This Vons is terribly laid out and always has items in locations that are just frustratingly hard to find.  Employees sometimes don't even know where to find common items.  In addition, there are always long check out lines, no self check out, and there are often bums asking for money as you enter and exit the building.<//Review><Time>1484330608212< /Time>< pictures>

<Review>Not one of the best places to go grocery shopping. The stuff here is way too expensive and they don't maintain the grocery store to a certain standard. Everything just feels thrown around and unorganized. There are a ton of grocery stores that you can go to for a better prices and a better atmosphere.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

They say it's pricey but then u put a price on your health and quality of food but then they say you are what you eat so in that since the price is fair I will pay a premium to live premium  this store is amazing fast service amazing selection unrivalled in my personal opinion I hope walmarW doesn't take out Vons to because we will be left with trash to eat and feed our families thank you Vons< /Review>

DON'T EVER ORDER A GENDER REVEAL CAKE, my Daughter In Law ordered one and it was a disaster from the decor to the revealing of the gender. The Cake was not much of Cake, it was all icing and a small layer of cake. I mean we had to pick out the cake from the icing. The Cake was covered in icing too! Not much of a reveal the icing inside was mixed white and blue and it took my Daughter in-law tearing up the cake to finally get to the revealing of the gender. What a disappointment for her. From start to finish.
*Vons used to have the best cakes and NOW  THEY ARE THE WORST CAKES !< /review>

< review>
Was shopping at This Vons On a regular Basis until I started being harassed by One worker who would purposely do things to offend or insult me.
She for a whole year would roll her eyes at me walk away when bagging when It came to my turn lettering me know she does not like me enough to not want to pack my groceries but she purposely followed me to the register I was at once she realized i avoided her line she followed me and then still when it came to my turn she walked away smirking and rolling her eyes looking me up a down. At this point  I was like really really annoyed.  I was really uncomfortable and felt like she was purposely harassing me. Then the final straw for me was when you purposely went 4 cashiers down to were I was to come behind me in the line I was in to rudely shout well chuckling at the cashier well looking at me repeatedly asking and telling the cashier for a "Blue Bill in the house , is there a blue bill in the house?"   the cashier had no idea what she was referring too he had a lost annoyed face and tone he was getting frustrated because she made no sense to anyone of us standing there she finally walked away with a evil smirk on her face...but she hooverard me standing next to me insulting me laughing because ...what I was found is she was calling  me a Nazi!    look it up its a in the Urban Dictionary.  So it bothered me so much I called the manager a few days later I think it was...the manager acted like he cared but did nothing cause all the guys including  the manager all look like they have crushes on her so they all  with lie for her.  I finally stop shopping at Vons and I will never ever view them the same after they did nothing to remove this racist employee.  Ohhhh....I almost forgot...this...
So scratches started appearing on mt girlfriends car so my gf started going in the market without me  because  the employee made me feel of uncomfortable so the first time this happened the employee always see me and my gf always shopped together we were never without one another so the one day she went in by herself the employee assume I was with her in the store but indeed I was not and I was in the car with tinted windows up...she came out the grocery store doors I noticed she was looking around for our car because their were no carts to be collected around our car...so I ducked I hit so she could not see me she walked out of her way in between cars to to the side of our car looked around like she was going to do something and then she saw my face from the front windshield and her face turned so pale and then red she was shocked I caught her she immediately turned around a walked away trying to be calm...she disappeared from the store for about 3 months and then she was back ....I immediately made the call after that day and demanded it be looked in to and she be fired but 3 months and she was back . I stopped shopping at VONS there were they are racist and protect racists.
I swear to god on everything I love I'm telling the truth and even leaving some more incidences out but seriously all of Santa Ana is pretty much racist against whites.<//review>

<review>Unnecessary waiting in line... as a business you should know when your heavy traffic hours are and adjust accordingly.

Bread or milk shouldn't expire before the date. Once, sure I can get that, but more than twice... no thank you!

The highlights are the deals in the butcher department.<//review>< Pics>

I like this store it's typically clean and I can find everything I need. The only thing I have experienced time and time again with this store is the painfully slow between the slow checkouts and long long lines. If they could get that down I'd be shopping there more for sure. Honestly, I'd rather deal with Costco or Trader Joe's since it's usually an in and out operation at TJ's<//text>

<text>i don't shop here often, it's not near home. I come here on occasion when I visit my girl friends house. Every time i shop here there are maybe 2 lines open but enough people in line to have 4 lines open. If vons is trying to cut back on employee cost by under staffing, then they need to add self serve machines.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><time>1544593661236< /time></record></dataset><record>

12:52 and they locked the doors. So much for closing at 1am. And it was literally going to take me 2-3 minutes tops, to get what I needed. This is not acceptable.<//Review>
