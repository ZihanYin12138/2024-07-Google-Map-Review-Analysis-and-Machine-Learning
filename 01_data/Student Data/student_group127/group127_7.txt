Tucked away on a busy corner. Today at 1:15, it was relatively quiet. I've seen it really busy, though. It's what you can expect from a Subway. Standard quality and ingredients, no frills customer service - the sandwich maker made my sandwich, rang me up - but it's a sandwich place, not Neiman Marcus, so right on.< /text>

<Text>I love this location, the staff is always very friendly, and helpful. The one thing I will say about this location is it is next to a light rail station, and sometimes you will get people begging you for money in the parking lot, but if you kindly tell them no, its usually not an issue.< /Text><gmapID>0x809ada93c3c44de5:0xba3da3f1d9366e25< /gmapID><user_id>107865350982579475897<//user_id>< name>

Food is good, but the girl that is working there most of the time isn't very hygenic. She's always touching her face and unsanitary surfaces with the same gloves she's making sandwiches with and doesn't wash her hands<//text>

Ok so I wanted a quick bite the other day  and thought I'd try there breakfast sandwich. Me and my friend go to see if they were open.. it was about 945-50 at the time, the open sign wasn't on but the door was open. We walk in and a short Indian girl with glasses tells us to come back in 10 minutes. Ok no big deal but why was the door open? So we come back and she's still not all the way set up , the open sign wasn't on and she hardly spoke. It was really quiet inside the store and the employee didn't really communicate with me and my friend. The cookies were all out right near the register and when we went to pay for our food she ends up forgetting the cash register and goes into the walk-in and brings it out! My friend jokes about it being "cold cash" or coins  the employee laughed too . But really?? How are you not going to be set up when it's time for you to open?? I'm not sure if she was new or what but it was a bit ridiculous. I believe most subways are individuallly owned and operated so maybe that's why. I just had a so so experience. The egg breakfast sandwich wasn't that good in my opinion, my Friend liked his tho.<//Review>

<text>One of the worst. I work within walking distance and would rather drive to another subway. The bread is stale. The sandwich is assembled sloppily. I ordered pickles and they were all piled at one end. They start putting lettuce on before asking if I want it. (I don't). Overall, just a poorly run location, with homeless people gathered outside begging for money.</text>< Pictures>

Went to get my fountain drink couldn't help but wonder when it was cleaned last as black mold was in my cup not once but twice. Never again I tell ya definitely won't be going back.</text>< rating>

This subway served me cold soup. Not to mention it stinks like they have been using the same mop since they opened. I tried talking to the manager, but he/she never seems to be there. Trust these people when they say, "Don't spend your money there ".</review>

<Text>If I could give zero stars I definelty would! This is the MOST ABSOLUTE worse subway I've ever been to!!! I was waiting st the light rail being said that I had  wanted a quick bite before work and it was 105 degrees, I go in with my bike and There was only one person. No one greeted me or anything and I knew someone was in the back. I was on the verge of passing out, I asked May I please have some water and the young man ignored me. After I actually politely waited , he asked the lady if he can give me water ! And the lady seen how exhausted I was! He then goes to tell me it would have to be tap water! The oven looks dirty , I was going to purchase food anyway but being treated as if I was a nobody I would never purchase anything from here. This is the second time I've had this type of interaction. Before I had gone in for a speacial and was chargd for everything separately! Never come here! Everything is old anyway!!</Text><GmapID>0x809ada93c3c44de5:0xba3da3f1d9366e25</GmapID>< Pics>

After a few minutes of the employees just talking with each other, one of them (Mercedes) finally asks me if I'd like a sandwich. No I'm just standing here because I like the smell.
After she made my sandwich she didn't ask me if I wanted any sauces and started packing my sandwich like she was in a hurry, there was no one behind me!!! I had to mention to her that I'd like mayo and chipotle sauce after the sandwich was halfway wrapped. Horrendous service.

<review>The people who work their seem to have a problem with some of their paying customers...mainly the homeless, I have seen one of them look at my homeless friends and he gets this look of disgust...where's the politeness and half smile u give the ones who live in a home sheltered....a customer who pays is a paying customer no matter what culture they come from...<//review>< Pictures>

Pretty solid experience overall. Food was very good and tasted awesome! The service was quick and we didn't have to wait long to have our order taken and to receive our food. Ambience of the place is super chill and mellow and all the decor was dope. On the flip side though I had to ask 5 times to get my water but all our other drinks came out very quickly so I'm not really sure what was up with that. Another star docked for the water too because I never received a refill but other than that, I really enjoyed my experience here and will be coming again.< /Review>

<Review>Visited a few months ago and never got around to writing a review. Service was extremely slow and we were the only patrons when they opened for dinner on a Saturday. Food was delicious, but both mine and my husband's plates had hair in them. We waited 15 minutes for the check after we asked for it. Too bad, it tasted really great before the dread of hair in food set in.</Review><gmapID>0x8085257778687b67:0x5328a2310b158168</gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp><user>102373762011410271214<//user></record>

< Review>
They have messed up my orders twice and didn’t even try to compensate or try to apologize about it. They made the food poorly and it didn’t even have flavor to it either. They usually do a good job but have been slacking lately, it’s just very disappointing and they have definitely lost a customer. And their customer service definitely needs work, a lot of the toppings that go on the food wasn’t even there. It’s just poor service in general and multiple times now.<//Review>

Very authentic Thai in quaint little Dixon.  Delicious, spicy food!  The restaurant is nicely decorated, the food is fresh and the service is very courteous.  Follow up the spicy meal with Thai iced tea to cool off.  Highly recommended!</review>

Having lived and taught in Thailand for a year, I’m pretty picky about Thai food and this place gets 5 stars. From the curries to the cashew chicken, the pad see ew to the som tam, everything is so so good! 100% recommend to all who enjoy excellent Thai!< /text>

< review>
One may be wary about a restaurant serving two styles of food (in this case Thai and Sushi) and rightfully so BUT at Bangkok Garden I've found that both types of cuisine are Superior to many places that specialize in only one or the other. The service is friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere clean, cool, with varied seating types to Foster different dining experiences. Definitely worth a try!!!< /review>

<user_name>Stephen Newcomb< /user_name><review>Thai food is serviceable, but the sushi is horrendous. They recently replaced their sushi chef and the quality of their fish immediately dropped by an appalling amount. Rolls have excessive rice, small amounts of fish, and the fish that is there tastes very old. When I called to inform them of this, they did not offer me a refund of any kind. I will never eat here again.<//review><GmapID>0x8085257778687b67:0x5328a2310b158168<//GmapID><rating>1< /rating><Resp>None</Resp><Date>1515142126730</Date>< userid>

< Review>
Good food at a good price. If you're familiar with Sohpia's Thai Food and Bar in Davis, you'll feel right at home here (and with a few extra bucks in your pocket!). The red curry, Pad Thai, sushi pizza ($6 of fried ricey goodness, worth a try), and Thai iced tea tasted as authentic as I've had. Definitely a good addition to the restaurant scene in Dixon!<//Review>

Service was terrible...
The poor waitress was by her self to take orders, serve, an bus tables.
We will not be going back
Waiting  30-40 minutes for water an placing an order is ridiculous.< /Text>

This is our current favorite Thai restaurant in the area - it beats any of the places in Davis.  The prices are reasonable and the food is well presented and YUMMY.< /text>

Horrible customer service. Food was mediocre. Sushi chef at the bar spent more time conversing with friends then worring about the 2 tables they had waiting. Took 45-50min to get food after waiting 20-30 min just to place order< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>This hometown fair is just that "Home" This is my absolute favorite fair !
This year I found myself stranded due to a mysteriously dead battery in my pickup. I'm not just talking one battery but my truck has two !
I asked Jim, the Director of the Fairgrounds, for his help in jump starting my pickup after having failed attempt with friends participating in Rodeo.
Jim sent one of his workers who came to my rescue with his own vehicle, another failed attempt, so this guy grabbed his friend with his own vehicle who then attempted to get me rolling with both vehicles jump starting both my batteries at same time .
That's loyalty people !
A BIG shout out to my new friends at the Mendocino Fair & Apple Show!
And even BIGGER shout out to the local tow truck driver from Star's Automotive who went the extra mile to get me two brand new batteries to get me back up and running !
THANK YOU BOB, ( Star's Automotive ) for all you did to get my rigg going again !  You'll hold a special place in my heart !< /text><user_name>Toni Hoag< /user_name><Gmap_id>0x80816a3be37ab531:0x82debeae27a36b92</Gmap_id>< Time>

<rating>5</rating><text>I visited for work for two nights and wish I could have stayed longer. Dolly, the camp host, was among the friendliest types of people that you might come across on your travels. She was very knowledgeable and helped provide my coworker and I with the ins and outs of RV maintenance and good practice. It was really nice to get the information as new RV owners. The site was quiet and low key, and the weather was beautiful for our visit. The bathrooms were pretty clean and the showers were clean and worked well. Would recommend.<//text>< username>

I never expected 2 leather clad bikers could be so welcome as when we turned up, the locals were all so friendly and even put our helmets and jackets safe for us
The fair itself is great, exactly like they used to be, wild rides for the kids and various treats to try for the grown ups
Good to see the Medical Services were on site, 2015 it was mid 90'f and they were needed<//review>

It has showers! That is a huge plus if you are camping. Horse stalls could use some work. Overall not bad.</text>

I visit this outstanding restaurant from time to time since I like the  special atmosphere that is exist in this place. The crew is extremely cordial and qualified. The service is extraordinarily rapid. Needless to say, the food they cook is magnificent. I frequent many times and I was always delighted. The expense is honest. I highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.< /text>

This was our first time, so we tried several items- The lamb wrap was filled with flavorful flame cooked chunks. The tasty chicken kabob came with fluffy, separate rice, a salad and hummus.  We tried the borscht, which was brothy but delicious, and the potato piroshki that had a tender sweet authentic pastry. We topped it off with the walnut cake that was dense, full of walnuts, and not overly sweet. -all at a very good value. It is located kitty corner from Target. We are so happy to find this gem!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Excellent food, and service; if you like Greek, Syrian, or Iraqi style gyros, rice, and meat i think this place will be a good fit for you. I will definitely be back but with a bigger appetite this time.</Review>

Great family owned restaurant in an easy to find shopping center,  we have enjoyed the food and the services, it's always fresh and clean here and the prices are reasonable.  Highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood for Mediterranean cuisine. Enjoy</review>

Had a nice lunch there today and came once before. Both times it was yummy and not too heavy, a nice balanced meal. I really like their salmon and grilled veggies. It’s delicious and I love the hospitality each time we’ve visited. THANK YOU! Will be coming back for sure :)< /Review>

Went in to order take out. The staff was very friendly and very helpful explaining their menu. They made several recommendations and we went with the kebab burritos. Our dinner was delicious and portions were very big. I would definitely recommend trying them out. We will definitely be returning!!< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I love Mediterranean style food and I love this place! When I discovered this restaurant Pre-COVID, it became impossible for me to not eat here 1-2x/week. Even with all of the curve balls COVID has thrown at small businesses and restaurants the AGH is still standing and their food is as fantastic as ever. This is a family owned Armenian food jewel that everyone should discover. The menu has something for everyone. I still order out weekly. The food is made fresh on the spot from real ingredients, and flavored with real spices. Its important that I, my family, friends and patients eat for health, without losing taste. I can't recommend this place enough. Try the borscht!

Ordered to pick-up using Yelp; very smooth and the order was ready when I got to the restaurant. (I noticed the place was very busy, which is a good sign.) Ordered two falafel wraps. They were exquisite! Chock full of fresh everything and wonderfully tasty. Even the tzatziki was excellent! Thoroughly enjoyable; I'll be back.<//text>

Wanted to check this place out for awhile. It's right across from Birdcage Target and the menu looked like what I would love. We went on Friday night. It was not busy. Order at the counter then they bring the food to your table. Our Food was very flavorful. I give it 5 stars. Service was 4 stars but it is the ambiance that was the downfall. I felt like I was in a fish bowl. The fluorescence lights in the office style T Bar ceiling in combination with a wall of windows next to our table gave us an uncomfortable dining experience. I would go back for lunch but not at night. It's too bad because the food is great.
I recommend for lunch</Review>

This place is a very great local Armenian/Mediterranean eatery. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and the portions are very filling. And the potato Pieroshki(?) Is a wonderful side</Text>

<Text>Tasty! I wish I hadn't waited so long to try them out. We had chicken and lamb chops. Both entrees included flat bread, salad and rice, and due to quantity, neither of us could clean our plates. The baba ganoush was good too. Try them out and help a small business.<//Text>< Pictures>

Really wonderful service. The gentlemen who helped us this evening was very knowledgeable about their items, and helped us to pick just the right food. I ordered the chicken breast plate with veggies and salad and my partner got the chicken wrap. Both were outstanding. I highly reccomend both for quality food and service!</text>

Never had Armenian food in my whole life and tried it the first time yesterday and let me tell you what. It was bomb! I recommend if anyone likes chicken with rice, this place has it. The chicken breast is cooked and seasoned well if I were to rate it I'll give it a 10/10</Review>

This place has the best falafel.  I don't know what they do to it, but it's addicting. Crispy exterior with a moist interior.  It's a miracle! They do the falafel wrap, as a meal crushed over rice with a salad,  hummus,  and pita.  They also have the best fries ever.  They are a little on the thin side with a crispy exterior, yum.  I'm hoping to try the kabobs, if I can ever pull myself away from the falafel.</review>

Delicious & healthy food, nice vegetarian options, reasonable prices, dessert cakes taste home-made & very yummy. Good costumer service when I picked up my to-go order, seems very clean, and staff was wearing masks. Only complaint... I wish they used compostable or reusable take-out containers instead of styrofoam.<//Text>

I've gone here a few times and it's always been good, but they added a kebab burger and it's amazing. Very tasty. Armenian food is a little less garlicky than Mediterranean, which I definitely didn't mind.< /review>

<Text>I came here for the gyro but decided to try an entree also. Rice was to wet and soft, tri tip was just salt and pepper, tough to chew with gristle from untrimmed meat, and the pita bread was not fresh.
Beef gyro was over sauced with Italian dressing and pickled peppers which also included gristle from the beef. Not one single part of the gyro didn't have too much dressing/too much vinegar taste. Overall, it was the worst gyro I ever had and won't return. Why is it so hard to find good eats in Citrus Heights!? Definitely pride missing in the food.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfsqnZCI21vImSWhZuyo7vfmtjXZZh5MX1e26_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

** Spectacular Place AND Food **
I stopped by while working. Ordered a burger and fries.
~Yes They Serve Burgers Now~
Burger was delicious. I couldn't get enough of it but it's filling.
I go out all the time and this is the best burger in town.
I tried many of the entries before; wraps, kabob, lamb chops, ect.. and loved it all.
Will be back!
My recommendation is try it. You won't regret it. You'll be back as well.
Heard They Do Catering, need to try that still.< /Review>

<Text>We recently moved to the area, but we've lived all over the country and we're always looking for good Mediterranean food. This place ranks up there as one of our favorites. We had the chicken and lamb wraps, Greek fries, and borscht (yes they have borscht on the menu!). The food was fresh and delicious, and the borscht (beet and cabbage soup) was to die for; not quite as good as grandma's, but excellent. Good prices for the amount of food you get, and fresh hummus and pita as an appetizer. Not to mention the wall of Armenian attractions and history cards on the table are pretty cool. Very friendly staff and the gracious owner took time to talk to us about his future plans for the restaurant. We are definitely coming back.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I had a gift certificate so while I don’t live out in a Citrus Heights, I drove out anyway because I like restaurants that have Kabobs. I got the chicken kabob plate and a chicken gyro(forgive me if I misspelled it) for my husband. The young lady was kind over the phone when I called to place my order in advance. When I arrived, my food was ready to go and paying with the gift certificate was easy and stress free. I love when restaurants keep their staff trained on all forms of payment. I had a little anxiety driving the almost 30 minutes to that restaurant because I wasn’t sure if they’d know how to use the gc or tell me I had to pay another way. I think most of us have had a experience like that and it’s frustrating and uncomfortable. I’m glad to report the ladies greeted me in with a smile and knew exactly what my gc was. I was in and out in maybe 3 minutes. Very pleased with the taste of the food and the customer service. Even though I don’t live nearby, I can definitely see myself making that drive to eat their food again.</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< user_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>At the corner across from Target I have found a hidden gem.  The facade seems simple but fast food this is not.  Everything was perfect!  It was well worth the wait. From the simple salad consisting of thinly chopped romaine, feta, and tomatoes, finished with green olives that just lifts the entire dish.  I have never enjoyed a simple salad more.

The lamb chops were one of the higher priced entrees at $18.99 but were exquisite.  The lamb melted off the bone leaving me licking them clean to indulge my canine side.  If you enjoy lamb those are a must try.

If you’re are on a budget then definitely go with the beef DUMPLINGS.  They pop in your mouth with fresh, RICH, savory juiciness that leaves you wanting more!!!  Finishing on a high note with sweet traditional baklava I will definitely be back more!!!<//review>< Pics>

Nice staff, great food. We chatted with the owner. He was fabulous. We will definitely go again.
The falafel were very nice and crispy, steamed beef buns were very tasty. Everything was great.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>My daughter and I were craving hummus and pita bread, and our usual spot was closed today. So we decided to come here. I always notice a great smell from this little restaurant in the Target parking lot. Oh my, what a great find! We both ordered the chicken breast plate, which came with salad and rice. I almost ordered a large side of hummus, but the gal let me know that it came for free with pita bread with our meal. Awesome! We ordered a side of fries for the kiddos too.

The chicken was amazing! So tender and flavorful. The crispy edges are the best! The rice looked like regular jasmine rice, but it had such good flavor. The salad was so good that I will order a whole salad next time. I couldn't get enough of it!

Our food was so hot, the way we like it. It would still be good for pick up to take home. Oh and the fries were a fun treat to have on the side. We can't wait to try the rest of your menu!

Almost forgot my leftovers. Thank you for saving them for us! Will see you soon! You guys are great! :)< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1559279959544, 'text': 'Thank you 😊'}< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Food was very tasty.  Service was friendly and promptly done, and they were busy! Will definitely return, but would like to see a bit more organized table layout.

I'm still happy with the food, but lately whenever we order for delivery or take out, we've been getting Ranch instead if tzatziki sauce.   I was very disappointed,  I personally hate ranch and it's not a substitute for yogurt- cucumbers dip sauce.</Review>

<review>Good food. Better prices. The menu had a decent selection of items, but nothing that really made the restaurant stand out from your average Mediterranean or Persian restaurant. The food was very good. The beef kabob was grilled just right. The hummus was very good. The falafel was a little overdone on the outside, but the inside was perfect. The grilled vegetables dish was good but a little salty. But for the amount of food, the fast service, and plenty of seating, the price made up for most of the shortcomings. Definitely a really good restaurant for a quick lunch or dinner.<//review><time>1535680450269<//time></record></dataset><record>

<text>Not only is the food amazing and fresh, but the employees are always polite and attentive. Best part of my multiple amazing experiences here was my interactions with the owner, Naz. The man knows how to run a business and keep his customers happy. Every single time I'm there he's always making sure that I know how long for my food to be done. He most concerned about getting you your food fresh and it NEVER disappoints. Highly reccomend this place for any dish on the menu! I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. Keep it up, Naz! I'll definitely be seeing you again soon!</text>< user>

<text>My wife and I visited for the first of what will be many time a couple of days ago.  We love food from this general region and the food here was exceptional.  My wife had the lamb and I had the beef kabob.  She really enjoyed the lamb and the beef was wonderful.  Perfect flavor without any out of place spices was found in everything.  The falafel was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with a truly impressive flavor.  The hummus was delicious.  Everything was fresh.  The decor included many interesting and thought provoking pieces about the history of Armenia that was very enjoyable.  The owner and the staff were very friendly and personable and the service was top notch.  I loved it!</text></record>

<Review>Great new restaurant.  Owner was with Royal Kabob.  Friendly staff and owner.  Nice casual, comfortable and pleasant dining room.  Very clean.  Order at the counter and food is delivered to your table.  Started with a nice Borscht soup.  We had a Lamp Chop and Pork Rib entree.  Prices are also nice!  Food, delightful! We will be back shortly.  Many friends will be delighted to know they are back in business.  We have had the good fortune to use their catering service.  Wonderful!< /Review>< Response>

Friendly service, lots of delicious dishes to choose from and affordable. Freshly made hummus and pita bread triangles come with your meals. Each table has a vase of colorful carnations atop a pretty lace-like tablecloth next to a sunny window. We look forward to dining there again!< /Text>

<text>My daughter and I walked in just minutes before closing on a Sunday, half expecting to be turned away or asked to order to go. Instead, we were politely accommodated and served some of the most delicious food I've had recently.

I ordered a bowl of borscht and the lamb leg kebab plate; my daughter ordered the chicken thigh kebab plate. Our meal also came with a basket of pita bread and a small cup of hummus. Everything tasted great; my lamb and borscht were unbelievably flavorful and fresh-tasting. The service was friendly without being intrusive. We'll definitely be back!<//text></record>

Placed a to-go order and asked to substitute one item. When I returned to pick up my order, the cashier apologized that they substituted too many of the sides and gave me an additional package with the intended substitution. What great attention to detail and customer care (and free/great tasting food) Will definitely be back.
Btw, they do charge extra for the taziki sauce, but it is worth it.< /review>< pictures>

These guys are awesome!! Quick story...
I used grubhub to order 2 chicken breast plates and the grub hub driver ended up now showing up. Long story short the restaurant owner made another entire order and showed up at my doorstep with hot food in hand. When have you ever seen the owner of a restaurant drive to a customers house to deliver their food??
Oh and their food...TOP NOTCH.
A+ for Armenian grill house
F- for grub hub.</Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Highly upset. We ordered dinner tonight from door dash. Two chicken gyro wraps and a side of falafel. The wraps had dry chicken, no sauce, a few olive slices, four SMALL PIECES of sliced onion and a stale pita wrap. The falafel was dry and cold. $32 worth of food and we couldn't even call to order something else because they closed at 8pm. So we had to put in a whole new door dash order at another place and are out $30<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The tri-tip rice bowl that I got was delicious, and the pita bread that came with it was fresh and perfect. I will definitely be back next time I come out to the North.< /review>

The food was delicious! The owner was really nice and came over to ask how everything tasted and you could tell how passionate he is about his food. The baklava was also to die for. It wasnt too sweet and was light and airy. Simply perfect. And prices are great too! Will defintely be coming here more often!</Text>

Just ate here for the first time. I ordered the lamb wrap gyro, and the sarma dolma. Both were absolutely delicious, and super fresh. I actually liked the fact that I had to wait a bit for my food, because it meant that they were making my food to order! Not only was my dinner super good, but the customer service was top-notch. The gentleman who took my order was very helpful and patient with all of the questions I had about the Armenian cuisine--not to mention how kind he was! I will be a repeat customer!<//Text>

Very nice people run the pkace, but the food was flavorless.  The rice was just plain white rice with none of the seasonings I expected.  Same with the chicken...nicely cooked but only with the very slightest hint of salt, lemon...maybe oregano too.  Very disappointing and not worth the price.  Won't be going back.</Text>

<text>I finally tried this place out after driving past it numerous times en route to Target, Ulta, Michaels, etc. It’s actually a great location because hungry shoppers can duck in for a break and some delicious food. I loved it and will definitely be back! Details below.

Atmosphere: Casual, but welcoming and comfortable. Would like a bit more “Armenian flair” since the restaurant is Armenian. E.g. my favorite Persian restaurant in town plays Persian music and is heavily decorated with Persian swag—eating there is more than a meal, it’s an experience.

Service: friendly, attentive but not overbearing. You order at the counter and the food is brought to you. Our food came out quickly, but we ordered a wrap and a salad—I would expect a longer wait if we ordered kebab.

Food: we had the Armenian salad, falafel wrap, and a piroshki. The Armenian salad was awesome—in my opinion, it totally trumps the Greek salad which I also love (it’s similar to a Greek salad).

The falafel wrap was amazing—it’s something I plan to get again. Everything was fresh and balanced well, from the falafel, to the pita, to the sauce. Perfection.

The piroshki—this was the weak link for me. I felt that it was a little bland. It’s a potato mixture wrapped in a doughy exterior and fried. The potato mixture could have had more herbs and spice, but maybe this is traditionally eaten as a side with something else? Not sure, but it doesn’t stand well on its own. Note that the piroshki is also HUGE. The picture makes it seem small but it’s not.</text><Resp>{'time': 1528269010734, 'text': 'Thank you so much.'}<//Resp>< Rate>

Mom went right in and got what she wanted. She had been there once before.  No heavy pressure. Just nice people.  Erica handled her transaction quickly and gave us space to discuss the purchase beforehand. We bought a dining room table and chairs. Looks one-of-a-kind.< /review>

Amazing customer service! The young man Makahl was very nice and care about his job at the company and he was very attentive to my needs but his manager Emmanuel I'm going to call corporate on him because I am not satisfied and happy how my refrigerator got damaged during the delivery and the and he was also very rude and condescending and saying that I was belittling him when he was belittling with me because I told him about my mother being in the hospital and I am a Cancer stage 3 customer and readmission and I got treated very cold but I will get to the bottom of this with the corporate< /Text>

It's very difficult to find the right dimensions and style. A very nice girl named Alejandra helped me find exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely go back since now I am in need of a bigger dinning table.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1622590233436, 'text': 'Hi Ms. Vanessa, Right on!

We desperately needed a new sectional for our family room. Experience was professional, responsive, and really easy.  Found an item very close to what we wanted, and the representative explained how we could make it work to be exactly what we wanted. Very satisfied - would recommend.< /Review>

I walked in and found a dining set that was perfect for the space I needed it for. Alejandra was very helpful in showing me the other types of sets that closely matched what I wanted and I was able to decide and purchase a set within 10 minutes. Very customer oriented and a very easy transaction.</text>

This store is amazing! I was shopping for a table and stopped in the Pittsburg location where I was greated by Adam who went above and beyond my expectations of customer service and I was able to walk out the door with the table I wanted and it was delivered shortly after! Highly recommend ask for Adam!< /Review>

< Review>
DO NOT SHOP HERE. I repeat. DO NOT SHOP HERE. I bought a couch set that was supposedly in stock back in mid March 2021 and was PROMISED they would be delivered in 6-8 weeks MAX. The delivery date continues to be pushed out further and no one has ever reached out to communicate this with me. Every time I called to check in the date was pushed out weeks or MONTHS. Today when I called they told me my couches were not longer in stock which means they gave the couches I paid THOUSANDS of dollars for away and refuse to work with me or make any compromise. None of the workers know what they are doing or can give you contact information to upper management which seems VERY SUSPICIOUS. This place will LIE to you and take advantage of you. Do not shop here. They will not respect you or your hard earned money.< /Review>

We were looking for a bed frame and stopped by this store. We were greeted and asked if we needed help looking for something by Alejandra. She was very nice to us and very helpful in deciding which bed frame would be a good fit for us. Alejandra gave us a great deal and set up delivery as well, since we don't have a truck or pick-up. Definitely going to return and work with Alejandra when we are ready to purchase more items for our home. Thank you Alejandra!</Text>

Most people would be more than happy to ignore the kids and just hurry up and make a sale. She answered all of our questions,  was extremely patient with us when we told her that before we buy we would need to go back home and measure the space we had in mind forthe nee couch. The only reason im giving 4 and not five stars is because they didnt have too much of a selection.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808559bb6900b335:0x80e62b424e8eacf5</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

In-store: Gabriel was amazing. He spent lots of time answering our questions and making sure we were getting exactly what we were looking for. We bought a sectional and a dining room set.

Delivery: Jesus and Kevin did a great job getting our items into our new condo and setting them up. The day they delivered was extremely hot and they did not complain once, not even about bringing them up the stairs. Delivery and setup was quick, precise and easy thanks to these fellas!

Thank you to the Good deals team for my new furniture!</text>

Awesome experience!!! Alfredo was super informative and extremely helpful. Went in expecting high prices and came out with a great deal on a dining table!! Facebook showed good prices but we were shocked to buy our table for even lower than expected! Will buy from again in the future! Tell all your friends and family!< /Text>

GOOD DEALS IS THE WORST!!! I purchased a bedroom set and couch on April 30th to be delivered in San Francisco. I was given a time frame of May 3rd between 11/1.... I had to contact Good Deals at 215 to see where my items were, they finally came at 245. After putting up my bed frame they realized a part was missing for my bed...I was told that they would return May 6th to finish the job. I’ve called SEVERAL times and spoke to Alejandra and another young lady..she had the nerve to tell me that San Francisco is too far, not my problem. I was told that I was going to receive a text on May 14th to the finish the job today May 15th... NO CALL, NO TEXT! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Very UNPROFESSIONAL..Better business bureau here I come..<//text>

My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience with Alejandra and Alfredo, they were so helpful and helped me pick out my couch without budding in which is what I love when I go shopping. Alejandra had a balance that allowed my boyfriend and I to shop around for couches for our new home and at the same time was right there every single time we needed her, we had her check the price for like almost every couch there lol but she had a big smile the whole time and made us feel so comfortable. Definitely made our first home furniture shopping experience great ❤️<//Text>

I have reported this store to the bbb beware!!!
This store finances you as not running you’re credit but they do. There no credit financing is a SCAM! The sales reps are not helpful I’m actually scared now they that have my information. I even seen a girl save my info as auto save on her computer desktop! Which is illegal im sure there’s no firewall or protection on there desktop. However I was financed and promised delievery next day when the delivery man came he said he was suppose to collect payment? I was financed supposedly for the full amount? Then was told the financing never went through? What?! Yet the financing coming took money from my bank account. Yet when I went on their website and spoke to someone it said I never had an account with them?! SCAM!!! This place needs to be reprimanded!! Guys disclaimer do not go here. I’m discussed</review>
<pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1623017858861, 'text': "Hi Ms. Nguyen. I am not sure where to begin as allot of this information is not even allowed in our systems. We have firewalls that prevent saving any information such as this so we look forward to working with the BBB. As far as financing goes, we have several different options depending on if you have no credit, bad credit or good credit. A few do run your report so that you qualify for the 0% interest. As far as the COD ( check on delivery ) that is only and if only, you do not sign at the very end of your financial agreement. This falls on the sales person and now we have plans in place to prevent any COD's.. unless requested. WE have so very many happy satisfied customers and we love them all. I am sorry that you had a less then desirable experience. Some things in life just happen, but this is something that will now be avoided. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive any misfortunes. I do truly hope you end up getting what you want and have a wonderful day!"}</Resp>< Gmap_id>

We went in there last Saturday to looking for a mattress ,  we were not greeted right away, but ended up getting a bedroom set & during the week I would call to ask her a question and   I would get my computer is down I'll call you back ,never did , call again Friday in the morning I got told I'll call you back @ 2pm , never did I ended up calling her at 2:40pm asking my question & again I was told I'll call you back in 10 minutes but never did ,,,   How are they going to run a business when they don't call there customer back.   So Friday afternoon we changed our mind on the bedroom set but I got told that there's a 25% restock fee but the stuff never left their warehouse in Stockton . So how can they charge  me for that. That's wrong. And every time you go to the store never a manager they always have to call him . Very strange. I did find the same bedroom set cheaper then what I was being charged from good deals appliance furniture (the same exact bedroom set that we were going to get from Good deal furniture )and they came and set  it all up put it together and we also got the chest but it was a little big for our bedroom so they came and picked it up and refunded our money with no restocking fee they took it back with no problem no questions asked. Friends and family have asked where we got our bedroom set from and we told them where we got it from and they went there to get their furniture and bedroom set I would never send anybody to good deal appliance furniture store.And Alejandra is the store manager how come she can't handle things on her own she always has to call the other manager or her boss to answer questions or to have questions answered for the customer when she's supposed to be a manager she should be able to handle that on her own. And today is May 10th and I'm still waiting for my money back I have not gotten that back yet and I canceled my order back in March. And I was getting credit from the credit thing that they use for the nightstand they never put in a cancellation letter and I ended up getting charged so I had to go through this whole thing of calling Acima credit place and they said I have to call the store to have them send over a cancellation letter so they can cancel it when the store manager Alejandra should have took care of all that in the beginning when the day I canceled my order and she didn't I had to call her to ask her to send over a cancellation letter to Acima Credit. So for people just to be aware of they don't do the work they just take your money pretty much but you have to do all the work yourself .<//text>

My overall experience with these beautiful souls was nothing short of amazing. Inside the store, I was just a tag along with my sisters and my mom to look for furniture for them. But Gabriel was super sweet by answering probing questions I had in regards to a new look for my bedroom and he was very intrigued in my interest. He ended up helping me get a new dining set that I absolutely love by the way. From start to finish it was great customer service. I was highly satisfied leaving the store and that rarely happens when I leave furniture stores.

The delivery? Leo and Eli were just as sweet and welcoming when they first came to my door. They were soo professional, warm, and efficient! They put up my dining set super fast (I think they’re secretly superhero’s or something ☺️) and the best part about it they were ON TIME!!!! They gave me a time frame and was here like clockwork, even a tad earlier. That right there sealed the deal. Thank you ALL soo much for the generosity you demonstrated to me in this journey of furniture shopping. I’ll definitely be back and sending more business your way! Best wishes!</Text>

George was very helpful from the minute we walked in the store. He greeted us and explained the break down of the pricing and gave us an example of the added weekend discount then allowed us to browse around for awhile. He even offered us water/refreshments! I told him I had found a couch I liked but I had one more furniture store on my list I wanted to check out. He said if I saw something I liked at another place to give him a call and he would see about price matching. Sure enough I found the couch I liked at the other store and the price was considerably lower. After consulting the store owner, George was able to match the price for the couch and offer the matching ottoman at an even greater discounted price. He even helped me look for end tables that would match the set. Highly recommend Good Deals. Outstanding customer service from George and I did not feel pressured at all to purchase anything. They do have a policy of no refunds but they will replace or exchange something if it is defective or the size is wrong.<//text>

I stopped over the Good deals furniture to take a look at the inventory and I was treated like a king. The customer service is incredible. The folks, Michelle, Alex and Mario are outstanding and would go above and beyond to make sure customers are very well taken care of. The prices are extraordinarily. it is definitely a place to go to if you need furniture.< /review>

Good deals!! That is an understatement,  this place is a place u must see before u buy any furniture from anywhere else.  Imelda is awesome and really listens to you're needs before suggesting anything to u. The manager Danny is definitely running a great team over there.  He is phenomenal and none pushy.  The whole team and environment gives a relaxed and comfortable feel.  Il be definitely coming back to get more furniture.  Thank you!!<//review>

Good Deal? More like GREAT Deal!!! I have been looking for a dresser for my bedroom. I happen to see this furniture store (Good Deals) and decided to pop in to look. Imelda helped me out, very friendly, no pressure to buy, but I'm very happy I did. She offered me a great deal. I purchased a lovely dresser and a matching nightstand!  Thank you Imelda!!!
UPDATE - I came back to purchase the bed frame to match my dresser and nightstand...THANK YOU Danny and Imelda!!< /review>

When it comes to wanting new furniture for your home I highly recommend this place! I liked this place due to the many opinions I was able to choose from... had a good idea what I was looking for but after seeing other options I happily changed my mind... the employees that work there are not only knowledgeable of the products but they are also very honest! Ask for Mario he will help you with a smile on his face no matter what<//Review>

This place definitely earned my business, I got an amazing deal on all of my furniture and appliances, it’s amazing to get such good deals in one place. They have everything, Will the manager was very polite and was very patient with me. I would recommend all my friends and family to come here first before shopping anywhere else.< /review>

My fiancé and I came in to Good Deals to simply to see what furniture this new store offered. Not only did we receive an amazing deal on couches, but we received the best customer service. Sales rep Will took his time to help us find the prefect couch and also allowed us to take his tape measure home to measure our living room with no problems. When it was time to purchase, the manager Daniel gave us a deal we absolutely could not refuse. I would definitely shop here again.<//text>

THIS IS BY FAR the best place to buy furniture mattress or appliances from, they gave me a deal I couldn’t refuse. Got a package deal on appliances and my living room set and was very happy with the way they do business. Do you’re self a favor and come here before looking else where!!</text>

Alejandra went above and beyond her call of duty sharing information about this store with my family. While I did not buy at this time, I will definitely visit this store when the need arises.< /review>

Really appreciate the approach they took with us. No pressure yet informative in the sales approach. Alfredo Q. was extremely helpful in answering all or our questions and advocated for us with his manager Will M. To get us a good deal. Thank you Alfredo!<//Review>

If you want high quality furniture that will last you for an amazing price, do yourself a favor and come here they really do work for the customer. I financed my living and dining room and only put $39 down :) They have very flexible payment options. I will be back 100% for all my appliances too :)</Text>

Our experience with good deals in Pittsburg was memorable from start to finish. We were treated with a warm welcome and were immediately assisted with an informative and professional manner, making our buying experience the more enjoyable. Come see Mario, he'll give the most absolute best deals they have to offer.<//Text>

This place was amazing, great hospitality...from the moment we walked in, we were given freshly popped popcorn and just a great welcome. Being a first home buyer we were able to buy almost everything we need for our home for a great price. Mario and Danny were fantastic. I recommend this place 100% !!!</Text>

Mario was very helpful in finding us a great deal on a washer/ dryer set and living room sectional. What’s great about this place is they have furniture and appliances, it’s a one stop shop and you get great deals on everything. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family< /Review>

<time>1578779721260< /time><Text>If you are looking for great service ask for Danny! We where coming from a different city and were not aware the store was almost closing and Danny waited for us to get to the store, look around, and ask questions. Mind you the store was closing in 10 minutes! While browsing the store, it was past closing time and Danny did not rush out out the store and made it clear it was ok for us to take our time. He even gave my son some popcorn and a juice while we browsed! After choosing a sectional, and Danny giving us options about paying for our furniture, we finally signed some papers and went on our way. We literally left the store a little after an hour of closing time.

Excellent service from Danny! You will not be disappointed!<//Text>< response>

< review>
Highly recommend this place for furniture & Appliances. I went to a variety of furniture places throughout Stockton Ca and let me tell you, the brands and quality of furniture i saw was not the best especially for the price they were selling for. I came into good deals and they thoroughly described the quality of all the furniture and even mattresses. I was very satisfied with my purchases and the customer service they provided. I didn’t feel rushed whatsoever. Thanks again good deals. Thank you emmanuel and Adam</review>

This warehouse has a nice variety and lots of things on display. There is something for everyone’s style or design choice. The staff was beyond friendly, we were greeted by at least four different people and everyone offered to help. We weren’t ready to buy anything today, And there was never any pressure for us to do so, but we will be back to make our purchases here because of the way we were treated.< /Text>

What I like the most about this place is they take care of the customer, when you first walk in they offer you something to drink and offer snacks or popcorn. Sales staff were very kind and patient with me and my wife when we picked out are sectional. The manager Danny gave us a really good price I would highly recommend this store to anyone looking for quality furniture at a great price :)< /text>

Mario and Danny were amazing. I walked in knowing exactly how much I could spend after being pre-approved. The attention I received made me feel like they really cared about making me happy about my purchase. Thank you! I can’t wait for my sectional to
Arrive!</review>

<Text>Originally the transaction for furniture was ok. Not great . After having several issues with defects in furniture, it turned into a disaster.  Both couches were damaged. One finally got replaced but after 8 months now still dealing with getting the other couch replaced.. They are saying I won't get it until March of 2021. There customer service is horrible.  They have switched managers several times which means something is not right. I don't recommend buying from them do to poor customer service. Unfortunately I have to give one star to post even though its not earned.<//Text>< pictures>

This company has the worst customer service I ever experienced.  We purchased a living room set near on 12-1-2019.  We were promised a delivery before Christmas and here we are after Christmas and no furniture.  My husband tried calling the store to find out status and they gave him warehouse number without success. After leaving numerous messages without returned calls  I stopped by on Christmas Eve to speak to them and it was closed. I began to think it was a scam and that we had lost thousands of dollars.  My husband went there today only to be told they are behind schedule and my furniture is scheduled to be at warehouse Jan 3 2020.  Then they will schedule delivery.  We were scheduled delivery on 12-16-19.  What a horrible experience.  I will not be recommending this place at all.  I am used to dealing with places like Lazy Boy or some other reputable company. Unhappy customer.<//text>

After they took a money you can’t take from them what you want this the worst company that i deal with.<//text>

<Text>Worst place ever to get anything, they don’t keep their words, they don’t know how to deal with customers, liars, they will get you to sign the deal and not deliver on time and they don’t give you time frame of what you asked for, they got me wrong items not what i asked for, no respect to the customer. Huge mistake dealing with this place, it’s a trap.< /Text>< Pictures>

I bought an Infiniti at Carmax of Riverside. I was lucky that the clock needed repair because under the warranty I was sent to Infiniti of Riverside for the repairs. Jeremy Scheetz was the service consultant at Infiniti of Riverside. I was scared going to a dealership for service. Little did I know, it was the beginning of years of excellent service. I always got a fair price for my routine maintenance. From day one, Jeremy was efficient, friendly, prompt and thorough. He finds "points" for me in rewards programs that resulted in very low cost repairs. I was surprised. It was like having a family member in the service department. Last summer, my cancer flared up and I had to buy medication that took a lot of my money. I also got huge electric and water bills. It is 120 degrees in the summer where I live. Then, my air conditioner broke in my SUV. The part and repair was Very expensive and not covered by my warranty. Jeremy FOUND a special Infiniti program and my costs were cut in half! When Jeremy is not there, Mike is and he delivers high quality service as well. I have never seen a service team like the one at Infiniti of Riverside or had cars as reliable as my two Infinitis. I used to own BMWs and Mercedes...I will never stray away from Infiniti as long as they keep making great cars and provide high quality consultants like Jeremy.< /Review>

Infiniti of Riverside is truly a one stop shop for your purchase. It took me longer to complete a credit application than finding the perfect vehicle for my family. Things were so impressive that I bought myself a second vehicle on the spot. I was impressed by the values demonstrated, professionalism, and product knowledge by the staff. I was referred by my family who also purchased a vehicle at Infiniti of Riverside. I will return for my third vehicle. Harry Top and Sonny truly made us feel at home and like Family.

Thank you,

Jorge A.<//review>

Purchased the Q50 about a week ago, Gino Guerra helped me right from the start and found ways to get me the best deals and make the best purchase for me. Great experience! first time I go purchase a car at a dealer and feel the difference of customer service, here they help you get the best car and deal, they don't try to sell you what they want to get rid off at top price. Recommend it! Gino Guerra you're the man! Best customer service guaranteed.<//Review>

<Review>What can I say, the customer service here is excellent!! Came here to buy a car for my husband, although we were here very late (till about 11:30 pm) it was well worth it. My husband walked out with his G37, we got a good deal on the car, Jose and Jeff were very attentive. Definitely will do business here again.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dcb0f33cb53d27:0x1607686ca3ae88e0</gmap_id>< time>

Appointment for 1:15, Arrived at 1:17, served at 1:40. Coffee and pastry is nice. Service writer Mike is pleasant and competent. Service starts at 2:10, estimated hour and 20 minutes for service to replace clock and check volume knob function.
Update: Upped to 4 stars service was good and finished within estimate. Free carwash and tire dressing was nice touch.</review>

Got a new Q50 from this location, sales man was excellent but there finance department was horrible they try to cheat as much as possible and think they are big headed about everything. Beware when you go over numbers and rates with there reps because they say one thing and another happens.

We have settled for a 5.59% rate thinking that was the best ( was what they told us ) to find out I was approved with another company at 3.26% ...but for them its no difference since they get there money from anything finance company. I called and told them but they stated once I signed it was a done deal they wouldn't go back. Than a day later I came to find out that the bank there where sending me to Alaska USA ( the one I signed for ) was changed to US Bank without us being aware of this.

The manager there was confused and didn't know why it was charged ... as a customer I would like to go with a company I was told I signing for. According to them they don't need permission to send customer to which ever company after signing. PLEASE BE AWARE and do your research. I will be buying another car next month but not from them with their ( so call wholesale rates ).  DONT BE FOOLED, they make it seem like their no making much and this and that. Do homework and reach out to loan companies yourself if possible, make sure to call the companies they say are approving you and see what your actually rate it. I work in finance and would never do something to one of my customers and then change it all up after they "signed".  Low people< /Review>

Sorry to see that some experienced less than great service.  I have had two Infiniti cars (G35 and G37) and both were serviced at Riverside.  I received nothing but outstanding service each time I take my car in for routine maintenance. The service staffs are just great and very professional, which is one reason I will purchased another Infiniti soon, and have serviced at Riverside.</Text>

Let me say this is an updated review  of which I was unsatisfied.   I had been contacted directly by Mike Connor a Manager at the dealership.  He did everything in his power to make me happy.  In talking to him I felt it was of genuine concern as to the satisfaction of his customers and reputation of dealership.   I'd give him a 5 star review if I could but that would not represent my whole experience.   My advice for customers who might have a service  issue that needs to be addressed is to contact Mike directly<//Text>

I live in Seattle.  I was searching for a vehicle across the whole country.  I spoke to many dealers.  Some wouldn't even return calls, some were very dismissive, some were professional.  Chris Dawoodi from Infiniti of Riverside was easily the most professional and helpful.  He inspected the vehicle thoroughly, sent me more pictures than I could ask for, sent me videos, offered to drive the vehicle one hour away to a place where a friend might inspect it, clearly communicated about the process (buying a vehicle from out of state, arranging shipping, etc.).  He even arranged to have the vehicle wrapped for shipping which is not exactly typical.  All in all, it was about as smooth as it could go, and when the vehicle arrived it was exactly as described.  Zero problems and zero headaches.  Good company, Great guy.  Highly recommend.</text>

Just bought a QX60.  Brought the whole family to make sure they liked it.  Thanks to the very professional service and human touch, it was a great experience.  We agreed over the price immediately, and the low payments reflect the excellent interest rate they gave us due to our good credit.

It is my first luxury car purchase, and I can see the huge difference in treatment.

Thanks for explaining all the gadgets to my wife (she will be driving it).</text>

Almost 3 hours for an oil change with an appointment. Why make an appointment if they don't even take your keys for almost 45 minutes. At least they have wifi, good coffee, and are nice. But probably won't be returning.</Review>

Fantastic people and fantastic prices.  I did all my dealing over the phone.  They did not have the exact car I wanted, but looked around at other dealership and got it for me.  They did all the paper work on line.  They sent a driver to pick me up, drove me to the dealership where all the paper work was ready.  Couple of signatures and I was on my way.  Akram, Sunny and Harry were fantastic... Thanks, I love my new car....<//review>

I just made our household's 2nd Infiniti purchase from this location. Overall, the staff is very friendly and personable. They got me a ridiculous deal that I really couldn't pass up, they also gave me top dollar for my trade in.

Getting your car serviced is an overall good experience with the exception of unexplained long wait times from time to time (the sales person has revealed to me the techs can drag their feet on occasion.)</text>

I had my EX-35 serviced and replaced front brakes on 2/23 and can only say that my experience with everyone at Riverside Infinite is always top notch. The service adviser Jeremy is always very pleasant and helps with all problems that you have. The only minor problem I have ever had was the car wash, which it wasn't dried completely Not a big deal but maybe a little more detail here would be great Thank-you Infinite.

Over the five years that I've been a customer, I have been impressed with the level of service, honesty, and follow-up Infiniti of Riverside has repeatedly demonstrated to me. They surely aren't the closest Infiniti Dealership to my home, but, the drive has been well worth it.</text>

I recently bought my new car in December from a different dealership, but thought I would go to Riverside to have my front  license frame mounted, of which they were very courteous at that time.

Therefore, I returned to purchase the Infiniti Chrome Logo Plate, I was informed I would be called when it arrived.  I was never called so I walked in by chance to see if it had arrived which it had I liked it so much that I ordered a family member one, when it arrived it was the wrong one at this point it took workers on that day some time to figure out which frame it was they kept bringing out the wrong frame.  Parts Specialist Bladimir Gastelum informed me I would have to pay for the frame first, I was quite surprised as I had already ordered two frames and paid on pick up.  He stated this was a new policy..really nice way to treat your customers pay for your service before you receive it. I thought this was an EPIC failure in customer service!</text>

The service person, that was late for our scheduled appointment (the service clerk called multiple  times to alert hm to customers  waiting), said we could flush it and fill it with freon for $150.00 and if that doesn't work we can do other trouble shooting... I told him it's doesn't need freon. I want it placed on the computer to diagnose the actual  problem.

He said that will be $150.00.
Utimately, I do not trust this person and I question  ever going back to that dealership.

After some follow questions, I walked out.. I would not recommend  you ever walk in.

I love my Infiniti and will have to find another  dealership  when it's time to purchase a new one.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I believe my only beef, so to speak, is with Infiniti.  Infiniti of Riverside itself has a courteous staff.  Although they may try your patience at time just address your concerns and they will do their best to take care of you.  Pricing is as expected from a luxury branded auto dealership, but they will adjust it should you feel it is unfair.  So far my first Infiniti is 8 years old and still running strong, minus the electrical hiccups.  By the way these hiccups by no means impede my ability to drive  the vehicle on a daily basis.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Brought my Q50 in this morning for service and as usual when I come here the staff and service is excellent. Mike Longridge is the BEST, always courteous, considerate and does his best to satisfy Infiniti customers. Thank you INFINITI of RIVERSIDE.

First my apologies to Mike Longridge & Riverside INFINITI staff for posting late. Had another good experience with Mike and staff there. Had appt to resolve mech issue, prepared to sit few hrs out but Mike saw to getting me a loan veh without asking.I was able to take care of my errands for that day.
Again Thank you Mike< /review>

No wonder they are going out of business. Asked me to drive down to look at the car sold a day before (no even there) absolutely ridiculous customer service.</review>

OK place... if u ever look for the parts department... it's kinda hidden behind the cashier desk I guess. No posted signage or anything. The people are friendly tho. I'm annoyed on how the car salesman still follow and try to approach u when it's 100% apparent that u aren't there looking at the cars because u went past the cars... went to the building, ignoring the cars and eye contact with any salesman and he's still following u asking if u need anything and whatnot. It's like dayum. If the ppl look lost then it's understandable but nah. And I understand that it's pretty common to greet customers as soon as they enter... but don't need to really cut them off or block them... just say hi or welcome... maybe that's just how I learned to approach things. But whatever. Just totally dislike this place. Also their parking is always jammed with other vehicles almost double parked... so if u are backing up... u could risk backing into one of them bcuz for some reason they don't make use of available parking spaces here.  Glad I don't have to go here often for anything. If u go anywhere else I'm sure u will have a better experience. I know the infiniti dealership that I use to go to regularly in south bay was great.< /text>

Bought a used car here.  They told us the car had never had any damage and said it had a clear Carfax, which maybe it did but after we got the car home and really looked at it in the daylight we could see it clearly had front end damage and had been repaired.  The hood doesn't line up with the fender and the paint is orange peeled.  So if you buy a car here I wouldn't trust the "clear" Carfax.  Its possible they had repaired the car off the books.  We are really disappointed, we trusted them when they told us there was a clear Carfax and it never had any damage.  It was hard to see the car in the evening but we should have been less trusting and really picked the car apart so that was our fault but still they were not honest about the car being in a accident.  We never would have bought the car if we would have known.  Very disappointed.< /review>

Ben was my servicer and he listened to my concerns and he addressed them head on.  I appreciate the professionalism he provided and would definately recommend Infiniti to friends and family..

The quality of the work was ok.  I week later, I notice that my car began to repeat the same problem I took it in for...So I was not please with the re-occurance so soon.</Review>

This was the subway on Firestone and pioneer bl i ordered 4 foot long tuna with good fixins only problem couldn't taste the tuna very tight with the main part of the sandwich and i noticed the owner it seemed like was very watchful of his employee when he was applying the tuna and the guy in front of me was arguing to the owner about paying over 11 dollars for a 6" combo (6" chips and reg drink) my opinion the ones in the Whittier area faster friendlier and more generous services ty< /Text>

<user_name>Roni</user_name><review>I usually come to this location and never had a problem.  Today I came in around 5:10ish. there was a boy and a girl working there. The girl made my sandwich and I would like to give her the award for the worlds most skimpiest sandwhich ever made. My 7 year old child could have made a better sandwhich. She drizzled the lettuce and all the veggies on there. There was barely any tuna on there and I get alot of veggies that makes the sandwhich look fat but today my sandwhich was sad and all I could taste was the bread. Very disappointed. She was probably having a bad day today. God bless her anyway. I forgive her.<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
One of our bulbs burned out on this beautiful lighting fixture that we bought for our bathroom when we first moved into our home many years ago and looked for this certain size bulb everywhere with no luck. We were about to order from EBay (which I'd rather not do) and I remembered Lamps Plus from hearing a positive comment from one of our friends before. I called the Riverside store and had received a very professional and pleasant experience resulting in ordering the exact bulbs we needed. They arrived on the stated time and were packed beautifully with great care (just like I would have packed them). Overall I appreciated not having to deal with any problems for a change, which seems to be the case all to often anymore. I now plan to visit Lamps Plus to look for a couple new lamps once we start working on giving our family room a new look.</review>

I have just bought a beautiful chandelier that my wife picked out and we are very happy with it. Sherise was always very helpful and also everyone else that worked there. Very friendly and professional and know what they are talking about. I highly recommend this store for even home decor as well. Thank you!< /text>

<review>First of all I've purchased from this store before and I'm very happy with my two mirrored bedside tables and beautiful lamps. I only shop with Lamps plus if they are having a serious sale because their prices are very high. The store is beautiful, and I love the way they style the lighting and furniture to give you ideas.  The sales people are very nice and the customer service is OUTSTANDING.  I had issues with my lampshades not matching when they were shipped and they instantly got that fixed and checked up on me after to see how everything was going. Overall I would recommend this store to browse and see all the beautiful things they have and make sure you look out for the sales they're pretty good.< /review>< pictures>

It is a real plus. When you buy a lamp, it is not just the lamp. PLUS extra chain links; PLUS bulbs, PLUS installation, PLUS dressing!!</Review>

<Text>Lamps Plus is great! Filled with tons of lamps plus more! The customer service was somewhat lacking, as we kind of wondered around before we were asked if we were finding everything okay. It’s okay, we searched the store, looked at interesting and unique lamps before finding the lamp shades that we were looking for. Items here are pretty pricey, but the quality of the lamps and more seem to be worth the money. The assistant that helped us was very helpful and was super friendly. Will definitely be back for a few coach lights.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We've purchased so many things from this store over the past several years. I can always find stuff I like and they are very helpful as well. Today one of the employees, who is also a designer, helped us pick out a chandelier for our bedroom. I appreciated having her professional advise. Another time, we purchased quite a few things and they gave us a discount. Definitely my go to store for lighting - and some furniture and accessories.< /Review>< Time>

Store is quite a bit run down. Items needlessly cluttered isles. A section of the store's lights were out. Fridges were off.
The selection was decent though.< /Review>

<text>I was just treated like trash by Hussian or  Hussein. I had $19 in quarters and I am fully aware that we are in a pandemic but truth be told times are tough.

Horrible customer service, and experience with the cashier Mandeep. I’m never coming back. In short, he went off on me after I asked him if he had charged me twice for the same item.<//review>

Great location and amazing service. They have every type of snack and a public bathroom. The Cheshire is very nice and so is the owner. The gas is fantastic and very cheap. Would really recommend for all of these reasons. They have drugs as well as coffee if you need it.< /review>

This is a great station. Reasonably priced snacks and drinks. Friendly staff and convenient to and from the 10 freeway and the convention center/airport. If you need a place to make a pit stop this is a fine choice in my opinion. But as gas stations on the 10 general go, patrons here are a mix of commuters, locals and the lost.</review>

<Text>Always a well organized store. I enjoy shopping it because it's so well cared for. If I go into a store and it's tore up from the floor up. I find myself facing so I don't like to shop a store if I have to work to hard it's not relaxing. They must have good management to look that good.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I came here today to get a few things for my sister , son, and a friend that are spending valentines day.  Today was hard it will be the first year without my 15 yr old daughter that recently passed away in December so I got a balloon for my daughter so we can release it today with messages for her and it needed more air so the lady was nice to have someone put air in it for me. Although it did accidentally pop they did offer me another balloon and were really sympathetic to me. It's hard to hide feelings and not show emotions around others. Thank you for this I chose a cat for her as it was also her favorite animal</review>

They have really nice people helping out near the deli section. I had a good time having nice chat with the employee while she was making my order. They have restrooms in this store and I was extremely impressed with the sanitation.<//review>

<Review>Prices aren't always the best deals in town, and I have gotten sick after eating the fresh prepared food here more than once.  Atmosphere is great and there's a great selection of inventory, so come here when you feel like spending a little more for a bit of specialty in your meals.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Safeway is a very clean, well-stocked, grocery store, with very polite, professional employees. Some of the prices are a bit more expensive than other stores, however the convenience of being able to find items that other grocery stores don't carry, added to the deli delights, sandwich shop, Starbucks kiosk, and always having a great selection of gorgeous flowers, makes paying a little more understandable.</Review>

Very clean store, a regular for me. The Deli is exceptional. Prices are fairly high, however if you sign up for "Just 4 You" (no charge) and take advantage of the membership deals and coupons as well as rewards, you will find some great prices.< /text>

<Review>For the most part they're always able to fill my order as I requested. I'm sure they're busy but it would be kind of nice if they would call about some items but they don't give you a option when checking out to send them a message or whatever anyway but I like Safeway and pick up is usually pretty good and delivery that's why I gave it a 4-star because they've lost my order a couple of times</Review><rate>4< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Always convenient, this one has a gas station and a big store. I'm a regular Safeway shopper, both at home and on the road as in this case. Since it has a fuel station I plugged it into my phone and this was my stop on a 10 hour drive. I live in Lake Tahoe and was on my way to Los Angeles and beyond. Safeway is the only place I shop. We only have 3 markets in South Lake Tahoe, 2 Safeways and a Rayleys market. Its the better deal, I can rack up the rewards and use them for gas or groceries.<//Review>

I was looking for glycerin and had a hard time finding it they asked me for what kind of use I  need it for it has different forms and finally one associate said we don't carry liquid form of glycerin for skin care. I only knew glycerin is a liquid for repairing / softening dry skin.
that's  why I prefer online shopping over  moving between stores in search of a common item.< /Text>

I came here looking for something specific that I thought they'd have and they didn't unfortunately, but they did have everything else i needed and more. Lots of fresh produce to get your meal going.  Wide variety of meats to cook up.  Many breads to choose from and Apparently there cakes are good because there wasn't much to pick from.  Clean store</Text>

Safeway was very safe.  Ha ha.  I hadn't been in for a while,  so the one way signs on the floor and the change in location of a few things threw me.  Still,  I bought a fridge and pantry's worth of food for under $300 and my checker was funny.  So win win!<//review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>Honestly not impressed.  Overheard manager complaining about things not getting done in the store.  The shelf stockers didn't even leave enough room to get my cart through in some places.  Just staff not very concerned with how you will get an item if it means their job is easier.  Definitely was impressed with the produce section though.  The cashier was friendly.  Overall I would prefer a different store if it wasn't near by.<//review><date>1599019223933<//date>< pictures>

<Review>I went to pick up my daughter's graduation cake today and it was absolutely the UGLIEST CAKE I've even seen! I was so disappointed, I even told the girl who handed me the cake and she could care less. I actually ordered the cake a week in advance so was completely surprised at how awful it looked! I had to go to Party City to purchase a cake topper because I was embarrassed to serve it to my daughter and her guests for their graduation!</Review>< Pictures>

I have always received excellent customer service at Safeway. They are always happy to help and I never have to look very far for an employee when I need help! I really appreciate their fresh fruits and veggies and variety of organic products, gluten free products and fresh seafood and meats!< /review>

This store always has friendly staff and is always clean, I never have any complaints. Today on the otherhand, two staff members who are young men asked the person in charge if they could drink water and she refused. Many people heard the interaction and it left a bad inpression. She could have been nicer and let the boys drink water. I like two spend my money at stores that treat staff with respect. This happened around 6:20pm.</Review>

The best customer service I've ever received! We ordered 3 cakes for our company and they didn't turn out the first time but the manager Olivia and the cake decorator Bianca helped us out so much! They made better cakes then I could've imagined! They came out so wonderful!!! Olivia and Bianca were so kind and helpful, this was such an amazing experience!!! I'd wholeheartedly recommend going to the bakery for any of your cake needs, they'll make your cake dreams come true!</text>

🤨The checkout lines are long. Only 2 open + self-checkout, where you can't buy alcohol.🍷  And we all need alcohol, lol, so the 2 check out lines were long and slow. It may be that cashiers don't want to put themselves in danger of COVID and aren't working. (cashier told me they don't have enough staff) ❗If so they should have someone checking ID's at self check out. Then the person with three items incl. alcohol doesn't have to be in the line behind a shopper with a cart Full.< /Text>

They have a really good bakery with fantastic donuts.  Lots of other goodies as well.  I also like their produce section.  They have good sales but otherwise, prices are a little high.  However their gas prices can only be beat by Costco.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  Lines are usually not bad.  Can also get a great cup of coffee and free Wi-Fi.  They offer a seating area in order to enjoy these amenities and seems popular with the college kids. All in all, it's a store I go to about once a month and I recommend it anyone who hasn't tried them out.  Side note, they have a Fed ex pick up once a day and a cash center that offers lots of extras.< /Text>

This store is always cold, however yesterday it was particularly freezing. I was wearing jeans, a sweatshirt and a coat and still froze. It is January, but it was still warmer outside than in the store. And the lines to check out are always long. So bundle up and bring your patience if you choose to shop here.<//Text>

I bought a small container of cantalope (hard as a rock) and a larger container of watermelon no sweetness whatsoever. I have bought fruit like this for several years with some hits and misses, guess it just got to me this time. I will no longer buy these items from this store again</Review>< pics>

I called at 9:45 a.m. and none of the departments will answer.  I called the Modesto store and they quickly answered my call and question.  I tried calling floral, bakery meat and finally pressed 8 for all others and 10 minutes later no answer.  I was hung up on by the system twice WOW POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!<//Review>

Unfriendly employees, customer was offered the monopoly game and tickets. When I got home realized the game actually did start again, and I was not offered a game board or the 15 tickets I was entitled to. I didn't want to play anyway played twice before and game is rigged. I guess The new Safeway rule is not to offer to people paying with food stamps..  😂</text>

Very nice store, above average friendly staff, great deals as a club member. However, it strikes me as a bit unusual that the lighting towards the back of the store is very dark. Overall love this Safeway and will be back soon.< /review>

Sometimes when I walk in I feel judged by people because I feel out of place. I'm Latino and this is Turlock after all, but regardless the staff are friendly most of the time and the selection is amazing. Especially the clearance section. I go straight there Everytime because college is expensive lol. But regardless, I like coming here every now and then.<//text>

I really like this Safeway, but they need to make the self checkout machines quicker. This is the 21st century and were almost 20 years in, we shouldn't have to answer redundant questions and take forever. Overall great store though.</Text>

Always a very clean and nice grocery store. Best part is that it is 24/7, so you can go there any time of night in case you are in an emergency for something.
Staff is always friendly and very helpful, also having a Safeway card will save you tons of money in groceries, and contributes to lower gas prices with their gasoline pumps. It's highly recommended to get one if you're an avid Safeway shopper. Overall, great place.<//text>

Sandwich was as dry as the  personalities...
But the sandwich was premade.. just like the judgements..lol

Employees and other customers... Just look and act so Drab. Half are socially inept & the Rest.. have some kinda ELITIST stuffy "the whole world is peasents... don't breathe on my wine bottles - Kraft singles.. you heathens"  BUT IN THE DEFENSE OF ALL. THATS JUST HOW IT IS. a divided world. Ignorant and indifferent.  I'll be damned if a cashier's is just gonna stare at me. Like I'm a Martian cause I gave him a dollar in quarters.. or paid with cash & card. 😂 Or cause I got on 4 wire wrapped stones / Crystals cracking jokes< /review>

Love using the App, saving gas, and coupons that are just for me in the App as well. The store is really nice and I go in the morning usually and the lines aren't long and the people are nice. The only frustrating thing is if I have to go in the afternoon or evening it is busy and there are only about 2 cashiers so it takes a while to check out. Otherwise it is really nice</review>

They don't know how to listen to a directions was the worst shopping experience I've had the should get some training on maybe clearing their ears I'm sure they sell q-tips and they should clean their ears so they can hear what someone is telling them</Review>

Safeway has the worst positioning of their carts. No carts inside for their customers. Being handicapped,  having to walk back outside to search for a shopping cart and then walk back in to shop is inconvenient.</Text>

Love Safeway. I can always find something new to try there like Tea for example, or a new juice. They always have something you can't find at the other stores. Sure you're going to pay a little more for it but it is worth it.<//Text>

I am spoiled by winco prices and I have hard time paying double prices because Safeway has wooden floors and nicer presentation but I don't have any complaint either. If I must buy, then I go there.< /review>

<Text>You can get great deals on quality food products, provided you have a Club Card. However, whenever I am in this store, I experience horrible customer service. Maybe it is a coincidence that my visits may fall on customer service's "bad day". I've tried to avert this experience by going to self checkout.  That's a joke.  If you (the machine) ask me if I brought my own bag, and I enter yes, why do I gave to wait for customer service to come and scan their little security card key  ( apparently the same card used to access the bank vault..since only one person can carry it) ? This isn't a quick process, because the magic key holder is too busy helping the other guy out who scanned one too many bananas. By the time I'm done, I might as well stayed in the regular line.

Went to the Turlock Ca. Store just to grab a few items... I grabbed some batteries a cell phone charger that was on discount and when I asked an employee where to find plastic silverware I realised she was following me around .. she followed me all the way to the plastic spoons waited for me to select some followed me back toward the front and I stopped to look for a cold drink and the female employee rudely tells me the registers are the other way as if I planned to walk out or something I set the items down because I'm pissed at this point n she rudely tells me to have a nice day as if she's now pleased I'm leaving. ....worst experience ever.</Review>

For paying such a high price, bad customer service. Most of the time there are few people in the line and only one or two cashiers are open. And when it’s quite there are no cashier. If I have to use the self pay machine to scan my items, I better pay half price. I have to scan and bag myself, then why even I am paying more than any other grocery store in Turlock. I have been shopping here for long time, but the service got really bad lately. Done shopping here. I will go somewhere that they respect there customers and not let them wait in the long line for 20 or more minutes, or Use there customers as a catchier.</Text>

<Text>Horrible service. There are always long lines. Never enough check stands open. The checkers are slow. Even the self checkout has half the kiosks out of service most of the time. Forget the stressful shopping experience here and go to a different grocery store.</Text>< Resp>

The man working at the Deli, Ryan, is very slow and has no sense of urgency even when he had a line of 5 people to help. We (2 people) were in line for at least 10 minutes as he made sandwiches as slowly as possible. A lady finally came to help, but she was slow too. Ryan got to us before she did, so then we waited several minutes while he looked for tortillas, only for the tortillas to be frozen & not able to thaw for a long while; we couldn't get what we asked for. Huge waste of time, and the guy was incompetent. Then this safeway was out of packs of scones "for the rest of the week" when I asked, and had no single person sized fresh fruit cups stocked. Further, their Starbucks didn't have a publicly accessible microwave to warm things up in, and they messed up one of our iced coffees but we only noticed when we got on the road. Waste of $$$. What a horrible experience and a waste of time.< /Text>

<time>1528749504085</time><Rate>2< /Rate><Text>Safeway keeps getting worse and worse as far as checkers, prices, and products go. They never have more than 2 checkers on the busiest nights.  This happens every single weekend I'm in here. What gives, Safeway? I know several qualified people who have applied for part time jobs there and never even got a call back. It's apparent you need help. Hire more people! And they keep raising prices to the point that shopping at sprouts or trader joes will become my norm. I get more bang for my buck at those two stores and they actually have the items in stock, which is something Safeway is lacking these days.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>It's ok.but some times there are 6 people in each  line and just 2 cashiers. 15 mins in line to check-out.they need to call up cashiers quicker.have a few more 10 items or less cashier ready at all times.I will still shop at Safeway but it's not the place for a quick in and out.it's o.k. but not the best.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I shop here often,  and the store is clean, but it is not possible to quickly pop into the store to grab a few things. Check out is painful, even at self checkout since the computer frequently needs approvals. They have a  lot of registers, but usually only 1-2 are open most times. Also all the amount displays in the isles are getting out of hand. They are just in the way.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Worth it if you sign up for the 'club' discounts.  There's no fee so I don't understand why people don't. Use the self check out though if you can.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Got my FIT bike taken from inside the store last night around midnight, and out of the 6 or more employees working the cash register or collecting the shopping carts out front NO ONE?? had seen a thing...  I bet tho if I even remotely glanced towards the exits, with my things in a bag, leaving the register, receipt in hand, people down over at kohl's would kno wat i looked like, which way I had went, better yet, they'd probably have someone on the phone who has been following me since I walked out the store.... This town n the folks in it are a JOKE!!</text><userid>105954141498616486996</userid>< name>

They go out of there way to help you to make sure you find what you need they just take you to it instead of pointing where it is the only thing is to have more baggers<//review>
