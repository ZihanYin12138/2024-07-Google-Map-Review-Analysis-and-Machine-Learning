Their thin-crust pizzas are really good, and pretty cheap, as far as pizzas go. The crust is crispy and tastes like salted butter, which is very nice. The cheese is less than ideal when it's cold, but you can just microwave it and it'll be no problem. If you're either impatient or don't have access to a microwave, that can be an issue, though.
The pretzel-crust is also quite nice, if I remember correctly. Everything else is okay, but isn't worth it when you can get either a thin-crust or a pretzel-crust instead, in my opinion.</review>

Just ordered pizza here.  I cant figure out why a pizza with no cheese is more expensive than a regular pizza.  No extra toppings, I called and ordered a pepperoni pizza  and a pepperoni pizza with no cheese.  The "manager couldnt tell me why other than "custom orders start at 6 dollars".

You literally changed me an extra dollar to leave off a topping that you charge $1.75 if the customer asks for extra cheese.

Check your receipt closely, screwed pricing policys.

When I asked for the locations managers number, they told me no, its private, call corporate< /Review>

Always an excuse.
Every other business I patronize is still willing to handle change during these times but Caesar’s Rio Rancho is special.
Please just place a sign on the door stating that your business is card only. And inform the employees to simply and honestly state to the customer that you are a business that doesn’t want money.
And please don’t lie to me by saying “we just ran out of change”.</text><rate>1< /rate><response>None<//response><user>101986168761296556780</user></record></dataset><record>

Clean store. The young woman behind the counter was nice. Not too much interaction with anyone, because I ordered with the app. Ordering with the app is nice and easy. The only problem is you have to wait at least 15 minutes before you can pick up your food. Even if you order one of the hot and ready pizzas.</Review>

When asked if that was our food sitting out there she stated it was still hot. She then boxed it up and threw it on the counter and said check if you want and walked away. When we asked for her name and corporate number she said I don't have to give it to you. Luckily for me since she took the order the receipt has her name on it.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

My order was 35.00 and you don't take 50's.
Is it a theft issue?is it a forgery issue? Is it to make it easier for the highschool kids you higher to break change?? Why I want to know?</Review></record>

Really annoyed because I had been calling for the past 5 min and no one was answering.

Food is pretty good specially when fresh! Definitely worth the value. One of the miday weekday female employees is really good at customer service< /Review>

Not much to say it little ceasars. You know what your going to get from them. They are pretty quick here though so it's a little better than some that I've been to.< /text>

The first time I come here they had no pizzas ready during their hot and ready hours. I talked this up to a peak in demand. So I decide to go again and call in my order. I was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. I get to the place with one minute to go and they haven't even put in my order. They could have explained that Staffing was limited and they would take longer and that would have been fine but when I arrived I was basically giving excuses very rudely.<//Text>

Pro tip: if you want a fresh pizza ask for one right out of the oven , if not then you might get one that has been sitting for a bit.</Review>

This place has everything. There are four pools including an adult only pool with underwater speakers that play music while you swim. There's a nice cafe with a range of food and drink options. And a huge selection of equipment, too. Lots of exercise classes and even child care is available onsite. The lockers and entire facility are very clean and well kept throughout. If you're looking for a new gym, definitely check this place out.<//Text>

<username>Cindy V<//username><Text>When BC Pleasanton was Club Sport, It was a more personal atmosphere, details were never overlooked.  Some changes were made and an email was sent AFTER the program was started.  Torn chairs have not been replaced, Adults have been forced to give up 2 lanes in the adult ONLY pool for swim lessons to very young children (at the busiest time of day).  We are considering changing gyms.  I do like the my own locker.  That is a good program.</Text>< Gmap_id>

The club has great pools , all you can think in terms of cardio and Weights BUT the lockers-bathrooms are old and dirty. I understand they fully remodel the men’s one but just changed few things in the woman one. Specially the showers have tiles with mold and stained. It needs a full remodel. Also the area of cardio has an old carpet and a very depressing light. Again great equipment but overall the place looks and feels a bit depressing .<//Review>

<review>Great place to.workout with lots of great amenities and something for everyone. The downside to club sport is that is it quite expensive. Even for a private club it is hard to justify the prices. And then it costs even more for tennis membership as well.< /review><rating>4< /rating>< Date>

<Review>I am cancelling my membership with ClubDiscrimination. A few of us parents got together and had one of the members bring a serious matter to the General Manager. The matter being that some members were being permitted to run our children off the courts if they wanted to use the entire court for a pick up game. None of these events were scheduled and my children were their first. The parent, who coaches basketball, whom we had speak to the General Manager, stated that she was only concerned about which set of rules might result in more revenue lost and not at all about making sure that the rules protected all members equally. This General Manager is a serious threat to ClubSport. There is no time that exists to protect my children who are there to train. There is only one rule in place, during all open hours, effecting both courts, to grant all power to members who wish to play pick up. And, there is no rule in place to protect time for the players who pay dues to train there. I pay the same amount of massively high dues that those players play and my kids aren't told to sit at the back of the bus, rather they are told to get off the bus. ClubSport obviously doesn't care at all about our youth sports in Pleasanton. This is truly warped thinking. I plan to take this to their corporate offices, the all forms of media. My kids, are planning to get all their friends together and picket ClubSport at the street entrance. The kids from basketball are angry. It's the basketball courts today and that may not bother you if you don't use them. But, think about the principal. What if tomorrow, you are working out on your favorite cycle, having got to it first. Then a few people walk over & kick you off it, because they claim ClubSport started a new rule that protects groups of 3 & more members training together, to be able to occupy the equipment they want. And so you can be kicked off any equipment any time by equally paying members. Is that really any different? Groups of members may have a good argument why they need to be together and use certain equipment in certain orders. But what makes any members' desires or needs greater than another member's? That's the issue. All equipment, gyms, courts, showers, etc. should be available on a 1st come 1st serve basis. But, ClubSport disagrees with that. They believe that members training for basketball are expendable.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

ClubSport makes workouts fun and productive with an endless array of options. I love the salt water pool and wide variety of group fitness classes, especially cycle spin. The staff, customers, and everyone you come into contact here are so nice as well.<//Text>

<Text>There isn't any user review about the infant care and I thought my experience can be useful information for others considering the membership.

First off, the nannies don't have a set time of work as in everytime you go in there's a different person taking care of your baby and that could mean longer adjustment time. Most caretakers are young girls which can mean less to zero experience taking care of babies. One time I caught a girl just letting my baby cry out rather than trying to calm him down. And the moment I walked in the front desk employee at club kids and the nanny both had the 'she caught us' expression on their faces.

When you take a tour of the facility they show a tv monitor in the workout floor where you can see how your baby is doing. This monitor is strategically placed far away from the workout area and they have made sure there is only one monitor for the entire facility with really tiny display from each children's area. Meaning they don't want you to keep an eye all the time on what's going on in the baby room.<//Text>< Pics>

MEMBERS ARE NOT EQUAL HERE!
My kids can never use the basketball courts there. For a month straight, they were kicked off the courts from members wanting to play pick up. I spoke to the GM who has specific rules to protect only the pick-up members and who refuses to make any consideration for the training members. She clearly has a bias with the pick-up men. I agree with prior posts that feel their kids are being discriminated against and that not all members are protected equally. This place is the highest priced club anywhere around and it is a shame to see them not protect the rights to use the courts for all the members, rather than a few. I personally saw 14 MEMBERS standing around the sides of the court, unable to play, because a rule is in place by the GM that allows ONLY pick-up game MEMBERS, to kick training MEMBERS off the court, who were there first, ALL hours of business. They have 2 courts and won't even limit the pick-up rule to 1 court. They simply refuse to protect the training MEMBERS and furthermore permit them to be abused by house rule! I have children that are being trained at a high cost for basketball, joined a gym that said my kid can go use the courts anytime and it was a lie. Actually, I often see members who walk up to the courts, and then just keep walking by, as they already know they can't train in there. I can't imagine any reason why a member based gym would allow some of the members to rule and control the courts. But, this is a pathetic practice that makes no sense, and is by definition discriminatory. As a basketball coach for youth sports, I know a number of irate families that plan to make this very public.</text>

This place discriminates against our youth basketball players. You'll be told at sign up that they can play basketball anytime. Yet, they have an old rule that protects the 10-20 older men who want to play a pick-up. The rule states that at ANY time, if 10 players want to have a pick up game, they get to through the other players off the court, who were there first & pay the same money in dues. Furthermore, they can do this on both courts. In short, CS will NOT do anything to protect the rights of their other customers, who might be to small to play with 20-50 year old men, or who might need to just train. They have made a rule to ALWAYS protect the customers who want pick up games & NO rules to protect t the players who want to train. Management has said, "come when pick-up guys aren't here, like at 9:30pm", when most kids are in bed. They refuse to limit that rule to 1 or the 2 courts or limit the amount of time these guys can monopolize it. The GM had a conversation with one of the angry parents, who was told she wouldn't make any changes to the "24-hour ALL encompassing rule" that gives a group of maybe 20 guys, a monopoly & control of the courts, offering NO protection for the other members who pay huge monthly dues. It is an outrage for a GM of a dues based service business, to set up a rule that only protects a small minority and ignores the remaining members. Facilities like this first set rules that protect the interests, access and rights of ALL members. Then if they can implement a rule to help smaller groups, without impacting the access & rights of the client base, then those are looked at. In this case, the absolute reverse was done, except that NO rule was even put in place to protect the client base.. only the small minority group of men who come in every weekday at peak hours, throw everyone off the court & monopolize it for 4 hours. Being made aware of the conversation that took place with the GM, it is clear that the GM felt this was an issue of which way she'll lose more memberships. Bottom line, the rights that were sold to the members are not most important here, not all members are equal and the rules of this place are made to serve the men, with no concern for women and children. Pleasanton is a huge Youth Basketball city... But, this place won't give your kids a place to train. They'll protect the old men playing pick up & tell you to bring your kids when your normally at work or after 9:30pm on a school night. They wouldn't dare tell the old men to come when the courts are empty, during those times....  That would be offensive.... but being offensive to the kids is fine. Unexpected? Yes! Pleasanton is such a kids & family oriented town. Every business caters to families with children. But, while Pleasanton is a kids town, ClubSport isn't. So, just remember that 24 hour fitness is a fraction of the cost of a place that discriminates against our children and where not all members are equal.</Text>

Gym is fine but the daycare is not great. The first time I went there they called me within 10 minutes of my child being there because he cried a little. Not even a lot, by the time I got interrupted during my work out and went back to the daycare he was not crying any longer but I took him anyway and left. Since then they have apparently taken issue with the glass mason jar I take his formula in, but won’t discuss it directly. Instead they leave notes on it saying “no glass please”. I understand they don’t want broken glass but are they intending to throw around my baby’s formula like a toy? What about moms that choose to only use glass bottles? Will they be shamed into not coming to daycare because of the ways they choose to parent?</review>

Great classes and services are included with the membership, including childcare allowances. Awesome selection of weight and cardio machines, multiple large studios for assorted classes, lots of indoor tennis, and well-heated pools and spa outdoors. Locker rooms are clean and modern. It's the staff that really make the difference, though.< /Text>

<Review>Probably the best branch out of all the other ones, now that Clubsport has officially merged with BayClub, Clubsport Pleasanton is spacious, clean, and versatile. It has two large, 25m, multiple-lanes outdoor pools; it operates many indoor tennis courts, along with all the standard equipments that one would expect from a fitness center.

The staff are friendly and courteous, and they even keep your lost items, labbeled and well-kept, for a whole month for the patrons to claim back.

I particularly like the experience of swimming in near freezing temperature in the early morning, and then head straight to the steam room and sauna after a brief shower.

This branch is organized and has everything.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808fec0945be7d65:0x9e1d4b21dcc41dd7</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

For me the most determining factor was the pool , the pools actually , altogether 16 lanes compare to 3 in my previous club , but even more important the water quality of it as there is not chlorine or at least excessive amounts of it,  here they use another saline chemical that doesnt dry and stick to your skin , it really is a completely different feeling . I still have to try more stuff , i sign up for tennis matches drop-in , apparently very popular here too , there are 8 perfectly mantained tennis courts , so , i wasnt actually planning on integrating tennis in my activities but they are telling me that it is very easy to match people to play with and the courts again are in perfect condition , i do have great expectations ... ill follow up with an update as i go .</Text><UserId.>115957722201951872409</UserId.>< Pics>

<Review>I'm not supporting a place that makes rules to give better access to a few of the guest & not the other guests. That is the definition of discrimination. I read on yelp a letter from CS's manager. He only offered to discuss their programming times. It's clear that he doesn't get how discriminating it is, to make rules that a few people can kick off other people who were there before them, at any time of any day. Yet, the kicked off group, have no time where they can do the same. The rules are 100% set in favor of one group of members. This manger seems to have a conflict of interest somewhere, that someone should expose. He simply side steps the real issues in his reply to a member. But, what is crystal clear, is that he never states that he is sorry for it and will make sure that equal access is guaranteed to both sides. He won't say that, because they maintain that the pick-up members can kick you off at ANY time & off ANY court. He simply asks for a call to try to convince the member that giving access rights to 1 group of members only, is fair & not discriminatory. Also, there are 2 courts. So, the fact that they won't even limit the effect of that rule to 1  court, so that the training members have the other is insane. I have been there so many times to practice my basketball after work. But, I always end up just walking past the courts and on to something else, as the court is being hogged by pick up players. I have also been kicked off the court, along with many other training players, despite having been there 1st, by players getting together a pick up game. I am shocked that such a expensive club would treat its members this way. The norm for clubs is that they refuse to set up rules that will deprive even the very few members of rights, even when it will benefit the vast majority. The understand that NO MEMBER can EVER be DISCRIMINATED against. I suggest they set up a pick-up rule for 1 court & a training rule for the other court.  Sounds fair... right? Not to CS. No, they appear to want 1 sided rules for only select members' use of the gym. As can be seen, they don't really care how many members they offend. I have paid a lot of money to belong to this gym and if I want to train, I have to come during my work hours or when I would normally be going to bed. But the pick-up members have their choice of ANY TIME. So, even if I stated taking off work to come train when no one is there, if suddenly enough guys switched to that time also for a pick-up game, they could again, kick me off the court that I pay to be able to use. I've spoke to members at Club Sport who all also agree that the rule is completely unfair. Especially when those guys hold that court for about 4 hours straight. There must be a reason why certain members get carte blanche at club sport & why the rest of us are told to just be happy with their left overs. No matter what the reason is, this is discrimination! If I had kids trying to train for youth basketball, as other members have complained about, I'd be even that much more angry about it. I invite all who view this to voice your feelings about the overt discrimination going on. Pleasanton is the last city that should ever tolerate this. Well people 24-Hour Fitness is FAR less expensive with NO discrimination. There are also so many other gyms around here. For me, I plan to log complaints with the BBB and others.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Worst gym experience ever.

I am a long time member and one of the gym floor coordinators (older blonde lady) came up to me and asked to see my identification and means of how I checked into the gym today - I showed her the app / bar code and told her my id is in the car with my purse - would be more than happy to answer any security questions to proceed with my workout.

She rudely told me to leave and bring back my id so she can confirm it's actually me. This had never happened in club sport all my years going here. I felt as if she was racial profiling me and was trying to find a reason to remove me from the premises. I had confined my identification and she was still in disbelief.

I felt she was being very unprofessional, slightly racist and a bad representative of club sport.

I have been a member for years at club sport and I would have never imagined this to occur - especially since I come to the gym regularly.

I thought highly of club sport until this occurred.

Will not be returning and definitely will be sharing my story with others (members and my network).<//Text>< Date>

I love this gym. I try to stay at the doubletree when I'm in town on business so that I can get access to this place, but if I can't stay there I am not even allowed to pay a 1 time day pass fee. This is very disapointing. All gyms should give people the opportunity to pay for access.</Review>

<rating>4</rating><Review>My family and I are new members at this facility.  Prior to joining here, I am an active member at 24 Hour Fitness Pleasanton and San Ramon.  Both 24 Hour Fitness facilities offer similar nice amenities most important for me is a lap pool.  It is kept generally clean and the clientele and staff are also generally nice.

With that said, I cannot make a comparison with Club Sport Pleasanton.  Yes, it is a bit pricey, but what CSP offers is beyond gym access.  First of all, if you have kids, then CSP is a better place.  They have activities centered towards children and a pool facility that is kid friendly.   A Family membership provides you a three-hour time for kids to stay at the Kids' area.   There are two separate areas for younger kids and for the bigger kids.

The place is huge but kept very clean!  Even the men's locker room.   The equipment seems to be good and I love the open spaces they have for stretching, etc.  The wall climbing area inside is a cool feature.  The pools, tennis courts, (lots of it), and basketball courts are nice features as well.  Did I mention that the pool is kept at a nice temperature all year round?

On top of the sports equipment, they have bar areas to relax or even do some work.  Yesterday (July 13th) my wife mentioned that while she was there with our kids, she saw a DJ setting up outdoor and she found out that they have dancing later that evening.  So, really, CSP is not just a gym , it is a health and entertainment facility.  It offers a lifestyle not just a place where you go in and out.

I have not been there a lot yet, so I cannot comment about the staff.  So far, I have not experienced any rude ones as some commented here.  All in all, we love this place and will continue to come here.  The price is actually just right for what they offer and for how well they maintain the areas.

Tennis lessons, swimming lessons, and other classes comes with additional fees but really, the price is not much different and perhaps may be better even when you try to sign-up at lessons offered by the Community parks and recreation centers around.

At this point,  I highly recommend to at least give this place a try.  You will not regret it.<//Review><user_id>114042692694482653419<//user_id><Time>1500062698332< /Time></record></dataset><record>

I've never been to Jiffy Lube, but I saw they would do your oil change while you sat in your vehicle. I pulled of Blackstone into their lot, they guided me to a spot where I waited briefly. They took my info, got me in, changed oil and filter, checked fluids, air pressure and tire condition and helped me set my change oil light.  They were busy, but I was in and out in a reasonable amount of time, and I never had to leave my vehicle and they were all wearing masks.</text>

Everyone here is GREAT!  They always alert me to coupons I can use, the service is quick and efficient and I don’t feel pressured to do anything extra.   They give recommendations when needed and also let me know if I can wait to have more service done to my vehicle.  I have always felt I have been treated fairly here. I live in Clovis, but drive all the way to the Blackstone/Herndon location because I have always been treated well here.  I highly recommend them!< /Text>

<Text>Best Jiffy Lube location ever! New building, new tools, new waiting room. I’ve been Jiffy Lube customer all my life. I like this location more than other locations of Jiffy Lube; because of its staff. They are always friendly, kind, and professional. They treat with respect and handle your car needs efficiently. They listen to you, and try their best to help you. Every visit to this location is a new experience. I recommend this location for everybody! If you want a good oil change, rotation, air and cabin filter change, then this is the place you need to visit. Totally worth trying, totally worth your money!<//Text><Response>None</Response><userid>101889092001227300826<//userid></record>

I get my oil changed here when it is time.  The crew seems to be  hard working and honest, in my opinion.  With Covid, I have t driven as much as I usually do.  They told me I didn’t need an oil change until my mileage was met, even though it had been three months.  I’ve had my tires rotated here as well. I always use coupons when going here.<//Review>

I have never been and it was awesome, I will never look for anything else!
I really like how they show you what they have found, and no doubt about it came from my Jeep!
They are so courteous, thoughtful,
It felt like I knew them all for quite some time you can't go wrong when you go there!
I was 100% happy!</Review>

Everyone was very friendly and professional. My oil change was done within 20 minutes as promised. Alex was extremely nice and even provide me spare nuts (?) for my tire that I lost previously when I pumped my tires. Highly recommended! Thanks Alex.<//Review>

Primary Service technician said my battery “is good”........however on further inquiry and  demonstration of exactly how they assess it, it had failed, for they were unable to get a reading (a surprise to us both). He claimed ignorance, that it wasn't listed on the inspection sheet.  A very different result than telling the customer that her battery was “good.”.

I will not return for service there. I cannot trust the quality of  their services. Fluid levels (windshield wiper) were low; they did not refill them, either, as represented.< /Review>

There were several people in front of me so I had to wait but it was not bad at all. They were apologetic because I had to wait in my car until a spot became available in the waiting room. Someone checked in with an update every 5-10 minutes while I was in my car. I was escorted inside while they worked on my car. They estimated 30-45 minutes wait and it was maybe 30 at most. Shop is clean, everyone is friendly, prices are fair, service is very fast.</review>

I remember going to this Jiffy Lube and leaving without servicing about 7-years ago, because of Rude staff. So, when I went in today, I was so pleasantly surprised. The staff member was professional and very friendly, and got me right in. I was in an out within 30 minutes with a smile on my face. Will be going to this store for my future oil change needs.

<Review>Super friendly staff who welcomed me with a smile, seemed genuinely grateful I was there. I had an oil change, tire rotation, and they recommended I flush my brake fluid (which I did). About a week later, my emergency brake light came on and slowly I felt my brake pedal need to be pressed further (something with the pressure in the brake lines wasn’t right) so I contacted this store and they said they’d take care of it if the problem was on their end. I live out of state so took it to a different store and about an hour later they called and said my car was done and paid for by the Blackstone branch. Super appreciative of the honest and good work they do.</Review><date>1585687683382<//date><pics>None< /pics>< name>

<text>I called to see if they could service my RV.   A man who answered the phone said you can swing on by in if you can fit in will take you. I asked well how tall are your bays.  He said  I don't know. I responded I know how tall I am. I should not have to drive over there to find out how tall your bays are. you should know how tall your bays are.

He responded well I'm sorry I guess but then again I'm not sorry.

What kind of customer service is that?</text><Name>Sandie Mosher</Name>< rate>

OUTSTANDING, ABOVE & BEYOND QUALITY, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  Five Stars to this AMAZING Herndon & Blackstone Jiffy Lube!  Manager Anthony, Touger, Miguel, Edgar, and their Team are awesome. They not only found what other mechanics couldn't, but fixed it in no time at all. They even trouble shooted and we're on it. Highly recommend them, they do way more than just oil changes!</Text>

<Text>I went into this place on Saturday morning. I was convinced to get a synthetic blend oil change on my vehicle. I was told there was no difference. I drove it home and it seemed weird to me. I drove it the rest of the weekend and it was clear that my car was struggling a lot more to drive and the engine was much louder. I wasn’t happy and I was scared to even drive my car. I came back here Tuesday afternoon and told them my problem. They took it into the shop, did a complete oil change with FULL synthetic and new oil filter at no charge. My car now runs just as wonderful as it always has. I recommend to NOT use a synthetic blend on a car that has only had full synthetic it’s whole life. Especially if you’re driving a Nissan like I am. I also highly recommend coming here. They took care of the problem free of charge. They told me they would take care of it with no hassles or issues what so ever. The people here are actually GENUINELY nice. Like not that fake I-have-to-be-nice-to-you-because-it’s-my-job nice. But truly genuine. As a famous murdering robot from the future once said; “I’ll be back!”</Text>< Pictures>

Wonderful team who seemed more concerned about ensuring that I have all the information I need to make a good decision.  When I told them I want to replace the rear break pads in addition to the front pads that they told me required replacement, they made sure I knew the replacement wasn't necessary.  They were ensuring I knew the replacement wasn't necessary, concerned that I may have been spending too much.  It's so nice not to be taken to the cleaners. I appreciate their honesty and professionalism.</Review>

I forgot their hours and accidentally stopped in just a few minutes before close. However, it ended up being the fastest, friendliest oil change I've ever purchased. Prices were reasonable, too. Highly recommended!< /text>

I drove out of my way to come to this particular Jiffy Lube because their facilities are nice and clean, they are friendly fast and reliable. I have gone to other locations in Fresno and Clovis, and they are dirty, run down, and out dated. This is my go to for sure!!< /review>

Best Jiffy Lube in town hands down..I’ve been to all the others and these guys at this location are the most professional and FASTEST. You will not regret going trust me.
* Corporate needs to bring back the fridge for water tho ,taking that away from this place makes no since at all every customer enjoys cold water as well as the Hard Workers, this water dispenser doesn’t work as good.

They barely opened a couple of months ago.  Tried to Yelp but I don't see them on there yet.

These people are legit.  They will treat you like royalty and go over everything with you.  The prices are competitive.  This place used to be Meineke which absolutely sucked, but these people are making a name out there.<//review>

Everyone was super friendly and fast delivery. Great place to deliver!
Docks are a little closer together so trailer doors can be a pain if you have wings.< /Review>

All I gotta say for all those drivers who come here to deliver from other states and you guys don't live in California if you gonna cry about places in cali and criticize the state then don't take loads out to cali nobody really want you here.... independent truckers can handle the loads coming back to cali. When I go to other states to deliver I dont be putting states down or people its all about having respect but some people just don't have any.< /Text>

Other than that, watch out for the Swift daycabs. They will cut you off to get in the gate first.<//Text>< response>

<Review>From a truck driver's point of view this place is terrible.  We had a 5am appointment and told not to show up early or we'd be turned away and the same applied if we were more than 20 minutes late.  We got there at 4:55am to find seven trucks parked out on the road waiting to get in.  They don't come in until 5 and while they have a gate,  they do not have anyone manning it.  You are supposed to wait until you are the first truck in line and then call a phone number to check in.  The first truck was operated by a driver who either doesn't know how to read, or doesn't read English (very likely these days). So we all sat there until somebody walked over and helped him out.  By the time he and the other trucks in front of us (half of which were sent away because they were early) made it through the gate,  we were 40 minutes late for our appointment.  To top it off,  a bob tail Swift driver cut in front of me when it was my turn to a approach.  Then after he got through,  the gate stayed open.  After ten seconds or so we decided maybe we were supposed to pull on in because I did make contact with the receiver who told me he would get to me after Swift pulled in and hung up.  When I called the receiver back,  I got a female who accused me of sneaking through the gate.  There's too many shippers and receivers out there for me to willingly subject myself to this kind of treatment so I won't be back.<//Review>< user_name>

Phill’s is honest, reliable and trustworthy. When I spoke to Jose on the telephone he made me feel confident in the choice I made.

Sure enough, when his colleague Manuel showed up to do the work he was knowledgeable and quickly got the work done in a timely manner at a great price.

I definitely will be a returning client.< /review>

Outstanding service. I took in a completely damaged key and a replacement that I bought online that only needed to get programmed (I thought). Well... the replacement did not work and Jose took the time to explain to me how chipped keys are designed and how they operate internally. Further, he was able to assemble one out of spare parts he had. I definitely recommend this locksmith. Again, the employee who helped me was Jose, a true professional... excellent customer service (visited 07/03/2020).< /Review>

Would recommend them for sure.<//review>< pictures>

Jose, the locksmith, was here promptly and was very knowledgeable and efficient at his job. My car is old school and a bit more complex than the ones today; where they just cut key by a code. Jose did not shy away from the task and got the job done.<//Text>

They gave me the problem breakdown, the price quote for both, and the ETA in one phone call. They came when they said they would and fixed my ignition within 2hrs (longer bc my car wouldn't start). Price was very reasonable.They jump started my car, opened my door, and came to my location free of charge! When here, I ended up needing additional work on door and didn't fix that, but super grateful for what I got done. Would reccomend all the way!!! Thank you Phill's Locksmith!

If you need any help with your car locks or car keys, this is the place to go. The battery holder in my key broke  and I couldn’t get into my car. I called and spoke with Jose. I informed him of my situation and he notified me on my options. He was very informative and he’s also a very honest man.  He let me know that he could fix the part, but there will still be a chance that it might not work, and I would still wound up paying. I ended buying a brand new key from him. I loved his customer service since the moment I spoke to him on the phone, and once again, how honest he was. I know I’ll definitely be going back to his shop for any further work.
Thank you Jose!!</Text>

<Text>We needed to rekey some locks in our house, So after speaking with a couple different locksmiths we decided to go with Phills Locksmith becouse they sounded very knowledgeable over the phone. We were not disappointed, they did an excellent job at a fair price. Now I have a locksmith that I can trust.  Will definitely recommend to friends and family.

I recommend Phill's locksmith to everyone. JOSE came through and was able to cut the key for my Mazda pick-up. Jose was friendly, clean and took less than 10 minutes to make a fresh key. He gave me his card so I'll be calling Phill's if I need locksmith service.<//text>

<user_id>104486416374540766700< /user_id><Text>So, on Saturday night, somebody tried to steal my car, luckily they didn't take it, but the broke the key inside the ignition switch. So, I call a friend to help me try to take it out, but we couldn't.  So I had to wait until Monday to find someone to do it.  I checked on goggle maps and try to find a locksmith.  I called 5 different locations and I couldn't get the help I needed. So then I find Phill's Locksmith, called them up and they got me quick help at a very good price. 15 minutes later, one of their specialist name Jose comes and takes the ignition switch off in a jiffy and my car was good to go. This is the best service to get, so if you need some help, ask for Jose. Thank you for all your help, I appreciate it< /Text><Date>1557788630216<//Date><GmapID>0x80c2cc67de0866d5:0x1e5371d50907f252</GmapID>< rating>

I locked myself out of my home on a Staurday afternoon. I called multiple locksmiths in the area, and they were either not available or couldn't service homes. Fortunately I found Phill's Locksmith Service. Jose was very polite on the phone, they sent out Manuel.
Manuel showed up promptly, was very professional. Manuel was very polite and assured me he would be able to open the lock. He unlocked it quicker than I could have imagined. The price was reasonable. I would definitely recommend them to friends.<//text>

I called all around and finally found this great place!
As soon as they answered they were very understanding and knew exactly what they were doing.
By the time I got back to my locked out car, Miguel was already finished. Very fast, friendly and reliable! I will definitely be going to them first in the future.< /review></record>

Great customer service! Called about fixing a lock for my driveway gate, Jose came out and made it at the agreed time and within 15 minutes or less the lock was fixed. Gave me a great price too.<//Text>

Called Phills on SUNDAY 6/23/2019 and they sent out Manuel in 30 minutes to change and reKEY lock.  VERY honest and price is fair.  Manuel is excellent and very knowledgable A++.  THIS PLACE IS LEGIT.  Will call here every time from now on.< /review>

Great customer service, reasonable prices and fast service. I lost the keys to my home so I called them up. They sent one of their guys over and I had a replacement key made on the spot! The whole process from when I made the call to finish 30 minutes.<//Review>

After locking my wallet in my 4Runner's glove box, I tried the key to open it back up again. Stuck!!

Googled "locksmiths near me" and a range of them popped up. I chose Phill's based on reviews.

They were professional, quick and courteous. Best yet, they found a solution to my problem. Couldn't be happier. Thanks Phill's, you're the best!!!< /review>

Manuel was awesome! He came to unlock a closet door. The lock is a good lock that is not easily open by picking the lock but he resured me that one way or another he would get it open. Well without having to drill, he was able to open it. They are honest with their prices and they are quick to attend to you.</Text>

I originally had a difficult time with this company when trying to call the number that was listed at the top right corner of my statement. No one would answer the phone. This was an issue for me because I could not log into their online portal which they changed from one system to a new system. Directly emailing their customer success and my community manager ended up being very helpful. I was able to get what I needed from that mode and everyone I spoke to was great. I think they may just need to update the phone number on their statements.</text>

<Text>In our HOA (Colony Park), we utilize Management Trust’s (Maria Grant is our Community Manager) help to keep things organized and well taken care of. Our neighborhood has a relatively large number of houses and condo units and taking care of the needs of our homeowners association is definitely not an easy feat. However, Maria is always quick to respond, friendly, willing to help, and a wealth of knowledge to our community. It has been a great help having her be the community manager.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

I have tried and tried for weeks to get someone to help me from Management Trust.  I have left NUMEROUS messages and NO RESPONSE!  I have sent numerous messages via "contact us" and have had NO RESPONSE!  I received a letter from them saying I was over due on my payments., and they are going to put a Lien on my property......I have NEVER missed a payment or have been late paying!  OBVIOUSLY something is wrong and I need their help to resolve it!  I have tried for the past three weeks to speak to someone to help me!  The WORST business I've ever had to deal with!  Horrible company!  The worst customer service EVER!< /Text>

I was inspired to write this review about our Property Manager Daniel Carvo because of the way he conducts business here at the Ocean Club! Daniel has been a breath of fresh air for us and we feel so fortunate to have him! He is passionate about his work and is an excellent example of how a property manager should manage issues!
Daniel always has a smile and is so pleasant to be around. His communication skills are excellent and he conducts business as a true professional in every way and at all times...
We are so thankful to have you and we hope you’re with us for a long time!
Thank you,
Brian</review>

I want to thank Karen Newsom for her prompt call back to my worries about parking for my guests in the HOA I have family arriving tonight from AZ.  It is a Friday night and I know Karen must have been home, but she returned my call immediately and was very friendly and professional.  We have been through so many managers every few years and I certainly hope that we will keep this management company for a very long time because they really care about customer service.  That is hard to find these days.  Thank  you to Karen.</review>

The amount of recent 5 star reviews left by reviewers with 1 or 2 total reviews is extremely telling and obviously fraudulent. The Management Trust has "lost" our auto-pay setup 3 times now and we have been billed for late fees all 3 times. Their online website is broken and doesn't reflect an option to pay online. Don't get me started about their phone system. They must not have anyone working their phone system because no one ever answers and their voice mail box is full.

I am a member of the Bear Brand At Laguna Niguel Community association and this kind of customer service from a community management service provider is completely unprofessional. I would strongly urge any association to stay far away from this provider or you will end up devoting many unnecessary hours resolving user complaints at your HOA meetings.</Text>

<review>Oops!!! She did it again. Another shout out to Trisha Clingenpeel for her great customer service and professionalism. I'm old school who appreciates people like Trish that gives and empathetic ear to her customers. Thank agains Trish, you rock!!!

No, not again!!! Does great customer service strike 3 times in a row in the same company? It's has to be great leadership at the top and people like Christie Forbes. I serve the same people as Management Trust, America's homeowners. During the course of my business, I encountered a company that doesn't share the same principles practiced by the Management Trust team. Through the efforts of Christiie Forbes, I was able to overcome this obstacle and provide our mutual customer the great service they deserve. You are truly appreciated. Thanks again.<//review>< response>

She was absolutely amazing and personally handled my concern from the first call to the last call and kept me updated all the way through. She was such a delight and I'm so happy this company to know this company has a huge emphasis on customer satisfaction.

The Ocean Club is a gated condo complex that offers hotel style amenities.  The General Manager of the complex, Daniel Carvo, is an attribute to the Management Trust company. Daniel has taken time to build a positive personal relationship with property owners and tries to accomodate their needs. He is responsible, receptive and makes every possible effort to handle issues that arise with the properties.

<Text>Daniel Carvo arrived at our facility “The Ocean Club” last summer. The change was noticed immediately. Projects that had been waiting years to complete all of a sudden were done. He made his presence known by being on the grounds, not hidden away in the office, like the previous manager.  He made himself available to the residents. I could not be happier.

As the former President of the Ocean Club Board of Directors, I am giving FIVE STARS to Daniel Carvo of The Management Trust. Daniel is the current day General Manager of the Ocean Club. He is a top notch community management professional who is very proactive, extremely personable, and a great communicator. He quickly responds to calls, email and text messages, and communications positively with homeowners, board members, vendors, and all others with whom he works. He is well organized, very knowledgeable regarding office software and hardware, a good writer, and quick on his feet. If I could give him ten stars, I would.</Text>

<Review>It my pleasure to give Daniel Carvo a 5 star plus rating, he is an Awesome GM.  He has definitely set a pleasant tone in our special building.

I appreciate his genuine concern, persona, and disposition for all the owners an tenants.  I especially appreciate his excellent work in expediting the issues and concerns, and the great follow up to get the job completed.  As in the case of the latest leak and pipe issues we had in the building.  So excited and comforted  to have Daniel on board.

He is extremely responsive, helpful and goes above and beyond not only to represent the property and tenants in the most professional way possible but also outside vendors such as myself.

When it comes to management companies, all aspects of customer service come into play.  Our company has been working with The Management Trust for several years.  We find their responsiveness and managing skills to be a true asset when partnering with them in "shared living" environments.  This is especially true when working with Daniel C.   We enjoy our working relationship with him and with the Ocean Club!!!</Text>

I have had the most pleasant experience dealing with Daniel Carvo at The Ocean Club in Long Beach. I've had numerous questions about the homeowners' association, and rules and regulations in regard to putting a property for sale in the building. At each instance, I was immediate responded to in a professional, respectful and thorough manner.  I've dealt with a number of management companies and rarely have I had someone so responsive, and with such a positive attitude.  Thank you, Daniel!< /text>

I rarely write reviews but after my encounter with the new manager Daniel Carvo at the Ocean Club, I am compelled to let the management company know what an amazing manager Daniel is.  A little background information here.  I have been an owner at my unit for over 3 years now and being an out of state resident, I probably only stay in my unit approximately 10 weekends a year.  Unfortunately, a lot of those times were spent taking care of different cases of water intrusion from outside sources into my unit which eventually led to molding in several areas of my home.  Not only did the previous management not bare any responsibility such as  remedy the mold problem, they didn't take the right precaution to fix the root of the problem, thus the water intrusion is now coming back.  I was extremely frustrated and wanted to take legal action as I just spent a lot of time and money fixing the problems inside of my unit caused solely by the management negligence of not taking care of the water leaks in a timely manner.  However, after talking to other residents and was advised how responsive Daniel is I decided to invite Daniel to meet with me to go over the same water intrusion issue and other outstanding maintenance issues that have not been corrected by the Hoa for the past 3 years.  I am happy to say that I am glad I met with Daniel.  He was not only sympathetic and honest in assesing all the issues, within two weeks, he was able to complete most of the needed tasks that the previous management wouldn't or coudn't do in the past 3 years.  Daniel is an exemplinary manager who listens, cares for his residents and delivers on his promises to solve problems.  I sincerely hope that after the water intrusion issue is fixed correctly this time, I can finally enjoy my beautiful home and for that, I am thankful to Daniel. Keep up the good work Daniel, you're not only a trust worthy and caring manager, you're trully a kind human being.  Thank you.

I recently worked with Daniel Carvo, the General Manager for 1310 E Ocean Blvd. in Long Beach, CA.  I own a business that delivers Fire Safety Training and Fire Drills to commercial, residential and medical buildings in Southern California.  I have worked with many Property/General Managers and Daniel is definitely TOP TIER!  He displayed an enthusiastic, can-do attitude in every aspect of scheduling, prepping, delivering and follow up for our delivery services.  He is passionate about the safety of the residents and employees at 1310 E Ocean and was very eager to discuss ways that we can increase participation and great results for next year.  This is his first year at this building and I KNOW the residents will benefit a great deal from his great management.  Thank you Daniel!<//review>

I am going through a refinance with VA and they are very strict on termite inspection.  Rob Quinn took my phone calls and answered all of my emails quickly.  He reviewed the termite report and was on it scheduling necessary work that needed to be done the same day he received the report.

When the termite inspector came back for final inspection, there was work that was not completed.  I called Rob and once again he answered right away.  He sent out a repair request as we were on the phone as well as a letter of intent and responsibility in order for me to get clearance.

Rob was very kind and I know I was intense to deal with during this trying time.  He really made this process so much easier by being a good communicator and responding is such a timely manner.

I am so thankful that Rob is the Manager assigned to Bradford II, we really are blessed to have him on staff looking out for us.< /Text>

Pam Hunt protects our property investments like no one else.  She goes above and beyond by applying her wisdom and experience to ensure that our HOA is saving money, investing in the right areas that will last a long time, and is running efficiently.  She always tackles everything with a positive, determined attitude.  She is also great to be around.  I have enjoyed working with her for the past several years very much.< /Review>

My husband and I have lived in the Ocean Club for 20 plus years.  We have seen a number of G.M.'s come and go.  In our opinion, Mr. Daniel Carvo is the perfect fit to manage the Ocean Club.  I met with Daniel for a bit of technical help.  He demonstrated  superior patience!   In addition, I witnessed his follow-through on a couple of issues.  Hope you're here to stay Daniel!<//Review>

Briefly: Lakewood Shores HOA along with The Management Trust have both delivered some of the WORST customer service I've experienced in my adult life.   I have an issue with a possible illegal AC-UNIT installation at my complex and Ms. Anne Davis along with Kimberly Street are both giving me close to zero assistance in getting to the bottom of this, why am I concerned about this installation ?  this AC-UNIT sits approx 25ft away from my bedroom window and the noise level is unacceptable .  This installation does not exist at any other unit in the whole complex which is very suspicious .</Text>

<Text>Wish I could give 10 stars to this company and especially to Karen Newsome. She isn't our manager any more because she is boss now.  I know she is a very busy lady but took the time to help me get my car safe list after trying all day to get the patrol company to call me back.  She took her time after hours to call me back and ensure my car was safe and wouldn't be towed.  That is 5+ star service i my book.</Text>< name>

We found that Amethyst Schy treated us as though we were her only "customers." Over a long while she has repeatedly answered questions and shepherded requests and issues in a personable and professional way. She goes above and beyond time and time again. It is easy to give her 5 stars...we'd give her 6 if we could!</Review>

<review>Daniel Carvo new to the Ocean Club and as a resident, Daniel and I had a rocky start initially but I believe that enhanced  and built the foundation for the professional relationship and respect that we have today. It illustrated Daniel's commitment  not only to me but to the Ocean Club. As a resident realtor he kept an open mind to improving the real estate process for the betterment of the Ocean Club and it's front desk staff.
Always cordial and welcoming to potential new buyer's or leasor's and to the Ocean Club residents,  Daniel strives to accommodate, solve problems and lend a compassionate ear. His response time is spot on and his follow-through is unfaltering. Always a smile for everyone, Daniel is the top in his position ranking and will no doubt continue to strive in his career and achieve his career goals far beyond the Ocean Club whatever they may be.
Feel free to reach out to the email below, happy to share my experiences with Daniel.

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I am often asked to rate the quality of service I have received, and like most, I rarely take the time to actually sit down at my computer and provide a score rating.  But today, I am compelled to do so. A little background --- In our HOA the ocean views are so important to the values of our homes.  Trees (especially pine trees) that were planted years and years ago have now grown into that ocean view.  Our Rules were written to the advantage of the Builder years ago which. we are told,  do not provide protection of ocean views.  This devalues the homes  who purchased at a premium for those ocean views.  For years we have heard "we can't top trees; or there are no protected ocean views in the rules, etc.'" After many calls and emails with our manager Karen, she was finally able to pull together the decision makers and they came up w/ a plan for tree removals of these huge pine trees  - and as Karen said, "it's ultimately saving the  HOA on the yearly costs (no more tree trimming) and at the same time restoring our ocean views!!!!  This is a monumental success for our HOA and for this reason,  I think that Karen and her team deserves a FIVE STAR review.   I would highly recommend this management company without hesitation.  If your having similar issues in your HOA, do not give up.<//review>< Pictures>

At this time I have nothing but good things to say about the HOA company. My correspondence has been all about what I can/cannot do with my home in terms of the CC&Rs. Amethyst has been very responsive in answering all of my questions, and has helped me greatly in my transition to living in an HOA. The reasons for only 4 stars rather than five are: 1) there’s at least one fountain on the property that doesn’t run, 2) the HOA meetings don’t seem to happen for large periods of time (last posting is November 12), and 3) the HOA meetings aren’t held in the area so it makes attending them difficult. I’ve definitely noticed some improvements with some of the dead plants being replaced, so now I just hope they continue making adjustments to improve the property.<//text>

<review>I have worked with Rob Quinn, CCAM, The Management Trust, on three seperate HOA roofing projects that were difficult and required a lot of coordination on the Property Managers part. On each project I found him to be well informed, cooperative and able to provide the Boards with critical construction and financial information. The back up provided by the office personel is just as professional as he is and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Management Trust Firm or Rob Quinn personally.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1552089480788, 'text': 'Ernie, on behalf of all of the employee owners of The Management Trust, we appreciate your kind and thoughtful review for the members of our team.

If you're in the market for a scooter/moped/bike/motorcycle, go do yourself a favor and go visit Mike at Riverside scooter. He's an awesome guy to just talk with and have me an amazing deal on an amigo rover along with helmets a lock and a cargo net. We were going to try and finance through the company they use but that don't deal with amigos. So Mike told us to go to one main financial. Got approved, and I'm enjoying my brand new scooter. He's brutally honest when asked a question and that's exactly what I need when I'm purchasing something like this. He tells you everything you need to know before you buy and is willing to answer any questions you have. He's been dealing with these for quite some time, so if you want experience and knowledge, go here first</Text>

Riverside Scooters was a great experience for me. I called in and explained the problem. I was able to bring it in right away. Within a few days it was fixed and ready to be picked up. He charged me half of what I was expecting. Great owner. Great shop.</review>

Mike and his mechanic are great. They took my scooter in treated it like family and gave it a great once over. I bought the scooter used and when I tried the place that used to sell the scooters, they told me to go pound sand. Thanks to Mike for helping me out. Oh, and he is not a sexist scumbag. He's polite and thoughtful and loves puppies, kittens, and guitars.<//review>

Friendly, helpful, great prices on parts and labor. Will even show you how to do maintenance yourself on Saturday mornings.

They were able to understand the description of my problem over the phone and recommended how to repair myself. They were right. I needed a new drive belt. A new one was less than $15.< /text>

The pizza was great and the service was fast. Also the guy working the counter had great customer service, I think his name was Blaine. Overall one of the better pizza places of chico. I definitely recommend!</Review>

Let me count the ways in which I was disappointed with both the service and quality of Mountain Mike's Pizza. I stood at the counter with another customer for several minutes before someone pops out from the back or even acknowledges us. I was meeting some people so I just order a snack of jalapeno poppers and a soda. None of the sides have a price listed on the overhead sign but I order the poppers anyways. The poppers were inconsistently warm indicating that they were microwaved, to which the rubber like texture of the jalapenos support. While sitting there the staff informs two of people I'm with that both of their pizzas were made wrong... So to reiterate, of the three food items I saw, none of them were made correctly.

How is this place still open?</text>

If they mess up your pizza and the delivery driver doesn't want to drive back even though the manager said they would remake the pizza then you are screwed and left without a dinner plan for the evening. We always tip generously, are kind and courteous people and order a simple pepperoni pizza with light cheese and light sauce and they cant even make that correctly. Just absolutely ridiculous.<//Review>

My daughter wanted to play the race car game. Well it was broken. So we let the lady know and asked for our dollar back. She said "cant u see it broken its, clearly not working and its been broken for awhile.and was sooo rude to us. We had to argue with her just to get my daughter's dollar back. Its not about the money but the fact that she works a job were shes deals with customers and she should know how to treat people. Pluse if its not working put a sign up. The food was good but customer service not good.<//Text>

<Text>We got great service! We'd gotten the time a little wrong for the pizza buffet, and they were so nice about it, and let us start anyway. The pizza was terrific and fresh, there was plenty to go around. The staff was fantastic and friendly. The pizza was tasty and well made. I love the sauce and they have plenty of toppings. Good crispy crust too. My favorite pizza.</Text>< response>

< review>
Both times that I've been here, I waited a really long time for my pizza - about 40 mins for two medium pizzas the first time and about 20 mins for a small the second time. The medium pizzas were decent, but the small pizza was overdone and crunchy. Normally, I go somewhere like Mountain Mike's when I'm willing to pay more to get better quality pizza, but that's not what this location offers. Also, the entire restaurant is extremely sticky.</review>

The food is good, but it is a little pricey. If you buy a soda, there are free refills. If you are doing delivery, it will cost you $5 (if you tip the driver $2). This location is cool because they have a large room in the back for meetings and party, you just have to reserve the room ahead of time. The room is spacious.< /Review>

<review>I ordered online, got a confirmation email, and no pizza came. We called this location multiple times, and were told the one time that we did speak with someone that there was no record of our order in their system. The other three times that we called, the phone rang for a few solid minutes before being disconnected.

I have never had this issue at the other location on mangrove in the years that I've been eating there. I will be avoiding this location, and I suggest anyone who cares about their time does so as well.< /review>< time>

They almost always have specials for good specialty larges; you can just ask them when you come in or call.  The ingredients are not the very best, but I am picky about fresh ingredients and find these to be great.  They've got some good combos (we like the chicken club and the robber's roost).  I think you'll be surprised by how much you like their pizza.  Also their salad bar is really good.<//review>< pictures>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Mt Mike's has a rep for delicious pizza, at least they did. The one in yuba city is the best in the area. When I moved to chico I was s excited Mt Mike's and they deliver even if your out of city limits. I've spent way too much money on this location making excuses for why my pizza was later then scheduled, crust so hard you can't even eat thru it unless you get one soaked in oil from other pizzas cooked before yours usually burned on toppings from other pizzas great you before the hard crust. I've called specifically and spoke to the manager. Each time I place an order I'm specific check I've even had to ask them to clean their oven. So here I am wanting pizza and think in my maybe I'll give them another try! Just kidding never again 80.00 for dinner and you can't even it it.< /Review>< userid>

Excellent service all the time. I don't know what it is, but the way they make their gluten free pizza is so good. For some reason it's much better here than any of the other Mike's I've been to.</Text>

We booked a time slot 3 months in advance for our  rehearsal dinner .

However the lady we booked it with didn't do her job correctly and now we have no where to go being it's graduation weekend we made sure to do it way in,advance when we called to confirm they said they didn't know what we are talking about .
The worker had nothing to say but sorry
However sorry doesn't fix a mistake like this this is supposed to be a one in a life time event .
and because the manager and workers at this location are clearly incompetent of doing there jobs or correcting a mistake they made.
Or even letting us reserve tables in the front ,they made a negative memory. I will,be sure to let everyone I come in contact with that mountain Mikes pizza is not a family restaurant and they definitely don't have have good public relations.
Saying sorry doesn't fix a situation like this<//Text>

<Review>Had a slice of pepperoni pizza here with a soda. Boring. Mostly homeless people around the outside of the building and a dusty dirty weed filled parking lot with people selling junk across the street. The pepperonis were small and curled up,  the sauce was nothing to write home about,  the cheese was okay. The young lady at the counter had the personality of a rock. Try smiling. I would honestly never go back here again. There's no reason to. At all. Really. There is much better pizza available at other venues in Chico that far out do this sad little Mountain Mike's Pizza. How do they stay in business?</Review>< Pics>

<Text>While my hubby and me were stuck in Chico we found Mike's, got an awesome pizza and enjoyed the salad bar. Great food! Great atmosphere! big screen t.v. with the game on. 4 of 5 stars b/c they are spendy for pizza and due to only one restroom for all.</Text><user_name>Hope Cowan<//user_name><user_id>114585272564892458512</user_id></record>

I love their pepperoni and pineapple. But they need to clean their ovens more often because their pizza ends up with tons of little black balls of flour on the bottom. Like more than there should be. But I still love them.<//text>

Great service, delicious pizza and a fun enviroment. I was impressed with the level of customer service we received from the cashier as she helped us decide on which pizza to get. She was friendly and helpful. The pizza was delicious like always and I was grateful for the clean enviroment there since I had my 9 month old son with me.< /Text>

Loved their pizza, and after delivering to my residence for years, now they can't? We do not like the Mangrove store, there is a difference. I have ordered regularly almost weekly, but was told that it just wasn't worth it to them to deliver to my location, I would HAVE to order from Mangrove. I thought the idea in having a business was to never turn away business to a competitor and customer service, #1? I guess, Woodstocks here we come! Mt Mikes has great pizza but ldoesn't seem to realize the importance of retaining loyal, regular customers.< /Review>

Have not gotten my food yet. But as im sitting here at 8pm waiting im looking around notifying myself that all the tables a clearly used and not wiped down. Kinda dirty if you ask me after ordering, by the way she was rude and not polite i think that should change. Place is dirty inside. I hope the food is good writting this as i sit here waiting and observing. I will be contacting management in the morning.</Review>

I was not pleased. Burned crust, hardly any pepperoni and my guest were not impressed. I threw most of it away. I will stick with papa Murphys from now on. It seemed tasteless. Sad cuz they used to be my favorite.</text>

I usually get my mountain Mikes on mangrove (but it was closed due to a fire I found out later). Upon calling mountain Mikes on mangrove. .. it was automatically transferred to the 5th street location.

( Unknown to me the 5th Street location was the one that took our order)

So on arrival to the mangrove store we noticed they were closed. So we called Mountain Mikes back and it was explained to us that we would have to drive across town to pick up our pizza at the 5th street location.  At this point we already live a ways from the Mangrove location so it would be a 30 minute drive to the 5th St location.

Upon arrival I tried expressing my frustrations with the cashier and she instantaneously called for assistance and fled! I was not rude... I just said in a mellow tone voice that I was frustrated with having to drive across town without knowledge of the transfer of location. She said I snapped at her which I did not. So the manager came up she instantly went to the register told me the total ...no question of what was wrong seemed like she was just trying to hurry me out there.

(note: when I called to order the pizza they simply answeref the phone "mountain mikes - please hold". The first time I assume I accidentally got home hung upon. I called back again and got the same response "mountain mikes please hold" notice they never said WHICH location it was ... that is why I assumed I was connected to the Mangrove location where I order probably two to three pizzas a month from)

I told her she needed to talk to her co worker about her customer service and she just said "yeah". She didn't ask me what happened or why I was angry - how was she supposed to find a solution to this horrible customer service???
I told her I didn't think she would actually talk to her. after the whole thing I get home and the pizza was burnt and cold.< /text>

Pizza took over 1 1/2 hours to be delivered. I phoned and spoke with the manager about the situation and she wouldn't offer anything except for a couple dollars off the pizza. When it arrived it hardly has any pizza sauce and is dry because of it. Terrible customer service!</text>

<review>I had to wait a while to get in so was expecting a wonderful restaurant, dining experience. Unfortunately it was not worth the wait. My food was ..blah.  I wouldn't call it yucky I was able to eat it, but not a place I would return to again.<//review>< pics>

Love this place.  When my friends and I get together this is the place to go.  I also have a good friend that works there so if you go in say hello to Irene, she's the best server there is.</text>

<text>Really good food and super service. One of the waitresses had a bit of an attitude but the busboy more than made up for it by bringing our dog water, my drinks and the heater. So many other restaurants will defer to the waiter or waitress, but not this kid. He did it all.

As for the food, it ranged from good to great.
Great: oysters were fresh and plump. Truly amazing for the desert. Rubens special and cheesy garlic bread. Shrimp and fish tacos.
Good: The clam chowder. Enjoyed it, just had better.
Needs work: fries - ordered well done, but still not crispy at all. Salsa - they didn’t have any. Tapatio, Cholula or Tabasco only. Should have ordered extra Poco de Gallo for the tacos, but didn’t come to mind at the time.

Prices were really good if you order from the lunch menu. Portions might be smaller, but I didn’t notice and had left overs for dinner.

Pro tip: get there when they open. We got there right at Noon and there were open tables. 30 mins later and they were packed with a line waiting.< /text><user>109313146400701703936< /user>< Pictures>

<Review>We started with rock oysters on the half shell. They were a choice for an appetizer. Rubens Special and Cioppino were amazing. We waited an hour for a table due to Covid limited outdoor seating. But, we would do it all over again! The rest of the menu looks promising.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIPYpT9LwV2RPPwBdjREqyoM4ie3C-YoegJxvH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKio1fBZ6Otd9kvaYWl015SgwbHDqeH4niim13=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><GmapID>0x80db1ba444a64683:0x669a7de64d1767a2< /GmapID>< rating>

We loved it! Very popular with limited seating, so expect a long wait.  We tried a couple of times for dinner, we aren't very good at waiting so we went for lunch. (Noon seated immediately)  Service was friendly and each of us enjoyed our meals.
Fried artichoke hearts, Cajun shrimp linguini, fish tacos and I can't remember which one but a seafood pasta.</text>

<Review>Ordered through postmates, soup and Caesar salad.New England clam chowder was out of this world! Didn't get my salad. Steamed artichoke, not bad, just not very meaty. Chilled peal and eat shrimp, way over cooked.
Despite I'll try them again.</Review>< Pictures>

All of their food is fresh and amazing.
I have been here so many times that I have a standard order. As soon as I sit down, I order two oyster shooters with vodka, a Stella, and the Mexican poké. It really completes my afternoon craving.
Bonus: the service is always awesome!<//review>

Seafood Fettuccine was phenomenal, and you can't go wrong with their Clams Casino or Coconut Shrimp. Awesome service. Only cons this time were tiny Baja oysters, but you should ask where they're from that day before you order.<//Text>

It was ok.
I had the crab enchiladas and the crab meat was low quality.
Service was sketchy, we had to constantly waive down our waiter. Cocktails were good, loved the prickly pear Margherita.
Outdoor patio was very pleasant.</review>

So yesterday evening I drive from Moreno Valley to Palm Springs just to eat here & got turned away. It was about 6:30pm when I arrived, got out & went to the stand they have outside. Right before I walk up I see a gentleman come out with to bags of takeout... I approached the desk and the waitress ask me how could she help. I said I would like to place an order to go, she says OK not a problem & gives me a menu and let me know that a server will be with me. 5 minutes later she comes back & tells me & a friend I was with that they were not taking anymore takeout orders, would we like to wait for a seat for 25-30 minutes......NO I don’t! Why would a restaurant not have takeout at a time like this?? & what is the difference from sitting or getting takeout, you’re still going to have to make a plate?? Would have definitely given a 5 star but I felt some type of way being that one can’t even sit inside the place because of COVID-19 but one or I couldn’t get takeout, plus I drove 30 mins. Guess I’ll find me another Ruben & Ozzy’s to eat at because they don’t do takeout after 6:30.<//Text>

The food in this restaurant was awesome! My favorite dishes here are Lasagna, Chicken Piccata, and pizza. As for me, all of the dishes are very delicious. They are quite spicy, but I adore spicy food and can eat it a lot. Apart from this, I always order some dessert. This restaurant has a great variety of desserts. I really like everything here!< /Text>

A place to go for a great meal and a glass of wine. And the service is always top notch. Two thumbs up for those oysters!</text>

<text>Went here on a tip from some Winter vacationers. Went later on a Thursday, street fair. Were were lucky to be  seated outdoors as it was busy. The clam chowder and the grilled shrimp taco were great! Loved the shrimp penne as well. Everything was super tasty, and the portions were good. Also loved a local light beer recommended by the waitress.< /text>< Date>

Overall just ok not bad and not memorable . If the price point would of been in par with food and service would be four stars but lack luster food and service with high price is why they lost a star.< /Review>

<pics>None<//pics><Rating>2<//Rating><review>This was a big fail. I read other people’s reviews and thought it sounded good for fish tacos. No flavor and the tortillas were very dry. You could get a Caesar salad for an extra $2.50. Ridiculous!! I’m pretty sure that the romaine was from a bag and it was totally overdressed with what tasted like a bottled dressing. Staff was nice but that doesn’t make up for bad food. Would definitely not recommend. Maybe the oysters are good 🙄</review>< name>

They are open during Covid time.  Lots of options for seafoods, mostly traditional dishes like Ciopino, clam chowder, seafood pasta, etc.  Good service and convenient location.</review>

We really enjoyed our dinner! Lunch was fine, but what we chose for dinner was way better! I did the seafood shish kabob. Amazing!! I chose the pasta as my side and the flavor of the very mild alfredo sauce enhanced the whole dish. My husband had the skirt steak? I think that was the meat selection.  It was very tender. I believe he enjoyed it, but, he  thought my meal looked amazing.  We are not big red meat eaters..I wanted to come back. So, on our way home to Scottsdale from Temecula we stopped for lunch. A much smaller selection. The  Shish kabob was not on the menu.  I considered the green chili  spinach enchiladas and decided on a grill instead. It was fine but not as impressive as dinner.  My husband said if we would have  stopped for lunch before we ever had dinner we would have never come back for dinner we would have tried something new and different. There is no indoor eating.  Even though it was  about 105° with the misters on the outdoor seating was fine.  I will return for dinner on another trip.</Review>

We ate on the open patio. Perfect temperature for evening dining. Nice lighting with candle lanterns. Quick, friendly service. We had shrimp scampi and seafood fettuccine; both excellent and with plenty of seafood! Reasonably priced. Good selection of adult beverages. We didn't go inside the bar area, but through the windows it looked like a fun place with lots of sports fans watching MLB playoffs.</text>

< Review>
Hands down one of my favorite places to go for a great meal and a glass of wine. We always start with the New Orleans oysters, which are better than any that I had in New Orleans, and the sauteed mushrooms. Then, we will either get the grilled shrimp tacos or some oysters on the half shell. I can't believe how fresh the seafood is this far inland. The oysters are better than some we've had at beachside restaurants in Laguna. And the service is always top notch.<//Review>

There is no better place for seafood in the desert! Get yourself a seat at the bar and watch Ozzie cook and see if you can keep up.

The food tastes fantastic and is always hot.....every time! Every dish on the menu is fantastic. Never been there?? I suggest Ruben's special to start. You get a heaping portion of pasta and all sorts of seafood on top.

The place is small and inviting. You may even enjoy sitting on the front patio and people watching as the sun sets.

All around excellent restaurant!!<//review>< username>

This place is incredible, the food is out of this world, not to mention the friendly hardworking wait staff, the relaxed cool environment; the owner greeted us himself and was cool as hell and very attentive to his restaurant. The food was loaded with delicious seafood at a super reasonable price. Best place for seafood in palm springs.</Text>

Great food as always and AC is top notch. I always order the shrimp or fish tacos but the steak sandwich was AMAZING cooked to my liking and crispy well seasoned fries. Go there once a week and consistently delicious and welcoming. Great lunch specials</Review>

It gets packed, pretty much every day. They don't take reservations so we had to wait about 35+ min. Food did take longer than expected and came out warm-ish...? (Not oysters). Waitress seemed stressed out by her tables and rushed us a bit. Design, it could use a remodel.< /review>

I had heard good things about this place so I had to try it myself. I had a surf and turf grill type plate. It was decent but the OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER were to DIE FOR! I also enjoyed a nice, cold  IPA while there...after a little while i think my waiter forgot about us as i had to go look for him to get the check..but the oysters and beer are WORTH IT!<//text>

<Review>So good! John from Buffalo and I will definitely be back many times. The Italian seafood stew is our favorite so far. Grilled fish tacos—delicious. And some of the best coconut shrimp. And really delicious cocktails. The mojito wasn’t too sweet which made me happy.  Can’t wait until our next trip to Palm Springs so we can go to Ruben and Ozzy’s again! Thank you, Ozzy, for your hospitality!< /Review>< Name>

We've had dinner and lunch there many times. It's the only restaurant in Coachella valley that serves clams on the half shell! The ceviche is amazing and the wine, beer and cocktails are nicely priced. The entrees are very good such as the pasta with seafood. R & O's has a pleasure cozy indoor ambience and an interesting outdoor view.< /Review>

Some of the worst service we’ve ever had. It took forever to get the server’s attention. The server barely came by to check on us. We sat around for almost 20 mins before we could get their attention for the check. Then we asked for our check and asked to split it, it took 10 mins for the guy to come back and it wasn’t the same guy that came back. A different guy came back and confirmed that we wanted to split it. We said yes and before I could say another word he was gone. We didn’t want to wait any longer so we walked up and had him run the card right then. The food wasn’t great. Oysters Rockefeller was just okay. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich that was beyond dry and dull. My husbands seafood Alfredo was soupy. I ordered the Ruben’s special and the sauce was watery and bitter. I’m use to a white wine sauce being buttery with herbs and being delicious. This was just far from it. The scallops tasted weird and the texture was off. I think they could of used a sear before being added to the pasta.  My husband and I spent $90.00 on lunch and it wasn’t worth it. We always tip and tip well, but with horrible service, we didn’t leave a dime. Sorry for the bad review. I rarely ever leave a bad review. But we chose this restaurant out of all of the other seafood places downtown based on the reviews, and it was very disappointing. Just being honest.</Review>

Found this place while looking for seafood in Palm Springs and was pleasantly suprised. We sat at the bar and ordered the New Orleans style broiled oyester (you have to have this), steamed greenlip mussels in garlic white wine sauce, and couple orders of new England clam chowder. The mussels were so tender and plump and not to mention cooked to perfection. The baked oysters were fantastic! Come here to get your seafood craving fixes in Palm Springs</review>

Waitress was rude and unfriendly. We asked if we could order and she said she'd be back. She went straight to the table next to us and asked if they were ready to order. We had arrived before them. This waitress is an older Caucasian woman. Management and host that seated us were very friendly. Shrimp tacos are great!<//Text>

Lunched yesterday.  Food is high quality, served hot and as ordered.  If you're on your lunch break, might not work.  From seating to when food arrived--30 minutes.  Could be faster,  didn't require any special prep. (fish and chips and fish tacos with fries).  We didn't mind the wait as it was a leisurely day off for us.< /Text>

<review>I'm from Michigan, was in Cali for 2 weeks, one of the best seafood ever.. Wasn't completely sure about it till I ate their food, definitely worth going to.. The servers were lightning fast and nice, also able to see the cooks cook.. I would definitely return to this restaurant..<//review>< time>

<text>First time eating at Ruben and Ozzy's.  Good atmosphere.  We sat outside.  Enjoyed their fish (cod) tacos and grilled shrimp tacos.  My husband enjoyed the Ruben's special (seafood and pasta).  They have beer, mixed drinks and wine.  We had a delay in getting one glass of wine brought to the table timely, and then they brought the wrong wine, but were apologetic about the mix up.  The staff was courteous and attentive.  I'd go back again.</text>< Response>

<review>Okay. So. Great place! Service is good, food is great and atmosphere is quaint and a personable spot. The poké was fantastic (ask for extra chips). For my main course I had the Ozzy Special. Looorrrdddd it is amazing! I wanted to get extra of the dish and just eat it under the sun by the pool. Although, it has pasta so it can make you feel bloated so just be aware. Totally worth it though! Kristi is such a sweetheart and a great waitress!</review>< resp>

<Text>We went around 5pm on a holiday week and got seated right away,  although as the night went on the place quickly filled up.   Food was generally good on everything our group ordered.   Best dishes were the seafood which were all very fresh.   Oysters Rockefeller and New Orleans were very good.   I had the Cioppino and my son had the Ruben special, which were both tasty.   However the one huge minus was the slow food service.   Don't know if our orders were not prioritized properly or the kitchen was short staffed.   Apps came out quickly but the mains took well over an hour...  Which was easily a 2 or maybe 3 star overall rating experience.   However once we really started complaining hard the whole staff sincerely apologized and went out of their way to fix these issues.   They even comped us free bread and a couple deserts at the end.   This is why I raised my review to 4 stars.<//Text>< pics>

Has to be expected in a Mexican eatery.  Eat after 9pm for special menu deals.   Anytime is a good time to eat, drink and enjoy Ruben and Ozzy's.<//Review>< Pictures>

Ruben and Ozzy's is a great alternative to traditional Mexican restaurant in that it is mostly seafood oriented. The good thing is it's REALLY good. Appetizers and main course items are all delightful.
Grilled fish tacos or Shrimp fettuccine either is an excellent choice. Close to the Casino it makes for an excellent alternative to the usual places for Mexican food.< /Review>

We went with my father and his partner on Sunday night. Great food and service. I got the mexican pico for an appetizer and I'm glad everyone was hungry since it could be a meal in itself. Wonderfully prepared. Our group all enjoyed our meals but I particularly enjoyed the cioppino and campechana.<//text>

After reading all the positive reviews, I gave this place a try and was looking forward to having some baked oysters and lobster. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. :( Baked oysters and the spinach were slushy inside and not crispy, and they were tasteless. Garlic bread was a basic cheap baguette and it did not smell garlic. Lobster tails were way overcooked and the oil on the side was bad tasting. Chicken sandwich was bad too, with cheap fries on the side, cooked in terribly tasting oil. When we mentioned how bad the food was the waitress apologized and took the lobster and chicken sandwich off the check. I hope the restaurant will review how they cook lobster and avoid overcooking it and use more high quality ingredients in the future. At the moment, I would not recommend this place and rather recommend to avoid it.<//review>

<text>This is truly the best place to get fresh seafood. Nothing is ever Frozen and it is always fresh and delicious. Ruben and Ozzy are the cooks and they are the best. You can sit at the bar and watch them cook your food right in front of you. Not only is it good food everyone is friendly and is an all-around great place to eat lunch or dinner.< /text><Time>1498251895176< /Time>< Response>

All the food here is delicious, and the staff and owners are so friendly! We went last night only 20min before closing, and they still warmly served us! Ask for the debris sauce and put out on every bite! I'll continue to go here every time I'm in town!</text>

<Review>They were accurate with the time the table would be ready, service was good. We tried poke was so good, I would have it over and over. So amazing, huge portion and would return just for that dish. We had the cioppino and it had a LOT  of seafood, and a great portion for 2 people. My husband loved it but I found it lacked a little flavour.<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<review>Words cannot express how amazing my experience was at Ruben and Ozzy's. The food is superb. The service is some of the best I have ever received. Ruben and Ozzy's are there for you, and will take care of you like you are family. Thank you for such an amazing night!< /review><user_id>112746625883182092243</user_id><username>Arturo Lopez</username><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

Omg! Food was delicious! I had surf and turf and both the steak and the shrimp pretty much melted in my mouth! Service was a little slow though. But the food and drinks make up for it!< /Text>

Great seafood, so fresh.  The oysters on the half shell taste like they just came out of the water.  And if you want something specially made just ask.  Service is fantastic and they have a full bar.</review>

They came highly recommended, and the food was good, but not great. I had the mahi taco, which was okay. The service was okay as well, but we had three different waiters at the table, and I prefer the continuity of one. The meal was well cooked, came out hot, but there was something missing. It just wasn't exciting, which was a disappointment.  We were tired, and it was our last meal in town after an amazing week. Sorry to leave on that note.<//review>

First-time visit to this restaurant and was very disappointed. After waiting over an hour and a half to receive our meals two of the four of us couldn't even eat ours it was so bad. They did take the meals off of bar bill but the whole experience was enough that I won't be going back.< /Text>

<Review>This place was pretty good! I had an oyster craving and this place definitely did it! Also, I order some clam chowder and my husband ordered some fettuccine, but they brought out my chowder first before my husband's food (which came out 10 minutes later). And it also took our server forever to get our check and cash us out (we went in when they opened and they were not that busy). But aside from that our food was pretty good.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Great restaurant. We sat at the bar and Ozzy was cooking directly in front of us. We ordered sauteed mushrooms for appetizers. I asked if he could add some shrimp and he said no problem. We got the seafood tacos and ceasar salad which were great. I asked about raw fish and made a Poke mix with tortilla chips and it was so good. Definitely will back here the next time we are in town.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>If this place was anywhere else, they would be 4 stars. But with all the top notch competition in Palm Springs, it is hard to recommend. The food is good, but they don't deal with a lunch rush very well. They are very nice, will bring you good food with a smile, but don't expect to be in and out.< /review>< date>

The service was great the guys who were worked hard and made some pretty delicious food.. the oysters on the half shell were not as good but I can admit I have ridiculously high standards.. please stop by the have some really good food options. Everyone says the Mexican poke and they are right and the fish and fried oysters tacos are worth it !</text>

<username>Kim Campbell</username><text>Underwhelmed! Our server Luis did not crack a smile and was unfriendly. Set the tone for us but thankfully he had two other female servers that were both very friendly. One was named Andrea. She was a doll. The shrimp taco was delicious. The fish tacos were good. The crab enchiladas were too salty and tasted like canned green sauce. Unfortunately we won't be back.<//text><resp>None< /resp><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

Friendly service with relaxed outdoor dining. Ruben's Special was delicious. Crab enchiladas were excellent with a tomatillo green sauce. Good place for kids. Kids' menu had a healthy grilled salmon option. Would go back again.</text>

The best place for fish tacos and oyster shooters in Palm Springs, easily. Great food at great prices.  The open kitchen is fun to watch, the place is clean and busy, and it's always worth trying the specials.  Great for lunch, too!</text>

<review>Really disappointed. Not sure what the fuss is about. The service was TERRIBLE! The drinks were weak, and the food wasn't great. I was recommend the poke by the waiter. The fish was ok but covered in sauce and served with deep fried corn chips. The shrimp cocktail was not great for its price. The shrimps had no flavour. Won't be back.</review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Name>

Great place, especially for sea food. Even if you're a great cook like my wife, you real notice a unique flavor and taste. P.S. strong lime margarita.</Review>

As straightforward as it gets - good 11$ lunch seafood fettuccine and a better-than-average coconut shrimp. For a good price, it's a good taste. And compared to the other restaurants here its 4/5 for me.< /Text>

Good service, good atmosphere.  I was hoping the menu would've had more options.  We settled on pasta dishes.  Besides the fishy, mushy scallops, food was decent.<//review>

Always have had the best time..best dishes...and meet interesting people at the bar. There is so much tp pick from on the menu...and great spirits especially the mango margarita. We frequent this place quite often.<//Review>

Can’t believe people (tourists?) wait in line for such poorly prepared and tasteless food. While staff were great, the food really sucks. There is a great seafood restaurant on Indian Canyon, go there.<//Review>

Service was good by the guys. They refilled our drinks and was very nice. Food very mediocre. I ordered fish and chips. Very greasy. My friend had Cesar salad. Since when does Cesar salad come with tomatoes? No real seating except outside. Parking is on the street. A bit pricey. Overall, improve the food quality and prices and maybe, juuuuuust maybe I will go back.<//text>

Food was great, and environment was very lively during Monday food "happy hour."
Our server missed one of our party's food order, then when food was delivered she claimed he didn't tell her although we all heard it (and only 4 people, so she shouldn't have missed it).< /Text>

Very solid sea food (mostly) restaurant. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Most entrees in the $20 to $25 range. We had the Green Lip mussels in a very nice garlic wine sauce, mussels seemed very fresh and where large. The crab enchiladas (2) were very good, served with rice and Pico de Gallo. The other dish was was a combination of shrimp, scallops and fish pieces in a red sauce over ziti. Very tasty. Service was decent. Full liquor license.< /Review>

<review>Just got appetizers and a drink here, but I can't believe how delicious it was! Great oysters, and poke...so great.

My only complaint is no beer on tap, and bottle selection is a little "bleh." However, I am a snob about beer.< /review>< pics>

Horrible service. Long wait. I was told I would be seated in 35 minutes which turned into 2 hours. Not enough seating space. Long wait for food that is average compared to many other restaurants. Overall my experience was unpleasant.< /Text>

<Text>When we arrived to put in our name we were told the wait would be 25 mins. After waiting for 35 mins we checked how long our wait would be and we're told another 35 mins. They were taking other parties that arrived after us and a party that was not present but called you say they were on their way but running late was going to be seated before us. We left and went to another restaurant. Ruben and Ozzies lost my business forever and that of my friends as well.<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>Long wait, incompetent service, salty dishes. They need more workers, better trained personnel to give better service and organizations.   Food overall is average and inconsistent.

My 5 friends & I heard this place was good from a local waitress.  So we went.  Initially we  were told the wait to be 20 - 30 mins.   It was an hour after we were able to get a table.  This was because they had 4 tables to accommodate 5 - 6 people.  We said it was ok for us to sit at separate smaller tables or saw available two smaller tables and put it together and they said no. They obviously were not accommodating.

It took a while to get the waitress to say hi and 15 mins to get water to the table.

Appetizers came out in good time for artichoke stuffed with crab, Mexican Poke and seafood sampler.  The clam topped with bacon didn't taste fresh.

However main dishes didn't come out until 30 mins after appetizers and only 4/6 dishes.  The other 2 dishes came out 10 mins after!!  Then those two dishes ended up being extremely salty and one of the dishes was reheated.  (Shrimp was over cooked  noodles were very soft (not al dente)).  They offered to replace one of the dishes Rubens special and it came within 5 mins and it was glossy however same saltiness.  So having loss in faith of competence and I didn't want to wait longer; I didn't order more food

The waitress said our order were forgotten.  People who sat down after us gotten their appetizers and main dishes.

The waitress never offered any accommodations while waiting or having salty food.

We all had beer and drinks.  But there was no offer of them or waitress asking if we wanted another one.

In the end the manager gave a discount, however I have lost faith in their ability to produce edible food<//Text>< pics>

This was our place to have lunch in Palm springs. It looks like the management had changed. The fish tacos they were known for were cold. The tortillas were hard. The service less than average.<//review>

(Translated by Google) A restaurant with oysters! Cheerful staff and good service. Only the terrace seats in Corona came out crispy, whether there was some room.
