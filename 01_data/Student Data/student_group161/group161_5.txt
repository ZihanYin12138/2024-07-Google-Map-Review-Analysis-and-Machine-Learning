Came here for dinner followed by a comedy show. I thought I'd try the BUNNY CHOW, both because of the name, and also because it sounded the most uniquely South African. I heard it's quite popular in Durban. Well, when they tell you that you have a loaf of bread filled with curry, I imagined something like a baguette or bread bowl. Something round and crusty. Nope, this was like a proper store-bought loaf of bread with a hole dug out the middle!
It was yummy, and I think everyone else around me enjoyed their dinners as well.
The comedy show was fun, too!
Casual atmosphere, kind of a random location out by the furniture stores!< /Text>

I love this place! I panicked when I saw the Cape Town Cafe sign come down, but they still have my favorite dishes on the new menu. I have been in the US much more of my life than I was in SA, but this is still comfort food all the way.< /Text>

Got out with a very bad taste...

I visited Capetown several times in the past now. Had been there yesterday. I must say that the food there is great, but the service is poor and we will never come back. I made an order with the waiter and specifically pointed with my finger to the dishes I ordered, because once an error was made with my order. The waiter did not write the order on paper and brought me one dish twice instead of once. When I complained, the waiter said he will check and never came back. I went to the register to ask, and the person in charge (possibly the owner) replied "I remember you. You came here 4 times. You once made a mistake with a dish costing $24. This time you will pay in full." I was appalled by this treatment and by the public humiliation. Needless to say, I will never come back, and I advise you to do the same.</Review>

<Time>1450496410459< /Time><Text>Dinner on Friday night. Casual, upbeat atmosphere and helpful, personable service. The peri-peri wings (one of several items featuring this peppery, flavorful sauce) are a wonderful place to start exploring the varied menu. Meat pies are savory with a little spice, and pair well with thick-cut fries infused with malt vinegar and salt. The brandy tart is tremendous: crisp, but with a cake-like texture and soaked with a brandy sauce and topped with caramelized sugar. Make sure you have someone to share it with you.

Great experience. Will be coming back. Tomorrow.<//Text><username>Jesse Tingle< /username><GmapID>0x80dbf8b5423065d5:0x588f01d61800651f</GmapID>< Pictures>

<review>So you know. They are changing their name officially in October, but already have the signage that has the current/old name. It will now be called something like the Malt Bar or something similar.

They are under new ownership, but they told me they are keeping a lot of their current South African fusion recipes. That makes me happy since I about Ely LOVE their peri peri wings and chicken quarters! Beware, they are pretty hot, but soooo worth the pain! If I were to host a party that warranted chicken wings, I would order these for it when I wanted something different.

Their desserts are also in point. I have tried all of them in the past, and I have to say their brandy tart is my favorite. They give you a generous amount, too, and is easily shared between about 2-3 people.

Seriously, if you want to try something different, this restaurant is a great place to go in the Miramar area. They don't disappoint< /review>< pictures>

Tried the sampler platter and boboti. Everything was excellent!  Meat pies, samosas and sausages were so fresh and home made.   Boboti was unlike anything I've tried before - fluffy egg on top of sweet and savory beef, full of flavor.   Definitely worth it and will be back for more!<//Text>

Great place to buy Biltong or Droewors, but I went twice in the last year and both times they were out of it. Not a biggie, except I live in Salt Lake City, UT. I, both times, made an hour detour to pick some up, without any there. The food is great, prices are a bit steep, but I would and will still go to buy some more biltong.<//Text>

<Review>Wow. So good. Tonight was my first time here and it was delicious. I was with a large group so got to try a little bit of everything. Sausage and lamb were decent. Pari pari was delicious on chicken and prawns. Samoosas were delicious, meat pie was great. And the cinnamon custard was amazing. Service was super friendly and helpful. Definitely will be back, probably soon!!<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Love, love, love the NEW owner of CapeTown Restaurant - welcoming, friendly, (...what a pleasant change from previous owner!)

We had a table of 17, great service & the food came out hot. Everyone had their South African favorite. The steak sandwich I had was awesome & I can highly recommend the signature lamb curry.  We had two vegetarian family members who enjoyed the vegetable bunny chows & the potato samosas (off the Sampler Platter). The Sampler Platter is a good deal - a taste of most of the popular South African foods - meat pie, sausage roll, boerewors, & peri peri chicken. On the gourmet chicken & mushroom pie I overheard the comment,  "I want one of these pies every day!"

My son in law enjoyed the beer on tap & for me the vanilla cream soda on tap is a great substitute for the "original" South African Spar-letta cream soda.

I'll definitely be back soon for the Sample Platter & to try out new dishes that are going to be added to the menu.</Text>< name>

This atmosphere is really nice here.  The employees are very friendly.  We had the meat platter, but they were out of the lamb which we really wanted to taste.  We want to go back to try the meat pies.  We went late, and per other reviews they run out, so we didn't even ask.  We had the peri wings, and they were ok.  Samossas were amazing and the sauce it came with it was delicious.  We will go again a little earlier for the meat pies, and more samoosas.</text>

<Review>The service was excellent here. We came to watch the World Cup USA soccer game and had a table reserved for 16 as erquested. Thanks for that! The food was different and very enjoyable. My only 2 requests are: 1. Install more tv's around the whole place so the back tables will be more utlized during games, and 2. write descriptions on the menu so that we don't have to bombard the waitstaff with a ton of questions. Maybe even use more photos in the menu. This way we know what the interseting named food is. Overall I like this place. I would certainly come back and recommend!<//Review><date>1403025755544< /date>< pictures>

<text>Lamb wrap with slap chips, glass of chenin blanc.

This is one of my favorite meals in San Diego. I work nearby, so I find myself gravitating to Cape Town quite frequently. The lamb wrap is a lamb-curry burrito, with potatoes and rice. If you're interested for a really unique flavor, ask for a bottle of their peri-peri sauce. Their peri-peri sauce has got a good heat, and very distinct taste.  I love a good potato side, and the slap chips are pretty awesome. They're like thick potato wedges with a soft interior, with a touch of vinegar.

It's got distinctive culture. It's well decorated, and has a market (snacks, wines, and souvenirs) at the side of the restaurant. You often hear some South African accents who come to have some of their native cuisine.

They've also got some interesting programs. As a regular, I use their loyalty program. I think they're also doing deliveries, but I can't attest to that personally.

Definitely check out their lamb wrap and their peri-peri sauce. Also great: half-chicken with side salad (really good deal), peri peri chicken salad (a healthy option for when you've had too much of their lamb wrap)! I've gotten a number of my coworkers hooked on the lamb wrap; it's a solid plate.</text>< response>

Not enough 45 pound plates at this gym.  Often times I need to search clear across the gym just to find a plate.  LA Fitness does a much better job equipping their gyms with an adequate number of plates.<//Review>

This was a great gym when we started gluing here years ago but they closed the kids club (one of the main reasons we chose 24 hour) and now with all the COVID requirements and limiting workout times I will be switching back to Crunch because it's a fraction I'd the price and now they're pretty much the same after most of the amenities have been removed or heavily modified by 24 hour. Not to mention they filed bankruptcy which doesn't bode well for the future. Give them a try to see if you like it but it just doesn't work for us anymore especially at the price point of membership.</text>

Beware of Bruce the trainer! He'll stop training his clients to come tell you to not slam "slam balls" and to not set down weights when deadlifting. He will also go to the extent of recruiting a nearby 80yr to help him with the arguement that he can hear the weights on the ground. Globo Gym problems.</text>

Unfortunately, much of StairMaster and treadmill equipment in the gym needs major and immediate repair to eliminate the restricted access for many of us members.
Staff is nice but they get sub optimal support.
The problems were identified for a long time and addressed to management though very little was done to fix it.</text>

<text>Been going here for years. they updated the place about 4-5 years ago, so it's fairly nice inside.  There's always the issue of going at "prime time" - from about 2/3pm till early evening. It's just too crowded for my taste during those hours. So I go on Saturdays. Overall, the have  nice equipment, a nice locker room, and it's overall clean.</text></record></dataset><record>

I was in the middle of doing ten push ups when trainer Bruce Perkins asked me to move my mat. I said I would when I was done with my set and he got very upset with me and in my face. I shouldn’t feel intimidated by a personal trainer at this gym. Especially being a women who already has a hard time lifting weights with the boys. I have never felt
So much disrespect in a gym and this was by an employee.<//text>

<review>Be careful when signing up for a plan at this gym. They will try to overcharge you. Also, the max they will give you to try is 3 days. Do yourself a giant favor and sign up at any other location. My rates are the same as what they quoted me here but 2 levels (supersport) higher. That's right. If I signed up at this location, under the supervision of the manager, I would be paying for an active what I now pay for super sport. Also, the Bella Terra location allowed me a two week trial. Complete bummer!</review>< time>

Really well kept facility with good quality equipment, lots of space, and a surprisingly quiet atmosphere. The staff here are pleasant and the clientele are genuinely there to work out without being obnoxious. The bathrooms could use some more cleaning and the hand dryers are super close to the floor.</Review>

The staff is excellent, especially the Kids Club workere and the GM is very friendly.  My only complaint having previously come from a Super Sport is the lack of space and at times equipment. A basketball court and pool would also be nice but overall I'm pleased.<//Text>

We like going to the gym early in the morning,  so being open 24 hours is important to us.  Is usually clean, but they occasionally run out of paper towels.  They recently increased the lighting at the door,  which wasn't necessary.  It's actually pretty annoying,  but since we don't hang out there,  it's not a big deal.  If we don't go with our regular early morning crowd, it does get crazy busy later in the day.<//text>

This is the best gym in the world.  The gym rats are friendly and share their wisdom with whomever asks.  Don't judge a book by its physique. Lol</Review>

<Review>This gym is close to where I live and the staff are very friendly. It gets fairly crowded but never have to wait more than 10 minutes to use the squat rack. Noticed a lot of people let you work in with them. This 24 hour fitness has a good atmosphere.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This is one of my favorite gyms. Its not a super sport but sometimes it feels like it is. Lots of weights and machines. No pool and no towel service. The only problem with this gym is the dirty sauna that never gets hot enough and the shower walls are very dirty as well.</Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Love this Gym. The staff is warm and friendly. It is clean and the equipment is maintained. I moved to the OC  3 years ago and had to leave the 24 hour fitness that I had used for over 10 years. I tried 7 different 24 hour fitness’s in the OC and they were awful. I had thought about switching to the Crunch when I was told about this 24 hour gym on Warner. I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did.< /text>< gmapID>

24-Hour Fitness in Huntington Beach, Warner
and Springdale has all you need to achieve your goals but they do not have a towel requirement when using
all their equipment. When you go to use the exercise equipment after someone else has just used it! they always leave a gross sweaty
Machine. This is very unsanitary and sickening!!! I am amazed management at 24 Hour Fitness does not require a towel when using the exercise machines.<//text>

this is actually NOT so much about the fitness center as it is about their ALLEGED SECURITY GUARD in the parking lot, so I won't give a one-star evaluation...I will leave it in the middle.. I was just visiting the area, and am a member at the fitness center , but after a long day at the HB AIR SHOW and church,after a quick workout I returned to my vehicle , but was TOO TIRED to drive  for the time being so I ddecided to take a nap in the back of my van. It was only about 6pm, so I figured I would nap a few hours then start my planned trip up north. However, around 730 pm I heard an EXTREMELY LOUD POUNDING OR RAPPING on my window..I was sleeping so deeply it took me a few moments to wake up and realize where I was and what was happening. I ddragged myself up to the driver's seat and saw this VERY WHITE security guard (I'm white too, but there's a big difference between normal white versus "very white", and a certain sort of entitlement based on being white) staring thru my window from his white pickup truck...when he saw me he put the BRIGHT LIGHTS ON ME.. and walked over , and seemed to be TRYING to be nice but was saying that I couldn't "CAMP OUT " here. I remained polite, not argumentative, and said "Thanks but I was just taking a nap" ..he seemed already at the firm conclusion that I was "camping out" even though it was only 730 in the evening. Such a conclusion seems VERY PREMATURE at such a time of day. Nonetheless, I kept my thoughts to myself. He did NOT even ask if I was going to the fitness club or Del Taco which is right next to it. He seemed to be the JUDGE JURY & EXECUTIONER of my plan & purpose for being where I was. My OTHER CONCERN was whether or not he was ACTUALLY the security guard for this parking lot or just a "vigilante" .  He had a jacket with some sort of logo on it, and had a truck with a few special lights, but not much markings.  Some time ago I had an encounter with a "fake security guard" elsewhere, so YOU NEVER KNOW.  Anyways, with this kind of person already having his mind made up I learned long ago to NOT ARGUE or try to change their mind . I started my car and planned to leave. Meanwhile, he played the part of watching my every move, making sure I ACTUALLY LEFT the parking lot where I had only been for an hour or so by that time. Then he drove the same way I was driving for a mile or two towards PCH, eventually turning off. Where are these kind of security guards and police when there are REAL BAD GUYS? Lord have mercy.<//review>

I am giving 3 stars for this branch which needs a serious update, but I don't give more than 1 star to the chain! I was a long time customer and I see this branch is doing better than other branches I visited in HB, SCM, TO but it's still not up to my expectation because I got the feeling that the headquarters customer service should honor the old signed club members and keep that rates as agreed when the contract is signed!<//text>

They’ll scam and charge you even though you’ve clearly told them 3 times that I want to freeze it and they still charged . And when I told them I want to end the member ship and a couple months after they still charge me. And did the same to my brother and friends .<//review>

I go to Mondays Yoga class with Cheri. She is an excellent Authentic Yoga Teacher who teaches a great class with positvivity and grace. I give it 5 star. For that teacher wish she taught more there..  The 3 is for the newer yoga teachers  man who are not well tranied play no music and talk too much during class giving advice  and rambling on and on  and it is just aNegative ezp.i have seen several walk out on this class, tmi stopped going to that class.  Please hire well trainned yogis this is a serious practice i understand some are new and etc, but there are really great seasoned yoga teachers in the HB community.</Text>

I’ve been taking my vehicle to first Nissan for years and have had a great experience but my last visit wasn’t a good experience at all.  Just a few weeks after I got my truck back, I started to hear noises from the engine and when I opened the hood, I discovered that the caps for the coolant reservoir and the windshield washer fluid were both missing.  I took a closer look and found there was nothing in the coolant reservoir.  I then checked my oil level and discovered that it was very low. I had to add three bottles of oil to bring it up to the proper range.  This fixed the noises I had been hearing.   It appears their tech only did half the job that I paid full price for.  Not long after that, my engine just stopped while i was driving.  Fortunately I wasn’t on the highway so I was just able to pull over and restart it.  Since then it has died two more times. This never happened before I took it in.</text>

I traded in my Nissan Titan 2012 for a new Titan XD with Cummins turbo-diesel engine. Fairness and respect are the words that come to mind. Everyone treated me well and made buying my fifth new Nissan a pleasure.<//Review>

Greg and the other techs were extremely helpful and professional. In contrast to associates at Gardena Nissan, which didn’t understand Nissan’s warranty rules, Greg explained Nissan’s policies after taking the time to verify with the manufacturer. His positive attitude, knowledge, and sense of service to the customer, both on the phone and in person, are what an ideal service associate should possess.</review>

Robert Martel Service Manager is exceptionally knowledgeable, courteous, and trustworthy.  I've been working with him for over 22 years.  Even after I moved to Port Hueneme which is a 40 minute drive 7 yrs ago I continue to  go to Simi for all my service needs.   He's always treated me like a VIP. All my vehicle purchases have been made from 1st Nissan and they have all been new.  It's important to service your vehicles on their recommended schedule.</text>

My car needed quite a few things done, it was expensive as there was so much that needed to be done but no one knows my Nissan better, and I’m so excited to say my car feels like new! It hasn’t driven this well since I first bought it and makes it all worth it! With the long list of things that needed to be done they got everything done in a day so I didn’t have to worry about not having a car. I had a tire coming apart from the inside and Rafael was genuinely concerned for me and my safety and wanted to make sure I got the tire fixed under warranty as soon as possible. I really appreciated that, and will definitely return in the future!</Text>

<Text>The service team at this particular Nissan dealership is outstanding, as is their work. They’re very personable, easy to talk to. It’s quite clear that they are accustomed to dealing with people and that they also enjoy the interaction. This time, Scott got me squared away with everything I needed. My car was thoroughly inspected, aligned, serviced and ready within a matter of hours for my upcoming cross country road trip. I love the service here.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_id>

Mr Martel, the manager and the technicians did a great job on my vehicle. I was given a loaner car for two days to get to work and back home until my car was ready.
My car was detailed and cleaned after they completed the work. My car runs smoothly and accelerates now. Mr Martel will break down what my car will need and explain each situation. He does a great with customer service!
Thank you All!< /Review>

There is a Fast DC charging station on the property. It is paid, so I do not quite understand why it is only for Nissan Leaf cars. Well, I understand the owners want to make it available for their fleet during business hours, but I do not like that they enforce it after hours when it is not being used. It happened this evening, I was driving my Tesla Model 3, and the car was running out of juice, the battery had only a few miles left. This Chargepoint charger was the only fast charger around that I could use. I paid for the session, I was not stealing your electricity. I saw some employees driving by and entering the building, they saw me, and shortly after, somebody completely shut down the station before the session I had paid for was over. That is rude!<//review>

<Review>I bring my 2010 Cube for service at this dealership. They provide good customer service upon arrival.
I usually do not wait for my car, so if I don't have a ride, I use their courtesy shuttle to be dropped off at home or other locations while my vehicle is being worked on.
They text you on the progress of your vehicle, and the service advisor will call you if anything comes up on the service requested while they're working on the vehicle.
Any questions I've had on the inspection summary, they've always answered. Usually my car is washed before its returned and the cashier is pleasant when paying for my service upon pick up.
I receive a survey via email afterwards and any issues can be taken care of through this survey too. I enjoy having my vehicle serviced at this dealership.</Review>< name>

I really enjoy my experience going to 1st Nissan for service.  A nice waiting room that makes the time go by comfortably.  I am kept up to day with the progress of my service.  I feel like family.  This is why I drive from the Valley to Simi to have my service done right.< /text>

I have been a customer of 1st Nissan since I bought my car in November 2014
The service department is awesome. Chris was my service guy from day one until just recently as he left 1st  Nissan. I am now working with Robert. Robert has assisted me in the past and I like him as he is all about the customer, and is all about providing an excellent customer experience. If you are looking for a new vehicle,  or for a dealership to service your Nissan,  I highly recommend 1st Nissan of Simi Valley for all your needs.< /review>

<review>Nothing lacking at all! Robert kept me up to date & could have easily upsold me but he didn't. I was concerned about my brakes, but he showed me that they were fine. He did find that my battery was weak but was under warranty, so I only had to pay 25% of the cost. Comfortable waiting room.

My Salesman, Noah, was so very helpful, kind and a great listener.  He went above and beyond to help me find everything I wanted in a new car.  My Sales Manager, Dinesh, was wonderful to work with.  Also, my Finance Manager, Henry, was extremely helpful and everyone worked so well together as a team.  I could not have been happier.  My late husband had bought two cars from your dealership in the recent past and I am glad that I chose to come to First Nissan straight away in my search for a new car.<//text>

<Review>As always, Chris was very polite, friendly, and professional.  He was on top of everything from the moment I drove in.  Kathy, the cashier, is a gem!  Keep her at Nissan and don't share her with Honda :)

Thank you for finally listening to my surveys!!!  I have been saying for over a year now that it would be great to vacuum the carpets and wipe down the windows.  I was nicely surprised!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I know very little about cars and Chris was so helpful. When giving me a quote he told me what was absolutely necessary and what could wait a bit longer so I didn't feel like I was being pressured into spending more money, which a lot of mechanics or body shops tend to do. I also got a free ride to work and was able to come pick up my car later from the showroom which was much more convenient than coming back before 6 durring traffic!<//text>

Robert was a great service writer, took my notes  about my concerns about my car and Scheduled my appointment. I wanted my transmission serviced due to the mileage. But I also wanted my concerns documented.  A transmission service includes a filter but they did not put a new one in according to work order so this is why im giving low scores.</text>

When I was introduced to Pedro I was told that "Pedro would take good care of me" and that he did!  What impressed me the most is that Pedro not only listens, he "hears" what you have to say, especially when it comes to what you want and what you can afford.

In this day and age of millennial "it's all about me" Pedro stands out as one who cares about his customers.

First Nissan of Simi Valley has a new customer.</review>

This happens quite a bit. Last time I had my car serviced for transmission, I noticed that the digital readout on the dash that shows general mileage info, MPG efficiency, etc. seemed to have been disconnected, or at the very least had stopped working after the transmission replacement. I had mentioned if somebody could take a look at this to see what the issue may have been. I was met with "that would mean taking the steering wheel apart" and a separate diagnostic to see what the problem was. It would be nice, JUST ONCE, for somebody to actually go out and LOOK at the problem to see what MIGHT be the cause, rather than jump to charging me for a diagnostic!!< /Review>

Over all service and customer care > Everyone is very attentive and knowledgeable.
at anytime if they aren’t quite sure of any question I have they look into it right away and get back to me so very promptly this is also if I’m on phone.
I have recently seen and dealt with Chris and he is very helpful and follows through with my service needs very promptly and reliable.
I know when he is there it adds a extra layer of security for me to know My car is in good hands.
I apologize I don’t remember everyone’s  names.
Raphael and Robert are also very good - seriously i have never dealt with a bad employee all including Chris are very respectful and Courteous.

I liked the fact that my service rep knew my names, and the service history of my car. He read my input and history and I felt he was on top of it. Also the estimate and costs were competitive and compared close enough to other shops. I would recommend them to others, and the only way for a perfect score would be for free service.<//Review>

<Name>Laura Spencer< /Name><text>Took my 2017 Rogue here to have a front license plate bracket installed but I also had other concerns /issues. Rafael blew off my concerns, says issues are ‘normal’ REALLY? Car is still under warranty but he just couldn’t be bothered. No issue charging me $100 for part and labor for a bracket that took 5 minutes to install. I really hate that there is no other local Nissan dealer. For a company that says their customers come first, it’s really disappointing. Oh, and Brian doesn’t respond to messages either. Maybe a new service manager is needed.

ETA - No one responds when you're asked to email them so they can resolve your issue with their service.  BTW - my car still has a major issue that Rafael says is no big deal.  Time to drive into the valley to another Nissan dealer and see if they are willing to help since First Nissan isn't.< /text>< userid>

I did not buy my car from this dealership, but they have been a great local dealership for me to get routine maintenance done. This is my second visit to First Nissan, but on both occasions I received great service from the second I pulled up. They were quick to get me set up so I could relax and wait for the service to be done. They also offer a complimentary shuttle service that will take you to most places in Simi while you wait. Both times I brought my car in for service, it was ready within the hour and it was freshly washed. Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of customer service and the quick turnaround of my car.< /Text>

<text>Kim Ewing at First Nissan in Simi Valley went above and beyond to help me with my new Nissan Versa.  He gave me a great deal on my trade-in.  He helped me pick a car perfect for my needs.  He explained what I was getting and made what would normally be a big ordeal for me, a fun and relaxed experience.  It was a pleasure to get my car at Nissan, and I'll return again when I get my next car.  I really feel that Kim has my best interests at heart, and that I can trust him and the group at Nissan.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1536594756419, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review, Susan!

We just bought a 2014 Rogue. We really like the car with all it's options, more than Honda, Toyota & Hyundai in the same category. Yes, we drove all those cars. Daniel Bradbury, our sales rep, was not only knowledgeable but enthusiastic and just plain nice to work with, a huge plus in the business. His manager, Kim Ewing, was equally good to deal with and the Finance Manager, Henry Sanchez made things move very smoothly< /Text>

I tried other dealerships close to us, but we were just not getting the customer services that we were looking for. Here they never tried to push a sale on me of unwanted parts.

After test driving 3 cars, they went over all my options to lease or buy in a friendly manner and provided me some great deals. I'd definitely recommend them!</Text>< name>

We originally went to 1st Honda to look at Honda Civics/ CRV's but no one bothered to talk to us as we walked the new and used car lots at Honda. We were finally contacted by Ryan who works at the 1st Nissan dealer and began a conversation about what types of car/suv my wife was looking for.    Ryan took the time and showed us the Rogue/ Rogue Sport and all the amenities each model possessed. After his demonstration of all the vehicle had to offer we were impressed with the SUV. We did not even do any research on the Rogue SUV and didn't know the value for the cost of this vehicle. So in the long run we had a long but pleasant transaction with the purchase of the Nissan Rogue. In the end, we purchased the vehicle and was extremely happy with the outcome and customer service with the sales/ financial staff.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I am so disgusted with this place. I feel Nissan should not allow this dealership to use their name. The Sales Manager has absolutely no manners as to how to speak to a customer. Today morning I went down with my family to car shop. we did not want a color they had, but we were ready to compromise if they would have given us a good price. the salesman went back and forth with us on the price but we were not convinced. Finally we gave him a price but he was not convinced with that. We were walking towards our car, when the manager Robert Ruiz approached us and started negotiating a deal but we were not interested. He became a little aggressive and started abusing (used F*** words). I was astonished listening to this. I asked him to stop abusing but on top of everything he became racist to me.

I was so taken back with the way I was treated. A simple "sorry sir, we cannot sell you at this price" was sufficient, there was no reason to abuse and treat us like this.

I am so pissed with them and have decided to switch from Nissan to some other brand. I would strongly advise to not approach this dealership, if you want to buy Nissan. Even if you have to drive to Valencia or some other Nissan dealership.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>From the moment I walked in the staff was very attentive, Your service advisor, Rafael Martinez, explained in detail the costs and what the service would entail.  He also made sure the shuttle service was ready waiting for me when I needed to be given a ride back to work. A couple of hours later, Mr. Martinez called me to let me know my vehicle was ready and took the opportunity to explain the great condition your technicians found my car in, how the results of the battery came back, all the warranties that are still covering my vehicle, he really made me feel that Nissan had my back and I had made a good decision in investing into the maintenance of my car. He offered the shuttle to pick me up from work, I never felt this 5 star service anywhere. When I arrived we went over the results of the 45k mile service and he personally walked me to where I could take care of the bill. Everything felt organized, not rushed and made me feel like I was their most important customer. I will definitely bring my car for service again.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The service itself is exceptional. Mayra Lopez is the reason I chose first Nissan. She helped me from the beginning and answered every question I had, and then some. First Nissan has a reputation for service and quality. I got the exact car (370Z Sport) I desired and for the price that was within my budget. I think who ever is motivating this crew of staff might just be in the right thing because other companies are very pushy and at times annoying. This crew however, knows when to get my attention and listens to me when I give them a time frame for contact. If I was the boss, I would consider showing my sincere appreciation by rewarding those who are clearly doing the job correctly. Thanks again staff of First Nissan, and thanks again to Mayra Lopez for your internet service.< /Review>

Everyone was very positive, it took three visits to figure out which one we really would like to have.  Billy gave a price that was what we expected to pay, 36k, okay, 35,995 for a 2017 Sport Tech 370Z.  By the way it now has over 150 miles on it today, Friday. :)  So much for the seldom used sports car idea.</review>

This is the first time my husband and I buy a brand new car. We were still worried and apprehensive about being overcharged or feel pressured to purchase something less than amazing.
Needless to say, I showed up with a check issued by my credit union with low interest (been banking with them +18 years and have credit +780) but guess what!  We almost dropped to the floor when we found out we could actually finance the car through their lender for an even lower interest rate!! The salesperson, Brian C. was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and chilled. What else can I say... We are just so so so impressed and happy:)<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I had a fantastic experience here. Their freindly, knowledge, want to please the costumer and most important they do not continuously lie and badger you to buy something you dont want like i ran into at a few other dealerships.
I bought my new Rogue at First Nissan after visiting 4 other Nissan dealerships plus other brand dealerships. This is the place to find what you want Without the headache of pushy, lieing salesmen. Plus my experience was pleasant with all departments...financing to signing my papers.
I was ready to go to a car broker like i have with my previous 2 cars due to the fact of salesmen trying to sell me what i didn't want, when i was upfront and very specific with my needs and wants. And being female it makes it harder to shop for cars......But not at First at Nissan !!!<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Nice people, but they are car salesmen. Expect a continuous pitch for what the staff wants to sell rather than what you want to buy. I was told I would be done in less than an hour. Over an hour an a half later, I walked out the door with my car. Not bad, but still a bit deceptive.< /review>< pictures>

Leaf Drivers beware: I planned a trip through Simi Valley in my Leaf. I planned to charge at First Nissan, which is the only available Quick Charge anywhere close to the area. Unfortunately, even though this charger is listed on Chargepoint and PlugShare as available, it is not operational. When I went in for assistance, I was greeted with total indifference and a couple of excuses. When I used to work behind a counter, I would at least go online and see if I could find a solution for a customer. But not here at First Nissan. One salesman suggested that I could go over to the Chevy dealership and see if they could help me. Another salesman made an excuse:"well, we didn't even have the charger last month". Yes, and in that case I wouldn't have planned my trip around it since it wouldn't have been listed as installed and operational. I would have thought that Nissan would have some sense of understanding that an EV driver can't just pull up to the next gas station. We rely on the very few charging stations here and there. I know that things happen and that chargers go offline, but the thing that disappointed me was that these sales fellows just didn't care. Wasn't their problem. Their commissions are based on sales, not follow through.< /Review>

<Date>1529936022081</Date><text>I guess Nissan doesn’t care about the safety of their customers. I have a broken passenger and rear passenger seatbelt and through a lifetime seatbelt warrenty that I already got confirmed through Nissan Corp. to confirm my car qualifies for it. For over 2 months I have tried to get Simi Nissan to fix it but they tell me they couldn’t get the part that I manage to find on Nissan’s part website in less than 5mins and that I should tamper the seatbelt system (if i do it takes my car off the warrenty). Finally, manage to talk to the service director Brian Dully he said he’ll contact me once he received information on when the belts should arrive, but he never did and I tried calling him leaving him a voicemail to contact me back but never did. It’s been almost 3 months since I’ve tried to get my sealtbelt fixed for safety, but I guess First Nissan doesn’t care since they have to do it for free and won’t make money. They just keep blowing me off or telling me things to try to take my car off warrenty. Thanks First Nissan : - ) you really care.<//text>< Resp>

When we did not respond, he started making racist remarks and started abusing my country. Well, the thing he doesn't know is that my country is also US of A!
Telling me to go back to my country. This guy and dealership could be sued. I won't ever buy a Nissan.<//Text>< Pics>

They were horrible. I found a car off of CarGurus, and contacted them through the site. They then emailed me the info on the car with the savings, and I thought it was awesome so I called and they assured me that they had 3 Altima's there just like it. After work I drove to simi and when I got there, they said there was no way they could sell it for the price it was listed for in their email and acted like they didn't send it. Total waste of time.< /review>

Its this kind of client focus that keeps me bring my Maxima back to 1st for all of its service. I had a issue with my dashboard gauges after having warranty repair on my dashboard due to a rattle.  The service desk staff was having a hard time understanding my issue so Brian, the service manager took over.  He listened to my story, made sure he understood the problem, and then tested the car to verify the issue. Brian worked up a solution that, in my mind, was the reasonable path forward and I appreciated that.  He also took an extra step in helping keep all of my car keys synchronized after I replaced a lost key, however then found the lost key.  I have to admit I was annoyed that my car was having problems immediately after having the rattle fixed and Brian in every helped make this a non-issue for me.</text>

By Stephen Galvin: After 21 years it became necessary to replace my '97 Nissan King Cab. I went into the Simi Valley Nissan dealer with a sour attitude. I really only wanted to confirm that my choice to replace the blown engine in my '97 was rsight. I wanted proof that they wouldn't listen to my "low dollars, no extras" demand.
They did not have a pick up that was low and stripped enough for me, but they did introduce me to the Nissan NV200--a total surprise and it met all my needs. It hit my price, my equipment needs, my limit on extras--AND it gave the bonus of an automatic, so my wife can drive it too.
I dealt with Eva. She did everything I asked for, got help when it was needed and followed through well.
Gvie them all 5 stars.<//text>

<text>This place is horrible. I bought my '09 Accord from here and less than 3 days later the battery died while I was at work. I called Dinesh who sold me the car and he was extremely rude to me as if it was my fault that they didn't do something simple like check the battery before they sold the car. He continued to tell me that I was young and unknowledgable and raise his voice during that conversation. They assured me that everything was checked and in order once I purchased the vehicle three days prior. I had to purchase a new battery from AAA in order to get back home and they did not reimburse me until weeks later. This incident occured in August of 2012. Now on April 2013 less than a year after I purchased the car I need new brake pads. Again, why wouldn't they make sure that the brake pads are all in working order and the vehicle will be ready for the customer yet assure you that they completely check the vehicle inside and out and it should be running brand new because of how "thorough" they are. This dealership is a joke. They clearly do NOT check their vehicles and just want to shove customers out of the door only for them to come back and pay for service repairs and parts for things they didn't check. Do not take buy your car here or take it here for repairs. You'll be sorry.<//text><time>1368550791814</time><response>None<//response><rate>2<//rate><gmap_id>0x80e82ec633daf3f1:0xea10d4ffc5322268<//gmap_id><userid>103602675878436650715<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<date>1463615413748< /date><rate>1</rate><Review>This review is about 1st Nissan service department! Over four years ago I moved to Simi Valley, and have been bringing my Nissan vehicle to 1st Nissan Simi Valley service department every 5,000 to 6,000 miles for routine maintenance, there was one recall issue, and also had a front window washer unit replaced. 1st Nissan became my go-to place for service. BUT NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE THEM. Here is why: Something changed with this service department over the past 6 months. They now seem to operate on a corrupt line of practice as you hear so often of so many other automotive service shops. They make claims of bogus problems that simply do not exist. I am sure they make a lot of up-sells $$$ on people that are naïve or simply do not know enough about cars and who fall prey to these tactics, but I have worked on all my cars most of my life from changing my own brakes, plugs and fluids to replacing timing belts to replacing entire engines. 6 Months ago I brought my vehicle in for routine maintenance, oil change, tire rotation and even asked them to change out all my air filters. The price was reasonable and I approved the work. When I came to pick up the vehicle the service agent told me there were two serious issues that needed immediate attention or could create a dangerous situation if left unrepaired. He told me that one of my engine motor mounts was broken, and that my timing belt was making noise and that both needed to be replaced (Total cost for both in excess of $1900). Many customers would probably trust the agent and likely pay for the “Needed repairs” and not think twice. I said I would have to think about it before I approved the work (Believe me, if I discovered the vehicle needed those repairs I would have done so). Of course I examined both and found nothing wrong, I even took my vehicle to a friend who is a mechanic and he confirmed that there was absolutely nothing wrong with either. Today 05/16/16 I again took my vehicle in for oil change, tire rotations, and also asked them to clean up the battery which had a little corrosion on the terminals, and (Also asked them to determine why my window washer reservoir was not holding fluid). The agent gave me a quote for all but the fluid reservoir, and I approved. When he called me, he said during their multi-point inspection they determined that my brake lines had “Dirty fluid” and that this would cause adverse pressure on the brake systems and cause faster wear on my pads and that they could replace my brake fluid for only $121. (Sounds very technical and expertise, right? What a line of BS! When I told my friend the mechanic he almost choked with laughter, and said how does an encased hydraulic system get dirty fluid), The service agent also said that while working on my battery that they noticed the “voltage was a little low and that they had another battery in stock and could easily replace it same day" (My battery is just over 1 year old, and works perfectly as the gauge on my console supports). Of course when I picked up my vehicle I asked the tech why during their multi-point inspection didn’t they notice a broken engine mount or timing belt today like they told me they found 6 months ago when I was last in for service? (I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT MY VEHICLE IS A 2008 WITH ONLY 67,000 MILES) I am explaining each claim with great detail because I want you the reader of this review to be prepared if you hear the same lines from them, maybe it will prevent others from paying for something that they truly do not need, like so many of people do. Please notice I didn’t mention any of the service personnel’s names. This is because I do not believe this is the fault of any one employee, but more likely the practice that plagues the entire operations of this business.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>R.I.P. Carol Anderson - May 12, 2017.
My mother died as a result of her front drivers side airbag not deploying. My parents were in a car accident they hit a tree doing 42 mph. My mother died as a result, her neck broken and lacerated heart. My fathers airbag on the passenger side did deploy hes alive and well. My parents bought a used 2011 Nissan Sentra from First Nissan. Why are all vehicles that have Takata airbags not recallled ?. Car manufacters know they defective and know Takata declared bankrupcy. They have known these airbags are defective since 2002. BEWARE of purchasing any used vehicle and go over throughly the warranty on the vehicle.  This all could be avoided if car dealerships were honest and cared about the safety of their consumers.

I have been researching and shopping for a Murano for about a week and was drawn in to other dealerships with "no haggle" internet sites like TrueCar and Edmunds. These services have become questionable because dealers manipulate other factors once you show up, such as adding hidden fees (a $1500 maintenance fee??), and manipulating interest rates(almost 6% with a 725 credit score--huh?),  so when you show up at the dealership, the bottom line price is not the great deal you think. I drove an hour for one of those deals, and was treated like I was trying to rob the place to get them to honor the deal.  After several terrible experiences, I checked out online reviews and saw that First Nissan in Simi had great customer satisfaction rates, so I emailed them with details of the deal I wanted. Mayra sent me an email and then called me inviting me into meet with the manager. I then got a call from Billy the manager, and was blown away by his friendliness (but not in the sleazy salesman sort of way), honesty and directness.  He offered me a great deal on the phone, and even after he had be hooked, continued looking for Nissan discounts and saved me an extra $10/mth.  Who does that? Other deals would have pocketed it.  I showed up  to the dealership and their were no games or..."oh you wanted car mats with that too?"  I received an extremely fair price and was treated like a valuable customer, all in record time of like 2 hours TOTAL.  That is the way a car sale should go.  Juan was my salesman and he could not have been a nicer, more professional guy.  He completed an orientation with me of the the car and its ridiculous breadth of features. His love and pride of Nissan cars and trucks was evident.  Brian the financial manager was also super friendly as we walked through the paperwork. I never buy dealer add-ons, but actually saw great value in service that repairs tires, replaces windshield, lost keys, and dings.  He probably got me at the right time as I have recently dropped a ton on all of these.  Either way, he was also non-pressure. I really can't say enough good things about this company and its people.  If you are looking for a different, better car-buying experience , call First Nissan.</Review></record>

I had an outstanding, positive experience with salesman Dinesh. I appreciated the no-pressure attitude from Dinesh. I felt like I went in, knowing what I wanted, and the sales team worked to find a new vehicle I wanted that fit my budget. They made me feel at home, offered me cold water and soft drinks, and made the experience effortless and relaxed. Dinesh was a professional and he never gave me the feeling that he was rushing me to make the sale. I keep my vehicles for a long time and love Nissan's. It may be a while before I get another one but I most definitely recommend this Nissan dealership to others. It's the kind of positive experience that leaves a great memory and is the way all dealerships should treat their customers. Thank you Dinesh

<review>I'm so glad I decided to purchase my 2010 Nissan Altima with First Nissan of Simi Valley.  I had shopped a couple other dealerships in the SCV and SFV areas and I did not get the same friendly approach like I did when I went to First Nissan.  Everyone that I came into contact with at First Nissan greeted me with a smile and made me feel important and right at home.  I need to send a BIG thanks to Sharon L. for getting the process rolling for me, as she put me at ease (buying a car can be stressful; however Sharon kept me relaxed) and a HUGE thank you goes to Kim E. as he really pulled a lot of strings for me, not to mention getting me a GREAT deal on my Altima and making the process seamless!  The finance department process was quick and painless!  I will refer all of my friends and family to First Nissan for their car buying needs.  I will also continue to buy my cars from First Nissan-They ROCK!!!! :)<//review><GmapID>0x80e82ec633daf3f1:0xea10d4ffc5322268</GmapID>< username>

What can I say... I am now and officially have been a Nissan guy. Go Team Nissan for life! So last year I had bought a 2015 base model Nissan Sentra and I was happy with it because it was my first real new car and it was great but I was a little small for me considering I'm 6 feet tall but I stuck with it. So after paying the car for almost 1 year on time I decided it was time to try and trade in for a bigger car like the Nissan Maxima but it's still out of my price range for now so I went looking for an SUV. My choices were the Rogue and Marano. I went look for a base model as I knew I could not afford a better model. So I met with Glen and almost everyone knows me at the dealership because I went there all the time drooling over the maxima that will be mine one day. So long story short I was trying to get into the Rogue but I was told that I might not be able to get into it because of how upside down I was on my sentra and there was not alot of rebates. Just when my hopes where almost gone Kim who I have worked with before came up with a better option. He said I could get into a 2015 Nissan Altima SV fully loaded minus the navigation. So I looked at the altima and I fell in love with it and decided to go that route and guess what.... I GOT APPROVED AND GOT MY ALTIMA. I am so happy that I was able to get into a bigger car and feel more like it's my car. I want to thank everyone at Nissan for helping me get my car and especially Glen and Kim for doing an excellent job. Now I can't wait to get my Maxima soon but for now I'm so happy with my Altima. Thanks guys your the best and can't wait for my Maxima one day..<//Review>

Managers Kim Ewing and Ron Giannoni took care of us and were watching out for our best interest. Sales man Matthew Zaragoza was amazing and explained everything about the 2013 Altima I was buying. Everyone involved made the experience pleasant and pain free. I've never had such an amazing and unbelievable experience buying a new car. I would encourage anyone looking to buy a Nissan to take their business to First Nissan, they are completely professional make sure they do everything in their power to take care of the customers. Jose Rivera, also took amazing care of us and ensured our Altima had full interior protection. He exceeded great service and is the only person I would deal with when it comes to service for my new Altima. If you need service of any kind for your car, make sure to see Jose because he will make sure he takes care of you.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I did a multipoint inspection check at this nissan dealership exactly before 4 weeks. This check was the most expensive one which costed me 450$ for 90k mileage. All they came back on that check is my tires are worn out. Which i can see by my own eyes.
But this is not the complaint i have.
Last week my cars timing belt was torn into individual threads (it did not just snap) which was caused by a lose tensioners. Because of which a thread from belt got wrapped around around the crank seal and the oil was leaking.
And the dealers state that the belt tensioner which was not loose until 90kmiles and got lose in those 3 weeks after i got it serviced from them which they claim to be thoroughly inspected. Now my money is wasted and i need to go to a different nissan dealer so that i can get it properly checked if there is any other surprise waiting for me in future.< /Review>

Let me tell you what happened. A friend of mine walks in because his headlight needed to be replaced. They were going to charge 300 dollars for a part that cost 75 dollars somewhere else, and they were going to charge 300 dollars for labor. It doesn’t take 300 dollars worth of hours to change a head light that take 15 minutes at most. If you don’t know anything about cars please get more then one estimate before you decide on a job. Do your research online as well. If you have a mechanic as a friend ask that person if you’re being ripped off. This dealership I’m sure runs off of commission so they want to rip you off so they can make more.</Review>

(Translated by Google) First and foremost, this was the fastest process! I was planning to buy until December, but I was curious about my credit. I spoke with Barbara from the beginning she was very kind and nice, she directed me to Kim Ewing and Jesus Mendoza who were just as friendly as her. They approved me in an agreement that was honestly too hard to resist. I have an incredible car. I will definitely keep my business in Nissan first. Thank you Barbara for the assistance and Kim and Jesus for making it possible. I LOVE MY SENTRA!

It's small but pretty. Too close to the main road to really enjoy it.</text>

It's a very nice quiet little park by the freeway. Just a great place to go relax or take a picture or two. I am typically there for the Pokemon Go Pokéstop and Gym, and for that, there is no better place.<//review>

<Review>Hidden, shaded, peaceful . Some people are getting this mistlin park mixed up with the mistlin sports park. The spark does not have baseball and volleyball and soccer mistlin sports park does that's on a different side of town FYI.

<Text>The upgraded potatoes were delicious. They add onions, parmesan cheese, roasted Brussel sprouts and bacon. I asked for it without bacon and they accommodated. The vegan fritata was pretty good but a little watery and not very "egg-y" but the vegan eggs Benedict was super delicious. The service was fantastic. Comped the kombucha flight when the waitress forgot to put in the order.  Ample outdoor seating at 2pm 1 hour before closing.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMqeU_YgYkr0j3UbZX2Gcqexemaj8E-55xOIaa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWkvfGo4XA1MS7GEe6oVLmWfZaMKdMmaoe9Vzu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMb4UD-ntEx0djzeSUcxEgCav1CtsSFCIcoA1al=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq_4P1ZTxpZyb97uEoPQrQcPmLCnR10UDt2P4i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN2a9LwjBhM7tlbHhBsLXmzuKcG7sPji6keGvt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Amazing food and service. It looks like a roadside fast food place but the food and the service are cordon bleu!</text>

Great farm to table breakfast restaurant in Costa Mesa! Amazing drinks and food. So much I wanted to order, all looked delicious. What's better than your breakfast coming out in your own mini skillet? Winner.<//Text>

Mr. Presley French toast is a must try here! And you can't go wrong with the fresh squeezed OJ mimosa too! Lovely and pleasant staff, all wearing masks. Outdoor seating with tables at least 6ft apart from each other< /review>

Good breakfast. The Portuguese sausage scramble is great. The Jalapeno sausage omelette is good. The cinnamon roll pancake was average with literally a powdered sugar and water blended icing. The banana sundae French toast was not that great, rather dry bread. The chilequiles were great with an over medium egg on top. The Jurassic Pork Benedict was good but the bacon is way too thick. The house ketchup is not good as it has a weird Tabasco flavor to it.</Text>

<Text>I’ve tried this place like 3 times for good measure. The food always LOOKS good & the idea of it sounds good but it’s almost always bland and tastes bad.. I got the strawberry cheesecake pancakes this time to be safe and it’s legit not even cheesecake tasting it’s just .. strawberries on regular pancakes lol. Stop advertising stuff that it’s not!!! And everything else I got was so bland.<//Text>< gmapID>

My friends had the chilaquiles which are crunchy and protein lover which included eggs, bacon, ham and cheese. My top off to this place.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv_Fo_OFvRCtdc56qy8hw2tPr5NH3oMUBscwlc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgzeM9xa2BnbJSoE8bSRcbON97lbyIZFR3gnck=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQCwe2zOWjAYp0LpaAdbPSLw-cc3JnYjV31q0s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN81hIQy1v0T6JwJHM8kdRtGFy7bcl1MNJKxfce=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcdfc03eb933b1:0xfc133009be220c99<//gmap_id></record>

The wait for 2 was about 35 minutes on a Sunday morning at 11, so very reasonable. Went for a birthday brunch and chose the bottle of sparkling with fresh squeezed juice and eggs benedict. My husband had the chilaquiles. There could have been a little more juice in the tiny carafe, and one of my eggs benedict was way overcooked with the yolk more like a hard boiled egg. Took a while to receive our ketchup, so I never really had the opportunity to send it back. I remember being much more impressed with the San Diego location and had really hyped it to my husband, so it was unfortunate that it wasn't what I was expecting.</text>< user>

<text>Terrible service. Myself and another couple put our names on the wait list. While we were waiting a group of 3 came up and were seated before us. They did not have a reservation. Once I was seated I did not get a menu or anything. 10 to 15 minutes later they finally brought me a menu. After I ordered a couple of more tables were seated. The tables that were seated after I ordered got their food before I did. Very disappointed with them. I will Not be going back to the Breakfast Republic.</text><resp>None</resp>< Date>

Food taste is really good. It takes tooo long for them to ask your order and even it takes longer to bring the check. I don't recommend here unless you don't have eternity to wait for the check< /review>

Extremely delicious food.

The service needs improvement. There is not much of an order to things. People get helped randomly, regardless when they were seated and how long they waited.< /review>

<Time>1593451183652</Time><rating>4</rating><text>Finally go around to trying this place, we were not disappointed. I was excited to get a morning mule only to find out they didn't have any ginger beer, so I had the screwdriver thing. I could have drank a gallon of it and been happy. Daughter had the Mexican mocha, which was good too. Wasn't a fan of the brewed coffee, only had one cup.

Daughter had the vegan breakfast burrito, which she said was pretty darn good.

I had the bacon jalapeño omlette, hold the garlic. The onions made it for me. The taters were ok. I loved the crispy ones.

I also went full fat man and subbed the toast for the lemon coconut pancakes. I was expecting this over the top lemon flavor, but what I got was a delicate and balanced pancake. I am not a big pancake guy, but I would try their other offerings based on those.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>First time coming here ... food was okay. I was upset the fact I asked for no bacon (pork) in my food, sub with turkey bacon. My eggs had both styles of bacon. Potatoes were cold . I will say I enjoyed the Cafe de olla.<//Text>< Pics>

Waitstaff and food was good.  I’d wait for the team to get things under control before visiting.<//Review><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Not worth the drive spent $50 left there hungry. The food was tasteless, the attempt to recreate amazing Mexican dishes falls short!<//Review>

<review>Oh my goodness, my daughter and I had the best consultant EVER, her name is Melissa Saldana! She is close to being a saint, having to deal with my inability to understand technology, which is only one issue she had to deal with. The day before I spoke to her on the phone and she was just delightful, informative, helpful and personable. But the service she provided today was exceptional!  She is so professional, answered all my questions and she further had to deal with my inability to figure out what I wanted, I kept going back and forth, but she kept helping me with patient understanding and exceptional interpersonal skills. She is such a valuable employee, I just can't thank you enough for having such an outstanding employee. She deserves to be recognized for her outstanding performance! Thank you so much, Tracy</review><Rating>5<//Rating>< response>

This man Joesph was amazing! His knowledge and customer service skills, in my opinion, through the roof! Why isn’t this man a manager of his own store??? Employees under him would run so smoothly and efficiently, his store would be top 3 in any region.
AT&T, you are lucky to have him on your team. I know plenty of business that would kill for a picture perfect, roll model employee like Joesph. Keep up the good work kid!
PS I’m said about sports being cancelled as well.

She was kind, helpful, and she even waited for us after we called ahead to make sure it would be okay for my family to come in to add the two new lines to my account. She went above and beyond by calling the online sales to help with an issue we had, and helped us get an even better plan than we already had for less money. She was knowledgeable, respected social distancing, and was a pleasure to work with. I hope she is considered for management some day soon, as she is exactly the kind of person I would love to see managing my local ATT.< /review>< Pics>

Melissa did an incredible job helping me transition to my new phone.  She was patient and understanding through the entire process.  I would recommend AT&T and Melissa if you are thinking of upgrading or changing your phone service.
Update: I had a billing problem and Liza corrected the problem. Very happy with this AT&T store!!!</text>

I had a very good experience with this store when I was ordering a new service. They set up a curbside service outside their store by the parking lot. Lessen exposure to covid 19. Also, Gio helped me a lot. Very knowledgeable and very friendly. Helped me a lot and answered all my questions confidently. I would recommend this store to all existing and new AT&T customers</Review>

The rep who helped me was very friendly and efficient. I want to make sure it is known when I replied to the survey I was at work, and accidentally clicked on 1. Highly dissatisfied
I meant to choose 5. Highly Satisfied I hope this is read by someone who can correct my survey to her credit.

Sincerely,
Laura Jones</Text>

I’ve had the best experience with The Flower Box in Dinuba.  Not only are their arrangements beautiful Paul has been absolutely wonderful to work with and extremely pleasant.  I’m from out of town and have used several high end flower shops and none of them have taken photos of the flower arrangements that were being delivered, and who accepted the flowers.
Very impressive!! I’ll be using The Flower Box every chance I get!  Thank you Paul and staff for a wonderful experience.  Worth every penny.< /Text>

I was extremely pleased with the customer service provided by Paul over the phone. I was even sent a picture of the beautiful flower arrangement that I had ordered and a text when it was delivered. I have ordered many flower arrangements over the years with various florists in Fresno and none of them had ever done that. I highly recommend The Flower Box.< /Review>

I would give them 10 stars if I could.  They produced a gorgeous custom arrangement that I ordered from out of state.  I was touched that they sent me a photo of the completed arrangement and texted me when it had been delivered.  Excellent customer service and talented florists!</review>

<text>Patricia was super nice and very helpful. She talked me through my options over the phone since I am not in the area and the website was down. Paul was kind enough to send me pictures via text and confirmation when the bouquet was received. The flowers were gorgeous. Very fresh and full. Very pleased, would highly recommend.</text>< Response>

I’m just thrilled with The Flower Box!  There customer service is 5 star ⭐️. I placed 2 orders over the phone and was given there full attention with help creating my funeral arrangements request.  Wished I lived closer as I would use them any chance I had!!
I was really impressed and they even sent me a picture of each arrangement.  Beautiful 😍 Highly recommend.</Text>

They did not have it, but described something similar. I ordered that and they delivered the same day. They kept me informed of my order and followed up after delivery.

<time>1563577150963< /time><rating>5</rating><review>Thank you so much Patricia for the beautiful arrangement you made for my Moms birthday. Not only was the arrangement beautiful but the service was amazing and very easy to place my order not to mention I received a picture of the flowers and was notified when they were pick up. I am from out of state and ordered on 7/18 and they had it ready for pick up the next day. I have ordered from the flower box for over 6 years now and they recently changed owners but their service is still amazing. I am originally from Dinuba and would recommend The Flower Box to anyone who needs a beautiful gift. Again thank you Patricia and Paul for the beautiful flowers.< /review>< pics>

<text>Due to cancelation of High School Graduations, I've decided to send flowers and balloons bouquets to some special graduates. The person who took my order was very sweet & patient. Which made the order very easy and quick. Days between my order and delivery, I received calls and text communicating confirmation of details. They also communicated when the delivery was successful! Because this was such an awesome experience, I plan to send out two more to other extended friends. Flower Box, thank you for helping me bring some joy to our graduates during these difficult & different times.<//text>< pictures>

Purchased an arrangement for my Mother at “The Flower Box” and they do not disappoint!  The arrangement was beautiful, and bountiful, with a great selection of flowers in my preferred colors.  💐🌷🌹💐. Patricia did a great job!  My mother loved it!!!  I have purchased arrangements over the years and have been very happy with each and every one. I Highly recommend.

<Text>I was looking for an arrangement as a thank you for a dear friend and found a beautiful design on the flower boxes website. I drove down to the shop and spoke with Paul and he was so polite and respectful of wanting to surprise my friend. He was so accommodating with the all of my request! I drove back down later that evening to give an address for the delivery and asked he they could take a gift card with the flowers as well and with no hesitation they were more than happy to help! I then spoke with Patricia and she informed me that some of the colors of roses were a little small at the time and asked if i would like a more bloomed rose and the color would only be slightly lighter, of course it was no problem with me and appreciated the offer. They then would update via text step by step from a picture for the final arrangement, when they were leaving, to when they were there and after dropping off. I have never experience such amazing service from a floral shop and highly recommend working with them for your next arrangement!!<//Text>< rating>

Wonderful experience working with The Flower Box over the phone; then, seeing in-person the results of their efforts. On this occasion we used them to provide a living floral arrangement for a memorial service in the area. Not only was their work beautiful, they communicated fully, including sending the attached picture and letting me know when the delivery was made. We were also present for the service and saw the fine work they did.< /review>

I live out of state but wanted to surprise my friend with birthday flowers. I called less than 24 hrs before wanting my order delivered. Patricia was able to help me with my phone order and guaranteed my order would ready for delivery the next morning. She quickly helped me pick my arrangement. I recieved a text with a picture of my order and another text when it had been delivered. It was a such an easy and great personal experience! I cannot believe I even considered using an online floral shop! I'm so glad I called.
Thank you so much! My friend loved her arrangement.< /text>

Absolute beautiful flowers and beautiful customer service! I’ve ordered numerous things for numerous occasions ranging in everything to birthday flowers to condolences arrangements, everything is always done beautifully! Patricia and her team add a tasteful, caring,  modern touch to everything that they do, including offering adorable home decor. They also have a wide arrange of prices to work with everyone and offer awesome add ons like adding rhinestones or butterflies to flowers and even air brushing flowers if you need a specific color! I can not rave enough about how much I enjoy this place and I’m sure anyone that visits will love them too!</review>

I wanted to order a bouquet to be delivered for the funeral of my co-workers mother.  I received wonderful service from The Flower Box.  I was calling from out of town and wasn't sure of all the details; so she called the funeral home for me and advised on when was the best time to deliver.  She was amazing.  No one takes that much care in retail anymore. She even sent me a photo of the bouquet once it was complete.  What a great idea that is!  She left me hoping that i have the opportunity to order from them again.  Thank you Flower Box!</review>

I really like the  place,  the owner/barber is a very  pleasant  gentleman. We are never at a loss for words.  He is very good at his work,  I'm always very satisfied. I always enjoy myself when I go.< /Text>

Jeff is an outstanding Barber. His rates are incredibly reasonable and never much of a wait. If your looking for a top notch cut, Jeff is your guy.<//Review>

If you don't know about Authentic Barbershop and Shave Parlor, then you've been sleeping on Jeff. First off, his establishment is clean. Minutes from the freeway and other of your shopping and diner needs. Whether for you, your kids, or a friend, you will leave his place extremely happy! And so will your loved ones! This guy is one heck of a barber. My youngest is 4. He has a hard time sitting still just like my oldest boy... They can't even sit still to eat lol. Not only was he patient with my squirmy and wiggly kids, he cut their heads for a good deal with efficiency, speed (look at the pics,) and it also came out fresh! Go in and check out the City Of Trees hidden gems of barbershops. You will be happy you did.</Review>

< Review>
Best hair cut I've gotten in Sacramento yet. Jeffrey knows his craft very well. When I was asked how I wanted my hair cut, I had really no idea, so I said for him just to use his own intuition on what would work best, and it came out perfect. The shop has a great atmosphere, the owner is good at what he does, and the prices are way too low for the amount of time and care that goes into each cut.<//Review>

Was in and out. One single chair in the entire place, meaning all the focus is on your hair, with the one guy.  When the place is called "Authentic", it's quite legit. To say the man is a professional with great precision would be an understatement. Will definitely return for a beard trim next time.< /Review>

<Review>The barber there was a punk. I walked in for a fade.  I said I wanted a one on the sides and the top the same length. He asked what legnth I wanted in between. It’s called a fade. You blend it. He’s a racist. Do not go here.< /Review><response>None</response>< user_name>

< Review>
Okay, I have been searching for a great BARBER for a while now. I have tried out a number of shops between Sacramento and Fairfield. Some got it close, and they all had the same info from me regarding how I want my hair cut, and some ....well....*I* had to fix they were so bad.

Jeff is the real deal.  A man who takes his craft seriously, and who treats every customer as if they are the only person in the world while you are in his chair.  I am a little picky (understatement of the year) about how my hair looks.  I am happy I can now end my search and am excited to have found my new Barber.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Luckily I found Jeff's place on Google maps nearby where I was at the time. I've been cutting hair for 24 years myself and am very picky about barbers.

I didn't tell him my experience but he cut my hair like he had ESP and knew exactly what to do. Usually it takes me forever to explain what I want and takes lots of trial and error but he got it right the first time and corrected everything without my input and cut perfectly.

I've never had a barber exercise the perfection every step of the way as did Jeff. This guys the real deal and I don't plan on going anywhere else for a haircut. I finally found a barber.

He's honestly the mad scientist of cutting hair. You know how the greats zone out and just accomplish their task with absolute precision. Ya, that's this guy. Very detail oriented, perfectionist style cutting.

You can tell he's intensely focused on doing everything right at a high professional level. Most barbers are very distracted but it seems as if this guy went through military style barbering camp where your life depends on perfecting haircuts or something.

Anyway, this guy's legit. My hair is very hard to cut because of many factors and he just killed it. I had to write this review for him so you guys can go to a real AUTHENTIC BARBER.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809ad93f877c71a9:0xe7b19842f56d47a9< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We love this little park
It's clean. Lots of seating. Shade and grass areas. Street parking only. Not a ton of traffic.<//review>

Fun big place to go to. A little busy sometimes, but overall great place. I did a Nerf war here, and for the bulk of the time, I didn't get to go on the playground, because little kids were there. Greatly recommended for parents of little kids, but not recommended for adults doing professional, competitive games.< /text>

<Text>This pool has been a great place for kids for many years. However rules are not being well regulated recently. Even basic rules, such as no alcohol, no glass container, no loud music, etc., should be common sense to all. I'm surprised to see how often these rules are neglected. The worst of all was a group of people, playing loud music from bluetooth speaker, drinking glass of wine in a kiddie pool!!! These violators should be banned! To people who check this review before coming to the pool, please respect rules to keep our community pool safe and fun place for everybody.< /Text>< pictures>

This was my first time to Uptown Nails and also my first time getting ombré nails. Katie did my nails and they turned out amazing. Love love love! Also love how they have all the safety measures in place during these times. I will definitely be returning to see Katie again. She did beautiful work and was very professional and personable.< /Text>

My daughter and I had our nails done by Katie( she did a full set on her) and Kim ( I had a gel manicure), both ladies were very professional and friendly and we felt very comfortable and pampered, even though we were a little early for our appointments, they had no problem accommodating us, I will definitely return for future services, thanks again ladies!<//Review>

< review>
Found this little place by accident, but I'm so happy I did. The employees here are very sweet and friendly. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing, not loud and chaotic like some other places I have been. My first visit was for a spa pedicure and an acrylic fill with gel polish. My toes looked so good--it was hands down the best my toe nails have ever looked and I've been getting pedicures for many years. My nails also turned out great and she was gentle with my hands when filing and sanding, which I appreciate! They have a very large selection of gel polish colors... even reds! It's always so hard to get a good red, but they have so many choices it was easy. I have been back several times since my last visit and continue to be very pleased with the service and quality of their work. Also, huge plus for me is that the are very efficient, not rushed, but they focus on their work so it doesn't take forever. I'm in and out in an hour!!!< /review>

I went here this past weekend (10/12/19). I have naturally long nails and I like them shaped oval. The woman I had has straight up magic. Its been 4 days and not a chip on my nails (not gel or acrylic). And she shaped them perfectly! Also - the pricing is amazing! Only sad thing -- I am from Baltimore and can't go here regularly. Take advantage of your proximity and get your nails done here! <3</text>

Uptown nails has been our go to destination for nails. My girlfriend goes there every 2-3 weeks and she always says how Katie does an amazing job. I go to get pedicures from time to time and I'm always happy with the results.
They recently remodeled the place and it looks super nice. Definitely worth checking out</text>

These ladies know how to take care of problem toenails!  Guys, make an appointment and prepare to be surprised in a good way by how much better your feet will look and feel.  I'm a regular customer of uptown Nails and was reluctantly dragged into regular toenail care 15 years ago by my wife.  Best personal grooming decision ever!< /Text>

Great service and friendly staff! I visited San Diego for the weekend and got a Gel Mani & Pedi, my teenage daughter got a set of acrylic nails and a mani pedi for my niece. All of the nail technicians were really nice!  That means a lot to me as a customer because I have experienced nail salons where you feel so unwelcome and unappreciated. My gel manicure was amazing, the hand massage was so relaxing. I needed my acrylics taken off and you can’t even tell because the nail tech was so detailed in the filing and shaping of my nails. All of our hands and feet turned out so pretty. I would come again and recommend to anyone in the San Diego area.</Review>

I’m sure some nail technicians are better than others but the one working on my hands put a big gel bubble on one of my nails that is bulging out and when I told her about it she didn’t fix it. I also got a sport pedicure where she is supposed to rub off your calluses. She did that for like 2 seconds, and that was it. I felt rushed and they didn’t do their best.</Review>

What a wonderful experience! I called ahead to ask if they could get me in for a same-day pedi/mani, and they got me in with no problem! I'm not someone who gets my nails done very often but all the ladies made me feel very welcome and the experience was divine! My nails look great and the girl doing my feet when above and beyond to make sure my toes were dry and even helped me get my shoes back on! Will definitely come back soon!</review>

Jen is the best nail person I have ever had. She is a perfectionist. I’ve been doing my nails for over 40 years! So I should know. She takes her time to get it done right but doesn’t take too long. It’s a friendly welcoming place in a good location. When she’s been out the other people did fine too. No problem. They give you a ticket to park nearby so that is an a problem. It’s a great experience.I get pink and white powder because I don’t my nails don’t like gel and it’s the best job I’ve ever had. They arepink and white not pink and gray for once! 👍😊< /text>

Although this was the first time I ever went to a salon for a mani/pedi I was looking at my toes and felt that she wasnt very skilled and could have done better..... also she kept sighing like she was exhausted from working on my feet and it was obviously over dramatized so I would tip her good.....I feel there are better nail salons. It was fairly cheap so.......ya know......👣</text>

I needed a manicure and pedicure and I figured I would try a gel manicure and pedicure. My wedding is in a few days and now I have to go somewhere else and pay to take off the gel an redo it... the way it looks is totally unacceptable... when I mentioned it to the nail tech... she had no comment other than $65. I normally do not get any polish when I visit uptown nails so I had no clue my nails would turn out so tacky... think twice if you are getting a gel manicure/ pedicure from this place. Check out my photos. Waste of time and waste of money.</Text>

This was THE WORST nail salon experience I've ever had! Wish I could actually rate them with 0 stars. The salon was not very busy when I arrived and I was able to be seated immediately. I proceeded to choose a polish color from the wall and sit down. I was almost instantly bombarded with the questions about "gel" color instead of polish. I don't see the need to pay $15 EXTRA for "gel" color, as I typically never have chipped polish... and IF I do, being a licensed cosmetologist, I can fix them myself. She kept insisting that I NEEDED "gel". Besides the point. A different tech came over and assisted in selecting a "gel" color as close to the polish color I chose as she could find. I selected a completely different color from the "gel" colors I was shown. The tech proceeded to file and buff my nails and she asked again if I wanted "gel".  I said "let's see what my nails look like after you clean them up, I may just leave them clear". She IMMEDIATELY became very nasty and aggressive. Snatching and pushing my fingers as she moved along. 2 other customers walked in, and she proceeded to rush through the rest of my service. Almost as if she was annoyed that I came in to begin with. She asked again "so clear, or polish?" Suddenly, the same "gel" she insisted I needed wasn't an option, as she was trying to hurry me out to help the next customers that came in. I said "don't worry about it!" She quickly slathered some clear polish on my nails and said "thank you" although her a tone indicated more of "please get out of here, you're wasting my time". I paid exactly what she quoted me, $20 and left.

Here's the issue with a lot of these establishments... people of color are second rate customers. I can't possibly want to have the same level of service as other people, therefore I must never tip. Well, you assumed wrong, as THIS is the first time I've ever received a service and not left a tip. If I'm not good enough for your service, then surely, I'd prefer to take my money elsewhere.

You've got to do better, ladies. You don't treat paying customers like trash. Have a great day!< /text>

Came here on out of town visit for a fill and pedi.. prices are reasonable,  can be expensive depending where your coming from and those prices but customer servicewas good, very polite and they did good job pretty fast... nails and feet at the same time.. was kinda sour because one of my nails broke hours later😒

Didn't have time to back but Willing to bet they would've fixed with no issues..</Text>

Worst manicure ive ever had. Pedicure was okay. Nails came out thick and not much of the dead skin was removed as well as the cuticles. Everyone seemed to be in a rush and just wanted everyone in and out. Id never go back.</Review>

I decided to go get a manicure and pedicure since I had about 9 hours to kill at the San Diego airport, I found this salon on google search and I liked their reviews, so I took a taxi to the nail salon and I must say this is and was the absolute best manicure and pedicure I’ve ever had in my life, if you are ever in San Diego near the airport please check them out you won’t be disappointed!!!< /text>

<text>I've been looking for a nail salon that can do nail art and this will be my go to place from now on. Julie did an awesome job on my manicure. I showed Julie a picture of what I wanted and she did exactly that. I recommend the luxury mani/pedi especially if you like massages and foot treatments like paraffin wax. Tina and Julie rubbed my hands and feet for what felt like hours. Definitely check this place out!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I called and asked for the price to have an acrylic overlay SOAKED off and redone, the lady said $28 + $5 for the removal of the overlay. Asked when I could come in, she responded by saying I could come in right away. I arrive, say Hi I just called about having my acrylic soaked off, they yell for a lady from the back. She comes up and saids, hi you just call right? I say yes about haven my nails soaked off. She told me where to sit, and got out a kit with fake tips. I explained to her these we're my real nails, and I didn't need that, I only needed the hardening soaked off so that I could keep my real nail & overlay put back on, she responded and said I know I know. I turned to observe the display of polishes on the wall and POP, she had taken a false nail and slid it between my real nail & the overlay. I said mam, I asked for them to be soaked off and she said yeah but most customer don't like that. I said but that's what I ASKED for. In short it was a very painful experience, I paid her for the removal even though I did not allow her to do my left hand( because that what was asked of me.) She broke all of my nails with the exception on one and none of the nail techs seemed to care at all.<//Review>

This place was on point! They have great serves. I went in for a medi and pedi and came out with the most beautiful blue gel with cute designs on them and matching flowers. I loved it but they forgot to give me the massage part which was a bummer. Hopefully next time will be better.< /Text>

Truly a fun experience. Atmosphere is great and Thursday night is family night with great specials. The servers are amazing and were accommodating to our large group. I strongly recommend the Planning Mill for great pizza and great drinks. Highly recommend, worth to try <3</text>

We found this place on Yelp and it is such a cool building. The atmosphere is great but $35 for a 16" pizza is crazy, in my opinion. We ordered a medium pizza, small salad, a sandwich, and 2 drinks for $53. My husband loved his sandwich, Meatball Grinder, but the balsamic dressing for my Strawberry with Feta Salad was so potent that I asked for a different dressing which I was told it would cost extra. That was a bummer that they charge to replace the crummy dressing that came with it.  I really liked the crispy onions on the pizza but the smoked flavor was overwhelming, 1 piece was more than enough for me. I loved the building and ambience more than the food so I probably won't be back but who knows.<//text>

<review>I was so happy to try the Three Little Pigs.  I ordered it in medium and the pie comes with pulled pork, two kinds of beacon, red pepper, BBQ sauce and topped with onion strings.  I loved the pizza so much.  It is not a typical pie and I'm sure the rest of their pies on the menu are also amazing. Recommend< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<rate>4< /rate><review>To be honest, their pizza is great... Maybe my experience is my fault for ordering outside of the "specialty" this establishment is known for, but so far, they are 0 for 3 on items that are not pizza.  I have ordered the red pulled pork sandwich (overcooked caramelized pulled pork) and yard bird (dry with no real flavor) sandwiches, as well as their garlic parmesan wings (soggy and floating in grease).  I do think the atmosphere is awesome, their building is super cool, and their staff have always been fantastic and friendly (which to be honest is a better combination than you'd find at most places), and is the only reason I rate them as high as I did<//review>< pics>

There ordering system for sit down dining was a first for the wife and myself. I may be old fashioned but having to input my credit card information into a link that I'm not familiar with before even ordering isn't going to happen. And no one working there would stop by to help us understand the process. Luckily Stacked was just a couple of blocks away and there u actually talk to someone to take your order.<//text>

<Review>Pizza is good, every since the covid-19 you have to order from your phone while there are servers around you. It is a little annoying, I understand the covid change, but missing the personal touch. Pizza takes a long time to be ready.

I placed an online order on a Friday for a business meeting on Monday at 11:30 am. Got email confirmation.

Monday morning I showed up 15 minutes before my pickup time and the place is locked, closed without any sign to inform they are not open for the day. A produce delivery truck is sitting outside trying to get hold of somebody to complete the delivery. 6 guests walked away while I'm trying the only phone publicly available, getting voice-mail every time. My office is able to get hold of either the owner or a manager who informed they are closed because of a technical issue???? My co-workers and myself scrambled to get lunch for our meeting participants.

I made contact with this business when I got back to office. They only offered to reschedule the order which was pointless as the meeting was happening at the time. I requested to make sure my business card was refunded for online order.

As of today, Tuesday, I have not received a cancelation email, notification or anything regarding neither the cancelation of the order or the refund to my credit card.

Awful way to drop the ball, and I will avoid to patronize this business in the future IF my managers and supervisors give it it as an option to cater ot purchase food from.</Text>

We went to the planing mill today and had the best time! We go often, mostly for the Thai wings. Christian always gives us the best service and he is one of the reasons we always come back. He is so polite and friendly and we just wanted to give him a shout out!</review>

Great experience! I forgot I was in Visalia once I walked up and entered. Food was delicious. Thai and buffalo boneless wings, and three pizzas. I found out who cooked our food; thank you Beto Ceballos, job well done!<//review>

This place is ideal only if you're eating as a couple at the bar. You can't hear anything even across the table so I would not recommend coming here with a large group.

Pizza and beer are better than average. Mozzarella sticks... not so great. My entire order of sticks were just crust without cheese.< /text>

The pizza was excellent! My friend got the God father sandwich. The service is friendly and fast and I had left my phone on the table by mistake and they came running out to give it to me before I even went out the door. I appreciated that very much!</text>

The best food ! Great selection of beers on tap.
The people and service are always perfect . Always greeted with a smile and I always leave with a smile. The best social environment in Visalia. Always feel welcomed. Whether Having dinner with family or a friend or just stopping by to have a beer and watch the game. The Mill is the best . The food never disappoints.</Review>

Giving 3 stars since they moved areas and now the sustenance doesn't taste the equivalent. This used to be the best pizza around the local area. Presently it possesses a flavor like a $5 prepared to go pizza yet at the same time has the costly cost. Anyway I should state the wings are truly great simply disillusioned in the menu changes and how the pizza never again tastes anything like it used to.< /Review>

I went to the Planing Mill today for lunch.  I got there about 1:45pm.  I looked through the menu and wanted to stay but the only other patrons were at the bar.  I change my mind and got a slice togo.  I took it to my car with a soda.  The Pizza was completely dried out.  The crust was hard on the bottom and thick and chewy in the middle.  The tip of the slice was pointing up.  The cheese was hard and completely dried out.  I returned to the Pizzeria and waited at the counter.  The cashier came back from the bar in a few minutes and I told her the Pizza was dried and old.  She went directly to the phone and started dialing.  She never looked at it or acknowledged anything.  I gave her back the Pizza and she said she was contacting her manager.  I decided just to leave.  She knew the pizza was old and dried up when she sold it to me.  Seriously $9.00 ($7.50 plus tip) for a slice that Costco ($1.50) would have thrown out.  More importantly they knew they gave me awful pizza and never apologized.  Don't bother there are plenty of good Pizzerias around don't support rotten service, I'm not the only one who have seen this.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>The best food ! Great selection of beers on tap.
The people and service are always perfect . Always greeted with a smile and I always leave with a smile. The best social environment in Visalia. Always feel welcomed. Whether Having dinner with family or a friend or just stopping by to have a beer and watch the game. The Mill is the best . The food never disappoints.</text>< pics>

<Text>I went to the Planing Mill today for lunch.  I got there about 1:45pm.  I looked through the menu and wanted to stay but the only other patrons were at the bar.  I change my mind and got a slice togo.  I took it to my car with a soda.  The Pizza was completely dried out.  The crust was hard on the bottom and thick and chewy in the middle.  The tip of the slice was pointing up.  The cheese was hard and completely dried out.  I returned to the Pizzeria and waited at the counter.  The cashier came back from the bar in a few minutes and I told her the Pizza was dried and old.  She went directly to the phone and started dialing.  She never looked at it or acknowledged anything.  I gave her back the Pizza and she said she was contacting her manager.  I decided just to leave.  She knew the pizza was old and dried up when she sold it to me.  Seriously $9.00 ($7.50 plus tip) for a slice that Costco ($1.50) would have thrown out.  More importantly they knew they gave me awful pizza and never apologized.  Don't bother there are plenty of good Pizzerias around don't support rotten service, I'm not the only one who have seen this.</Text>< userid>

This pizza is so dang good! They also have really great sides. You can’t go wrong with any of them. The only downside is that it is pricey but I don’t mind supporting local business that is also just really delicious.<//Review>

Don’t know why people at complaining about. I’ve lived in Visalia and never tried this place. The pizza was excellent and the staff are very friendly. The wings are great as well. I enjoyed that the pizza was crisp and that the toppings don’t just fall off of the pizza slices. The were quick and prompt. Will be returning with my daughter hopefully soon. Thank you for the glove of ice for my daughters hand after she pinched her knuckle with the rest room door. The atmosphere outside would be nice for a visit during the late night hours.<//Text>

< review>
Went there to try this place as we had heard it was good. Asked to be seated for 2. She said it's going to be 30 or 40 minutes for that. This was at 5:45 PM. Open tables visible, one family waiting to be seated. I told the smug hostess that we will go elsewhere. Didn't need to try the food to know we would never be back.<//review>

Clean place with good food. You seat yourself and order at the counter when you're ready to order. Lots of seating if you're thinking of bringing a lot of people and a wheelchair could fit at the end of the table if need be. They have highchairs for babies too. They have a small bar in one corner but it's a healthy atmosphere and a good place for families. The staff was polite.</review>

h... Price is way high for what you get. Pizza flavor is nothing to write home but the sauce is ok with a little spice. Crust is doughy which is good. The toppings were not high quality as the pepperoni was very thin and the onions were cut thin as well. We got the Thursday night special for $29.99 including a large 3 topping pizza and an appetizer. But with that special you can only get certain appetizers. I don’t like to be nickel and dimed. Either it’s a special or it isn’t. In the end, the special saved me $1.01... not really a special. Oh well. Probably won’t come back. Hostess was pleasant and server was great. The pizza was a $10 pizza and the appetizers were good but for $8, it wasn’t worth it.< /Review>

<review>First time going to the new location and it was extremely nice. Hard to find at first especially when you are driving. But now I know where to go. Love the outdoor area. Very clean family friendly atmosphere. Bathrooms were clean and well stocked good thing because the place got super busy around 5ish. Even with them being busy, our waitress was amazing. The pizza turned out just as great as I remember them being. We ordered a large Thai Pie... One of the best ones on the menu. Beer selection was good and came out nice a cold. Will definitely be going back if I end up on that side of town again.</review>< Pictures>

Horrible service. We were told it would be 45 minute wait to be seated. So we said we would wait in the bar and order an appetizer. The hostess stated “you can’t have your name on waiting list and order an appetizer. I will have to remove you from the list”. Either this is a really bad policy or just a really bad hostess. We were just hungry and after all it is a restaurant. We left but had great appetizer and meal in Exeter.< /text>

tried to make reservations for a large group well in advance only to be told they don’t take reservations. They were rude and extremely unhelpful. This is the third time I have have poor service at the Planing Mill. I have gone back because because I think it’s important to give businesses a second chance. But we have been going to this place loyalty since they opened and I guess I expected a little better out of them.

It will be a long time Before I try Planing Mill again. Also, maybe they should rethink their no reservations policy. Clearly they don’t need our business!

The business manger was less than helpful saying they, as staff, have no control over the owners policies. I totally get that!!!! But they don’t have to be rude and provide poor service.

Perhaps the owners should take. Little
More interest in what is happening at their business and consider reevaluating their “no reservations” policy!

We have been faithful customers who have enjoyed Planing Mill since it first opened at its old location. It seems they have gotten a little too big for their britches!<//Text>

Went here with a group of 10. The hostess was nice and friendly. We didn't have much if a wait but it was a Wednesday evening and there were graduation groups eating there at the time.
SERVICE: The service was pretty good. She took our drink orders right away and we got the drinks quickly. My complaint here is that the server didn't come back after we got our drinks to ask about refills on our beers or sodas.
FOOD: The food was great too. I made a custom pizza and about half of our table got personal pizzas while the rest got a salad or sandwich. No complaints from the others in my group about their food. I tried a few of the other items that my family had. The meatball sandwich was good but lacked the flavor to make it great. The 3 pig pizza with onion straws on it was just too much stuff on one pizza and was difficult to eat. Flavor wise it was pretty good though.
One of my other complaints is the open layout coupled with the concrete floor makes it very loud and hard to hear people across the table. I'd go back though and try some of the other dishes on the menu. Maybe try to go back when it's not as busy though or at on of the outdoor tables.</Text>

Our original waiter was extrememly wonderful and provided awesome service. The pizza was better than expected and I felt I got what I payed for. We received a new waitress because the original had to go on break. When it came to paying, she forced my card into paying her a tip. My price that I was given was $48. Once I signed and everything on the tablet, she quickly took it in hopes I wouldn't see she charged me more (I assume). We broke a $20 bill before to give a tip, but didn't since she tried to be sneaky. This was my first time coming here, so I'll give this place a second thought when it comes to eating somewhere. Other than that, it was great.

Edit: I don't know who the waitress was other than she had short hair and wore a red shirt and hat. There was NO confusion on the paying option. She never gave me the option to give a tip. She went through the tablet and handed it to me to sign my name and input my email. That was it. I don't know how to respond to the owner's, so I'm editing this, hoping they see. This occurred tonight 11/3/18.< /Text>

<text>I had a lot of good times at this place. It was my hub for socializing in a town I was not familiar with.

The beer selection is great. Always rotating. Expect something different with each visit. And the prices are fair. Especially during happy hour!

The food is top notch in the area. It ain't just good artisan pizza.. they've got delicious sandwiches, salads, wings, etc.

The staff is also very nice and hospitable.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Did not like their new grab a menu, seat yourself and order at the bar. I'm surprised they don't make you prepare your own food too. No one greeted/welcomed you.  Actually was ignored the entire time I was standing at their counter. My party left and we will not be returning.< /Review>

I highly recommend the Planing Mill.  A favorite destination for us.  Superb hand crafted artisan pizza, friendly staff, and craft beers on tap< /Review>

Really like/love this place...if I could give it 4.5 I would. The staff is nice, the atmosphere is fun, the drinks/taps are local and tasty, and the food is good. Pizza crust is okay IMO, and a couple apps are good, but not exceptional. Overall I love just hanging out here with friends, or using the LARGE side room for meetings. (It is loud in there for parties due to the concrete floors though.)<//text>

<text>The issue as noted in my wife's complaint is not who made a mistake, you or us. In fact, your response to my wife's concern is simply further proof that your company employees would benefit from further training in customer service. We live in a small community where business reputation and customer loyalty should be your #1 priority. We've ordered pizza from you 3-4 times in the last 2 months and we both know your pizza is marked up probably 300% on the cost of ingredients. We don't even get cheese on our pizza and it costs $34.49. We understand you have employees and bills to pay and that's why we were choosing to patronize your local restaurant. But in this event of either an honest mistake or a computer glitch... you still make us pay the full price of a pizza we ended up donating to the homeless folks at Oval Park. Well then yes, we are dissatisfied customers who get to leave a review. We plan to be in this community for the next 30 years and had this issue been resolved differently, you could have had our business. I honestly can't believe you replied to her review by saying it was her fault... do you realize how many possible other variables could have gone wrong between her order and your fulfillment of that order? Your mission is "To deliver an exceptional guest experience... with a focus on genuine guest service." Well, you failed last night. Best wishes to the owners of your restaurant in their future endeavors. They've lost out on what could have been long-term valued customers and a lot of customer referrals.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Pizza here is top notch, they have some weird toppings that put me off at first, for example the Thai Pie but I'm glad i tried it. It's pretty good, all there pizza is. It has great ambience and is very relaxing. 8/10< /Text>

<Review>The Manager turned away a huge group on Tuesday 3/10. Their loss. Refused to make a giant pizza for a kids party. Had called and was told all we needed to do is call 1 hr before to order.

Went on a Saturday afternoon during the Pliny the Younger release. A very welcoming, spacious place to hang with friends over some beers or with the family hanging outdoors with games to play. The owner, Tim, is always gracious and his staff are very nice. I ordered a medium Evil Pie pizza. It consisted of chorizo, linguica, pepperoni, garlic, pepperoncini, peppers, ricotta, serrano peppers, green onion and cholula sauce. Very delicious. Overall, I highly recommend coming here.< /text>

Giving 3 stars because they moved locations and now the food doesn’t taste the same. This used to be the best pizza in town. Now it tastes like a $5 ready to go pizza but still has the expensive price. However I must say the wings are pretty good just disappointed in the menu changes and how the pizza no longer tastes anything like it used to.< /Text>

<Text>The worst service.  Called it in to pick up and when I got there to pick up they did not have record of it and had to order there and wait another 25 minutes.  Got a basic house salad and mushrooms and it was 22.00 which I think they overcharged me and then I did not get dressing for my salad.  Never going back.  Terrible place< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
If I could give less than 1 star I would. I am incredibly disappointed with the service I received from your employees. I was planning on hosting an event at your establishment, and called to reserve a day. I was told over the phone by your party reservation manager that I could reserve the time, but a payment would be required at least 2 weeks before the party day so we reserved the time. I then sent out invitations with the time and location of Planing Mill. I came in 2 weeks and 3 days before the party to pay for the reservation, and then was told that my reservation didn’t exists and the time I was told was reserved for my party, was no longer available. The party reservation employee then said that the party reservations are first come first serve, and a payment is required to reserve the room. This is completely different than what the previous employee had told me, and now I’m left without a venue for my party just 2 weeks before. Your employees shuffled me from employee to employee, and disregarded my concern and the fact that I was told my reservation was made, when it was not. The unorganized and undedicated conduct of your employees is rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional. This is extremely disappointing and I would greatly appreciate this issue resolved.<//Review>
<resp>{'time': 1542516257850, 'text': 'Hi Alexandria,\n\nWe would first like to sincerely apologize for your frustrations. Our reservation policy is always the same. Reservations are made on a first come, first served basis. We never hold a reservation date without payment and our contract signed first. Reservations must be made and paid for at least two weeks prior to the date for staffing and scheduling reasons but can always be made anytime before that, as we recommend coming in to do so as soon as possible. We do have a later time slot available on the date you requested. Please email us at contact@planingmillpizza.com to speak to our head manager.'}</resp>< UserId.>

Decent pizza (we shared a medium Thai pie) - it's not Neapolitan style but not to thick either. Wide range of beers on draft - it was fun to have one from Fort Collins Street many years.</review>

LOVE THIS PLACE! <3 Their food is top quality and always cooked well. They have a nice variety and some fun options besides...normal boring pepperoni pizza. These are the restaurants making our town a better place. Try the Artichoke  Fritters and the Kitchen Sink Pizza...can't go wrong! =)< /text>

<review>Very first time here, my boyfriend brought me here as a date and it was actually fun and cool. We ordered and sat down and was waiting for our food. The only bad thing about this place was the wait time. We had to wait 23 minutes but maybe that's because they were busy and about to close.</review><username>Nancy Peters<//username></record></dataset><record>

Great pizza. But as I sit in this nice new restaurant I can’t help but say “Please God get more seating”. You waste so much room with the giant round tables, and sit a family of 4 there, only to have an hour and a half wait on a Thursday.

Five stars if I can eat here without having to wait so long. Third visit in a row with this long a wait. Please do something with the seating arrangement.  I’m sitting here watching people turn around and leave after they hear the wait time. You’re losing money.<//review>

<review>Planing Mill has the best pizza in town hands down. High quality cheese, great sauce, perfect crust, and good toppings really come together with this pizza. The wing are also superb, especially the Thai wings whose sticky, spicy, and sweet flavors combine to a flavor explosion.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>A completely different pizza place. The enterance was amazing and thought it was a restaurant. Inside it's nicely decorated but too dark. I think there needs to be more booths. The pizza was okay, I would have to try again to make sure. I'd give it a 7/10 cause the pizza was greezy. maybe a 8/10 when I try again.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Seems like this place is geared towards a beer crowd who don’t mind how their food comes out. Salad was fresh and dressing was good. Unfortunately pizza was a disappointment. The margarita pizza had thick crust and was flavorless. Pepperoni Pizza was the same, flavorless 😢. Our server kept putting his back to my husband while he was helping the other guess at the next table. It’s kind of hard to eat when someone keeps putting their rear in your face when they have an option to stand to the side and excuse themselves while they are at it. Management really needs to have a staff meeting to enforce sanitary precautions. The cooks have beards without beard guards and we noticed cooks were touching their face while cooking. A plus is they have corn hole on the front patio.< /Text>

Because this is hand done pizza, expect to spend some time here and bring something to entertain small ones while you enjoy a craft beer before hand. Be aware of busy nights (Friday, Saturday, Game Day) and make plans accordingly. The pizza is great. The staff WILL remember you if you are/become a regular and they do great beer nights.

It was my first time going here and it was great. The scenery is amazing. You could take alot of good pictures. The pizza is amazing. A cool thing about that place is they have a variety of pizza toppings. They have a contest with eight people who finish a huge pizza. If you win you don't have to pay for it.< /Review>

<Date>1499660674679<//Date><review>I read the reviews and expected good pizza. However, I was really surprised at how mediocre the pizza really was. Not a Little Cesar quality mind you but not much better. What it really lacked in was any flavor. The dough was lacking in flavor and the sauce was lacking in flavor. I asked to have the creamy Alfredo mixed with the pesto to give it more flavor but was told they could not do that. Considering I spent just under $100 for three pizzas, I don't expect to ever go back again.<//review><username>Owen Fish< /username><resp>None</resp><Rate>1<//Rate>< Pics>

My family members are regulars here. We typically come once every 1-2 weeks for carry out and occasionally dinning in. The pizza can be a bit pricey, but we typically come for the special which makes price about the same as most pizza places. The Planing Mill has way better quality ingredients. Stellar Pizza. Tip: On a nice day it's fun to sit outside and play corn hole.<//Review>

<text>My family members are regulars here. We typically come once every 1-2 weeks for carry out and occasionally dinning in. The pizza can be a bit pricey, but we typically come for the special which makes price about the same as most pizza places. The Planing Mill has way better quality ingredients. Stellar Pizza. Tip: On a nice day it's fun to sit outside and play corn hole.<//text><rating>5<//rating>< Response>

The Planing Mill is a great place to get some good food and cold brews. Great selection of craft beer to pair with the delicious pizzas and sandwiches. The atmosphere and decor is really awesome. Hang with your friends on the patio outside and play corn hole.< /review>

I love this place! Their pizza is some of the best I've had outside of NY and the toppings combinations are pretty great. Their various appetizers are also quite good (I recommend the wings and drunken mushrooms). In addition to all the great food they serve, they also have a pretty nice, albeit a little small, craft beer bar. With up to a dozen beers that rotate out every few days, there's always something new to try. If you're in the Visalia area and looking for something to eat, you can't go wrong stopping by here.< /Text>

Was fine, nice enough place, service and pizza good, but given that I've had people wax eloquent about it, meh. Maybe to drink beer on a weekend or something, but there are plenty of places to find good beer now. For pizza, the joint we all know at Main and Church is the STUFF. With a large group I might pick TPM first, but a dozen people on the porch at PK is no problem. Good, but I don't know when I'll go back.<//text>

We brought our Spanish exchange daughter and her family that was visiting and all had a great time. Great food selection, great beer selection, and great service. The new location is great!!! From wings, pizza, to the kicked up Rueben sandwich! We can never get enough. Excited to try the new items on the menu. Highly recommend three little pigs pizza, kicked up Rueben sandwich, and the Cubano.</text>

<date>1500390630676</date><Rate>2< /Rate><Text>We read the reviews, and were enthusiastic about trying out The Planing Mill.  The reality didn't meet the hype.  I've waited a couple months to post this review: I think it's better to praise than scold, and restaurants are kind of subjective.  That said, the service was inattentive, slow, and confusing.  There is a bathroom, but it is located outside the building, and was a mess.  We were told Internet access was only for the staff.  Altogether, we couldn't wait to get on our way, and so, when our meals came, we were in no mood to enjoy them.  My wife asked about getting the remainder of her meal wrapped, and our waitress showed so little enthusiasm that we just got up and left.  I hope your experience is better.<//Text>< pics>

The pizza did not stand out as very incredible. The topping were sparse. The taste was bland. It was cooked perfectly.
The bar has an excellent section of craft beer. The service is lacking. No one checked on our party while I was there but once to ask if we wanted a to go box.</Text>

Order prepared incorrectly. Pizza's brought to the table 20mins apart. Manager was rude and lied to cover up the cooks mistake. No offer from the manager to correct the many mistakes. They refused to have the owner contact us. Eaten here several time but never again...</Review>

The pizza did not stand out as very incredible. The topping were sparse. The taste was bland. It was cooked perfectly.
The bar has an excellent section of craft beer. The service is lacking. No one checked on our party while I was there but once to ask if we wanted a to go box.<//Review>

Our Manager on duty tonight did explain to your husband that unfortunately, because the order you placed and received from GrubHub was not an error made on our part, but was an error acknowledged on your behalf, we would not be able to provide an additional order free of charge. We did however, attempt to extend an offer for a discount should you want to order again. We apologize if this fell short of your expectations.'}</Resp>< review>
Rudest people I've met in my life. They screw up my order, make me pay full price & wont do anything to rectify. RUN!

Response to Planing Mill: I'm so glad that you all finally found your manners. I'm disappointed it required a public forum in order for you to conjure some up. The Grubhub guy put your employee on speaker phone so I heard for myself just how RUDE she was. Your lack of customer loyalty (& manners) for a pizza you no doubt mark up 300% is jarring. You'd rather lose my business entirely (& yes I will relay my experience to everyone I know in Visalia) than fix the issue.<//review>

Great little pizza spot! I don't visit Visalia very often, but I'll definitely be back. It's tucked in a random little spot. Super rustic and fun. They have an outdoor patio. When I was there, they had a bunch of Mead on tap. My wife loved it. I had an Imperial IPA from Tulare (don't remember the company,  unfortunately) - just wanted to try it... but it was really good!! This place has standards. Everyone in my party had pizza and really liked it. Service was fast and friendly. Only minor complaint would be that they only serve beer and wine... My wife just happened to want a cocktail. She was happy with the mead though! The price was really good, too!</Text>

Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. You cannot go wrong with "The Three Little Pigs". We stayed in Three Rivers while visiting Sequoia National Park. Well worth the drive to Visalia for this place.< /text>

<text>My recent visit on Wednesday, November 10 will be my last. Unhappy with the treatment by your staff. I am a part of your loyalty program and wished to use my coupon towards my purchases. However, I was rudely denied this opportunity by your Manager (Alex? The lady that works the bar) after other staff had approved my usage. I was not informed that I was unable to use this prior to my ordering the daily special and instead of accommodating the Manager basically told me tough luck there is nothing I can do and then wanted to reprimand my server right in front of me, how embarrassing! How about a little better communication upon your staff and and an apologetic response.  Don't think I will be back.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< time>

<Text>I went this afternoon with some friends.  I have been to the Planing Mill before and have always had wonderful food, and no issues with service before today.  My friends and I each ordered personal pizzas and drinks.  I ordered the Muscles from Brussels, with no bacon.  I had been planning on ordering this pizza since we decided where we would be having lunch.  It sounded awesome, and I have heard that Mike's Hot Honey is amazing. Unfortunately, when my pizza arrived, I was told that they were out of the honey.  I was visibly disappointed and told our server that the only reason I ordered that pizza was because of the honey.  She was incredibly polite and apologized, and I appreciate that, but I wish that I had been told before hand that they were out of the honey.  I 100% would have ordered a different pizza.  That particular pizza has only 6 toppings and now I'm down 2.  The server offered to bring me a different sauce on the side, but I wasn't sure what to order.  She suggested the aioli that is typically paired with the appetizers.  I don't know that that was the right choice.  As I said, the server was very sweet, and very apologetic, my issue is that I felt like I was being offered a substutution for an ingredient, but there was no offer to "make it right" or make sure I was satisfied with what I got.  Other establishments would have offered a replacement, or perhaps a discount on my next visit, something....  But that was not the case.  Additionally, when we went to the bar, we were interested in trying the Mexican lager that was on the $2 Taco Tuesday special, but the bartender wasn't happy with the way it was pouring, so we were offered a different beer, at the same price.  The second beer wasn't as good, but for $2 it was a decent replacement.  This was the offer to make it right that I had hoped for with the pizza.  I will definitely be back, but I will be sure to ask if all the ingredients are available before I order my pizza.<//Text><Rating>3< /Rating></record>

We were told it would be 45 min and after an hour and twenty min they said they had seating but were behind in the kitchen. Wth.  Don't go with kids bc if you are on the waiting list they won't even allow you to order French fries while you wait the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get a table.  We ordered 6 drinks and still wouldn't let us order apps!  Won't be going back!</review>

Don't know how it is, after checking their website to make sure it was open on a Sunday afternoon, we drove from Lemoore, 29 miles, to take my granddaughter out to pizza to celebrate her birthday along with 20 other family and friends. When we get there, we're informed they are closed for a private party.
Very unprofessional, should have posted that on their website. 10-15 other people were turned away also in the 5 minutes we were there. Staff didn't seem to really care.<//Text>

<text>Parking at the new location is terrible. Food has become mediocre. It seems as time has passed, so has their desire to bring the quality ingredients they used to offer. And though the food taste cheaper, the prices have remained the same. I still come back from time to time hoping they'll once again go back to making pizza they way they did a few years back.<//text><username>Bobby Sierra<//username><gmap_id>0x80952f7a594ffb55:0x3e88a089ccbf3b5a<//gmap_id><time>1509049718940</time>< rating>

<time>1466076757788< /time><Rating>3< /Rating><Text>Tasty pizza but the service wasnt so hot. We ordered two medium pizzas for two adults and three kids. When the kids pizzas came out we assumed the next one would be right out. However, it didn't and when we asked for the status of the second pizza the server sounded surprised we needed another pizza. Once the mistake was noticed, I would've assumed the second pizza would've been put on a fast track but the second pizza took even longer than the first. Both were really good but I preferred the simpler cheese and pepperoni and the flavorful sauce really shined.

This is my experience.  Loooooonnnnnng wait for food during a non-busy time.  Sandwich was toasted too much and burnt. Cold fries.  Waitress didn’t seem apologetic.<//review>

Good quality ingredients with friendly service makes this a cool place to go when downtown. Though they make a good pizza, the price is a little high and the crust is different than convention pizzas.<//text>

<Text>Good food but things keep changing. Went the week of Valentine's day and was told you could call ahead to get on the list for a table (couldn't before), and went again last week (a few weeks later) and that wasn't the case anymore. Beer selection varies and they don't always have what they advertise.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Not very many beers to choose from but as for the food...! Omg, I recommend the Muscles from Brussels! Spicy, crispy, yummy! For apps we got bruchetta, delicious, yet hard to make bad, and Thai boneless chicken wings (1/2 off all Boneless Wings on Mondays...$6 😍 for a lb!). We split a Greek Salad, so good, then ordered 2 $5 Brussel Sprout apps to snack on while we finished our beers! Make sure to shake some parm on those brussles...very generously may I say! Gave 4 stars cuz of the small  beer selection or I would have given 5 stars all day! Love the new building!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80952f7a594ffb55:0x3e88a089ccbf3b5a< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Its loud inside, but outside seating is nice permitting weather. The staff was friendly, amd service was good. Wait time wasnt bad. The pizza is interesting, fresh, and diverse. The only bad thing I can say is my wifes drink was forgotten, but corrected quickly.</text>

<Review>Good, solid Mexican food.

Ordered the carnitas burrito & my wife had the veggie burrito.   Both came out quick and fresh.   Chips and salsa are fresh and tasty.

Carnitas is the perfect juicy, savory, texture and flavor, well shredded.  Every bite has a good blend of everything.

Really good place, especially if you aren't into Chipotle.  MUCH more authentic.< /Review><Response>None< /Response></record>

Haven't been here since before they moved. The new place is much bigger with a great atmosphere. The food is a little pricey, but more than worth it. I'll definitely be back.<//Text>

Our Manager on duty tonight did explain to your husband that unfortunately, because the order you placed and received from GrubHub was not an error made on our part, but was an error acknowledged on your behalf, we would not be able to provide an additional order free of charge. We did however, attempt to extend an offer for a discount should you want to order again. We apologize if this fell short of your expectations.'}<//Response>

<Time>1562593498274</Time><Resp>None< /Resp><Text>(Translated by Google) You can eat American style pizza. The feature is that the pizza dough has a firm volume. It is recommended to go with a large number of people and share various kinds of pizzas.
You can put the pizza you didn't eat out in a box and take it home.
There are many types of beer.
There is also a drink bar, so even people who can not drink alcohol can enjoy it.
There is no parking lot at the store, so basically we recommend that you park on the street around the store or use Uber or a taxi.

(Original)
アメリカンスタイルのピザが食べられます。ピザ生地がしっかりとボリュームがあるのが特徴です。大人数で行っていろいろな種類のピザをシェアするのがオススメです。
食べきれなかったピザは箱に入れて持ち帰ることが出来ます。
ビールの種類も充実しています。
ドリンクバーもあるので、アルコールが飲めない人でも楽しむことが出来ます。
店の駐車場は無いので、基本は店の周辺の道路に路上駐車をするか、Uberやタクシーを使うことをオススメします。</Text></record></dataset><record>
