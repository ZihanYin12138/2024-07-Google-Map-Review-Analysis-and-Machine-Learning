Best sandos, great prices... the price is right! Their pizza is some of the best. No lie.!
The help there is truly helpful. Get the Chicken Combo with white sauce. My favorite!!!!< /Review>

<username>Ericka Gilliland</username><Text>Fattes has SUCH GOOD PIZZA!! You can't beat the buy one get one free deal they constantly have. I HIGHLY recommend the white chicken pizza. It is SO delicious. The workers are pretty friendly, they missed one of our pizzas, but gave us soda to make it right which was very nice of them. Grab some pizza before hitting the beach. It is a central coast/college staple.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA9YJRiSxP_0ygw8MbwE6jW6wJa4OOGzfnF8b_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgJi_40LRMVlngA-YD-dHNl5yOs3bOQBbbz62P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPe_TwAsvsZBy_UGqzwdj_9GFDPnw1lLEnbZvmN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><GmapID>0x80ecf1185e0947d5:0x345dc557b8e0dc8c</GmapID><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

<Text>I found their pies to be phenomenal (I got 2 veggie pizzas) fresh ingredients and a perfectly risen dough. Plus cant be beat for the price! I unfortunately had an issue with one of the two pies however they were kind enough to give me a full refund (after me denying twice that they make me another pizza.) Overall 9/10 would reccomend! The customer service could be a bit better but again they did the right thing which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars.

<text>Foods just alright, staff gets flustered and frustrated when it gets busy and it shows.

Ordered for pick up and drove all the way home and the order was wrong. Called in and they said they would remake it. When they remade it, it was still wrong.

<Review>Very fast and affordable. I like their garlic chicken pizza as well as all the standards. I was pleasantly surprised that when calling in on a Friday night it was ready in half an hour (delivery was a lot longer though so call early if you need it delivered).

Always a decent pizza for what you spend. The 2 for 1 has been a local favorite for years. Keep up the good work and they're monster combo sandwich and pretty much any pizza with white sauce is going to be good.< /Text>

Not the kindest or welcoming staff, they just kind of stare at you when you walk in and don’t say anything. They hardly smile, I just don’t feel comfortable going in here. I try to avoid this one and go to the Grover Fatties where they are more welcoming.</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Pizza is almost below standard quality.. For the price anyone would expect more. Seem to be in over their heads, several orders (for 6 minutes away) took over an hour and a half! On an off day too. When told that our next order would be half off for the wait, the guy on phones (absolutely brain dead fellow) told me to EMAIL THE OWNER TO GET OUR DISCOUNT VERIFIED?! Everyone who has delivered has looked and been stoned and inattentive.. For the few times we get it for the kids, really falls short for pizza, simple enough yet missing mark by a mile. We WON'T BE ordering from them again, which is their loss as its easy money...If you don't care about quality, level of service, or price, then they will work just fine. I'm local and a native and they are a damn shame.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80ecf1185e0947d5:0x345dc557b8e0dc8c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was traveling, we got late to the hotel and found a place to get something to eat, Fatte's was open and close, never eaten there. The pizza was awesome, fresh out of the oven good sauce and fresh ingredients, from outside it look like a dive, but inside there is all the flavor, very recommended.<//review>

<Review>Don't let the name scare you, this may be the best take out pizza in town. Don't waste anymore calories on Papa Johns or Pizza Hut, this is where you want to get your pizza for parties or football night.
I highly recommend the white garlic sauce it can creamy and magical!</Review>< response>

I stopped in recently and ordered a ham and cheese sub.  First of all, it was enormous.  I didn't finish it all, not because I couldn't but because I knew that I shouldn't.  It had generous, quality portions of ham and cheese toasted inside a delicious, crusty, buttery roll.
I wrapped up the last 1/3 and enjoyed it a day later.  The sandwich was inexpensive and the service was friendly.
I'm sold.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I have no idea how this place has such high reviews?? Pizza is terrible. The crust literally tastes like cardboard. If you have leftovers forget about eating them. The crust gets so hard it cuts your mouth! If you want cheap pizza that is actually good, go to Pizza La Nova at Madonna & Los Osos Valley Road. 2 larges for $13.99! The only reason I rate Fatte's two stars is because when the pizza is fresh it is halfway edible, and they are relatively cheap.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

You're paying someone to make you garbage?  Why not plan a family pizza night and actually make a pizza?  It'd take longer, but you'd be guaranteed quality ingredients and you'd actually get to make memories... rather than mindlessly eating in front of the TV?

Great pizza for the price. I like some pizza places better in SLO, but none match the $/(quality*quantity) ratio  of Fatte's.<//Review>

<Time>1495749234661< /Time><Text>Tbh when I saw the outside and how low the price was, I thought it to be low quality and not so good. Well never judge a book by its cover the saying goes, my brother and I loved it sooo much. The sauce was actualy saucy the cheese had a total diffrent taste, the bread was crispy also crunchy.

< Review>
This is a very popular shop to get pizza in SLO, since they offer great deals on their very good pizzas. you wont get anything fancy from them, but thats what they are, they offer solid quality food at very affordable prices. Me and my friends get pizza delivered by them whenever we are in the mood for pizza since you can get 2 large pizzas for $14, which is a great deal for the quality. oh, and one of their most popular pizzas is their delicious chicken and white sauce, that is usually the one that disappears first when everyone gets at the food.

The employees are all very pleasant and they usually deliver in a more than acceptable time frame, so if you are craving pizza and you are in SLO, unless you want to get it at a sit-down restaurant, I would say the best choice is Fattes.</Review>

<review>Waited for two hours. They skipped me twice, and I let it slide. When I finally got to my chair they said someone was ahead of me and made me leave my chair. Just book an appointment you say, and I gladly would! But they charge charge $10 just to do so! That's more than half of what it costs to cut my hair there ($17)!  Please don't cut your hair here if you value your time. It's a bunch of  young guys who give preference to their friends and ignore their walk-in customers to a ludicrous and  shameful degree. Also if you have kids, make sure you're okay with them being exposed to an obscene amount of profanity and racial slurs, because that's what you'll find here.

0/5 stars.

Oh and they don't take cards.</review>< Rate>

Terrible place to go! I’ve been waiting for sixty minutes for a barber and I even signed in to their sign-in sheet. Around three to four people were ahead of me. This place is fueled with nepotism and would rather help out their lesbian customers and thug friends rather than the people who arrived first. Barbers would rather much watch football than pay attention to their customers and were constantly distracted by the game than doing their job. Barbers were cursing worse than a sailor. Definitely not a family friendly place!< /review>

Barely came from this place. There was like 7 in front me which went before me which I was fine with. Then I started observing there were people that got there after me go before me and I got up and ask the guy in charge of the list, why wasn't I being called, when he pulled out the list of names my name wasn't crossed out but like 5 people below my name were and he told me I'll be next. So I waited for the next name to be called and guess what? It wasn't my name so I got up and bounced.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Every barber here is talented. Unlike most barbershops, it they actually want to cut your hair. They're all really cool to just sit down and talk to. Even if you're new, they'll take their time on giving you a haircut until you're completely satisfied.

🙏 I was running trying to get my son in somewhere with my usual barber being sick, and it being after 5pm everywhere we went just stopped taking clients for the day so I went to Google. Thank the heaven's Classic Barbershop popped up.. We didn't even have to sit down. Their fast and I didnt even have to explain a lot. He did my son's hair perfectly.. Great atmosphere with a family feel.. 💙💙💙</review>

Horrible cut.  If you like listening to cursing and nonsense while you wait, if you like having 'friends' of the barbers cut in front of you, then this is your place.<//Review>

I will never go back to this place. It takes them over an hour, with the wrong haircut. People that came in after us, they got to get a cut before us. My kiddos hair was butchered!!I will stick with Tuan( Mr.Lees barbershop on Oak) Tuan just wasn't open today, I will wait for him next time and not come back here again.< /Text>

Outbreak Brewing Company is one of my favorite breweries. The beer here is good and it’s cold. A great atmosphere. Kid friendly too. Good folks that run this place.<//text>

Would give more stars but no one is wearing a mask and they aren't enforcing it. Right now they have Mikey's kilted kitchen making food and no one cooking wearing masks. No bartenders wearing masks either. It's a good way to get shut down<//Text>< Pictures>

Our bartenders do wear masks, but obviously not during your visit.  I'm wondering if it was during the power outage chaos - although no excuse.  We'll talk to our bartenders and our caterers.  We hope we can earn that 5 star review on your next visit."}< /response>

<review>The beer here was decent and if in the area, I'd probably stop back by.  The brewmaster was cool and chatted me up while I was trying their beers, I always appreciate that.  The place is also dog friendly which was cool cause we had our new puppy with us :)  They are doing some experimental stuff there and if that's your jam, I'd say stop by :)<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXi0vvqVtNePv3DGRQ69RLa6XoKx-_L6ScJ5be=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Went into the place  and felt I was in the wrong place right away .. no masks. no distancing ... ordered a beer ... 6 ounces for $$$$7 and did not like it at all. Will Not be back.</Text></record>

I moved to the area of Placerville Ca. and walked into Outbreak Brewery on the day they opened. I have been going there ever since, they just reached their one year anniversary and if you haven't been there yet you are missing out!<//text>

<text>The beer here was decent and if in the area, I'd probably stop back by.  The brewmaster was cool and chatted me up while I was trying their beers, I always appreciate that.  The place is also dog friendly which was cool cause we had our new puppy with us :)  They are doing some experimental stuff there and if that's your jam, I'd say stop by :)</text>< gmapID>

Outbreak Brewing hosted this year's Mountain Vibe Music Festival pre show so of course we had to make the trek out from the Bay Area. They blocked off the parking lot and pulled in a a food truck that had the best burgers I've ever had! I'm not a huge beer fan but was pleasantly surprised to see a cherry beer on the menu! Everyone working the event we're super nice and personable. It was a great night and definitely worth the drive from the Bay! My only regret is not getting a growler of the cherry beer to bring home. Guess we will have to go back!<//Text>

{'time': 1512958807398, 'text': "Hey Mike! Thanks for the review and I am so sorry we did not have something more to your liking. Sounds like the Rye It would be a great beer for you to try and we should be getting that back on tap shortly. We are also looking at doing a Kolsh Ale which might fit the style you're looking for. I hope you give us another chance once we have these style on tap. Cheers."}<//Response>
<username>Mike Duerr<//username><text>Went mostly to see the band that was playing. Nice place, decent crowd. I am not a fan of IPA's, which seem to be all the rage. I like lagers or some ales. The choices were IPA's or porters. The first beer was good. Porter in the 'ville. The second beer was terrible...Porter Patrol. I could barely drink half of it...had a very peppery taste to me...felt nauseous after about 1/2 of it. Sorry that it just wasn't for me. Will probably go back when the band I went to see plays again but hope for a better beer experience.

Love this place, glad we discovered it during Our short time in Hangtown.  Bartenders are very friendly, and the brewer/ owner I met was very down to earth as well.  It's a new place;  and strikes me as an as-yet  undiscovered gem.  It's on the main drag, but on one end / not the middle so it's a great place to begin or end your night in Placerville-  depending on which way you're going/ coming from.  I spent two weeks in California from North to South, and I'm still finding myself thinking about this place.  It'll be the first place I go if I ever find myself in Placerville again. The Jalapeño Porter was the hottest beer I've ever had.  I like the Fermu.< /Text>

<Review>I thought that my charges were going to completely change the course of my life but the H Law Group killed it in court and not only do I not have jail time, but they got the entire case dropped! The money was definitely well spent and I am thankful for their hardwoork! I don't plan on getting in trouble with the law again but if I or a friend does I know who I'll call.</Review>< Gmap_id>

I wanted to write a review of my experience with this company just recently. I had some not super serious criminal law issues and retained the H Law Group for my defense. I must say they were always on time and courteous and I felt they had a good grasp of the facts of my case and evidence available.< /Review>

Con: Poor communication, over promises and then doesn't deliver, no follow up unless you initiate, lack of due diligence with respect to your case. I cannot stress enough how completely lacking their communication is.

Go with Jeff Gold, I used him the first time around. I wish I would have gone back to him instead of going to this firm. You'll find him on Yelp. You'll pay slightly more with him but it's totally worth it.< /Text><Date>1617410374532</Date>< rate>

<review>I was originally charged with a felony DUI but there was no reason as to why these charges were felony instead of misdemeanor. The H Law Group were quick to act and with using all the evidence from the night of my arrest, they were able to get the charges reduced. Very thankful for the team H Law team here!< /review>< pics>

After I spoke with the H Law Group and they explained what they could do to help me I didn't even believe it, but here I am with a reduced charge and giving 5 star review. They deserve 10 stars if it was possible.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I lost hope after receiving my 2nd DUI but after talking to the team at H Law, some was restored. They were very transparent about my situation and did everything they could about it.

When I was charged with domestic violence for a situation I was barley even involved in,  I went to H Law for help and forever will be thankful. They not only got my case thrown out but the outcome of my case led to the justice of the person who was really at fault that terrible night. Hopefully they can help you as well as they did me.</Text>

H Law Group has exceeded my expectations with both their legal representation and customer service throughout my case they have kept in touch with me giving any updates on the status of my case. Very impressed before this incident I didn't know the faintest thing about criminal law or how the courts work.<//Review>

The city was giving me a DUI, my first DUI and I did not even go out of my lane. The H Law Group here was super fast in fixing this problem and took all of the steps off of my shoulders for me. Thankyou</Review>

I spent all day looking for a DUI Lawyer in Los Angeles, and finally decided to give the H Law Group a call.  I"m glad I did , they actually are (and I double checked it) the leading Los Angeles DUI Attorney around. They were able to answer some really tough questions I had regarding my daughters DUI.  They were extremely informative in laying out all the options we had.  Just helpful all around.  So if you get a DUI in LA County, these are the lawyers you want on your side!</review>

Mr hadadi is currently handling a 3rd DUI case for me... In which case I was one beer over the legal limit, did not damage any property, or hurt anybody, a vitimless crime, and frankly drove out of necessity to avoid greater harm to myself....so dont judge me...and I just want to say my dealings with hidadi have been concerning to say the least....it's really sad that I have to type this...and I would never try to stop another man from making his means, and I don't even want to type this because I have better things to do, and an attorney should be doing everything they can for you..... but!! I also care about people, and our Judicial System is clearly taking advantage of them, there's statistical evidence and demographics that shows how racist are judicial system really is and agenda... So far mr. Hadadi has not fulfilled his fiduciary duty to me, is taking advantage of the trust I have in him as my attorney, and frankly maybe involved in malpractice....He will steal $3,000 from you, he will let the judge do whatever he wants with you, and brush your case off to another one of his new hires, that is no better than a public defender.....folks this is just my opinion but I have bachelor's degree in mass comm and was born and raised in Los Angeles, I'm an assistant director and more Ive worked with Kristen Stewart 2 Chainz YG ASAP Rocky and Maggie Lindemann trippie Redd zedd, and many others, and I actually care about the people here. The H Law group is lazy, and does not fulfill common request like if you ask them to file a motion on your behalf, which is never too much to ask, they won't even try to make any type of mitigation package for you, this attorney has failed to provide clear communication with me. This guy will sell all his experience to you and then let some other person, some new person, manage your case....so far he let a person named Holly wave all my constitutional rights and get me a scram bracelet, any good attorney would have never let this happen.. I would doubt if this guy even reads the details of your case or knows anything about it... you should quiz him on them actually, I bet you he won't know any of dets in your case.. I mean the guy hasn't even submitted the video that I recorded at the time that I was stopped into evidence...and the fact that I was cognitive enough to even record a video of the time of the stop proves that I was ok to drive. The way the police drew me out of the car with guns in an extremely aggressive manner was the most concerning part of this entire situation. Sadly the police don't even follow common stop procedures anymore when they pull you over, what is happening to our rights and common  courtesy? we'll see how it goes from here but I can already see myself firing this guy in court....sadly.... do your own research people!!!! On the positive side he does have a great Interactive site for managing your case and accepts payments, the most important thing is getting expungements people (sorry for bad typing I spoke this to my phone...)<//review>

First thing, they do not go to any post conviction hearings. In my case, this means that they should not have gone to any hearings after they plead guilty in my case.
For those who are not familiar with the court process, this would be the status update conferences. I had over 5. This means most people that retain this office will have to go in front of the judge on their own.
In my case, they did attend some of these hearings for me.
I believe they did so only after I was upset because the attorney Nima laughed at me during a conversation and lied to me (I have messaged proof).
I also have to call of work multiple times to attempt to do my booking because of their office’s lies and misinformation to me. They even sent me to a location to attempt to turn myself in that did not have ANY of the equipment to do any bookings. It was a waste of time and caused a lot of issues with my employer.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, I almost signed a booking form to turn myself in that was for a FELONY when I had a misdemeanor. My minimum sentencing would have been longer than what I would have needed under my misdemeanor and I am really glad I read all my papers (unlike their office) because I do not even want to think about what would have happened if I would have signed for the felony charge.
If you want to take your chances still, hope that you get Shayan as your case manager. He was the only helpful person here.< /text>

I had a bogus ticket from 5 years ago. Court placed a hefty warrant out for me, and it got out of hand. I travel a lot for work, so making time to personally take care of it proved difficult. From the moment I called Nima Haddidi and his entire team made me feel very confident and positive. Long story short, they were able to get everything taken care of, and best of all, I never had to fly into town for any court dates. It was money very well spent. I highly recommend them. Great job guys! I really appreciate everything!< /text>

Find yourself a better law firm, I regret my decision to select them. My main complaint among a few, was their failure to hire an expert before the pre- trial hearing. It was my understanding that they would, and they never did. The administrative staff and paralegals seemed to be on top of things but that didn’t make a difference in my case. In the end, I got the same deal I would have got with a free or low cost public defender. I understand the specifics of my case completely, but I don’t think the lawyers did everything they could have done in order for me to get the best results.< /text>

Consulted them regarding my DUI and I was totally impressed with their vast knowledge about the different aspects of DUI as a whole.  I later went into their office for a consultation, that led to me signing up. My case was dropped to a wet reckless. I am so happy that I used their services and made the decision to hire this law firm. Very good Dui Defense work.<//Text>

I was charged with a DUI, and found this law firm on Yelp. I went in for a consultation and ended up signing up after a one hour meeting. Dorsay was my attorney and she always kept me informed as to everything that was happening with my case. My case ended up being reduced to a wet reckless and my driver’s license was not suspended. Everything worked out very well. I highly recommend this law firm to everyone.</Text>

<Text>This review is 4yrs overdue but that’s the only way it could be accurate. H Law Group are awesome and I waited 4yrs so that I can give a comprehensive review.
In 2014 I was arrested on a DUI. I chose this law firm because somebody had the courtesy to leave a good review. What sold me was that Nima replied to the reviews personally. I had to travel to downtown LA for our meeting but their address is not hard to find. Our first meeting was respectful and I knew I had made the right choice, my wife wasn’t so sure. That was the first and only time I had to meet face to face with Nima. His team of able associates made the rest of the process easy for me. They all have the customer service, empathy, responsiveness and etiquette of a 5 star hotel. I was given an affordable payment plan to settle the fees in 3 or 4 installments. They kept me updated through an online portal and replied promptly to all my inquiries. On my court date, I met with the associate who would be going into the court room with me for a quick briefing. Then she went inside to get ready. As I waited other guys were also meeting with their lawyers outside and I couldn’t believe how those lawyers spoke to them with disrespect. One lawyer had over 20 cases that morning, no way he was going to give each client personalized attention. I thanked God for leading me to H Law and not to those sharks. My time in court was simple, I spoke only when spoken to and let my lawyer take full control. Because I had refused the breath test or to offer a blood sample, DMV suspended my license for 12 months. That was tough but not as tough as going for AA meetings, DUI class or doing community work. I haven’t drank since my arrest and I couldn’t taste a drop of alcohol ever again. Nima told me on our first meeting, none of his clients ever get a second DUI. I had a free counselling session that day in 2014 and I left that office better for having met Nima. I was promised that once I finished my court probation H Law would help me file for my case to be expunged and get the court records sealed. I’m happy to say that they lived up to their word and despite having many current cases, they treated my old case as if it was a new one and promptly got my case dismissed. No bill was sent to me. Now that’s what I call integrity, H Law is the firm you need if you have a DUI. Great job H Law!<//Text>< pics>

I just want to say that my family and I are very thankful for this law firm. I am the father of three and got into a fight at my son’s soccer match. I was defending my son, and for whatever reason the police officer ended up arresting us both. I had used Nima’s services before and gave him a call, the charges ended up getting dismissed. Best wishes to this law firm and I strongly wish nothing but joy and success for them.< /text>

I have never needed a lawyer for anything, so I was completely lost when I had to look for a dui lawyer. I asked around, and posted a message on my facebook and two of my friends ended up recommending the same firm (H&M Law Firm). I decided to give them a call and I signed up after my consultation.
The service that I received was very good, all of my questions were always answered in a timely fashion. I have issues with anxiety and my attorney really helped me stay calm during this very scary time in my life. I went to their office on a few different occasions and every time I felt a hundred times better. I have never had any run ins with the law so I can not begin to describe how terrifying this whole process was for me but my Angie and Nima really helped me out with everything. Everything worked out at the end for me and I am very happy with the results. Thank you for everything H&M Law Firm.</Review>

I was stopped by the CHP and ended up being charged with a DUI. I searched through the internet and could not make my mind up about an attorney. Luckily a coworker of mine referred me to the h&m law firm. This is an amazing group of attorneys that understand how stressful dealing with a court case can be. Eventually my attorney was able to dismiss the case and as a result nothing went on my record. I can not praise this law firm enough, if you are in need of a DUI attorney trust me and give these guys a call.<//Text>

Nima is a great attorney. We regularly refer him our DUI cases because how much pride him, and his DUI law firm, take in helping clients. We've heard nothing but great things about the quality of service his los angeles dui attorneys provide.<//Review>

<review>Got a dui in downtown after leaving cliftons. Got stopped at a checkpoint amd thought I was totally fine. I drank two beers and spoke to the officers just fine. The officers then said  they smelled alcohol on my breath.  So I did the test and blew A 0.07. They still gave me a dui. So i hired this lawfirm and they did a-z. Didnt call them once, but they regularly did update me. They did dmv stuff and ended up getting my case dismissed.</review><pics>None<//pics><rating>5< /rating><time>1510898244576<//time></record></dataset><record>

Nima Haddadi represented me in my DUI case. On my search for the greatest DUI attorney, I ended up interviewing three different attorneys. I ended up choosing Nima Haddadi because of his background and his confidence. I also really liked the fact that his firm offered payment plans because I clearly had not saved any money for a rainey day attorney savings pot. Everyone at the firm always got back to me and answered my questions and all of my concerns. I am truly grateful to have Nima as my lawyer and kudos to this law firm for having such amazing people on their team!< /review>

Incredible place. To leave the story untold I will admit that I witnessed the owner perform a act of sheer heroism. I visited with with Jersey people and ran into other Jersey people so it is safe to say the bagels are class. Great vegan fare.</Review>

<Text>Excellent chai (there is a non-sweetened version!) and organic / fair-trade coffees.  This is a cute little neighborhood coffee, sandwich / salad / soup spot. I've tried most of their menu and was never disappointed. The frittatas on Fridays through the weekend are the best.

Other than the frittata, I love the bacon-roasted turkey sandwich on fresh made (in house!) bread. They also have a lot of gluten free pastries now!! Highly recommended.<//Text>< Response>

This spot is great! They serve a wide variety of items and they've got friendly staff. Pictured below is the new Golden State Warriors sandwich featuring Draymond's Greens, Steph's Curry, and some Jordan Bell-peppers.
If you're in the area you've gotta check Dee Spot out.</Review>

Ordered Teriyaki Chicken over rice and Garlic Noodles. The rice was very hard, I could not eat it. I called to voice my concern and was told to come back for a replacement.  I went back the next day and the food was just as bad as it was the day before. This time the food looked totally different, the Teriyaki chicken had parsley this time but barely any sauce, and the chicken wasn't cut. The Garlic Noodles was way too spicy and the next day I ordered non spicy and to my surprise, they had a vinegary taste. I had to wait 45 minutes to get my food, but I was told that it would  be 15 minutes. Only 2 customers was ahead of us. I don't  recommend this place if you want quality food and timely service.<//text>

< review>
I am so confused by all the negative reviews. I walked in,and was kindly greeted by the owner almost immediately. He asked me if i wanted breakfast or lunch. I said breakfast, he recommended the breakfast sandwich on the Texas toast. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICHES IN THE EAST BAY. Yes, it's a bit greasy (like a good b-fast sandwich should be) but not too much to handle. I was blown away at the care he took in making it for me. The coffee was solid. The guy who runs this place really cares about his craft, don't know why all these people are hating. He makes juices from scratch in the mornings! Give this place a shot. It's really pretty good. It's not Farley's but it deserves to stick around.   And don't trust anyone reviewing bagels on the west coast - if they're not going to bagel shops for their bagels, then they don't know anything... Try the Texas toast! Dee Spot is doing something different in a nice way.< /review>

I've only has the bacon, egg, and cheese and coffee, but for a local joint it's good. Definitely get their Cold Brew it's delicious and they put time into making it. Great notes and flavors. They are also always trying to experiment with new dishes and the menu, so you'll always see something new when you go in. Go here for a good vibe. On Uber Eats!<//text>

<review>High quality ingredients. Friendly people. Awesome espresso. Awesome drip. Seriously, the best espresso I've tried in this neighborhood.

Plus every season they have a free blind coffee tasting to let the community decide which local beans they'll use for that session.

They're new and still figuring a few things out but they have a good thing going on, and I'm sure it will only get better from here.< /review>< pics>

Josh & Chan make a great cappuccino! I go out of my way for it. Also, they just started baking their own GF bread in house - so awesome. Chan's a great guy & he goes out of his way to talk with (and listen to) his customers in order to understand our preferences.

They also do a regular coffee tasting survey - which determines some of the coffee that will be available over the next month(s); and, they also did a poetry slam around the holidays & are looking to start bringing in live musicians on some Sunday mornings.

*I was just chatting with Chan & discovered that they donate all excess pastries & other expired foods to the local community on a weekly basis!*

Bottom line is that Dee Spot is definitely putting their best foot forward to contributing to, and being a part of the local community.< /text>

<resp>{'time': 1487220241882, 'text': 'Hi Lindsey,\nI work there everyday and I don\'t recall saying or having anyone say "maybe you don\'t like this kind of roast".  I understand everyone has a different taste palette for coffee.  We respect that.  This roast is a community picked roast.  Not burnt and not too sour.\n\nThe eggs and veggies are the same as Farley\'s, so this really befuddles me.  Same suppliers and eggs that they use.  Olive oil or coconut oil is used over vegetable or canola oil.\n\nAs far as running out of things, this is to keep high food quality.  We\'d rather not serve out of date food or poor quality food.'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Please do not let the 5-star ratings lead you astray. I've given it multiple tries and been disappointed every time. And I really tried! But after too many "we're out of all the things" and "oh maybe you just don't like this kind of roast", I'm sad to say I will not be visiting Dee Spot again. Good bye Farley's cool neighborhood vibes, decently priced and delicious food.  Hello greasy, overpriced eggs with random veggies and coffee that tastes like dirt. Sad day y'all.</Review>

Dee service and Dee Food at Dee Spot has gone down Dee Drain.

Just avoid it. You're welcome.<//Review>

Unlike franchises with set rules and restrictions, we are always improving with the community and each day we are involved with events, charities, non-profits, as well as catering to many companies in the area now.  With teaching cooking classes, pop-up dinners, our hands are quite busy, but we are friendly and willing to make your meal an enjoyable one.  Don't hesitate to let us know how you like your eggs cooked, or your allergies in the salads, and we'll be delighted to make it to your liking.

We are proud to be in the community and servicing companies with large catering orders and I hope you'll return."}<//response>

We came in thinking it was Farleys... Looks like Dee Spot took over the building before they got their act together. Bad customer service, over priced, stale bagels, everyone seemed upset at their food - overall bad vibe. Saving grace was the barista made a decent red eye and apologized for the 20 minute wait to make a toasted bagel.<//text>

<Review>Small but good and vey clean place with a salt room and body scrubbing. Take your own towel, as they give you only two small towels which wasn’t enough for me. I’ve been there twice and at my first visit the steam room was ridiculously hot, I could not stay there literally more than several seconds. At my last visit the temperature was exactly as it should, not too hot and I could even relax there. I hope the management fix the temperature so people can enjoy it.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I love to go to Family Health Center for soaking in the hot tubs , steam sauna , very good body scrub and massage , especially by Monika! It is affordable. The only think I would improve is creating vivid Signs or reminders to keep guest group noise down . But I understand it depends when I go I try to use time when there is less people.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDtn9XUUng60TwQC0JslXFWK4dH2zQfgGg-sTQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcaed5b83fdd3:0xeb4f6a0fd67c0e06<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>This is the first place that charges an entrance fee when purchasing a scrub massage package. There is no other place that I have been to that does this. Even five star hotels do not charge an entrance fee with Spa services. Also for their tremendous lack of upkeep. This being a spa facility, it is not very clean and standard spa renovations have never been done since this place opened re than 10 years ago. Water faucets in the sauna areas are always broken, poor water pressure, and mold like smell in the steam room. I do not recommend this place for a stress free relaxing spa experience to feel rejuvenated and clean.< /review><Name>Lora Kim<//Name>< Date>

I like this place, I have been going there for years. Body scrubs are excellent, overall experience is relaxing. I enjoy salt floor dry saunas and heated marble slab for relaxing afterwards.</Text>

< Review>
I would recommend a 4 star rating for the facilities. This is my first time visiting and I'm very comfortable here. Got the body scrub and thought it was ok since it's my first time.

Body scrub for 3ish stars:
Pros- the lady worked hard and is on the clock, she scrubbed me down EVERYWHERE
Cons- she was not dressed doing it, language barriers

I don't think I'm used to workers shower inside the facility. But I guess it's nothing out of ordinary. They all had under garments on... again still not used to it.

The facility is old school giving me the 90s vibe but is mostly clean. I'm first doing the body scrub then going out to the rooms which I think should have been the other way around but I'm using the most of what I have.</Review>

<rate>2< /rate><Text>This is only my third Korean spa. So far it's the least favorite. You get two towels. In others you get as many as you need. You also receive shots and a t-shirt. In the men's area there are two pools in a walk in, walk out style. One is warm and the other lukewarm.  I expected hot and cold pools with space for more than the people each. The steam room was unusable for me. The stream was so hot it felt as if my ears were scolded. I think the thermostat is broken. There is a box on the wall with wires visible inside. The door handle was too hot to touch, I used the towel to push my way out. I tried sitting in there with the door slightly ajar but that causes a lot of steam outside. I have been to many steam rooms with no problems. This one feels way too hot to use. No one was in there while I visited

There is a coed rest area with sleeping mats and a TV . Next door is an active kitchen and the oily smell and noise from cooking and the  music the cook listens to permeates the rest area. There is a hot room and two salt rooms accessible from the rest area that you can only enter dressed in the outfit you are given. In my opinion entering a sauna fully dressed is uncomfortable and not hygienic.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Owners trying to save on everything. Sauna steam was turned off at 9:45pm while we were still in (instead of 10:30pm as advertised). You are asked to bring your dirty dishes back to the kitchen after meal!! So much for relaxation and service!

There's a way better sauna at Korea town in Sunnyvale on El Camino close to Lawrence exit. Go there instead seriously!<//text>

Small bath area. And there are only two dry saunas. The wet sauna in the bath area is ridiculously hot. The counter attendant kept pressuring me to buy a pack of ten entrance tickets. I'm glad I didn't.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A compact Korean super sento. $ 25 for bathtub $ 2, steam sauna, washroom $ 5, two towels and on-site vest. The bathtub is about 42 degrees and one about 24 degrees. Steam saunas are insanely hot. There is also a rest room with an ondol and a small canteen. Not very clean.

(Translated by Google) I just called to find out the price, and a woman told me when she answered me saying "Don't call me to find out the price".

It's so amazing to be able to operate with this etiquette.

방금 가격을 알아보기 위해 전화를 했는데 어떤 아주머니께서 전화를 받으시면서 하시는 말씀이 "가격 알아볼려구 전화 하지마요" 끊어버리시네요

5 STARS!! We had a fantastic first-time home buying experience with Trillion Real Estate!! Gloria Escamilla was our realtor and she was phenomenal. Not only did Gloria educate us, she was extremely responsive, professional, patient, genuine and kind. Trillion Real Estate team work so efficiently and was instrumental in closing in 21 days!!  We couldn't have made a better choice. Ask for Gloria - she is one of a kind!!<//text>

Tyson and his team were amazing to work with.  The process was seamless from start to end. I have had the pleasure working with Tyson on both sides of a real estate transaction when representing clients, I could not have had a better experience. We can't wait to work with Tyson's team again in the future.< /Review>

<Review>Tyson helped us purchase our first home and I cannot overstate how easy and comfortable he made the whole process.

As first time homebuyers, the process of purchasing is nothing short of daunting. Tyson truly made it an enjoyable experience. Even though Tyson frequently represents clients with properties several times more valuable than our own, he made us feel that our purchase was every bit as important to him.

When we had difficulty getting responses from other parties involved in the purchase, Tyson remedied these issues with haste. I would shoot a text to Tyson, he would respond in minutes, and just minutes later I would get a call from the other party. Simply put, Tyson gets things done.

We closed on our home in the beginning of 2020, and Tyson still checks in with us to make sure things are going well. When we are ready to purchase another home, there is no doubt that Tyson will be our go-to guy.

Whether you are a first time buyer, or looking to sell your multi-million dollar estate, Tyson has you covered. Give him a call and see for yourself. Tyson is the most genuine, hard working realtor out there - and you'll know it from the first conversation you have with him.

Thank you for everything Tyson!< /Review>< Pics>

<text>We are really grateful for Bridgett and Tyson at Trillion Real Estate! As first-time home buyers, my wife and I were in great need of experienced professionals who are knowledgeable of Temecula/Murrieta/Menifee and surrounding areas, as well as the current competitive market climate and what it takes to get a buy offer accepted. From the first time we reached out to Tyson (broker) and Bridgett (real estate agent), they answered our questions immediately, provided thoughtful recommendations, and continuously followed-up with us throughout the home buying process. Bridgett and Tyson are true professionals, always allowing time to ask questions while not being rushed, and an absolute pleasure to work with - during negotiations we always felt they had our best interests in mind.

The process went so smoothly. It only took a few days before we placed our first offer, which was accepted, despite multiple offers made on the property. Bridgett guided us through the process, and we landed our first choice, and just successfully closed escrow! Bridgett and Tyson are a great resource who are very knowledgeable about the process and met our motivation as buyers. They made very thoughtful recommendations, and helped us to consider things we hadn’t thought of before. We would definitely reach out to Tyson and Bridgett in the future, and we would gladly recommend Trillion Real Estate to all our friends and family, and anyone who is considering buying a home in this highly competitive market!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80db7fb57c9cf0f1:0x25af826a8529a5f6< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Working with Tyson at Trillion Real Estate was an absolute dream! We reached out to Tyson after reading such great reviews about Trillion. We had a meeting on zoom, he answered all our questions and helped us understand the ins and outs of Temecula since we were moving from about an hour away. As we moved along with the process Tyson and his team were always just a call or text away. We ended up getting the first place we put an offer on, as first time homeowners I would think this is unheard of. But truly we believe this is because of Tyson and his years of experience and reputation in the area. The escrow process was so easy and Tyson really helped guide us along the way as we purchased our very first home. If 1,000 stars was an option that would be our rating! So grateful to have found Trillion, Tyson and to have worked with such an amazing team!<//review>

<review>Tyson Robinson real estate is simply "THE BEST".  I am very pleased with the professionalism, knowledge, and the level of effort he puts forth.  Finding a real estate person is easy but finding one that you can trust is a different story.  From day one, his team had a plan and executed it.  If I ever move back to the area, he is the first one I am calling so that I can purchase a home.   Thanks Tyson and Team...Your team was outstanding!< /review><user_name>Greg Rose< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Very happy to recommend Tyson and his team! I have known Tyson for a long time. I also follow all of his social channels where he is always dropping knowledge on real estate and educating me. I recently stopped by his office to discuss my home and what the market is for it and was very grateful for his help. I highly recommend him for any real estate deals or rental property management in the Inland Empire and Southern California! Thanks Tyson! 🤘🏻< /Review>< Pictures>

I’ve been with Tyson’s company for years now. I was originally introduced by another property manager. She had been in charge of my home and was preparing to retire. Just before her retirement she recommended I go with Tyson Robinson because she’d felt with him in the past and admired how well he took care of his clients. In my experience her assessment was spot on! If you’re looking to buy, sell or rent out your home give his team a try. I was assigned Veronica and she’s been fantastic!<//review>

Tyson and his entire team are awesome! Everyone is honest, reliable and trustworthy but most importantly everyone is very kind and genuine. Veronica specifically has been so helpful with all of my questions and concerns as a tenant for the past 3 years. I look forward to using Tyson and his team in the near future to purchase a new home!<//Review>

We bought our first home with the help of Tyson, he was recommended by a coworker I have to say he was the best! If we had any questions or concerns he always got back to us right away, he was very friendly and professional. I will most Definitely  recommend him to family and friends. Keep up the amazing work!<//Review>

<Review>I have been using Tyson and his team for managing our rental property over one year.  I was looking for a property manager in Temecula area. The fact that Tyson answered all my questions thoroughly within half an hour via email on a late Friday night really impressed me ! I have then worked with Veronica quite bit since I started to use Tyson’s team to manage my rental.  I’ve been very pleased with her dedication to her client, prompt response to any questions/concerns I may have, light speed to address property issues… I would highly recommend Tyson and his team!<//Review><resp>{'time': 1614968122807, 'text': 'Thanks Coco!

<Text>Tyson represented the seller on the house I just bought. I contemplated leaving this review for a month but decided people should know what we experienced especially since he owns his own company! My offer was contingent and they accepted knowing that, long story short the offer on my condo had a hiccup and didn’t close in time, therefore pushed my closing date 2 weeks out. Not only did he threaten to send us fees but he also allowed the seller to take the ring doorbell and the nest and basically told us too bad because you didn’t close on time. Next time don’t take a contingency because they don’t always close on the exact date! He was extremely rude and unprofessional to my agent and also told her he didn’t work on weekends so don’t bother trying to contact him. I would not recommend him at all!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80db7fb57c9cf0f1:0x25af826a8529a5f6< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is the second time we have worked with Tyson in the past few years. He helped us buy our first house in Murrieta and most recently helped us sell and purchase our new home. Couldn't be happier with the quality of service. Whether early in the morning or late at night, Tyson has always been quick to respond to any update or question I had. Highly recommend.

We reached out to Tyson to find us a place to rent and by the end of that day he found us the perfect home. He’s always willing to go above and beyond for his customer and my wife and I really appreciate it. We recommend him to anyone looking to buy/ rent / or just inquire basic info for what it takes to qualify for a home.</Review>

I worked with Tyson before he had a big team. He gave me a personal touch and was outstanding to work with directly. I came back 4 years later and boy had his company grown!!! I still got outstanding service. The team is a reflection of an outstanding leader.<//review>

<Review>We are so happy with our experience as customers of Trillion Property Management. Everyone on the staff is friendly and attentive and being able to securely pay our monthly rent online is extremely convenient. The one time we had a non-urgent issue at our property and requested service, the team was on it within hours of submitting our request. We are impressed and would certainly recommend them.<//Review><rating>5</rating><gmap_id>0x80db7fb57c9cf0f1:0x25af826a8529a5f6< /gmap_id><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

I highly recommend Tyson Robinson Realty. Tyson did an amazing job helping me find a new house to buy. Having rented through the property management side of his business, I knew he was honest and truly cared about his clients. My entire experience was smooth because Tyson and his team are topnotch.</Review>

Honest, reliable, and professional kind of service  is how to explain Tyson Robinson and his Team. When I brought my 1st home it was a seamless process working with Tyson. He takes your needs and wants serious and ensures to match them with the best buying options. He knows his stuff! Loved working with Him and his Team!< /text>

Tyson and his Team are The Best!

When we decided, on a whim,  to sell our home Tyson was there to help us.   He guided us through the process which included re-financing,  selling and buying a new home all within a very short time frame.  He gets things done quickly and professionally.  He also has a great network of professionals from landscaping to financing, it's nice to have someone who can refer you to others to get things done,  all of his referrals have been wonderful.
It's nice to have a Realtor and Friend with such a great reputation in the business. Everyone Loves Tyson and his Team of Professionals.

We proudly tell people Tyson Robinson is our Realtor.<//Review>

This is a long overdue review.  Tyson Robinson and his team handled one of our rental properties, got us great tenants, and eventually represented us when we sold said rental property in Murrieta. He and his team were always very responsive with any questions we had. I highly recommend Tyson Robinson for any real estate needs you may have. Thank you Tyson Robinson and team!!!< /Text>

Tyson Robinson and his team helped my mom sell our family home of 22 years. After putting our house up for sale, we were able to sell the house within three days. His team were honest, quick, and listened to our needs/wants. Tyson is such a respectful and trustworthy realtor. My husband and I will be going to him soon when it’s time for us to buy/rent a home.</Review>

Working for Tyson, I've seen how he truly cares for his clients; whether past, present, or future. He's prompt, reliable, and keeps everything as transparent as possible. Not only does he treat his clients like family, he truly cares about the relationships he has with them! Would recommend Tyson to anyone and everyone! He really is the best!< /Review>

Tyson and his team are extremely helpful in all aspects of real estate. Whether it be buying/selling or renting a property, they are there to help. Response time to inquiries is fast and helpful with information on the spot. They are very personable and look to provide an individual experience. My experience was renting a property with some friends and they helped guide us through the process efficiently and honestly.</Text>

Have been using Tyson and his team for property management for our house in Temecula for almost a year now. Our decision to use them came down to how welcoming and down to earth the team was when we first met them! First Impression are everything. I'm in early 20's so I worried a lot about the quality of the people we decided to let manage our property and they were the ones who left a lasting impression on us. The team treated us like family and friends from the start and didn't mind answering any questions we had throughout the process. They made it very simple and stress free for us. By the time they took pictures our house and uploaded onto the market we had potential renters interested in it that week and decided on our renters by the end of the month. We have had zero issues with them and they have given us the peace of mind we were looking for.So if you are doing your research on potential property managers like we once did, I would look no further then Tyson and his team.</text>

< review>
Tyson is the best real estate agent in Temecula! We had two condos to sell and a house to buy this summer while I was 8 months pregnant. Tyson got it done! He gave us great advice and expectations for the sale of our condos. He sent a professional photographer over to our places and the listing photos were stunning, highlighting everything we knew potential buyers would love. On the day of the listing for the first condo, Tyson had 9 showings set up before it even hit the MLS! The first person to view it put in an offer immediately and after a few times back and forth we came up with a perfect selling agreement. Tyson negotiated terms for us so that we were able to stay in the condo renting back from the buyer until we closed on our new home which was essential being pregnant. The other condo took a little longer to sell as it was a one-bedroom and there were 5 other identical properties on the market. However, with Tyson’s network and expertise he was able to sell that for us as well, and coordinated the closing within a day of purchasing our dream home. We are beyond thrilled with the service and care that we received from Tyson and his team. All the closings went very smoothly with no unexpected delays or issues.< /review>

<Text>Tyson was fantastic in the purchase of our first home! Without his help and expertise, it would not have been possible. Tyson is patient, kind, and very professional. He is a genuinely nice and honest person, which is hard to find these days. Additionally, Tyson is supported by a staff of amazing people. His entire team helps to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible. Their communication was excellent and we were informed of every step of the home buying process. Tyson showed us properties in our budget and in the areas we desired. He did not waste our time, which we appreciated. Tyson is always accommodating and we are so grateful that he was our realtor. We would not hesitate to use his services again. I would also recommend Tyson for his property management services. Tyson and his team know the Temecula Valley and are knowledgeable about the real estate market and give solid, realistic advice. Years later, we still keep in touch with Tyson as he has great insight. He offers an experience for his clients unlike anyone in the industry and that is because he truly cares. Thank you Tyson!</Text><user>113911865365780336212<//user><name>Tori Baird</name><time>1527194325849<//time>< pictures>

I've been with Trillion Really Estate for almost 2 years. I only had a month to look for rentals in Murrieta because we lived in North County and our lease was ending. I was also 9 months pregnant with my second, so I was basically house hunting online. I have to give major props to Veronica for being super helpful during such a hectic time in my family's life. Every single member of Tyson's team was extremely helpful in getting us the rental we wanted, within the month that we needed to move. They are very prompt with their responses to any questions I had and still have. They treat us with nothing but kindness and respect and greatly appreciate everyone at that company. I have recommended them to people that are interested in living in the Murrieta area, because I've worked with another property management company before them, and Trillion is hands down a lot more caring and helpful.<//text>

The first property sold when I was oversea for long visit, Tyson took care of everything from head to toes,  made house look fantastic with very minimal cost, and repair/remodel/design so quickly; attracted multiple offers with very qualify buyers; the 2nd property also have multiple offers within 3 days from listing and we choose the full cash buyer; both closed escrow timely! now the 3rd property is already in escrow with tenant still in the house! We have very little or near no down time because of Tyson's extreme efforts and expertise!  It is too good to be true and indeed I feel very fortunate to work with him!!!

Working with Tyson over many years now I have witnessed a true professional in action. He is a Real Estate Broker with the utmost care and concern for his clients and their needs. He is one who is responsive, genuinely concerned about the satisfaction of his clients, and he gives back in multiple ways. He is knowledgeable, innovative, extremely hard working, and it is no surprise to me to see his success. I completely understand why homeowners and homebuyers so often choose Tyson to help them buy or sell their home!<//Review>

<review>Coming from Orange County, I needed a realtor who knew the Temecula valley well. Tyson and his team were awesome in helping us find the areas that best suited my family's needs.
What I felt made my experience with Tyson great was how well he balances giving you your own space, but being available when you need him. The relationship felt more like a friendship than "business." I felt comfortable asking him for his honest opinion on matters while deciding on a home. I never felt pushed one way or another. His opinion is not overbearing. By nature, he is easy going and grounded. This made me really appreciate his input and knowledge.
If the idea of a pushy realtor scares you, then go with Tyson.< /review><userid>107648634364067648552</userid>< user_name>

Tyson was amazing! We luckily found Tyson by reading all the good reviews from past clients and he didn't disappoint. My mom needed to sell her home as she was retiring and needed to downsize to a smaller property. He listed my mother's home and it was in escrow within a week. He also was very patient and responsive to my mothers wants and needs and we found the perfect home for my mom. It was all a smooth transaction from the listing to the buying of a another home for my mom. He didn't miss a beat and it was very easy to work with him! He is very knowledgable and an expert in his field.</Review>

We are so happy we found Tyson.
He has the best work ethic and is quick with responses.
He really goes out of his way to make everything smooth and easy when buying or looking for a home.
His level of professionalism is above and beyond.
If you're looking to buy or sell, we highly recommend him.
He sold our house within 3 days after listing it, and his entire team is great to deal with.</Review>

We loved working with Tyson through the process of selling our house. Words can’t even express how much We greatly appreciate his devotion and he truly wants the best for his clients. Tyson took the time with us even before we committed to start the process and he learned our wants & needs and is such an awesome realtor! We also want to say a huge thank you to his team as they gave their time and greatly helped us also with the sell of our house pretty fast. We couldn’t have done all that without you and your team!< /Review>

<review>Tyson was referred to us by a good friend that lived in Temecula. Since we were looking for a house in the San Marcos or Carlsbad area, it did not make sense to hire someone from Temecula, but my friend insisted I should at least meet him. Well, we met with Tyson and liked him right away, we explained to him that we were looking for a house in San Diego County and he said it was not a problem as he knew the area well. He drove down to San Marcos about 25 times (poor guy) to show us properties, we never felt pressured for us to "pick a house and buy it already". He was always understanding if we saw a house but didn't like it for one reason or another. I kid you not, we saw a bunch of houses, but we needed one with a full bathroom downstairs as we have our elderly mother in law living with us. If you have looked at real estate you know that is hard to find, and when you do, it's an older house that needs remodeling. Well, Tyson found the perfect house, in perfect condition in a neighborhood called Belleza near Cal State. We love our place and could not be happier with Tyson's work ethic and dedication to his clients. I, like my friend, highly recommend Tyson for your next real estate transaction.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Tyson and his team have been nothing short of amazing! Whether by phone, email, or text, they’ve been great at giving me peace of mind while managing my property in Murrieta with me living some 2,500 miles away. His employee, Veronica, is the truth! Without them, I’d dread and resent the decision of keeping my home when I moved to the East Coast. Thanks Tyson Robinson Team!!</review>

< Review>
We worked with Jasmin to buy a place in the Temecula area and couldn't be happier that we found her (and Tyson too!).  We looked at a few other agents but they were too large for our taste and we were just thrown onto a distribution list with no follow-up.  Seemed like they wanted us to call them when we saw something!

We were in the process of selling our condo in LA and buying in Temecula and every time we were able to come into town to look at properties Jasmin was always available and responsive to our needs.  Throughout the several months that it took for us to finally find a place that we were completely happy with, Jasmin was always there and the attention to us never wavered.  There were a lot of needs (and wants) and I lost track of how many homes we looked at but Jasmin was always professional and showed no frustrations (if there was any at all) about my pickiness.

We would definitely work with Trillion again and will refer all of our friends and family to them!< /Review>

I loved how he seemed like I was talking to a friend and not a pushy realtor. I was going through some very difficult times taking care of my terminally ill mom so it was comforting to find Tyson. I was able to trust him and have one less huge responsibility taken care of for me.  Tyson was on my side. I never told him what I was going through but I felt like he just knew and he handled everything so professionally and patiently.  During the next year, as my mom’s health worsened, I had to sell more of my properties. I, without hesitation, went directly to Tyson. He never knew, but my mom ended up passing away and I was just happy to have someone I could trust to handle 3 house sales for me during what I consider the most stressful time of my life.

<time>1527614119459< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>I wanted to wait a bit to write this review in case Tyson and his team do not live up to expectations. I can now confirm that they have, and exceeded them as well.

Prior to hiring Trillion Real Estate to manage my property, I was working with another person from another company and that was underwhelming. I paid her $100 a month (I'm paying Trillion $99) to manage my property, but manage she did not. I had to deal with the tenants myself, had to collect rent myself, had to basically do everything myself. She just acted as a third-party intermediary, often slowing things down and adding confusion to the mix.

Then I consulted with another management company to prepare my property for rental and they were inflexible and not very accommodating. Finally, I reached out to Tyson and they were just INCREDIBLE.

First, they were willing to list my property for rental AND to sell to see which would yield the best result. Mind you, this adds much more work on their end because they had to do showings on weekends to potential buyers and then show the home to potential renters. But they did it, without extra charge.

We ended up renting our property and they have been managing it since January of this year. And it's been smooth-sailing ever since. They take care of everything for me. I'm the type who do not want to be involved at all, so they only email me to get approval on any work that needs to be done on the property. They take care of the rest.

Tyson, Veronica, and Ernie are the dream team and I would definitely go to them for anything property-related. Rental? Trillion. Selling? Trillion. Buying? Trilion. You're in good hands.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

We have been remote landlords with our house in Murrieta for 4 yrs.  We hired a different company to begin with - that was a mistake.  We fired them and moved to Tyson.  Since switching to Tyson Robinson, we have been very happy.  Veronica is on top of everything and makes us feel much better about being out of state.  They have been responsive to our needs and the needs of our lessee.  I recommend Tyson Robinson.< /review>

Tyson Robinson helped my wife and I find our dream home! He was always available to answer any questions and really went beyond our expectations. He took the time to show us other listing and when we found what we were looking for, he worked hard to get us the best deal possible and make the whole buying process smooth. He is a real pro, very respectful, I will recommend Mr. Robinson to all family members and friends! "Thank you for your excellent services".</review>

Tyson helped my wife and I buy our first house in Temecula. We were also renting from him prior to buying and he was great. Everything was top notch and he was there for us with all of our questions and answered everything we needed. Truly great experience with Tyson and everyone in his office. Highly recommended!!!<//text>

June marks one year of using Tyson & team as our property management for our rental home in Temecula & we couldn’t be happier! First timer at the rental game & I initially started out with another company because a family friend knew someone, who knew someone, that worked with this other company. I quickly felt uneasy with how everything was unfolding & regretted not first contacting Tyson Robinson. I put up with the other company for almost two weeks & kept looking back at all of Tyson’s wonderful reviews & I finally called him & immediately felt that it was going to be in good hands! I dumped the other prop management & Tyson instantly was on the ball with the process. While everything was starting up, my husband & were moving cross country! He took care of the tenants during the application process. Contract signings were easy. They were able to use their contacts to have a screen repaired that we weren’t able to do prior to our moving out. They organized for a house cleaning to be done & did the entire pre move in inspection with fine detail. Rent is always received on time. The tenant has reported one small concern so far but the team took care of it seamlessly, always keeping an open line of communication & responding quickly to us & the tenants. Seriously, this review could continue to get longer & I can keep going on about how much I appreciate this team of wonderful people but long story short, I have nothing negative to say! Everyone who I’ve worked with has been great!
Thanks Tyson & Team!<//Text>

I would recommend Tyson to my Family and friends and really anyone who needs to or wants to buy or sale a home. Tyson is honest, fair, aggressive and the bottom line is he gets the job done. The entire process was handled quickly and efficently.  He handled my sale very smoothly, considering it was a short sale that is impressive. Thanks again Tyson !!!!</Review>

<text>We had a rental house in Temecula and were remote landlords, so couldn't stay on top of the tenants. When the tenants stopped paying rent, we had them evicted and then Tyson was able to get into the house to see its condition. It was totally trashed. We had to replace all the carpeting, all the toilets and faucets, totally repaint, you name it. Tyson handled getting the contractors in and made sure the job was done right. Then, not being stupid, we decided to put the house on the market since being a remote landlord had not worked out so well. Tyson handled all the advertising, etc and we ultimately got a price we were happy with in a reasonable time frame. I think without Tyson  it would have been a grueling ordeal for us, being 1500 miles away.  Definitely recommended.</text>< UserId.>

We have only have been with Tyson and his team for 6 months but they have done a wonderful job marketing and renting our Temecula property.  They got a great renter in quickly.  Their accounting and bookkeeping is on time and also excellent.  I looked at other Temecula Property Management companies but Tyson and his team are the clear winners!< /text>

After emailing and contacting about a dozen property management groups in Temecula area, only two responding to all the questions.  After having a sit down with each my wife and I decided to go with Tyson to rent our property.  Three years later I can honestly say it was a good decision.  Our property has went through two tenants with only minor issues, which are always resolved quickly.  They have deconflicted a wind damaged fence, broken washing machine, refrigerator, and plumbing.  Considering we are currently living clear across the country it was and still is a great choice to go with Tyson.<//text>

Tyson Robinson is the epitome of professionalism, honesty, and just overall excellent customer service.  It was  very refreshing working with Tyson on the purchase of my home in Murrieta. As opposed to other agents that I've worked with, Tyson truly puts the customers needs as a no.1 priority.

Buying a home is a joyful time but it can also be very stressful. Tyson helped put my wife and I at ease by communicating with us and keeping us informed through every step of the home buying process. Tyson is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to real estate and he strives  to find his clients the exact property that fits their needs while not imposing his own.

I have recommended Tyson to some of my friends and they have purchased and sold various properties through him, they too have nothing but positive things to say about him. I can't say enough good things about him.< /Review>

Tyson and his team helped us get into our first new home. We were new to the market with no knowledge in it, a tight budget and houses were selling within days of posting. Despite all the obstacles we were facing, Tysons team were still able to get us into the only house we fell in love with. After escrow closed we learnt that our offer was accepted over others solely because they knew and trusted Tysons reputation. So believe it when they say it matters who is representing you! We are so glad we made the decision to go with Tyson and we are grateful for him and his team.

<review>My family and I rented a property in Temecula for a little over a year that Tyson and his team managed. It was a great experience and I cannot say enough good things about them. They were always very professional, courteous, and kind. Any service issues were addressed promptly.

A few months before we moved, the homeowner decided to sell the property. I was so nervous that we would be forced to live in chaos with realtors coming in and out whenever they pleased, but this was simply not the case. Tyson would always give plenty of notice before a showing, and would ask us if it was ok or if we would like to have it done another day. He and his team made the process as smooth as possible.

I wish we could have stayed in Temecula, but we had to move closer to San Diego. If we were to move back, We would love to rent from Tyson and his team again.</review><Time>1541531755457<//Time>< pics>

UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE!

We were told he would be showing house at 4 pm, we drove OVER TWO HOURS in traffic and were almost 15 minutes late and he was not there, when we tried to call him (2 separate times) he REJECTED ALL the calls and refused to answer, I emailed him after we started on the hour plus drive home only to get told the next day via email he left at 4:25 which is clearly a lie because we were standing in the drive way at that time, but my daughter had said when we were there she saw someone inside so who knows maybe he was inside with the door locked denying our calls! Then he tried to tell me we showed up at 4:30 but he said he left before then? He says 4:30 because that's when my email sent, but that email was sent when we were on the road already after our calls continued to be rejected!

NO APOLOGY, NO ATTEMPT TO REACH OUT....NOTHING!!!

I am so glad he failed to be where he said he would be and we avoided having to work with him.<//Review>

<Text>Burgers, tacos, ice cream, and fried food. The food is good, the rest is okay. Still, my family and I stop here all the time on our travels.

A good alternative to cookie-cutter fast food chains.

Bathrooms on premises are small and questionable. Generally not enough shaded seating or parking. All seating is outside.

I wanted to give it four stars, but upon final review, it's just okay at three stars.

Still, the food is good!<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Jolly Cone has something for everyone and their food is amazing!

They have veggie burgers, Mexican food, malts, ice cream, hamburgers, salmon burgers, chilli fries, etc.

I live with many dietary restrictions and was surprised such a teeny place would have food I could eat, that tasted FANTASTIC!</text>< pics>

Super good!! Everyone was super nice and all of the employees were wearing masks! Even though there was a bunch of people there the service was fast and great and everything was sanitary. They had a washing station to wash your hands and even a water bowl for your furry friends to drink from if they were hot.<//Text>

<review>Visited here today while on a road trip into Mono County.  Only stopped to pick up an Ice Cream Cone. Last day of a holiday weekend, and yet they were pushing through the lines fast, and getting our order out quick.  Maybe one day I’ll stop and get more than ice cream.  Looked like a nice small town place to stop and eat.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

This is one of those, "let's stop here!  This looks cool!" kind of places.  And it is. Cool.  But don't go here if you're expecting good food.  Go here to throw some fries or a burger at the kids to keep them from killing each other.  Go here for ice cream. The dipped vanilla is where it's at. And don't go here expecting a nice, refreshing Coca-Cola because they only have RC and I died a little inside when the lady told me.<//Review>

<Review>Decent old school roadside stop. Shakes and soft serves are good. Never tried the burgers. Pricey about 30% more than you would expect for this type place where you're sitting outside.
I saw burgers listed for a high as $9, we got 2 large and 1 regular shake for $19.
Everything in Bridgeport is high, but I guess since seasonal, they have a window of time to make their money.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Great food, good location for a traveling stop off. Prefect classic burger and onion rings, but it had a HUGE menu to choose from to help serve a diverse population including burritos and vegetarian items.</Review>

Came here after a long day out in the sun. Was craving a chocolate milkshake and fries. Man, I was not disappointed. Totally hit the spot! Customer service was on point as well as prices. But honestly, all I really cared about was the chocolate shake. This spot is a must to stop at during your travels on the 395.< /review>

Great food. We stop here every time we drive through Bridgeport. The hot dog buns are crispy. The Taco salad and fish taco are among the best I've found so far along Hwy 395.</text>

Burrito was greasy. Hamburger was average. Fried zucchini needs to be thinner and more crispy. Carmel Iced Coffee was great.</review>

If hell served a beef taco

A lot of people like this place as evidenced by the crowd.  We did not. Now, call us foolish to not order burgers or ice cream at a clearly classic burger/soft serve ice cream joint and compound that with ordering tacos. That said, my fish tacos we're pretty ok and my wife's beef tacos were absolutely the worst either of us have ever had. First she said no onions and they loaded them on both her tacos and side salad. Next, the beef. Oh the beef. If ever the environmental movement needed a clear way to dissuade the world to stop eating beef this would have worked. Overnight cessation of beef eating. Guaranteed. Greasy like crazy and a taste like, hmmm...I think an Amazon box sauteed with Schillings Taco Seasoning would win in side by side taste comparisons. My father who grew up with dire food shortages in Korea drilled into us to eat every grain of rice on our plates, a rule I mostly still follow and respect. I fully supported my wife stopping at bite three or so. I tried one bite and out of sheer awe tried one more.  I did the honors of tossing them as Jolly Kone was already closed by this moment of post prandial trauma. I don't so lightly slam a business nor another's cooking though judging by the crowds and online reviews my petty feedback will not damage business. But if you value and respect to any degree the art form that is the beef taco, I highly recommend that you pass on Tasty Kone's version.< /Review>

Aerial Pixels L.L.C. are AMAZING !!!!

Crashed my Mavic Pro but did not know where to send for repairs. I didn't want to deal with DJI due to their low response time with repairs so decided to do some research when I came across AerialPixels. Took a chance and I’m so glad I did. Their communication, workmanship on repairs and prices were exceptional. They completed and had my MP back to me within 4 days. Thanks a lot for the service Joe, I'm definitely a happy customer. See ya, gotta go flying !

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!!!!!

<text>This company is something else. I needed a last minute service and the company I usually go to was closed today. Joe answered my call and was happy to help. I showed up and he got right to work. Breath of fresh air and to be honest, I’m switching over to aerial pixels as my new go to. Simple, honest, good work. Extremely highly recommended. Ask Joe to tell you about his freak drone experiences.</text>< pictures>

These guys have truly saved my *ss.  Inspire 2 major crash... 2 other repair companies were too scared  to even touch this.  Aerial Pixels took it in their stride and really repaired it like new and even at a reasonable price!!!  I have flown drones since 2012 and flown over 1000 hours.  I recommend these guys above all others!!!< /Text>

We had one of our Inspire 2’s gimbal ribbon cable go and needed a fast turn around. The guys got it done in less than 24 hours. We’ve never experienced customer service this good and fast. Highly recommended! Thanks guys</Review>

They were extremely knowledgeable and thorough in explaining the process of repairing my Inspire 2 and any other inquires I may have had. The turn around time was incredibly fast (not expected!) and the price was reasonable.

I will definitely be a return client, hopefully not for the same issue I had before though! You will always be my top recommendation for repairs of these damn whirly birds.

Joe and Kim were amazing!  I had a drone accident in North Carolina and had it fixed locally down there.  Not only did that vendor not fix the issue, they actually created new problems during their repairs!  None of this was obvious to me (no errors showing) but when Joe took my drone apart, he saw all the issues and was able to fix everything and was super nice and courteous!  Definitely recommend!</text>

These guys are wonderful! Best drone repair in LA County. Ive just had my second repair done (I know...) and they turned it around in less than 24 hours. They even told me about repairs that I could cut to save money but they told me why they recommended them. The team is extremely knowledgable, friendly as can be, and fast as hell!< /Text>

<text>Been here a couple times now and there isn’t any other place I would be comfortable getting work done. Our Inspire II and Phantom 4 have both been repaired and are like new again, thanks to Joe at Aerial Pixels. From simply battery problems to our Inspire II rebuild, Joe is the only person I have had the faith in to do the job, he knows the business and is extremely helpful if your new to the industry. I recently had a small repair done (Inspire II battery issue) and I came to the shop, Joe fixed it in 30 min and I was on my way. I highly recommend Aerial Pixels, don’t trust your expensive equipment anywhere else.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>Highly recommended!!  I don't often leave reviews but these guys are exceptional.  I couldn't be any happier with the service I received from Aerialpixels!  After a crash, my Mavic Pro was having serious flight issues and I brought it in to Aerialpixels for service.  They had it back in working order and flying again perfectly in a couple days. Excellent service, very reasonable cost... this is THE place for drone repairs!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Joe and the team were very professional, assured me that they would fix the issue I was having with my drone, and they followed through within a turnaround time of less than 2 business days.  Their rates were reasonable and they were also very helpful.  Now I know who to come to if I ever have a technical issue with my drone.  I'm extremely thankful that I found and chose to do business with Aerialpixels.< /Text>< Response>

FAST is an understatement!  Mailed it on a Tuesday, got it back the following Tuesday; and it would have been sooner if Fedex hadn't slowed it down with their incompetence.  Honestly, it was a bit expensive; but, sometimes you have to pay for somebody's skills when things are "safely" beyond your own.  Overall, very happy :)</Text>

Feel free to ask as many questions as you need (I know I do) and they'll gladly answer them with patience to help you understand. Whether it's a small handheld drone or a film rig these guys have it covered. I HIGHLY recommend dropping by if you need anything drone-related.< /Review>< UserId.>

My experience with Joe was everything you've read - incredibly professional, FAST (repaired a broken arm within 4hrs same day!) and he went above and beyond to deliver the drone to my wife just after his closing time. Really amazing in every way. Thanks so much joe!<//text>

Why would you go anywhere else? Joe is a straight guy who knows his stufff. I brought in my Inspire 1 for a motor replacement on A Wednesday and today, Friday it's ready and here's the great part, I didn't need the motor after all. Joe saved me some good money and I'm so appreciative of his honesty. This is why I won't go anywhere else, neither should you. Thank you Joe.< /Text>

These guys go WAY above and beyond. I was in a rush to get my Mavic Pro fixed in time for my daughters wedding video.  To get a part in on time Joe (not the owner) ordered a part, over night, on his personal debit card.  Then he was willing to work after hours to get it fixed for me.  They replied to emails after hours and on holidays. Super helpful, professional and responsive.  Highly recommend.  Five stars plus!</review>

I just wanted to leave this 5 star review because they went out of their way to get my drone fixed and over-nighted to Las Vegas for shoot after crashing my drone a week before.  Amazing that in 1 week i had my drone back after crashing it into a tree and breaking the camera and one arm.  I doubt DJI would have gotten it done that fast.  Thank you!!!<//Review>

I had some training in the LA area and was driving there from the Salt Lake City. I purchased a used Iinspire 1, which needed some repairs and I just wanted a professional to look through it and give it a once-over if there was anything else that may have been wrong with it. I knew I needed to find somebody in California close to my route that could fix my drone and that I trusted.

I talked to Joe in the service department before I started the travels and he was the most helpful person I've met in the Drone industry so far. He knew the Drone inside and out and quickly did a turn around repair and his experience and knowledge is second to none.

I would recommend these guys above anyone. There are people that you meet and you can tell quickly that they care about what they do for a living and what they are passionate about and these guys are passionate about what they do for a living.
I just wish they had a store a little closer to me.< /text>< date>

I was extremely satisfied with the service, care, and attention to detail Joe was in handling my Mavic repair. They fixed it and I was up and flying the next day. He took a lot of time to explain and guide me through a lot of steps and care for my drone. Looking forward to taking their class as well. Aerialpixels ROCK!< /review>

Am an Ohio pilot and owner of a DJI Phantom 4 Pro. I stopped in unannounced for a diagnostic check up. Joe was very informative and understanding, took his time and explained everything. After a system check and calibration went outside to do a test flight. Joe was with me all the way and kept informing me of items I should be aware of. Couldn't be more pleased with his attention to detail. This is by far the "go to" place for any drone issues or repairs. Hope I won't need his super service in the future, but if I do, I'll be confident of his integrity and skill level and will not waste my time and money on DJI repair services. Thank you Joe, you are a true gentleman!!!</review>

<Review>These guys are for real the best.  I crashed my drone two days ago and I'm about to leave for Australia.  I walked in the store yesterday, dropped my Mavic pro off, and they had it ready for me the next day.  They even stayed  Open late because traffic kicked up on me on my drive there and I would arrive after they closed. But I called ahead and they kept it open for me. 5 stars.<//Review>< Resp>

I used them 5 month ago to fix my drone

The repair is holding together perfectly.

4/5 stars for the lack of communication in regards to prices charged, they were to call for approval before charging more if they found more damage.

Overall I would use them again.</review>

I had crashed my Mavic Pro and called Aerialpixels for help. They answered all of my questions and concerns promptly and professionally. When they received my damaged drone, they contacted me with the list of recommended repairs and an estimate.
Aerialpixels quickly initiated the repairs once I gave them the OK. They took payment by credit card and had my drone back to me promptly.  I took it for a test flight and everything is working perfectly once again...just like it was new.
Thank you, Aerialpixels, for your excellent service. Simply outstanding.< /Text>

I dropped my drone off for the shaking Gamble problem and I went to lunch. Took no time at all. Also got a great flight lesson for free. He probably noticed the physical damage and felt sorry for the Drone 😅😅😅. Great place and BTW, my drone is under the weather again, she'll be their soon.< /Text>

These guys were great from the start! I called in to ask for a quick quote and discuss my issue, and they took the time to listen to me ramble and provide feedback on what they thought the issue was and the ballpark cost. The entire process was so easy and the communication was great with where my drone was in the process of being repaired (emails and texts once received, repaired, and shipped). I sent the drone in on a Thursday, received a very fair quote early the next day, then they got the drone back to me the following Tuesday. Very quick turn around, much better than I would have expected.
But this is where I was most impressed - when I opened the box the drone came back with a broken part that seemed to have been caused by how FedEx handled the package. I emailed Aerialpixels to let them know as soon as I discovered the issue (at about 9p.m.)...they responded almost immediately and with no questions asked they apologized and sent me a prepaid return label within 30 mins so they could fix the issue. I sent it back yesterday, they fixed it today, and its on it's way back to me overnight delivery. That is how you run a business!!!</text>

Brought my DJI Phantom drone in for repairs after a bad crash.

I called first and very impressed with their knowledge and customer service. Then I drove 2.5 hours here from San Clemente, CA to drop off my drone for emergency repairs.

Now my drone is back to 100% operational!!! EVERYTHING works perfect!!!

I highly recommend.<//Review>

Was going to repair my drone myself (mavic pro)and was convinced otherwise and they made it worth leaving for them to get fixed. They even expedited the repair for me as a courtesy and did a great job!  Thanks!< /review>

Brought my DJI Phantom drone in for repairs after a bad crash.

I called first and very impressed with their knowledge and customer service. Then I drove 2.5 hours here from San Clemente, CA to drop off my drone for emergency repairs.

Now my drone is back to 100% operational!!! EVERYTHING works perfect!!!

I highly recommend.</text>

These guys were great from the start! I called in to ask for a quick quote and discuss my issue, and they took the time to listen to me ramble and provide feedback on what they thought the issue was and the ballpark cost. The entire process was so easy and the communication was great with where my drone was in the process of being repaired (emails and texts once received, repaired, and shipped). I sent the drone in on a Thursday, received a very fair quote early the next day, then they got the drone back to me the following Tuesday. Very quick turn around, much better than I would have expected.
But this is where I was most impressed - when I opened the box the drone came back with a broken part that seemed to have been caused by how FedEx handled the package. I emailed Aerialpixels to let them know as soon as I discovered the issue (at about 9p.m.)...they responded almost immediately and with no questions asked they apologized and sent me a prepaid return label within 30 mins so they could fix the issue. I sent it back yesterday, they fixed it today, and its on it's way back to me overnight delivery. That is how you run a business!!!< /Text>

Unbelievable experience! I haven’t flown my Mavic in some time and when I tried, I first had to update the firmware. After the successful update, I lost the ability to focus the camera, change exposure and the video. With hours of research online wasted I was losing hope. Contacted DJI and after 2 hrs of jumping through hoops, they told me it had to be sent in for repair as the latest firmware has a known issue. I’ve never been so frustrated. I decided to give AerialPixels a try and not only were they aware of the problem, they were the only ones who knew the solution. One day later I’m back in the air and somehow they got it to work with the new firmware!
Seriously can’t thank them enough!<//text>

<text>Incredible service,

Joe is incredible! I needed to get my Mavic fixed before I left for the UK and only had a few hours to get it done. He helped me with the part I needed and found other issues that I was unaware of, he fixed everything and educated me on all the things I needed to look out for in the future.

Killed it joe, thank you and Javie too.

If you are looking for an HONEST, RELIABLE & FAST drone repair place. Then look no further. These guys have the knowledge but not only that they are friendly. My Mavic Pro's flex cable came unplugged without me knowing, these guys could have easily said it was broken and repaired the full thing but no they are honest and only charged me for the labour for the hour it took them to do it! We need more places like this! Thanks guys!<//Text>

They fixed my drone but they gave it to me without the 4 helices. They said that the drone had been delivered. I recommend: when you leave them your drone, take a selfie with the operator and all the parts of your machine. ticket 104667< /Review>

<Name>Taylor Johnson< /Name><Review>My Mavic pro was getting gimbal vibration errors. After hours in the forums trying everything imaginable, I decided to give AerialPixels a try. Stopped by their shop expecting an expensive bill. They took the time to listen to my problem, then powered everything up in front of me to confirm and document everything. I felt extremely relieved, and instantly knew I came to the right place. A quick test flight and Joe instantly knew the problem. Turns out the carbon fiber props were unbalanced. With a new set of props installed the problem was gone! Best of all, the support, advice and the solution took less than 15 minutes and they didn't even charge me! AerialPixels is amazing!

<review>I was out flying my Mavic Pro in the desert and had a rough landing. The gimbal was twisted up and the camera wouldn’t work. Found Aerial Pixels on google and trusted the previous reviews. I came in and met with Joe he was great and told me the gimbal was dirty with some sand and that was it. It was great to hear it was an easy fix and nothing else and Joe was honest about it just being that easy fix. It took 2 days for the whole process. When I picked it up he gave us some tips on how to prevent harsh landings and also told us about his drone class which is something we might do in the future. This is a great spot with trustworthy people I will definitely come back if something else comes up.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Wow, i have to say that aerial pixels has the best customer service of any tech company out there. They repaired my ronin thumbstick controllers in a rush because i had a shoot the following day and even decided to wave the $75 repair fee. So accomodating and friendly. I highly recommend purchasing their products. Well designed and they stand behind their products and are super helpful.<//review>

<review>To their credit, I commend Aerial Pixel for all the positive feedback they are receiving from their customers(only 2 negative). Obviously they are doing something right. I'm aware then, that I'm in the minority when saying  however, that my experience with them wasn't as pleasant.  It seems to me that most, if not all of the positive reviews come from people who's work was done right for them the first time. The problem seems to be when they misdiagnose a problem, such as in my case and also as in Mr. Dru Magtoto's case 5 months ago(one of the 2 negative reviews). The initial diagnosis of my Mavic Pro was for the replacement of the flat ribbon cable($200), which I paid.  When I picked it up, I asked the gentleman if everything were OK. He said he flew it for several minutes and everything looked good.  The first time I flew it up the "unstable gimbal" reading showed on the monitor. I wasn't sure if that was a normal reading, but also thought it may have been because it was windy that day. A couple days later, I decided to try it again and this time the same thing, except another reading which was unusual, plus the gimbal was spinning in different directions. I then called Aerial Pixel and clearly stated to the young lady on the phone that I was having some excessive readouts on my Mavic and I didn't think all of my issues were resolved during the repairs. I also mentioned that I couldn't bring it in right away,  but wanted to make sure that they'd have a record of the problem. She said to just bring it back and they'd take another look at it.  I took it back and several days later, I received their email and the diagnosis was "replace flat ribbon".....again! But this time, the estimate was $185. I called back and told them that they already replaced the flat ribbon. I talked to Joe and he said that it could be something else, which would cost more. I then said "forget it" and I'd come get it, but he then calmly, but firmly reminded me I'd still owe $75 for the second "diagnosis" since it was after 30 days. So that would be $275 for a problem that wasn't fixed? I'm thinking "what about my calling you guys before the 30 days?".  I then told him to go ahead and fix it. On the 3rd diagnosis, the estimate was $275 to replace the gimbal frame. I finally got it back and the total cost was $475.  I flew it today for the first time and still got "unstable gimbal" . I don't know, maybe it's a normal reading. I do know that even if it hasn't been totally fixed and I'm clearly within the new "30 day" time frame, I'm not taking it back. I feel that as a business, they should realize  that they will have some situations where they will have to give extra time and effort(such as in Mr Magtoto's and my case), but in doing so, they would keep those customers. Also, to their credit, they did warn me that I needed new propellers. Seemingly nice people though.<//review>< Name>

<text>Amazing place! I had seen them online before but never thought much of it until I needed urgent help with my drone. A DJI firmware problem that I struggled with for over 7 hours, they were able to fix in under 1 hour. Extremely thankful! I needed to use the drone later that same day and was nervous about how long the repair would take. It was done in no time at all. They really make the most out of the service time you are paying for. I didn't get their names but they were a great pair of guys!<//text>< time>

These guys are great!
My DJI Phantom 3 was not connecting to my RC after I accidentally left my drone powered on when I put it back in its storage case. The battery overheated and fried the receiver module in the drone.
Aerialpixels diagnosed the problem immediately and ordered a new receiver module.
From dropoff to pickup they kept me informed every step of the way with their online repair ticket system. I knew when my drone was being diagnosed, what parts had been ordered and what the price would be.
I didn't pay anything until my drone was 100% fixed and they tested it in front of me.
I am a busy pilot shooting real estate so every day without a drone is lost revenue, I appreciated their knowledge and efficiency...I was flying again less than an hour after I left their store and my repaired drone performed flawlessly!
To top it all off I was running late when I dropped my drone off for repair...I called ahead and they kept the store open just for me. That's great customer service!! I felt well taken care of.< /Review>

Joe provided excellent service when I dropped my Phantom 4 and caused some gimbal damage. He helped me figure out a plan of action that met my needs with as low a cost as possible. He and his lead tech, Kavi, seem extremely knowledgeable about the DJI product line.

I have had a very strange descent problem with my quad that caused a crash from high altitude last year. I always assumed that it was my fault, but Joe spent extra time investigating the issue and he feels strongly that an equipment defect caused the problem because he has never seen as issue like it before. However, because resolving this issue was beyond the scope of services provided by AerialPixels, Joe suggested I contact DJI. Unfortunately, DJI wasn't willing to investigate the issue free of charge. Although my flight logs demonstrate that the issue started occurring during the warranty period, my quad still doesn't qualify for warranty service because I didn't report the issue until the warranty period expired. So, I have an otherwise healthy Phantom 4 with a bizarre descent issue that could come back to bite me sometime.< /review>

After a terrible crash into the trees at a137' that was 100%  pilot error, I was afraid my Mavic was toast.
Got the Mavic back today from Aerialpixels in perfect condition. Just finished 3 hours of testing, including photo's, video, wind and all intelligent flight modes. Everything works perfect.

Thanks for all of your help Joe. Fantastic support & communication.

Customer for life !

Joe helped take my drone flying skills WAY to the #NextLevel and in just 2 hours! Amazing teacher (and pilot!) and aerial tech expert, and takes you from the core basics to all the tips and tricks you could hope to know. SO much I wouldn't have ever figured out on my own even years later, and he adjusts to a pace of schooling that just couldn't be more on point. AND a super cool dude #winWIN with AerialPixels 100! Just after our one lesson I was able to add client drone video captures  to my company services #TheWebStylist AND with confidence! #priceless<//review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>this is a very fair review for aerialpixels Specially to JOE.
i took my p4p for a  rush gimbal repair because i only had 6 days left for my trip to ASIA. i think Joe has a very good customer communication skills and i think he is a well experienced drone pilot.

Let me share you my story why i gave this guy a very Low review. this is not because he didn't completely fix the problem. but because he was charging me $200 for something he missed diagnose.

so i took my p4p for a gimbal repair and he said that he will charge me $75  and he will find out EXACTLY the details of the problem. so i said yes and i was confident that that they will find it out because this is what they do. 5 days later i took a day off from work, went to pick up my drone and he replaced the yaw motor so basically the overloading problem got fixed but the camera was still not centered. after 6 hours of trying to figure out why the camera is not centered they finally gave up. so he told me that if I'm flying my drone don't fly it straight just follow where the camera is pointing so basically SIDE WAYS. i was like REALLY?  so i knew right then and there that he missed diagnose something. so he put the drone  back together and he was charging me $200 for something they did not fix. i told him joe you didnt completely fix the issue of my drone and why am i supposed to pay you that much.

In a repair business if you missed diagnose something you are not supposed to charge  a customer even a single penny.  that is why you are charging a diagnostic Fee to do thorough inspection of the problem and be certain with your diagnostic. why do i know that? because im in a repair business for 9 years.  so i ended up paying him only $160 just to get it over with and just to get my drone back. good thing i found AERIAL MEDIA PROS the next day saturday. after 1hr i got my drone back their diagnosis, failed gimbal so they had to replace the whole gimbal. So Jay the technician didnt even charge me a diagnostic fee after i told him the money i spent on Aerial pixels.

so i called Joe. and asked him if i can at least refund the extra $85 that i paid him. he said you ll not gonna get anything back after after 6 hours i spent on your drone! with a attitude voice". i said you can have the $75 MISSED diagnostic fee that you charged me. but let me just get the extra $85 back that you charged me for something you DID NOT FIX JOE!!!!  very in experienced when it comes to diagnostic and very expensive too..
I'm thinking about of taking this matter to CONSUMER AFFAIRS.

i paid Aerial Media pros:
GIMBAL $700
Labor $50 (thanks to jay)
waiting time 1hr

i paid AERIAL PIXELS
$75 MISSED DIAGNOSTIC FEE
$85 PART AND LABOR( but did not fix the issue)
waiting time 5 days.

so i spent almost a $1000 just to get fixed. lesson learned for me and hope to you guys as well. take care of you P4p gimbals</Review><date>1513548927561< /date>< pictures>

< Review>
First off. Great experience overall. Can't say enough nice things about Joe and Aerialpixels. Joe is an expert repair tech and very knowledgeable overall.

Heres my story. I let an inexperienced friend fly my Mavic, which ended with a broken gimbal mount late in the afternoon. Called the shop the next morning, Joe answered and told me he could have me taken care of same day, and he had the parts in stock. Showed up at the shop, dropped the drone with him. Came back after some errands in the area and it was done. Good value, great service, clean shop.

If you ain't breaking it, you aren't having fun.< /Review>

So I took my tree huggin Mavic in and in about an hour (Sweeeet!) Joe had my camera and gimble running like new with Dji parts.
If you too have a need for speed and a tree jumps out in front of you give Joe a call, he'll take great care of you.</Review>< pictures>

Joe and Kavi were both absolutely amazing and extremely helpful in repairing my drone! I called AerialPixels before they were even open for the day and Kavi answered my call. I brought my drone in that afternoon and Joe made sure I was able to take it home the same day - new gimbal/camera and all!  I would highly recommend them for any needed drone repairs (although I'm hoping for no more crashes)!</Review>

This place is awesome. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. They don't just sell or do repairs, these guys are pilots and they know their stuff in and out. I took in my P4 because I thought I needed a motor replaced. DJI said it would take a month. Other places were doing it in 2 weeks or 2 days with a rush fee, Aerialpixel... over the phone they said 2 days no rush fee. When I got there it took them less than 5 minutes to inspect it and find the issue. It turned out my motors were fine and I had a prop issue. They helped me fix it and checked it out to make sure it was perfect before sending me off in a matter of 15 minutes. They saved me money and time, and I learned more in the few minutes I spent with them than I have scouring the internet for hours. Definitely coming back anytime I need anything drone related.</Text>

People. Stop searching the internet for a credible place to send your broken multi. These guys are the bees knees! I had a relatively bad crash (in tripod mode). Yeah, tripod mode. When I turned the Mavic on, to my disappointment, I got the "overheated main board" warning of death. The fan stopped working. Panicking, I instantly looked for my DJI Refresh care policy number to begin the, what I learned, six month process of dealing with DJI's customer support. Needless to say, I was unhappy just thinking about how much of a headache this is going to be.
Hopeless, I took to the interwebs to find help, I came accross Aerial Pixels. I brought them my Mavic Pro. When I entered, I didn't see anyone but I heard a kind voice from the back, "Hello!" .... as we exchanged greetings, Joe peeked his head up from his workstation. Right away, I liked this place. People actually working is always refreshing. As I walked past the graveyard of busted Phantom's,  Joe begins to tell me that my Mavic looks good and the crash likely caused the cooling fan to stick. Moral of the story, If i was on top of my emails, I would have had my Mavic back in 3 hours. Not 3 months. I picked it up the next day and walked out with a perfect drone and peace of mind.

yeah I bought the DJI Care for $100 and probably will never use it.

After meeting Joe and the team at AP, I can't wait to crash my Mavic Pro again.  These guys do it all
1) Full custom builds
2) Racers
3) Studio rigs
4) ALL DJI
5) Gimbals for DAYS!
6) They can order all parts and accessories quickly
7) They offer 107 training classes for commercial pilots.

Go to Aerial Pixels. No, really, just go.

I went to this shop to drop off my drone after I crashed. They installed a new gimbal assembly on the spot, within 20 min.
These guys are professional and their prices are fair. Im glad I found this place.< /Review>

Thank you Dave! 5 ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Service!!
I just sunk $4,000 into an video editing build PC
for my small Biz Plastic Color Productions The pc would not boot up!! Dave came to the rescue! He had the whole job done in about 2 hours! With a fair price$.I met him at  his drop off zone (parking lot Ximeno and Anaheim) handed off the PC. My wife wasn’t happy about not getting anything in writing. But Dave was good to his word! Honest with great workmenship!

He fixed & updated  the motherboard & turned my wiring mess into a beautiful stylish PC!!
You can trust Dave with your PC builds,fixes,needs!! Dave is my go to for IT needs!

< Review>
The front room was completely empty and he brought me to the back where he was already talking to another customer about working on his computer. I felt like I was in the exam room at the doctor's office while they were already examining a patient for a prostate exam. Contents on computers are very personal and shouldn't be spoken about in front of others. He tried to get hundreds out of me and all it cost me was $50 and a half an hour of my time. But then again I'm sure he wasn't aware that I am an IT professional and have been for over 20 years. I just didn't want to do the job. But I'm certainly not going to be taken for a fool. I would strongly suggest anybody to look elsewhere. I've had Fair to good experiences with quick fix computers on Redondo. If it's a job I don't want to do myself or a customer since I am semi-retired might I mention happily because I own my own Corporation while contracting said IT work for midsize to large corporations and employed many people. If you go here good luck he'll just want to replace instead of doing any Diagnostics. I knew I was in the wrong place when I saw he wasn't wearing a ground when he was touching all the parts inside my computer! And I didn't much care for his attitude when I said I wasn't going to use his service and pay him hundreds of dollars I guess he thinks he always gets a yes.<//Review>

I had issues with my computer, it had trouble recognizing the fans and my Windows was not activated and I came to Dave for help. It was the best choice because not only did he figure out the problem within an hour he also helped me activate Windows and fixed the issue without buying extra hardware. He gave me a discount for being a student in college. Great price, great fix, and overall perfect experience!</review>

Dave is extremely knowledgeable even with an unique program i threw at him for help. He researched and figured out how to install this old ancient program that was a must for my business and trust me it was no easy task. I've gone to him several times for various issues and he's fast, affordable and efficient. Totally recommend!</text>

I called around a couple of places and Dave was the only one to take the time to try and understand my computer issue (it was a screen problem on my laptop). After I brought the computer in, he took it apart right in front of me. Other people tried to have me leave my laptop with them, without cracking it open, so I appreciated Dave's honesty.

He figured out what the problem was in less than 10 minutes, quoted me a price and said the repair would be done in 4 days. He got it done in 3 days. I was super happy and really think he is an honest computer repairman. I will be going back if I need to.< /review>

DYNAMITE DAVE!

I had a fabulous experience with Dave today! I accidentally shattered my laptop screen yesterday and I really need a new computer for some training I'm gonna be doing this weekend. Dave took care of me! He suggested a better computer to buy than I was going to buy.   Then he was able to transfer all of my data from my old computer to the new and he blessed me with extra features that will make my life more manageable! I suggest to anyone who needs help in a pinch to come to DYNAMITE DAVE because he will give you DYNAMITE SERVICE!😊< /Text>

Super Nice Guy!
Took my laptop in for a malfunctioning cooling fan. He gave me an honest estimate of the time and labor for a replacement. Called me back 1 hour later and the fan was fixed. Only charged me for an hour of labor. Great experience and he now has my business!< /text>

<Review>Not sure who 'Bryan Diamond', the illiterate kid who left the previous review was, but Dave has absolutely saved my bacon 3x now! After hours on 1 occasion, and even on a Sunday evening on another! Thank you Dave & Thank God for your patience and care! Edit: I forgot to mention Dave's pug is hilarious! 5 stars isn't enough! Thank you again!</Review>< username>

I recently purchased a new computer and contacted Dave (on a Friday) to transfer the data from my old computer to my new one. Since the transfer was taking longer than expected (and I really needed my computer for my business) he agreed to meet me on a Saturday during his off hours to give the computers back.

Data transfer went as smooth as possible. Thanks for your service and accommodation Dave! I just bought a new comp for my partner, so we are going to come back soon to do the data transfer on her computer.</review>

Normally I can work through problems on my computer, but this time, I needed some professional help! Dave came to the rescue. He was able to immediately back up my data on my external hard drive and I left my computer with him- feeling relieved. Dave works fast! He diagnosed my computer in the morning and had it back to me early in the afternoon.  Desktop is 100% back to normal.

I recently thought I couldn't connect to the internet. Dave told me to bring the laptop in right then (even though it was lunchtime). Within minutes, he determined nothing was wrong...and did NOT charge me for his time. (BTW, resetting resolved the issue.) Dave has always been professional, calmly giving options and waiting patiently for my responses. I would recommend him to anyone who asks, and I will definitely go back.

I found Dave's Computers while I was pumping my gas. I was looking for a computer repair person because Geek Squad said they couldn't help me with my hard ware problem. What a pleasant experience I had with Dave. Not only did he help me right away, he got the job done well! Thank you Dave. I highly recommend Dave for your repairs.</text>

I had an issue today with my PC after I tried to overclock the CPU and after spending many minutes on hold with Fry's Electronics, I decided to try elsewhere.  That's when I found Dave's Computers on Google.  Dave is a true gentleman and a scholar.  Not only was Dave willing to help me over the phone, he was patient with my questions and very clear in his explanations.  His instructions were good enough that I was able to hang up and complete the task of resetting my CMOS to the factory specs on my own.  I would recommend Dave's Computers to anyone.  Thank you, Dave.  If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be on my computer writing this review, right now.<//text>

<Review>Dave treated me with the upmost respect and gave me a free diagnostic. Most computer repair shops charge $20-30 just to look at it and even make you come back a day or two later. I came in and he immediately helped me out in his station in the back of the store.

He saw that I had a lot of dust piled up in my fans and proceeded to take it outside and clean it up. Afterwards, he quickly diagnosed my PC with a bad power supply. He offered a great price on a replacement power supply unit along with labor. Although I ultimately decided to ask my friend for help, I appreciate the effort Dave put into making sure I knew what the problem was and what I need to do to fix it. I enjoyed talking to him. He complimented me on my computer build and gave me a few tips on what I could do to give it a new look. Props to the man, he is very knowledgeable when it comes to PC building.

He also has a very cute dog if you hate computers 🙂< /Review>< Pics>

Dave has always been my go-to man, he's quick, considerate and doesn't make me feel incompetent.  This time I needed help with a laptop that had been bounced - not repairable but everything saved and installed onto my new laptop. His advice and efficiency is always on point.

<text>The owner was very disrespectful and unprofessional twords me, did not solve my computers issue when promised, computer came back to me in worse condition than when i sent it in, now i have to go spend more money to fix my laptop because this shop SCAMMED me of my money.
The only even remotely good thing about this place is his adorable dog "tater"  besides that I would not recommend this place to anyone.</text>< pictures>

If there were any problems - like the computer being worse than when you brought it in -  we would have seen them then. If not, then later if it showed you a problem why didn't you call to complain?  Not even a call to tell me I how dissatisfied you are? Also, any job that is going to take longer than predicted sees me call the customer to tell them why and when I expect to have it done.  Unprofessional? Possibly. I mean I have a dog in the office. How professional is that? Disrespectful? Absolutely not."}< /response>< gmapID>

I had to go on a business trip when my computer broke. The part was going to take 2 days. Dave ordered the part and let me borrow his laptop. He saved the day, and when I got back my computer was fixed! He did not even charge me for borrowing his laptop! I am telling everyone about Dave's Computers!</text>

I had a great experience at Dave's Computers. I dropped off my laptop because my wireless stopped working after a home internet upgrade. His service was fast, affordable, and true to his quote. I had to come back a second time because I did something to mess up the internet settings which caused more problems... He fixed it again free of charge (and didn't make me feel like an idiot). He truly went above and beyond. Go see Dave!<//text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Very transparent. I got there and expected to see somebody and have them write down what I wanted which was to change my hard drive on my Dell Laptop from an HDD to an SSD and add an additional 8 GB of RAM for a total of 16 GB.
The computer is about 3 years old but it did come with Windows Hello and Windows 10 so it is not outdated. It was just really slow compared with my Chromebook and Windows needed to be reinstalled because of all the muck that accumulated over the years.
Anyway, I was very surprised when Dave came out front and invited me back to his bench where everything is neat and tidy. He gave me a great price and my computer was back to me one day after he got the parts delivered.
Boy, what a difference! It's speed is now on par with the Chromebook which is instantaneous. I will not grow old watching the spinning wheel. It boots to full function in less than a minute.
My advise to anybody is to check your hard drive and RAM before you purchase a new machine. A new SSD really makes a difference.
I've done business with other Computer Repair places and they are like car dealers, one price just to walk in the door for an estimate that takes a day itself.
Dave is a personable and a superb technician. I highly recommend Dave's Computers.<//Review><username>Alan Fisher<//username><user_id>101030115344761746161<//user_id><Rating>5</Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dd32002fae6a61:0x92e20529a7720990< /Gmap_id><Date>1529502610739<//Date>< Pics>

Chicken is great, but avoid all sides made of bread.  Biscuits are dry, will completely suck the moisture out of your mouth.  new beignets are the same and tiny, dry and filling is not great.< /Review>

Good food. Just that I had to wait for about 20 minutes past my ready called in order.  The order was missing some items. Had to go back to ask for it. But were very apologetic and fixed it quickly. I went during lunch time. It was busy.<//Review>

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, located in scenic and historical Covina California, features great tasting Louisiana style chicken and fresh made biscuits.
They have a wide variety of side dishes and a great selection of soft drinks and tea.
They have a drive through and inside, the restaurant is sparkling clean with plenty of seats and windows all around .Clean restrooms as well.
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in Covina California has a friendly staff and very helpful.
Family, kid and senior friendly,
It's a great eating experience !< /review>

<time>1607748471671</time><review>Food order took sometime to prepare. Carry out takes a while. Drive thru line is rather long. The taste is uniformed with other popeye's no real variances. The bad part is the cashiers in drive thru and at the counter. Wear the same gloves while taking customers cash, counting coins & credit cards. Then go back and handle the food. Currency and card handling does not mix in these trying times. They did have a hand sanitizer at the door, but it was empty. So it does seem that safety is not a real big issue with their customers. Other than making a profit.< /review></record>

< Review>
I've eaten at some of the chicken places in the Covina-Charter Oak- Glendora area. For the price, amount of food, and service this place ranks last. Overpriced, small portions, chicken was nonexistent, all batter. Service good be better but I bet that there underpaid and from some insane reason the drive thru line has extended into the street.  Maybe I'm missing something here on the menu. I'd eat here before this place. Check the picture and you'll understand</Review>

< review>
I rarely eat at Popeye's and it appears I'll be eating there even less now. My debit card and credit cards got demagnetized earlier this week and the new ones haven't arrived yet. I waited for 15 minutes in the drive-thru to be told they don't have the ability to enter the number manually. I don't know if the corporate higher ups don't want minimum wage employees to take on big tasks like punching in the digits on the card or if the teens of today aren't capable but it's disgraceful! I don't think it's the latter as the young man who helped me seemed up for the challenge and more than capable but when he asked the manager how to enter the numbers, the voice bellowing across the kitchen said, "We can't enter the numbers." Technology can't help this problem. This is a Popeye's issue. On the positive side, my $86 order was wasted as it got made but not paid for. I'd fix this if I owned a Popeye's. It seems like wasting food when people are hungry and customers time while not taking in a penny because of something businesses have been handling seamlessly for decades is a joke but it's not! I'm dead serious. Popeye's can't take demagnetized cards even if they're chipped. Since I know this is a problem I'll likely waste more of my time and place several orders a day using my demagnetized card so Popeye's goes bankrupt while employees eat the wasted food for free.<//review>

This Popeyes, you have to be careful because they will give you the wrong order knowing they are doing it. Like you as for spice and they give you mild. Know you not going to drive always back to get the right order. They have done this several times to me. When I was in there another had came back compliant too. Check your order...even if you have to bite into check before leaving.< /Text>

<Text>First time for this restaurant chain, due to my wife being tele-brain washed into wanting one of the chicken sandwiches they advertise. Went ahead  with her sandwich and also got the $10 deal (6 chicken pieces, two sides and 2 biscuits) and I ordered 6 more biscuits. I love biscuits so I had to do a comparison. Chicken was really good,  the entire family (3 of us) and we all agreed they would be seeing us again. Rated the biscuits as better than the fall apart ones at KFC and almost as good as some made at home with bisquick. We stayed with the mild for our first time,  but the rest of the family opted for the spicy the  next time. The store we visited was the closest to our home, which was about 6 miles away. On a positive note, the Sizzler which was part of our regular family dinning, and went out of business.....is currently slated to become a Popeyes. And it's only one mile from home. What a changing world we live in today.< /Text><rate>4<//rate><user_id>114012062854546637438< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Standard Cajun fast food and offering drive through and delivery during coronavirus. Note that it took 50 minutes of waiting in the drive through line to get our food; there was one smart person who left the line and parked to pick up food. They were able to do that and get their food prior to us placing our order.

They skimped on the Cajun fries, which was disappointing. That being said, I was glad to finally have been able to try the much hyped spicy chicken sandwich. The sandwich is much bigger than the equivalent chickfila sandwich, but the spiciness comes from the sauce rather than the chicken itself. I liked how the chicken was breaded and it was still crunchy even after the 20 minute car ride home. The sauce wasn’t spread evenly though, so I would suggest spreading it out yourself with a knife if you get takeout. The sandwich does come with pickles, and you can get a non-spicy sandwich (although the spicy sandwich is definitely manageable, and in the same level as hot Cheetos).<//text>

<text>Drive-thru is always backed up so I tend to walk inside to order goes a little faster than drive-thru. I find the fried chicken to be tasty especially the spicy option and can't go wrong with the red beans and rice if you like a smoky flavor.. Mmmm good! Biscuits here are better in opinion have nice buttery flaky texture and flavor. Only a few specials are available from what I have seen,  wish they were more because the chicken sandwich just doesn't cut it,  I prefer the chicken pieces with mashed taters,  coleslaw,  red beans and rice and a biscuit. Overall a great place for good fried chicken.<//text>< Pictures>

For the price, amount of food, and service this place ranks last. Overpriced, small portions, chicken was nonexistent, all batter. Service good be better but I bet that there underpaid and from some insane reason the drive thru line has extended into the street.  Maybe I'm missing something here on the menu.

<Text>My order was super simple
One chicken sandwich no mayo,
Came home and the sandwich is flooded in mayo
(I live 5 minutes away)

The sandwich is not even crispy it’s Soggy from all the mayo they put,

15 minutes waiting to order & 15 minutes to get my food, 30 minutes total.

I’m giving this to lady
She’s an Alaskan husky.

THIS LOCATION IS UNABLE TO TAKE A SIMPLE ORDER, DOUBLE CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU LEAVE!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Popeyes is definitely not your average fast food. I love the green beans and mashed potatoes. This particular location however forgot my daughters chicken tender in the kids meal. But i would go there again and probably mention the mishap just so they're aware. The apple pies are better than Mc Donalds too.<//Text>< pictures>

Drive thru line is rather long. The taste is uniformed with other popeye's no real variances. The bad part is the cashiers in drive thru and at the counter. Wear the same gloves while taking customers cash, counting coins & credit cards. Then go back and handle the food. Currency and card handling does not mix in these trying times. They did have a hand sanitizer at the door, but it was empty. So it does seem that safety is not a real big issue with their customers. Other than making a profit.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe6Tv4NY899hDrrdR24hnVhFVW9R6RN37foRWG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiOuRjENDeReH0oMwrP4tSfjJ1OURTSaYpjzYV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO50q3ejjENrMaBMeOnOFXxgC8DfHtklTuEgAkR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODsKG8zgJwnRoJ0rp4sutgoY-unQ-OSLOf1Tv5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVBc_iUsc7UXZ3aWv80CCc13QD7dzQAkdS-IOW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-QG1Hb-wzRNATHx5jwH0TPRNTDMeUxLjxjZFj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBakIDznvN6C7RA0RDVyszAZhy_-Oq_cMe8mRa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE54Lugy1baUMU7JZHM864EIF6g7J17HVS9heU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ6AHLMXFjD5NF22gKVoWa3cCheRq49ciU4L1a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3Py_TWolrllMv5S56Z20aOH2yFAs_Wghls3bc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures></record>

This Popeyes has the worst service in the San Gabriel Valley drive-thru is horribly slow. We have been in and out of lockdowns for over a half of year and the Popeyes in Azusa and La Puente have been able to figure it out but this one makes no effort to expedite service.<//review>

Check your order!
While the quality is acceptable, for the 2nd time recently I was shorted 1 out of two sandwiches.
I was charged for the full order.
After 25 min waiting in the drive through and as a courtesy to those waiting in line behind me,  I fell into the habit of thinking the workers can add 1+1=2 but that is sadly not the case.
If I return, I will be checking to ensure that I am provided all that I pay for.</review>

Today I went to this popeyes after ordering through the app. I go to the door and it’s locked and the lights are off. I knock and finally get the attention of a person who works there and she tells me I have to wait in line. The line at this point is out to the street and wrapped around. I tell her I order ahead and she says “sorry but you have to wait in line. We’re short staffed. “ I ask for my money back and she says they can’t and I have to do it through the app.

This place is a joke. If you want popeyes don’t come to this location.<//text>< Pictures>

We waited in line for about 30 minutes only to be very disappointed! There classic chicken sandwich was mostly coating , very little chicken, and the beans and rice made me sick! Oh and they intentionally blew off our order for apple pies, I guess they take long to warm them, so they just pretended that we never made the order 😕 we will NEVER RETURN!!!!< /text>

<review>The most amazing fried chicken around.  Juicy, delicious, CRUNCHY (not soggy).   If that weren't delicious enough , the biscuits, mashed potatoes and gravy, with Louisiana dirty rice will make you lick your fingers clean.
You have not truly eaten fried chicken until you've had Popeye's Chicken.

<Text>Terrible place. I ordered 16 pieces fried chicken by drive thu. When I went home and opened the box, I found out they only gave me 12 pieces. This is the second time they gave me less chicken then my ordered. And by the way,I was overcharged about five dollars. Just because I forget to get the receipt, I can do nothing. Never go there again!!! If u want to go, best ask for the receipt and count the chicken they give u!</Text><username>Yunzhi Lin< /username>< resp>

Very bad service experience. The cashier was on her phone, told me to park on the side and they will bring the chicken to my car. I waited 20mins nobody come and went inside no one knows there's a order waiting outside. I saw every car behind me got their food.< /Text>

<Review>This is the 4th time after getting home and then checking my order that a item was missing,  i order the #5 platter and one of the 2 sides are missing. I tried calling today 9.11.20 and there's no answer. I want a refund for the missing items or coupons, I'm contacting corp. Monday this has to be addressed. However the workers are working non-stop very fast to fill the long line of customers but a double check would help.

Terrible service! Why hasn't a manager stepped in to retrain after reading all the other bad reviews? I was in in 8/12/2020 at 6:45 PM, picking up a Doordash order I waked in to 6 other people waiting for orders. I stated that who I was picking an order up for doordash and provided the name cashier turn around then stated they are working on it right now. 30 minutes later I was still standing waiting for the order while other online orders got picked up, I canceled the pick up and walked out.

In the past I have had other issues with this location staff does not acknowledge you when you walk in, I always have to say "excuse me" for someone to turn around and say we will be with you shortly mind you they have a order screen behind them but when they look at the screen the act like if your not standing at the counter.<//Text>

The service was fine, the much hyped spicy chicken sandwich was big but just OK!! I really didn't see what the hype was about & definitely would NOT have wait in any long lines!
Actually I thought the strips were better.

The location was reasonably clean.< /review>

<Text>This place is horrible. I pick up orders for door dash here and they are incredibly mismanaged and disorganized. Today I waited in a lobby full of people because their loser manager felt the need to make drive through a priority instead of her overflowing lobby where practicing proper social distancing for the covid 19 pandemic wasn't possible! I highly suggest avoiding this place for any delivery service.< /Text>< date>

Just found out they open a Popeye's near me.  I think they have the best chicken of them all.  Just had a spicy chicken sandwich.  Now I think they also make the best chicken sandwiches.</Review>

My first visit ever to a Popeye's. Good chicken. The breading is different but I actually liked it, it was kind of a surprise though. And the cole slaw was excellent! I'm very finicky about my cole slaw and they do it just the way I like it. Plus I went inside to get the food and kudos kudos kudos to Popeye's for playing authentic music!! I loved it!! I will be back!<//Text>

I've been here twice and I do see that their food is good. The chicken is crispy and moist and this place also had a lot of seats so you can sit down and eat. I had the infamous chicken sandwich in spicy and I will come back again.  It was super crispy and delicious, and i do say it is a better deal than the chick fil a one!<//text>< pics>

Picked up for customer. Busy, but busy doesn’t mean you can do things less well. Bagging was bad, they just chuck everything in the bag, crushed boxes. Bag was not in a fit size, everything was flipping and falling.  Cup holder was very weak, only one lay was provided to carry three large cups.

In the end the order was totally messed up. Wrong chicken, and missing fries.<//Review>

<review>My first time at Popeyes and they were out of the infamous spicy chicken sandwiches. I decided to try their 2 piece combo and although the mashed potatoes was good, the flavor of the chicken failed. I was expecting it to burst with flavor, but it did disappoint a bit... the music gave it an Orleans vibe and the place was clean.< /review>< user_id>

Fast and friendly service here, and the Chicken sandwich is not a hype, It's for real! A nice tender portion of chicken with a crispy tender taste on the outside perfectly cooked every time! Loved it!</Text>

Popeyes is clean and always busy. If you go about 5p.m. expect to wait at least 40 minutes for your order... that's how crowded it  can get. The drive through and the walk ins are packed at that time. The chicken is worth the wait, that is if you're craving a good Fried Chicken. Staff is very friendly and the drive thru has always gotten my order right.</Text>

Food was good but they're mass producing those sandwiches so fast that they barely put any spicy sauce on them. And then they charge 50cents for extra sauce after the fact.  🤦‍♂️<//Text>

Today my 10 year old son and I had the most AMAZING and enjoyable experience at this Citrus location. The staff and management were very friendly, professional and amicable with all the customers inside the restaurant. We’ve eaten at other chicken restaurants before, But never experienced this much Satisfaction. I will highly recommend this location to all our friends and family members. Two Thumbs and 5 Stars PLUS!!😋<//text>

<text>Long wait and cheated on the popcorn shimps for the price they charge, the box should at less fill to the top, but instead its so less that I counted 8 tiny pieces and waited 30 minutes from the time of ordering until receiving the food, not worth the time at all. The chicken sandwich is decent. Staff not mean or friendly, just whatever.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c329af6fa88ce3:0x1274e3c7b6e4df83</Gmap_id>< Date>

Adding on to the previous bad review I made. Been waiting in the drive through for over 30 minutes!! The staff love taking their time and don't care about their jobs or reviews. I'm able to write this review while still in the drive through and there's still two cars waiting for food. Speed it up or hire more people< /text>

Ate in this location for lunch and saw kitchen staff not performing proper hygiene procedures. One staff touched his hat and other one there cellphone and proceeded to handle food. Totally not proper hygiene, also its ridiculous how some staff charge for sauces and others dont, very inconsistent. As I was paying for my sauce someone asked for sauce and they tell him its $.25 gave him his sauce but did not charge him. Very unprofessional and they dont practice good hygiene while handling food. People can get really sick because of this.< /Review>

So, only reason it gets a two is simply because the food is good. Other than that, Emily, you messing up. 4 of the 5 orders were supposed to be platters. Nope, all combos. One was supposed to be spicy, also nope. You guys need to develope a read back system to your customers, or anti up the coin and update your 80's intercom. Please. Had no idea the orders weren't correct because they were never imputed correctly. Also, no receipt. So, you be the judge.<//Review>

The chicken is cooked well. Not dry at all in my experience. Service was quick.</text>

<Review>I really wanted to like this Popeye's as it is close to my house. The good news is that the food is delicious. It is my favorite takeout fried chicken and I really like their unique side dishes. The bad news is that while the people who help you are very nice, they don't seem to be very good at getting your order correct. My wife and I recently ordered the Tuesday special which is one leg and one thigh. We got three of them. When we got home, we found that we had one breast and one wing in all three orders. We wanted dark meat! On previous trips, we have ordered half mild and half spicy and received either all spicy or all mild. This last Tuesday, we went in to get the Tuesday special only to be told that they had temporarily stopped the Tuesday special because they keep running out of chicken. It's  Popeye's, they should never run out of chicken! It seems like poor management and poor training or maybe they just don't care. This is not rocket science! If you work at a chicken restaurant, you should be able to tell the difference between white and dark meat. I hope that they get their act together soon! I'm going to try the one in Glendora and hope it is better!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c329af6fa88ce3:0x1274e3c7b6e4df83< /gmap_id></record>

This is a  very long wait, very slow even for pickup , the door is closed due to pandemic,unlike other stores foods on  tables outside for pickup. You will spend  more than 35 for pickup< /text>

<review>Not sure what has happened to Popeyes, but the quality of their food is just not worth the  price. I bought the 5 piece strips...the beans and rice was very dry (I think to much rice) the chicken fell apart like processed nuggets. Needless to say not worth the $13.22 I paid just to toss 😳</review>< pictures>

This place is horrible  the order was not complete.  The sauces are 25 cents each. I would rather go to a different  popeye's.  And then i had to wait28 min. That is a half hour just to get the first half of the order.< /Text><time>1577492634980<//time>< user>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Went on Tuesday and after waiting in the drive through for almost 30 minutes finally arrived to the menu to order. Only to find out that they stated that they were out of chicken sandwiches again. Didn't these sandwiches just come back a week ago? The General Manager Aracelia couldn't manage her way out of a paper sack. Poorly ran restaurant who could careless about their customers or what their customers think. Change your ways or you will never last in Covina.<//Review>< Pics>

Chicken not fresh made.

This is the Grand Opening of this new location in Covina.  The food here is good.  Crispy chicken, have a spicy option as well.

Service not good at all. Came to the drive thru and had me waiting about 15 min just to place my order. First a lady started my order and out of nowhere she just went quiet for another 5 minutes and another guy started my order all over again. Took about 25 minutes just to finally get my food. As for customer service goes thumbs down 👎 not coming back</text>

My opinion of this place has a bias, because I love the Creole-style cooking that this place prides itself on. It is still fast food, and the price can add up quickly. However, it is worth every penny, if you favor this cooking style. It have been waiting for a couple of decades for the locations in SoCal to take off, and I now live within a couple of miles of TWO OF THEM. 😳😁 It may not be everyone's cool of tea, but it certainly is mine.<//Text>

Normally we receive excellent service and food quality is high. Never disappointed with taste. On this "drive-thru order" occasion, our biscuits were missing from our order!!! We all know that Popeye's Biscuits are critical to a Family Meal Deal, especially after paying over 40 bucks. No Bueno. We called this location from home and let them know....we did not drive back, but received a code for the biscuits and a complimentary meal deal, so at least they tried to correct the deficiency.  Regarding the missing biscuits, we as resourceful Mexicans, used our warmed-up corn tortillas to replace the biscuits. Sure it ain't El Pollo Loco but it's just as delicious.</text>

Consistently terrible service. 1st time the server messed up my order in drive through, didn't apologize because she wanted to see her boyfriend outside. the 2nd time, I ordered over the phone. the manager said anything beyond 20 pieces and you have to make a deposit, I said forget it. Chicken is good but the service is usually awful. Don't get unless there's a deal. Even then, it might not be worth it.< /review>

<text>Today I went the Popeyes in Covina.  I used the drive-thru it wasn't busy there were two cars ahead of me. First the girl asked if i wanted to try their apple pie. I said sure then I ordered my food. I got to the window and the girl hands me food and drinks, than she tell me that the pie will take 7 minutes and if could park.i said sure so I park in the parking lot that is right in front of the drive-thru window. I waited the 7 minutes and than 3 more with no sign anybody coming to my car. I tried waving to the girl at the window didnt look my way. So I started to leave which took 3 more minutes and still nobody come out. So I just left I dont care about the pie or the 1.60 I paid. It's the bad customer service I received.  I always see people joke about Popeyes bad service they have, now I believe it.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c329af6fa88ce3:0x1274e3c7b6e4df83<//gmap_id></record>

I really like Popeye's. I've been to other locations that were on top of it. With special posted in windows so drive-through customers can see. This location is a RIP off. I asked for the specials. "There were none" Crazy. I asked again  then I'm told of a $3.99 special.  I ordered several and requested certain sauces. I  get hone NO SAUCES!! Iwill never go back to this location. Covina expect people to pay full listed prices without offering any deals! Very disappointed Popeye's! I work very hard for my $$ to feed my family.</Review>

Must check the food if you order is to go,some food are missing and they will give different part of chicken not the part you want. The service is so bad.<//text>

I’m rating this place 1 star because the customer service is absolutely horrible. So despite the long line of people trying to order they have only 1 person taking orders despite there being PLENTY of staff on duty.

The wait for the food was extensively long and upon receiving my food I was informed that they have no honey. So I ended up not being able to eat my 2 Biscuits. I was also told that I had to pay for any extra sauce beyond 1. So having $15 worth of food and I still have to pay extra for sauce??????!!! And THEN I had to pay for that sauce on the one register that was open which delayed someone else getting their order taken.

No need to return here.</review>

Had to give it 4 star cause the pickle just wasn't the same as the first one I tasted at the Popeye's in Perris CA.  The pickle makes all the difference in the sandwich.  I'll post and add pic when I visit again.</Review>

Food is Amazing But the service is Bad. Giving attitude when asking for small items. Need some tightening up their customer service
Also almost 10 ppl working but only 1 on the counter. Bad management< /text>

First time going to this location and i waited in the drive through line for 30 freaking minutes!!!!!

I bought mcdonalds next door for my 5 year old and had it in the car waiting while i decided to go to this popeyes location for the first time. .

Horrible customer service. Their only excuse to me for the incovinenece was that 'they're sorry they're just really busy....'..like, what?

My kid just finished his entire meal we got at mcdonalds, a hamburger, fries and nuggets....before we could ever get up to the window to even pay!!!!!

No discount offerings or any hospitality?

Screw it we drove right through and left the stupid place. Unpaid for.... especially after realizing how expensive it was there too....ugh

Dont go here, worse location ever.</review>

<review>WORST SERVICE EVER!! I WAITED 30 Minutes IN THE DRIVE THRU only for them to tell me it was cash only and waited more than 40 minutes inside for my order. Workers work slow as if they don’t have 20 orders to accomplish. If I could give 0 stars, I would!!!!!!!!!!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>We've visited this location twice. It's worth the time to drive to the Pomona location instead because this location it terrrrible. Their chicken is jus sub par. Order mild and you'll end up with spicey hard chicken. I gave them a second chance after a lack luster first impression but after sitting in the drive through for 15 minutes to simply come home to hard spicey chicken after I ordered mild. Never again. Go to Pomoma, they're perfect.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Went to see what all the fuss was about.  Had blackened tenders, not bad. With mushy funny tasting green beans and a hard tiny biscuit. Over 10 bux. I came, I tried, I pass.< /Text>

<review>Me & my family waited in their drive thru for over 10 minutes just to be told there was no more chicken and it was only 10:48pm if a business is open until 11pm then all items should still be available as well the manager ARACELY had a bad attitude and seem not to care about customer satisfaction I WILL NEVER VISIT HERE AGAIN< /review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Very slow and confusing service.
Additionally, none of the workers are using masks or face protection, even the workers that handle the food. They breath over and talk over the food while packing it!< /review>

The issue here is not Popeye's... It's this specific location. It's so disorganized, it can take 30-40 minutes from walking in, to actually eating.<//text>

Unfortunately I had a very bad experience, the chucked tasted old and the Coleslaw spoil, I had to return the food, I got no apology from the manager, but clearly food wasn't fresh, such bad thing it was my first time at this location and I don't think I will be back<//text>
