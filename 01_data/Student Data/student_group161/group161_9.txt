A great stop on our road trip. Yes, it's just a gas station, but they have several options for hot food. They even have showers and laundry on-site; how cool is that?! The store was also very clean and brightly lit.</review>

<name>Ravi Kajle<//name><userid>102730704154718950380< /userid><text>They used to be very good on the customer service. Been going there since I believe Sep 2020. But now I think they are getting too much business that their customer service went from 100 to 10. I went in today, got fuel then went ahead and ordered my food and confirmed with the guy that if it would be ready by the time I go take shower. And he assured me that it would be. So I was like please give me a shower, he scanned my am best card, used the shower credit and had me wait for the key for about 20 minutes and finally another guy asked me if I needed help then the guy who had me wait, just pushed a switch and said shower 1 is open now. I mean why couldn’t you just do that 20 minutes ago. But anyway after I took shower and came back asked for my order, he was like let me check and never told me anything about that for another 5 minutes when I asked again then he asked the kitchen and told me to wait 20 more minutes. That’s when I had already spent an hour there waiting for shower and food all together. And I explained that I have to make a delivery then he offered me to cancel the order but not trying to expedite the order. And forgot to mention I could have had stopped in Bakersfield at another Indian restaurant at truck stop but because they were always nice and the owner told me last time that they are going to open restaurant, I thought I would try them. But I guess that was what I got for driving straight to them from Vegas not eating on the way. Thank God they have Subway there. Very disappointed. I hope no one else gets that treatment< /text><gmap_id>0x8094d996e755447d:0xb417d8c7ebb7e379</gmap_id>< resp>

Nice small clean place. Only been open since 9/2020. Parking for 20 trucks but you all know we squeeze more than that in here.  Truck was and mechanic shop on premises.  Laundry, subway and Chesters.  No Transflo services or drop box.   Good coffee and Indian food as well . Great alternative to the major chains .</Text>

This truck stop is by far better than its commercial competitors.   The food is amazingly delicious, the prices were very affordable,  the service was fantastic, the restrooms are clean, the store was clean.  There's plenty of spacious parking for big rigs on asphalt,  plenty of fueling islands, and there's even a Cat Scale on-site.   This is the BEST truck stop off of CA-99 from Bakersfield to Sacramento !!!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TRUCK STOP !!!
Keep up the good work !!!  👏 👍 💪</text>

Only 4 stars unfortunately as the on-site truck wash have a lot to learn
Washed my truck today, the machines are too powerful and tore off my paint on my front bumper ( picture attached )
The manager of the wash simply denied it and accused me of lying
I then showed him the remnants of my paint flakes on the floor and he then  just walked off ?!?

If you have a newer truck don’t wash it here! They will just clean the paint right off it & then deny it ever happened?!?< /text><name>Hardev Gill<//name></record></dataset><record>

I want to start off by saying I would give this 10/10 stars if possible. This one of the nicest truck stops I ever stopped at. It has it all from clean bathrooms and excellent customer service. They have all the snacks you can crave for and also they are going to have hot deli and pizza as well in the near future.</Text>

They just opened. I went in today for water and some gas, and the person running the place was talking about how they literally started selling supplies inside as of today (28th of August). Because of which it is obviously very clean. It's also super large and very well stocked. Should soon have a Starbucks, Subway, and some pizza place.

Oh and the people there were very friendly, which was nice.<//Review>

They've just opened up (August 2020), really nice and clean store, friendly staff. Showers were still in the process of being done, but were ok. Parking lot for Semi-Trucks is small, about 15-20 spots. Truck wash on site ($75 for truck and trailer), plus a shop for minor repairs. Will stop again< /Text>

They are rude. No greeting when I came to pay, and he threw the change into my hand as he turned to talk to others in his language.. Who knows. No smile, no thank you.. Drivers roll on.</text>

I stopped to get a coffee no coffee was made I asked the attendant if they had any decaf coffee he just said no instead of offering to make some good place to use the restroom but that’s about it items were not even marked with prices I guess you’ll find out at the register how much something is.I won’t be coming back to this truckstop< /Review>

The two barbers in the last two seats on the far right side are great. I believe one is Khaliff, not sure about the other. No complaint on them.

The female, usually cuts and sits behind the desk is very rude. I believe she might be the owner or part owner. She isnt welcoming at all. If I ever do come back, it will be my last resort and will be an appointment with one of those two barbers.< /text>

Stacy is very talented and was very patient with my son considering the type of cut i wanted for my boy. I've also gone to lupe who is just as great. Since moving here we have had a great experience and will continue to go them.<//Review>

Walked in around 2:10pm for my sons haircut right on the door says 3pm closing time... keep in mind on their door right under the Hours says WALKS IN WELCOME DURING BUSINESS HOURS ! As soon as we put a foot thru the door one of the barbers says sorry we’re about to close. Why would you even bother to keep the door open if your going to refuse service to anyone that walks in 50 min prior to you being scheduled to close. Was my first time trying out this place but won’t bother to ever coming back again.<//review>

The owner of this barber shop is so ridiculously rude! I will NEVER go back to this place nor will I ever recommend it to anyone. I use to only bring my son here for his hair cuts, but after my encounter with this woman today  I'm sad to say I'll never return.</Text>

<text>They do a good job cutting your hair but the wait time is horrific, but if you do still want to go, I recommend the barber named Damien, he's there only on the weekends though</text>< pics>

A return visit from Arizona and we still love this little place. I had the Bibimbap and my wife had a Flounder soup, both were great. There's a good reason Wonju has been in Monterey for 27 years.< /review>

It is expensive, that much is true. But the food is incredibly delicious, it is certainly authentic, and the owners are very kind and gracious. The lady may seem "blunt and rude" but that's just a cultural difference. She's actually really nice if you get to know her.<//Review>

<review>Came here for a family dinner. The place is small and simple. Warm,  friendly owners. Felt like they had invited us into their home for dinner. We travel a lot and have been stationed in Korea. The food was really good. Fresh, well made. Many small plates for sharing and tasting. This will be a place we come back to every time we are in the area. Thank you so much for not just a wonderful meal but a wonderful experience.</review>< Pics>

Excellent food, very friendly staff, however overpriced and small portions. It was just my girlfriend and I in the restaurant with no music playing making it very quiet and a slightly weird environment to eat. The food was served on sizzling plates, with a plethora of side dishes which were all delectable.

Ordered: Bulgogi, and Bibimbap<//text>

We were amazed by what was served - tasty and freshly made Korean dishes. The two entrees were served with rice and 10 different small side dishes such as homemade kimchi. Everything tingled our taste buds! Although the restaurant is a bit pricey, the fresh meals and the variety of different tastes were more than worth the visit. Come here if you want to try authentic Korean cuisine in a small, personal atmosphere.</Text><name>Florian M.</name>< GmapID>

Pleasant owner and authentic Korean fare. A bit pricey, but in line with other restaurants in the area, and in my opinion it is worth it. I had the Dalk Tori T'ang - spicy chicken stew. Really enjoyed it, and the many side dishes were also tasty and plentiful.< /text>

<Review>Got married in Monterey and Hubby wanted to try Korean food. The owners were very welcoming and food was great! I hope you like spicy because the Ramen was awesome. The portion sizes are bigger than the average size so if it’s your first time then you might wanna share with somebody. I highly recommend the dumpling soup if you’re not into spicy. It’s a small joint but they put love in their food. We’ll be coming again next time we visit Monterey!< /Review>< UserId.>

I ate here every Sunday for a couple years. Yes, it's not Manchu-Wok cheap, but I've NEVER left hungry whatsoever. I've tried most dishes and they were all fantastic. Try the ribs for lunch or since kimchi stew. Save space for the donuts< /review>

<text>Food is fine, but it’s wayyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced.  Ramen was $26.. Bibimbap $27 dollars.. and It only goes up from there.. prices are about double what they should be.  It’s disappointing, because the food quality was quite good.  Also, the menu is quite limited.  Lower the price, and add to the menu and this restaurant will be successful.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

1 Kim chi soup, 1 Bulgogi & 1 glass noddles for $80?

This is incredibly expensive and the worst restaurant I’ve ever been in California. The dishes are overpriced and the staffs were really rude to customers. We as customers have the rights to order the number of dishes we want to and they said that we have to order a certain number of dishes to get the “refilling side dishes”. This is unreasonable!  And One small bulgogi cost $26? Their food not even worth the price. We regretted not seeing the review before go to this restaurant. Please do not go to this restaurant< /Review>

I had the hot pot dish and asked them to replace the beef with Tofu. The owner also gave me a potato pancake side dish. The service was fast, the staff friendly. It is a bit pricey but after all it's in Monterey, so it's reasonable.<//Review>

The lady boss was blant and rude. Ordered 2 sets + 1 a la carte for 5 pax. Was told no refill at all unless you order each 1 set.  Otherwise refill will be charged. Will never go again. Please avoid this place. It's a shame to have such place in beautiful Monterey. A straight rip off !< /Review>< Resp>

If you're desperate for Korean food then by all means go to this place and it'll get you by.  But don't expect this place to blow you out of the water for Korean food experience. Kimchi was so sour it belongs in the liquor cabinet.  Bibimbop was sour and sweet.  And it literally had bon-chan mixed in rather than the traditional mix of spinach, bean sprouts, fern, etc.  It was a disappointment.  The $50 galbi was 70% bones and ended up being about $4 per piece.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by Oakland, but I've had better Korean in Chicago suburbs than this place.</text>

11-22-2015, Wow this place is GREAT, the owners are super nice and the food very tasty.  We had the Beef Kalbi and Daeji Bulugogi.  Both meat dishes were done to perfection.  If you like hot food be sure to tell them, they will put the real Korean heat to it, otherwise its going to be a nice medium hot for most novices. Sides were numerous and the kimchi full of tangy fermented goodness. The leek potato pancakes are lovely. But the homemade Korean donuts warmly rolled in sugar, were too wonderful to resist!  Prices compare to any other Korean BBQ in south San Jose and the friendly owners were definitely a bonus you don't find often. Can't wait to go back!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) I was able to meet delicious Korean food in 5 months of my visit to the United States. I ate Cheonggukjang and spicy grilled meat, but also gave a pajeon service. Above all, it was good for the children to eat well.
It was only take out (or to go) with COVID-19, but the packaging was meticulous. I could feel the affection of Korea ^^
(I went back to the thank you box later and returned the spoon)

미국 방문 5개월만에 맛있는 한식을 만날 수 있었습니다. 청국장과 생성구이를 먹었는데, 파전 서비스도 주셨습니다. 무엇보다 아이들이 잘 먹어서 좋았습니다.
COVID-19로 take out (or to go)만 되었는데, 꼼꼼히 포장해주시고 마침 일회용 수저가 없어서 수저까지 그냥 주셨습니다. 한국의 정을 느낄 수 있었어요 ^^
(감사함에 나중에 다시가서 수저 반납했습니다 ㅋㅋ)< /text>

(Translated by Google) As a Korean, I am a bit disappointed and regretful ^^ The president wants to improve and improve it, so I leave a review ㅠㅠ First of all, because it is a covid, I haven't been keeping the business hours, so I waited for a long time. It's the same, the ribs cost over 40 dollars ^^ The children ordered two galbi killer, but they said it wasn't good ㅜㅜ I was also surprised by the taste of the ribs I tried for the first time. I think other menus will be delicious. Jeon and pickled side dishes served as a service are okay. But the price of ribs seems to be a bit severe.

<review>(Translated by Google) Too expensive, worst taste & unnecessarily spicy

Kimchi stew is said to be spicy, but this restaurant is more spicy than necessary. Does the original stew need to be so spicy?
There is nothing in kimchi stew other than tofu, even a piece of pork, onion, or ham...

Even in the United States, I couldn't understand foods that were less than 10,000 won in Korea for more than $20. Even so, I had to eat spicy food with a too small bowl, so I added a bowl of rice...5 dollars...ㅜㅜ

I had a deep regret that I would rather go to a Chinese restaurant.
Especially for Korean tourists, it is recommended not to go.
It's expensive, but it's too expensive, it's too much compared to the Koreatown restaurant I ate in LA..

Too expensive,  worst taste &  unnecessarily spicy

김치찌개가 맵다고 하지만 이 식당은 필요이상으로 맵다.원래 찌개가 그렇게 매울 필요가 있을까 ?싶고,(볶음이라면 몰라도..)
김치찌개는 두부외에 들어간게 없다.하다못해 돼지고기 한조각,양파 ,햄 한조각이라도...

한국에서 1만원미만의 음식을 아무리 미국이라도 20불이상은 이해가 잘 안됬다.그건 그렇다 쳐도너무 작은 밥그릇으로  매운음식을 먹어야해서 밥한그릇 더시켰더니..5불...ㅜㅜ

차라리 중식당을 갈껄하는 깊은 후회를 했다.
특히 한국 관광객이라면 안가시길 추천합니다.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Strongly shine. The worst Korean restaurant in the world. If you look at the blog review, they do well for the lunch menu, but they all sound like dogs. If you order lunch, it is annoying and induces you to order it. It is absurd to see food coming out. A ridiculous price plus tips. There is no customer and there is no business, but a teammate asks for a day and pulls it out. Taste is not worth the evaluation. Sitting next to you, how much is a Korean woman abusing her. People who gave a low rating on Google also cursed. It's just a gourmet mindset for Korean tourist attractions in the 7,80s. Mindful Gyopo Mind. Fill up with a three-and-a-three cup ramen in Galvan and go to a Korean restaurant in a nearby metropolis. It's 100 times better than anywhere. Thanks to the unpleasant experience here, I can't even remember the beauty of Monterey.

강하게 비추. 미국 여행 다닌 식당 중 한식 양식 통틀어 단연 최악. 블로그 리뷰 보면 점심메뉴 잘해주고 어쩌고 하는데 다 개소리. 런치 시킬라면 짜증내면서 정식으로 시키길 유도. 음식나오고 보면 어이없음. 팁까지 더해서 말도 안되는 가격. 손님 하나없고 장사도 안되던데 한팀 물어 하루치 다 뽑아내려는 심뽀. 맛은 평가라는걸 할 가치도 없음. 옆에 앉아 한국 여자 아줌마 욕은 얼마나 하는지. 구글 평가도 별점 낮게 준사람들 욕함. 딱 7,80년대 한국 관광지 바가지 영업 마인드. 쌍팔년대 교포 마인드. 여기 갈바엔 삼시세끼 컵라면으로 때우고 인근 대도시 한식당 아무데나 가길. 어딜가나 여기보단 백배 낫다. 여기서 불쾌한 경험 덕에 몬터레이의 아름다움 하나도 기억안남.<//Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It's not delicious, it's gourd
One extra rice is $ 5, and some spicy kimchi crabs with a few pieces of kimchi and three pieces of tofu
Fried rice is salty and the price is more than four times the price of Chinese restaurant
Never go Korean

맛없고 바가지,별점 하나도 아까움
밥 하나 추가에 5달러 , 김치 몇조각과 두부 세조각 든 엄청 매운 김치찌게가 25불이 넘는다니
볶음밥은 짜고 가격은 중식당의 4배가 넘으니
한국분이면 절대 가지 마세요<//Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I ordered bibimbap and kimchi jjige, but the kimchi jjige was a bit of a waste of money (about 7-8 dollars, but I got 20 dollars) and the bibimbap was better. Still, it was nice to see that there is a Korean restaurant in Monterey, but... the taste is so... and the price is a bit expensive. If you're going to miss a Korean restaurant, food like bulgogi would be better than stew.
Seems to.

비빔밥과 김치찌게를 시켰는데 김치찌게는 솔직히 돈이 좀 아까웠고 (7~8불 수준인데 20불 받음) 비빔밥이 좀 나았습니다. 그래도 몬트레이에서 한국식당이 있다는 자체는 반가웠는데....맛은 그닥...그리고 값은 약간 비싼편. 한국식당이 그리워서 가시는 거라면 찌게류보다는 불고기 같은 음식이 나을
것 같습니다.<//Review>

<Review>These guys have great customer service.  Do not hesitate to call them.  They will help you go over diagnostic information to help you get that TIPM repaired.  Their service is top notch.  My Ram 1500 needed a new fuel relay and the replacement TIPM shipped quickly.  I ended up with a lighting issue after that.  They helped me with diagnostic to fix the lighting issue, and under warranty shipped my TIPM back to have it checked out.  Upon discovering my TIPM was for the incorrect model vehicle, they made it right.  They shipped a replacement over night to me, and now my truck running great.</Review>< Pics>

But I'll tell you this when your unit fails, and you have to get it replaced, this is the place you've got to come to and thank God for that. They do good business, they will care more about helping you than they will about selling you something. And that says something about the ethics of this business. Their quality is above and beyond the OEM parts that I originally had installed in my car. I wish this place did a lot more than just TIPM units because I'd shop with them for everything.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Probably the most helpful customer service I have ever experienced. Allowed me to fix my truck flawlessly on the first try. Installation video is extremely helpful. I would absolutely recommend Maks over any dealer or auto parts store. 110% satisfied< /Review>

< Review>
Excellent value and decent turn around time for TIPM repair.   My Dodge Ram had no low beam headlamps, no reverse lights, and an issue with the radio.   Got my TIPM back, followed the soft reset instructions and everything is fixed and working like it should.  I saved more than $1000 by having Mak's repair my TIPM and doing the removal/install myself instead of having the dealership replace the TIPM.   I highly recommend Mak's!  My only issue was with a mail delay getting my TIPM back, but that is on USPS not Mak's.  I had another vehicle to use in the mean time, but if I didn't I would've been without a vehicle for almost 3 weeks.</Review>

Product shipped as promised, Price was as advertised. Great experience. I will definitely use them again. We have a fleet of 14 trucks.

My mechanic installed and we had to reprogram the unit. Works great, not a problem at all.</Text>

The quality of there rebuilds seems to be very good. They were on time with delivery and the parts were a perfect fit. They also provide excellent installation guides.</Text>

<review>Mak is the man!  My 2012 Jeep Patriot had some crazy electrical issues and only about half of the lights worked (headlights, brakes, signals, fogs).  I tried normal fixes and it was the TIPM.  Job looks scary, but Mak does a great job laying it out in his videos and it’s super simple. I even called on a Sunday afternoon and received some help diagnosing.  Cannot recommend enough.  Great service!<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1621973966517, 'text': 'We are delighted to hear that you had a great experience with us and that we were able to help you out!

It fixed the issue I was having (didn't want to start when cold out).

All of this happened within 3 months of install.  We had sent our core back and NEVER rec'd our core charge back.  We've reached out numerous times about the issues and having to have a shop put in a new TIPM and we just keep hearing we'll get your core refunded and some extra for the trouble.

<Review>I was having issues with my Jeep Wrangler. The heating and air vents were not blowing strong and cutting in an out. My door locks didn’t lock with the remote or from inside the vehicle. A mechanic told me it was the PCM and that did not work after replacing. I heard of jeeps having issues with the TIPM and thought i’d try that before spending a fortune at the dealership. It took no longer than 15 minutes for my boyfriend to install the rebuilt TIPM. It was simple and easy to install and it fixed my issues. I highly recommend this company!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I was having some electrical issues on my Jeep and I found these guys on YouTube. I ordered the replacement part and initially had a compatibility issue with it but they immediately picked up when I called customer service and they sent me a new part no questions asked. I would definitely recommend this business.</Review>

This company is very unresponsive. They sent me a faulty tipm unit and I requested assistance they didn't reply to my email for over a week so I had to call to get in touch with anyone. it was also not a plug-and-play as described. I had to modify wiring several times to get things to work. After modifying the wiring I found that the tipm was faulty and had a new one sent under warranty. After receiving the new one I found I had to put all the wiring back and damaged the connector in the process. I asked for them to send me one as a Goodwill gesture for their incompetence and sending me the incorrect part and have still not received a response.<//review>

I'm so grateful to have found this place when I did. TIPM went out on my 2014 jku and I wasn't in a good place to get it from a dealer. Ordered the rebuilt and choose to wait 2 weeks for it. Even coming from Cali all the way to the East coast it got here sooner, and the install video came in clutch! They saved me $1,000-$1,400 and I will 100% buy another one if this one ever craps out on me. I recommend to anyone looking to replace their TIPM</Text>

Unit came well packaged,  with clear instructions.
My 2010 Dodge Journey  is now running and behaving as it should. On a side note,the hood switch needs to  be programmed in order for the factory remote start feature to work again. I'm hoping as the weather heats up I will truly know if this unit has cured the issue. My cars dash gauges would all stop working, the wipers stuck on ,ac not functioning correctly. This would occur almost daily  in Summer, but occasionally anytime it would reappear. I know electronics tend to fail more often when hot,so im hoping for the best outcome. For cars with remote battery locations like my Dodge, the Hard reset required a slightly different process ,but was still very easy. This would be helpful to add to the instructions. Thanks Maks for the quick service and value.< /Review>

The vendor offered a rebuilt guaranteed TIPM for a 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited without the core charge you see in most sales.  It was a easy transaction in that regard and shipping time was reasonable given it was being delivered from California to Alabama.<//review>

Typical for the Dodge family!! Experienced Loss of High beam, fog lights, horn, blinkers, brake lights, wipers, and window sprayer. I had replaced all sensors, PCM, battery, re-wires parts of the truck, replaced all fuses, changed out the multi-switch in the column, and been to the dealership multiple times, and it was weird, as it would happen on and of in different situations and sometimes only show the left "brake light out" light on dash. Then I stumbled onto one of the TIPM removal/replacement  videos that was done by Maks TIPM  on YouTube with some explanations and checked them out. I had EXCELENT!!! service from the start via email with Manuel and was provided quick responses with every email sent.  I followed the instructions online, in the installation video, and in the box and was impressed on how easy the process was from start to sending in the CORE. 3 weeks later I've saved about $1,100 and have noted improvements throughout the whole vehicle electronically. Thanks !!!< /Review>

Update: 08/25/20. I was contacted by the guys from Mak's
today. Very nice , professional, and courteous. Gave me some
great automotive advice on how to solve this kind of problem
on my own next time and wasn't even upset that I wanted to
return the part. Guaranteed my refund without a hassle.
NOW THAT'S GOOD BUSINESS!!!

Bought a TIPM for my 2011 Dodge Ram. I followed the instructions and it did not work. Tried this twice and NOTHING!!! I finally took it to a shop I trust to get it programed and they couldn't get it to work either. I'll be calling Mak's on Monday.......Stay tuned for an update.<//text>

{'time': 1597078872476, 'text': "Fred, sorry for the trouble.  Absolutely call us Monday.  We are ready to ship you a replacement under warranty.   We should also discuss the symptoms so we can be sure there isn't something else underlying the TIPM conflict with your truck.   Although not common, sometimes certain parts change-outs done since the truck left the factory can create a synchronization conflict with a fresh TIPM.  It will be helpful to have your VIN# handy when you call.   Together we'll get to the bottom of it."}<//Resp>

Dont waste your time,go to the dealership,they quoted me $600 and change for a brand new one,live and learn i guess. This place is a joke! Mike Stander Bellevue ne I gave it 1star cuz option for 0 stars was not up there</review>< pics>

Upon receiving the used TIPM, I noticed that one locking pin was broken, another completely broken off, so I was skeptical. I installed the TIPM as directed including the critical 12 second wait, and voila! Truck has been running great ever since. Fast delivery and comes with something others don't, a warranty AND customer service. A+</Review>

My car was possessed. Seriously. Battery kept draining for no reason. Stalling at idle. Horn honking on its own at any given moment of the day or night. Radio changing channels because the radio wanted to. Possessed. I replaced parts and did checks and diagnosis to find the reasons why. Got no where. Came across a link about TIPM's and it seemed to fit my problems.

I did not want to pay the $1200+ for a new replacement fuse box and motherboard so I searched for a good remanufactured replacement. MAK'S seemed to have the best reviews with the best warranty and the best prices.

So I purchased, received timely (within 3-days!) and I installed the TIPM.

OMG.

My car is back to normal. Seriously. The TIMP fixed a multitude of issues I was having that I could not repair on my own.

Total recommend MAK'S TIMP Rebuilders.</text>

{'time': 1597081137129, 'text': "Joe - Sorry for the trouble you experienced.   We have witnessed that there are some inherent vulnerabilities in the Chrysler TIPM design that can cause a TIPM circuit board to burn.   While rare, we occasionally receive repair requests and customer cores that show a burned up circuit board when the TIPM arrives here.    Clearly there is circuitry in the OEM unit design that is vulnerable to other conditions in the vehicle.   I believe once in our history a prospective customer came to us and relayed how his factory unit actually caused a fire under the hood and we were able to help him with a TIPM, harness plugs, and guidance to fully restore his vehicle.   Since this happened on a TIPM after you bought it from us, we too are concerned that it happened under our watch.    We'd like to know the extent of the damage and help you if possible.   Please call us at 818-798-5558.  Ask for Jeff."}< /Response>

So, when our first shipped TIPM you sent back got here, we thoroughly re-tested it.  To our dismay, guess what?  It tested fine and started our vehicle right up!   Frustrating for everybody, to say the least.   It would almost have been better if we found a flaw so we could understand why it didn't work in your customer's vehicle.   So, we think one of two possibilities.  When you installed it, perhaps one the harness connector plugs simply didn't fully seat (those levers can sometimes slip).   This happens during fresh installs more often than one might think.   But as an experienced mechanic I have no doubt you double-checked the connections.   So, one other possibility, and we have seen this on the '09 - '10 Dodge Journey a few times, is that perhaps at some point in the life of the vehicle, a dealer had swapped out the WIN module / Ignition switch and re flashed the original, introducing firmware revision-level conflicts in our first TIPM, that might have been resolved with a later-revision TIPM we shipped the second time. Whatever the case, this just underscores the complexities so many people experience with TIPMs.\n\nIn any event, we are glad resolution was found, and we hope you will still consider working with us when you need a future TIPM for a customer.  And as mechanic, also realize you are entitled to discounts on TIPMs that you should certainly take advantage of if there'll be a next time.   If and whenever the time is right, give us a call and we can get you set up on that program."}<//Resp><text>The item was defective and unable to operate for my needs, I have requested a return which I did get to exchange for another item, but its set be back weeks on that customer.</text>< UserId.>

Purchased a TIPM for my 2011 ram. Ran into some issues that were an inconvenience, but their customer service department took care of me.<//Review>

The one thing that would help customers when they order parts to be shipped is a tracking number so you know where the part(s) are.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I found this place online as they had very affordable rates.  On my way to the place, I checked out two other facilities nearby (Including another location of A-American).  This place had very competitive pricing.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was also a very clean and well-run facility.  The front desk staff helped me through the sign-up process and gave me additional discounts for signing up 12 months in advance.  I even got some free bubble wrap!  I would highly recommend this facility.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUxHeR_v2nRvAd38EY6wNWshT7GWxbHGZkaCjM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCkoR77Q52bDpfcTijZ0BRdwpkfoizB6eqPR72=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1583086714359, 'text': 'Thanks for the detailed review Paul - we appreciate the feedback!'}</response><GmapID>0x80c25a668a491b09:0x605e5896d19d8800</GmapID></record>

I’ve utilized this storage facility on 2 several occasions and have always been treated with respect and awesome professionalism. And the facility is always clean 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I only have one issue which I hope will be changed from the corporate level; that is to have access after 8pm as well as Sundays, and holidays.< /review>

<Review>I have had a storage here for maybe 6 years. I have to say, I am very impressed with this facility.  I am that person that will search for the best price, but is very picky about cleanliness and security.  Not only is this place reasonable and  clean.  Through the years,  If I could give 10 stars everyday, It would be for their customer service.

This is not the reason i wanted to leave a review.
I think We all feel that customer service is the most important wherever we go.
Paola I believe is the Manager here...she has been the one whom I usually speak with.

I have had some hardships in the past, I had moved to another state and have been late several , several times...Paola has always been profession, respectful and has always made me feel like she really cares.

Thank you Paola for your great customer service and for caring.

I have been ill and off work and called them up because I didn't want to lose my belongings but my account had some accrued late fees. Well I called them up explained my situation to Paola and she was so kind and understanding and she went the extra mile and actually waived my late fees. I never expected such genuine kindness from a business. Thank you so much for being human first and a business second. I definitely recommend this business to everyone as all storage businesses are not alike!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>This storage facility is the best one I've been to in the AV. They have very affordable and reasonable prices. Their new lighting makes the place look safer and brighter. The staff is always friendly and always looks out for the well being of their customers. They have a move in special that comes with a free moving truck. If you're looking for an affordable,safe and friendly storage facility, this is the place to be. No questions asked.<//Text>< user>

<review>This use to be a good place. Until someone did not put his cigarette out and half of the building burned. My half of the building did not burn (thank God), but everything is all black with soot. The manager did not call me when it happened. I found out 16 days afterwards. They had my daughter's phone number & they could have called her, right? But they didn't. Now I have big Expense of hiring a company to help me get stuff out & to take pictures. Plus I will move my stuff to another place. Not A-American Self Storage in any town.</review>< Resp>

This place is horrible!!! Do not waste your money here. After their fire they "claimed" I could get my stuff cleaned. It's been three months and still haven't heard anything. The fire was not my fault and now all my stuff has smoke damage and there's nothing I can do.<//text>

I like this storage facility for a multitude of reasons:

1. Climate controlled building for those fragile music instrum...ents...
2. Security
3. Friendly staff
4. Reasonable prices
5. Easy to get to
6. Large access, so I can go there with my RV without any problem
7. Long hours (for comparison my Ventura storage closed at 6PM, while A-American closes at 8PM).

It's a no brainer, this is the place to be.

Note: Add more electrical outlets in the hallways and you will get a 5 star rating from me.</text>

Had a space left it.watched as a group from management played their drums in a unit and tried to get into other units . They left trash and watched every move I made with my belongings, didn't feel safe at all. No real adults in charge at anytime .< /review>

<Review>These guys did a top notch job getting everything done especially in the heat! Serge, Amik , and Mike really knew what they were doing; they even helped get my couch up even though it was a pretty narrow space. I appreciate their hard work- great job Movers of Sacramento!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMU1RqXZbrKBACrAmJ6yvhRxGpWB-z0rcwXz8Qe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Great company. Highly recommended! Scheduled me on a short notice just couple of days before the move. Moved 1,200 2-bedroom in less than 6 hours. I had most my stuff packed already so it was easier for them. They were friendly, respectful and had a great attitude.<//Review>< Pictures>

These guys are awesome! Super professional! They called me and got to my location early & loaded up quickly. Once they got to my new apartment they unloaded quickly and even tightened up some screws on my bar stools & table. I'm so glad I found them here on Google.  I'll definitely use them again and will refer to anyone that needs movers.</Text>

Movers showed up on time and worked very fast. hey were careful and knew what they were doing. They wrapped everything so there were no damages. They were very pleasant and accommodating.
In my opinion no one takes care of customers belongings like Movers of Sacramento do.
Would give 10 starts if possible.

I would definitely recommend Movers of Sacramento to all my friends and family.< /Review>

Movers of Sacramento movers are fantastic! I have had bad experiences from movers in the past and these guys are great! I was looking for reasonably priced movers but I did not expect the customer service to be so wonderful.  Customer service was great over the phone very helpful and responsive and the two movers they sent were so nice fast and efficient.  Movers of Sacramento is the only way to move.</Text>

<review>We are so thankful to have found Movers of Sacramento ! They were fast, efficient and everything was delivered in perfect condition. Serge, Viktor, Alex, Mike were professional and friendly! We will recommend them to our friends.  I was really impressed with them showing up early to the job. They didn't start the clock until they knew what was being moved and had all the details. We had a few items that were loose and they carefully wrapped and put them safely in the truck. Every item was wrapped up and nothing arrived damaged. They even took time to set up our bed! Their attitude was amazing even in the heat. We were really fortunate to find such a trustworthy group of guys.<//review>< Pics>

Very professional service. We moved two different places into a third one. It was an intense (and long) move. The team of 4 movers stayed focus on the job and even made jokes during their day. Every piece of furniture was carefully wrapped and nothing was broken or even scratched. I definitely recommend their services.</Review>

<text>One of the most important decisions during a move is choosing the right moving company. I've been burned in the past where my expensive furniture have been knicked and bumped around so this time I decided to do a more thorough job finding the right moving company. Movers of Sacramento moving company met all my expectations- was timely, efficient, and took good care of my things.

<review>Moving made easy! The crew showed up on time and worked very quickly. We ended up having them move a bunch of heavy boxes upstairs instead of dropping them in the garage, and they were very patient and accommodating. We will definitely call Dimitri and team for our next move!< /review><name>SJ Kingston<//name>< rating>

What a great job they did! Very professional and provided an excellent and easy move for me. They were both willing to go above and beyond and had great positive attitudes and energy. They were incredibly careful with all of my items and everything survived the move. They were clean, prepared, and secured all my items to avoid excessive movement/potential breakage. I would absolutely recommend this company to help move.</Text>

Mike and Alex were amazing! I am moving from a two story home to a one story house with a ton of stuff. As requested, they arrived at the early part of the 8:00 am - 9:00 am arrival time. They were professional and made moving fun. Everything was done before the 3 hour minimum that they had enough time to assemble my furniture properly.
They were careful with my items and mindful of the new place I am moving into. I know a few more people moving this year and I would definitely recommend them!</Review>

<Review>Best movers in the area hands down. I would highly recommend Serge and his team - they disassembled and moved all of our heavy furniture down three flights of stairs very very fast. They were extremely careful and professional the entire way through. Also they did it all in 100 degree heat. Great people, hard workers and super professional!< /Review>< Pics>

I had a pretty unique move I think, Had a ton of medium to large plants to move as well as 25-30 super heavy large boxes full of books amongst other boxes and stuff from my apartment, moving into a house in Eldorado Hills on a SUPER steep hill, literally 45 degrees incline which they parked on and unloaded from as my driveway was too small. Because of this they also had to use a smaller truck hoping it would fit, (which it didn't, sans the street parking) and I was worried they'd have to make 2 trips.

They didn't need 2 trips, they fit it all miraculously, great Tetris skills! And the whole move which I expected to take twice their 3 hour minimum only took 4 hours. These guys (4 of them) earned their money and then some, never let up, and moved this stuff FAST! I haven't found a ding or crack or scuff on anything either. They do a great job of protecting your items and are fast at prepping it all as needed.

Will always highly recommend these guys from now on. And if you have unique items or location or tons of PLANTS, these guys have the experience to handle it properly.

They were right when they said MOVERS OF SACRAMENTO IS THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE<//review>< Pictures>

This was my first time ever using movers and I was STRESSED. On top of which I have a professional vocal booth that weighs a billion pounds and required dis/assembly.

Alex and his crew totally rocked. Great guys, hardworking as hell, dealing with stairs, heavy stuff, the works. Wrapped my stuff up so nothing got damaged, really thorough with placing items and just making sure I was happy. Basically I felt like I was in good hands, which is everything on moving day.

Overall the company is super transparent and fair with their pricing - I looked at many and they were overall just a perfect fit and best value. Plus they gave me breaks on lots of different details and were honest and upfront from minute one.

I'd use these guys again in a heartbeat. Though hopefully not too soon...

A million thanks to Movers of Sacramento!</text>

THE BEST MOVERS IN TOWN!!! This is The most pleasant move I've ever had!!! They are professional, punctual, courteous, and seem to love their job. They are friendly and move expeditiously and with purpose. They didn't drag their feet and try to milk the process like other companies I have hired that charge by the hour. I can't say enough about how satisfied I am. I would recommend them to any and everyone in search of movers!!!< /review>

Movers were very professional and efficient. They Carefully wrapped all furniture items to insure they didn’t damage anything. Hopefully I don’t have to move again anytime soon but if I do I will be calling this company back. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Serg, Roman, Mike and Alex were amazing!!  They were friendly, prompt and incredibly professional.  They treated each piece like it was their own and I couldn't be happier.  Wish there was more than 5 stars to give.</Review>

My movers names were Alec's and Dmitriy and they were so patient and understanding. There were some unique situations that made this move very difficult and stressful (I can't express this enough) I had  consistent panic attacks all week dreading this move, however the boys were so incredible and caring and made this move as easy for me as possible. I would like to note that I will be a forever client for this company. Best marketing is word of mouth and I will absolutely be recommending Alec and Dmitriy!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< gmap_id>

<Text>First time hiring movers and we had a fantastic experience with Movers of Sacramento about 2 weeks ago.  The 6 guys worked hard and got done before the quoted time.  This included disassembling and reassembling our beds as well as the mirror attached to the dresser.  The team was great and professional.

Also, it was nice that we had someone come out and quote a not to exceed price so we knew what to expect from a cost perspective ahead of time.

Would definitely use this company again!  Thanks for the great experience!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Came here for lunch bc we could walk here. Spectacular, well made food, and you can tell they put thought into making their recipes special! I'd been wanting to stop by for a while but the stars never aligned for a trip until today. Will absolutely be back.

I had the Piggly Wiggly, ham w spicy sauce on baguette, which was delicious - perfect spice level imo. For reference, I prefer "spicy" level kimchi and put Frank's Red Hot on my pizza for added saltiness.

Husband had turkey and avocado. He said it was better than the last place we had sandwiches from, and noted the bread was crusty, had some pep (maybe horseradish, he couldn't remember ingredients) to it.

Covid safe (workers wearing mask + face shield, take out only with order at the door, wiped down payment register bt customers, CC only), and the people inside were very nice. It was $22.50 for two sandwiches and one bag of chips.</Text>

The sandwiches were really good and a good size portion. They use good bread and good ingredients and it makes a big difference. We had the roast beef and wicked piggy, both of which were very good. The horseradish cream and Sriracha cream cheese made the sandwiches. The guy (I think an owner) was super nice and gave me a free cup of coffee to try (it was strong but not too overpowering or burnt) and mentioned they have a shop in Oakland too. The inside is small so it's more of a take out place, but there is a small counter that could fit 4 or 5 people and some tables outside. I'll definitely go back.</Text>

The breakfast sandwich is super delicious
The cold brew is amazing
And we were super grateful to be welcomed to the neighborhood with a smile behind the mask that we felt through the service and community reciprocity<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Just ate another wonderful sandwich from Cafe Nine. This hidden gem is a wonderful place to get coffees, treats & lunch. Homemade soup, muffins baked in house daily & a full menu of delicious luncheon treats. My favorite right now is the tuna. It is different in that it is not just mayo & good quality tuna on Acme rye bread. It has substance & can stand alone. Great either as tuna salad, sandwich roll or tuna melt. I know I put something good in my body when I grab a sandwich to take home after my PT with JinJin next door. I highly recommend this place!</text>< Pics>

The owners there are VERY friendly and make you feel welcome. It was my first visit and they were greeting all the rest of the customers as if they were friends, asking "Will you be having your usual?" Such a lovely little place.

Best breakfast burrito we've had in a LONG time.<//text>

<Review>Deliciousness, with really really good veggie and really really good meaty options. Also, these people are so nice and anyone who is beginning to feel down about getting unenjoyable food from people who don't like them very much should come in here and feel renewed. Great experience every time.

Wraps are juicy and will leak inside your purse if you are dumb enough to put one in there and go for a long bumpy walk. Better choice to eat at the cute window bar or outdoor seating area with awesome decoupage-style table and chairs!

If they decide they aren't staying busy enough and go away, I will blame YOU. Go eat there now and make sure I get to keep eating at Cafe N!ne!!!</Review>< Pics>

This is drastically overdue but Cafe N!ne is a fabulous neighborhood spot. Kita and Gannon (sp?) are super friendly and nice, the food is DELICIOUS (I am addicted to their breakfast sandwiches) and they have treats for our pup whenever we bring him. Their menu isn't huge but everything on there is tasty and they are happy to customize orders. Really good quality food. Try it, you won't be disappointed.<//text>

Delicious fresh sandwiches and coffee, made with charm in a delightful little cafe with outdoor tables, walkable right off the Ohlone Greenway.</Text>

<Review>Superb sandwiches, strong (as advertised) coffee. Both staffers are engaged with customers, activity soliciting (and taking!) feedback from the customers of this new coffee/sandwich shop.

A few things stood out to me, first - the good:

They have a free library! A few small bookcases filled with a rather eclectic selection of books. I asked, and the books are free to read - and take with you! The "take with you" part is on an honor system that you will either return it or replace it with a different book.

Among other things, I suggested that they add a squeeze  bottle of simple sugar to their cream/sugar/etc bar of additions for drinks - as it's the best way to sweeten cold drinks. They agreed - and pointed to a white board where "add simple syrup" (to coffee condiments) as already on their "To Do" list. But they went beyond that and offered to make up a bit - on the spot - so I could sweeten my cold pressed iced coffee (as I'd already added sugar and stirred vigorously, I declined)!

They also were quite interested in my suggestion to get their pastries from Starter bakery. Currently, they're using City Bakery (the same ones Peet's uses), but should business allow (they are, after all, a startup), they plan on switching to a premium bakery - and noted my preference.

The bad:

Nothing actually bad about my experience, but I see two obstacles to long term success of this startup: Parking and Seating.

Parking: Cafe N!ne is one of a number of storefront businesses that share this corner mall. While the mall has a parking lot, far too many of the spaces were marked as "Reserved for Bank of the West" resulting in almost no parking available for the rest of the businesses. As I sat in their outdoor seating area consuming my delicious cold brew and ham sandwich, I observed no fewer than 5 cars waiting patiently for a non-bank space to open. This doesn't bode well for future visits.

Seating: It's lacking. There is a 4 seat counter across from the cash register, and seating for another 12-15 people outside. Should their business attract the customer base that their coffee and sandwiches deserves, seating will be hard to find - impossible in cold/windy weather.

I didn't ding any stars for these negatives. Cafe N!ne is a startup, likely on a limited budget. I'm betting they took the space because they can afford it. Hopefully, they do well enough to move to someplace nearby without the negatives I've mentioned. I hope they succeed.<//Review><rate>5< /rate><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>111524681621264503243< /user_id><gmapID>0x808578ff871c34bd:0x55cfbd0fb15fe562</gmapID><Time>1512688874302<//Time><user_name>Steven Dorst< /user_name></record>

Tech Jay Magana was professional and took the time to explain everything he was doing and why. I decided to upgrade the service I was getting done and he stayed and got it done. Easy to get an appointment set up, tech showed up on time, and work was completed quick. The air conditioner is working great. Truly appreciate the awesome work this company did.< /text>

<Text>Ruben came to check my ac duct because there’s no air coming out the grille. He is super professional, polite and provide me couple solutions. Instead of “selling” the most profitable services, he suggested to do the most cost effective option first, if not working, then go to next option. And it works. I will definitely call nexgen and ask for Ruben when I need AC services next time.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< Review>
I made an appointment online on a Sunday since my AC went out.the appointment was for the next day. An hour after I made the appointment an associate called me to confirm a time. Made the appointment. They emailed me and texted me confirmations of the appointment. The time changed and then they notified me again. They are very good communicators.
The technician showed up with gear and a tablet. Went to the ac unit , checked all my ac related equipment, and then discussed with me 5 priced out solutions for the repair. From 1-5 was most expensive to least expensive cost scenarios. I chose the cheapest solution of course, and the technician Brandon Alvarez, didn’t push us or try to up sell us at all. He was great and very nice. He fixed our Broken AC that same day in like 30 minutes!<//Review>

<Review>Would highly recommend NexGen to service your AC/Heating.  Shaun arrived before the scheduled time and did a thorough evaluation of our heater and air conditioner (he called to ask if it was ok to come sooner).  He explained what he did, the results and what is needed to keep the system working properly.  He wore a mask and booties the entire time he was in the house.  He is a great ambassador for NexGen.  Would definitely call them for any future AC/Heating needs.

<text>I had my AC replaced and the system is awesome and I believe that this company takes pride in their work and respect the concerns from the customer.  I did not feel pressured in purchasing the system and have not had any problems with the unit.  I did not replace my heater at the same time, and what a big mistake.  So now I also have purchased the heating unit (two years later) and was grateful when the technician came out so quickly when the carrier heating unit was making noises and the fan would not shut off.  The crew that came out replaced the heater and I am thankful they did this quickly.  If I did not have the technician come out there could have been a possible injury to my house or to me.  The company is very professional and are there to answer your questions or concerns.  I am happy we went with this company.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

NexGen sent out a service technician within a day of our service request. The technician, Roger Cuadra, was extremely thorough in assessing our unit and explaining his findings, as well as giving his recommendations for keeping it running efficiently and prolonging its life.  I highly recommend NexGen, and more specifically Roger.< /text>

JOSE diagnosed the real issue (clog at island side, not main sink, used camera and long snake and gasket to fix. ) with a 5 star film shoot, and pressure from director, problem solved.

Patrick repaired my AC unit instead of trying to sell me a new Trane unit.  When my old unit finally dies, I will buy a new highly rated Goldman unit from NexGen for half the price of a Trane unit.  They earned my business.< /text>

Nexgen was a referral from a trust friend; nevertheless, we still did our due diligence and got other bids.

Here are the reasons I particularly loved Nexgen:
- Most of the bids we received came back with less than desirable feedback/quotes on adding A/C to our central heating - there was only one place who had a significantly cheaper quote. However, it was Nexgen who took the time to explain why it was going to be more complex than just adding in A/C (having to do with the location of our heaters) and therefore more expensive, and continued to explain that if they put in our A/C, they want to make sure it's right and not done poorly.
- The installation team was extremely professional, knowledgeable, clean, and were very timely in getting answers to questions they didn't know.
- The A/C works great!</text>

<Text>I am furious and I will NEVER call or recommend you for anything.
Dan seemed more concerned about selling me a new heating unit then fixing my existing unit. He did go on the roof and checked the heating system. He concluded that there was nothing wrong with my unit but my thermostat and charged me 265.00 dollars on my debit card for a thermostat. Excessive but I was desperate.
The heater began working but then it stopped working. He went back on the roof, came back and told me this story about how corroded my unit was and that I really needed to get it replaced. Dan also told me not to run the heating system because it was so corroded and my disabled brother and I could risk inhaling carbon monoxide fumes. He was a good salesman. He wanted to set up a meeting with a supervisor and I initially agreed until that night when I came to my senses and cancelled.
I had a reputable heating business come out and they looked at the limit stick that Dan said fell off in his hand, and found that Dan broke it. They also said that I didn’t need to replace the unit and that the limit stick that Dan broke they can replace. Oh Dan also told me that it was going to cost 3,000-4,0000 dollars to repair my system which was a LIE!
I am furious. Our electricity bill will now be astronomical thanks to Dan and that my disabled brother suffering from Huntington’s Disease that I had to keep him warm with expensive space heaters from Home Depot because he is unable to regulate his body temperature! He MUST stay warm!
I want my  ALL OF MY MONEY refunded to me and the thermostat should be given to me from all the hell you all put me through.
I am definitely reporting  you to the BBB and posting this on YELP! This is ridiculous!!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Super Company.  Super Service.  Mark came out to one of our properties to do the Summer Checkup on our combo package unit (roof mounted).  He checked everything.  After he was done, and left, the system was still not working correctly.  He came back and fixed the outstanding problem.  Excellent service.  Expert care.  Everything is fine now!<//Review>

<review>Randy and Travis explained everything and went right to work. This was a complete instal of heating and air conditioning from scratch.Oh it was 101' that day in the valley they did not complain once about going into the attic. Many things they did and most impressive is the company Nexgen pulls a permit for the installation. so you know you're receiving the most qualified workmanship in the industry. To my surprise and happiness they completed the job in one day. They removed the asbestos  installed all new ducting and wired the entire units. everything is up to code. This is a big company who takes care of their family which to me is extremely important. Thank you very much and yes i would and have recommended you to my family and friends. robert<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1565193606617, 'text': 'Hello Robert.

James and the Nexgen air guys saved me a small fortune!

One of my AC units was not working.  The first company I called looked at the unit (which is in a somewhat difficult spot to service) and immediately told me I needed to replace both units for around $8,000.  Ouch!   I called Nexgen for a second opinion.  The service tech James arrived on time and gladly pulled up all the deck boards he needed to in order to service the unit.  He quickly discovered the capacitor had blown.  $300 repair and done in under an hour.

Can't speak highly enough of these guys!<//Text>

Louis gave a thorough inspection and provided documentation on the heating and AC units that would be installed, and broke down the estimate so the homeowner could clearly see what each aspect of the work would cost.  I really appreciated that there was no attempt to upsell us.<//Review>

This company is located 0.6 miles From my home. They told me after putting me on a brief hold that they’re very sorry they do not service my area but they are working on expanding.

<review>Awesome! My old, scrapped together system my dad put in the house went out and i needed a whole new system. I called Nexgen and they came out the same day to inspect it and had someone out the next day to tell me what i needed and 5 guys showed the very next morning. Wow! And this was during summer. Buy the end of the day it was done. New condenser, heating unit and coil plus all new ducting. The best part, they hauled all the old stuff away so i didnt have to deal with it. They even had to reconstruct the closet it was in. Excellent!</review><user_id>105642081697881818138</user_id>< rate>

The technicians that came out were terrific!! Starting with the first repairmen that came out, he was very knowledgeable. Gave great details on what the problem was. The salesman that came out to help us choose the correct system for our home, was very courteous and helpful. The day of installation the techs were great. They did an amazing job. They were able to let us know about the changes that needed to be done to better our system in the home. The techs got the job done in one day. They worked hard and the new system runs great. They explained everything with great detail so we’d understand how to clean the filter, use the thermostat and so forth. So happy our family decided to go with NexGen!!

Mario came out and was very nice, clean and knowledgable of his job. Didn't try to sell us a new unit ( 12 years old) he fixed the part and educates us on our filters.

<Text>When I first moved here this was one of the major downtown SF shopping stops. With all of the high-end designer stores and small,but well known up and coming stores all in one short walk from one another. It also was and still is a center point for the Bart, SF Muni, the Trolly Car rides, and all other spots that the average tourist wants to see  when visiting SF.Its been several years since my move here and even though this area itself (buildings, landscaping and outlay) hasn't changed much from my first visit until now, a lot of the artsy, musical, diverse and welcoming events, displays and demonstrations now are either no longer present aa a Was wee wdifferent when you visit this area. The major overall feel is no longer there. "THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO" is gone and  "lets get the hell outta here and back home" has arrived. With the covid-19 pandemic here, and homeless/society's misfits deciding to take the area over as one of their playgrounds.... This district is not fairing too well in the areas of tourism, upkeep, or saftey<//Text>< time>

Better than before.  Cleaner.  No benches / seating though.  Watch your stuff.  There is still a pickpocket and grab & run theft problem.< /Text>

Avoid this gateway to the Tenderloin!  Homeless, some very aggressive and angry, linger all times of the day, particularly near the fast food joint.  The stench of human waste and pot is inescapable.< /review>

Just off of Market steeet and across the street from Nordstrom Rack is a Carl's Jr. and a smaller office building (with Caminar testing & job placement, a Judicial Performance institution, and other offices). It's also across from the back side of the Burger King and Sephora on Powell. Busy and lots of action. The Powell Steeet Muni and Bart are there as well as the SF Center.<//Review>

If your in this location then it's probably for the visitor information centre which is in a hole in the ground, this isn't a good place to hang around in, think of crazy central and times it by 10. With this being the main tourist spot for the Powell cable car turn around & shopping along Market Street there is an unprecedented amount of vagrant's begging & most of them are as mad as a box of frogs.</text>

Great selection of cichlids and aquarium plants. Nice clean tanks, everything priced, no guessing. Good selection of aquariums, supplies, and frozen foods.</Review>

I cannot say enough good things about these guys. I wanna say I’ve been coming here since April 2020. Nolan, Joey and Alex just have fueled my passion for the hobby especially during the pandemic. They’re always super helpful and I just love how I’m at point where I can just text them and get the info or things I need. Show up, pay and be done. Super happy I’ve built this relationship with them. I encourage everyone to. If you’re not happy about something, say something. They will
Work with you and are very fair. These guys are here to help you and your passion for this hobby. Each of them are always nice. Heck I’ve met Nolans wife and she’s so nice. I just love coming here for all my aquatic needs, fish, plants, food. I won’t go anywhere else. Support local businesses. When it’s not busy there it’s always just cool to talk about life, tv shows, sci fi things. Nolan, Joe and Alex! Thank you for what you guys do for our community.<//Text>

Great place to get rare fish and great prices. I got my fish food here and also a decorative item my son wanted. If your near Disneyland. This is a great place to stop by. He also ships items to you if your out of town. Amazing color of the fishes. He also sells special lighting for plants. He has great selection of plants. Must stop by fish store..</text>

<review>I moved to Southern California for school and I unfortunately had to leave my beloved fish tank with my parents. I was reluctant to start a new tank because I didn't know anything about the local fish stores here and i missed the kind feeling of the stores back home. On a whim, I visited Nolan's one weekend and I was absolutely amazed. The staff was extremely friendly! The fish and the plants looked very happy and healthy. I'm not exaggerating the tanks look clean enough to be an exhibit. The staff is always willing to give advice and they are very accommodating. With the help of Nolan and his crew, I was able to create an aquarium better than the one I have back home!</review><username>Reyson Sioson< /username></record></dataset><record>

Been here about 5 times and I've bought fish 3 times. Super healthy and quality fish. You can see in each tank that the fish are healthy and fed very well. Their potted plants are good, and they have a good selection on tissue cultures. Great selection and prices on hardscape. Not so much selection on aquarium accessories but def go to for buying fish.<//review>

What a nice place to visit if you are really interested at aquarium and care about them. The strong reason I highly recommend this place is not many fish store care fish as much as Nolan does. With separate quarantine for healthy fish and a natural way of treatment (of course it will be more pricy for business expense wise other than putting just chemicals in the tank) before selling them to customers will make you peace of mind for brining healthy fish to your home.< /Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcd90c23b2cedd:0x6f7affcc1dd244a9<//Gmap_id><review>Out of all the fish stores I've visited while in the fishkeeping hobby this has to be hands down in the best I have seen! You can really tell when walking in that the owner is passionate about his business. All the aquariums are well kept, the plant selection is just ridiculous, every kind of aqua scaping material can be found here, and the variety of freshwater fish, particular so with cichlids is insane. Prices are extremely reasonable and the fish are very healthy. Thorough Covid protocols such as wearing a mask and hand sanitization at entry are very reassuring. This is a hidden gem that is worth the visit.<//review>< user>

<review>So I originally found this place online. My first order was some plants and they all arrived perfectly packed and healthy. I didn't quarantine them before putting them in and they acclimated to my tank just fine and are alive and well. Bonus, no melting and no hitchhikers either.

I placed another online order but this time I decided to go into the shop since I was going to be in town. Alex was there to assist and he was a great help. I wanted multiple Java fern but only one of them looked really good so he let me choose another place to replace the one I'd ordered. I ended up with an Anubias Nana, I've got those in my tank too. Finally he helped me pick out some bodacious blue Japanese trapdoor snails. On the way home I had some questions and was able to text them and got a response immediately. These guys are great to work with!< /review><user_id>104449466003723488405< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Great aquarium store for people new to the hobby and seasoned hobbyists as well. Amazing selection of African cichlids and one of the few stores I have seen that caters to the aquascape crowd as well. Their hardscape selection is better than other stores I have been to.</Review>

Definitely a step above your average mom and pop fish store.  A few varieties that you don't see in other shops.  Strengths were malawi cichlids and plants.  Weaknesses were in  average price point fish and Favorites like live bearers and tetras.
Service was dry and distant .   Despite being the only customer there.

Other wise a good place to check out especially for African cichlids or the planted aquarium.    New and up incoming and a lot of potential.< /Review>

<text>Nolan was super easy to deal with Her even delivered my tank to my house! He also took the time to go over the filter set up with me.

I originally had ordered a stand, but there was a personal issue with his carpenter. He was honest about and kept me informed about it.

I really appreciate honesty especially when there's an issue that could have sunk his sale. Luckily for me I was upgrading the size of my turtle tank and the table I was using fit the new tank perfectly.

I found him on Craigslist. Which as most know can be really hit or miss. I was pleasantly surprised that he didn't just have a bunch of tanks for sale in commercial location. He has a full aquarium store with live fish for sale etc!</text>< Pics>

Overall a small and unassuming outside appearance but a very homey place to browse and shop for fish.</text></record>

Reviews are all true. Truly a five-star experience here! My daughter and I came by to take a look at some fish to add to her tank and Nolan is extremely knowledgeable, cordial, professional and the prices are excellent.<//review>

Great little shop, especially if you are into cichlids. I'd recommend stopping by just to check it out. Located in a weird spot being in the middle of a business park, but it works.</Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>A large selection - all kinds of fish, amazing, beautiful fish. The shop is kinda hard to find, but trust me, it's worth it. It's all the way in the back, behind the other buildings. It has a small sign in the window above the door.

I bought two mystery snails from Nolan. (They were beautiful and started right away on the diatoms in my king betta's five-gallon tank. Unfortunately, the fish killed them within two days.) I'll be back for more snails, maybe a couple of nerites.

I wish I had a large aquarium; I'd let Nolan stock it. Go to Nolan's Aquarium. (Bonus: he's a great guy.)</text></record></dataset><record>

Best place to purchase cichlids fish and products!
Big fish selection!!
This guy knows his stuff. He breeds his fishes and takes excellent care for them all. Provided excellent costumer service . This is now my go to place for fish supply and fishes.

< Review>
A Beverly Hills institution. I’m glad to see that they aren’t closed post-covid so one could still enjoy some tasty pastrami. You can order ahead online or via phone. You can specify a pick up time online, but if you try to specify a time over the phone, it doesn’t work. Our sandwiches seemed to have been sitting for a while, but the pastrami was still delicious (albeit the bread was a tad soggy). Credit cards are accepted. Street parking.

The New Yorker with the coleslaw and Russian dressing is my go-to. The thick cut pastrami is so deliciously fatty and the creaminess of the dressing complements it well. If you like mustard, it adds some needed acidity as you progress into the sandwich. You get an option of a side, and I typically go for the macaroni salad. On my most recent pick up, the sides were missing but at least the pickles were there. You can pick the type of bread, but the standard is double baked rye. You’ll probably enter a food coma if you eat both sandwiches, but it’s well worth it.</Review>

<Review>phenomenal! super small and crowded, but definitely worth it. we all got chicken sandwiches, some spicy and some regular, and loved them. the loaded curly fries were also awesome. they were smaller than we expected, so we ended up ordering one more order for our group of 4. good quality, great flavor, all around a really good experience.</Review>< pictures>

An LA Classic Eatery in the same location for, like, 150 years! 🤣 They have a very well designed setup for pickup of to-go and phone orders. Very impressive. This time I had the Beverly, a huge, delicious sandwich of pastrami, corned beef, swiss cheese, coleslaw, Russian dressing, on Rye Bread. I'm usually a traditionalist of Pastrami On Rye w/Deli Mustard, but this may be my new go-to sandwich. It's big enough to share - but I ate the whole thing!<//review>

<date>1613450520181< /date><rating>5<//rating><text>Classic landmark jewish style deli right in DT Beverly Hills. Pastrami on rye w deli mustard was spot on and brings you back to NYC. Portion size was appropriate, but you can always use more, let's be real. Potato salad had a nice balance of eggyness and not overpowered with mayo. Black and white cookie also super tasty. A little pricy but the location and specialty is worth it.  Pastrami here is overall better than other jewish style spots in LA.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAg2kDiBfJ-xO-LwDkRtO4lI8o_bTi8h6T_u0X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<text>Nate n Als is an institution! It's old world. Food is fresh and authentic. The only thing I'd like to see is to update the decor a little. It's tired, a little dark and doesn't smell the freshest. I know people will disagree with me because they wouldn't want it to change but, If done right, it could stay authentic and still get a refresh...<//text>< pictures>

<text>This is my first stop in Beverly Hills when I arrive in the USA. As a person who lived in NYC I can really say what pastrami is, how it has to taste and how pastrami must be. I am maybe one of the only persons on the planet who made his own pastrami day and went to 11 (!!!!) of the most famous pastrami places in nyc. In ONE DAY! if someone on this planet would have told me that the pastrami place in Beverly Hills is beating Katz's, Ben's Best and Artie's - I would have never believed him. But it is true. Nate and Al is not fancy because it is in Beverly Hills. It is the best because they offer the best pastrami on planet earth, authentic location, extremely nice service and fair pricing. Never miss going to Nate and Al when you are in Beverly Hills.<//text>< Pics>

<Date>1593143174813<//Date><review>Traveled very far to get chopped chicken liver sandwich. Not as good as my mom’s or grandma’s but That was 75 years ago and definitely next best. Delicious. Pickle was even the best. Just wonderful memories. The only thing missing was the sound of my mom making it. Thanks for the memories, Nate n Al! As for the review that it’s heavy food, Ashkenazi food IS heavy. Mmm!< /review><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

This is my first stop in Beverly Hills when I arrive in the USA. As a person who lived in NYC I can really say what pastrami is, how it has to taste and how pastrami must be. I am maybe one of the only persons on the planet who made his own pastrami day and went to 11 (!!!!) of the most famous pastrami places in nyc. In ONE DAY! if someone on this planet would have told me that the pastrami place in Beverly Hills is beating Katz's, Ben's Best and Artie's - I would have never believed him. But it is true. Nate and Al is not fancy because it is in Beverly Hills. It is the best because they offer the best pastrami on planet earth, authentic location, extremely nice service and fair pricing. Never miss going to Nate and Al when you are in Beverly Hills.< /text>

Oh dear. Deli staff just as you would expect them to be in a busy deli and friendly in there own way. Food not West coast at all. Asked for a simple two egg omelette and got what must have been at least  a five egg version with glue all over it which turned out to be fake cheese. Almost inedible. Pity because it is a great location.<//review>

I went as a tourist - I could tell though that as well known as this place is online, most of the customers are locals. When you see a bunch of grandparents with their family you know it's a good place lol. I got the Nate'n Al sandwich and the pastrami was delicious! I got a half but it was so big I couldn't finish it. The hot dogs were great as well, the chili was really good. My personal favorite though was the side macaroni salad.<//Text>

Unfortunately alcohol is forbidden on the patio but I imagine that's an issue with the city/state rather than the Deli. We had a fantastic server named Ricardo.
It's one of those places that you can understand why they're famous (and have been around for so long). Towering delicious and difficult (in the best way) pastrami sandwiches and amazing smoked salmon. Definitely one of the most worthwhile places in Beverly Hills.< /text>

This place is just average to me.  I've found other delis that are much better.  However, I do have a high standard when it comes to delis since I come from New York.

I can't honestly recommended this place.</Review>

New owners remove all the complimentary reviews. Smaller portions and you get4 pickle slices and if you want more $2.95.  Not another first rate deli in the world charges for more pickles. Go elsewhere.  They will close. A deli needs to be generous< /Text>

But I had to reconstruct the sandwich because it had a big RIDICULOUS looking big ball of meatier  the center. Made the center twice as thick as distributed result after re stacking. Reminded me of prepackaged sandwiches at a gas station trying to look well filled. That's a shame because the sandwich re stacked into awesomeness. They make the Pastrami, Corned Beef and bake the bread.<//text>< userid>

If you're looking for a nostalgic diner type restaurant with a delicatessen inside, cozy booths and fairly good service then you'll want to stop into this deli that is a classic in Beverly hills since 1945.  The service was good my corned beef sandwich and onion rings were great however we took home a piece of the New York cheesecake and it was a little below par. The really interesting thing is that it was packed when we got there at 6 and stayed busy until almost 9 p.m. which is what time it closes.it's a casual place and there were all ages from children to Grandma and Grandpa!< /Review>

<Review>I've always liked Nate'n Al. I had bad experience about 4 years ago. The server was unbearable and would never come to our table, completely forget about us. Following that experience, I gave Nate'n Al a two year break. No matter how much I loved Nate'n Al, I wasn't going to put myself through that again. Finally, a little more than two years following the bad service, a friend and I returned. The service was great and the food was good as it's always been. The corned beef and pastrami are so good! Their matzo ball soup is really good too!< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2bc07990d2ebd:0xf1a793d3a7764bdb</GmapID><user>102524962995733065369< /user>< Pictures>

<Text>The BEST, BEST, BEST deli in LA. The sandwiches are to die for.  The matzo ball soup is MAGIC. It'll cure anything that ails you.  A lot of the wait staff have been there for years, so it's great to develop your favorite to take care of your needs.  Be prepared for Beverly Hills prices but considering the quality and quantity, it's well worth it.  A good place to catch a celebrity grabbing a nosh.<//Text>< Pictures>

If you are throwing caution to the winds, and ready to embrace sugar and fat, this old school Jewish deli will make you happy.
It's a pretty classic Jewish deli menu. I can't tell you much about most of it, because I always get the pastrami sandwich which is first rate.
The wait staff is friendly and helpful and a few of them are real characters in a good way.
I believe there are some menu choices for the health conscious and even vegans these days --
But honestly, if that's your lifestyle, what the hell are you doing HERE lol!?<//text>

<text>Not only has the quality dropped, but they no longer bring sauerkraut to the table along with pickles.  And they now charge for more than one small plate.  It’s not cheap to eat there.  You’d think they could afford some kraut and pickles.  Additionally, all four of us had the same comment, and that is the food tasted bland.  One of my favorite dishes, chicken livers is no longer served there either.  Sad to say, but I’m probably not going back.< /text>< user_id>

Always friendly and if go a bit past rush hours you will not have to wait. It's also open into the late evening.

It is without exception the best deli restaurant in the city. The breakfasts are terrific, prepared with skill and the sandwiches are outstanding.

You will never feel pressure and they will adapt to what you want. It's a city landmark!<//Text>

This is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. When we requested sauce for our onion rings, the waitress did not stop walking or even look at us (she did hear because she did bring the dip). Our waitress did not check on us and the busboy did not ask if we were finished before clearing our plates. I wish I could say the food was good but our sandwiches were exceptionally average. I have no idea how this place has such good reviews. Avoid!</text>

So great place thx
went as a tourist - I could tell though that as well known as this place is online, most of the customers are locals. When you see a bunch of grandparents with their family you know it's a good place lol. I got the Nate'n Al sandwich and the pastrami was delicious! I got a half but it was so big I couldn't finish it. The hot dogs were great as well, the chili was really good. My personal favorite though was the side macaroni salad.< /Review>

A wonderful deli in the heart of the Wilshire/Rodeo shopping district.  Highly recommend for an inexpensive meal in an expensive neighborhood.   Service as expected in a locals restaurant, there is a definite feeling of familiarity between the staff and customers.  You will, I hope feel the same home like atmosphere.< /Text>

If you're craving a good deli, this is the place. It's been in business for 70 years which is amazing and doesn't happen very often in Los Angeles. Portions are huge. Sandwiches are massive. Service is great. Oh, the pickles are just what you need to go with your deli meal.< /Review>

Now this place is interesting. It's in the middle of Beverly Hills, which I didn't realize until we actually got there. Next in a way it's kind of like a personalized version of a Denny's, you know, a diner type but with a little bit more Panache or something? You can tell that it's been around for a long time and it's not kept up the way it should be, or maybe it is and just meant to be not kept up too much so it doesn't look too good. You know, it reminds me of a woman that is beautiful who knows she's beautiful- this place knows it's a place to go, right, so they can have that Pseudo relaxed look. the food, we have sandwiches was Adesa sandwich place and they did serve the fries Crist and it was tasty which are all good things in my book. The staff, at least the ones we spoke to, are Russian or close enough that they understood when we spoke Russian to them. I like the place and I was told that sometimes stars are there although you know how I am I don't really care about that we're just on our way to the coast and it was a place to stop off at. I would give it a five I mean, it's deserving of it although it's probably more of a 4.6 to 4.8 for its quasi haughtiness right? but then again it's in Beverly Hills which isn't it full of people like that and stuff like that?< /review>

This was my first time at Nate'n Al. My friend and her mother who brought me there had both been going since they were little children. Since it was my first time there, I got the signature Nate'n Al sandwich, which is hot pastrami, tomato, lettuce, and Russian dressing. I got it on rye with a side of cole slaw and a cup of matzo ball soup. Everything was really good. Also the pickles are fantastic! My friend says you can tell a lot from a person based on whether they prefer the old or new dills. They were both awesome (I'm partial to the old ones - they pack a punch!). The space is vibrant, has a lot of history, and apparently it's not uncommon to run into celebs.<//Review>

I'm a regular patron and can't say enough god things about the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches as well as the mushroom barley soup.  When I'm really eating only Paleo, I get eggs over easy and turkey bacon.  They make the bacon crisp and super crunchy.  The only thing I don't recommend is the salads, but why go to a deli for salads, anyhow?  Not their forte.  Stick to the soups and meaty sandwiches.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>One street over from world famous Rodeo drive is a LA institution, the closest you will get to NYC on the West Coast: Nate'n Al.

This little place has been serving up the good since the 1940's and is a fantastic choice for breakfast or lunch. They say that several A-Listers come to the spot frequently including Larry King, but you may not recognize them in a hat and glasses.

On a recent visit we found a 20 minute wait and opted to sit outside. The waitress was friendly and attentive, while the host got us our drinks. Coke comes in a can here, the old fashion way.

The omelet was incredible, as was the onion bagel.  Prices were fair to average. Portions were fine. Coffee came quick and so did the refills. We were treated right, and tried our best not to stand out as tourists as it was obvious that most of the people were were locals or regulars.

Down to the pickles and sandwiches this place was 100% authentic NYC style Jewish deli. I can't wait to go back.</text>< pics>

<text>Old style New York - Jewish delicatessen in the heart of Beverly Hills. This is establishment has been there forever. The wait staff is also been there forever. There are regulars that come here and have their own tables or booths. It's a loud, raucous place. Services typically good. If Deli is your thing this is the place for you. I typically don't eat there I get stuff from the the deli itself and take it home. Good pastrami, corned beef, chopped chicken liver and bagels and rye bread.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Crowed, crazy, noisy and poor design at the entrance where you have to wait for a seat but the food is REALLY good and it is quintessential Beverly Hills after all. Worth all the hassles and I'm told they are moving to a larger location in BH pretty soon.<//Text>

One street over from world famous Rodeo drive is a LA institution, the closest you will get to NYC on the West Coast: Nate'n Al.

This little place has been serving up the good since the 1940's and is a fantastic choice for breakfast or lunch. They say that several A-Listers come to the spot frequently including Larry King, but you may not recognize them in a hat and glasses.

On a recent visit we found a 20 minute wait and opted to sit outside. The waitress was friendly and attentive, while the host got us our drinks. Coke comes in a can here, the old fashion way.

The omelet was incredible, as was the onion bagel.  Prices were fair to average. Portions were fine. Coffee came quick and so did the refills. We were treated right, and tried our best not to stand out as tourists as it was obvious that most of the people were were locals or regulars.

Down to the pickles and sandwiches this place was 100% authentic NYC style Jewish deli. I can't wait to go back.</Text>

I arrived with two other friends and were completely ignored standing right in the doorway for 5 mins. Someone then spoke to us but only wrote my name down and said she’ll get back to us, meanwhile there was an empty table in front of us that had dirty plates the whole time. They only seem to speak to locals that they know. We stood another 5 mins being ignored and then after another couple walked in and was given menus and seated immediately we just gave up and walked out.</Review>

The place looks like an average diner but... The sandwiches are excellent and big. Best Ruben  I've had probably due to the melt in you're mouth pastrami. Get the CHEESECAKE it's the best, I compare all other cheesecakes to this one. I try to go here every time I'm in LA. This place gets really busy so avoid the normal hot times if you can.</Text>

< Review>
Cold soup. Stale bread. Botched orders. And a waitress well past her expiration date. This wasn't any run-of-the-mill bad service. No. This was an EPIC... absurd... cinematic tour de farce. Four of us were celebrating our friend's birthday. Unfortunately it was toxic. I took the manager aside as we left and let him know none of us would be back. He was apologetic—but not surprised. That tells me that they just don't care. And that's a much bigger problem than one server having a bad day.

💡In BH, if you want great authentic deli and friendly, competent service, head up Beverly Glen to the Beverly Glen Deli in the Beverly Glen Center. It's the last left before you get to Mulholland. Their chicken salad is a revelation. Mazel tov!<//Review>

I've been going here for at least 30 years. I no longer live in the area but it's one of the first places I go when I'm visiting.  There is usually a long wait with nowhere to sit but you can go outside in the nice weather and walk around.   There is nothing on the menu that isn't wonderful.  Very large portions.</Review>

Both me and my wife agree,  if you love pastrami or cornbeef, Nate'n Al is 5 stars. The pastrami is New York style I guess,  thick and moist. We both love The Hat, but there is no comparison in the quality of the meat. Keep your eyes open for celebrities too,  you just might see one there.<//Text>

Not that this place NEEDS a 5-star review (with all it's famed history and heritage)... but it walks the walk of a 5-star deli that slings meat and bread like nobody's business... walk in there on a week day lunch and take a nap in one of those beautiful leather booths... kidding about the nap thing... but the leather IS beautiful.</Review>

Love this diner. Keep going since 2001. Right before Shwartzneger won election, I was dining in a summer when Maria Shriver walked in with 2 beautiful daughters, who looked like teens, maybe younger. Was lunch time, place was busy. Manager was rushing towards her, sat them on a table right next to mine in front. Maria Shriver looked gorgeous, very thin, kind of artificially thin and sculptured. What a fool Shwartzneger! I remember manager said to her " I hope he wins". I was finishing up my salad and she sort of stared at me. Well, I was like real pretty and dress very well. I just love this MY style diner. Great sandwiches and soups too.</Text>

Yummy dinner fare. Service is fun and sassy.  Place feels cosy but well worn.  Not a place to be if you work in the film industry and don't want to run into people. Try the sturgeon.  It's delicious.< /Review>

<text>Service was abysmal. We were basically ignored the entire time. Food was passable but nothing to come back for. Ordered a sandwich and was given meat and bread on a plate.<//text><Date>1552858023608< /Date>< Pictures>

My family frequents Nate 'n Al's regularly and has done so for decades. The service is friendly and attentive. Now that I am gluten sensitive I miss enjoying all the amazing sandwiches, but I can still have a delicious spinach salad!<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Always a great time. I had a tuna and provolone melt on rye, which was delicious! The other people who I was with ordered a lox, egg and onion scramble which was so tasty. But potato’s that came with were lifeless and no flavor. Another got eggs Benedict who said “it was okay”. Didn’t like the sauce (too bland).

One person got a picture of their meal.<//Text><Date>1535950089706</Date>< Response>

A reassuring standby. Ages of deals made here, friendships solidified here over fine deli. Heard that it may get levelled to make way for an Apple Store. That would wipe out all the many generations of ghosts which give this place its aura, and Beverly Hills some history other than rampant luxury consumerism.<//Text>

Pastrami is very good, but don't expect anything like the storied delis in NYC.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

So I read all the great reviews and it was a great disappointment. I went to the counter to order take out.  I waited and waited for someone behind the counter to take my order. Finally I spoke up and
someone said the kid is only helping out. So after 15 minutes no one would take my order. As I was leaving he pointed to number 21.  I had 35 and he said well it's 45 minutes any way. Someone else along side me left as well. I got in my car and drove to Canter's on Fairfax. Better reconsidered next time. Canter's was great!< /text>

My husband And I had dinner at N & A last night. After we were seated a busboy brought us water. I
A half hour later the server finally came to take our order which was two omelets. It took another half hour for the food to arrive. It was very average. I ordered a second cup of coffee. The server forgot to bring it until he passed by more than an hour later and I reminded him. The empty dishes remained on our table for about an hour after that, until I cleared the table for myself and the other couple we were with. They thought it was amusing, but I was tired at looking at the dirty dishes.
I will never returned to that restaurant again. The omelets are better at IHOP and so is the service.< /text>

<review>Can't say enough positive things about this place.  Amazing staff, great food, with the occasional celebrity sighting.  Must eat the pastrami eggs Benedict.  Eggs jiggle when you shake the plate!  The perfect test for an eggs Benny!  Their hashbrowns truly are the gold standard and you'll find yourself comparing them to every other set of hashbrowns for the rest of your life. I would rank this place in the top 5 breakfast places in all of LA and certainly #1 in the area.</review>< Pics>

Classic, "hole in the wall" diner/deli nestled in the heart of Beverly Hills. Nothing fancy, just hardy fare. Great chicken soup!</review>

<text>I like this diner / coffee shop. I always ordered the veggie burger with french fries. it was good and the french fries are good to. also the coffee is hot and fresh. there is always a crowd. most times I had to wait because this place Is so popular. I was watching the travel channel and I was like oh snap I use to eat there often. there is free parking not far up to 2 hours in the public parking garages im not sure before 6:00 p.m. I suggest trying this coffee shop if you can get a table.< /text><name>john smith< /name>< response>

$17.50 for 2 pieces of bread, tuna and a slice of cheese and a bit of oversalted potato on the side. $10 for 2 matzo balls and chicken broth. I used to come here monthly. Their matzo ball soup had lovely egg noodles, matzo balls and a chicken broth with carrots. My how times have changed. Now its just 2 matzo balls and chicken broth. Nothing like they advertise. I got my order to go and didn't notice till I had driven 40 min home or I would have sent it back. A little over $29 spent here for an extremely disappointing meal.<//Text>

MY LAST MEAL WILL BE HERE. Los Angeles, Jewish Delicatessen SUPERIOR to nyc. RYE BREAD is proper. CORNED BEEF, PASTRAMI &BROWN GRAVY are fit for a king. HALF-DONES & PICKLES are complimentary& PERFECT. Sublime, mellow CHICKEN LIVER. Perfect STEAK FRIES & COLE SLAW. Nate'n Al is a FINE-DINING establishment. If your bill is HIGH; GOOD!<//text>

< Review>
LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!
I  used to get my hair done a few blocks away and they ordered from here and offered me a sandwich one day and I declined  because (A)... I'm not much of a tuna eater and (B) ... I do not like a lot of meat of any kind  in a sandwich and that sandwich needed it's own thickness zip code (C) ... I'm not a deli eater I never ate at one before. So that right there's 3 good  reasons why I was not interested. "HOWEVER" when I declined the entire place of about 20+ people all got quiet and they looked at me as if I committed some crime then someone said... "Have you ever had Nate N Al's before?'' I replied "No". Well lets just say I caused somewhat of a mini riot and  was completely given the run down on why never to refuse a Nate N Al's " sandwich.  UGH ...OK OK ! I said and took the sandwich to shut everyone up basically . At this point you can hear a needle drop as they all were looking at me I was given a Tuna sandwich and I thought this is not gonna end well and they're all gonna send me into a cornfield cause I know I'm not going to like it.  So I held my breath  and reluctantly bit the sandwich  and everything I thought in my A.B.C the 3 reasons why not to just flew out the window and everything I once believed died just like that right there!  I mean wow  I just bit into the best freaking sandwich I've ever had in my LIFE EVER ... YES MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!  So the next day I went to pick up my mom and told her we're going to have tuna sandwiches at Nate N Al's for lunch and she thought I went crazy and  said Tuna sandwiches, Why would I want a tuna sandwich?
"Mom this time you have to just go long with me  you know I'm a picky eater so it will be good I promise and for good measure  I picked up my 20 year old daughter who thought me and my mom both went crazy .Needless to say I ordered all our food 3 tuna sandwich plates and a soon as they bit into theirs they looked at me with big eyes and said OMG THIS IS SO FREAKING GOOD yeah both of them along with saying it was the best sandwich they ever had in their lives. I'm not sure how they do it but you can't replicate that sandwich!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AND TRY THE TUNA IF YOUR NOT ALLERGIC YOU WILL BECOME A FAN! THANKS NATE N AL'S YOU PEOPLE KILLED IT BEST SANDWICH ON THE PLANET EVER  MADE PERIOD!!!!!!!<//Review>

Great, solid all american breakfast, quick & hot, plenty of coffee.

A nice break from the over prepared fare at most of the other restaurants we've been to in the area.

Enjoy!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The Matzoh ball soup here is hot, filling, and pretty inexpensive for the neighborhood. I also used to enjoy getting the basic breakfast plate, but I would have potato pancakes instead of hash browns. Wish more restaurants did that!<//Review>< pics>

Its like an old aging uncle you have, friendly yet aged. The food is great #19 is the sandwich to eat. Busy with short to long waits, amazing staff that has been there for year and years. Parking at Crate and Barrel building 2 hours free. few outside tables, all in all, an LA Landmark to experience</Text>

<time>1475433551219<//time><Rating>3</Rating><Review>A solid, if not touristy, Jewish style deli in the heart of Beverly Hills.

An overwhelmingly extensive menu of all the best Jewish style foods... chicken soup with matzo balls or kreplach, smoked fish and bagels, liver, pastrami, etc. And the pickles! I just want plates and plates of them.

The appetizer platters seem to be the way to go. Alone they are tons of food.. the fish of your choice served with tomato, onion, lettuce, cream cheese, and bagel. Their fish was great for an offering outside of NY.

I found the latkes disappointing, boiled potatoes instead of shredded, and not enough onion. Too thick, not crispy. But served properly with your choice of apple sauce and/or sour cream. The chicken soup had humongous matzo balls but came with pasta instead of vegetables or chicken, and definitely needed salt and pepper.

I'll have to come back to try the sandwiches!</Review>< pics>

Classic deli in LA. The food is typical deli food. Creamed herring is delicious as are the bagel and fish platters, sandwiches and soups. They have the sit down restaurant part, and the deli counter (separate).  You can order in advance and pick it up.</Review>

It's a deli and the food is on par with any other deli. But the location is terrible, it's in Beverly hills (yuck!). So unless you can tolerate Beverly hills and it's denizens I'd suggest going elsewhere.</text>

$18.50 for a dry turkey sandwich on 2 slices of crumbling wheat bread? Never again! Save ur money and go to Subway two blocks away. Large portions....almost as much as Subway.<//Text>

Worst costumer service behind the counter. Got a ticket and waited for 10 min not even one person said I'll be right with you or anything . Was elderly woman  behind me and was rolling her eyes too so I said screw this going to order my dinner somewhere else . Never again I'll put a foot in there cuz this is not the first time this happened I wanted to give another shot but it's the same that means the people up high in there dont give a damn</Review>

I was craving a pastrami sandwich and found this place, I'm definitely happy I decided to come here!
It was pretty empty when my boyfriend and I went for lunch. Service was great. Our server was so wonderful and really made the experience better. She was so cheery and happy!

I got the pastrami sandwich on rye. Exactly what I wanted. It was so good!! I also got a latke which I haven't had since I was little. So good!! Great with their applesauce too, yummmmmmmy.

I want to come back for their matzo ball soup, I've heard only good things about it.
Wonderful Jewish deli and delicious pastrami. Definitely would recommend!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Stopped in the other day and waited at the deli counter for 10 mins without any acknowledgment from those behind the counter or those serving the dine-in.  Asked a server if at that time it was only the 2 gentlemen working the counter and she turned around, looked at them and told me that they must be filling an order.  I chose wait still and after another few unacknowledged moments I went to the cashier and asked if there was anyone else working to which she replied...They're really busy but they'll get to you soon.  Well soon never came because when I went back one of the men was finally taking the order of the man before me yet still didn't even give me a courtesy nod, so I left.  But since there are only  a few places in the area where you can grab something quickly I stupidly returned to the scene of the crime a few days later, but this time I thought I would be smart and call first.  I was told there was a call before me and I was placed on hold...so far so good...until a man, who sounded like I was interrupting whatever he was doing, picked up the phone to take my order.  I asked that my order be ready by 2p, now it was 1:40p when I called and I was told very rudely that it would take 30-35 mins and I was only giving him 20 mins.  Keep in mind he hadn't even asked what I wanted before telling me it would be 30-35 mins.  I told him that I just wanted 2 matzo balls, no soup and I questioned why it would take so long.  He asked me in a less than pleasant tone if that was all I wanted and I told him to add a can of soda.  He said, OK and then hung up the phone.  For a place that prides themselves on being a great place to eat perhaps they need to pride themselves on better customer service because each and every time I have gone, and it's been more than just these past 2, the service is lackluster and non existant.  So as much as I love a good matzo ball, and theirs lack the shmaltz that gives it the flavor, I will find them else where.<//text>

Just an amazing meal. I had the Ruben sandwich and it was out of this world. I mean it. Best Ruben on the west coast.</text>

a classic since 1945. old school deli with to-go counter and large dine-in restaurant. bagels, lox, schmears, soft, double-baked rye bread, pumpernickel, corned beef, brisket, pastrami, cole slaw, knishes, potato pancakes, blintzes, ruggula, Dr. Brown's sodas, breakfast, lunch, dinner, meal and sandwich combos galore. Everything fresh, everything nostalgic of old NY delis of the bygone era, ys, Nate and Al's has outlived the Carnegie Deli and so many others, and it's still going strong in the heart of Beverly Hills.< /Text>

They offer a fresh and tasty reuben in the standard corned beef or pastrami varieties (I split half of each with my nephew, since the only half-n-half they offer is stacked, not separated), but I felt that it fell far short of the online hype it enjoys.  For a "celebrated" delicatessen, I was rather disappointed.  It was good, but not fantastic.  The size of the stacking was equally unimpressive.  A regular corned beef sandwich I saw go by was much more generously stacked.  It was my first experience here, so perhaps this was a fluke, but I have to go by what I'm given and, although the service was good, I won't bother returning for another reuben.  Rather underwhelming in general.< /Text>

<review>Everytime  come here, I imagine what it was like years ago.  I become silent & in awe of this establishment's participation in L.A. history.  On a Sunday morning, this place is bustling & there's always a line for seating & at the register.  There is free street parking nearby until 11am or 12pm on a Sunday.

I ordered takeout: the half portion of corned beef w/ Russian dressing, lettuce, & tomato.  I also ordered 1 pint of Kreplach soup.  Service was fast.  Everything was good.< /review><gmapID>0x80c2bc07990d2ebd:0xf1a793d3a7764bdb< /gmapID>< date>

I love delis and been to them all in New York and I keep coming back to Nate and Als when I visit Los Angeles. The New York is my personal favorite from the sandwhich board, pastrami, coleslaw, Russian Dressing add swiss, mouth watering! Michelle with the blue glasses was a wonderful server and suggested the hash browns with the Smoked Salmon Benedict.<//text>

Absolutely love this BH institution that attracts all sorts of characters from all socio-economic backgrounds. The wait staff are all so friendly, even if they get into domestics with eachother haha! Bagels, Lox and Rubens are all amazing here but the Onion Rings are the GOAT!</review>

<Review>I always want to be fair, but I simply thought this place was a total disaster. Its very tired, matching the unfriendly miserable wait staff and maybe the biggest offense: dry pastrami. How is that even possible?  My Jewish uncle suggested this was the "best jewish deli" this side of the pecos. Obviously he is blind and has no taste buds...  Sorry Nate n' Al its time to hang it up.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Why are diners so dark? They're from the past century.
I'm glad I ate.
The nice thing is that Michael Douglas was eating at the restaurant, but we didn't notice because he didn't come in with an air like ours. Only our American friend noticed, he said it when he got out.

(Original)
Diner lar neden bu kadar karanlık? Geçmiş yüzyıldan kalma haldeler.
Yediklerimden memnun kaldım.
İşin hoş tarafı Micheal Douglas ta yemekteymiş ama bizimkiler gibi bir hava ile girmediği için fark etmedik. Sadece  Amerikalı arkadaşımız farketmiş, çıkınca söyledi.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Food is always a guarantee here, the pastrami is really very good, but I recommend trying the burgers too. The service depends on the waiters. However, I highly recommend coming to eat if you are in Beverly hills and looking for a deli.
