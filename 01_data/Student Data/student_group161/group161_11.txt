We came to this place for lunch. This place was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, we were not disappointed. The staff members welcomed us with a smile and we had a fantastic feeling. The food was just great. We had a great time and we will visit this place again. Recommended.<//Text>

<Text>Just ordered through door dash. This is the first time I've taken the time to write a review. I'm very leary of trying new restaurants but this was absolutely fantastic!!!!! So glad I tried them and will order again. The egg foo young was huge and absolutely amazing. The gravy was just a tiny salty. Best chow fun ever and they made it exactly how I asked them to. Honey walnut chicken, WOW. So happy!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809ade9f3f4e80d3:0x91ab3091fef384ee<//Gmap_id>< Name>

They’re my gold standard for flavorful, inexpensive Chinese food. The hot and sour soup sucked. All heat, no spice, too thick. The steamed rice was overcooked, and the sesame chicken was slimy. Not the sauce, the chicken itself. Even the tea didn’t taste right. Not real green or oolong. On top of that, came in during lunch with literally no one else there, and the waitress hurried us through our entire meal. It was weird, and I won’t be back.< /Text>< pics>

I love this restaurant always good... I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants in Sacramento and this is the one I go back to... I recommend the chicken rice noodles they are so good.. Green bean chicken with black bean sauce.. Fried prawns...n I sometimes get orange chicken or sweet n sour chicken but with the sauce on the side so every bite is crispy...The owners have always been so nice n they always help u even when you ask for a substitution or if you don't like something you can just let them know and they will leave it out... I love it... Hot n sour soup n egg flower is bomb n fresh... Try it!!!</Text>

<Review>Their dishes are flavoraful and delicious. That is coming from an Asian who knows. They give large portions with plenty of chicken, pork, beef and seafood in the dishes. The meat are always lean without fat like other restaurants. Never been disappointed with any meals. Service is fast for take outs and in restaurant alike. My favorite go to Chinese Restaurant.<//Review>< Pictures>

This is one of my favorite restaurants. I love the chicken chow mein and the orange chicken. My favorite time to go is on during the lunch special because it is a good deal and comes with soup and an egg role. I highly recommend this restaurant.< /review>

If you know how to order Szechuan food rather than Americanized Chinese that's sweet, fried and boring then come here and don't order off just the big menu. But a few things are too good to pass on. Order Pot Stickers, made fresh, in house and taste like it (not like a trip to Costco's freezer was made) but an improvement would be Red Wine Vinegar. Egg Rolls made correctly. Fried Wontons, best I've found and kids will love them. Hot & Sour, Chicken & Corn, Wor Won Ton & Seafood soups  warm you on any winter night (just a touch of white "NOT BLACK" pepper in broth soups changes everything for the good). If you still eat meat then Tangerine Chicken, Cumin Beef & Yu-Shiang Pork are a must.

Now the good stuff like Kung Pao Fish, Salt & Pepper Fish w/Green Beans, Hot Braised Tofu & Garlic Eggplant w/Tofu. Fried Rice? WHY? Just get something worthwhile like Seafood Chow Fun or Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles. You want plain rice for dishes w/sauce anyway, or your just killing the flavor of dishes you ordered because you like the sauce.

1, 2 or 3 ratings will go up to 4 or higher if you low raters will come back and try the Szechuan menu. Ask for the little menu, and liking heat is a requirement. Ask questions before ordering something, heat can be turned down if you just ask. Like salt, you can add but can't remove. It's just like when you first went for Thai and learned the heat levels that you liked. But in Szechuan the chefs make it as it has been made for centuries. So it's your job to say hold some on the heat, not there's to inquire what you want. Work together and all will be happy and great food will come to your table.

As to what to order, Try doing this, order a meal that you know will be enjoyed. Then order one dish that's new for you from the Szechuan menu or the other each trip. That way you aren't wasting any big amount, just spending a little and hopefully expanding your palate on something new. But there are things that you just have to try. Dan Dan Noodles are great and HOT! Kimchi is a dream.

I don't eat much in meat anymore, except I'm curious and tried the intestines. I was surprised and liked the dish. I would have them again, but I dine alone and I want more than a dish for dinner, so next time I'll want others with me who are willing. There are a few things I've tried and liked in meat, most are on both menus and I've stated them already. That said, try the Chicken or Fish Hot Pots (SO GOOD).

This next item has been taken off the new menu I saw, and asked why. It's because nobody orders it. Please ask if they will make you the Double Cooked Fish and maybe we can get it back on. I can only order if others are with me. It feeds three easy and I'm generally alone, leftover fish from any place "NO THANKS". So I'm careful in what I order. But this dish is worth eating leftovers for once in awhile. It's really that good if you like fish. I love fish so this menu is great because there is more fish than shrimp on it. The big menu has all the shrimp dishes. ENJOY!

So please don't bad mouth the place till you learn what is being brought to Sacramento that's not available much, if at all. Local mom & pops need us, new owners are just that, NEW. We are there teachers as much as they teach us what's new. If we all learn to talk and hear, our little world gets better. The Corp. chains don't care about us, just our wallets. Perhaps what is needed is for another chef who cooks Cantonese and/or Mandarin shows the Szechuan chefs what's wrong in the cooking of these foods.

Make sure someone with power knows you expected different, why this is unexceptable. Ask why the difference. Tell them this time to please remove it off your bill (Don't eat half first). Then say you'll try them and the dish again and hope things improved. If same then they lose your business and you will write poor reviews on several sites. This is your power.

It's our neighborhood. If we support mom & pops, then we should be heard and told without attitude "BOTH WAYS" why something can or cannot change.

Will the corporations do that?< /review>

Portions are large. #4 adults including drinks $60.00. We will be back! Friendly with great service. I recommend the beef chow fun,  broccoli and beef and sesame chicken.<//review></record>

Food not bad. Egg rolls flaky and very good
Mongolian beef tasty and best of all consistently tender throughout

Sometimes things change for the better. This was my families once a month go to place for Chinese food but the owners apparently swap with owners of another restaurant now and then. Not sure the details but in a few short months we have come to realize this isn't our go to place anymore. The quality has slipped and the new team still seems to be struggling with getting their bearings. Time to try new places.< /text>

I ordered several dishes for me and my family and all of them were bland. The shrimp in the shrimp fried rice tasted horribly fishy and it was chewy and overcooked. Don't waste your time and money eating from this restaurant. I know I won't ever again.< /text>

I thought that was pretty rude me being a customer that use to like eating there but i guess somebody
has to pay for the ugly remodel of the restaurant , will never eat at this place again.< /review>< pictures>

This really breaks my heart to have to give only one star to this restaurant. I started dining at The Orient when it first opened years ago. The food was great the owners were nice it was like a mom and pop restaurant. However, recently we had food that was delivered that was not to our liking. We let it slide and just chalked it up to maybe there was a new cook. So, on Friday night we went in to order takeout to make sure they were clear as to what we ordered would be correct. For starters the initial person that helped us could not understand English. Then a second person came out and had just as much of a problem understanding and speaking English as the first person. We went ahead and tried to place an order  hoping they would get it right. Well, I made the huge mistake of not checking our food before we left. Of course when we got home and checked out our food it was not correct. And to add fuel to the fire the food was terrible! So bottom line we paid a lot of money for terrible food. We later found out that the original owners had sold the business. I think in order to get the food right the people that work there must understand English. Maybe the new owner should offer their employees an ESL class? Just saying....</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I frequented this restaurant many years ago and really enjoyed the Orient Restaurant. Tried it tonight and found it profoundly disappointing. I had General chicken and chicken fried rice. The General chicken was bland, rubbery without the normal spicy bite that the dish is supposed to provide.  The rice was equally disappointing, sticky and tasteless. Sad.<//Review>< pics>

It was all a total disaster. I asked for hot mustard and everything hot. What I go was like 12 soy sauce packets, one hot mustard. one sweet and sour and nothing else. This was for a six people meal. This is a fu**ing shame for all involved. I have pushed this food for so long and now I'm so disappointed that I  (and my friends) will never deal with this restaurant again!< /review>

So we wanted a LAF chaise and RAF couch.  When we put in the order Tim couldn’t figure out how to switch it to that, nor could anyone else in the store. When they couldn’t figure it out they told us to to have it assembled the way we want.  That didn’t sound right but I was rushed for time.  The next day I was highly suspicious that they just made that up to make a sale.  So I called customer service and they confirmed that it needs to be ordered correctly and not assembled later to specifications we needed.  They said we needed to call the store.  So I called the store number.  Well that just directed me back to the Ashley call center! And they told me to call the store!I explained to them what was happening and they would contact me later that day to confirm the change.  Guess what no one called me! So now I don’t know what I’m going to get.  I have zero confidence in The Ashley sales team and corporate doesn’t care.  I hope you have a better experience, good luck!< /Text>

Dayna was great. She didn’t pressure us but was attentive to us and ready to help us place an order. We went in to just buy a hutch and left with that, sofa and loveseat. They had a 50% of sale. Loved the experience< /Text>

I am very pleased with the purchase and the customer service to keep me posted on my items being shipped. The store on Blossom Hill sales person was amazing and was able to assist with my questions and made the purchase very pleasant. Even the manager's were professional and pleasant. I will definitely go back to the furniture store.<//Text>

My husband and I went to Ashley on Blossom Hill on Saturday. We were attended by Tony, a kind, cordial and warm person. Tony made the task of choosing a living room set easier ... there are so many options in the store. Overall it was a great experience.< /Text>

<Text>My family and I recently made our 2nd huge purchase at this store and I am nothing short of happy and satisfied!! Thanks to Gina the manager she was extremely helpful when it came to making sure my family and I left the store happy without breaking our pockets. I love that she wasn't money hungry or just trying to push a sale. She was extremely friendly and patient. As a manager she truly went above and beyond her duties.. she gave me advice on which furniture pieces would look nice that would fit my family and had a lot of patience with us. From beginning to the end she made our shopping experience so stress free and I truly appreciate that!!< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Read about other negative reviews on here. I should've listen to their advice. Don't make the mistakes. Ordered 3 chairs, 2 were damaged. Getting a hold of "Customer Care" is a pain. Once you do, they won't do anything until they send a tech out. Next avaliable appointment for the tech to just look at the problem is a month from now.

Other companies would just give you a product exchange. Ashley makes you keep the damaged product and for them to come out to attempt to repair the product. I wanted new chairs, not damaged repaired chairs.

Edit 05/12/21 update:
Technician arrived to make the replacement on the barstools. When they opened the replacement seat cushions there was damaged on both of them. Noticeably large scratches on the frame of the seat.

They're ordering 2 more replacements and I have an upcoming appointment in 3 weeks from now. Hopefully those seat cushions don't arrive damage either.

More to follow..</review>< Rating>

1. Ordered a dresser,mirror in store.
2. They took it to a wrong address(old one i had my last product delivered). Eventhough i had corrected the address when buying the dresser in store.
3. I took the initiative and called into dispatch/delivery to set it right as i realized from a last text message which mentioned address. All previous text alerts do no have address.
4. Now, brought to a correct address - order is wrong. They brought only dresser and i have been told this is the only one. I was advised in-store to not accept delivery if item is wrong because that is a hassle to recover from. So, i had provided info that item was wrong and so the item was taken back.
5. Its been close to a week, i have made a bunch of calls and left 2 voicemails and still yet to get my correct item.

Product number 2: Couch
1. Bought a couch with recliners/charge plugs ~40days ago.
2. Charge plugs do not work. I scheduled a service,waited for ~20days and Service that i have been provided is: Checks if the wire is plugged. and the conclusion is plug set does not work.
3. Then i have been told to wait for a week to get the replacement plugset delivered to my home and call Again to reschedule Another service to get the item installed.</Review>< pics>

This has been the worst customer service experience ever. Employee put in the wrong item on our transaction and store manager refuses to call us back and take responsibility. All we wanted was the correct item. Have tried calling the store but no one picks up.

I wish someone would have told me this place has the worst customer service ever. At this point I just want a full refund. Take your business elsewhere. This place is the worst. It doesn’t take 3 weeks to call someone back.</text>

Love the couch! Don’t love the service nor the “protection plan”. Long story short, my couch was delivered with an oil stain and damage to the arm rest and it was a HUGE pain to try and get it repaired. After dozens of phone calls, emails, two store visits, three technician visits, and finally an exchange visit over the course of 15 months, the issue has been resolved. Truly some of the most frustrating and complicated customer service I have ever experienced.

Shout out to Rebecca S. from online support who FINALLY was able to book me that couch exchange appointment and get me a new couch.</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I had the worst ever shopping experience with Ashley, will never shop with it in my life. I bought a sofa set on July 4th, was scheduled to delivered on 8/17. We understood the situation and agreed.  However, two days prior to 8/17, they called me with a new date on 8/21.  Then later another date on 9/2. On the day of 9/2, they called me saying the truck was broken down, needed to reschedule to 9/5.  Then on 9/4 they called me again said they run out of the sofa set and the earliest date was 9/12.  On 9/11 they called with to confirm 8-12pm delivery on 9/12.  Today is 9/12, nobody showed up, I called them at 1pm, they told me the shipment was cancelled and the earliest new date as of now is 10/1.   Haha, the date is moving smoothly toward the end of 2020.  I will never trust them and how they treat customers is really eye-opening, never heard of. Ashely is not trustable! To them, customers do not matter at all!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>worst customer service I had a dinning table delivered yesterday and the delivery guys didn't even wait for me to inspect the table or sign
a delivery receipt. as soon as they left I saw couple scratches and peeling wood, I called Ashleys customer service and they said I have to call the store, then called the store and was on hold for ever so I decided to drive
there instead, the guy in customer service said he will open a case to do a swap they will pickup the table and deliver a new table but he can't submit the case till tomorrow so he will call me in the morning to give me the confirmation which he never did so I called again and was told he never opened a case or started anything. now they're telling me they have
to send a tech to inspect it not just swap the tables. this is probably is going to take month to get this solved. I ordered from wayfair and overstock and their customer service is excellent and fast. never again from Ashleys.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Ashley has to have the worst delivery service ever. My dining table was set to be delivered on 11/2 and we waited all day and no table. No phone call. No email. No form of communication AT ALL to let us know why. They confirmed with my husband 4 different times that we would be home and still didn’t show up. Y’all have to work on your delivery service, cause right now it’s ridiculous.<//Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>My sleeper sofa was supposed to be delivered today only for me to call and check in just in case, to be told that delivery has been pushed 12 more days. I did not receive a call or email on that update...which is extremely unprofessional. I would have been fine with the delay if they were professional enough to let me know ahead of time and not have me move my schedule around this delivery. When I try to probe to get more answers all they say is sorry I don’t know why you weren’t informed. I’m highly disappointed<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

<text>I was in the excellent hands of David Trinidad who I highly recommend.  No hassle, no high pressure sales, just questions about your needs and what they have that can fit them.  Also Shout out to Manager David who assisted with payment and financing.  Completely painless experience.</text>< UserId.>

<username>Claudia Esparza< /username><time>1601693764299< /time><rating>1< /rating><Text>Very unsatisfied with the process of my delivery. If I could rate the company  0's stars I would. I bought my furniture well in advance since I recently moved out of San Jose and knew there were delays due to COVID. I was informed my dining set and living room set would arrive within a month after my purchase. The day before my furniture was scheduled to arrive I was giving notice that my dining table was out of stock and would received a call within 3 days after my first delivery. More than 3 days passed and I did not receive I call. I had to physical go into this store because I was  put on hold when I called the corporate number or corporate would hang up on me. When I walked into the store I was later informed the reason why my table did not make it with my first delivery date which they explained  the warehouse gave my table to another client. I have came into the store multiple times asking for updates of my delivery date because the staff in the front kept giving me different dates and they mentioned corporate would not respond to their emails. This has been so frustrating to say the least.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Purchased furniture from this store 2 months ago. They trick customers by giving earlier delivery dates and then as you are approaching the delivery date. They call 1 or 2 days before delivery date - saying you wont get the furniture for next 2 weeks. They have already delayed my furniture by a month with no explanation on why they call 1 or 2 days before the actually delivery date.

Worst furniture store brand ever. !!!!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>BEYOND WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! Spent $6,000 cash and still No one has replaced my damaged headboard and it’s been over 3 months. I keep calling and asking even showing up to the store to speak to an associate or manager. Every time I show up after waiting to talk to someone usually about 30-45 minutes they tell me someone will call me to schedule a delivery. Till this day NO ONE HAS CALLED ME! I am currently at the store right now as I write this. I arrived at 2:00pm and it is now 2:30 and manager keeps telling me to wait that he’s busy helping someone.
I will NEVER recommend anyone to buy from Ashley’s furniture. I am so disappointed and it was such a horrible investment. This place is the WORST!
To top off everything no one can give me a straight answer.
I will continue waiting in hopes that someone can assist me.</review>< Pics>

I don’t usually do these, but the service we got with Chris was awesome, so I’ll keep it short & sweet.

Came in looking with my girlfriend for some new furniture for our new place. With Chris’s help we found everything we were looking for and more. He wasn’t pushy, just extremely helpful when we were ready to pick the things we wanted. He explained everything clearly & helped us get the best delivery date we could.

Overall, highly recommended experience. Thanks again Chris!< /text>

Me and my husband absolutely love coming here. Dang has helped us furnish our new place on three occasions now. He’s never pushy, always humble and very honest which is why we like coming here. It’s also reassuring to know we are buying high quality furniture. Again Dang is amazing and we are now lifelong customers!<//Review>

I went here on their grand opening day to purchase a sectional couch and dining table that my girlfriend and I saw in one of their mail advertisements. Chris assisted us with our purchase and made the experience extremely smooth and quick. I like to walk into stores with an idea of what I want instead of looking around and browsing. As soon as I told him what I wanted, he went to work searching the inventory and then explaining the delivery process to me.

Chris was friendly, sharp, efficient, and got us in an out of the store in less then 30 while providing stellar customer service. I would highly recommend him to any of my friends or family. I will be returning for another purchase soon for a kitchen island and I’ll be visiting him again.</review>

<Review>I have had bad experiences in the past with Ashley Furniture in Milpitas . I went to San Jose store hoping service would be better. Gina and Lia helped me with my order. Before my purchases I went back many times and they were very patient.  I purchased a couch and a dining table . I am so happy with the service and the great deal that Gina - store manager gave me . I recommend San Jose Ashley better than Milpitas.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>BUYER BEWARE! DON'T DO IT

We purchased a table and 6 chairs on January 18th. They were delivered on the 23rd, and all of the chairs were unwrapped and out of the box. Each of the chairs had a defect including scraped leather seats, dings on the dark wood legs, scratches, punctures in the seats, as well as most of the chairs being wobbly. When I asked the delivery crew if I should just refuse the shipment due to the poor condition of the chairs, they instructed me that I should accept the chairs, and they would get someone out right away to replace them. I then found out that I would have to wait for a technician to come out and evaluate the chairs to see if they were eligible for replacement. There were no available technician appointments for another 2 weeks after the delivery date. I accepted the next available technician appointment, and got a call the day before to inform me of the time window. The time window was during the day, and no one would be at home, so I called to try to reschedule the appointment, and was told there was no available appointments for more than a week. I told them to keep the original appointment. They then called the next day and informed that the original appointment had been cancelled and I would have to wait another week to get someone out there. I went into the store in person and spoke with the manager, and he told me there was nothing he could do until the technician came out to look at the damaged merchandise, and at that time he would be able to replace them for me. By good fortune, the technician showed up at the originally scheduled time despite them telling me that the appointment had been canceled. The technician looked at the chairs and stated that every single one of them would need additional parts in order to repair, and that we were better off just getting new ones instead of trying to fix all six of the damaged chairs. The technician said that someone would call us within a few days to schedule the delivery of the new chairs and pick up the old ones. I then got a call from Ashley trying to schedule another technician appointment. When I called back. I was informed that the original technician said we refused to have the chairs repaired, and that they would need to send a technician out to try to repair them, even though the original technician agreed that they were to be replaced. I called back again, and after waiting on hold for 30 minutes, was told that in my account notes, the technician said that we refused repair. I tried escalating to a manager, and was told that the hold time would be 45 minutes to reach a manager. After waiting on hold more than an hour, my call was disconnected. I am so angry and frustrated right now, I plan to file a dispute with my credit card company and get my money back. Whatever you do, do not buy furniture from Ashley unless you want to be totally screwed over.

UPDATE: Two months after receiving defective merchandise and still not taken care of. Can't park in my garage due to storing merchandise for two months. No word from Ashley. This is a nightmare.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I will never buy from Ashley Furniture again.  I ordered a loveseat and table with a two week delivery date.  I received a text, email and phone call from their distribution center stating my furniture will be delivered as schedule.  On the scheduled delivery day no furniture showed up and no phone call from Ashley telling me why.  This happened two more times with their distribution center giving out delivery dates and no delivery happens.  When my items were finally delivered they delivered the wrong loveseat.  Another bad option with their distribution center is, when they call you to confirm your delivery date, if you don't answer the phone they will automatically reschedule your delivery time frame.  Then when you callback the distribution center, plan to be on hold for at least 30 minutes and once you do get someone on the line don't let them put you on hold, because you will be disconnected.  Terrible customer service.  Go to RC Willey if you can.<//Text>< Date>

I purchased a counter table (Item: D154-223) and a sofa (Item: 2070238) at Ashley's Homestore (Sales order number: 180070730) in San Jose on Friday July 17,2020. The sales rep. said that we could finance the furniture and so we applied and were approved with Genesis. Because of low staff, there was no one to help us out with the paperwork for the finance and so she said that there was no way to proceed with financing because the employee who took care of customers who were approved by Genesis was on leave so we decided to pay with 2 debit cards. On one of the debit cards they charged $1,000 and on the other one they charged $256.36 which in total was $1,256.36 including delivery and taxes. She also stated that the delivery of our furniture was going to be on 8/2/2020. We changed our minds after we had paid because it was going to take 2 weeks to get the furniture and we needed it as soon as possible. On Monday July 20,2020 we personally went to the same location of our purchase to cancel our order. The lady in customer service claimed that we should be receiving our refund in 3-10 business days. As of today August 10 ,2020 , 21 days have passed and we have still not received our refund. We went to the same location of our purchase and were given three numbers to call and 2 of those numbers didn't work and the Ashely's Homestore Corporate phone number left us on hold for one hour and 23 minutes to be exact just to have no response, no date of refund or any solution. Ashley's Homestore is completely unprofessional and clearly struggles to meet customer's satisfaction.<//text>

Ashley’s is one of the best places I’ve come to shop for furniture. The staff was so helpful and always on a move to help me look for what I needed. Out of all the amazing staff Dayna Chapman was our personal helping staff
Member and we couldn’t have the best set of furniture if it weren’t for her. She helped my family and I find the best ideal living room we were looking for. The assembly process was also successful they have people come in and assemble everything in your house. Definitely coming back here in the future for more furniture.< /Review>

Wow, wow, Wow! What else can I say! Chris was such a great help. He knew exactly what questions to ask to help me find the perfect couch! Financing was a breeze, and I'm now the proud new owner of a top tier sectional for a fraction of the cost. What a deal, and what a great experience from an amazing salesman.

< Review>
I am never ever buying from Ashley's Furniture  again. I ordered a dining room table, couch and coffee table. The first delivery everything BUT my dining room table came and we were not told in advance that we weren’t receiving it. After finally contacting someone they delivered my dining room table a week later ONLY to deliver the INCORRECT chairs. After getting transferred from warehouse to customer service to the corporate office to the store I went in to speak to a manager. The assistant manager HENRY was so RUDE yelling at me not once apologies and in turn, tells me he isn’t going to argue with me and this a 4 billion dollar company and this is how they run things. I am unable to schedule a THIRD delivery date to CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE until my pathetic $100 store credit memo gets processed. I spent over 2k on furniture and in return, I get tossed around on the phone, yelled at by the assistant manager and issued $100 store credit. AS IF I WOULD EVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.

Blossom Hill location management is awful. The manager continued to blame his employee and tell us how he is no longer with their company as if that is any of my business and or solves my problem. Henry was completely unprofessional and rude to raise his voice at me and to use a former employee as a scapegoat.< /Review>

Kabir was great at helping me find a chair to match the couch I wanted. He custom made a package to go with just what I needed with out costing me more on extra things. Definitely recommend him as a sales person. He’s patient and not pushy, which was great.</review>

<Review>Gina G has the best customer service ever! She showed us exactly what we were looking for and was never overwhelming with pushing us to make a purchase! With that being said, we bought what we needed and we will definitely be returning to purchase more with Gina and I have already shared our experience with my family and friends and highly recommend that they go see Gina at Ashley Furniture!</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808e336e87498e9d:0xdcae5d929d0a7dd2<//GmapID>< username>

Sales reps very nice, helpful. Dayna Chapman made my visits comfortable and had great insights to what I was looking for and needed in space I was shopping for. I liked the layout of your showrooms. The beautiful furniture and many choices could have made my choice difficult, but Dayna knowledge and advice made the process less difficult.</Text>

<review>Even though I didn’t purchase anything, I was very appreciative of the help provided by Chris. He was very knowledgeable about the beds I was looking at and he educated me on how best to make them last with my two crazy kids. Being in the holistic industry, I understand the importance of a good nights sleep and my current bed is not comfoI will be back to purchase.

If you go to this store, ask to work with Chris. He’s amazing (he also smells amazing)<//review>< pics>

<Text>We’re in the process of downsizing my grandmother from a two bedroom house to an assisted living 1B/1B. The team at the Blossom Hill store, specifically Unike and David, did an awesome job with my 92-year-old grandmother. They were patient and listen to exactly what she wanted for her new space. The store had plenty of options that would fit nicely into her new 525 square-foot apartment.  Thanks for the Blossom Hill team for all that they did! Five star service all the way around!< /Text>< pics>

Today my fiancé and I came in to Ashley’s in search of a bedroom set for our new home. We had the pleasure of working with Mr. Chris Barry during our search for the perfect bed. Chris was very knowledgeable and had good insight to share about all of our options. Chris showed us around and gave us some specific information on a bunch of different bedroom sets and then allowed us time to walk and talk about our thoughts on each option. We ultimately picked which set we wanted and Chris made the process quick and painless! We are definitely pleased with the customer service we recieved working with Chris and will be back to Ashley’s for future purchases!!
Thank you,
April< /Text>

We bought a new bed frame and mattress from Ashley almost 3 weeks ago. After waiting more than a week for the initial delivery, the bed frame they brought was damaged. The delivery person told me someone from the store would be reaching out to reschedule for a new bed frame and we would receive it within 2 days. Guess what? No one ever called to reschedule for the bed frame. I called and the manager was very rude, told me it would be another 5 days before anyone could come out, and basically berated me on the phone saying I shouldn’t trust what the delivery drivers say by the initial quote of 2 days. I paid for a product (bed frame and mattress) and a service (delivery and set up fees) and although the money was taken, Ashley still couldn’t follow through. Very disappointing. Our new bed frame was delivered finally this weekend (still 4 days after the broken frame despite much “effort” from the manager). I wish I could say the story ends here. The delivery driver drove his huge box truck into one of our trees in front of our house and caused one of the main limbs to crash into the street. He apologized and promised he would retrieve a hand saw from the warehouse and return to help cut it up for yard waste collection. Guess what? He never showed back up. I went to this Ashley store due to the good reviews on Google, but I can promise you that once they get your money they will never follow through on anything they “promise” whether it be the store manager, delivery driver, or salesperson. STEER CLEAR of this store and buy furniture elsewhere. This has been an absolute nightmare from the beginning.< /Review>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>If I could give this store negative stars, I would. On 06/17/2020 we bought a full bedroom set from this location. The store manager, David, did not give us a clear delivery date, but said that he would try to check with the warehouse and call us within 48 hours to let us know about the delivery date. Forty-eight hours went by and we didn’t receive any call. We tried calling the store several times but they wouldn’t pick up. We then decided to go to the store and see him. When we went there, he gave us a delivery date of July 8th. July 7th came and they called us to let us know that they don’t have all the pieces except for the nightstands and a few of the bed frame components. We told them that we would accept delivery of the nightstands, and when the other pieces came, they could deliver those pieces later. They promised that they would deliver the nightstands on Wednesday, July 8th. On July 8th, the day of the delivery, they call us in the morning, and tell us that they forgot to load the nightstands into their van, and there was nothing they could do about it because the van had already left. They promised to refund our delivery fee (which they have not refunded). However, they said they would deliver them on Friday, July 10th. July 10th comes and we hear nothing from them regarding the promised delivery. We called them, and they said they hadn’t scheduled a delivery for Friday, despite promising to do so on Wednesday, July 8th. The representative we spoke to said she was confused as to why they hadn’t delivered our items yet. She told us that a delivery date had now been set for Tuesday, July 14, and she said she would follow up with us on Monday, July 13. On July 13, no one called us regarding the items, as had been promised. We again called them, and were told the delivery date for the items is now August 1st. We asked to speak to a supervisor, who said her name was Collea. When we asked her why our delivery date keeps being pushed back, she told us the delivery date was now August 1st and hung up the phone, without any other explanation. What is going on with these people? They are supposed to be professionals and all they seem to be professional about is lying! David, you should be ashamed of how you lie to your customers, along with everyone that works at Ashley Home Store!    This was the first and the last time I purchase anything from Ashley, and I will make sure all my family and friends  never buy anything from you either, so they don’t have to go through what we did!< /Review></record>

<Text>First, I need to compliment UNIKE  She was extremely helpful and super patient with us-we didn't exactly know what we wanted.  She was there when we needed her, but didn't push (A Big Plus).  She was so sweet,  She deserves much praise.  Also, a shout out to David (My Birthday Bud) who was friendly and professional.  Can't say enough good things with this store.  Love the style and quality with the price!<//Text><Time>1568928412484</Time>< Rate>

Chris was phenomenal! We walked into Ashley’s on a whim to see their furniture. We were not expecting to walk out with anything, but let me tell ya we walked out with a great first experience and a deal we could not refuse. We took advantage of their Black Friday deal along with their financing program; we purchased an electric reclining couch and a rustic looking tv stand. Chris went above and beyond to get us the best possible deal on the furniture and he definitely did not let us down. In the end, we walked out as two really happy customers; we will for sure be back to buy more when we start renovating our bedrooms!<//Review>

<review>My fiancé and I came in a few hours before closing on a Sunday.  A salesperson, Gina, greeted us upon entry and offered us her assistance.  She gave us time and space to look around without making us feel pressured to make a decision or purchase.  When we were ready to purchase she completed our transaction swiftly.  Thanks so much, Gina! We can’t wait to receive our new couches!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>It was my 2nd visit,  I had already done my recon shopping. Im not a fan of shopping. There is a massive amount of massive furniture, and other. I just needed a couch. Sales people very nice and knowledgeable. Not pushy. That's why I went back. Purchased at Ashley. Delivery in a week!👍</Text>< pictures>

<Text>This store is one of the bests furniture store I’ve been at by far. We had the best sales person too, her name is Alexandra Venegas , she was there to help us with anything we needed & knew Exactly what we were looking for.  She was very patient with us as we were walking around undeceive & wasn’t scared to share her product knowledge & ideas. Definitely ask for her ! She is the best at what she does, & she does not follow you around pressuring you. She knows exactly when to check up on you & help you when you need her ☺️ Thanks to her I will be coming back here for more 👍🏻< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Tried the online experience, tried to call store directly,  spent 45 minutes waiting for anybody to answer.  Unless you walk into the store and corral a sales person, you will never get a question answered.  Just an FYI.  How important is customer service to you when you cant walk into the store.  I went locally and paid just a little more but when I had a question, they picked up the phone in 2 rings.</text>< Pics>

Came in today just looking for a desk and a tv stand for our living room and was warmly greeted by Kabir informing us of the sales in the store. After browsing for a bit we met with Chris and he explained the sales as well as the special discount going on for warranty too! Because of this we ended up getting a tv stand for our living room and bedroom, a bookshelf, a side table for our fish tank, a new table for our living room, and even treated ourselves to a great drink cart on sale! Chris was amazing helping us out with everything and we appreciate his time and patience with explaining pricing and setting up a delivery date. All the staff there was friendly too and we’re so glad this location opened up near by. Always recommend Ashley for their great service and will definitely be back for any other furniture needs! :)<//Text>

You have to check out the new Ashley store on Blossom Hill Road in San Jose and ask for CHRIS BERRY! When I entered, I was greeted with a welcoming smile from Chris. As I meandered towards the kids furniture department it was like walking into the Houzz app with a smorgasbord of decorating ideas tailored to each room of your house. When I entered the store I was pleasantly surprised to find outdoor furniture nestled along my walk towards the kids section. Chris asked what I was looking for, took out a pad of paper and sketched my Son’s dream room taking into account what I thought would be issues decorating it. Now here’s the best part for me ... when we went to look for mattresses for my Son’s new bed, Chris asked me “How I was sleeping?” Truthfully not well. After asking me all the right questions Chris custom fit me to an adjustable temper pedic mattress which had me feeling like I was sleeping on a cloud. I can’t wait for my new sets to be delivered! The icing on the cake was that he got me into 0% financing and my payment is less than my cell phone bill. I don’t enjoy shopping, but Chris made this whole experience amazing and stress free.<//review>

<review>Ashley Furniture continues to use a incompetent delivery service. We purchased furniture from the store 2 years ago. We were charged $100 for delivery. Not only did Jose fail to show up, he also failed to notify us. We waited all day. When Ashley's finally caught with him, he stated his truck broke down. We had decided never to shop at Ashley's again. Now 2 years later, we decided to give Ashley's another shot. Only to find after purchasing, Ashley's is still using the same incompetent delivery service. Again we were charged $100 for delivery, Jose again, failed to deliver our items without notification, and again stated his truck broke down. So now the issue is not Jose's incompetence, it's Ashley Furniture's failure to protect its customers. It is irresponsible for Ashley's Furniture to require us to pay for service knowing the have a history of incompetence. 2 years ago, we were promised a delivery refund which we never received. Today, we were promised the same. There is every indication this will be deja vu. While you're in the store the sales people are amazing, but receiving your furniture is a total disaster.<//review></record>

<Review>The worst service I've ever had. If you want to buy something and expect to be delivered on time, don't buy at this place. We bought a dining set and they didn't delivered in the day that was scheduled. Nobody even called to say they won't be delivering!!!!!! They sent a message some days before asking to confirm the delivery, I confirmed and even doing everything right they didn't delivered! Horrible experience !!!!!!! So desappointed! Customer service? Don't expect to have here!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I had a great experience at Ashley's in San Jose CA. I'm so glad I was greeted by Kabir Kalkat. He did an outstanding job answering all my questions. He is a very knowledgeable young man. I highly recommend him and San Jose store. I hope his management recognize his hard work and compensate him well.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>CHECK YELP RATINGS GUYS! IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

Horrible delivery and return service. I ordered and found a better deal then called to cancel within 2 hours of ordering. They say it is a direct ship so they can't cancel, instead they will request to cancel, and it shouldn't be a problem, asked me to call back next day to confirm. I did 2nd day and it is still pending, asking me to call again next day, the 3rd day the order started shipping(as I have UPS shipping notification turned on), I told them the order started shipping, they give me another number to call to cancel, saying it is the factory, that number redirects me back to this store, the store said no they can't do it I have to call that number - now I am in this loop instead of getting my problem resolved. I called more than 20 times and reached different people and eventually came to the shop. They said I can't return the product to the shop, it is a direct ship blablabla. Eventually I am fed up and called my credit card company to dispute the bill. 2 days later the store called us and said it is ok to return. The money is back to my card now. Would never want to shop here again.</text></record></dataset><record>

Great service at Store level once you finish your shopping the delivery is Horrible, schedule my delivery a month later on weekend to make sure I m free to receive my items, Truck got michanical issues! Do you even believe it in a rainy day? They call and schedule for next day exact same time frame without even confirming that you are available on that time frame, I call and ask them to at least schedule it between 8 to 12 and not 12 to 4 and they just argue it's the default.  My argument is that It's not my problem, you broke the promise and I don't have to sit and not go to work because of your delivery schedule. I went to store and store manager told me that he will get back to me and it is still no update. It's been 6 hours! There were few other costumers having exact same issue with their Items at store when I was visiting.<//Review>

We waited for delivery all day and it never came.  After a long time on hold we were told it had been canceled.  We got a new delivery schedule and verified that date.  We were notified the morning of the delivery date that the delivery was canceled again because sofa was damaged and no others in stock. We then found out that the earliest delivery date is a month away.  The biggest issue is total lack of communication and cooperation.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I just bought a sofa, a loveseat, and a table set. First off, the store manager, Henry, is the worst manager I have ever seen. We have received our orders 1 month later than what they promised. Henry’s employee promised us a store credit but he didn’t give and said I never promised. Besides, the table set quality is very bad. Finally, to be fair, sofa and loveseat quality are good but the fact that we received them very late is really annoying.< /Text>

<review>Disgusted and disappointed.. until the sale was done they were extremely patient and so nice to our faces.. and we spent almost $4000 for our furniture there.. deliveries all were messed up and it’s been almost 2 months and still not completed even after 5 deliveries, bcz they bring wrong ones bcz they have forgotten to put in specs like whether it’s a 2”/5” or 9” base for the bed..we purchased our furniture on the 14th of November and still not completed. Had to visit the store more than 6 times now and all they can say is I’m sorry and let me give you some credit.. worst story is about the sofa, it’s a beautiful sofa that we got from them but since they “forgot” to include the protection plan then, now they can’t do anything about it bcz apparently it has to be done during the first 10 days, which we had no clue bcz NO ONE INFORMED US! And there response is now we can’t do anything about, I’m sorry! Worst service and customer care.. extremely extremely frustrated!< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Attend Mass here off and on.  The choir is good, especially the soprano !! Love the priests here. I feel the people who attend could be a little more friendly, go out of their way a little more to make people who are visiting to feel more welcome.</Review>

I was a message to review this venue before visiting.
I have recently returned from California and a wedding at this church.
It is a modern church by my standards , but is a very well appointed place.
It has a very Average appearance for it's size .
But is a Very welcoming Church that said.< /text>

<name>Matthew Barba</name><text>Great place for fresh smoothies and other items like it. I have been coming here since the first day it opened. They customize my smoothies everytime and always get it right. They have a nice selection of fresh fruit and unlike most places they have honey. The establishment is very clean and the employees are always friendly!!!< /text></record>

<review>Omg! This is place is so tasty! Whole foods, yummy gluten free bread option and I loved the mix of flavors they have available. The mimosa was a charm coming with flowers. Please, if you want clean and tasty options, come check it out.<//review>< pics>

We ordered online and it was ready in 20-25minutes.

Acai #2- the toppings are delicious. The smoothie part was very watery.

Acai #6- The toppings but the smoothie part isn't very good. The peanut butter was overbearing.<//Text>

Favorite juice bar in SLO! Acai bowls, avocado toast, kombucha on tap and fresh juices in a pretty ascetic-- everything you could ask for. Staff can sometimes be slow so be prepared to wait but any wait is worth it!<//text>

<Review>This place is amazing for acai bowls! Great variety of toppings for the bowls too. Pro tip: get almond butter blended in to the Acai bowl for a thicker consistency. Can't wait to come back and try one of their chia seed puddings</Review>< resp>

<Text>The interior of the restaurant is a bit cramped, but the patio out back was peaceful and relaxing. I enjoyed all of the food, but the portion to price ratio seemed off. $8.50 for a single piece of toast is galling, no matter how tastefully presented and well-prepared. I guess despite the menu pictures, I expected it to be two pieces.<//Text><gmapID>0x80ecf1030265023d:0x8ed929c82b8ebfa0<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Just went there. Spent $9.50 for a smoothie- asked for 2 cups so my son and I could each have some- the girl filled each of our cups less than halfway - there was a lot left in the blender so the girl and her friend started drinking it. What the heck?!  Do not recommend. It wasn’t even good- tasted like pure orange juice. 👎🏼< /review>

Had a bowl(#6, to be exact) and it wasn't that great taste wise, mostly taste granola and coconut. And the WORST part (atleast for me) is how watered down it was.<//Review>

The place is cute and I really want to like it, but I wasn't too happy when I got something I wasn't expecting. I asked the girl that was helping me if there was coconut in the granola and she said no. I then asked her what bee pollen tastes like and she kind of stumbled over her words saying it doesn't taste of anything. (spoilers: bee pollen does have a taste) when I got my acai bowl and started eating it, all I could taste was coconut. It was a sad day for me.</Text>

< Review>
Because  is always  durty  and the  manager doesn't  care  maybe if you have  a proactive  manager who  cares  things  might be better in stead he blames the employees  and fire them when  he is the one who should  be  directing the employees  he is the one responsible  but  he is lazy and with a nasty  attitude  with the employees  and the customers  that attend  to the theater  he is arrogant  and belegerant  with the movie goers he needs to be removed  to a lower rank because  the  one he has is way too  much  for him  any employee  can do better  job than he specially  with the paying customers  he needs to be fired
Maybe sailing hot dogs in the  snack  bar will be  perfect  for someone  like that and as long he is in that position  Iy family  and  friends  won't come back to a such durty place< /Review>

Great selection. The young man who assisted me, Marvin, was very knowledgeable, attentive to my needs and I bought everything that I was looking for there. Super good prices too! Check them out if you need furniture!!</Text>

My husband and I had a great experience at Holbrook's.  We went in looking for a new mattress and ended up purchasing a new sofa and love seat too.  We were impressed with their selection and the prices were so reasonable.  We had our furniture delivered that same day - the delivery men even stayed late to make sure we got it to our house and got it set up.  We'll shop there next time we need furniture.</Text>

Update: Derek was amazingly helpful. I got an upgraded dresser and he even delivered the new one for me. Great management shift!

Over priced for the quality of product. The front of my dresser just popped off staples and all and I was sold it without all of the screws. For over $200 youd think I would have it for more than three months. Waste of money.<//review>

These guys were great. No hard sell. I bought a reclining couch. And, they returned the couch for full store credit after over a month when it just wasn't fitting me quite to my liking. They delivered and picked it up! Courteous and fair.<//text>

This store was a godsend to us, and the people who run it are wonderfully kind and helpful.  We went there after losing our home in Paradise and bought beds and furniture and they couldn't have been nicer.  They made us a great deal, were MORE than kind and sympathetic to our circumstances and loaded everything into our truck and car before I could even finish paying for it.  We will definitely be back!!< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1543819636926, 'text': 'It is easy to post a review full of lies and inconsistencies.  Such a shame that Google doesn\'t require proof before such outrageous claims can be made public. You waited "a few months" after the so-called fact and then at 10:30 on a Sunday night you write your one and only Google review to complain?  I don\'t believe for a minute that you were ever sold a used mattress that had  bed bugs.   I don\'t believe for a minute that you didn\'t demand a refund if you even THOUGHT that happened.  Contrary to your statement, we do give refunds. I don\'t believe for a minute that you ripped off tags from a supposedly bed bug infested mattress and saved them for "a few months" to write a review. I don\'t believe for a minute that the store owner told you all of the mattresses we sell are used, because they ARE NOT! I don\'t believe for a minute that you would let it go when supposedly you bought a mattress with bed bugs, were told you couldn\'t have a refund, and then never contact us again!!  You would just wait a few months and then write a review?   I do believe, however, that you own a certain competing store and are continuing your harassment game. This is getting old. Please stop.'}</Resp>< review>
Went to Holbrook’s a couple months back in the hopes of an inexpensive mattress. I found inexpensive but it was most definitely at the cost of the quality. Not even a full week into having the mattress, I started to notice countless bug bites all over my body. I started considering the possibilities of how I might have gotten them because I didn’t want to jump to the conclusion that the mattress gave me the BED BUGS (spoiler alert: it did). After arriving at the conclusion that it was in fact the mattress— this was after mulling over that I had been living in the same place for a year prior, none of my guests or neighbors had bed bugs, none of my house mates had bed bugs, and I hadn’t introduced any new furniture or used belongings that possibly could have had bed bugs— I gave Holbrook’s a call. I informed them of the situation and to my dismay, was “reaffirmed” by the store owner that all mattresses are certified and sanitized in a factory. Sidenote, the person I spoke with was also very rude, short, and payed no interest to the customers overall experience with his business. I was offered store credit as they don’t offer refunds but who in their right mind would buy again from a place that has bed bugs?
I’ve also just read a different review that accuses the store of having bed bugs where the owner commented something along the lines of “never ever having bed bugs.” Unfortunately, this is false and if I thought it was appropriate to attach photos of the bites I had covering my body after having the mattress for 2 days, I would.
Lastly, as I was taking the bed to the dump, I noticed some “used” labels. To my knowledge, the store does not advertise that their beds are used nor was I informed that I was getting a used mattress upon purchasing.

I’ve read through some of the other reviews and my experience does not seem to be unique. I’m writing this review in the hopes that customers won’t spend their money at a place that takes part is such poor business habits. If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.
(P.s this review is also on Yelp with some photos attached of the secondhand/used labels I found on the mattress)<//review>

<Text>We’ve been shopping at Holbrook’s furniture store for years now. I always love the special attention that we got from the assistant manager Derek (Who is now, I understand the new manager).  Whenever we didn’t find what we were looking for, Derek has always encouraged us to look through the catalog or their website.  Even now that we no longer live in Chico, we still order furniture through Holbrooks.  Last year we bought a vacation home and bought the majority of our furniture through one of the Holbrook websites.  Again we were so impressed with the professionalism and knowledge of Derek.
Their prices are very reasonable and the furniture is very well-made.  A delivery date was set and the truck arrived on time and was professionally unloaded and set up in our home.  I can’t recommend the store more.<//Text><userid>110843208727313615456< /userid><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I bought my first couch and bed from Holbrooks today, I am more than satisfied with the furniture, workers, and deal I got! Their workers were trustful and left in my cammed rooms alone while watching my cameras; they werent at all weird, didnt look around our rooms, listened to how/where I wanted everything, took my old furniture, and were very kind to my animals. I cannot wait to get more furniture here!!!!!</Text>< Pictures>

<review>We were greeted right away,  told Chris exactly what I was looking for, he showed me right away, and at the great prices they have, I was able to get a nightstand TOO 😊 absolutely love my Holbrooks. I won't go anywhere else for my furniture. And did I mention how AWESOME Chris was?? 😊 I will be back soon for my loveseat and rocking recliner. ☆☆☆☆☆< /review>< pictures>

Great furniture but the owners are very opinionated of who walks in the door and very quick to Judge by  appearances. Other then that the furniture quality is great & low priced. You get what you payed for.<//review>

I needed to buy a new dining table because the ex took the old one.  I went in to the Chico store and they had a nice one on the floor for a great price.  It had a little scrape of white paint on the side which they said they thought they could get off.  Sure enough they delivered it the next day and there was no trace of that little white paint.  Looked perfect.  So, this was the Chico store and an in stock item, but my experience was excellent.< /Text>

<review>I'm not real keen on holbrooks furniture store long time ago they sold to to upgrade Chester drawers to my mother one set for myself and one for my daughter and she bought two end tables her herself I think they were very overpriced the two dressers were $200 a piece and they're supposed to be a discount furniture store and then found out later that the furniture and dressers or particle board it didn't last very long time I was very disappointed I would not recommend anybody to holbrook's< /review>< pics>

If I were able to give this store less than one store I would. I was told a price on the phone so I drove the hour there for a specific item. When I got to the store the the manager who apparently is the second in charge for the holbrooks jacked the price up 3 hundred more dollars and told me tuff luck either purchase it at that price or leave. He was extremely rude and unprofessional. Totally had the im better than you attitude. I strongly suggest people to avoid this store. You are just a number with a wallet no customer care at all. Might as well purchase from a big chain store.DO NOT SUPPORT THIS STORE</text>

<Review>I ordered and paid for a couch on December 14th with the promise from Holbrooks that it would be delivered within 5 to 6 business days. I clarified that I needed the couch before Christmas because I have family coming over and only 2 chairs in my living room. I was promised it would be here in plenty of time. I called on the 22nd (the 6th business day after ordering) because I had not heard from them. They assured me that it would be on the truck coming on the 23rd and would be delivered either the afternoon of the 23rd or the 24th. I called again in the afternoon on the 23rd and they told me the truck was running late and it would definitely be delivered on the 24th between 12 and 4pm. I have received no phone calls and now it's after 4pm on Christmas eve and I still have no couch. They are closed so I'm assuming I will not have a couch tomorrow. I am pissed because I could have gotten a different couch in a second choice color from a different retailer. I should have done that :(<//Review><rating>2</rating>< Pics>

<review>Wow!  Floored by these criminals.  I went to help a neighbor with the issue and all I can say is WOW.  They refuse to give him his $700 deposit back and then tell him they are not giving them the furniture either.  Jim Maxxwell is the worst!!!  We are taking them to small claims court to get the money back...

I bought four chairs and waited almost a month for them.  I had to constantly call them and find out what was going on with the items purchased.  In addition, they are usually hours late on the delivery service which makes for a conflicting experience.< /Review>

Unless they actually have the furniture you want right there don't buy from them. They'll take 2-3 times longer to deliver then they quote you.<//text>

<Text>I have been eating here for the past two years and I absolutely love everything about this place! The Vegan options here are wide and so very delicious! My son also loves to eat here with me. We love the outdoor dining, it's so peaceful. Everyone is so kind and welcoming. We will continue to support Natural World Market Cafe!<//Text>< pics>

Delicious deserts and muffins, fantastic food. This natural organic Café is a neighborhood gem.  It is completely non-dairy and mostly vegan, but with specially sourced organic free range chicken options and add ons.
They have Venezuelan specialties, like arepas on the weekend, along with delicious bowls, tacos, salads, and breakfast options.
Google maps makes it a little hard to find with the correct address, but incorrect driving directions.
It is on the main street, but with parking behind.</Text>

The owner Rosa has been very helpful and carefully pays attention to needs in regards to health. I am a diabetic, she always asks specifically what ingredients I want and makes sugar free suggestions when it comes to orders. Definitely will be a loyal customer and support her business for she is a wise and very polite person. Definitely show this business some love and ofcourse keep healthy as possible . Peace and love 🙌< /review>

<text>This place is awesome! If you come on the weekend, they serve a Arepas, a traditional Venezuelan dish, kind of like a thick corn tortilla with all sorts of good stuff inside. It was SO GOOD! And they have a great little outdoor patio for safe dining during COVID. Great customer service! Come support a local business!<//text>< pictures>

I really like the Bob's Red Mill selections. They're one of my favorites! And they have a wide variety of them. A huge fresh selection of nuts and dried fruits in the bulk area with bulk spices too! A good-sized parking lot in the rear makes in and out visits convenient and you don't have to worry about Artesia traffic.
Perfect store for health nuts who like nuts!

I have been a healthy eater for years.  Unfortunately, healthy food and tasty food are not always the same thing......The food at this place is both wonderful tasting and healthy!  And did I mention the price is amazingly reasonable?  Their veggie burger is just wonderful!<//text>

Food (arepa) was ok, but getting it was painfully slow. There were no other food orders ahead of us or after us on a Saturday morning, and it took more than half an hour. Call ahead, otherwise I can't recommend it, and even then, it's good but not great (P.S. - adding to original review: the muffin that my wife brought home the following week was very good)<//review>

Amazing market & cafe with tons of healthy food and product selections.  Friendly staff, very clean and incredible aroma and natural feel. I had the breakfast sandwich special (tomato, vegan cheese, basil paste, avocado, etc.) and it was so awesome, definitely the best ever I had. You can park on the street or there's also abundant parking if you go around to the back street, so make sure you go check it out!! Great place!!</Review>

Very fresh and flavorful. Took one of the homemade gluten free pastries for snacking later 😋 It is also a market with high quality bulk items. Will be stopping by soon for a coffee and to grab some great baking staples.< /Review>< pictures>

Nice vibe here. Delicious food and friendly people. Had their veggie bowl with potatoes, it was really fresh I could tell they use top quality ingredients. Also got to sample the superfood smoothie which was amazing. The cafe has a clean and spacious seating area separate from the grocery area to enjoy a meal. If I lived nearby this would be my go-to place!< /Review>

Absolutely superb “fast” food. I ordered delivery from them today... the food came earlier than expected which was a pleasant surprise, but the food! I ordered a Buddha bowl and every component of the dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The dish has butternut squash in it... I cannot remember the last time I had perfectly and evenly cooked butternut squash from a fast/non high end restaurant setting, it was excellent. The broccoli and quinoa as well were evenly cooked and tender without being mushy. I did not find one hard grain of quinoa as is usually the case with “fast” restaurants (like True Food for example). Only gripe is the protein portion is on the smaller side, but probably enough for most people. Def check it out if you appreciate good food 👌</Review>

We do our best to provide high quality food with prices that are affordable. We use only Organic ingredients and everything is made in house from scratch. Our protein portion (Tofu/Chicken) in the Buddha Bowl is the recommended amount by nutritionist balanced with all the veggies. We are focused on healthy eating and we hope in general the entire dish was fulfilling for your. You must try all our Bowls, the "Detox Bowl" is our 2nd most popular bowl after the Buddha Bowl!

Friendly staff, great customer service. Everything we ordered was tasty and clean. It’s hard to find an “organic” restaurant/cafe that doesn’t add a bunch of unhealthy preservatives in their food. I’m sensitive to nutritional yeast and this place doesn’t add it to enhance taste like what majority of restaurants that serve vegan/vegetarian food do; it’s very clean food. I’m hoping that won’t change as they get busier. Nutritional yeast is an additive/preservative that is very sensitive to the gut. There are other sources for b12.<//text>

Good, healthy food and groceries.  But a bit pricey.  Some of the market items can be found at CVS right across the street.   A fun, little shop to browse and find many things unavailable elsewhere in the area.</Text>

Great market/bakery/cafe concept with a clean, organized and pleasant to eat in environment. I met one of the  owners who was super friendly and informative presenting the variety of organic products, focusing on local quality producers, many vegan options, and care for the Planet, offering big variety of products in bulk, and promoting sustainability. I’m sure I will be going back there soon!< /review>

< review>
Equipment is good, and they have a variety of stations to use. The only annoyance is the staff, who obviously don't use any type of lifting equipment in their life, come around interrupting your set of lifting to tell you how to use it properly and to move it. I'm sorry, are you telling me how to lift and what causes a hazard? When you actually have a healthy lifestyle of eating right and weightlifting experience, then you can interrupt my session to tell me I'm doing it wrong. Ive been lifting for 12years, dnt need them telling me how to and how not to lift. There's no reasoning with them. The little hawaiian/hispanic lady, not to be rude, started a fit about the placement of my equipment. It was NOT a hazard, but she was on my case about moving it, and gave the impression she was going to kick me out. I asked the guy staff that was there about the rules of equipment placement, they dnt have any. He showed me other placements, but those were more hazardous then where I had mine. I stated "theres no reasoning with yall, is there, just have to do it where you want huh?" And he said yes...<//review>

I enjoyed this gym a lot. Their facilities are very nice and constantly kept clean and in nice conditions. The staff that works there is very friendly and helpful. They have just about anything you could possibly need for your workout here which is great for being able to get in a variety of workouts during the week. And to top it off there's the food/smoothie bar for an after workout snack/meal.< /review>

<review>Not enough space and the machines crowd the area. The gym is not complete and has been this way for 5+ years. Management needs to continually push to get the gym completed. There is supposed to be a whole section to be added on. This base is the premiere space base in the USAF and the people deserve facilities to reflect this.<//review>< response>

Probably the worst gym I have been to in the Air Force. Granted I've only been to 8 AF gyms, but of the 8 this is the worst. Not enough machines/weights and the ones they do have are extremely close together making everything very crowded. The flow is very disorganized. I know I shouldn't complain, because it is free, but sometime free is not better. I know many people who pay out of pocket to go downtown so they avoid the on base gym.</Text>

Excellent service!! Brought my suit here to be altered for a wedding. He helped get my correct measurements very quickly and efficiently! He has been doing this for many years and it shows! I definitely recommend bringing anything you need fixed or altered here! You won’t be disappointed! 10/10< /Text>

The people here are incredibly nice, fun to talk to, professional, and extremely open to your requests and give you the spotlight rather then dictating throughout the process. They also make me feel comfortable in the space and when walking in the shop, and I feel like I can be myself when I am there.</Text>

I had purchased a bday dress I loved , but when I received it I instantly noticed it was two sizes too big. I thought to my myself no big deal. I’ll just order the right size, but to my surprise the dress was completely sold out. So I went to Google and found Capri Tailor shop and Tom was able to help me with fitting issues. My dress fits like a glove now and I can now walk in confidence and style with my tailored dress in bday! Thank you, Tom!</review><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

I’m very thankful to have found Capri Tailors! They were kind and very hospitable from the minute I walked in. I had never been to a tailor before so with no prior experience of the process I was very pleased by their service. I would definitely come back for more alterations and I will recommend them to my family members and friends.</text>

My wife is a maid of honor and needed a dress altered for the wedding, and since we were visiting our hometown Temecula, we found this spot as it was recommended from someone by the suit store near trader jos and he pointed us to toms shop, glad we found them and my wife had a great experience</Review>

They know what they're doing at Capri Tailoring. Just picked up my dress and it fits perfectly. You cannot find better prices either. I have a dress 2 size small for me. Tony is sweet and accomodating. I walked in with an emergency for an upcoming wedding and Tony was happy to help and eager to please in addition to generously accepting the rush request. He listened to what I had in mind and gently suggested something different without being pushy and it turn out better than what I had in mind. I highly recommend going here and ask for Tony.< /text>

Was very pleased with the owners and their integrity. Honest and reliable service. Love dealing with a family business and with people I feel I can trust.
They are satisfied making an honest living with honest prices and quality work.
Went in for some alterations and bought a suit. I hope never to go to a chain store again</review>

<text>Tom and Shora run the best tailor shop I have ever been to. Over the last 5 years I’ve had jeans, skirts, dresses, formal gowns, my work uniforms, and my three year old’s 3 piece suit tailored. I’ve even had my bikini bottoms scrunched for a better fit. There isn’t anything they cannot do. Also, their turn around time is excellent. Their work is beautiful like no other. I highly recommend them!!!!<//text>< gmap_id>

Tom is wonderful!  I ordered my wedding dress online and it needed a few adjustments. Tom changed it from a zipper to a corset and it’s perfect!  He also made an adjustment on my fiance’s vest. His turnaround time is great - he really works with you. I highly recommend Capri’s!< /Text>

I came to Capri Tailor for my wedding dress alterations. He was so kind and patiently listened to all my insecurities about the dress, took careful notes, and delivered it perfectly. You can’t even tell the dress was ever touched even with the waistline being altered. I can’t say enough good things about this place. Highly recommend!< /text>

I brought my prom dress to Capri Tailoring a few weeks ago to have the straps altered.  I picked up the dress yesterday and when I got home it didn't fit in another area that wasn't altered.. My mom and I brought the dress back today and they were so kind and accommodating.  They fixed the dress within a matter of hours and now it's much more comfortable. This was definitely an emergency since my prom is tomorrow night.  Thank you Capri Tailoring for taking care of this emergency in a hurry and for being so kind. I would definitely recommend your alteration shop to others.</review>

My niece’s prom dress was about 2 sizes too big and was really worried that it wouldn’t fit right after getting it fixed.   She brought it to capris and now it fits perfect! She is so happy with how it turned out. Now she can’t wait prom.<//review>

My sister had her wedding dress altered there and it came out amazing. She looked great and service was friendly and helpful. Price was also reasonable. I would recommend them to all my friends. We were recomend from a friend who had her alterations done there and we are grateful for that recommendation as other taylors prices were much higher. I am having more dressed hemmed because of the amazing prices.</review>

<Text>My wife took her wedding dress here before big day. It needed to be brought it a couple sizes and get a bustle. The gentleman working there literally spent 2 minutes pinning the dress and it came out PERFECT. It was strapless so it was imperative that it fit perfectly. She didnt have to mess with it at all. He also placed the bustle in a way that maintained the beading and design on the back. He assured her that if there are any issues, even the day of, to come back and he would get it done right then. Thankfully he had done a great job the first time around so it was not necessary. Overall, great place and he did an amazing job. If you want it done right the first time, this is your place!<//Text>< time>

This past week, I took my daughter to Capri Tailor for alterations on her prom dress.  The dress was very beautiful, but didn't fit her well.  Capri took measurements and worked some magic.  I couldn't believe how well it fit her.  Great job.  Would highly recommend.<//Review>

<review>I needed hem alterations on my chiffon gown for my Granddaughter's Wedding. My daughter had been to Capri Tailor, a few years prior...so off we went back to Capri Tailor. She was fitted for alterations. I was then fitted, he carefully explained how he would raise the hems at different lengths, after I requested how I'd like it done. When it was ready, I went in, tried it on with my heels and it fit perfectly! This made me very happy! It was strapless and I felt it needed a light shawl. I'd shopped everywhere for it, wrong color, wrong size, etc. then Tom suggested I  buy the yardage, bring it back to him and he'd make it for me! The wedding was a few days off. I did what he said, found the chiffon, exact color of the dress, took it back to him on a Monday late and I'll pick it up Wednesday...the Wedding is Friday. I'm so appreciative he fit this in on his busy schedule. I will be taking all my alterations to him from now on. I recommend him highly!
PS. After hearing our experience, my other Granddaughter took her gown in to Capri Tailor, We are all very satisfied with Tom's work!</review>< Date>

<UserId.>112726314124527627867< /UserId.><Review>Normally I don’t write reviews but I thought wow this place is great! Boy was I wrong! My original review was quite nice but I have to take it back. First, I drop my pants off to get the zipper replaced and the guy was really nice. I go back to pick up my pants and he had put a gold zipper on my pants that had silver buttons on it. I told him that the gold zipper did not match and he proceeded to argue with me and tell me that the original zipper was gold. IT WAS NOT GOLD! So he charges me $18, I paid cash. Then he tells me that he will change the zipper to silver for no extra charge because I asked him. I go into the store yesterday and he brings out my pants. They look ok. Then he proceeds to charge me AGAIN! I tell him I already paid and he argues with me and tells me I did not pay! I told him I paid and he is telling me that I did not pay. By this time I’m very upset and he’s telling me to let him finish talking and proceeds to tell me I did not pay. So he’s raising his voice and arguing with me. Then he shoves my pants at me and tells me to just take them. I would not recommend this place. They are dishonest and they try to steal your money! Like I said I usually don’t write reviews but I had to after how very badly I was treated!<//Review>< time>

We were here for a destination wedding and I needed a shirt. I spoke with Tom and he was extremely helpful. He helped me find a shirt and was able to make alterations to it so it could match the shirt for my tuxedo rental. I would come here again if I lived in the area.<//Review>

<review>After having a few pairs of pants done here I brought in a Levi's jacket to Tom that I had tailored previously and was never satisfied. He helped me brain storm ideas to decide what would be the best way to make my jacket fit me the way I wanted and keep the originality; he never rushed me and gave me his full attention despite his shop filling up with customers. The jacket fit me perfectly upon pick up, now it finally fits the way I've wanted it to since I bought it. This is the only shop in the Valley who I will ever let tailor my clothes. Thank you Tom!!!<//review></record>

Capri Tailor had amazing customer service! This was my first time using this tailor, and the owner was extremely polite! He called the day before to make sure I was still coming to pick up my lace wedding dress which turned out amazing! He made sure I was completely satisfied with his work, and even told me if I find something to just bring it back in the next day and he would fix it on the spot! Amazing experience and awesome owner! Super polite with my nephew too!<//Text>

I am impressed with the fine work they do here. Not only that, their honesty is a big plus. My brought in some slacks for alteration and had not noticed some damage to the pants. I was informed that it would probably be most costly to alter the pants and repair them then to actually get a new pair. I appreciate the honestly and fine work!<//Text>

<review>I needed alterations for my dress for my daughters wedding.  My dress was too big on the sides and on the bust.  It also needed the hem shortened but the bottom of the dress was done in cloth roses.  I needed an expert to cut the bottom portion of the dress and lift it up so I would not lose any of the cloth roses.  Tom assured me that he could take care of it all and not ruin the dress.  When I picked up the dress and tried it on it was absolutely exquisitely done.  Not only is Capri tailoring a master of tailoring, the entire staff is friendly, humble and so kind.  I have recommended them for 2 of the bride maids and also to the mother of the bride and they too were so happy with their work. Thank you Capri Tailoring for making this very special day stress free for our family!</review>< pictures>

<review>I got my wedding dress altered and was extremely pleased with the result.  He is very customer service oriented.  He was willing to have my dress ready whenever I wanted.  He was willing to work with my timeline.  When I came to try it on and the bustle wasn't quite right when I put it on, he fixed it right there in 15 minutes, with no extra charge.  I would recommend him to anyone - he really wanted to make sure that I was happy with the results and he succeeded!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

My prom dress was around 2 sizes too big for me, it needed to be tightened and the bottom of the dress needed to be shortened and Capri Tailor did an amazing job! The dress was perfectly tailored and done in a very short amount of time. Highly recommend, you must go!!< /review>

My dad has been coming to him for YEARS and has mentioned copious amount of times how great and thankful he is for Capri Tailor...there is no better and we have had no better experience with any other tailor than him- I strongly recommend.
I needed my prom dress tailored drastically in a matter of two days and it was done perfectly and I am beyond pleased with the turnout.< /review>

I bought a beautiful dress from another military spouse for the marine corps ball but I didn't like the mesh top that was attached to it.  Capri tailoring cut the mesh off and put in a corset type back to support the dress. It looked exactly how I wanted it! Thank you so much for the great service!< /review>

Awesome experience, these guys know what they are doing and they have very fair pricing. I recommend coming here if you need a suit tailored. The best part is they offer same day tailoring! I'll be back :)< /review>

This family owned business is the best I have ever experienced.  The men's suits they have for sale there are the best, and they tailor them to fit you perfectly.  Customer service is out of this world.  They have mens and women's clothes for sale along with accessories.  I will never go anywhere else!</review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>We were a bit worried about taking my fiancés' wedding dress to anyone to have it altered. Capri was not only able to do all the work we originally wanted done, they also helped with some major reconstruction on the top of the dress. Needless to say the work was top notch and matched the dress perfectly. They were very accommodating and easy to work with.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I actually went to Facebook to find recommendations for a tailor, to alter my dress for the Marine Corps Birthday Ball in a couple of weeks. I was really stressed out and rushed because of issues with a prior dress, and Tom and his wife saved me! I don't know how they did it but just by hemming it and taking up the neck strap, they turned it into an entirely new dress. In a week! And so inexpensively. I'm so impressed and will definitely be back for any other alterations I need!</text>

A friend of mine recommended Capri Tailoring to me saying they do their job quick and very well at a good price, so I went to go check it out and they sure did a great job at a short amount of time. I came in the day I got my dress 15 minutes before they were going to close and although they did everything quickly, it was not rushed. A week later they already had it fitted perfectly, right in time for prom! They also gave me options and advice on how I wanted my dress to look like, like different styles I wanted on my dress. If you are looking for great service and someone who can get your stuff fixed nice and fast at a good price, this is the place to go! :)</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Bring your dresses here!!!

I came here to get my bridesmaid dress fitted. My dress was huge and I needed a lot done to it, multiple inches taken in and about 5 inches in length taken off the bottom.
Not only did they make it fit perfectly, but they added a little something extra for me as a surprise which was truly a blessing. They steamed it for me as I paid and now I am ready to go for the wedding this weekend.

Couldn't be happier with the work they did, I will be coming here for all my alterations from now on. Great work, friendly staff, you really can't get better than that.</review>

<Review>Capri Talioring has been so wonderful! I would definitely recommend them to anyone!  I ordered a formal gown online, and it arrived with the wrong measurements.  Tom at Capri Tailoring did an amazing job taking it in in all the right places and fixing all of the things that had gone wrong with it.  He was very attentive and helpful also- I knew I could trust him to meet my tight timeline to have the dress done.
I also took in a pair of jeans that had a large hole in the rear.  He was able to fix them so you could barely tell they had ripped.
His prices were very reasonable and the service was great.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>Terrible work. The tailor took two seconds to measure the hem for two pairs of pants. I was concerned but based on the majority of reviews felt I was in good hands. I mentioned I wanted a slight break just to be sure. I get home and it was if he measured someone that's a foot taller! I had a jacket altered and two pairs of pants hemmed for $104. Complete rip off for sub par work.< /text><Name>Josh Bennetts</Name><userid>105910119357992580209<//userid>< pics>

I recently moved to Temecula and I have been looking for a good tailor and reasonable prices, I tried Capri Tailor and was amazed by the quality of the work as well as the time that took him to finish my dress since I had a wedding overseas, and was used to my previous tailor but now I finally found a good one and also knows the job well.
I really appreciated the work that was done on my dress especially that it was a really expensive dress i was worried about the end result but definitely i would go back for anything need to be done on my clothes</text>

Capri tailor saved my entire wedding! I tried my wedding dress on 4 days before my wedding and couldn't get it zipped up in the back. I brought it to capri's hoping theyou would be able to get it done in time and they did! It was done in 2 days! I don't know what I would have done without them. I will continue to bring all my items here in time the future. Thank you Capri</Review>

<Text>Had the BEST experience ever with Capri Tailor, I had to get my wedding dress done super super fast and they were able to get me on a monday and had my dress done by wednesday..and I'm getting married friday,(very good price as well) its an awesome family business and the customer service was great. I would recommend anyone to come here. Shora was super sweet and altered my dress and the hem looked exactly the same before as after, and the bustle layer perfect.. THANK YOU SO MUCH CAPRI TAILOR..

<review>Pros:

Simple to follow instructions
Shipments were on-time

Cons:

Way to overpriced
Customer Service operations is terrible
UX of the app is horrible
Food is okay at best
Meat quality is suspect
Your recycle bin will be full after 1 shipment - (Seriously way too much packaging)

Maybe if I was a busy single person, but as a family of 3, it's not worth it!<//review>< pictures>

It's just UNACCEPTABLE. you have a scene of 6 - 8 cautious snails on dock who clearly seem to be somewhat confuced when you say "i have a delivery for you" nothing is getting done.

<review>BA is late, as others have noted, a goodly portion of the time.  I've had every other delivery late, or not late for a month.  I don't use them exclusively, but every time something irritates me - I go to cancel and I get a credit for the late deliveries (after much complaining) and stay with them to use it up.  Food is not THAT good that they can't schedule deliveries on time. Especially when during winter time - I HAVE to have my road plowed in time for FedEx, then it's late and I may need to plow again.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

My issue with the company is that they've had several occasions where they unilaterally changed the meals that they sent without any notice AFTER they billed my account for it.  They also unilaterally changed the length of time you had to edit your order before it became finalized, also without providing any notice.  So buyer beware - you have no idea what you're paying for when it comes to Blue Apron.</review></record></dataset><record>

Very nice people but very slow to load. No way you can ever may your delivery appointment on time if you load appointment is at 5am and nobody  starts loading til 8 and you aren't finished being loaded til 11. 1300 miles in a 65mph truck with all that wasted time = late. Still they are nice and plenty of room for backing. Make sure your doors hug the trailer as tight as possible because you'll only have milimeters between your trailer and the one next to you.<//Text>

<Review>I went into skip the meals for the week of Thanksgiving...TWICE and was not able to because of the holiday and rescheduling.  The Tuesday before Thanksgiving I find that is is due to be delivered on Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  I called but unfortunately there was no way to stop it.  They did credit my account, however, were not able to credit my credit card and being so close to Christmas I really cannot afford it.  Not to mention the meals are definitely NOT what I would have pick and I will be going out of town so I won't even be home to get the food.  I guess it will have to sit on my porch for days....SO ANGRY!  I will be disputing this with my credit card company and cancelling my subscription to Blue Apron!< /Review>< Resp>

I have been using Blue Apron for about 14 months now.  I LOVE it!  I come home from work too tired and stressed to cook a "from scratch" dinner, let alone try to get creative.  We were in a rut of eating too many fast foods and the same "go to" recipes all the time.  With Blue Apron, I know that in 30 minutes I will be serving a gourmet quality meal.  It has pushed me outside my comfort zone in terms of ingredients and methods.  I call it my "leap of faith" because I often thing "eew" when I see the food listed but I can guarantee that every time it's going to be amazing!  I also appreciate the freshness of the ingredients and the fact that a high percentage of the ingredients are organic, grass fed and locally produced.   And though I've been cooking for decades, I've learning all kinds of new techniques - like how to cook an entire meal with one pot and one frying pan by wiping it out in between ingredients.  And I've used more shallots and lemons in the last year than I did in 30 years before that!!!  The customer service is great.  The few times I've had an issue with missing ingredients, I've had a response within hours and the problems have always been resolved to my satisfaction.<//Text>

I gave Blue Apron as a baby gift.  New parents are so overwhelmed, It was the BEST baby gift they received.  I then gave it to a friend who's having some medical procedures.  Having delicious easy-to-prepare meals on their doorsteps was a godsend.
I must add that that Blue Apron's customer service rivals their recipes in being outstanding.  I recommend them without hesitation<//review>

Blue Apron has changed our lives. The recipes are as fun as building with LEGOs, and the food is as good as our favorite restaurants. Fresher and less expensive than Whole Foods. It’s enabled me to cook a delicious meal at home with no advance planning. Thank you for making cooking fun again!<//text>

<review>Great service! Always fresh ingredients and you get to try new fresh products you never knew  what to do with them Before. I love the fact you get the amount of produce you need for each recipe, so no waste anymore! And the fee is so reasonable. My husband and I enjoyed all the foods so far and I highly recommend Blue apron to anyone who loves cooking and trying new flavor and who has busy life schedule and don't have time for shopping and who is tired of having junk foods outside everyday ;) Thank you Blue Apron for such a great service. You made my life easier and more fun❤️❤️<//review>< date>

So far so good after 4 weekly deliveries. Packages have all arrived on time, no damage and the ice packs are still frozen.  We are on the two person meal plan even though we are a family of 4. Our 2 teenagers are sporadically home for dinner, but seem to want to stick around more often now to "see what's cookin'".  It has actually created more family time at the dinner table and less fast food trips (which often cost more and less healthy)
Pros - 80% of the recipes have been excellent. 20% just OK.
The meats and vegetables have all been fresh and of very good quality.  Directions are easy to follow.  Price point is good, not great.
You can stretch the 2 person meal into a 4 person meal by adding more meat or rice/pasta.
Packaging is reusable and great for camping, hunting, fishing.
Cons - Packaging is not great if you have no use for it.<//Text>

I can't say enough about Blue Apron - exotic yet convenient, healthy, affordable meals delivered to my door every week.  You have enhanced my life!</text>

Blue Apron has been a wonderful alternative to
cooking monotony. Now I just open the box and there are 3 new
recipes for me to try.  The recipes are delicious, healthy and easy to prepare (although there is a lot of chopping, so I bought myself a good knife).
My husband is happy we are eating out less and that we can enjoy restaurant quality meals at home. Because the recipes are new,
I find that the Blue Apron meals taste like someone else cooked them for me!</review>

I love Blue Apron for many reasons.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious and the recipes got me cooking dishes—especially ethnic cuisine—that I would have never thought of preparing, or using ingredients I never knew existed. Also, I love to cook but don't like to shop for groceries, so Blue Apron is great for me. All of the ingredients are provided along with very simple, clear, and colorful directions that the least experienced cook could follow. My son is a customer and gifted me with a one week package of three meals, and I have been hooked ever since.  The groceries are packaged on ice so everything arrives very cold. This would be a perfect wedding gift for a young couple, whether they are experienced or novice chefs. It is also good  for a working person; it is much cheaper than eating out. An elderly couple for whom grocery shopping is a chore would also appreciate it. You can customize meal preferences, such as vegan, no red meat etc.  My advice: Go for it!<//text>

Nothing but good things to say about Blue Apron.  Their recipes are easy to follow and I can say i have become a much better cook using the techniques and recipes I have received.  Their customer service is top notch as well.  When a package arrived a day late, they were right on it.  Requested I do not use the food (because they only want us to use FRESH ingredients) and refunding my purchase for the week.  Was it a bit disappointing not to be able to cook those recipes, sure, but the way they handled the situation was great.  I never judge by mistakes - they happen!  My 5 stars are based on the quality of the ingredients, ease of use and the outstanding customer service.  Very professional and "together" company.  I tried another service, no comparison.  Blue Apron are tops in this field.<//Text>

It should not be this hard to cancel your service.  Calling Blue Apron is useless as the queue times are always too long.  Their automated phone services tells you to leave a message that will be returned, but then it promptly hangs up on you. Completely dishonest!</text>

The order just showed up to my door: the ice packs inside were completely melted and everything including the raw shrimp and fish were warm. I'll change this rating to one star if I get sick from this. I've dealt with 3 other meal delivery systems and this has never happened before. Food safety is important so I'm surprised to say the least.<//text>

<Text>after seeing the commercials on TV and FB and feeling like I was making the same thing every week, I wanted to try something different.  Got our first shipment and my husband was looking at the recipe cards and said "I'm not going to like this"
I made the first meal (cod with barley) and he was blown away.  First I don't like cooked fish and I loved it.  My husband loved it and loved that I was eating cooked fish.
Our second meal was an African chicken and rice with kale.  My husband thought it was going to be too spicy, so I didn't add all of the spice.  Again, he was very impressed.
Our third meal was beef tacos, and again it was wonderful.

I love cooking and found all the recipes to be easy to follow (you need to read the entire recipe before you start to get the timings correct).< /Text>< pics>

<text>3 Times they shipped weekly orders that I had already officially skipped.  The final time I had very clear records (including a screen snapshot) that confirmed I had cancelled the order a week in advance, and they still insisted on delivery and charging me.

Aside from that obvious fraudulent behavior, their selection is only about half the size of that offered by the other larger delivery services, and is not "better" in any objective way.  I'm a member of several services and would say that BlueApron would be equivalent to HelloFresh, except that BlueApron has a noticeably less well designed website (comparatively difficult to use), less customer service (restricted hours and other obstacles), and a smaller menu - but about the same in all other areas.

I cancelled and will not miss their poor service.<//text><userid>115792698108369864389< /userid>< pictures>

Blue apron is a waste of money. I was a customer for a while, but my packages were constantly arriving damaged. On more than one occasion the raw chicken had exploded, ruining everything else in the box. The wine was also constantly damaged. Customer service (or lack there of) was completely unhelpful. When my final package arrived damaged - it was the last straw and I cancelled my service. I was promised that I would receive a refund for the damaged box. That was in April. It is now almost June and they still have yet to refund my money. Blue Apron could be right for you, if you like throwing $ straight into the garbage. I would not recommend this service to anyone I care for.</Text>

It is a home cook's dream; fresh ingredients that you prep from raw components and transform into a nice meal. There customer service is out of this world. I had a package missing from my front door step and I thought for sure I would be out of the money and food. I sent customer service an email (Tiffany D.) expecting to get the typical, "sorry for you experience, better luck next time", and I got a prompt response. She immediately refunded my money, without me asking, researched the issue, and made suggestions to prevent this unfortunate incident from happening again. She also, wisely, reminded me not to eat the food if it ended up on my doorstep later in the week due to its perishable condition. I'm sold on the company, very great job Blue Apron.

We really like Blue Apron and have been using this service for about a month. The package has come at the same time every Tuesday. The food is fresh and always looks good. We love the directions and look forward to making each meal. We have enjoyed everything we have chosen, and we have learned much about cooking using the Blue Apron instructions.

The portions seem just right, and we feel like we are eating food that is good for us.  We highly recommend Blue Apron!<//Text>

<Text>My wife and I have been using Blue Apron for three months, every other week. We are vegetarians and are very appreciative of the great variety of meals we have received. It is especially satisfying to make our own 'quick' meals from the carefully assembled ingredients. It is nice to try something new without buying a whole lot of it, just the amount for that meal. The instructions and pictures are very well done, it is clear that a lot of testing and preparation goes into each dish. Most of our meals I would rate as 4-5 stars. Of course there have a been a few that we did not care for much, but the adventure is part of the enjoyment. Sometimes the preparation time is longer than they suggest, but nothing onerous.  When you consider the lack of food waste and that we frequently get one or two lunches out of the deal, we consider Blue Apron to be priced very fairly.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

We started out liking Blue Apron, but now think they are having some QC issues.  Of late, we have received packages of meat that are not sealed, vegetables that are partially dry or even spoiled and an occasional missing ingredient.  Recipes also seem to get "stuck" on certain ingredients - in April, we have had several meals using fennel, which is a strong aromatic spice that we are not fond of.  On the other hand, their fish is wonderful!  The company has always responded promptly to our emails, but when you have to toss the open, leaking package of meat at 4 PM, your dinner plans are suddenly a scramble.< /Text>

I always have a hard time thinking of what to make for dinner besides the same basic things.  My husband is vegetarian, and we have been blown away by all the tasty and amazing dishes I have cooked.  Pretty pleased that my daughter kept suggesting I do this and got me a week for my birthday!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Blue Apron is totally fantastic!  My wife and I now cook together 6 days a week (yep, we have a subscription to both the meat and vegetarian meals, so we receive 2 shipments of 3 meals each/week!).  We find the food delicious, appropriately sized, easy to prepare, inexpensive and the instructions are clear and accurate. We also subscribe to their wine service, so we get exceptionally well-paired wines to savor with our meals.   I actually can't rave enough about the wines, so I highly recommend you try out their service.  The best part of all, though, is we don't have to shop at the grocery store and buy more ingredients than needed.  Blue Apron is an incredible time-saver and avoids an enormous amount of wasted food.<//text>

I highly recommend Blue Apron.  The meals are DELICIOUS!  Keep in mind that you do all of the food preparation from scratch.

I would call this a food shopping service.  The good thing is all the meals are 500 to 700 calories and they're wonderfully seasoned.

You choose if you like meat, poultry, fish and other preferences and Blue Apron plans your menus and mails you a box of food, spices and directions.  I did have to have my own salt, pepper and olive oil for my meals.

I did the 2-Person Plan, which offers two meals for three days at six meals total.  It cost $59.94 and shipping is always free.

You can also choose the Family Plan, which serves four.  Eight meals total cost $69.92 per delivery.

Blue Apron also offers wine pairing with your meals.  I didn't try that, so I can't tell you how that goes.

I have to say the ingredients are always very fresh.  The meals are packaged in a container that keeps the heat out and your food is sandwiched between two slabs of ice.

I had to cancel my meals because I was going to be unable to find time to cook, but I still got one delivery because I was a little too late.  You can reactivate with ease.

I did find that chopping, shredding and other preparation took longer than the directions indicated.

Still, if you have the time to make your own meals from start to finish, Blue Apron is definitely worth it!<//Review>

<text>Life changing...and in a GREAT way!  This service and company are catching on like WILD FIRE!  WAY fewer trips to the grocery store means WAY less $$ being spent on food.  MUCH less wasted food in my fridge too!  The only downside would be less compost (since I'm not buying 2x as much of all the ingredients a recipe calls for!) which means we're making less good soil!!! So wonderful!  Thank you, Blue Apron!</text>< pictures>

Having 3 excellent meals already prepped has lowered our waste and cost for groceries.  No extra fennel bulbs to throw out or spices we purchase for just one meal. The delivery is on time, the menu with directions and all the required ingredients means that we do not have to worry about 3 meals during the week. Quality of ingredients excellent!

I just wish I had tried Blue Apron earlier.<//Text><gmapID>0x808578661b153d75:0x6883475c0630912a<//gmapID>< Resp>

<text>Great service and really creative recipes.  I am a chef for a living and I love to cook but the last thing I want to do when I get home is figure out whats for dinner and go grocery shopping.  It's also really hard to cook for 2 people.  When you want to make a recipe you have to buy a whole jar of capers, a pound of butter etc and you have a lot of left over ingredients.  We always end up throwing it away before we use it.  But with Blue Apron you get everything you need portioned out for 2 people.  The directions are so easy and clear that sometimes my husband cooks dinner for me now!</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<review>Was offered 2 free meals in the mail and by email.
Tried to get the free meals but was told I need to order 6 meals in order to get the 2 free ones.
This is not quite kosher to me especially the "other conditions" are buried in the fine prints..
IMO, this contradicts to what FTC refers to "free" -
Free Products
A product that's advertised as free if another is purchased - "buy one, get one" - indicates that the consumer will pay nothing for the one item and no more than the regular price for the other. Ads like these should describe all the terms and conditions of the free offer clearly and prominently.

<time>1460498373117</time><Review>My sister turned me onto Blue Apron and we really like the quality and service. We also signed up for the monthly wine delivery, it is fun to follow the tasting recommendations on the cards that come with the food and wine. Best part is -no waste. When I shop I end up buying too much because I'm not good at gauging portion size, especially when it comes to vegetables. So far, the meals are generous size (two adults) and I like that there is no leftovers to bother with. It is also very convenient that the weekly menu is already thought out -less for me to think about/buy. Very happy!< /Review><UserId.>114790045390420592614< /UserId.><Pics>None</Pics><user_name>Grace Cheney< /user_name></record>

<Text>I wouldn't be surprised if BA paid interns to write these positive reviews.  I don't think the meals are very good.  I don't understand why they can't precut the ingredients. The meals are time consuming to make. You may as well make it yourself and you would make bigger portions etc.  Recipes are too complicated.

The other HUGE problem that they have is the website. It is difficult to cancel your order. It was not obvious on the website. I finally found someone in "customer service" to email since you can never get a live person. They directed me to a cancel service link. I filled out the information and it would not go through literally!!!!

Is this a ploy to prevent us from cancelling orders. The link did not work. Or is it a huge problem with their IT? Either way the company is ridiculous. Stay AWAY!<//Text><pics>None</pics><name>Emily Wu<//name>< GmapID>

<review>Sometimes everything is right and sometimes everything is wrong.  If you have the patience to fix the f-ups with rotten produce and expired meat, then you can have a lot of fun cooking things you normally wouldn't cook.  The variety can be interesting, though there is a definite tendency to OVERDO lemon.  It's worth a shot for a while, but you may find yourself done with it after a couple months.< /review>< Rate>

<Text>I thought I would last a few months on blue apron - thinking I would tire of it.  I did not - it has been over a year I think.  Here is why I love it:  1.  I do not have to think at all about what to have for dinner 2 nights (plus) a week.  2.  It is SO SO FRESH, with great fresh spices.  It is the freshest food I've had and I tend to buy fresh food anyway.  3.  The tastes are varied and delicious.  4.  it is for the most part quite easy to pull together.  5.  For us, and where we live, it is actually quite inexpensive.

A few weeks ago, my "knick knacks" (spices/condiments) got mixed up and I was left with chicken breasts, broccoli, and rice.  So I just sautéed the chicken in another sauce I had, steamed the broccoli and boiled the rice.  It was delicious - the food was so fresh and tasty.  My family loved it.  Goes to show that the quality is fantastic.

I doubt I will ever not have blue apron.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808578661b153d75:0x6883475c0630912a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<review>What I liked:

-Many of the recipes were yummy
-The directions were very clear and easy to follow
-Customer Service was okay
-Canceling was easy

What I didn't like:
-Some of the recipes were quite bland (and after so much effort on my part!)

-Sometimes the food was turned -- meat and vegetables --even though the box was delivered on time.  Really?

-And then there's the not being delivered on time.  3 times in a row our food box was delayed.  Every morning there'd be a new notice from UPS.  One time, it had left the warehouse and was en route for 4 days before it got to us.  Seriously?  They had no idea where it was.  All the ice packs were soft and the meal boxes themselves were soft.  Needless to say the fish and meat were no longer usable.  This is a BIG problem for so many reasons.  It's REALLY inconvenient to plan out your meals and not get groceries for every dinner, and then either have no box or have the meat in the box be spoiled.

-Many people said customer service was not good.  I thought they were fine, but all they could do was credit me for the following week's box when what I wanted was to just close out the account and get reimbursed!  Finally, I closed out the account without even getting reimbursed.< /review><user_id>115191061177711110808< /user_id><Gmap_id>0x808578661b153d75:0x6883475c0630912a< /Gmap_id><time>1453162628547<//time><user_name>Michelle Blair</user_name>< Response>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Thievery.  Will not let you delete credit card from service.  Automatically charges you for a meal without telling you (for a meal that you don't choose) for 7 days in the future, and you can't get re-imbursed "because it's too late".  Meals are expensive, packaging is extremely wasteful, my first one came with a ripped pesto package that got over everything.  Can't get meals for one person.  Delivery times are all over the place, not practical.< /review><name>JP Smith< /name><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

REALLY good food - HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE customer service. Incompetent delivery service - have received about 10 deliveries, more than half of which have been wrong, completely defeating the purpose and obliterating any convenience. Ingredients missing from deliveries, no show deliveries, etc. Will look for an alternative service once I catch up with all of the credits I have from mistakes. Wish they were as competent as they are nice. They just don't cut it.< /text>

<Review>This is great in theory, and I enjoy cooking the meals with my family.  Most of them taste pretty good. But there is one signifiant problem preventing me from giving this a five-star rating:  They do not include enough vegetables in many of the meals.  Tonight's "dinner" was a pork and noodle dish, which was very tasty.  But the "meal" (which is supposed to feed two people) included exactly one ounce of pea shoots for the vegetable.  Not one pound; one OUNCE!  The portions of meat are generally adequate, but portions of cheese and vegetables are often inadequate.  I have provided plenty of feedback to them about this, and others have as well; they do not seem to be listening to their customers.<//Review>< Rate>

The food is good but I could not get past the excessive packaging. Plus, Blue Apron doesn't even have a recycling or reuse program for the huge icepacks, massive plastic containers and styrofoam used in all of its deliveries. I couldn't get past it, seemed so far behind the times in terms of environmental awareness -- particularly for the food-conscious, health conscious consumer they are trying to court.</review>

I cancelled my subscription after the introductory offer. I knew this wasn't going to be any easier for me than picking up my own ingredients at the local market. But they continued billing me, and sending more boxes. I went online and tried to stop it again, and they just keep taking the money and sending more food! There is no way to go back and stop it, because if you "log in" again they consider it re-starting your subscription.
I called their offices and they have refunded me for two of the boxes after saying they would refund for all of it. I may have to let the bank handle it.</text>

Terrible chicken, like rubber slime.  Missing ingredients, WAY too much packaging. Too many dirty dishes and pans. Maybe good for youngsters that dont no how to shop, but there's no place for this in a grownup's
Kitchen!</text>< pics>

The meals, when they arrive on time, are very well organized and planned, fresh and unique.  Not your typical dinner fare. Unfortunately, they have issues with their delivery service.

After just a few successful deliveries and meals, they did not deliver on the scheduled day last week.  This was disruptive, because we had not gone to the store in anticipation of receiving our box. Arriving home late from work, we were disappointed that no box had arrived as scheduled and were left to that run to the store which we were so trying to avoid.  Customer service closes at 3PM PST, so we had no idea if we were going to receive the box late or at all, so we stocked up on meals that were supposed to be supplied by Blue Apron.  The next morning, the box arrived.  Now we had double the amount of food we needed!

Yesterday, our expected delivery DID NOT arrive again.  Calling customer service, the associate explained that the delivery "was found to be spoiled" and rather than delivering a spoiled box, they cancelled it altogether.  They knew they could not deliver, yet they failed to communicate. When we they going to tell us?

I hope this is just growing pain.  We WANT to love Blue Apron's service, but if this inconsistency continues, we'll have no choice but to discontinue.<//Text><UserId.>102585733907398713041<//UserId.>< date>

I would of given this 5 stars if the packaging was recyclable I would of given 4 stars if I didn't now find out I just gave my "free" meal award to my BFF, before I read the comments that it's not a "free" meal.  That is very sneaky Blue Apron, what else are you trying to pullover on us.  Food is ok and love the concept.....but don't like being misled,</text>

Great to try new recipes, pretty healthy meals, the veggies and greens always super fresh.  BUT dealing with a weekly box, with large liner, and 4 ice packs is too much hassle.  They need to pick up ice packs with the next delivery and re-use them!  Terrible waste, and ridiculous hassle.< /review>

<Text>For starters the workers do not wash their hands and follow thourough procedure befor packaging. If i could give them 0 stars i would. This company is super unproffesional, my fiance was a security guard there. They discriminated him and recently fired him for something he did not do. They do not pay the employees all their hours they work for. They are extremely rude and unproffessional. This is by far the worst company standing. They discriminate and they dont even acknowledge the work their employees put in. They are horrible.</Text>< pics>

Love the flavors that I've been exploring with like the Ras Hanout, curries, sweet potato salad, and the arugula/watermelon salad that I've never fathomed to create.  The recipes come in 6 steps or less, I've never cooked to the precise consistency until now and it's become my new favorite activity at the end of the day. As a teacher I am exhausted, defeated and dread going to the grocery store as well as deciding what to eat, so life is simple and effortless now; the meals are scrumpalicious!</Review>

Just another huckster.

Average food with no useful control on menu.

Received as a gift and they required a credit card from us to sign us up for their subscription service, then rebilled and send another unwanted delivery because we didn't cancel 7 days in advance.<//Text>

It was my first time trying this location, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed! The location is more humble, but the quality is superior to any other sushi we have had in California (Sugarfish just doesn't disappoint you!)

The "Don't Think, Just Eat" is the best way to go, but IF you can stomach it (and I believe in you!) GET THE SEASONAL AND DAILY SPECIALS toooo! :) and definitely pairing with a hot green tea, they had YAMA MOTO YAMA green tea (one of my faves) when I went in today.

This is a sushi restaurant that pays attention to the quality of the cuts and ingredients and with intent. I didn't find myself dipping in extra sauces, rather just enjoying the sushi for what it is, which is their goal. Sugarfish has a propensity to go above and beyond, serving you emotions on a plate, and man, oh, man, I couldn't control my smile and dancing lol!

And oh my goodness, their daily special of the big scallop sushi today was devine!!! However, I was happily surprised by the garnish under the salmon skin sushi! The eel, truth be told, wasn't my fave, but I just don't like eel so you might love it! My boyfriend inhaled it lmao.

Carlos was our wonderful server, as is all the staff, he was exceptionally sweet, attentive, funny, and had wonderful timing.

Literally my only complaint is that while the 16% tip is already included, you can't add more, and BOY do I wish we could tip MORE without breaking their "no tipping rule." They're just so wonderful! Let me throw money at your servers Sugarfish lol.<//Text>< Pictures>

Absolutely the best customer service and fresh fish I've had from all their locations.

DISCLAIMER I was a new walk up customer, not a food app pick up or pre-order and didn't know that other locations don't take walk up orders.

The manager took my order with a smile  (I can see it thru the mask) and was incredibly friendly. I mean beyond friendly. I even asked where I could use a restroom near by assuming they don't allow customers to use the restroom and he immediately said "come on in". He made me feel like a regular as if my order was the most important order of the day.

LA...this experience doesn't happen to often and I'm sure you'll a agree especially because I'm a new customer to the location passing through from a work meeting in the valley heading back to DTLA.

100 stars for the management team! I'd drive back just for you guys! Which I probably will do this weekend.

I went back to sugar fish in DTLA in the evening with my daughter for dinner because I was so happy with my experience ...you'll have to read what happened on their yelp.

Cheers to Sugarfish Studio City. Keep the food vibes com'n!!!<//Text>

Great to be able to get it to go. The sushi was tasty and the instructions in the box were helpful. I wish the price were a bit lower for takeout since you have to eat it all at once and it's not as fresh as when you dine in and have it served course by course. But it still hits the spot as a special to go treat meal< /Text>

Without a doubt, top quality fish and incredible packaging of to-go orders. Sugarfish is not our "go to" sushi restaurant, however, it is one of our favorite special occasion dining treats. The quality of everything (fish, rice, sauces, presentation, etc.) is far superior to everything else out there. You definitely get what you pay for and we love to celebrate with a meal from Sugarfish!<//text>

Terrible experience tonight. 90+ minutes from order to pickup, not including the 20 minutes it took waiting outside their parking lot because no one picked up the phone (4 tries) and one car was blocking 5+ others in part because no one from the restaurant ever peeked their head out the door to be helpful. Disappointed.< /text>

<rating>3<//rating><text>I usually LOVE Sugarfish, but I feel like I got a Frankenstein box this time around. The salmon sashimi had a bone in it and the pieces weren’t cut through all the way so they were in a weird half separated strip. The tuna sashimi was also two very distinct colors (one the normal red and the other light creamy pink in color).< /text>< Pictures>

Oh Sugarfish, how I love you! The TRUST ME option never fails. Great service, even if they don't take reservations and you have to wait to get seated. But if you show up before 6pm the wait is super short!< /review>

< Review>
First time at SUGARFISH... It exceeded expectations. It's been on my list for quite a while, but haven't gone because I just never wanted to sit and wait forever on a busy Friday/Saturday night.

Took my chances and it was my lucky day! Came and got sat immediately! Thank God, because the hangry girl was about to come out.

The menu is very simple; no crazy dynamite roll choices...
We ordered the:
"Don't Think. Just Eat"
- Handrolls
- Sashimi
- Nigiri

Warm rice, melts in your mouth, I am drooling writing this. I will never look at sushi the same.

Can we get one in Orange County pleassseeee??!!!< /Review>

Good sushi but the wait is horrible and ordering from the App, there are no time to choose for when to  pickup but just ASAP which is very deceiving since you don't know when the actual order is ready.</review>

Disappointed that in LA they don't have any vegetarian options. I think they need to find a better balance of experience vs customer service. It felt very controlling that they would not allow you to deviate, ask for a side, or anything extra. I understand the quality is important, but if I wanted to feel controlled at the dinner table, I'd be a child eating in a high chair.< /review>

The food is excellent here. The fish is so fresh and delicious. However, they don't take reservations, everybody in your party has to be there before they will seat you. And the portions are really small. I ordered the nozawa light and had to add salmon sashimi and a hand roll of bay scallops to that as well. The bay scallops were amazing though, so sweet and fresh.< /text>

Mediocre, over hyped and over priced. The rice was over seasoned (to the point where it was so heavily vinegared that you couldn't taste the fish). Did the 'don't think just eat' price fix, the first course of sashimi was delicious and perfect and then each subsequent dish was worse that the previous one, ending with eel that was mushy in texture and literally left a bad taste in my mouth. For the price, in LA, you can do just do better. I see no need to go back.< /text>

This place is good and simple. Every time I've been here they mess up the order of food being brought... I usually end up with extra food or a second round of something because of it. Never had a bad experience though</Text>

Had my first lobster roll, & it was delicious. At $14, it's the most expensive roll, but it was delicious, & filling. Tiny location (apparently the original one?), but really clean, intimate & quiet. Great staff. Quality fish, fantastic sushi. Definitely recommend! 🍣</text>

< Review>
Sugar fish used to be amazing. After Nozawa retired from his restaurant and his sons' chain (Sugar Fish) took over, they kept the amazing quality of fish that people had come to expect from Sushi Nozawa; however, as Sugar Fish has continued to grow, their quality has diminished. They are still a delicious option for sushi in LA, but Kiwami (down the street) has better quality fish. The one thing that Sugar fish does have going for it is their amazing to-go boxes which are beautifully packaged and taste great even after a car ride.<//Review>

Authentic Sushi in a non-authentic setting. The sushi is top quality but the ambiance is lacking, very small location. As long as you are in and dining before they close you can stay and finish your meal. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a new sushi experience that doesn't include "american-style". The rolls are not topped with spicy mayo or any other garbage, just straight sushi. What I would expect when dining in Japan (minus the sushi train and chefs making the rolls in front of you)< /Review>

My favorite thing on the menu is the blue crab hand roll. It’s a bit pricey but it’s an awesome date spot (good ambiance and small). It can take a while to get a table so plan ahead.

I really love the food at SUGARFISH. They have great rolls and sushi. The atmosphere is very dark, so it's a good place for any small dinner meetings or dates. It gets very packed, so I would suggest adding some extra padding with time. The food is a little on the expensive side for what it is, but it's still pretty good quality. The only issue here is that the staff don't always have the best attitudes, but usually everything else is pretty good on their end.< /Text>

Great sushi place. Small but cozy. Not taking reservations and not informing about the wait time is kind of waste of time.
Would also appreciate if everyone's dish, especially when ordering the same set, was served at the same time.

<Review>Absolutely amazing. Completely worth all the hype & anything you've read, seen, or heard. Came here on a Wednesday night around 7pm. Yes, there is a wait, but good things come to those who do (yoda).
My girlfriend brought me here for my birthday and we did their version of Omakase "Dont think. Just Eat". We were served a total of 16 unbelievable courses. Between sushi, hand rolls, and other amazing treats I could not have felt more spoiled by coming here.
SPECIAL SHOUTOUT to our AMAZING Server 'Cameron'. This dude was so professional & well spoken he made the whole experience even more special.
Thank you very much to Cameron & Sugarfish for living up to the reputation & helping my girlfriend plan an amazing birthday.<//Review>< Response>

The food was amazing, best sushi I've ever had!! There were a few mistakes from the staff, some handled it gracefully but one was condescending. It's understandable, it's very busy and a lot of customers coming through. The sushi and the atmosphere makes it worth it! Make sure you're clear on what's on the menu, what you're ordering, and what's coming to you.<//text>

<Text>Don't get what all the hype is.. sushi was good but nothing exceptional. I've had better in Vancouver. Price is quite high too; it isn't really worth it to me. If you happen to be in LA and really crave Japanese food it’ll do the job, but don’t expect a mind blowing experience.</Text>< Pictures>

Intimate setting. Friendly staff. Provide booster seat for kids. Sushi is fresh and they serve items in sequence so you can finish one item before starting another one. Menu is simple and straightforward. Would have loved a bit more variety and an open kitchen.<//text>

Only reason I’m going with 4 stars is because it leaves you wanting a little more... food quality is excellent though< /review>

< Review>
I've never had a bad experience at sugarfish! They have earned their reputation as one of the best sushi joints in town. Very reasonable prices considering the quality of the fish. Make sure to sign up for their birthday list, so you can eat free on your birthday if you go at least twice that year.< /Review>

This is some high quality sushi... Trust me! No, really... Order the Trust Me. It's worth the high price. Listen to your waiter/waitress. Don't use soy sauce for those that don't need it. This is good stuff.<//text>

It is very annoying waiting at a restaurant for an hour or more just to get s table. But overall this is a fantastic restaurant worth every penny.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>We were seated as an incomplete party before being scolded by management that they normally don’t seat incomplete parties. Either train your employees better to enforce such a policy even not during peak times when there are plenty of tables, or don’t enforce it during times when it doesn’t make any common or business sense. We still ordered drinks and appetizers while waiting but felt so unwelcome. Not the way to do business, no matter how good the food may be. Service is everything, and because of that, I would not recommend coming here, nor would I return.< /Review><Date>1529342175278< /Date>< user_name>

Easily the best sushi I have had in LA.  It's a little pricey but definitely worth it.  Beware, after eating at this place, it's hard to go back to mediocre sushi.  This location also gets very busy during peak hours and there is sometimes a wait to be seated.</review>

<Review>I love the "trust me" at this place!

even the takeout has a fantastic box that is custom for this dish, the box only complements and already super delicious sushi offering.

Is a lot better to dine in as they serve worm rice with the sushi the the hot/cold mix if delightful!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Gets busy at lunch time, but they are fast... very high quality! The location is super clean, nice modern look... Great for Lunch by your self, a group of Friends, business meeting, or a date with a Beautiful person! All the sushi is great, and the if you like rolls try the lobster roll Im addicted to it, there is lots of parking around, sometimes a short walk, but more than worth it! Hands down best sushi in LA you have to try it, Guaranteed you wont be disappointed.... and you will find your self craving it again a few days later, I could eat here every day! Pricing is Fair but by no means cheap... im a big guy usually spend $30-$40 by my self... but sushi is only $4-$7, I think the Roll is $14... keep in mind the include tip in your meal, so no need to figure it out! Easy, Friendly, Amazing! Try it, you wont be sorry!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

You honestly just can't find better sushi anywhere. Best case scenario, you might.... And that's a big might, find sushi that is just as good.< /Text>

There are so many better sushi restaurants with true sushi masters. Been to there Marina del Rey location too.
Sugarfish is for those who have never eaten real sushi in Japan or South Korea.
Don't follow the masses who lead you a stray. Try the smaller hole in the wall sushi places with sushi masters who will leave you amazed.

Sugarfish restaurants are overpriced, lousy food served by pretentious staff.<//Text>

Can I have Sugarfish every single day. We came here on Sunday with a group of friends. We were seated within 30 minutes. This place is a little bit more smaller than all the other locations. Last time I tried Trust Me. I decided to try The Nozawa and I am obsessed. It was beyond my expectations. Sugarfish has the most freshest fish. The service is outstanding. I can't wait to check out the Calabasas location next!!!<//review>

In the land of sushi on every corner, this is a must-try. Something just a little different than your average place. Not "upscale" like a Nobu, more "fast food" but in a seriously good way. I'd go there just for the rice alone. Make sure to get "chef's choice" and you won't be disappointed.<//review>

<text>While I have been to sushi places that have superior sushi, this is by far the best sushi chain and with very good quality sushi, especially for the price. Once you start trying sushi of this caliber, it's hard eating sushi of lower quality; it's just not the same. Aside from from the food being delicious, the service was great and the waiter was very attentive. The wait can get long though, and the parking lot is tiny so be prepared to find street parking.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp><rate>5</rate>< userid>

The staff inside the restaurant was super friendly. However the mexican at the front was very rude and had headphones in and is unfortunate that he picks and chooses which patrons to offer excellent service. As a latino male I always find it offensive when the hired help at an establishment I patronize is racist. I would talk to the mexican valet and inform him if you’re getting paid to valet, treat all customers as you would a white customer</Review>< pics>

Having been to Japan and having great sushi, I found myself thinking "yes, this is obviously great sushi, but...we have Sugarfish at home."  This is up there as the best sushi I've ever had.  Renowned sushi chef's go on record as to say the most important part of sushi is the rice, and Sugarfish shines.  The warm rice takes this sushi to the next level.<//Review>

<date>1535993380097< /date><Rate>4</Rate><Review>Easy to order menu. The trustme (omakase style) is just about the right portion size to leave you full but not overly stuffed. The fish selection may change so dont get too attached to what you see on the online menus. The fish is pretty good, so you may want to add a few pieces once your courses are completed. The Nozawa super dry sake comes in an 6 oz bottle. Fills ~3 1/2 sake cups, so plan accordingly so your 4th doesn't feel left out.

Not a huge space so the wait time for a table can be a bit long. Valet parking in the small plaza is $5, but you can find parking on a side street pretty readily.<//Review>< Pictures>

One thing I learned was to stop being a cheap ass. Usually, I would go to local Japanese restaurant and would spend a certain amount and would regret it. The quality of the fish wasnt good, and if had gone to another restaurant (Sugarfish) I would spend a few bucks more, but I would leave the restaurant happier and more satisfied. My point here is if you are looking for quality and service and got a few buck more to spend on food, this is the place!</review>

<Text>I'm here right now, visiting from New York. Can't believe what I just paid $80 for and going to stop somewhere on the way out for real food. Very overpriced, can't even pick up the sushi (it falls apart) and the balls to charge $3 if you ask for more ginger, they don't even give you enough for what you order! Go to Katsu-ya instead. Much better value. Avoid this trap like the plague.< /Text>< Pictures>

Been here twice and got the "Trust Me". Loved itttt. The rice is warm and the fish is high quality melt in your mouth goodness. Sometimes there is a wait- but it is worth it. Sign up for their bday program to get a free meal!< /Text>

Fresh and delicious sushi.  It's clear to me the Head Sushi Chef has taken the time to personally select the fish it's serving it's customers.  On the pricey side, but compared to higher priced places like Nobu, Sugarfish is even better.</review>

<Review>Oh, Sugarfish, you have really lost your way.

Once you had semi-delicious fish, now your quality has fallen off the Mariana's Trench.

The majority of the pieces on my last visit had little to no flavor. One had an undeniable funk. Another lead to a member of my table having a bout of food poisoning. The pieces with flavor only had a taste because of the ponzu sauce bath they underwent—which was not helpful in the least.

Also, what is the purpose of serving unseasoned edamame?

Your Studio City location also has a distinct lack of any visual style with an aesthetic that feels more kitsch than refined.

How this restaurant still justifies its price tag with such low quality fish and construction is beyond me.< /Review>< Pics>

Love Sugarfish! The fish is always so fresh and the rice is perfectly warm. I also like that I don't need to spend time wondering what to order cuz I just get the "trust me" -- can't go wrong! (Note: this is legit sushi and not the trendy AYCE style of rolls stuffed with a ton of stuff)< /text>

UPDATE: This review is for Sushi Nozawa and not Sugarfish. I don't care much for the Sugarfish experience... - Simply amazing sushi. This place has a very limited menu made up from the finest quality ingredients. Nozawa really knows how to pick the best fish off the boat. I have eaten here more than 20 times and each time is just as good as the first time. The service is quick and to the point. From experience I have almost always had a smaller bill than other fine sushi establishment and I'm sure this is because of the limited menu items. Be sure to get the salmon skin rolls, best i've ever had.<//Text>

<text>Heard all these great things about Sugarfish. Boy, what a disappointment. We went on Saturday 10/7/17 6:45 pm, not an unusual night to go to dinner.  Starting with the sake, they only had a third of what was listed on the menu. Then moving to the sashimi, they only had one fish that was listed on the menu. As for sushi it was the same no uni, hamachi etc. My party and I will not be going back to Sugarfish. Even the little sushi bar in my town keeps it's menu stocked!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Rude, rude, rude! Sushi was terrible and smelled funny. Was forced to eat boring chef's choice. Tried to force us to eat a minimum of 4 orders @ $12/order.
Would never EVER go back to this place again or recommend it to anyone who has even a slight knowledge of sushi.< /Review>

another great sushi spot and this is not your typical sushi, it is strictly traditional sushi a heaven for sashimi lovers indeed. I recommend trying the: Trust Me selection of the main menu, you can't go wrong with that any who has true appreciation for grade A sushi and is a fan of Jiro (Japanese Sushi Chef) you will love this place.</text>

I've been in all Sugarfish locations (in LA at least), and this one seems to be the oldest. Chief and kitchen skills are on par, if not better than the other locations, service is great too, but parking and the noise level sucks a big NOISY time.<//review>

No hot saki, marginal quality. Atmosphere is not pleasant. Given the benefit of the doubt this is a sushi place, it smells pretty fishy. Glade plugins or something...<//Text>

< Review>
I think everyone knows their "Trust Me" dish. I came twice, one time for dinner and lunch. Dinner was maybe 5 mins wait on a weekday and lunch we havent had to wait. It is a small restaurant so there's a possibility of having to wait for a table. The last time I went for lunch they had left a SUGARFISH BIRTHDAY REWARDS PROGRAM card. My birthday was coming up so I sure did sign up! The way this program works is you have to leave their your contact info and if you come 2 times before your bday on your birthdate you qualify for a free "Trust ME" on your bday. Not sure if many know about it but I did tell my bf to sign up. It seems that each time you have to fill out the card and they will record it on your account. I'm excited to go back a second time so I can qualify for my free BIRTHDAY Trust me! I live right across the street so it definitely will not be hard to come on my bday :)</Review>

<text>There are a few things that have altered my entire understanding of sushi. The movie Giro Dreams of Sushi which highlights the Edo-Style strictly adhered to at  Sushi Nozawa and less so here at Sugarfish. With Sushi Nozawa now closed and the Nozawa Bar a little out of my price range Sugarfish has become my go for Omakase Edo-style sushi until I save enough money to fly to Japan.

I have always had immense respect for the care, skill and preparation that is involved in creating sushi at it's highest levels. All too often in my hometown our sleepy surfer vibe gets in the way over saucing rolls, losing all the nuances and purity.

Small. All of Kazunori's restaurants are small. Design is traditional, clean, uncluttered.

You will not find any rolls like the Las Vegas roll, Rainbow or anything that's beyond traditional, highlighting the fish. The rice is served warm to almost melt the cool fish without cooking it. The Toro and Blue Crab are my favorites, not sure why the cucumber roll is almost as expensive as the other rolls. They are not overstuffed pine cone's when it comes to the hand rolls. Tight and the roasted seaweed ensures the full effect and flavor profile.

I wasn't a fan of the sashimi as it's small, and I found the oyster sashimi kind of mushed, I prefer either shooters or half shelled. I was digging the organic edamame.

Uni is overpriced, but the nozawa style shrimp is pretty good value. All the tuna's are excellent, but I wish they offered grades within the toro designation. Salmon is perfectly firm. On my last trip they had monkfish liver which was the freshest I've ever had and the standard by which many sushi nuts rate restaurants.

The Trust Me Menu's are very reasonable and not meant to stuff you. These are the dinner's you should be getting. The lite has shrimp while the standard has quite a few other offerings like blue crab hand roll and halibut instead of the shrimp. TheNozawa is kind of the best of both adding snapper and the daily special nigiri. They do these to go which is great. They don't substitute and warn of this up front. No extra sauces, salt or additional rice.

I like their Nozawa sake which goes well with Orion, but for the real value go with the Ryo as the Hakkaisan is pricey at $3.50 per oz. I find it hard drinking Sapporo when the rest of the meal is so high.

Service is deliberate, inviting, but not catering or accommodating which I think at this level is understandable. Sugarfish follow in the footsteps of the original restaurant that pretty much educated California about edo and omakase. Nazi or not, it's not for everyone. They will not compromise their art and for those that want to go to Giro have the next best thing here in Sugarfish.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2be1386e3a105:0x163808889f1de3ce< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Entrance is a bit hidden. But it's there!
Valet parking for $5 or park at a meter.
Small location, so get there early. Not recommended for groups larger than 4.</review>
