Best place if you like billiards. The table is clean and it's a alcohol and smoke free environment.</Text>

I was looking for a billiards place that allowed minors (my youngest is 12) to enter and I found this place. Four of us got a table for $15/hr and we played a while and had a great time. It wasn't crowded at all, music played all the while, and it wad a lot of fun. The tables are good. I don't remember if they serve food but some packaged snacks are available. We will definitely return.</review>

<Review>Cues Billard was perfect! We loved the smoke free alcohol free environment. The only thing I would change is the uncensored music. But other than that it was absolutely fabulous!<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<resp>None< /resp><Review>The staff is very nice and so is the atmosphere. There are a lot of tables, good music playing, and nice lighting.

The price however was pretty high at $15/hr and the tables need to be resurfaced.

It's an overall good place if money and quality of tables is not an important issue.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

<Review>If you like pool this IS the place.  Clean.  Good tables.  Plus two DIAMOND tables. They charge a bit more for diamond.  Nice people.  Not crowded at all.  Took my 17yo son here and had a good time.  Would definitely come back again<//Review>< pictures>

Very clean establishment. Looks like a family run business and they all seem to be nice enough people. Seems to me they could take a few tables out and make a little more room because I've never seen it crowded enough to warrant so many tables. Nice place to take the family and do something a little different.</review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>Pool tables are in excellent condition however they are bunched together which ultimately means be aware of other pool gamers around also no food or alcohol selection just snacks. Also I noticed that you can hear everyone's conversation around you low music and prices are high.

First off the owner needs a little more training in customer service. I had just finished my job for the day and was going to meet some friends to play some pool i arrived first and needed to use the bathroom as i entered cues i started for the bathroom thats when i encountered the owner of cues he asked me if  i was there with someone and i said no then he rudely asked "then what are you doing" and i said that i was going to use the bathroom and before i could say anything else he yells no the bathroom is not for the public I've never been more discussed with a business owner in my life just because i decided to try and use the bathroom before i rented a table the owner assumed i wasn't there to play so he used to embarrassing and humiliation tactics in front of the custumers to get me to leave and you know what it work and will never step foot in that place again and would hope that no one else would want to play pool in a place where you have to worry if your going to be the next person to get verbally attacked by the owner i recommend that nobody go to this place to show him that this is what happens when you treat your customers this way.<//Review>

Also, they charge by the table, not per person, so it is the best price in town especially if you have a party of 4.<//Text><GmapID>0x80db8aa52968132b:0x24e7a1e7abab26ad</GmapID><Time>1454389817753<//Time><UserId.>114150908152360199063<//UserId.><Name>Brian D</Name></record></dataset><record>

<review>A little pricey, 20$/hr for a good table, 15$/hr for a not so good table. The cues are a little sub par for a pool hall and the balls have some chips in them. But it's also the only pool hall in town so for having zero competition, it's not too bad.<//review>< Pictures>

If you decide to go here make sure and track your time.

I called my buddy to ask if he wanted to play pool at 7:15. Drove to his house to pick him up then headed to the pool hall and played one game. When we left the guy up front charged me for a half hour and said we had been there since 7:10. When I realized what had happened I confronted the guy and he gave me a few dollars back but did not own up to the mistake.

I used to love going in and playing one game every once in a while. It totally ruins the experience getting ripped off even once.<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent service! A little expensive but the advantage is that it is not like the bars in that there is a creidillo who thinks he owns the table and you have to beat him to play a ratillo with your friends

Remember to support local! There are only 3 locally owned video game stores within a 30 mile radius and should always be chosen over the mainstream stores . Berto who works here is the real mvp who search’s the flea markets and finds the best games for the spot . Truly a great employee and a good place to spend your money locally .</text>

<review>Came to pick up Mario 3D All-Stars the other day and it was a smooth transaction. I’ve been a customer at Gamers in Control for years and I’m glad to see that the store is thriving and doing well! The store Has really great social media presence and the profile admins are quick to reply back to DM’s!

Should definitely check their store out and their Instagram page @thegic !</review>< pictures>

Not only did they offer me a better deal on my used games then GameStop, their selection of games though not always focused on mainstream(Don’t get me wrong they have that too) is AMAZING. Everyone working there is super knowledgeable and nice. Whether your looking for a hard to find game or collectible, sell your used games, or buy a new one I’d highly recommend the drive to check this place out.<//review>

Store is very well run. Friendly staff and helpful service. However be warned that there is a SEVERE funko pop infestation. They cover entire walls in the place and are a definite health hazard. The natural predators are not enough to keep the insane breeding habits of the pops in check. Would recommend a deep store cleaning; must remove all traces of funko company product to ensure the pops do not reseed and spread all over again. Otherwise a high quality local store.<//Review>

As soon as I walked in, I found two games that I've been looking for, forever. The gentleman that was working the place was really cool and friendly. Makes you feel welcome as soon as you walk in.
Looking forward to coming back sometime in the near future.<//Review><gmapID>0x808dff111597b16b:0x88328bc445c2b645< /gmapID></record>

STOP BY GAMERS IN CONTROL IF YOU'RE THINKING OF GOING TO GAMESTOP.  YOU'LL FIND BETTER DEALS AND BETTER VINTAGE CONSOLES AND GAMES!!!< /Review>< user>

<text>A great store with lots of classic gaming goodness to offer. Prices are fair and reasonable as well, which makes things even better. They also have a large variety of Funko Pops available. Prices vary on the Pops, but they too seem very reasonable as well. Locally owned too, which is even nicer. The only downside is the place feels a little too small. That's my only complaint, but that's not their fault.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
The perfect example of a locally-owned game store - friendly, knowledgeable, full of unusual titles, and reasonably priced. It's refreshing to see a gaming shop that still focuses on games, and not marginally - related merchandise.</Review>

<review>Fun place, went there for a birthday party. However, It should be geared towards older kids. (11 and up) Depending on what age group is there should determine what type of music to play.  We were there with kinder kids and had to ask them to change the vulgar music.< /review><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808dff111597b16b:0x88328bc445c2b645</Gmap_id>< Pics>

They wouldn't let me return my item. They sold me a Japanese power adapter. It was for my Sega Genesis. Horrible customer service. Every time I went in the store I was ignored and felt unwelcome. This was all when they were next to Blaze bagels.</text>

<text>The owner Aaron here is really knowledgeable about games. I have shopped here a few times and been able to enjoy games I bought here at excellent prices, and sell them on amazon when i’m done. I have yet to find a game that felt over priced. These are pieces of history after all at this point in time and everyone I have bought from this shop work excellent. If you are looking for thrift store prices this isn’t the place, these games are tested and clean working examples of vintage gaming history.
Aaron if you see this,
I still need
-Mario Kart SNES-
-Streets Of Rage 2
-SuperBoy

Update!

We had a long awaited package to be delivered today which is Friday, between 1 and 5pm.  We received notification that it had been delivered at 4:36pm which it was not.  We received another notification at 4:43pm that the delivery address was not correct so they were not able to deliver.  I called customer service at approx. 6:15pm to assure them that the address they had was in fact the correct address and gave them information on how to find my house because I was assuming the driver could not see the one foot tall house numbers on my fence right at the end of my driveway, or the 6 inch gold, shiny numbers on my house at the front porch.    The woman I was speaking to called someone that could relay delivery instructions to the driver and asked me for a good contact number.  I gave my house number and was told they would call in the next hour to confirm.   Apparently they called my cell phone instead, which was on the original shipment information.  My cell phone was not working at the time, which is why I gave a GOOD contact phone number.   I called customer service again after i received another notification that they had tried to contact me.   This time I was told that they would upgrade this situation to the highest customer service priority and that i would be contacted by 10am MONDAY!!

How is this the highest customer service that I can receive to have to wait another 3 days for this situation to be resolved, let alone to find out when it will possibly be delivered to the CORRECT address, WHICH WAS CORRECT IN THE FIRST PLACE?!!!!!!!!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

<review>These guys drive through our parking lots like it’s a freeway. They always get packages mixed up, they even lie about packages being delivered. I’m not sure why they would lie other than Amazon pays them when it’s delivered, I don’t know but someone needs to check these guys. It’s obvious that someone has lost control of this company.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80832622726b9beb:0xa426235e88fa0cd5</GmapID></record>

Had an initial shipping snafu, called to clear things up, had a message sent to the local UPS center, had a call back in under 5 minutes, cleared things up and got my package back on track.

In reading one star reviews I get the feeling that some people don't understand the complexities involved in shipping, tracking, and delivering millions of packages daily. In two plus decades of shipping, I've never lost a package or had an issue that couldn't be resolved with a few phone calls. The same applies to FedEx.

WARNING: OneTrac is hands down the worst delivery company. Maybe a solid 3 out of 10 in war torn Syria but an abysmal failure in America.< /text>

<text>We waited all day Fri. Jan. 20 for a delivery needing a signature.  The UPS driver finally dropped off the package at 5:45 p.m.without obtaining a signature.  The delivered merchandise was quite valuable.  The customer who sent the package should receive a refund for the cost of the signature confirmation.  Very, very disappointing and frustrating.  This is one example of why we never ship anything by UPS.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80832622726b9beb:0xa426235e88fa0cd5< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
CHICO CALIFORNIA UPS HIRES THIEVES TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO FEDEX.

WHATEVER YOU DO IM WARNING YOU, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS STOREFRONT OR DRIVERS THEY STEAL PACKAGES AND CLAIM THEY DELIVERED THE PACKAGE TO YOUR HOME. IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME CHECK THE NEWS!

I WAS HOME ALL DAY WAITING FOR UPS I DID NOT GET A KNOCK AT MY DOOR NOR DID I RECEIVE MY PACKAGE. I DIDNT EVEN RECEIVE A PHONE CALL. THE UPS DRIVER CLAIMED THEY DROPPED OFF MY PACKAGE WITH A RANDOM STRANGER WHO WAS SUPPOSEDLY STANDING OUTSIDE MY HOUSE BUT LITTLE DID THEY KNOW I WAS HOME ALL DAY SO THAT IS A LIE I WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF SOMEONE WAS OUTSIDE MY HOUSE, BECAUSE THE SURVEILLANCE WOULD HAVE NOTIFIED ME ALSO THE PACKAGE HANDLER "CLAIMED" HE LET THE RANDOM STRANGER SIGN FOR THE PACKAGE THAT SPECIFICALLY WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE SIGNED BY ME. NOW ISN'T THAT SKETCHY? THIS WILL BE THEIR RESPONSE BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE REPORTED THIS SAME ISSUE IN THE COMMENTS BELOW "UPS Sales Associates do not handle deliveries, we simply receive Mail & Packages for Our Mailbox Holders. we will definitely relay your message to the Chico Hub, who are responsible for all incoming and outgoing transactions and delivery routes in Chico. Thank you for your time, hope this message finds you in good health." THEY WILL SAY THIS BUT DON'T DO ANYTHING. IM NOT THE TYPE TO LEAVE REVIEWS BUT THIS ONE REALLY PISSED ME OFF.

THIS BUSINESS (STOREFRONT) HIRES THIEVES AND LIARS!

I HOPE THE PACKAGE HANDLER AND EVERYONE INVOLVED READS THIS AND QUIT THEIR JOB BECAUSE NOW A FULL EMBEZZLEMENT INVESTIGATION IS BEING OPENED UP ON THIS STOREFRONT BY UPS AND WALMART. THIS IS A FEDERAL CRIME. YOU WILL BE CAUGHT I PROMISE ALSO MY ATTORNEYS WILL BE LOOKING INTO THIS AS WELL. ENJOY PRISON.</review>

Missed a delivery at my Chico Ofc. One quick call to customer srvc to change the address to meet tomorrow's 2nd delivery attempt was easily done with help of a nice lady agent.
ThankYou UPS!</Review>

Five days to deliver what USPS delivers in two, followed by lazy drivers that can't be bothered to deliver to a neighbor or lock in an adjacent car, let alone leave at a private door.</review>

The worst place to eat and terrible customer service.  I did to go a bowl and when I opened it, the food was stinking. On emailing them about stale and unhealthy food being served, they did not reply nor did they answer any call. The bowl went straight in my trash.<//Text>

This place should not be catering at all. I'm currently waiting on a last-minute pizza order for our office because Poke Supreme dropped the ball (3rd time) and our order (placed with the owner) didn't make it to their staff, supposedly...probably another lie. There's plenty of other Poke places to try, take your sushi craving to another restaurant that cares about your food and your experience, I'll do the same.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>I found Poke Supreme through Groupon and I stopped by to make a to go lunch order. The restaurant was clean and simple. The parking was relatively easy with no crazy crowds. I let them know right away I was planning on using a Groupon and they were kind to explain the different discounts available and which could or could not be combined.  Since I had a least two other orders along with mine that I was picking up for others, they were very patient to take down all the info to make the custom orders. We also ordered a couple of Spam musubi's and they custom made them so they were nice and hot instead of being reheated. The Poki Bowls had multiple size options, but the main difference is the amount of protein/fish but the physical bowl was the same. The staff was very attentive and even took care of us when we asked for ice water.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>I usually never leave reviews, but I've also never been in a restaurant that doesn't want customers this badly. They actually turned away 4 customers 15 mins before they closed. If you close at 7:45 say you close at 7:45 not 8. The one lady working there was rude rude rude. She got my order wrong then had an attitude about fixing it. We got there an hour before they were closing and they were out of messago and avocado. I mean come on, it's a sushi place. It was literally 79 degrees in the restaurant (I took a peek at the thermostat) and everyone was fanning themselves with whatever they had.

I've been here a few times and this last time was so awful I'll choose another one of the 1000 poke restaurants in fremont. Groupon is so not worth this treatment.<//Review>< Pics>

Amazing chill environment & great food! Staff needs a little work though and can be a little disorganizing to follow order on the screen, especially to look at what kind of sauces to apply.

At least a sauce menu on the window. At least something within eyelevel would help.</Text>

<review>The food was better than it looked... selection looks pretty sparse and as though it just opened (6 months ago). But the bowls weren't bad. 2-scoop bowls are $9.95. I wasn't fond of the spicy tuna.

Yay for:
-good sauces
-good variety of toppings
-they mix the sauce with fish but not everything so your bowl isn't soggy

Wishlist:
-prices posted (no prices listed anywhere inside)
-back support for the chairs
-more veggies
-that the rice wasn't hot (a weird mix with the cold ingredients)</review><username>Joni Yee</username>< Pics>

Food quality and Customer service is number one priority here. I've never been to a Poké spot that treats you and answers all your silly questions. You even see them preparing everything compared to other places where it's all hidden and you don't know how the food is prepped. I recommend!<//Text>

It was only alright. Was expecting a little better going by the reviews this place has been receiving. But I did show up 10 mins before closing on the Sunday of the Super Bowl. The preparer might've mentally checked out by the time I got there</text>

Disappointed. Tried it for the first time. I usually go to poki run on calaveras. Their large poki salad seems very very very very small. I will not recommend this place to friend and my kids friends ☹☹☹. Maybe they are skimming on the portions for more profit<//text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Cute, quiet Poke place with lots of open space. Service was ok and the food was not bad. You can build your own bowl, or they had 2 popular options for you to choose from. I decided to build my own 3 scoop poke, for $11 (appx pre-tax). I had salmon, shoyu tuna and scallops. They also had a spicy tuna choice and a couple others. Toppings again were more limited than other poke places I've been to, but not bad and sauce variety was ok as well. I added lemon-yuzu and shoyu into my bowl, as well as unagi, ponzu and a spicy mayo sauce to top it all off (yes, I like my food saucy). You can have all of that on top of white rice (not sushi rice... booo), brown rice or a salad. Over all the portion was decent and toppings were ok, so I'd say it's pretty average.

However, their supreme masubi was pretty darn good (saucy, you see a pattern?). haha I liked it a lot and would definitely recommend trying it, if you like more flavorful spam masubis.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>Great selection and bargains right now.  Bought a hundred dollar rain coat.  Was able to use my veteran I'D plus their 40% discount. Cost was around $60 after taxes.  Nice personnel very courteous and friendly.   Recommend shopping there.

<text>(Translated by Google) Very friendly staff. We arrived at a fairly late hour and despite the closure, they allowed us to make fittings.
Prices are in the bottom of the range. Ask to collect vouchers (with the application), which will allow you to have additional discounts.
Store neat, tidy and very clean.
Easy access for people with reduced mobility. #wheelchairaccessible

If useful notice, please put a 👍

Personnel très aimable. Nous sommes arrivés à une heure assez tardive et malgré la fermeture, ils nous ont permis de faire des essayages.
Les prix sont dans le bas de la fourchette. Demandez à récupérer des vouchers (avec l'application), ce qui vous permettra d'avoir des remises supplémentaires.
Magasin soigné, bien rangé et très propre.

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>This company is awesome. They are super fair on pricing and I promise you will not find anyone else that will work with you like he does. I called around multiple places trying to get my charger port fixed. He had it fixed/replaced within 15 minutes. I called another store they wanted 79$ for the same thing he did for 20$. Very honest and reliable he will come to you or you can meet him, the owner is 100% legit and very reasonable and I would recommend him to fix any phone any time. I promise you will not find a nicer and more helpful company than quality fix. Thanks again Nore for
your help.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
i called & set up a whole appointment for 2pm sent my address & name for this guy to say he’s running late to never show up or answer any of my texts. if you couldn’t make it you should’ve set a different day instead of ghosting. i’m sure there’s more professional places....< /Review>

This place is horrible!!!
I don’t think this place is even legal as they don’t give any receipts, they don’t have have any permits and no sales tax are being paid and I’m still looking into it.
Very poor service and very rude person. Fixed my $1200 phone and messed it all up. They keep hanging up the phone when we are calling them. Be carful and don’t waste your money!</review>

Please advise they will cost you more down the road.
They came and charged me $100 for a screen replacement and now my keyboard doesn’t work and my phone is Pixelated on the screen.
He refuses to fix my phone and the screen that he replaced for me is already cracked again from the smallest incident dropping it on CARPET.
This is how my keyboard ty in es now d ya fan t up tryin gym to ty up e f a set.

What I tried to type was “this is how my keyboard types now if i try to type fast “.
Save your money and go elsewhere.

Update: Tells me to contact him and just keeps me on read an ignored phone calls.</Text>

<Text>Very upset !  This guy fixed my iPhone 7 but broke my home screen button and said it was already broken when given to him however it was it I explained it was working properly before the phone was given to him then he said it was due to water damage I stated to him I never took it into the restroom when I showered then he said it was the aftermarket screen he could have used So whatever I let it go I didn’t bother I said OK well just as long as my screen works I’m fine so two days pass and my phone blacked out the screen goes black and turns on two minutes later the next day it turns off again but for good and remember this company provides a two month warranty supposedly because when I called them and asked if he could do something to help me fix my screen because of my warranty was still good  so whatever I let it go I didn’t bother I said OK well just as long as my screen works I’m fine so two days pass and my phone blacked out the screen goes black and turns on two minutes later the next day it turns off again but for good and remember this company provides a two month warranty supposedly because when I called them and asked if he could do something to help me fix my screen because of my warranty was still good  he said he could fix the screen but for $60 again that’s what I paid for the first time for my screen to be fixed and he wants to charge me again due to his malfunction from the aftermarket screens he use to fix my phone when I brought up the fact I had my warranty still he still said it was going to be $60   What is the point of the two month warranty just so they can get you in to do business and take your money when they don’t actually have a two month warranty My screen now is not cracked that is the only thing that will void the warranty. I do not recommend this place to anybody they just take your money and brainwash you about the goods and services when they don’t provide an accurate warranty so when you go back to fix it again like they know you will they can charge you again and you will fall into their whole and keep going< /Text><Time>1539843560473< /Time>< username>

< Review>
RUINED MY IPHONE 7 AND COST ME $150 IN PARTS.

I had my phone screen replaced after reading the positive online reviews.  When I got the phone back, the screen and body were separating and it was missing the speaker cover!  The tech said he couldn't get the glue to stick and I should get a "good case" to hold the phone together.   I called in back 2 days later because the screen and body were almost completely separated.    At that point the same tech took it and and applied superglue to the lcd screen.

When I saw the screen still sticking up, and I could hear the glue making a clicking noise with every touch, I told him I wasn't happy, and I wanted it fixed.  The tech said absolutely not, no refunds, and he wasn't going to fix it.

VERY DISAPPOINTED I DON’T RECOMMEND AT ALL!< /Review>

I can't believe how fast and professional the Quality Fix 4less was. I dropped my iPhone s6 and the screen was CRACKED ALL OVER and i called Quality Fix 4less. He came so quick and in less than 10mins he fixed it, And even trew me a case at %50 off!! I  highly Recommend the QF4Less to anyone in the area.

I have no recollection other than everyone being super nice and accommodating to me before and after the procedure. Dr. Smith called me at home to make sure that I'm alright and I can call the practice any time with any question or concern I have. I like the service, the staff and Dr. Smith and encourage everyone, especially those who are terrified of dentists to visit Dr. Smith and see for yourself.

<Review>I came to Dr. Smith needing sedation dentistry because novocain wasn’t working for me. The staff was extremely helpful and kind and made sure I was comfortable the entire time. Every appointment is amazing and I no longer am afraid to go to the dentist.< /Review>< Pics>

WOW I can't believe how amazing this office is! I was shaking with anxiety when I first showed up to my appointment. The receptionist was so nice, almost as soon as I filled out my paperwork Melissa called me back. I was terrified but within just a couple of minutes Melissa had me laughing. She took x-rays, which I was not looking forward to but she worked very quick, with care, and efficient. Dr. Rob was very informative, and with Melissa they discussed my teeth, and different routes I might take to get a healthy smile once again. Melissa went over what my insurance covers, and what I'll be paying. They both walked me through everything, and explained everything in terms I could understand. We discussed my concerns, my options, and didn't push any work I wasn't concerned with. It was the only time I've felt like a dentist office had my best interest in hand. This office is how all healthcare offices should be. They are there for the patient, for YOU. I HIGHLY recommend everyone Dr. Rob Smith DDS to everyone that needs any dental care. I'm so excited for my next appointment.< /text>

I have always been afraid of the dentist until I found Dr. Rob Smith. I am always comfortable walking into his office. Melissa is fantastic at creating a dental plan that works within my budget and making sure I understand everything that is happening. Novocain alone doesn't work for me. I need the sedation for any kind of drilling work. I definitely recommend making an appointment if you have any fears of the dentist or you are looking for sedation dentistry. I recently moved to Visalia, but I still drive to Fresno to see Dr. Smith because it is worth it! I won't go anywhere else!< /Text>

<review>By far the best Dental Office around! The staff are absolutely fantastic! So extremely grateful to of found Dr. Smith! Will never go to another dentist after my experience.

I, Like most people, just sitting in a dentist chair is one of the most nerve racking things imaginable. However, I was absolutely astounded how welcoming and comforting my entire experience was. Just walking in the front door, the staff all greeted me with a smile and really went above any beyond to make sure is was as relaxed and comfortable as possible. Dr. Smith did not rush anything, was extremely calming, and informative about my procedure. Sure enough the procedure went great and virtually painless.

Once the procedure was finished, My recovery time was quick. I truly cannot speak highly enough about everyone in the office. Please, if you're like me and have extreme anxiety about going to a dentist, definitely go to this dentist.</review><user>102178531135132749666<//user>< rating>

I am in my late thirties and have been avoiding getting any dental work done as I am terrified of the dentist. I found Dr Smith online and I made an appointment as Dr. Smith specializes in sedation and works with people who have fears of the dentist. Upon arriving to my appointment, the office is beautiful and clean. The front desk employees were so friendly and welcoming. I had a consultation with Melissa and she is amazing! She was very patient with me. Dr Smith came into the consultation to go over my treatment plan and was very thorough and constantly reassuring me that I will be taken care of. I left the office excited and looking forward to my appointment to get work done. This will be my second time I will be getting work done by Dr Smith and I no longer have fear of the dentist!

I just wanted to drop a line to express my thanks to Dr. Smith, Melissa, and the rest of the staff.  On my initial consultation, Melissa was very thorough in explaining all that needed to be done and my options, working within my budget.

Generally, I am very anxious when it comes to any dental work.  My appointment yesterday was not at all what I expected.  Dr. Smith and the staff were phenomenal.  I had many different things addressed yesterday, all with no discomfort.  My anxieties were quickly put to rest and the experience was a pleasant one.

I will be sure to refer all of my friends and family to my new dentist.

Thanks again,< /review>

< review>
When my kids were growing up, they had a wonderful, gentle dentist.  He retired and their next dentist, it turns out, was not gentle and left them with lasting fears.  By the time I found out about it, they had serious anxiety around going to the dentist for even the most routine procedures.  Fast forward to adulthood and we discovered they require some sedation in order to take care of their neglected dental health.  Dr. Smith has treated both kids and I'm grateful for how seriously he and his staff are about making the experience as trauma-free as possible.  My daughter has gotten more relaxed after several years of seeing Dr. Smith and is now better able to handle her fears.  My son recently had an anxiety attack during a deep cleaning and staff was very understanding and worked with him to allow him to return for a second try, but with sedatives to relax him enough to tolerate the lengthy procedure.  He seemed quite relieved after his second visit and as a result, is more relaxed about future work.  These small miracles are possible through Dr. Smith's and his staff's sympathetic focus on their patients' individual needs and fears.  Thank you Dr. Smith and staff for your kind care.</review>

I am so thankful for finding Dr. Smith! The reviews are what sold me. I can't say enough good things about him and his staff. I had put off going to the dentist for years and years and just lived with pain until I couldn't handle it anymore. That's when I made the call. Melissa was great a spent a few hours going over everything with me and putting together a treatment plan to start taking care of everything I had going on. I have had 2 emergency appointments as well and they were able to get me right in and take care of me. Thank you Dr. Smith and staff.</text>

I had my wisdom teeth removed by Dr.Smith and had a wonderful experience with a quick recovery. Melissa was incredibly kind and thorough during my initial consultation/X-Ray, instantly calming any nerves I had. Each person in this office was very professional and gave off a warm, caring energy that took away any potential anxieties I had going into my procedure. This is the only dental office I have ever gone to that has made me feel completely comfortable and unafraid. I felt genuinely cared about as a patient, and Dr.Smith checked up on me during the week to make sure all was well. I hope to only come here for dental work from now on. Special thanks to this team!</Review>

Normally I'm not a fan of doing anything medical-related (dentistry included) but Dr. Smith, his office, and all of his staff are all so welcoming and friendly that you forget you're even at the dentist. I had all four of my wisdom teeth surgically removed by Dr. Smith, and a few hours after my procedure he called me personally to check in on how I was feeling, which I feel really shows that he actually cares about his patients. As for the procedure itself, they did great work and it went very smoothly with no complications in the following months. Hardly any swelling or pain. I highly recommend Dr. Smith to anyone considering becoming a patient here</review>

I would like to thank Dr. Smith, Melissa, and Bobette for the awesome care they have given me. The whole team is great to work with. I have felt relaxed and they have worked with me to get sedation when I have needed it. They really have gone the extra mile to make me feel less anxious about going to the dentist. I would recommend Dr. Smith and his team to any one who is afraid of going to the dentist.< /text>

<Review>I had been avoiding going to the dentist for years because I was so scared due to bad experiences with dentists in the past. When I found that I couldn't avoid it anymore, I was so happy that I came across Dr. Smith for my first visit back. Him and his staff are excellent at making patients who are afraid feel really relaxed, comfortable and informed. I have had a few procedures done now by Dr. Smith and I can't imagine going anywhere else.

Disappointed to see you throwing a CRNA under the bus for an “upgrade” to an MD or DDS. You have enough schooling and education to know a DDS with a certificate is no substitute for an experienced CRNA that manages airways and is trained in administering anesthesia. I’m willing to bet it all comes down to money. You might update your job listing so it isn’t so insulting and you look like a total jerk.</text>

I chose to go with Smith Sedation Dentistry because I was very interested in the sedation process. I get very anxious about going to the dentist so I thought to give this office a try. I went through the sedation process the first time because I was very anxious about having my dental work done so I knew that being sedated was the best route to take. I'm so happy that I decided to get sedated! I was very relaxed and calm the entire time. The staff was very attentive and nice during my sedation appointment. I would definitely recommend Smith Sedation Dentistry to anyone that wants a great dentist, super nice staff, and an anxious free dentist experience.<//Text>

I have a major fear of the dentist after several horrible experiences with other places. I finally got the courage to come in and they worked with me and got me through all the work I needed done. I was able to come in be sedated and happily I don't remember getting any work done (that's they way I want it). The staff is amazing and nice and they work with you can explain everything going on. I went in for a cleaning recently and it was the best cleaning I have ever had.< /Text>

<Text>I have been terrified of the dentist since a traumatic experience as a child. After more than 10 years of avoiding the dentist, my husband made me an appointment with Dr. Smith. From the first phone call with Melissa, through my latest appointment 2 years later, I have never felt uncomfortable. They listen to how you are feeling and act accordingly. Every step they take is talked about first, so there is no fear of the unknown. They have all gone above  and beyond in every interaction I have had with them. So grateful to have this compassionate group of people helping me navigate my dental issues.<//Text>< resp>

I have been going to Dr. Smith for about or over 10 years.  The Dr. and the staff always make me feel comfortable and very accommodating.  And if you're like me and have the fear, they do everything possible to remove that fear and do not judge in any way shape or form.  They are very understanding about how things and life happens.  I would highly recommend Dr. Smith and his very nice staff.<//text>

My fear of dentists kept me from keeping up on regular dental work for years. I got a referral to Dr. Smith and after meeting with Melissa I knew I was in good hands. Dr. Smith and Melissa were efficient with the exams and getting me set up with my appointment. Having the sedation option allowed me to go through with the dental work with confidence and a sense of relief. Thank you to all the wonderful staff and Dr. Smith for helping me face my fear!< /text>

I have extreme dental phobia and have had some horrible experiences with other dentists who specialize in sedation dentistry. From the moment I walked into the office, I was treated with such care and kindness. All of the staff are so genuinely attentive and kind. The day of my procedure, I was nervous of course, and they immediately brought me a nice big, warm, soft blanket to make me comfortable. It is amazing how such a simple gesture can provide so much comfort. The procedure went amazingly well and I am so happy with the results. Dr. Rob Smith was incredibly patient and thoughtful, always checking to make sure I was okay and understood what was happening. On a separate visit, I had to bring my toddler along during my visit, and the staff were so kind to her and even let her pick a toy from their toy drawer. Things like that go a long way for teaching children to not fear the dentist, and to even look forward to going. I can't recommend this office enough!< /review>

<Text>I have been a patient with Dr. smith for almost 3 years now. I have had a wonderful experience with the oral sedation process and he, and his staff, is fantastic. I would highly recommend Dr. Smith’s office to anyone that has anxiety about going to the dentist, or anyone that wants great care and service from a knowledgeable and friendly team.< /Text></record>

If you have a fear of the dentist, Dr. Smith is the one you want to see. About a year ago I had a cracked tooth and the pain was unbearable. I knew I had to go see a dentist but I was terrified. After doing some research I called Dr. Smith's office. His office staff is AMAZING. Melissa took her time with me and didn't make me feel like I was crazy for being so anxious and scared. I ended up having to have a root canal and I chose IV sedation. I showed up, went to sleep, and when I woke up the procedure was done and I do not remember any of it....just the way I wanted it to be! I have been back for cleanings and X-rays and Dr. Smith and his staff have all been amazing. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Smith to anyone who is fearful of going to the dentist.< /Text>

The best experience I have ever had at a dental office. I had so many fears about going to the dentist that it took everything I had to keep the appointment. And I only made the appointment because I was in so much pain. I chose this office because there was a page on their website that described exactly the fears I had about going to the dentist and how the staff there would be able to help. Melissa is amazing! From day one she put me at ease and helped me through a lot of dental work. I trust Dr. Smith fully. Trusting a dentist is not something that comes easy for me after many bad experiences, but Dr. Smith is different. He is very good at what he does, he is professional, and the work I have had done over the past few years is excellent. I can't imagine going anywhere else.</text>

<text>I have had a well deserved fear of dentists that kept me away from the dental chair for far too many years. I discovered Dr. Smith's  office and was suprised by the warm and welcoming staff. Melissa is amazing and was quick to put me at ease. Dr. Smith tells it like is but with warmth and kindness and no one there judges or shames you on your dental situation. I have and will continue to recommend Dr. Smith to anyone who has a fear of dentists and is looking for sedation dentistry. They are the best!< /text>< name>

<Review>I have not been to a dentist in years.  I have always had a fear of them.  But for some reason the minute I walked in to the office I was totally  calm and and peace.  The office is like no other, its cozy and welcoming and the staff is top notch.

Dr. Smith is so welcoming when he talks to you.  He explains everything about the process and what to expect.  Melissa his assistant is AMAZING.  She talks with you like she has know you for years and explains all the options available.  I have never felt more at home then I do at their office.  I would totally recommend them to anyone that needs a great dentist but is afraid to go go.  I have found my forever home.  Thank you Dr. Smith and your amazing Staff.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

We have been coming to Dr. Smith's office for almost 10 years now. I can honestly say I have been so pleased with my experience and with my kids' experiences. From the office staff to hygienist to Dr. Smith. My daughter had her wisdom teeth out at their office a year ago and Melissa made her feel so comfortable and explained the procedure in such away that we both felt completely at ease. Her experience with the sedation went so smooth. It is now time for my youngest son to have his wisdom teeth pulled and again Melissa walked us through the procedure and what he should expect. Dr. Smith came in and made certain we felt comfortable with everything. I highly recommend this office for any of your dental needs.<//Text>

<text>I have normally feared going to the dentist but from the initial consultation the staff and Dr. Smith were very straight forward and professional.
Dr. Smith and staff have provided a wonderful, caring, family oriented and pain free environment.  The office is modern and their equipment is impressive.  They understand my fears of pain.  They know what treatment needs to be done.  They have provided multiple procedure options and their cost estimates were in line with my end result.
Through my dental plan they have given me the comfort and safety of sedation.  I have achieved beautiful teeth and the process was pain free!  The results have been amazing and the follow-up with Dr. Smith and staff have been exemplary.
Now that I’ve found Dr. Smith I’ve found a dentist for life.  Not only for me but for my friends and family as well. He stands by his work and he stands by his patients.< /text>< resp>

<gmapID>0x80945d5a03d036b7:0xc536d3d31bbca71c</gmapID><Review>I called Dr. Smith's office after being told by Western Dental that my extreme tooth pain and very swollen jaw was due to a cracked tooth.  After failing to find even one good review about Western Dental I turned to Google to try and find a dentist.  That is when I came across Dr. Smith and all of the great reviews.  One tooth extraction, root canal and cavity later I can proudly write that the reviews are spot on.  From the moment I called his office I have received the best treatment.  Melissa got me in the office for x-rays and a consultation within 20 minutes of my initial call to their office!  Dr. Smith gave me his recommendations and once it was decided Melissa took over and thoroughly explained how it would all take place when I returned to get the work done.  I was sent home with two prescriptions for antibiotics and even 2 pills to take  while waiting for the pharmacy.  When I returned to get my work done, Dr. Smith did the sedation and dental work in about 2 hours.  Dr. Smith is great at inserting an IV; he is very precise and gentle.  Overall, he and his staff are great.  I highly recommend calling his office if you are looking for a great experience.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Melissa, Thank you so much for taking me under your wing and making me feel safe and at ease in the dental chair. I was very fearful of the dentist and I knew that IV sedation would be the only way to go. Melissa was amazing with explaining the whole process and putting me at ease. You truly have a gift for connecting and making your patients feel comfortable. I was terrified of the dentist before, however  because of your hospitality I'm looking forward to visiting the dentist again and one day having a smile as beautiful as yours. You have an amazing attitude and set a positive tone for the office. Dr. Smith is lucky to have such a passionate and genuine woman on his team.

I've been a patient of Dr. Smith for a few years so this review is well earned and past due. I have problems with dry mouth, jaw trauma and anxiety. Additionally, I experience elevated pain from fibromyalgia issues, so finding a sedation dentist was a necessity for me. Dr. Smith is able to complete my procedures without pain, making it possible for me to have the dental work I need. He has provided me with attractive, functional teeth thru a treatment plan of fillings, root canals, crowns and soon a dental implant. Because of Dr. Smith and his wonderful staff, I finally have teeth without pain or problems. His skill and compassion for patients sets him apart from other providers. I highly recommend Dr. Smith for all your dental needs, especially if you have special issues or experience anxiety. The staff at Rob Smith dentistry can make it possible to get the dental work you need but never thought you could have.< /Review>

<review>I've always had anxiety about going to the dentist, which became worse as I developed a locking-jaw issue, leaving me unable to sit through appointments. Dr. Smith and his team have changed dentistry for me. Firstly, they have a beautiful and comfortable office with friendly  reception staff. Melissa is so kind and thoughtful as she gives exams, takes x-rays, and explains procedures. She takes the time to make me feel valued and addresses all my concerns. She makes sure you are comfortable and accommodates any anxiety/health issues you have. Dr. Smith is compassionate and also direct, making sure you understand procedures. I need sedation to complete any dental work, and they made me feel confident in their medical knowledge and professionalism. This was my first sedation experience, and it was great. The day of my procedure, even before sedation, the staff made sure I was comfortable, Dr. Smith checked in with me, and they confirmed they would call the person who was coming to pick me up. When I woke up, they checked with me again and made sure I felt okay before I left. This is the best dentist experience I have ever had, and I can't recommend Dr. Smith and his staff enough. If you are looking for sedation dentistry and/or just a wonderful dentist, visit this office.<//review>< pictures>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Melissa and Dr. Smith were great. I chose this place specifically for the IV sedation because I need an extraction and a filling. I have severe anxiety and fear when it comes to the dentist. This was only a consultation but it was the best first visit I've ever had at a dentist office. They're very reassuring and gentle with their patients. I haven't had my procedure yet but I will update my review when I do. Thank you Melissa and Dr. Smith.

UPDATE

The procedure went well. I didn't feel any pain and best of all I don't remember a thing! As long as you listen to their instructions to a T everything will go smoothly. This place is truly one of a kind. I just had my extraction and filling yesterday and I've already made my next appointment!</review><Rating>5</Rating><username>Zohra Fazil< /username></record>

I had put off getting a bunch of work done to my mouth for fifteen years after bad experiences from chain dentists. I'm so glad I listened to the reviews for Smith Sedation Dentistry. The professionals and office staff have made the last year a breeze despite a jam-packed treatment plan. If it weren't for them I'd still be having nightmares of my teeth crumbling out of my mouth! Thank you for the work you do.</review>

Just went today for a quick appointment. They're so busy that I had to ask how long is the wait because I need to go to work soon. And then the lady said they will call me in a minute. After that it was blazing fast! In just 20 minutes they x-ray/prescribed and refill one of my teeth and had no problems with it. All the staff were saying "sorry about the wait" and I said 'no problem' for 5 times!. Amazing staff, amazing experience and amazing doctor!</review>

Just had all four of my wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Smith, my gums are healing so fast and I was comfortable through the whole procedure. I have an extreme phobia of needles and he made sure I didn't see them prior to the sedation. I was out before I even realized they had put an IV in my arm. His staff is wonderful and friendly and he is such a thorough and professional dentist who truly cares for his patients. He was even willing to stay late on a Friday to see me. I highly recommend Dr. Smith, he is seriously the best dentist I've ever had!</review>

On 7/31/2017 I had my first visit at DR Rob Smith's office. The minute
I walked in the staff was very friendly as they greeted me, and made
me feel comfortable right off the bat. I have extreme Anxiety when it
comes to Dental care, I found this Dentist on-line, and felt it was
a good place to make my new dentist since I just moved here from WA.
Then I met Melisa Dow. She is such an asset to this dentist office.
She was very caring and compassionate towards my needs. She took
the time to answer all my questions and addressed my concerns. I then met DR Rob Smith. He also was very Kind and I liked how he spoke to
me and treated me while at his office. I would Highly recommend
DR Smith's office for all your Dental needs. They're all very kind, friendly,
and show compassion the minute you walk in or call.

I would highly recommend Dr. Smith to anyone considering a new dentist. I've been going there for over 15 years and I've always been pleased with the experience. He is a very good dentist, knowledgeable, and takes his time to talk to you about what is going on and different options to take. His staff is full of nice, friendly, personable people who make coming there smooth, and easy. I was apprehensive about having all four of my wisdom teeth extracted and after procrastinating so long, I decided to give them a call and the overall experience was far easier than I anticipated.< /Text>

<Review>On a scale of 1 to 10, my dental anxiety is a 15.  It took me days to gather the courage to pick up the phone and call Dr. Smith's office.  I am so thankful that I did.  From the moment I walked in everyone was kind and reassuring.  I left my consultation appointment feeling relieved that we had a plan to tackle my dental needs and relieved that no one judged me, despite my overwhelming anxiety that was present throughout the appointment.  My first sedation appointment went wonderfully and I don't remember a thing! I had no negative reactions to any of the medications, which was another fear of mine and both Dr. Smith and Melissa called me after my procedure to make sure all was well.  I am so thankful that I found Dr. Smith, and I truly feel like his entire office cares so much for his patients.  If you are reading these reviews, scared to pick up that phone and call, just do it! I know you won't regret it....  Dr. Smith's office is the place to go!< /Review>< rating>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I have had dental anxiety since I was a small child. Having traumatic experiences with several dentists created a fear of the word "dentist" early on.  As an educated adult, I thought, "this can't be my life", a fear of a  professional.  My experience has been eye opening and a blessing. Dr. Smith introduced himself to me and made me feel very comfortable. His staff understood my fear and made every accommodation to fit my needs.  I had several procedures done with sedation and I felt amazing, NO PAIN.  If this sounds like yourself, please visit Dr. Smith's office, you will not be afraid any longer.  I look forward to my visits.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Are you one of those people who absolutely dreads having dental work done?  I certainly was, that is, until I discovered Dr. Smith.  After having a consultation, I decided to give him a try.  I'm so glad that I did.  It was the best decision I ever made.  Dr. Smith's bedside manner was wonderful, and his knowledgeable,  friendly, highly competent staff make going to the dentist much more pleasant.

As a young girl and teenager I was taken to the dentist every 6 months.  At least 6-8 cavities each time!  I still can hear the drill!! As an adult, the thought of going to the dentist made me ill.  My husband and I heard about Dr. Smith and decided we would TRY him.  Oh my!  He and his entire staff are completely professional, patient and caring!  We have complete confidence in him and his staff!  I no longer fear/dread going to the dentist.  Thank you, Dr. Smith and your amazing staff!!!  Nancy Moeck</review>

I recently had my 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Rob Smith and his dental staff. The experience was a breeze! I felt nothing during the procedure and woke up to no pain of any kind. The following day, which is regarded by some to be the worst, brought minimal to no pain, and they were extremely good about maintaining contact with me throughout the entire experience. my recovery was fast and easy with no complications, as a result of me following simple outlined instructions that they provided. If they preform other extractions half as good as mine was, I would still highly recommend this staff to anyone without a second of hesitation.< /review>

< Review>
Prior to becoming a patient of Dr. Smith, I was terrified of going to the dentist!  I had avoided it for years and, when an issue developed that I could no longer ignore, a good friend recommended Dr. Rob.  She had warned the doctor & his staff that I would be contacting them to make an appointment and that I was a big chicken!  From my first visit, each and every member of the staff greeted me with kindness and understanding.  Dr. Smith greeted me personally, we discussed my issues (both my teeth & my fear of dealing with my teeth!) and he put on his "kid gloves" and slowly guided me through the examination.  When I found out we would need to pull 7 teeth- my anxiety kicked into overdrive!  Dr. Smith explained the procedure and all aspects of it thoroughly and we decided that sedation was the only way this was going to happen for me.  Dr. Smith performed his magic while I was sedated and it couldn't have gone any better! I would have NEVER had 7 teeth extracted if I didn't have the option of being sedated.  Both the procedure and the recovery went beautifully!  It has been almost a year since the surgery, two sessions of deep cleanings, and last week I had my first preventative cleaning visit.  I am proud to say that, for the first time as an adult, I didn't shed a tear at my dental visit!  Thank you Dr. Smith and thanks to your entire staff for making a mole hill out of a mountain!< /Review>

my experience with sedation to get my wisdom teeth removed and other extra dental work done was very hassle free and went well! i admit that in the beginning i was very nervous to be put under, but the procedure went well and there was absolutely no complications! the staff there made me feel very calm and i trusted them completely!!<//text>

My first appointment was with Melissa.  She took my X-rays and then explained everything they needed to do, in detail, until I was completely comfortable.  She scheduled my first appointment and then introduced me to Dr. Smith.  The energy in the office is positive and the people are warm and welcoming.  I am so happy with the work they did and even more excited to be able to smile without feeling self conscious!!  I have already scheduled my next appointment with Dr. Smith, and plan to schedule all my family with him as well!  Melissa is a wonderful asset to his practice and I am very grateful our paths crossed!<//review>

I had avoided the dentist for 30 years because of my intest gag reflex and anxiety about the dentist, but since I've started seeing Dr Smith ive been able to salvage my dental health through sedation and the staffs accommodation.

The very first vist.Dr Smith and the staff made me feel comfortable and confident that I had come to a careing pain free dentist.
I had needed dental work for a long time but was too scared because of a bad experience by another dentist.
My experience was amazing. I'm not afraid any more and i can smile again with all my theeth fixed.< /review>

My parents drove me an hour and a half, every month, for three months while I was getting my implants.  I had a small time frame to get them done before I went into the Army.  Dr. Smith had earned their trust from the previous work he did on my sister, and he delivered again!  I now know why they insisted Dr. Smith do my implants.  The whole process went great.  He explained the whole procedure to me, and what I could expect.  I had very little pain, I was well taken care of, and best of all my smile looks GREAT!< /Text>

I cannot say enough about Dr. Smith & his staff! I neglected going to ANY dentist for years due to the horrible experiences I've had in the past.Needless to say that due to those experiences I was a total wreck on my first visit but was quickly put at ease by the AMAZING staff & Dr. Smith. my nerves & anxiety subsided & I was overwhelmed by how gentle, comforting & informative they were with me. Of course I chose sedation for my procedures. I was taken back by how well the dental hygienist  were making sure i was doing well & made sure there were no bad reactions to sedation. NEVER have I ever had such a great experience in Any dental office like this before. Dr. Smith himself called me the next day after my first procedure to make sure I was doing well. WOW! I knew at that moment I had found my life-long dentist. He & his staff are a God send!!!!! I recommend him to anyone that is looking for a new dentist & have started taking my teenagers there. I strongly suggest Dr. Smith's office if you need work done, need a new dentist or are looking to change your current dentist. You WILL NOT be disappointed!<//Text>

My past experience at the dentist was anxiety and dripping sweat during my appointments. Now ,with the ease of sedation dentistry during my procedures, my comfort level has dramatically improved. I'm able to withstand multiple procedures in a single visit, thus reducing as many visits to the office. The kindness and professionalism of all the staff explains the ease of how the sedation will take place, and what to expect. This again adds to the ease of the benefits of sedation dentistry. For me this new horizon of care, is the solution to help ease years past bad experiences in the dentist chair. My choice and recommendation for anyone with dental fears, is to put yourself into the very capable hands of Dr. Rob Smith DDS and his excellent staff. I would never have dental work done any other way in the future< /Review>

<Review>I came to this office because I had gone through a round of horrible dentistry work elsewhere and needed better work. Rob Smith and his staff are hands down the best dentistry I've ever had. Not only was he able to relive me of the pain I had from two horribly done root canals, he was able to give me piece of mind and ease throughout my whole procedure. My teeth had to be pulled and I was sedated, something I was very nervous about. The staff here not only went above and beyond to make sure I was at ease, they made sure I had all my medication prior and talked me through all my questions and concerns. The sedation process was the easiest I've ever had, It felt like I was awake for less than a few minutes and before I knew it everything was done and over. I felt nothing after and was able to relax. The Dentist even called me later that day to make sure I was okay. This is honestly the best office you can come to for any dentistry work. I came here because I needed relief and the sense of safety after going through bad work somewhere else and I'm so happy I found this office.<//Review>< name>

One word that will describe Dr. Smith's office staff and himself, Love. From the first phone call you make to the end of our visit, you will love the experience. They treat you so well and make sure that you understand every step of the process. I am so glad that I chose to come here for my treatment and you will be too.<//Text>

Highly recommended.  I had not been to a dentist in over 16 years and my experience at this office was amazing.  Not only were the staff extremely friendly, but their patient care was top notch.  I have been to several appointments over the last year and feel comfortable knowing they have my best interest and care at heart.  They are now helping me with potential sleep issues as well as my on-going dental work.  I've referred my dad knowing that Dr. Smith will take exceptional care of him as well.  Again, highly recommended.<//review>

I am 52 and a HORRIBLE patient. I bawl every time I have to go. I have had an extreme fear of Dentist all my life. I have a couple infected teeth. They got me right in that same day. They make you feel like part of the family. I have observed ALL of the staff treating people like they matter. I have never heard any one moan, let alone scream (as I did with the last dentist office I walked into) I have further appointments because I trust in what they are going to do AND how their going to do it. Will I still need to be carried thru the door? YES. Will I still bawl like a baby? YES. But I have full confidence that they are going to take care of me in a positive manner. Their Awesome!</review>

I don't know why I was deathly afraid of the dentist, but I avoid them at all cost! I had successfully avoided the dentist for 10 years! I met Melissa, who works for Dr. Smith, at a private function. She was explaining her job, it brought tears to my eyes and I had to leave the conversation. Even hearing about the dentist scared me!! She sought me out and encouraged me to try the sedation or at least come hear about it. At that time I had several teeth hurting and felt that they would hurt me the rest of my life! (As I was NOT going to a dentist) I have driven to dentist offices before only to not go through the front door and get in my car and leave. I sweat, I cringe, cry and I cannot stand to hear any noise that a dentist makes. I thought I would give sedation a try after several weeks of contemplation (or months) or at least go hear about it. When I made my appointment, the staff knew I was hesitant. I was treated so kindly and quickly was shown to a private room to meet with Dr. Smith. At that time, I got to look at and touch every instrument that he was going to use. The sedation process was explained to me thoroughly and my appointment was set. The day of the sedation, I have to tell you I remember walking in and then an office staff person buckling my seat belt when I was leaving. I don't remember a thing, but my teeth look SO BEAUTIFUL! I have never seen them look this good. This made me proud and I really want to continue taking care of my teeth! I have even talked to the staff about using the gas only next time. Dr. Smith's office places you at top priority, they are there to meet your comfort level. I loved my experience and will go back!<//Text>

I am writing on behalf of myself as well as my husband Camilo Reyes.  He recently went thru having implants done and used Dr. Smith.  He never liked going to the dentist but after using Dr. Smtih and the sedation method, it made him so comfortable and able to get all the work he needed done and it was a great experience  This is what has helped me in deciding to also go with oral sedation to have the work done on myself as well.  After talking with Camilo and his experience, it helped tremendouslyand I know my own experience will also be positive.  Thank you Dr. Smth and ALL the staff.  They are great.<//Review>

I have had some of the most horrifying and embarrassing experiences at other dentist offices. I have needed extensive dental work done for a number of years, but due to my previous experiences, I refused to go anywhere. I was referred to Dr. Smith by my employer and decided to try this dentist because of the amount of unbearable pain I was in.
When I went in to see Dr. Smith, everyone was exceptionally kind to me. Dr. Smith was thorough and to the point without making me feel ashamed or embarrassed of my teeth. I have never felt so comfortable and confident with a dentist as I do with Dr. Smith and his team. I am so thankful for all of their kindness and compassion that they have shown me. My family and I will be coming here for any dental procedures we need done in the future. There is no dentist that I trust more than Dr. Smith.
To Dr. Smith and all of his staff, my wife and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for everything.<//review>

<Text>Due to previous experiences with other dentists and oral surgeon, I have become fearful of going to the dentist.  I researched sedation dentistry and found Dr. Smith.  From the initial consultation, through surgery, and follow-up, Dr. Smith and his staff's priority was to make me feel comfortable.  They explained everything about the process and addressed all of my concerns.  For three days following my surgery, Dr. Smith called me at home daily to check on my progress.  Melissa and the staff are awesome; they are so friendly and compassionate.  I wish I found Dr. Smith sooner.  I will recommend him to family and friends.< /Text>< user>

I never been to a Sedation Dentist and after a little research and I decided to go to Dr. Smith. And to be honest I am very scared of going to the dentist and don't like the pain after procedures. They took very care of me as soon as I came in, made me feel comfortable, as they were understanding about how nervous I was and the whole appointment was very pleasant and I loved how they checked up on me to see how I was doing. I RECOMMEND THIS DENTIST!

If you are scared or nervous about visiting the Dentist this one will help you though the process.

< Review>
After losing my income and insurance after a hit and run, I was left dealing with medi-cal dentists who don't care about anyone at all. I was treated like a number and bounced around like a basketball. I couldn't handle it, so I came to Dr Smith because I used to come to him when I was still working, and I know that he and his staff can't be beat.

When you come through the door you'll  instantly realize they treat you like family. Unlike every other dentist I've been to, Dr.Smith makes sure I always understand what's going on 100% with my treatment and his amazing staff always do their best to make me feel safe and comfortable. It's really an amazing environment. And I am not just someone who came in for a cleaning. I am having good deal of work done, and if it was anywhere else, I'd be anxious and worried. But since it's Dr.Smith, I'm really looking forward to my new teeth and my new quality of life!

P.S.
Melissa is AMAZING!!! She treated me like I was her own brother, and she saved me from a situation that I was afraid I'd never escape. I can't express enough what a great person she is, and I'm so glad she's a part of Dr.Smith's staff.

P.P.S.S.
Don't hesitate to come to Dr.Smith if you have a fear of the dentist. He and his staff WILL put you at ease. It's like a miracle center in my eyes.

UPDATE: It's been 5 days since my procedure, and while there's still a good bit if healing and learning to do, I am so impressed with what Dr.Smith and his and his team has done for me. My teeth have never looked so good.< /Review>

As a highly anxious person, the dentist is the last place I want to be. Clearly this aversion to dental work wasn't going to last forever. I came in for a consult with Melissa and she went above and beyond the call of duty in making me comfortable and feeling validated in both my fears and my anxiety. Going in for the work today, but as of yet, this has already been the most comfortable and easy going dental experiences I've ever gone through.</Review>

Dr. Smith's kind, gentle way creates a calm atmosphere, but the procedure of having twenty veneers "installed" took some time.  The option of sedation during the process was very appealing to Tony as well as me.  It removed any anxiety and made our dental experiences pleasant.</Review>

I am the type of person that is thrown into fits of anxiety when I even think about the dentist. I didn't realize how affordable it could be to undergo sedation when getting dental work done. They were extremely sensitive to my fears and I experienced a painless removal of two bad teeth, with very little recovery time needed.  I tell everyone I know about the wonders of dentistry I experienced at the office of Dr. Smith.  If you know him, there's no fear when it comes to your teeth.<//text></record>

<review>I always get super anxious right before any dental procedure.  Dr. Rob and his staff calmed every anxiety I had, they listened, calmed my nerves and got me through each procedure!  I cannot thank them enough!  They went above and beyond.  They were honest with their billing, and after my third opinion, I can honestly say that.  Plus, it's a bonus his staff is always a pleasure to talk to.  They all seem to love working there-that says a lot about an establishment!</review>< date>

They were always sweet and helpful anytime I had questions. My first appointment was 4 hours and I didn't feel a thing. I would recommend this office to anybody, especially those with dental work anxiety!<//text>< Rating>

Last week I felt my wisdom teeth coming in. I do not go to the dentist regularly however, I was in terrible pain. The day I called, I was able to get an appointment. No only did I get an appointment promptly, they scheduled my surgery to remove my wisdom teeth that same week! I was very satisfied with the urgency and availability to get me in ASAP. With that, I had the pleasure of meeting Melissa. Melissa is such a gem. She is so personable and really made my experience that much better. I was very nervous the day of my procedure and she was there to talk me through it. I even called to thank her the next week because she was that memerable. This office has so much going for them, I recommend them at every level! Xoxo<//text>

<text>I absolutely couldn't stand going to the dentist before going here! Their sedation dentistry takes all the worry and anxiety out of going and getting work done! The office is nice and clean, and the staff friendly. If you're looking for a good dentist around here that offers Sedation, this is the place to go.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I have been avoiding going to the dentist for years due to my fear of dentistry. My wife finally convinced me to try Dr. Smith and it was the best decision ever! Dr. Smith and his faculty made me feel at ease and were very kind. You could tell that they actually care about you and your needs unlike most dentists who just look at you like a paycheck. I had to have 4 teeth pulled so they used sedation and I didn't even know they opened my mouth let alone pulled 4 teeth. Best experience at a dentist ever! I am now a lifetime patient of Dr. Smith. I am so thankful!< /text>

<time>1394660262673<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I have hated the dentist since I was a child. A few years back I started having panic attacks and having to take medication just to sit in the waiting room at the dentist office. I could not do this anymore. I needed to get my teeth looked at and it had been three years since I last visit a dentist. I decided to google sedation dentists. A few popped up but once I saw the website for Doctor Rob Smith I knew this was the perfect place for me. My instincts were confirmed with in moments of my first visit a year ago. I walked in with a scared look on my face and the dental hygienists were instantly comforting and welcoming. It was OK that I was terrified . I was not alone here. During my x-rays they let me take a break if I needed to and during the sedation process they walked me through each step as they were doing it, what it would feel like, and that I was going to be alright. They called me a day later to make sure that I was recovering well and to let me ask any question I was too groggy to ask the day before. Dr. Rob Smith and his fabulous team truly care about you as a person and a patient. They want  you to feel comfortable, safe, and at home with them. I go to my appointments in my pajamas, with my favorite blanket in tow! While the fear of the dentist still lingers it is nothing like it once was. I strongly encourage anyone who struggles with going to the dentist to give Dr, Smith a call. You will wish you had called years ago!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80945d5a03d036b7:0xc536d3d31bbca71c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was so happy to try the sedation option, I am a white knuckle patient & always filled with anxiety. Dr. Smith & all his awesome team are always so kind & professional. But, I'm a big baby!
The sedation experience was great, no pain, did not remember the procedure & felt fine after I was driven home, no residual effects! This is the only way for this gal to go!

Thank you for making dental appointments a pleasure now!

He and his staff are warm and welcoming, I've had a few dental emergencies and Dr.Smith took the time out of his vacation to help me, (he actually called within the same hour I called his emergency line) I have,"dental anxiety" and his office is the only one I've found that understands and truly helps to accommodate patients like mysellf.<//Review>

<Review>After MANY difficult, anxious and painful experiences going to the dentist, I thought I was doomed to continue that same pattern.  Then I discovered Dr Smith.  What a relief!  I can't tell you how helpful and understanding they all are.  I would encourage anyone with a lot of work to be done, or anyone who suffers from fear and anxiety about dental work to go see Dr. Smith and his staff!

<review>4 months ago I made Dr. Smith cry as he looked at my neglected teeth. 4 teeth have to go, he said. As I was sedated, at no time did I feel pain. When it comes to the dentist I am a frightened little girl, but I felt extremely comfortable. My 4 boys, husband and I will all be going to Dr. Smith.  Thanks a million.<//review>< username>

For me, it was so bad that I nearly had a panic attack just going in for a consultation. But the staff there answered all my questions and never once made me feel bad about my fears or about the poor condition of my teeth. I had two sessions under sedation, both of which went very smoothly. I have no memories of either procedure and felt completely relaxed after each one. I've already recommended Dr Smith to family and friends who are afraid of going to the dentist.< /review>< Resp>

<rating>1< /rating><review>I’ve seen this dentist twice. The first time he looked at my mouth and X-rays and left the room. He came back in like five minutes later and said I have no idea what’s wrong with your teeth or why your in so much pain. I went back some time later as the pain was worse. He did not even look at me directly let alone an exam in my mouth. He said to me and my husband well we can pull the back top and SEE if that helps. Mind you while never even turning his head away from a monitor to speak to me. I left again receiving no help or even an actual exam, however he charged my insurance company saying he preformed an exam. So thief in my mind. I went to another sedation dentist who was more personable and took the time to listen. He too said that he could not see a reason for the pain but had experienced this before and suggested I had a facial neuropathy which was sending the pain into my mouth. This made total sense as it runs in my family and I have other issue with it. If you want a good decent dentist I suggest Curt Posey DDS in Fresno on Maple of of Herron. He was kind, caring and everything this dentist was not!!!!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Coming to Dr. Smith, I was in the TOP 5 of dental anxiety patients. I even gave him my reasons -- mostly stemming from my negative childhood dental experiences. The entire office was very comforting and professional. After just 1 visit I would strongly recommend IV/sedation dentistry and/or Dr. Smith for anybody with or without dental anxiety. My wife will be coming next and will hope that my son and daughter follow my lead in creating a better, more positive dental future. I ask that you, the reader, try Dr. Smith and staff at least once. THANK YOU Dr. Rob and dental family, for helping me with MY future !!</review>

I was so comfortable I opted to skip the sedation and have had great experiences ever since! I was so concerned about the pain, the condition of my teeth and the financial burden, and all of those issues have been resolved with Dr. Smith! His rates are much lower than my past experiences!

Since the 9th grade I have disliked the dentist. I had a bad and traumatic experience since then I have been phobic and refuse to go see any dentist. Until I went to see Dr. Smith, he made going to the dentist a great experience. The very first time I went to see Dr. Smith not only did he come out to the waiting area to introduce himself to me he also made me feel completely at ease. I can not praise Dr. Smith enough along with his caring staff for making me feel comfortable each and every time I have gone. I have had issues with my teeth a few times over the weekend and I have been able to call Dr. Smith and speak to him directly. Dr. Smith has went above and beyond with me. I would recommend Dr. Smith to anyone young or old.< /Text>

I feared going to the dentist i put it off for way way to long! Until i could no more. I worried n fretted every time i thought of what dentist to choose to me every dentist was going to be bad the thought of drilling, gaging, having my mouth as wide open as possible it was going to hurt no way out! Having someone that close staring down at me in my space, i couldn't i just couldn't i did not want to!!!!
I asked a co worker if she knew of a dentist a good dentist. She quickly responded Dr Smith and after his name "love, love love him"  ok this sounded promising. I scheduled, i was so nervous n scared.
When i sat in the chair water works started, i couldn't stop feeling emotional. Melissa was so kind gentle and patient, she took her time explaining and assuring me.
She knew when to talk and when to pull back she took her time which put me at ease. Then i met Dr Smith, what a gentle soul he had. I couldn't believe when he asked me "You hate me?" Says he is told that alot by patients! No of course i didn't hate him.
His personality was very kind and gentle, very pleasant and genuine.

I had four hours of dental work under sedation! I dont remember a thing. The doctor called me hours after the surgery to see how i was doing and gave me his cell so i could call him if i had any problems.
I am amazed with the experience Dr Smith and his staff gave me. They are fantastic because of them i will never be afraid to go to the dentist again. I wouldn't want to see anyone but him!
Thank you Dr Smith you are an awsome dentist and you have an awesome staff. I am truly grateful to you all!

I can truly say i love my dentist!<//review>

<Review>If you're like me and hate going to the dentist then you need to visit Dr Rob Smith and his staff. For me its always a list full of problems at the dentist, and of course nerves kick in about the actual surgery. I went to Dr. Rob Smith and walked away excited about my surgery. Hes very honest and nice. I had the sedation and only remember falling asleep and waking up and left there laughing and all dental needs complete. I had a super fast recovery with no pain and no swelling! Thank you Dr Rob Smith!!< /Review>< Name>

This is the only dentist I will go to. Going to the dentist used to scare me to death but after my experience with Dr. Smith and Melissa I look forward to my next appointment. I had totally given up on my smile but it was given new life after a visit to them. Sedation was something I had considered for awhile but was apprehensive about, not the case here. I didn't even feel much pain after having  4 teeth extracted! This doctor is flawless, and his staff is amazing! They gave me a bright new smile just in time for the holidays and I cannot thank them enough!!!</Review>

I was referred to Dr.Smith by my son who lives in fresno,and i live in bakersfield,ca.Through out my life,I have had bad experiences with dentists.I was fearful and dreaded going to see any dentists. After meeting Dr. Smith and his staff, my fears were in the past. His staff is impeccable,so kind and courteous,and gives the patient their full attention. Dr Smith is amazing he explained my entire procedure and asked for my opinion.His full consideration was about me,the patient. I will refer everyone i know to Dr Smith, he is a true professional and knows his craft. He is AMAZING!!!!<//review>

<review>I am fairly new to the Fresno area and needed an oral surgeon ASAP for a root canal, cracked tooth due to stress, and crown. As I have had an entire lifetime of oral issues (with four front teeth being knocked out at age 15, I have had a bridge ever since) and had my first panic attack in the dentist chair, I've always been hesitant and always needed to be sedated, even with my bi-yearly cleanings.  By coincidence, I met Dr. Smith via word-of-mouth and felt very comfortable with him and his staff from my first consultation and throughout the entire process of the root canal and crown.  He and his office staff were very sensitive to my anxiety needs, pain control, and, his overall expertise was very impressive.  In fact, on my last visit with him, I didn't even require any type of anxiety med; that being a first in 28 years, so I was very proud of myself.  I would highly recommend Dr. Smith to ANY potential patient out there - he did an awesome job, and he even called in the evening to check up on me the day of my root canal.  He (and staff) get a 10/10 from me! Barb L.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I came across Dr Smith, the reviews looked good and I made an appt.  Now 3 weeks later I am post surgery and am so happy with the experience.  I was given a happy pill to take at home and don't even remember the surgery itself. It was easy and pain free.  The office is very nice, calming and the staff is sweet, friendly and professional.  I will definitely be going back to complete more work in the future.  Thank you Dr Smith and Staff, Elizabeth Newberry-Smith< /review>< Pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I have a 24yr old daughter, Kaydie with Down Syndrome. Her dental health is always a concern for me since she will not open her mouth for any dental work. I searched for a dentist and knew I was going to need sedation for her. She would not cooperate just because she does not understand. I was so lucky to come across Dr. Smith and Melissa. They both talked to me about my concerns for Kaydie and explained everything that would happen and what to expect. Kaydie also has a heart condition so they took all the necessary precautions. Dr. Smith was able to complete the dental work on Kaydie in a quick, swift and compassionate matter. My husband thinks he is Batman.
As a parent of a special needs young adult I highly recommend Dr. Smith and his staff. They are highly trained and wonderful people. Did I mention we travel 2 hours to see Dr. Smith.
I am so grateful for Dr. Smith.</Review>< Pics>

Dear Dr. Smith and Staff,

The words I cannot begin to describe in full how I feel about Dr. Smith, his staff and office. They are so totally awesome, kind, patient, helpful and understanding and that is only a little part of what I have to say.

I called at the very last minute to get an apt. scheduled before the year was up so I could maximize all my benefits. They came in on their day off to take care of me and several others that were in the same situation.

First you have to understand I am deathly afraid of going to a dentist office.  Second I have Fibromyalgia with chronic fatigue and I am in pain all the time. Third I have a hard time getting numb and I am not easily sedated.

With all of this going on I have had to walk a very long road in trying to get help, being passed up & spit out like I did not exist. I have spent the last year eating only soft foods because of the work done on me at my last two dental appointments. Needless to say it has not been a easy road.

I was VERY VERY worried that I was going to go thru the same thing as before (pain, not being sedated right & coming out with a worse problem then I went in for) but that was not the case. Not only did they fit me in, they spoke with me about the work that needed to be done, they showed me the X-Rays and explained the problem areas I had.

On the day of my procedure I do not remember anything from the time they started my IV until 5 PM that evening. I did not wake up or either do not remember waking up if I did during the procedure. I was so relaxed I slept like a baby and anyone who knows anything about Fibromyalgia knows we do not sleep, we are in pain 24/7, we are tense and fatigued and things do not work on us like they do on the average person and last we do not sedate easily.

Dr. Smith has been the only dentist that has ever been able to sedate me the way he did and for that I am very thankful for. He called my house that same evening after the procedure to check how I was doing.

I have finally found a Dentist who understands what I go thru and who can deal with my difficulties. His work is superb, even thou I still have a lot more work that needs to be done I have my smile back and I am starting to eat real food again because of him and for that I am so very thankful.

On another note behind every good Doctor there is a great team of people working with him. I was surrounded by his staff as if I was the only person in the room, they were all making me feel comfortable while doing their job.

There is one particular person her name is Melissa, she is the one who took my X-Rays and initial report on me and she did an absolutely fantastic job in making me comfortable and totally understood when I could not hold the object in my mouth she found another alternative to help me finish the X-Rays. She also allowed me to talk about my previous events that I had dealt with. I felt like finally someone is actually listening to what I was saying and they cared about trying to do what they could to help me. Afterwards she went and told the Doctor about me and the work I needed and my financial problems. The Doctor then came in and spoke with me about everything. All I can say is I felt like I was at home surrounded by family and that I have never felt before at any dental office I have visited in my life time.

There is not one complaint that I can make. I only wish I would of found them sooner.

Thank you so much

Sincerely

Sandra Self<//Review>

I had only went two times as a child.  As an adult the fear grew.  I have been seeing Dr. Smith and his staff for many years now.  I have several of my friends that I recommended and now go to his office.

I can't say enough positive about Dr. Smith's kindness, gentle approach and always reassuring nature.  Also, I have to mention Melssa, she is so calming and caring, from the start to the end.  She is perfect for her job and I truly appreciate her.

Got one of my teach removed with anastestia (sp) at 3 today.  I'm home and feeling so mutch better.  typing is not so clear, though :LOL.

The girls are the front great too.  They make sure all of your paperwork and insurance goes smoothy

My Chart name is Terri Gresham I was seen twice today on Sept 9-8-15.

<Review>Ok First things first. There are 3 things im DEATHLY afraid of in life. Number 1. Dentist 2. Spiders and 3. Ill find out later. As i was saying ive had ALOT of bad experiences with other dentist and i have anxiety attacks and a overwhelming fear of being prodded with sharp needles and the sound of drills is excruciating! Thus i havent been to or seen a dentist in maybe 10 years? One day my back molar was killing me and i believe i had a infection and couldnt take the pain NO LONGER. I asked a friend if she knew any good dentist and she referred me to Dr Rob Smith. So i made an appointment and they saw me the same day. Needless to say i was in so much fear but the doctor and the staff were VERY VERY VERY KIND and Understanding. They told me what needed to be done and gave me this weird little blue pill that calms you down and makes you loopy ha ha. Then they gave me gas and pulled by tooth and before i knew it i was out of there and at home pain free. I was SO HAPPY that things went way beyond my expectations. Yesterday i also went back because i had plaque build up and it was bothersome and AGAIN they did what they do best and assured me that i will be taken care of. One of the prettiest assistant i ever seen cleaned my teeth and when i felt any kind of pain she stopped immediately. She was very understanding i knew my tolerance for pain and did such a wonderful job comforting me and calming me down. Im sorry i forgot your name assistant but i was loopy off that pill :) . Anyways she was a sweetheart and mellissa is down to earth and is very helpful. Dr Smith is AWESOME and thanks to him i am and will eventually get my teeth all fixed up. Its just gonna take baby steps and they work with your budget too! Dr Smith and the Staff are here to help not to hurt and i love them! Thank God for FINALLY finding a Good Dentist and a Dentistry Staff! Love you guys and yes i will be back for another visit! HIGHLY RECOMMEND and this is coming from a guy whos number one fear is the dentist so you know they are the BEST OF THE BEST if its coming from me :)<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I was referred to Dr. Smiths office by a friend.  I had not been to the dentist in 4 years and to be honest was afraid & emberessed.  The first vist I was faced with a lot due to the lacking of my teeth, I had a lot going on in my mouth that I had ingnored that scared me more but I felt already that I was in good hands.  Dr. Smith is AWESOME , not on is he but his staff I didnt feel in the least bit that it was my 1st visit just felt like i had returned.  I was scheduled for an oral surgery the end of that week and I wasnt scared, or anxious. I trusted I was in good hands..   They have been so sweet , so glad to have found him.  I promise you won't be dissapointed!< /Review>

I am terrified of the dentist and have anxiety attacks over even taking xray. The xray tech talked me through the anxiety attack and we able to get it done.  Dr. Smith set up a plan of action and did all my dental work in 1 day.  Melissa his assistant met with me to go over everything with me and even set me up with a sleep diagnostic study.  Come to find out i have sleep apena.  On the day of the dental work the staff made me feel so at ease and next thing I know I wake up and everything was done.  I dont remember anything.   Dr. Smith called me the next day to see how I was doing. It was even on the 4th of July weekend. Since then they have called to check up on me twice.  If you are looking for a Dentist and staff who truly cares for their patients then you need to go see Dr. Smith.<//Text>< user_id>

Extremely happy with my experience. I have a very deep fear of the dentist that makes me wait until I’m in pain to be seen and even then I’m crying and shaking. Dr. Smith and his staff were all extremely caring and understanding of the things that make me anxious. My biggest worries were addressed and understood and I got all my work done while I slept through the whole thing. Everyone has been really great at checking in on me after and seeing how my healing has progressed. I still have more dental issues to address and I’m going to keep coming to see Dr. Smith!</review>

Expensive because of the freeway location. But it's a decent snack shack and they sell bagged ice.</Text>

LOCK YOUR CAR.
Remove your phone.
Keep your windows up.

Are you paying at the pump? Good. Lock your car. Don’t leave your car unattended even while locked.

Don’t leave anything in your car.

I know it’s a little over the top but I’ve witnessed first hand things you don’t ever want to see.

They have an excellent car was and gas right off the bridge.</review>

<Date>1576911869746</Date><Review>This is the worst quality gas station I've found, hands down. Most of the pumps were broken. One of the pumps had a sign to see the attendant - who just directed us to try a different pump. For those that appeared functional they had many of the features disabled (such as the RFID reader for chips). The attendant on duty was unintelligible most of the time, and yelled at my friend when she just wanted to pay for gas on one of the pumps that wouldn't take the RFID.

I suggest finding any other gas station if possible. Heck, running out of gas in the middle of the Bay Bridge would be a better experience than visiting this place.< /Review></record>

Really convenient location right off of the  4th Street freeway exit. On the right side of the street with big signs that is easy to spot. Convenient store and bathroom available, wheelchair accessible entrance.< /Text>

Employee screamed in my face when I finished using the bathroom. He did not inform me beforehand that the toilet was clogged and not to throw toilet paper. Proceeded to yell in my face for 2-3 minutes.</text>

I have been coming to this park since I was ten years old. Now, my kids enjoy playing here.  The park has a new fence and the entrance to the trail leading to Santiago park-Tustin is now closed.<//text>

In my 30's now. Good place to bring kids to the jungle Jim, have lunch with workmates the wife or your. girlfriend. Or just to come hang out with your friends after the heat of the day has subsided and cooled off. By lots of good eats and shopping... between main place mall and the outlets at Orange (formerly the block of Orange)<//Review>< Date>

Good park in a great neighborhood. About 4-6 tables in the back, a decently sized playground and a trail. Always good to stop here for 30 mins and enjoy a meal or a stroll for that matter. Restrooms are half the time dirty. Very little parking in front of the park and prohibited parking signs close to the park keeps this park rating at a solid 4.< /Text>

<pics>None< /pics><text>We use Fisher park a lot. Well... The cabin.. my kids always have a great time. Two play grounds with a few tables for picnic or party are good too. It's generally pretty clean. No cigarette buts around. However the bathroom is always an unhealthy disaster. The city could do a little better with that based on its location at least.

The biggest downfall is going to be the people who come there to smoke weed. Occasionally they're parked in their car right in plain sight not caring at all what anyone says and other times they're hiding in the ditch hoping no one notices. But we do... I'm really surprised the cops don't spend more time there.< /text><Rate>3</Rate>< GmapID>

<review>This park is great, except the playgroud its starting  to fade. And there are a couple of homeless hanging out. I didn't visit the bathrooms because they were a bit dark in my opinion, my son had amazing time rock climbing which  made me want to comw back.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd9cbaa85d199:0x70d67cbff50d995b</Gmap_id>< resp>

<text>Update:  They moved out of the Mo Val Mall, be sure you call ahead or verify the address.    This was my (11 year old) son's favorite place (now it's a bit far from us at it's bee location, and they recently didn't have Sonic comics).  Please keep in mind that the rest of this review was written as applied to their prior location in the mall: "Great selection of children's comic books!  I'm so glad that they keep these in one section and easily accessible so that my kids are not seeing graphics not appropriate for their age.  I recommend that if you bring kids, prepare them that there are no returns or exchanges, and be clear that these are collectors' items - kids can so easily rip or tear pages without intending to do so, and shouldn't flip through the pages prior to purchase.  The staff is knowledgeable and professional, just not "warm" with lots of smiles.  My son is okay with that - he is focused on the comic that he is getting - and I also think he likes that they take him seriously as a collector and customer, and they are not patronizing.  I also find that if I smile, they usually smile back.  Grateful to have this store in the Riverside/Moreno Valley area!  We will be back - often!"< /text><resp>{'time': 1506970777121, 'text': 'Thanks Carole.'}</resp><time>1532670403497<//time>< Pictures>

<text>Went there today. Great customer service from employees. I was greeted and ask if there was anything I need. Only downside is the owner. Employee sold me a card that was $3 but said it was damaged so he said he'll do it for $2. Great service from employee, however he went to help other customers which was fine. When I was ready the owner rang me up on the register and said it was $3.50. I told him his employee said it was Ganna be $2. Then he said "I'm the owner so the price stays." VERY RUDE. It's only a dollar difference but I'm a collector so I pay good attention to detail. So I didn't want to cause a scene so I just said have a great night. The owner didn't even look at me and say thank you or anything. The employees said their thank you. Rating would of been a  3 star but since it's the owners business he needs to work on his customer service skills. Yelp rated his business at a 2 1/2 STAR RATING. SAD 😔< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>
{'time': 1486880577643, 'text': 'There were actually some additional moving parts to this interaction. The staff did not communicate that he offered the item at a reduced price prior to going on break. I did offer you the item at the marked price of $3.00 not $3.50 as you stated in your post. I did respond when you said "Have great evening", and I was polite but firm in my dealing with the transaction. Upon returning from break I did ask my staff about the item, he confirmed that he had offered the item to you at a reduced price because of the condition of the item. I did review the item and I do apologize as this item should never have been offered for sale, and there should have been better communication on our part to insure that you enjoyed a better experience at our store.'}</resp>

✧( ु •⌄• )We'll be back again soon! ( •⌄• ू )✧

Pros:
- many MTG cards available (+a whole slew of other things)
- friendly staff that knows what's what
- having fun chatting about cards and gaining new knowledge + tips/terminology
- very well lit and ventilated room with plenty of open space making for a great hangout

Cons:
Absolutely NONE!  (\^ - ^/)<//review>< Pics>

I greet the employee at the door and stares at me with no response or greeting and after a few seconds goes back to whatever he was doing behind the computer. This disinterest in the customer continued through my visit. His attitude made me feel unwelcome in shopping here.< /review>

<Text>I've only been to this place twice, and both times I was long-winded with questions. I am always hesitant to buying loose TCG packs (YGO or Pkmn) from any store, and I've had few "interesting" experiences with previous stores that deal in TCG's, but the owner of this store is as genuine as they come. None of the single packs were ever weighed, he's honest about his deals, and on top of that, the prices are pretty dang fair. This is the perfect place to go for any TCG enthusiast out there!<//Text><user_id>111724147149759071207<//user_id>< Response>

Customer service was rude i have my daughter with me and i dont know much about the stuff in the store so i asked y is this toy $500.00 bucks i was curious a serious question this black man gives me a a smug look and talked down to me i figured if u wana know more about something u ask but when u ask and someone trys to make u feel dumb by the way he talks to awnsering your question in front of people Look if u want to get into trading cards collectibles or what ever dont go here there is rude customer service and people just put u down when your trying to find out about something i dont want no one to feel the way i do so dont come here if u dont know much about this stuff Lamaris is his name< /review>

Absolutely great customer service. Understood what I wanted and delivered to the letter.
I have been here many times for their services and have never been disappointed. Super clean and comfortable atmosphere no pushy sales just great service.
I was quoted a time frame and they were done sooner. They took the time to let me know when my goods were ready.
With competitive prices their service far outweighs any other company.
I highly recommend for any and all jewelry, watch, bracelet, charm services, sales and more.
Thank you,
Gus

<review>BE AWARE. Awesome customer service, BUT do not purchase jewelry from them. I purchased a “Alexandrite” stone from them which they told me was genuine then after said it was lab created. I was very disappointed, but I made the purchase and said what ever. NOW, here comes the juicy part of the story. I was gonna use this stone to propose to my now wife, so I sent the “Alexandrite” stone to get “GIA” certificate and all that good stuff in Carlsbad Ca. Couple weeks pass by and i go pick up the “Alexandrite”. Excited to hear the news. Well it was bad news. The stone was actually a lab created sapphire. Massive difference in price. With some research done I find out that it is a common thing that jewelers do to SCAM you because sapphires share almost identical colors of some Alexandrite. Long story short, If you value honesty, don’t shop at any of their locations. Same owner, same scammer. Imagine how I felt when I found Out I spent 2100$ for something that is worth somewhere around 140$.... lol<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaljMaQmxjgsUiW_73xphOJ15pCVIrlae3A4M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrcCgEkasoHVhbtCVp4ETjy_aaLgfBMWd3w-I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO30RqEHfpGxd3AByMNtGG4Iz52nmQF4vse1WI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>I took my ring to get a small accent diamond
Replaced and they suggested some preventative feature to assure
I would t lose any more, I liked that. I know it’s an up sell but I have lost diamonds in the past and didn’t know about that process so I went ahead and had it done. 1 day and it was ready. I brought them some other stuff now that I trust them to work on my fine jewelry.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Gmap_id>

<review>This is an outstanding jewelry repair shop with superior customer service and reception by Eunise, who carefully inspects each piece to be repaired and consults with Mike the in house expert for the cost estimate and time frame for repair. The pricing is fair and a good value for the quality of work. Cleaning of jewelry is also available and my individual pieces were restored to new gleaming luster.

Mike is a seasoned tradesman with a myriad of skills in watch repair, horologist, gemology, silversmith, diamond setter and jewelry knowledge and talent that is at the highest professional standards of his craft.

Fast-Fix is a hidden gem. They are independently owned and operated and with this particular location, a pride of ownership is shown, with professional etiquette, value and superior quality of work.

Highly recommend!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>This Jewelry Shop is the BESTI have ever been to. I went to the food court and came right back expecting to wait but my watch was fixed and looked great with my new band. This was the second time I came in the first was to fix 2 gold chains and other watches, by the time I came back from shopping they were ALL fixed FAST. They are very friendly and professional...FAST FIX DOES live up to their name.< /review><pics>None</pics></record>

I like this place, and they will fix your jewelry the same day. They are some cool people and typically always a good experience with them. Downside is that sometimes in my opinion certain things are a little bit overpriced,  depending on what you need. I still will recommend them to anyone and I would still check with them first.<//review>

Went in for a ring resizing but was informed tungsten can not be resized ( research before you buy lesson learned). But they helped me find my correct sizing for free. We ended up just having a few pieces of jewelry cleaned, great service and very quick turn around.</Review>

< review>
Amazing repair and sizing service. The team here is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. I had to get my fiancee's engagement ring resized and it was missing a diamond which I didn't even notice. They replaced the diamond and resized the ring with impeccable skill and expertise. Their pricing is fair and it's worth every penny. I will definitely be coming back in the future for any jewelry repair/sizing needs. Oh and not to mention...they completed both in less than hour and polished the ring to perfection!!! Thank you Fast-Fix Riverside team!</review>

Remarkable service. Fast, like the name implies and very courteous. I had three watch repairs today and it still only took an hour and they called me while I was still moving around in the mall to let me know that it was done ahead of time. I am very, very impressed.<//review>

<Review>I came to get a new stone set on my wedding band and walked out with the most uneven setting possible. I understand that the stone was bigger, but as a jeweler that's where the judgment comes in to let the customer know that a new base is needed. I was not told this when I dropped off my ring. This jeweler instead forces the stone in the setting and in the process bend the whole ring. Then has the odasity to Blame the band and the size of the stone.... No sir. That's not what should have happened, you should have have called me to let me know it could not be done and prevent damage to the stone and setting. Very sloppy job and unpleasant service. Now I have to take it elsewhere and spend more money to fix this jelwers work. Please save your money and precious jewelry and go elsewhere. I can't believe they would give the customer this kind of service and expect to get paid. Unbelievable.</Review><time>1602375145441< /time>< Gmap_id>

I rolled up at 6:55pm and the gates were closed, but employees were still inside. All I had to do was pick up the items and go, but they said they're sorry and they won't open up to give me my items. Now I have to come back tomorrow inconveniencing me for the evening and leaving me without a watch for my job. Not very professional from a PR standpoint. Very expensive as well with $25 for a battery exchange. Not coming here again! It's cheaper downstairs at the Time Repair place next to the Surf City Squeeze where I'm taking my other watches @ $15 a watch compared to $25.< /text><username>Taylor Nanney<//username>< date>

If you're looking to fix your watch, I suggest you don't waste your time looking for poor customer service and non responsive businesses. It took me a while to find them including some research. From now on I will look no further 🤍<//text>

Mario the jeweler was very professional and is a craftsman at its best! My ring that he worked on came out beautiful!!! Also... I was able to watch him as he precisely worked on my ring and he would stop and confirm with me changes or design before he continued. It is wonderful to wait while the work is done!  They are fast, efficient and reasonably priced. Definitely will use Mario and this business again!!!< /text>

I took a gold earring in to be repaired and received very professional and courteous attention. The repair was reasonably priced and was ready in an hour. I usually always come here to get my watch batteries replaced, occasionally to repair jewelry, and consistently get great service at reasonable prices. This review stands not just for this particular instance but for about the past 20 years. Well done, Fast-Fix!</Review>

Over the years we've used a few other jewelry & watch repair stores (including a Fast-Fix at a different location) and have been disappointed.

We took in a watch for a new battery, medical alert bracelet that needed links removed and I needed to have 2 earring posts replaced.

Erick's customer service is one that we don't see very often anymore.  He is friendly, professional and doesn't try to sell you something you don't need.

In fact, we didn't realize we had a 5 year battery warranty on the watch, so when Erick told us that, we were very pleased.

<review>My watch was fixed perfectly with a 5-year battery. The only thing I’m not happy about is that I never got a call or text saying that my watch was done. After an hour I had to go to the store to see what was going on and my watch was done. I did leave them my cell number, so I thought it was unusual to not get any notifications from them. As for their service, I’d give 5 stars.<//review></record></dataset><record>

You absolutely cannot beat the customer service, competitive prices, and quality of work...not to mention rocket speed! I had a family ring down sized for my pinky, they cleaned it and noticed a broken post and repaired it (which other jewelers missed). My ring is beautiful, and looks brand new!!< /review>

I had the best experience ever♥️  I had a prong replaced on my ring and I had 4 rings dipped in Rodium...My rings were just gorgeous and so sparkly after they were cleaned..
I couldn't  be happier with the results..It looks like I found myself a new Jeweler..😀 I would highly recommend this jewelry repair store to everyone. It is located in the Tyler mall on the top level near forever 21.. Thank you again for making my visit so pleasant..

Victor is such a nice guy. I'd buy a Casio from him because he's so nice. I went to his shop to get some watches appraised and couldn't find parking. The guy found a stall for me and even offered to pay the meter!
His appraisals were almost spot on and it was clear to me that his knowledge was extensive. While there, several patrons dropped by just to say "hi" and hangout. I'd highly recommend taking your watch to be repaired, appraised, consigned, whatever'd with Victor.</text>

<Text>pls beware they took the inside of my watch just to make money. I brought in my 2014 Omega constellation to change battery. Afterwards the watch started to leak. Then I brought it in to third party they told me this company took the inside of my watch then replace it into sth cheap. As a long term omega and rolex owner I want to warn you it’s easy to fool the outsider but sooner or later people who know what’s going on is gonna find out. Once you lose the trust it’s done< /Text>< date>

Fast Fix did an amazing job with my husbands gold necklace! He had a necklace and bracelet set that he wanted to join because he never wore the bracelet and wanted the necklace a lil bit longer. I didn’t have to wait for days it was done in an hour! They did such a good job you can’t tell it was two separate pieces. Their price was very reasonable! I’m taking my fine gold necklace to get repaired next. 5 stars for Fast Fix!!!!<//Text>

Went to get a new battery for my watch. Gentleman was very nice got it replaced in under 20 minutes. Price was fair gave me a 5 year warranty mentioned I can come back every year for a free battery replacement under warranty. Also the 2 girls at the front were very nice.<//Review>

<review>I had my battery replaced on my GShock with no problem. I was quoted $29 to have the battery replaced and to set the time. The person that replaced the battery stated that she was unable to set the hands correctly to match the LCD that is also on the face. Once I arrived home I YouTube it and it was simple. She said she did YouTube it and it didn’t work. Maybe a little more effort next time.

She did discount 10 percent off the price for not being able to set the time. That was greatly appreciated.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><name>David Rodriguez</name><GmapID>0x80dcb7357fc31ccb:0x8c0a7117afa3591c</GmapID>< user>

Given the size of the bracelet for a one year old the detail of the engravement came our amazing. The price was also a great deal. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to engrave or personalize any piece of jewelry<//text>

I had been bringing my Movado Sport watch here for decades, and the ladt timeI brought it in for a new battery was 2018 for a one year warranty battery for $7. Well the battery died 2 years later so I brought it in and this time asked for the 5 year warranty battery. I was told $24.95 so I said ok. They call me 15 minutes later and said "sorry but for Movado it is $69 for a battery." They knew it was a Movado when I brought it in, they wrote it on the claim ticket, and I was in their database. They knew my name when I gave them my phone number and saw that I always bring in my Movado. So someone in the back decides to gouge me for more than double the price for the same battery just because it is a Movado? DON'T bring your quality watches here, theywill double the price just for the brand even though it is the same 5 year battery!  I had been bringing my business there for decades but not anymore. They just lost a long term customer. They write up the price then change it because they think you're rich and gouge you deep. Never again!< /text>

<Review>Wonderful customer service, very knowledgeable on all aspects of jewelry & watches. I brought in a gold chain, that my Dad gave to my son, vintage style of a chain....also came with wear and tear.
They explained what they could do to give it a "quick fix" & also gave me a very reasonable quote on how much it would be to restore it 100%.
My daughter & I also had to get our watches fixed, less than 30 minutes for both to be ticking like new!
Thank you for all the help.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Came in to get a citizen watch crystal fixed. Initially, the girl who attended me qouted me on the cost incorrectly. Mistakes happen so I was ok with leaving the watch to be priced for repair properly. Once I was called back and given a price, I agreed to the estimate only to pick up the watch and find scratches and dirty marks all on the inside and outside of the crystal that had supposedly been replaced for a brand new one. I was in a rush, being I had to pick up my child from school leaving it once again to be fixed. I was guaranteed by the manager, Erick, that the crystal would be fixed to perfection only to be back today and find the watch in worse conditions than the first repair.  I was attended by Micheal who was very helpful and understanding up to the extent where he could help me. He proceeded to direct me to Marco to further assist me, who gave me the worst customer service experience I've ever had.  Besides being over all rude, I was basically told that a scratched watched was the best I could get for what I was being charged. On top of that he proceeded to insinuate that I was just trying to be picky to receive a refund. I didn't not set the pricing, I simply solicited a service, was given a price, paid that price, and expected my service to be provided with the perfection I was guaranteed by a manager. Upon my experience with marco, I proceeded to ask for a manager only to find that one was not on shift at all. The most frustrating part of this whole experience is wasting my time and gas,  being I come all the way from Hemet. Three trips and counting for something that should have been done on the first shot. Super unprofessional.<//Review><Date>1578714105837<//Date><user_id>101182650314168763971< /user_id></record>

<review>I needed a new watch battery and a safety chain for my pearl bracelet. As always, they were quick to fix both items. They are friendly and very helpful.  Unfortunately, the new safety chain came apart the next morning, before I could wear the bracelet.  I took it back to get it fixed, and had to leave it there.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb7357fc31ccb:0x8c0a7117afa3591c</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Needed a watch repaired and link taken out.
Cheap and was able to pick up right away.   They have also fixed a necklace, which has since broken again, so will be bringing it back again.  They are friendly and helpful.< /Text>

Very good experience. Friendly knowledgeable staff. Printing was very good. I do all of my jewelry repairs at this store. Ever though we have moved to Tennessee if I have a need for a repair I hold off on fixing til I come back to visit. Then have I fixed while I’m hear.</Review>

My only pair of prescription eyeglasses broke. I'm currently without a job so don't have any vision insurance. I had to get these things fixed. I called up to ask if they fix glasses and they said they would so I went down to the Riverside location at the Galleria. They looked at them and told me it would be roughly 20 bucks and I said that's better than buying a new pair of glasses. It took them about 30 minutes and they actually custom-made a screw to put my glasses back together and they're just like new. Props to the manager Nathan he explained what he had to do and was very courteous and very friendly. I would definitely recommend Fast Fix to anybody who needs their jewelry watches or eyeglasses repaired.</Text>

I do want to start by saying the manner of the girl at the register was very pleasant and did all she could to take care of my request. But, I was disappointed with the lack of total customer satisfaction with the jeweler , I took a broken metal watch band to either be fixed or a new one would be best the jeweler was 6-7 feet from me and NEVER gave me a good solution so I went with the recommendation of the girl and when i picked it up my watch which is a decent one went from very nice to kinda cheap.  The jeweler didnt think of an open link that would be exposed to many and isnt a proper feel for this band.
So OVERALL NOT a good outcome< /Text>

Also, if you have old vintage jewelry this is a safe place to take it as well. I had a vintage piece of jewelry and the jeweler was able to give me so much information on what era, type of stone and took great care to preserve the original state of the piece.

Priscilla was amazing! I broke my glasses again took them to Fast-food and. had them back 2 hours later! I was originally told I couldn't have them because the Jeweler that knew how to use the Laser was not there. Well, the Jeweler. that was there learned to use the machine and fixed. my glasses! Thank you much!  :)<//Text>

Battery was dead in my wife’s three year old Movado Bold watch. They sold me a $64.95 replacement with a 5 year warranty. They mentioned that I can bring it in every year for a free battery replacement. Good service and I trust them.< /Review>

Kinda pricey and as well to have basic stuff to be replaced besides a battery. They charge a fee even though you paid for the replacement part. Other than that is ok.</Review>

I’ve been going to Fast Fix for watch batteries for several years. I like their battery program where you get a 5 year warranty for $30. After the initial purchase you just take your watch in when the battery dies and they replace it free for 5 years. Staff is friendly and and it only takes a few minutes for them to do the job.<//review>

Super nice and it didn't take too long for a watch battery replacement, took about 30 minutes. It was a pretty good price for the warranty.</Text>

I resized my ring here and when I first came in the lady said it would be a 2 hour job. I received a price quote and dropped it off the next day. Was told it would be done the following day by 2 pm. I drive down to the shop and was told the jeweler had not come in and the ring would be done the next day by 12:30 pm. It was done by 3 pm the next day.

When I received the ring it was covered in scraps and scratches. I had them buff out all the scratches and it looked okay enough but I wasn’t happy with the end product and the engraving I received. My ring was a thicker than normal ring for my fiancé. I was told because of the thickness it was difficult to resize after the fact. Now I wonder if I would have been better off taking the ring to a larger chain jewelry store where they have to ship the ring out.</review>

I brought my jewelry into Fast-Fix to have them cleaned and polished and I was amazed with the results. Marcos cleaned and polished my jewelry so good they looked new. Pricilla their sales girl was extremely professional and quoted great rates for cleaning and polishing  of my jewelry. I would highly recommend everyone and anyone to bring their jewelry to FAST-FIX Jewlers they do Quality Work 😀<//Review>

<Review>When the whole main solitaire diamond fell out of my 16th birthday day ring that was from my mom that is passed away now.., I was is such distraught and panick of trying to find the most perfect place that I could trust to set it back in with new made prongs and a just a perfect job. I am 27 now and never everrr take it off since I was 16. The prongs wore down to completely nothing and the diamond fell out that I was in complete peace and relief when I found it in my house, and peace and relief is what I got with the jeweler job as well, with my most cherished possession from my mother.. He made it so gorgeous and like new again, with a safe and secure diamond for good again.  Thank you so very much..♥️< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>Very fast. Very nice. The lady inside with the stretchers in her ears did make a somewhat rude remark though. While i was asking to see various pieces of jewelry, a few rings were left on the counter. She snapped on the employee saying that he shouldn’tve done that (which of course i agree. You never know what could happen) but she said that it’s because i could have easily stolen them. The tone she used did come off as a bit harsh.<//text><Time>1537549105091</Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>First time customer for Fast Fix. I needed to resize a ring of mine to a larger size. Good and helpful service. The price was very reasonable.  You can't tell that it was resized at all. And it fits perfectly now. I'm very happy with the outcome. I would definitely go back for any other repairs or add ons.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I took my Seiko watch to have the battery replaced and the girl looked at it and said it would be $29 because it had some extra setting knobs for a smaller clock within the watch face so it was more complicated. I figured it would be a little extra work to set the time due to this little clock once the battery was replaced. My husband picked up the watch for me and didn’t notice they didn’t even bother setting the time! I noticed it the next day when I tried to use it. I paid extra for nothing.< /Text>

I took my Seiko watch to have the battery replaced and the girl looked at it and said it would be $29 because it had some extra setting knobs for a smaller clock within the watch face so it was more complicated. I figured it would be a little extra work to set the time due to this little clock once the battery was replaced. My husband picked up the watch for me and didn’t notice they didn’t even bother setting the time! I noticed it the next day when I tried to use it. I paid extra for nothing.<//review>

Straight forward, didn't try wasting my time selling me on extra services. Paid $10 for my watches broken pin to be replaced on the strap, reasonable & fast repair. Miguel is a professional young gentleman. Thank you!<//review>

Did not like my experience at all.I went there the beginning of June and they told me it takes a week to get my part.I called in a week and they told the part hasnt came in yet.I called them the next week and said it will be ready the next so I called and they told me it still will be a week so we can get it.I was confused because they had told it would be ready already.Finally I called for my last time and told them I wanted a refund and they told me the part is now shipping and will get tomorrow.So I told them if is not ready I get my money right?They told me ya.All of a sudden they get the part and for the first time call me and tell they get the part and will ready tomorrow.I told I don't even want my watch anymore and will just like my money back.Now they tell they can't cause the watch is apart and will now not work.Like how if I left it working I would like  it be working still.Fianlly got the finished product back and doesn't look right but honestly just for not trying work with no more I didn't tell them anything else.Honesty I will never come back and would rather to real professional that can leave good quality product back.I also got my product back on 06/28/2017

I was charged $69 to change my watch battery. After my purchase I googled average cost to change Movado battery. According to Google battery cost $5 and average cost for install is $25.  I regret not checking on this before hand.</review>
