<review>They sell a shake that I believe to be the best tasting I've ever had. It's a Butter Pecan Shake. It comes with a wafer cookie and topped with whipped cream. Regular is $5.00 and the Large is $7.00<//review><time>1600076406829< /time>< rate>

<review>Very friendly service, a wide selection of raspados, juices, snacks, and the best part is if you want to personalize your raspado (you can combine flavors) they will make it just they way you like it, just ask. Clean and very attentive. Everyone who works here is happy and friendly. Service with a smile. The fruit is always fresh (they chop everything). Their new paletas have me excited, there are so many flavors, so creamy, so delicious. The cheese paleta is one of my favorite. They have something for everyone.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2d66ae984c1ad:0x32f7121c046b88df< /Gmap_id><resp>None</resp><time>1562046205627</time>< userid>

<review>Woah, so many juice options! Their root beer floats aren't bad either. I went here on a typical LA hot AF summer day and was super parched after riding my motorcycle. Raspados Zone was in the area and I was fiending something to quench my thirst. Ordered a smoothie and a root beer float because why not. Oh man, the smoothie was made fresh and on the spot, the flavors are all upfront and you can taste how fresh they were, and the root beer float was pretty good too. Just a warning, though; don't do what I did by ordering both a smoothie and a float because you won't be able to finish both.</review>< Pics>

Nothing like a good old Raspado on a hot day. So refreshing and tasty. Made to order for each person. So many veritys of flavors and drinks with refills. Nice and happy staff and handicapped parking and access and table seating and public restrooms. Their prices are not that bad. A good place to visit throughout the summer and year round.</review>

<Review>The corn had mold in it and the syrup for the raspado was cross contaminated. Not a good place to go to if you have a major allergic reaction to nuts, milk,etc. The corn was the worst though it was dry and shribbled and moldy.<//Review><Time>1575975836640< /Time>< Rate>

< Review>
Just took my family here and I purchased a Butterfinger bar. As I was eating the bar it tasted funny. I looked at the best by date and it read 7/2018 smh.. the employee in charge told me to get another one. As I checked they all had about a ten month old date. I told the employee I hope I don't get sick and he replied you should be fine. SMH I would like to see him drink 10 month old milk. I have a good feeling it will get me sick.. I will no longer take my family to this place who knows what else is expired.< /Review>

My family loves raspados, we thought it would be nice to try a new place. Waste of money , the mango one was frozen mango and it tasted like chemicals. It didn't taste real. We'll not be back and we'll continue going to our raspado place on Francisquito and Azusa. Highly recommended and the girls are nice there.<//Text>

I tried it. I chose the milk base vanilla. It was delicious and came with two almonds. I suggest the large since it costs about the same to the small. I rate it 5*.< /Text>

The diablitos are really good, which is what I think they specialize in. But the corn is nowhere near the corn man/lady the cheese and the chili have a different taste, I threw mine away as long as you don't expect that it's an ok place and the employees are really nice.<//review>

Love this place! I try ordering something new every time I go. Staff is always friendly and ready when you are. It's hard finding an elotero wo(man) these days, so if you're craving a good normal sized elote/esquite or even a churro como los del swapmeet, this is the place to go. And unlike other places where they don't give you at all what you pay for, this place leaves you wanting more and being able to get more for your buck.</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The place very good the employees very cordial the problem the esquites lacks flavor you do not feel the sabador of the epasote which is what it must feel to taste them on the other hand the churros have a slight flavor of refrigeration I suggest adding a little cinnamon and making the churros on the premises everything else excellent luck in your business

Took my wife on a date night to eat sushi and watch the sunset nearby. The rolls here are amazing. The specialty roll selection is very limited, however the few they have are all very good. The fish in the rolls is top notch. Look forward to the day I can sit in the restaurant and enjoy the atmosphere. The rolls are worth every dollar.</review>

Probably the best sashimi I've had so far in SD. Unimposing storefront in a small shopping plaza with it's own parking lot - though limited parking outside per usual of downtown La Jolla.

Can't describe the sashimi except that you must come and try for yourself! Pleasant outdoor patio of sorts for all your COVID friendly needs.</Text>

Great place for sushi on weekdays. Weekends it gets very busy so get a reservation ahead of time.

One of my two favorite sushi spots in SD. I believe these guys once worked at Ota too, or they are owned by the same company.</review>

Friendly staff, great food. The Treasure Bowl has most of what you want already in it and is pretty sizeable. Chicken karaage bowl is amazing and a go-to of you don't like raw fish. One of the few places in San Diego that actually serve REAL wasabi.</Review>

Secret. This may not be a secret amongst many sushi lovers but himitsu is Fantastic! Located in La Jolla this little gem boasts one of my favorite omakase in San Diego. Choosing your tea cup or sake cup is also an interesting experience to add to the atmosphere.< /Text>

I would recommend making a reservation as it’s easy to spend a couple hours enjoying good company in their cozy outdoor setting, eating delicious and fresh sushi and drinks served with much attention to detail.

We tried to go impromptu for late lunch when we arrived in La Jolla and all their tables were either half way through their meal or reserved so we decided to come back another time; let me tell you that making a reservation was a breeze and the staff was super courteous over the phone.

The portions are smaller but typical of a more upscale restaurant and everything is top quality; to name a few, the toro melts in your mouth, the scallops have a delicate flavor and the warm miso makes you feel right at home.  Our server was sincerely friendly and knowledgeable about the fish they were serving that night. If you’re drinking sake, you get to choose your own cup, which is a lot of fun, and our server was even knowledgeable about what kind of cup was better for what kind of sake.
I also loved how the chef thanks you for coming in Japanese as you’re leaving. We had a great experience at Himitsu!< /text>

<Review>We decided to do the omakase. The majority of the dishes were all amazing. The fish was excellent. The lack of 5 stars for me was we also asked for a sake pairing and it wasn't really a pairing just a bunch of sake picked by the server with no guide on what goes with what. The other issue I personally had was raw baby squid. Not great, not something that should be served. The other down side was we had to order an extra roll as the $170 per person chefs choice wasn't enough food. The roll was outstanding though. Next time we go here we will order off the menu so we have better control of the meal.</Review><name>Kevin Luther</name><Gmap_id>0x80dc03e376700407:0xe6521b675eaa605</Gmap_id></record>

Where you can find authentic, extremely fresh and tasty sushi. With too much attention to the details and precisely wrapped, each roll is a piece of art.
Thank you for your great service Himitsu!</review>

Himitsu is a quaint restaurant in La Jolla Cove serving high-end sashimi and nigiri alongside a compact menu of small plates and rolls. My visits to Himitsu have provided a generous amount of excellent sushi, and a warm experience that has rivaled my sushi experiences in Tokyo. The space consists of an outdoor patio and a handful of sushi bar seats which you should hope to reserve when dining here. A strong social vibe pervades the small sushi bar, isolated in its own intimate solarium where one has the opportunity to know their chef and fellow diners.

Behind the sushi bar is Chef Mitsu Aihara, formerly of Sushi-Ota. If you are fortunate enough to sit at the sushi bar and have Chef Mitsu attend to you personally, you MUST order the omakase, as Chef Mitsu delivers one of the best and most innovative omakase experiences in San Diego, proving to be similarly skilled to his mentor, Chef Ota. A friendly character with a natural ability to effortlessly create Instagram-able food porn, Chef Mitsu takes the time to know the diner he is serving and customizes the omakase experience for that person -- I noticed I was getting slightly different sushi than he was serving the couple next to me who were also doing omakase. The fish came out fast-and-furious and, two hours into it, I finally needed to tap out after being served an ultra-rich hand roll containing uni, "melt-in-your-mouth" otoro, and salmon roe, for what seemed like my 25th course in.

Much of Himitsu's fish is flown in overnight from Japan, though some of it is locally-caught as well. A few of my favorites that aren't as popular at other sushi joints in San Diego included the buttery "Black Throat Sea Perch" and the naturally sweet "Triggerfish," topped with its own white, sticky liver when served nigiri-style.

As other reviews have noted, Chef Mitsu loves Japanese sardines, here served as both nigiri and sashimi, somewhat fatty and slippery in texture and with a clean but concentrated flavor of fish. This is a unique piece of sushi I've not had elsewhere that reminded me of Red Boat 40°N, a favorite fish sauce in my household.

Mid-way through my omakase, I was offered Shirako, which Chef Mitsu described as "an appetizer, like eggs." Since I've had Shirako before, I shot back, "don't you mean sperm?", and so ended the ruse, as my fellow diners at the bar all soured their faces at once, and I enjoyed my cod sperm sacs, here served raw in a ponzu sauce -- its creamy white blobs sharing both the texture and taste of the fried belly parts of whole belly fried clams, but without the deep-fried batter.

Other sushi I've had here has included Otoro, Chutoro, Marinated Blue Fin Akami, Local Spiny Lobster, Salmon Belly, Hamachi Belly, Uni, Stripejack, Raw Squid, Seared Squid with Shiso and Eel Sauce, Needlefish, Octopus, Razor Clam, Albacore, Ocean Eel, Kelp-Marinated Halibut, and Wagyu Beef. All have been served fresh and, at minimum, have met my expectations. Additionally, I've ordered the "Salmon Jalapeño," similar to Nobu's famous "Hamachi Jalapeño," but Himitsu's choice to use "candy-striped" salmon meat leads to a more dramatic presentation despite a slight loss of richness.

I'm admittedly a bit of a sushi snob, but I don't need to gorge myself at spendy outlets like Tadokoro, Kaito, or Ota to be satisfied. However, due to the overall dependability of these restaurants, their sourcing of supremely high-quality seafood, and the mouth-watering plates of sashimi served, I am often willing to spend a little extra. Himitsu is such a place I'll open my wallet up for, and should be considered to be in the apex tier of sushi restaurants in San Diego.<//text>

Hands down best sushi I’ve ever had. This coming from someone who’s lived in NY all his life and has his fair share of great East Coast sushi. The toro melts on your tongue and is so tender you feel like you barely need to chew it. It’s hard to have sushi anywhere else after eating here.</text>

<text>Probably the best sushi I've had in years. Unlike most places they don't flaunt an obscene number of novelty rolls. Instead they focus on am excellent selection of lesser known fish. That's not to say that the favorites aren't there. Both their sake belly and hamachi belly were respectable and their o toro was easily the best I've ever had. And the uni (both the local San Diego and the Japanese) were phenomenal. But I was pleasantly surprised by the Japanese sardine, the black cod, and the golden eye snapper. All were very good. And the saba, though not pickled like the rest I've had, was simply amazing.

Though we don't normally get desserts we opted to try the yuzu panna cotta and were blown away. Most japanese restaurants stick with simple fare like green tea ice cream, but not Himitsu. It was light and refreshing and a perfect end to a perfect meal. I am completely fulfilled.

<Text>Great food, fun to sit at Sushi bar.
Enjoyed all food ordered. Really enjoyed the salmon and yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno...
Only downside is no bathroom for customers. Need to go to alternate site of the strip mall. Remember 5 digit code to bathroom.....just saying<//Text>< Date>

Ate here for dinner for my last night in California. Excellent food and excellent service! We ordered the shrimp sushi (the shrimp heads were delicious!), blue fin tuna from Spain, a California roll, sweet shrimp sushi, and the mango sherbet for dessert. Also ordered sparkling rose wine and sake. The server was very attentive and helpful with suggestions. Great dining atmosphere. Highly recommend!</Text>

Best Sushi restaurant in San Diego, CA (in my critical opinion). A small jewel in the jewel (La Jolla). Highest quality fish, unique attention to detail from the interior design to their chop sticks and beer glasses. Suoer friendly service. Just great all around.<//Review>

Great quality sushi, better than many of what I experienced in Japan even. Staff were friendly and knowledgable. Very reasonable price too. I see some criticism for pricing here, but they obviously don't know the fair price for this quality of sushi. The price is not a secret or anything, it's up to you to check on it before ordering something you don't know much or appreciate  ┐('д')┌</Review>

Prepare yourself to pay around 200 bucks for two persons. Nothing against the food here, but with this price, I'd rather go to Donovan's steakhouse. I can at least look at the ocean while enjoying my meal instead of sitting in the parking place to eat my food.</Text>

Amazing experience in La Jolla today. Everything was exquisite- we decided on Omakase and it was perfect. Every course was better than the next and our sushi chef Derek was the best!!
Thank you for making our night out super special.<//review>

<Text>The food was very tasty, but the portions too small and the price too high!! We ordered food to take away and were negatively surprised by the huge amount of plastic boxes that we trashed just 10 minutes later. It could've been packed in a more minimalistic way. One of us ordered a dish coming in 8 pieces, only to realize they had made 7... Such mistakes give kind of a mitigated impression, especially for the price we paid. The waitress taking the order seemed irritated by our presence and after making a mistake in the order, gave us a 1cent (!!!) discount... No joke.
The rest of the staff seemed very friendly though.
Bottom line: nice food, too much trash, I'll go elsewhere next time I'm hungry.< /Text>< pics>

Very fresh traditional style sushi and sashimi. Ordered some of the daily specials like local yellowtail (buri) and was wonderful.  The Hamachi kama was juicy and meaty. Loved everything we ordered. Sat at the sushi bar. Though they do have some covered outdoor seating. Make reservations.< /review>

If you are looking for a perfect spot for dining and amazing fresh sushi this is the place to go. You can't go wrong with their nigiri choices and daily picks. Make sure you try their toro and salmon belly.</Text>

Good sushi and nice, but for the price I would rather go to Sushi Ota or Tadokoro</review>

My favorite new Sushi in town by far. Even after coming back from a recent trip to Japan I still think this place is great. High quality fish, great service, and creative menu. The Omakase is pricey but well worth it. Mitsu san is also a great host and very friendly. He recently hosted a special Mexican-Japanese fusion dinner with a former chef from Puyol in Mexico City and it was a great experience. I hope he hosts more of those. Don’t forget to try the non-sushi appetizers in the menu!</text>

average at best. no o-toro, ankimo, etc.   I really like ota, but this isn't comparable. Nice, comfortable spot, though</Review>

<Text>An absolutely wonderful experience. The chef, Mitsu, presented a mix of flavors that delighted our palate. The decor is intimate and relaxed. The service was attentive without being intrusive. A bit pricey but it is a premier sushi experience in La Jolla.</Text>< Pics>

Pictures are better than reality. Quite cold outside and nothing special for that price. No toilet in the restaurant - they give you the key for one quite far away with some homeless people nearby - not so cool for that price.</text>

Himitsu is a phenomenal La Jolla gem that serves incredible sushi. Certainly expensive, but no doubt worth the price!<//text>

Outstanding sushi by Ota-trained Itamae Mitsu. Large seasonal selection of hard to find traditional Japanese fishes and excellent cooked/non-sushi items as well. Fantastic sake selection.</text>

<time>1511956496656</time><text>First time here and it's hands down one of the best sushi spots in all of San Diego.

Beautiful, quaint atmosphere, friendly service, ridiculously fresh fish, what more could one want of life? We made reservations several days ahead so we could sit at the coveted sushi bar. WORTH IT!

Chef Mitsu, the owner and head sushi chef (ex Sushi Ota) was extremely enthusiastic and entertaining. He was cracking jokes all night and had us laughing the minute we sat down.

I highly recommend the seared scallops, miso black cod, wagyu and puro toro.

Come here, you won't be disappointed.< /text>< resp>

<text>First time I went here Micah helped me out, I planned on only buying a bowl and he upsold me for so many neat / needed things I ended up loving and I appreciated his honesty and efficiency. I came back because of the positive experience and Michael helped me out and he was very helpful and friendly as well. Great employees keep customers coming back. I was willing to spend more than I had planned because of how nice / respectful they were. Even threw in some CBD for me, thanks guys! See you guys next time!<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1612362930278, 'text': 'Hi Kristina,\nThank you for the review, we appreciate your business!\n\nThanks,\nWild Side Marketing'}<//resp>< gmapID>

I Called them first ( didn't want to waste my gas) talked to Anton ( pretty sure that was his name) he was very cordial, and friendly and answered with a pep in his step. Apparently my ex frequents the place every couple of weeks. He always comes out of there with a smile in his face. They use alot of bubble wrap to protect what you purchase, I recycle it and wrap all the breakable things that I don't need to store in my garage (until doomsday comes, or till I pass away and my kids throw all my precious bubble wrapped things in a big green dumpster)😋. Hey save the earth! Right? I'm doing my part, 🤔are you? 🙄😇< /Review>

<text>Of course quality things are expensive because you get what you pay for. They give deals like no other shop. Regular glass pieces, lighters, etc, they always give discounts. The employees are knowledgeable, friendly, & very helpful. These reviewers say they get new glass & it breaks, which doesn't happen by itself, & expect a free replacement? Or a free $47 charger cuz they spent $250 ? They don't mention any shop that replaced a broken piece for themselves or anyone else. No shop does that. Clumsy folks should buy silicone. Maybe whatever they're smoking is too strong, & they should stick to lawn clippings or oregano.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I wish I could say I've had a purchase from here that lasted longer than a few months...or days in this case

2 times I've come in on different occasions to be sold items that have been defective. Whether it be cracked glass or just plain stopped working. They don't sell quality items unless you want to pay ungodly sums of money for the few brand name non glass devices.

Their staff is not up to date with modern Cannabis Culture technology, especially Dry Herbal vapes, Dabbing technology/Innovations, and most importantly...prices.

I'll give them a pass on a few things they've tried to push on me but ultimately when they say "Dude you're not gonna find anything that this doesn't do about the same." They mean than what they have in their store...

Unfortunately they're a needed evil in Camarillo because they have the largest selection without possibly having to order online and waiting. You'll pay in 2nd rate devices & materials and more than it's worth paying but sometimes you need things.

You cannot count on the employees to be honest so go in KNOWING what you want or the combination of lack of knowledge & wanting a sales commission check will sway them from helping you find what you're looking for. That or they just ignore what your interests are.

Just being honest.< /Review>< Time>

Overpriced.  Sign on window says  "Beats Internet Prices " It doesn't say anything about restrictions.  I bought a mod unit and it was at full MRP. Afterward I found the same item on several online sites for  about 45% less.  They told me that the USB cable in the kit was for charging.  This is wrong! The batteries have to be charged in a separate unit.  Since the mod I bought was at the highest suggested retail price, about double the price online and I was inconvenienced and had to go back the next day to buy the battery charger I thought they should comp the charger.
The employee called her manager to see what he would do for me.
He said the statement on the window only applied to the manufacturer's online site.  Even  so,  they didn't beat their online price.  The store price was the highest/full price, the same as the online price.  That constitutes false advertising!
The manager offered me only 15% off the charger.  Terrible customer service, especially for a customer who spent about $250 the day before.
I will never go back to Wild Side.  I went to the one in Camarillo.
I advise everyone to avoid this store.  Shop online!!!
Since the customers (about 6 within 20 minutes) were spending on the average of only 5 - 10 dollars,  they really should have treated someone spending over $250 with a greater sense of appreciation and given me the $47 charger for free.  They had the chance to make a customer for life.  Instead they lost a customer forever!</Text>

They raised their prices on kratom by 50 dollars on the kilo. Wow! Its more than double what you can get it for online! I recently purchased it prior to this ridiculous price hike to find out it was overstock from another store the salesman told me when I tried returning it for it not working at ALL! zero potency! BUNK! They would not let me return or even exchange for a product that worked like I paid for! I did get store credit for things I did not want or need at the time. I told them to take the discolored product of their shelves so other customers would not get ripped off paying for an expensive product that doesn't work. Their currently still selling it so beware.<//text>

Since we opened 13+ years ago, this little block that we are on has always been home to cool, funky, independent businesses.

<review>Wide diversity of genres and frighteningly knowledgeable staff. Pile of free vinyl out front some of which some people probably need. On the same block you can get your boots fixed, buy a glass of exotic wine, then catch a carne asada on the corner.</review>< pics>

<text>By far my favorite record shop in San Diego. Excellent vibe, rare finds, top notch customer service and customer experience.  I was so stoked to find them open today amidst the pandemic. With all this social distancing, businesses closing and civil unrest going on in the world today it was most refreshing to find this spot open for business; The impact of which had such a positive effect on my mood and outlook.
Every single time I crawl through the crates here I find something I LOVE and something I'm already looking for. My jam is 7" vinyl
Support local! Vist this shop! Spend some money and tell Mark the owner i sent you.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9z5Xct8mZApivIMM9by_QcyYYZEQH5w6u1YU5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmXfD_BYw8EnrPfdpAoq4R234VvxwdeVc5ifA3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

Smaller selection but had tons of super niche vinyl, particularly hip hop and rap records. If you like niche records or hip hop/rap LPs, FeelIt is a great place to go.</Review>

The time has flown by these past 12+ years...

Great shop, a must if you are in San Diego. The owner is a very nice person, very competent and ready to give suggestions which are very valuable. I picked up four vinyls based on his recommendations and I am really looking forward to get back home and listen to them.

This is a great record store in downtown San Diego. A good selection of funk, soul, hip-hop and rock. The guy there is really friendly and he had some recommendations for me. And his pal complimented my R.E.M. T-shirt so they've definitely got good taste! Will definitely return next time I visit San Diego.< /review>

It's small, however if you're into hard to find tasteful selections this is the spot. Mark was not only helpful, he also had some stellar insight into the driving forces behind some of my favorite music.< /review>

<date>1564116708193< /date><rating>5<//rating><review>I'm into vinyl for a long time now and everywhere I go I like to visit some genuine shop for some crate-digging and that's exactly what I did in FeeLit today. Bought three albums (totally different genres : Bobby Womack, Gavin Friday and Til Tuesday) for a fair secondhand price. The owner is very kind and openminded, a real service in these downloading times of music as superficial background noise. So, if you can relate to these sentences above written by an enthousiastic Belgian tourist : go there, look around and buy something. This is the only way to make sure that guys like this can stay into business and enrich the streets of our cities with personal flavors. Keep it up.

<rating>5</rating><text>Very easy going, friendly. I found some great vinyl records for afro-cuban, mambo and tango... What a nice place to hang.... I enjoy buying from local stores. It's sad to see many small and charming local stores fade out because of all the big corporate franchising and online business. Some people made reviews that it's over priced but we also need to consider that it's not easy to sustain private business like this against large corp. These local stores make our community charming and beautiful.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Was at this recordstore today. Was to open at noon but was till closed at 12.30. Waited about 15 minutes but still nobody showed up. Very disappointed. Either open on time or make sure your store information on the internet is listed correctly. Visiting record stores in the USA coming from abroad, but this was a real bummer. Won’t consider comming here again.<//Review>< name>

I am curious what you saw, that you felt was overpriced so I can look into it and correct it if necessary. We all know that anyone with wi-if can virtually price shop with their phone. This is the reason that we use multiple sources to verify market value, based on condition. We also have suggested retail prices that are provided by our distributors, Labels, and artists. I am always open to discussing a price, adjusting if needed, and accepting offers.\nThank you again for your time,\nMarkalan - Owner'}<//Resp>

<name>Matthew Talmadge</name><date>1621352031602</date><rating>1<//rating><Review>Poor customer service. Will take full advantage of an opportunity to sell you a bike.
One of the few shops that will not let you test ride a bike before you purchase. If you don't like the bike your S.O.L. and stuck with it. They will tell you that you can return it if you don't like it but first you have to sign their contracts to ride the bike, now you legally bound to the bike.  They tell you it's because their insurance wont allow test rides, but geez your selling motorcycles! Get and insurance company that will let you do business ethically. Your competitors allow test rides why cant you?
How do you expect your customers to make and informed decision before purchasing, by sitting on the bike in the showroom. Seriously, your in the business of selling motorcycles a test ride is giving your customers a chance to make a sound decision.
Save yourself the headache and purchase from a shop that will let you test ride because there are plenty out there.
Lesson learned the hard way I will never spend another dime at this shop.</Review>< pics>

Good place for parts. They'll have it in stock. But you might get someone coming out to the sidewalk to sell you extra things. Not sure if they're actually working for the place or not.<//Review>

<Text>I bought my Ninja 650 from Samantha, who was absolutely a pleasure to work with; professional, quick responses, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Even though she was super busy every time I was there, it seemed as though she treated me like I was the only one in the store. I also would like to mention Beau the service manager who had done work on my bike, and not to my surprise did an amazing! job ! Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for anybody who is looking for great customer service and great people. Oh, and great bikes!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x8085735ec75b4171:0x32f183463ec70722</gmapID></record>

The guys there are cool.. Bo (service writer /parts guy) is also very knowledgeable  in what he does.. I've been having my bike serviced there since about 2008..  He is very up front about work that's needed and the cost.. Usually, the price there is less expensive than most reputable shops.. I would definitely refer these guys to a friend..

<text>I purchased my bike from Arlen Ness but will be taking it to Powersports of Vallejo for all my services. These guys are the best shop around with the best customer service. I came in for my first 500 mile service and ended up buying a really awesome victory jacket. I have gotten many compliments on it.  After calling various other shops, even shops out of state trying to find answers, I talked with Bo and he had the information I was looking for. This convinced me to trust this shop for all my needs. It is worth the drive for me coming from Walnut Creek. You will not be disappointed here.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x8085735ec75b4171:0x32f183463ec70722< /GmapID></record>

<review>Talked about most of the payment optons over the phone and was accurate +/- $1. Went to pick up my new bike and all paperwork done, driving off the lot in what felt like 20 minutes. No hassle or pushing to get extended warranties or extra insurance. Really proffesional and great guys to work with. Will buy from them in the future.<//review>< Name>

I will not be shopping here ever again. I gave them a couple of chances to see if it was just a one time thing. Note to everyone. When i went in there was a 20% restocking fee on all parts, shelf items or ordered and No returns on some of the clothing! You only find this out if you read your recipt or move all the crap covering the post on the counter. My service was short and rude the other time i went in. I also would give them no stars if i could.</text>

<review>I have doing business with Powersports of Vallejo for the past 8 years and can't say enough good things.  Beau and the rest of the guys are a pleasure to work with and will always work to give you a good deal for honest service.  When the time came,  I bought a new Suzuki from Mike to replace my KLR650, and he helped me compare and contrast the bikes in order to make an informed decision.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I only trust my bike with the guys at Vallejo Powersports.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1487120443807, 'text': 'Thank you Victoria, we appreciate the kind word and for being our customer for the last eight years.

< Review>
I have bought my share of toys from these cats..a 2007 Gixxer 750 brand new, a 2016 Suzuki DR-Z 400 E brand new, a 2016 Polaris Sportsman XP-1000 &  a 2016 Polaris Sportsman 850...both brand new.  A 2015 Kymco Like 200 I brand new. I bought a butt load of OEM parts here too. Must be honest about the parts purchasing....you will pay extra for the parts from these guys. Save $$$ by buying online.  Still...like the owner...good guy.  Clean store.</Review>

Came in to pick up a pair of fork seals and dust caps with them. Walked in and wasn't talked to for a solid 20 minutes. I was looked at by staff but they continued talking on the phone, no "hey give me a minute I'll be with you" personally no big deal to me but if you run a store you got to acknowledge customers waiting for service. Anyways I grab my stuff leave and go to my mechanic the next day, the guys there ended up giving me the correct fork seals but instead dust caps they gave me som fork seals to someother bike. Whatever I just re used the old dust caps, no big deal. But I had to go out of my way to go back here to be met with attitude when I said I was given fork seals to another bike when I was supposed to get dust caps. Refund was done with attitude and I went on my way. I'm an overall chill guy things like that will never bother me but I know some people would get pissed off by that. So if you're one of those people I wouldn't go here, an also I don't think I'll be doing any business here either.< /Text>

Was looking for a Ninja 300 and saw a Craigslist ad that showed one "on sale" at this dealership. The sale price was $4199 for a 2014 Ninja 300 SE (a year old model mind you). Somehow after getting a quote that price skyrocketed to $5600. Apparently any lower would've lost them money, although the Yamaha R3 has something like a $500 profit already built-in to the MSRP so I'm assuming the Ninja 300 is similar with Kawasaki. Contra Costa Powersports in Pleasant Hill was able to match this so-called "sale price" with a brand new 2015 SE Ninja 300, which has an MSRP of $5200. Obviously I went the route of getting the 2015 considering I didn't have any ridiculous fees tacked on. Payed MSRP and sales tax at Contra Costa and that was it. Listing a bike as on sale and then tacking on $1400 worth of fees is a little crazy, especially for a 2014 model. I would advise anyone to go to Contra Costa Powersports in Pleasant Hill, it's only a little bit further away and they'll most likely give you a better deal than this dealership. If you're looking for a Ninja 300 specifically and want to pay way too much then you should go here, otherwise look at the 2015 models at Contra Costa and get a year newer model for the exact same price as this dealerships "sale price" for a 2014.<//text>

< Review>
I have a 96 Polaris sl PWC. I have gone to this shop several times, and even though the ski is out of date and Polaris doesn't even produce watercraft anymore, they have always gone above and beyond to try and find what im looking for. And im usually looking for nickel and dime stuff. customer service is absolutely stellar. I am also not a mechanic, and they have always given clear, concise instructions and hints on how to install or change out a part with out being condescending. Parts department rocks.< /Review>

Just passed my driving test today and I can’t say I could have done it without the help of Javier. Extremely thorough with instructions and made sure I was more than ready for my test. Always on time and felt safe throughout the lessons. Would definitely recommend.<//Text>

This is very good driving school. I have only taken 2 classes so far but I have learned a lot in these classes. The instructors are very patient and put me at ease, making driving less stressful and fun. When i make mistakes the instructor calmly tells explains to me what i did wrong and corrects me. I would highly recommend this school.

Update: I took my driving test today and passed!!!< /review>

I was instructed by Yancarlos.
I passed my test this past Friday. Thanks to Rivadavia school, and specially thanks to Yancarlos who was so patient and resourceful.

The cars that are used for the lessons are optimal, clean and well maintained. Overall it was a great experience and I'll recommend it 100%< /review>

<Review>I took one regular lesson and then did the DMV behind-the-wheel test package. For both sessions Yancarlos was super knowledgeable, professional, and helpful.
My experience for the DMV test was smooth – I got a two hour lesson before and a quality, insured, vehicle for the test. I passed!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I had quite a few lessons with Yan Carlos and passed my driving test first try. Learning with Yan Carlos is like learning with a friend who knows the traffic laws well, in the sense that it is very low stress. Yan Carlos is also very alert and was able to iron out the mistakes I was making, especially in my earlier lessons.

Booking and organising the lessons was great and I would definitely recommend taking lessons from this school if you're trying to learn!< /Text>< response>

<review>Yan Carlos was always punctual, and very methodical in his instruction to ensure that as a first time driver I knew all the rules of the road and actions to be a defensive/safe driver. Unlike most instructors he also gave highway practice lessons which built up my driving confidence. 10/10 would recommend!< /review></record></dataset><record>

YanCarlos is an amazing teacher! He have great patience and a nice way to communicate with their student. You will feel confident if you take classes with him, I had a trauma in a car accident a few year ago, and that's why I didn't want to learn how to drive. However, YanCarlos made me feel so confident and secure about myself and driving. That's how I was able to pass my driving test on Tuesday (02/02) and got only two mistake. I recommend YanCarlos 100% he is so friendly 👌</text>

I had a fantastic experience with Emilio at Rivadavia Driving School. As an instructor, he always made me feel safe, thoroughly explained the reasons for each skill we worked on during our lessons, tailored our sessions to what I felt I needed to practice most, and was very flexible and accommodated my schedule. I also had so much fun during our lessons, and I'll miss our great conversations in Spanish. His assistant Lily is a pleasure to work with, too!

I could not recommend Emilio and Rivadavia Driving School more highly, and I've even suggested their services to family members looking to improve their driving skills. Their online booking system makes scheduling lessons quick and easy, and they are operating with extra health and safety precautions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tl;dr: Great instruction, scheduling, safety, and customer service. If you're looking to become a more confident driver, this is the place to call!

Also, I passed my test after our lessons!< /review>

<review>Emilio is an excellent teacher because he really is that person who guides you in the best way in learning.  He is a patient person, extremely careful with the indications he gives you and knows how to clearly explain each of the steps to be followed to be a good driver.  Needless to say, he is an excellent person, very kind and friendly.  One thing to highlight about Emilio is that he teaches you the why and how of things.  When I first arrived with Emilio, I had no idea how to take a turn, he very carefully step by step was explained to me, taught me to see the blind spot always and to control the speed and taught me to drive defensively always wait for it  unexpected is the best intrutro I recommend it with Emilio is 100% sure that they will turn on and pass the driving test many thanks Emilio</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Rivadavia Driving School is by far the best driving school I've experienced. Emilio is extremely patient with his students, humorous, and absolutely positive in general. He provides vivid instructions, and he will guide you through each process one step at a time. Emilio taught me many tips from the start. You will learn a lot from him. He cares about his students, and most importantly, safety. He will not only teach you how to drive, but how to become a safe and professional driver. I highly recommend this school anyone wanting to learn how to drive!</text>

Great driving school! I had a great experience with them. I just moved to San Francisco from Europe and I had a drivers licence before but was required to pass the test again here. This school is not the cheapest but they certainly deliver quality. Their availability and online booking system are great. I had a 2 hour driving lesson and also booked the exam with them as I did not have access to another car. Macarena is a great instructor and super friendly! I passed the exam last Friday without any problems. I definitely recommend!< /Review>

Thank you Emilio for being such a good person, for teaching and for giving me confidence that I could drive over San Fran hills.
I loved the car, it's easy to drive and thanks to dual control safe too. And there always treats waiting on the back seat.
By the way I passed behind the wheel exam from the first try, all because Emilio waked up my driving instincts in a pretty much short period of time. So it was really piece of cake!<//review>

<Review>Emilio is the best instructor! I learned great defensive driving techniques with him and feel much more confident as a driver. As a foreign national trying to get a California driver’s license, the classes with Emilio were crucial to get me ready and learn all the rules. I passed my exam and will take everything I learned to be a better driver! Thanks Emilio, it was such a pleasure learning from you!< /Review>< user_name>

<review>I had the most wonderful experience with Rivadavia Driving School, particularly with Emilio Guerrero. Emilio is an experienced driving instructor who is warm, kind, and funny. Above all, he trusts his students and doesn't get angry or nervous. There is no one better than Emilio to put a student driver at ease. I strongly recommend Rivadavia!< /review>< Rate>

I did 3 driving lessons with Emilio and he is amazing. Driving through busy street corners, turning into two way streets from one way streets, and knowing who has the right of way on a four way intersection can be a little more tricky than you think! Especially when driving in the city. Not only is Emilio great at teaching the rules of the road, but he also makes an effort to explain the logic behind each rule. He is  responsible, funny, always on time and has years of driving experience to share with you all!<//Review>

Had a great time perfecting my driving with Emilio. Classy, smart, relaxed, he will tell you not what you want to hear, but what you NEED to hear before taking your driving test. I took a few refresher lessons before passing my driving test at Daly City. Flawless execution. Emilio teaches you not only rules of the road and good driving habits, but also how to be relaxed, casual, and predictable on the road. Highly recommend! Seems costly but well worth the investment.<//text>

<text>Emilio is a great instructor! I had several lessons with him, he was always on time, patient and funny. He shared with me years of knowledge and experience to help me become a safe driver and pass my driving test without breaking a sweat.

Just got my very first driver license TODAY! That was my first test and I nailed it with only 2 minors!! I was so surprised that I did such a good job but to really think about it, it was all because of Emilio's wonderful teaching that made this test so easy. A plus about his driving class is he not only teaches me how to pass the drive test, which is fairly basic, but he showed me all the "magic" that helped me develop this defensive driving habit. I had 13-15 classes each of which consisted of 2 hours approximately, and before this I have never touched a wheel! I'm planning on taking 3 more lessons to enhance on driving on freeway, which was not required in the test, on parking and on driving in heavy traffic. I couldn't more appreciative to have found this awesome gentleman and really worked hard to earn this license. After all, driving is more than just to get pass a test. It should always be about your own safety, other drivers' and pedestrians' as well. Strongly recommended.<//review>

I was a complete afraid beginner with no driving experience when I decided to take classes at Rivadavia School. This week I finished my classes and passed the driving test :)
Emilio is the type of teacher you'll always remember. He is patient, he will trust you and make you feel confident. I'd recommend the school to everyone that would not only want to pass the test but really want to learn how to drive safely.</Review>

<review>I am so happy to have found this driving school! I've taken lessons with both Macarena and Emilio and they're both fantastic instructors, although in different ways. Emilio was the perfect teacher for my first lessons, making me feel safe behind the wheel and telling a bunch of jokes to make me feel less nervous (I was terrified to start driving). I then quickly started thinking that driving can actually be fun. Macarena, on the other hand, is great at challenging you and giving you a lot of supervised freedom to develop confidence in your own abilities. She takes minimum control of the pedals and rather gives you a lot of guidance with her voice to help you drive safely, but on your own. She has a great aura around her and somehow she is always making you feel calm and collected (even though learning to change lanes around other cars can be really stressful!). I really enjoyed all my lessons, passed the driving test at first try and would therefore recommend this school to anyone!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I passed the driving test at San Francisco DMV on my first attempt having taken lessons with Emilio and Macarena.   They didn't only prepare me for the behind-the-wheel test, but also helped me get rid of my fear of driving in the U.S. ( I come from where driving seats are on the right ) and build confidence.  Although I drove a few times with my international license before, I was so unsure about the local traffic rules , which made me nervous.  I realized how much I actually didn't know by learning the local rules and techniques through my lessons with Emilio and Macarena.    I am really happy to have invested  in their lessons.< /Text>

As a new driver, with no driving experience i was very nervous but i was able to learn quickly because of Emilio. He is very patient, calm, cool and collected. And when you make mistakes he is really there to help you improve your driving skills. He is not like other driving instructors who are intimidating and get frustrated when you keep making the same mistakes. he is very accommodating to his students and will work with your schedule, and always arrive on time. I highly recommend Rivadavia Driving school, on your first lesson Emilio does an evaluation  and from there he tells you how many lessons you may need. He will practice with you until you improve and also help practice the driving routes done on the dmv driving test.< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><review>This auto school has Instructors who are personable and patient. For driving lessons I saw a fantastic instructor he is very patient and easy to understand. I also worked with matt who taught me simple steps to learn how to parallel park as when I took the test the first time I unfortunately did not pass because of parallel parking. However I took the test  A 2ND time and I passed. instructor  who does all the scheduling is very accommodating and very patient with you and they work with you around your schedule ect. I would recommend this driving school to anybody who is afraid about driving because they make you feel comfortable and it was an overall great experience.<//review>< pics>

They were patient and helped me build my confidence until I became a good defensive driver who actually enjoys it and passed the test the first time out.

I heard other students talk about schools that didn't really teach them much. Rivadavia will teach you safe-driving skills with an emphasis on what you need to pass the test as well as building the instincts to make you a good defensive driver.</text>< pics>

<Review>I have to say that I do not have a talent for driving and gets really nervous during tests (probably the worst combination)... Thanks god that the instructor Emilio and his daughter (who also taught me a few times) are very patient with me. They always encourage me and remind me of the do's and don'ts of driving, countless times over (mostly because I forget them really fast...).

After quite a few weekends of practice and 3 driving tests, I finally passed my driving test! Thank you Emilio!

Tips for real newbie driver: If you do not want to take your test in hilly San Francisco or Daily City, San Mateo is a good alternative. It is flat, making maintaining speed so much easier. It also have much fewer cyclists than SF DMV area, meaning less things to worry about during the test. Just tell your instructor your preference and they can even help you book the test there.< /Review>< pictures>

Thanks to Emilio and Macarena, my husband and I were both able to pass our driving tests on our first try!

I would definitely recommend both instructors.  They are very professional, punctual and patient.  I personally took classes with both of them and I am very satisfied with everything I learned, I feel so much more confident on the road.  I took a total of five classes with them and I was able to master my turns, get on the freeway and learn defensive driving techniques.

At first I was a little hesitant because of the money, but I can without a doubt say it was one of the best investments I have made.  I even ended up taking more classes than I had planned because I was so satisfied with my results.  Driving with them does not compare to driving with friends or family because 1.  they have their own pedals (which made me safer), 2.  know what DMV examiners are looking for  3.  aren't paranoid to be in a car with you (like my mom, lol)--they are calming and reassuring.

One more thing...I think hiring them for my actual test (they give you a two-hour class before the test and then you use their car for your test) was a great choice.  They are familiar with the DMV, they take you directly to the test line and take care of showing the required paperwork and help set you up.  One less thing to worry about and allowed me to focus on my exam!

Thank you Emilio and Macarena!  You both are awesome!<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I'm a 26-year old transplanted New Yorker and was starting to fear that I'd never learn to drive, but I'm happy to say I just passed my driving test (at the San Francisco DMV, no less!) thanks to Emilio Guerrero and the Rivadavia Driving School!

Emilio and his daughter are great instructors, even though their styles are a little different (in case one works better for you). They are both very kind, knowledgeable and easy-going (and are both at least bilingual in Spanish and English)-and maybe even trilingual, as I believe Emilio's daughter also knows Portuguese...). Emilio is very funny and charming- like the good-natured Chilean uncle you always wish you had; his daughter is very warm and calm, but serious about her work. I took almost all of my lessons with Emilio and we talked and joked a lot in Spanish (because it made me feel more relaxed- Emilio is first and foremost a professional; his priority is getting you to become a good, defensive driver- not to talk your ear off). As an added plus, my Spanish has noticeably improved since taking lessons with Emilio! (Especially my knowledge of idioms).

Some of the best parts of the Rivadavia experience:
-The day of your first lesson, your instructor will have you drive so that he/she can assess your skills and figure out how many lessons you'll need to pass the test (good for budgeting your money and time!)
-Your instructor will have you practice in different testing locations, so you can figure out which DMV is best for your test.
-The testing cars are LUXURY AUTOMOBILES- the new Acura was my favorite ;) - and they are always stocked with water and snacks (2 hour lessons can be tiring).
-The instructors are SO KIND- after I passed the test, Emilio took me and my friends out to celebrate! ¡Qué caballero!<//text>< pics>

I definitely recommend Rivadavia. I took several lessons from Yancarlos and passed the driving test in my first try. Passing the test was not the only goal though. I also learned a lot about defense driving. I would definitely recommend him. Also, their cars great for the learning to drive. They are very new, clean and easy to drive.< /review>

<user_id>116832476602603681212<//user_id><review>(Translated by Google) Emilio is an excellent teacher because he really is that person who guides you in the best way in learning. He is a patient person, extremely careful with the indications he gives you and knows how to clearly explain each of the steps to be followed to be a good driver. Needless to say, he is an excellent person, very kind and friendly. One thing to highlight about Emilio is that he teaches you the why and how of things. When I first arrived with Emilio, I had no idea how to take a turn, he very carefully step by step I was explained how to do it until I learned it. Without hesitation, I would choose Emilio as a professor once again. For me it was very comfortable and useful to be able to speak with him in Spanish. Thanks Emilio

(Original)
Emilio es un excelente profesor porque realmente es esa persona que te guía de la mejor forma en el aprendizaje. Es una persona paciente, extremadamente cuidadoso con las indicaciones que te da y sabe explicarte claramente cada una de los pasos a seguir para ser un buen conductor. Sobra decir que es una excelente persona , muy amable y simpático. Una cosa a resaltar de Emilio es que él te enseña el por qué y cómo de las cosas. Cuando yo llegue por primera vez con Emilio, no tenía ni idea cómo dar una vuelta, él muy cuidadosamente paso a paso me fue explicado cómo hacerlo  hasta que lo aprendí. Sin dudar a duda, elegiría a Emilio como profesor una vez mas. Para mi fue muy  cómodo y útil poder hablar con él en español.

<Review>This was my wife’s first time seeing this doctor,  and I was kind of nervous cause I get more nervous when my wife or daughters are being examined more than myself.   The lady at the front desk,  was very helpful and informative,  and had the answers to all our questions.   His medical assistent was also informative and understanding of our concerns.   The doctor came in and kept the situation loose and comfortable by saying a few things that made us laugh.   And before he even examined her he was most interested to get a brief summary of my wife’s medical history,  and as he was asking about her medical history he asked about our family and even commented on what we had to say to him about our family,  which made us even more comfortable.   So we want to thank the doctor and his staff for easing us into the examination and for taking the time to find out a little about us and our family.   We appreciated your professionalism and kindness.</Review>< Pictures>

She made sure I understood the condition, and did not leave the room until all my questions were answered. She walked me out of the room to the front lobby and gave me her business card, stating call or come back if I had questions or concerns.< /Review>

<Text>The office ladies went above and beyond what is expected from them.  Without their help I would not have been able to see the surgeon.  He was also very nice.  He was thorough with his examination and explained everything to me.  I would highly recommend Crown Surgery!< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
From my first call to make appointment until today, the staff has been wonderful. I was able to get appointment scheduled within a few days, Jeanette handles the front office, she's so attentive. She got me all the forms beforehand,  so I could fill them out at home. Answered all my questions and confirmed  my appointment over the weekend.  Wow. The office is very safe, have taken every precaution to minimize all Covid risks.
Dr. Pollark is amazing. He made me feel that he takes my reasoning for seeing him, as serious as I do. Gave me the time I needed, no rushing. Very professional but also "human" and kind. His assistant is also super kind, and patient.
My overall is this is how a doctor and his staff should be. Im so happy I was referred to them and feel my health is now is proper hands.
Thank you so much .<//Review>

1000 on a scale of 1-10 everyone was amazingly sweet. I was so nervous today. I was scared and so many other scary emotions and your staff were complete angels. They made me laugh kept me feeling at ease up until I fell asleep and when I woke up crying in pain they were so patient and gentle with me. Thank you so much. Laura is a God send. Lisa is a complete ball of joy and my anesthesiologists sadly I can't remember his name but he is hilarious! And Jay was there also a friendly familiar face who did my Covid testing! He was amazing Monday and i was so happy to see him today! Your facility really knew my uneasiness and made it all for the better. Please thank them all. Thank you so much! When it’s time for my long over due mommy make over I hope they are the team helping lol thank you all.<//text>

<Review>Dr. Cross repaired a surgery from last year. I was in no hurry to have it redone due to the extreme pain from the first time. This time the recovery was not bad at all, and my faux baby bump is finally gone!
Dr Cross helped me to get ready for some life saving treatment, as well. After that , he performed another surgery no woman looks forward to.
He is truly amazing at what he does. I would recommend him to  anyone who wants the best surgeon to take care of their issues.</Review>< resp>

I go to their office in Corona CA..ALL the ladies in the office, in their different areas, are very professional, respectful, and always willing to help with a smile on their face! This is so important, especially when one is facing an upcoming surgery...kudos to all! Also very important to mention is that Dr. Cross, my surgeon, is a superb doctor who has an immense medical knowledge and a wonderful bed-side manner...after my recent surgery, he went to check on me every day at the hospital, including over the weekend...it meant a lot to me and my husband! Thank you Dr. Cross and the staff at Crown Surgery-Corona, CA< /review>

For years Kaiser said I had food algeries. Never ran a test. I switched insurance, Dr Cross ran CT and MRI and found my problem as being a tumor in my stomach. I am on my road to recovery.

I can not say enough about Crown Surgery Medical, Dr. Stephen Dada and the entire staff.  They have been thorough, professional and caring.  I have received the best possible care, pre-op, during surgery and post-op.< /review>

Great, fast & affordable. I was skeptical at first because it's not a fancy place. However Felix did a great job. Wish I had tried this place earlier. Nice haircut at an affordable rate. I totally recommend.< /text>

<Text>Clean, well lit facility.  Staff very helpful and responsive.  Would use again.  My only suggestion is to have more carts available for moving items since storage units aren't all on ground floor.   You may need to wait during busy times for a cart to move items.< /Text>< rating>

<Text>Clean, secure, and well managed. As a business owner concerned about Northern California wildfires I didn't want to take a risk with our inventory and this placed fit our needs perfectly. I had no doubt our materials would remain secure in this place and was not disappointed. The staff is professional and competent. Highly recommended.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1616992263548, 'text': 'Hi Noah , Thanks so much for your review!

<Text>The best facility in SOCO! I have had a unit here for 3 years and will never rent anywhere else. The facility is spotless and secure- no sign of pests (not even a single spiderweb).  The staff is courteous and goes out of their way to ensure you are a happy customer.  I recently was looking to move into a larger unit and was delighted when the staff worked their magic to secure a unit right around the corner from my current one.  Moving was a snap due to this simple consideration they made for me.  That's what makes this place the best- outstanding customer service and an impeccable attention to detail.  Do yourself and your belongings a favor and put them here!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Cathy was super helpful today! Although Her computers were not cooperating and I was in no rush, she reassured me I was not forgotten. Really good at acknowledging other storage members and extremely efficient at multitasking. Very pleased at the service I received today. Thank You Cathy!!!<//review>

Cathy was always so helpful, kind, and professional!  The whole place is kept clean and secure.  We never had any problems and the whole time we were there, many years, was smooth and pleasant.  If/when we need storage again in the future, this is where we will come, best storage facility, hands down!!!  Thank you!!!<//text>

Found this place on Google. Drove there the next day and rented a unit. Staff was super friendly and took the time to show me the unit, go over all the nuances of the facility, and had me signed up and finalized in no time at all. Highly recommend this Storage Pro facility.</Review>

Small unit, expensive but clean, feels safe and close to home. Could use a handicap accessible but none were available. Hope they call if one opens up!< /review>

Wonderful newish storage building, spotlessly clean, extremely well managed with air conditioning, an elevator, moving carts, and friendly staff!  Can't say enough about it -- it's a great place to keep your  stuff.</Text>

<review>The main lady that runs it is very nice. Also, there is a bathroom on site which is maintained like new. Also, I have never been to a storage yard with this much security and she insured me that they get regular pest control to avoid rodents on site. I have had storage units in other places where rodents chewed through almost everything I had, even though I didn't pack any food or beverages. This place is so CLEAN! It's worth the money because your stuff is really protected! Plus, they have giant dollies you can use to help you get your stuff into your unit. Those came in handy!</review>< Pictures>

I recently needed to rent a storage unit for just a couple of months to store things while doing some reorganization. I found StoragePRO to be clean, close to where I live, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I had never had storage in a multi-level building, but I found it very convenient to use - there is a large elevator, and they have large moving carts available. Excellent experience - kudos to Bob, the manager.</review>

The manager was very kind and would often make sure things were going well.  I would recommend this place to anybody looking for short or long term storage.  Like most places, understand that you need to be strategic around move out dates (as to not pay a full month and move out mid-month), but that seems standard in any rental place.

We downsized to move to Santa Rosa, but I am able to keep family treasures/books/records that I no longer have room for in our apartment.

StoragePro is clean, temperature-controlled and easily accessible.  I probably stop by at least once a month  to pick up or drop off items that are important to me.  The staff have been very helpful [esp. when I forget my code!]

So glad it is nearby [i.e. not on 101].<//review>< pictures>

If you are looking for a down to earth yet professional company and secure for your belongings - You found it, no joke. Being in customer service and acting it out on a daily for almost 14yrs now (I started young) they have it...If you ever need the definition of great customer service stop by any location RP or SR. They are truly helpful especially in a bind, my boyfreind and I needed the smallest unit possible and ASAP which in the summer time with Graduations and move ins and outs it seemed impossible yet these guys made it possible and the best decision out of the five other companies surrounding that we called and spoke with them. Price wise they are even reasonable and to most thats all they want...Thank you again StoragePro we will always use your company if possible and will forever recommend it! Im blanking out on your managers names but on site at SR location he is great and made a very stressful day we were having just go away. THANK YOU!!<//text>

Visited this store for the first time.
Great friendly customer service
Also I like the fact that it's a long time family owned business. We will definitely be back to compete our purchase.< /review>

<text>I love this place. the staff are great about letting you be on your own. My only issues is the sticker shock. I am sure it is all worth it, but way outside the price range we were looking at. A girl can dream - right?</text>< Pics>

<Review>My husband came in about 10 minutes ago and was looking for a part for our BBQ pit and the sales person was so rude. My husband asked for help and showed him the part but before he could ask about it the sales person immediately said "no. And I don't know where to find it." And walked off. Didn't even let my husband speak or ask or anything. What kind of customer service is that? Won't ever walk into that store again. Maybe because we are Mexican not sure. So disappointed.<//Review>< date>

<text>Terrible Customer Service.  We bought patio furniture from them many years ago when they had a different name, and we both recalled a nasty, nonchalant, rude attitude back then.  However, the prices were right and the furniture has stood the test of time...  Until recently, when the table umbrella began coming off the corners.  I called and spoke with Tom, who, just as before, had a rude attitude; as though he were doing me a favor.  He asked me to email him photos of the umbrella in order to determine my needs, and said he'd reply with a recommendation and price quote.  I did so.  No response.  I re-emailed them the following day, asking to confirm receipt.  No response for several days, so I called back, and he had apparently forgotten all about it.  He pulled up the photos, asked for measurements and told me he'd call me the next day with a price quote.  Next day rolls around and no call.  So I called again; was told "he is out today."  Tried to get quote from person who answered (Mike?), but the initially friendly voice turned immediately short and rude.  Was told Tom would "get back to you tomorrow."  Of course, that didn't happen.  Tried again and phone rings and rings with no answer. Somehow these people haven't figured out they'd have much happier customers if they met their customers even halfway, responding to courtesy in kind.  Will take my business elsewhere.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>The WORST experience I've ever had with a merchant in my entire life. DO NOT bring these guys your business! Unprofessional, lazy, and rude.

I paid $2,300 for a fire pit at the beginning of the summer (early May). Tom, Mike, and Mike assured me that it would arrive within 6 weeks at the latest. Week 7 was when I began calling for updates. Every time I called they responded with, "I will get in touch with the supplier and give you a call back in 90 minutes." Seemed fair enough but I didn't receive a call back. Week 8 I call again and get the same response and they are short/rude (again). NO CALL BACK. Week 9 I got the same response a third time and told them I've heard that 3 times and they continued to be short and rude on the phone. They are sitting there watching the giants game doing absolutely nothing all day, the least they could do is call me back and be polite about delaying a $2300 order close to a month.

Finally they called back (after the 3rd call a day later not 90 minutes like they said again) and said it was on back order and that's all they could tell me. No approximate delivery etc... nothing. I was frustrated but figured I'd waited long enough and maybe they would do something to figure this out.

10 weeks after giving them $2300 and getting zero useful information out of them, I was forced to call and ask for a refund. At this point, Tom actually made a call and found out that they could delivery in six more weeks. I cancelled my order and I will not be going back.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Bought a custom BBQ, delivered a month late and when they finally delivered, it was dropped off completely unassembled and had paint all over the countertop tiles, also had to cut a 2” metal bar to install the grill. Avoid Tom at all costs, very nonchalant about trying to resolve issues. DO NOT BUY A CUSTOM BBQ FROM THESE GUYS!!</Review>

I went in to buy a $3000 smoker from them and have it delivered. They told me they couldn't deliver until next week for some reason. I was fine with that. This week I get a call Monday saying they will deliver it Friday. I asked if they could do it Wed because I wouldn't be home Friday. He said he'd check and call me back. He never called me back so I called him Wed morning to follow up. he said it wasn't possible because they had 2 other deliveries but he would try and get it out to me on Thursday, again he said he'd call me back. He didn't call me back. I called again Thursday to find out if he was going to be able to deliver it and he said he didn't think so, but he'll call me back if he can get it over to me today (Thursday). The smoker didn't come and again no phone call. I call him again this morning (Friday) and asked if the smoker was out for delivery today. He then asks me "what day is good for you for delivery?" I was dumbfounded. I've been chasing after him for a week trying to get this scheduled and now after me having to call him for the 3rd time because he never returned my call any of the times he said he would he acted like this was our 1st conversation. I told him, "Okay, if we're going to continue to play games then refund my money". He promptly said "sure, what's your card number", no apology or anything. I told him "that is not any way to run a business. You don't treat customers like that". He then tries to lecture me on how "when someone asks you what day is good for you..." I didn't wait around to let him finish lecturing me as if I'm his employee. I cut him off and told him "how dare you lecture me. I was your customer, you don't lecture me on communication. I paid you, not the other way around." He promptly then hung up on me. I plan to also contact the Yoder Smoker company to let them know how one of their dealers is treating their customers.< /Text>

My dad was going to buy a bbq from these guys, but the sales guy was rude to me, so we decided to buy the bbq on amazon instead. We're big into buying from brick and mortar establishments, big into helping out local businesses, but this business was not worth supporting.< /review>< name>

I came in on a Sunday afternoon. A gentlemen. Tom I believe helped me out and we talked a bit while paying. He offered me some a discount price on a new wood he got in. I also talked a bit about his smoker options. He has yoders for days. In every size. As well as traegers. THE coolest things there are the pizza ovens. But after I left I took a look at the reviews, i saw the PETA 1 and another guy complaining about someone making a comment about there shirt. It was hilarious and I will return. Because good customer service on a request for a cheap glove which turned out great. and the options there are the best. From small pellet smokers to smokers that run into the 10k range that are ment for commercial purposes.

Idk much about the furniture but about 3/5ths of the store was furniture and furniture accessories<//text>

Bought a lovely looking patio set, with 3 months the wicket is sagging and cushions have faded. They are selling as outdoor furniture with Sunbrella type fabrics. Having had there products this is not what they are selling. Poor customer service all I am told with the sagging is remove the glass top to the table which by the way it came with so it stays cooler or keep an umbrella up. Well we do keep an umbrella up but you can not use the table if there is no glass. What a joke.

I will be making a formal complaint to the BBB and my local news station if I do not receive an adequate fix.< /Text>< Resp>

My wife, daughter and I were met with a smile from Sargon and right away I wanted to jump in to the Tundra that we came to see. The process was easy. No pressure to buy. We were given our options. My only reason not to give a 5 star was that I had an appointment time and there was nobody in the lobby to check in. But other than that. Thank you Merced Toyota for my very first Truck that I have bought in the 30+ years I have been driving.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Went car shopping for a new car for myself knowing pretty much what i want and Stephen came up and asked if i needed any help. He showed me the car i wanted and told me all the features about it And let me test drive it and i was officially sold on the car. The buying process was just as smooth as the shopping process. I couldn’t of asked for an easier car shopping/buying experience. Will definitely be returning for my next car i buy in the future and highly recommend Merced Toyota to anyone looking for a car!<//text>

<Review>I was still 400 miles from home when my hybrid began flashing all sorts of warning messages on the dash and making funny noises under the hood.  How inconvenient and worrisome.  It was by good luck that I googled and found Merced Toyota only 4 1/2 miles away.  Initially contacting their after hours chat, there was no available appointment for a week.  I did call their service department when it opened and was relieved to be offered some great solutions with the service advisor, JR.  He was super helpful in explaining options, potential cost and timeline for repair.  This coupled with the assistance of their rental agent, Erin, I was back on the road and headed home within 2 hours.  Car problems are always so inconvenient but I appreciate the urgency and professionalism with which the staff at Merced Toyota extended to this stranded motorist to get me back home safe and sound.
To date, communication on their part was great throughout, my car has been repaired and running perfectly.  I highly recommend this service department and would take my vehicle there for any future maintenance or repairs!<//Review>< Pictures>

Always love going to Merced Toyota. If you want a great deal talk with Ramsin. He is one of the managers there and works the desk. He is a great person and will always do his best to help.</Text>

< Review>
First time buying a car. A lot of my friend recommended Merced Toyota! They are the best according to them. I went didn't think twice. Went in Saturday afternoon and I choose the Truck I wanted. He ran my credit and told me that they were struggling to get ahold of the banks because it was late. I understood, he told me that he would keep me posted. Sunday came didn't here from them until 1:00 pm. He sent me a text message stating that they were still working on it. That's the last time I heard from them. Monday, came I messaged him to see if there was any new updates and he said no nothing yet. I kept messaging and messaging and no response on Monday until 3:00 pm. I felt like I was bothering them. He then replied back and said the same thing again. At this point I  was over it. I don't understand why they couldn't just call back and let me know what was going on. I called Modesto Toyota, told them what was going on. They didn't understand why they were doing that. so, I went  to the Toyota dealership in Modesto and the experience I had there was amazing. They treated me very well. I left driving a new truck that same day. I still haven't heard from them...<//Review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>This is regarding the service department. I went here for a 5,000 mile service (tire rotation, various checks and inspections). They checked me in relatively quickly, then hit me with the bad news: We estimate it will take about an hour and forty-five minutes. An hour and forty-five minutes?!? I had an appointment and arrived on time. How can it take that long for a minimal service like this, especially with an appointment?

The good news is they finished up in about 55 minutes. That's longer than I'd like, but not as outrageous as 1:45.< /Text><user_name>Richard Townsend< /user_name><userid>107606048332835227502< /userid>< pics>

I've gotten the majority of my car services done here and every single time, it's a positive experience. 100% recommend. They always make sure everything's checked out on my car, and in the times that I've waited in-store for my car service to be completed, they offered me snacks and drinks. (They also have comfortable couches you can sit on while you wait.) Staff is very polite and accommodating. I have no complaints. I appreciate you, Merced Toyota.<//Review>

My experience at Mercede Toyota  doesn't  deviate. They are courtesy, attentive and get your vehicle back to you as promised.  Keep you informed as to the progress of the work being performed. I actually believe they try to go the extra mile when at all possible. I would not trust any other place with my vehicle. I would recommend Mercede Toyota in a heartbeat...</text>

<Review>We brought our 2015 Toyota sienna in for a noise under the hood,  our service advisor  Eric  was very helpful.  Come to find out it was the water pump. It was still cover under warranty. Eric kept in touch with me about the status of our van. Very satisfied about the service and work that Eric and the technician performed on my vehicle.  I will recommend Merced Toyota to anyone who needs service to their vehicle. 👍</Review></record></dataset><record>

Do not come here for service! I dropped my car off at approximately 10:50 am. I was told that should receive a call when my car is ready to pick up. I didn’t receive a call until 4:45pm. The service center closes at 5pm. When I showed up to Toyota 30 minutes after which is a reasonable response time to show up after a call. I was told that service is closed and I wouldn’t be able to get my keys. I was extremely FURIOUS who calls someone 15 minutes before they close to come get pick up their car? With no shuttle available I had to arrange some time out of my friends day to drop me off at the dealership. The WORST PART was the staff constantly making me feel like it was my fault for showing up late. When it wasn’t my fault at all. Extremely unacceptable behavior, if you give someone 15 minutes to call for a ride plus the drive to the dealership along with signing papers, i’m not a superhero I can’t just fly there. As someone who strives for good business ethics, this place made me feel unwelcomed. I’m young and work hard to help run a buissness. Id appreciate if my time is valued like anyone else older than me. 7pm rolls by and they were able to get the manager from service to come grab my keys for me. So thank you again for the manager that was able to help but it’s really sad to grow up around a brand that help save my life once in an accident, but to be treated like any less just because the sale has been made.<//text>

<text>I brought my vehicle to get service due to a recall. My appointment time was at 8:40am. I was told that estimated service time was 3hours & that there was no shuttle available to drop me off. Hence, on the other side I see the Honda dealership providing shuttle services for their customers 🤔🤔🤔🤔. Therefore, I called a family member to pick me up. Went home & waited patiently. 12pm rolls around & still no communication from Toyota. I then called Toyota approximately 12:20pm to check up on my vehicle & spoke with an associate from the service department. He then said that it’ll probably take another 20minutes. Less than a minute later, the same associate calls me back to confirm that indeed, there will be another 20minute wait. At approximately 12:50pm I got a call from “KP” & he said it’ll be another 15minutes due to paperwork . SMH !!!! In total, the service time was 4hrs, 1hr beyond the estimated time. Bottom line, poor service, extremely long wait time & poor communication from Toyota. I hope there will never be recall again because I don’t plan on  taking my vehicle to get service there again.<//text><Date>1593729546107<//Date><Rate>2<//Rate>< Pics>

They close at 5:00 p.m. It doesn't matter that the door, the website, and Google maps says they closes at 6:00. They close at 5:00, go pound sand.<//Review>

I brought my vehicle to get service due to a recall. My appointment time was at 8:40am. I was told that estimated service time was 3hours & that there was no shuttle available to drop me off. Hence, on the other side I see the Honda dealership providing shuttle services for their customers 🤔🤔🤔🤔. Therefore, I called a family member to pick me up. Went home & waited patiently. 12pm rolls around & still no communication from Toyota. I then called Toyota approximately 12:20pm to check up on my vehicle & spoke with an associate from the service department. He then said that it’ll probably take another 20minutes. Less than a minute later, the same associate calls me back to confirm that indeed, there will be another 20minute wait. At approximately 12:50pm I got a call from “KP” & he said it’ll be another 15minutes due to paperwork . SMH !!!! In total, the service time was 4hrs, 1hr beyond the estimated time. Bottom line, poor service, extremely long wait time & poor communication from Toyota. I hope there will never be recall again because I don’t plan on  taking my vehicle to get service there again.<//Text>

<text>I've been coming here for a couple of years now and the service here is absolutely worth my 40min drive. Their service is beyond excellent. I'm not sure what Alex's job is but every service dealership needs one of him. He greets you right away and guides you then checks up on you throughout your wait. I have never had an issue that they were not willing to address in a professional manner. This place exceeded my expectations! Keep up the great service!😊<//text>< Pics>

I went in on Saturday for my appointment. It turns out I actually had made my appointment for the next Saturday and didn’t realize it. But they took my car in anyway and said they can still do my 20,000 miles service, it just might take a little longer. Well they only had my car for two hours and they were done. Thankful they did my service even though I confused which day I made my appointment for.< /Text>

<Text>Merced Toyota is always there to help.  I could not find my key to unlock my tire locks.  I wanted to buy regular bolts so I would not have to worry about finding my tire lock key.  I took my 4runner in and they removed my tire lock bolts and put a new bolt on each tire for free.  Not to mention there is always drinks while you wait, and my kids loved that they passed out snacks for waiting customers.  Fantastic service!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>As soon as I walked into the dealer Dan greeted me and made me feel welcome. I made an appointment for 2:30 in the afternoon and it went well. I was just doing the routine check on my car and making sure that everything was working properly on my vehicle I did have a recall for the computer and they took care of it updating all my software and ensuring that it complied to the federal guidelines. Also there’s always free coffee, hot chocolate, tea and today they offered me free snacks, so I didn’t have to use a vending machine whatsoever. The staff at Merced Toyota is very friendly and acknowledges each and every customer that walks into the doors, so if you do not have a Toyota this will be a great dealer for you to purchase a vehicle and I would recommend you taking it to Merced  Toyota when you need maintenance or get it serviced! (Btw this was my first time walking into this dealer for servicing).< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1579226068237, 'text': "We couldn't be happier to see that Dan went above and beyond to provide you with a quality experience.

Next time check your vehicle before trying to sell. ***update, we did end up buying a vehicle from Merced Toyota and they were very helpful and apologized for the situation. We got a great deal and they gave my husband free oil changes for a year. So I have changed my review because of the willingness to keep a customer, that shows you do want people's business and wanting to work with them as well. Great job!

Purchased a new truck about 3 months ago using the Costco auto buying program. Overall the experience was “alright”.
Gilbert did great a great job getting me though the door over the phone. Very helpful and informative however I didn’t deal with him we I showed up. My salesman nick was nice and was a good salesman.
Everything was great up until we shook hands on the deal.
Immediately he left and had us wait for the finance guy, which would only be a few minutes. Unfortunately that turned into nearly an hour of sitting by ourselves at the desk.
Another issue that I found out later, was even though we already had our own financing they still had us fill out a credit application. I was told it wasn’t a hard check on my credit and they did that standard with everyone. Well turns out that is a hard credit check, which to be honest isn’t a big deal but I’m mad that he blatantly lied when he said it wouldn’t.
Also, make sure if buying a white vehicle to check for rail dust (iron deposits) I really noticed it a few days after buying thinking it was just dirt, It’s not and it’s a pain to remove. I should have caught that when I was walking around but being caught up with buying a new vehicle it passed by.
They sent me an email asking how my process was, typed up pretty much the same thing as in this review and never got a response back.
They said that the service department would call a week after to discuss setting up the maintenance plan and they never did. I ended calling with a question about my truck and they said a mechanic would call me, he never did.
Talked to my salesman about buying an additional warranty and he never called me back.
I mean overall they did a great job getting me there but I feel that after I made the deal they couldn’t care less. If it wasn’t for Costco I would have bought it from Modesto which I should have done in the first place just because Modesto is more convenient< /text>

While 6 hours from home and not a regular customer of Toyota Merced, Kevin of the service department put me in queue for a diagnostic, diagnosed the problem, and attempted to track down a replacement part for me. He did not charge for the diagnostic. His efforts displayed outstanding customer service and I very much appreciated being treated so well. Kudos to Kevin and Toyota Merced!< /review>

I had to go inside to get someone to help me. THOMAS said they made deals on used vehicles and he would try to help me get the best deal possible during test drive. Tried to make a deal and he said this is no haggle price dealer. Why didnt he just tell me to begin with? Did not even try to earn my business. Told me the car was a trade in but carfax showed car was bought at auction. Very disappointed. This dealer is a joke. Dont fall for the 4 square tactic u lose guaranteed<//Review>< date>

This is a joke right. What car dealer turns away walk in oil changes on Saturday. It's like turning away free money. I dont know any company that turns down easy profits. No dealer on the east coast would ever turn down a walk in oil change. Your not a luxury car dealer. Maybe consider a fast lube lane to  speed up oil changes and  handle walkin's.  This will be the last car we ever purchase from this dealer. Just called Toyota of Modesto they take walk ins on Saturday all day up to 4pm.< /Text>

<Text>Today I paid a visit to the Merced Toyota Dealership. This has been the 3rd time I’ve gone and wasted my time looking at the vehicles for more than 30 minutes, and not a single person came up to me to assist me. Like I said, it’s been my 3rd and final time I go to that dealership.</Text>< date>

I go in there whenever my Camry needs work done, I always go in there to see Rob Hampton. He helps me with anything I need in a very professional and timely manner. He also introduced me to Chris this time. Who was also amazing. I give five stars to both of them. Whenever you go into a mechanic shop of any kind you always wonder if they are being honest. I don't have that problem there. I trust the people that I see there. And I know that they're not going to make anything up, or exaggerate anything that my car may need. They just do what needs to be done and that's it. Once again a special thank you to Rob and Chris. Toyota is recommended by me

I purchased my Toyota Camry from this dealership about 2 years ago, my family and I have been hooked since. We also then purchased a car for my sister when it came time. The service advisor Jennifer gets us in right away and makes sure if we need a shuttle or anything else while getting service we have it no questions asked! She then takes us to the cashier Samara who continues the wonderful service. I am a Toyota Lifer from all the wonderful people at this dealership!< /Review>

< review>
A few years ago, I took my 2011 Toyota Corolla to Merced Toyota because I had to get an oil change and requested tire inspection. I forgot the man who helped me out, but he did more than necessary and made my experience worthwhile. He inspected my tires and said all they needed was air. He also changed my oil and taught me a few things about my car to keep an eye on. Since then, I've kept his advice on hand and cannot find any other Toyota shop that was as outstanding as Merced Toyota.</review>

3 years ago I went to Merced Toyota to look for a car I left with the car I was looking for and left a very happy customer. So when it was time to get another car I knew where I was going to go. I recently bought my second car from there and was treated very professionally by the sales mgr Jorge and by the GM Mike and again left a very happy and satisfied customer. Since buying my first car, I have sent my parents, sister and brother who all have bought a car from there also.

I would recommend Merced Toyota to anyone that is in need of a car. : )<//Text>

Please save your time and go somewhere else. Greg and I had agreement on certain price and we agree that I will come the day after to pick up the car. But nah, other person called me the day after (TWO HOURS BEFORE  appointment time) and said the price has changed. They had lot of time since morning but they chose to notify me that price has changed two hours before appointment. I guess they were discussing on how to give a good reason for a price changed. Unfortunately I can't be fooled. Oh and what did Greg do? Not even an apology. Instead of apologize of sudden price changed, he raised his tone to a customer and said he has right to refuse the deal. I wonder what did I do and what is my right as a customer to get such attitude from a sales person/internet manager? I wonder if they have BASIC MANNER that if you are wrong you should apologize and for being a sales person yet didn't know how to do a customer service. NOPE. Go somewhere else. Rather pay more with people that can respect each other than having deal but worst customer service.<//Review>

<Text>Fairly quick buying process and friendly staff.

I bought a Tundra from Merced Toyota and Greg Renwick was a great help. No pressure and worked to get us what we wanted from another dealer. They picked it up and still had it ready that afternoon. Great customer service and very happy with our truck.
My wife had trouble getting in the truck so I went back and bought some running boards. They showed me where to find a video on how to install. Took less than an hour. Nice discount on them and they look great.
Once again I had great customer service. Thanks Bea or salesperson 247 if I got the name wrong.<//Text>

<Review>The wait is too long even when you have an appointment for an oil change the wait is from one hour to one and a half hours. Too much!
We bought 5 cars there. 1 corolla, 2 camry and 2 tundras. my camry I prefer to take it to another place where the oil change do it in less than 1/2 hr. also in the comments I read that Ramiro gave 5 stars. Not worth Ramiro works there at toyota Merced.
Even though I do not agree with the service. the Toyota brand is my favorite.

The Merced team was very reasonable with the trade and pricing of the vehicle purchase. Gilbert the sales man was honest and professional. I thought the finance department could have put more effort into trying to get me a better finance rate. Other than that, I'm glad I chose Merced Toyota.<//Review>

I have had my car "serviced" but a few times since moving from Modesto. Richard is the only reason I give two stars. He was knowledgable, helpful, went over and beyond to fix the miscommunication and situation that was not created by him. He truly knows what customer service is by communicating what is happening and following through with what he says. Thank you Richard for going over and beyond to give great costumer service!!</text>

<text>My last 2 services were horrible. I was called to pick up my car however when i arrived I did not receive my keys for 40 minutes! Next service after that they never even called me I had to call and checking my car was ready which it had been for a while according to the girl on the phone. Upon arriving I was informed that I needed my air filters replaced and told that they could be done but my car would have to go back into the shop and it would be an additional 85 dollars. I was very upset that I was not called and relayed this information so I could make a decision on the phone and they could complete the work before I arrived to pick my car up.<//text>< Response>

I purchased a 2008 Prius from Merced Toyota. The staff there was amazing and quite knowledgeable. Bill the Finance Manager and the other Finance guy Albert were able to secure a super low interest rate for me. My Salesman Martin got me a much better deal than I thought I would get. I didn't even plan on buying a car that day! I was also able to meet Tim the Service Manager. I will be sending all of my family and friends down to Merced Toyota to get the same kind of special treatment I got.< /Text>

<text>I’m gonna be honest with my opinion with the rent to lease. I as a first time for rent to lease told differently from the seller that helped me with this rent to lease option. I was told that as I pay my month for a lease and up to two or three on the lease. I can after finance the car and whatever is left from the lease, I can finance the car just like regularly. I wasn’t told that when I finance the car, there will be a a different of financing with a interest fee rate. I mean the car I lease was 20,000 and pay for 3yrs for the lease and the car now only have 3,000 or 4,000 left, after financing the car, they are going to tell me that if I was financing the car for 12,500 with an interest fee of 10% and total will be 22,000. I was upset. I was not told that this will happen... I have no choice and no car to drive so I decided I’ll just continue and just finance the car. I just think this lease and after to finance is a rip-off customers money. Toyota finance services is just eating money from customers. This rent to lease is not an good idea. It’s rip-off for customers.<//text><name>ultragamer1</name>< Rating>

<Text>Got an e-price from them. The description of the vehicle did not match the one on line. The stock number matches. Email the guy back, name Gilbert, to verify the information. This happened around 9am yesterday. Still not heard anything. Checked this morning, the vehicle was no longer listed. Received the manager's automated email this morning asking how the situation was handled. Let him know how Gilbert left me hanging all day with no update. I doubt it matters. On here, they seem to be such a super dealership with a 4.4 star. What a bull****. Now looking at all the comment left by customers, this dealer is full of sh** and doesn't care about customer service. They only respond to POSITIVE review. Don't even want to make things right by responding to the negative ones with an apology or explanation. Most of these positive reviews were probably fake or forced to comment at and in front of the dealer. It can't be legitimate review when it is done with someone breathing down your neck the whole time. It happened to me before. Dealer wanted me to comment on there dealership right after I bought the car. So I wrote the comment right there. Couldn't say everything I wanted to because he was right there reading everything I typed. It was my first purchase and at an inexperience age. So, keep your distance or stay away from the internet sale, Gilbert.</Text><Gmap_id>0x8091425d80e95939:0x6884a9982c8b780b< /Gmap_id><Rate>1</Rate><UserId.>111816324775640681363<//UserId.></record>

<Review>Merced Toyota Internet/online quotes are not honored.  Stay away from this dealership!  Seth Allen quoted me a Costco member deal on a specific vehicle (17 Toyota Rav4) via the telephone but management refused to honor the quote and tacked on another 2k.  Even after we drove an hour to get the vehicle, the sales manager still wanted 1k over the initial quote.  We walked out.</Review>< pics>

This gentlemen in Service was incredibley rude on the phone. Laughing at me the customer.

Another visit they said they were not able to get recall parts. The said it could be months before anyone gets them. Modesto Toyota had them in and fixed the recall that day. Go up the road!</review>

Surprisingly large dealership. Very helpful and pricing is fairly competitive. Purchased my car here in the end of 2017.

Been back twice for service. Try to schedule it early in the AM because they are slow otherwise. My appointment was at 2:50, and had to wait around for someone to take my keys and then wait around some more to sign some paperwork. Didn't leave until 30 mins later.<//text>

Don’t expect the best bang for your buck here.  Was young and stupid... took the bait a couple of years ago and bought a Toyota Corolla s more expensive than anyone else who bought the same corolla that year.  This time- got smarter and did my research before purchasing a vehicle.  MSRP is not their invoice price people - they try to make you think you’re getting a good price by offering price at or just below msrp but they can’t even compete with their competitor prices 🤦‍♀️  Check other dealerships before buying from here.. you will very likely get a better PRICE.<//Review>

<review>I wish I could give this review 0 stars for how poor the service was. I went in to get a problem I had with my car fixed for the third time (please keep in mind that its a brand new car 2016) I've had to come three times already to try to have them fix the same mistakes and was refused to get help even with the insurance coverage I had. They kept making excuses and tried to get me to pay $200 when I was told it was be $0 unless it was something the insurance didn't get cover. When I politely told them all I got was a eye roll and a stare. After some time they finally agreed to look at it without the $200 cost since it was covered. Just to get a phone call that there's nothing they could do unless I paid? I bought a brand new car to avoid problems like this! And after two times they cant get a right? Such a awful place and customer service is horrible. Will never be back.<//review><name>Alejandra Velazquez<//name><time>1503447698703</time><rate>1<//rate><userid>100704183526623274509<//userid><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

We went in 10yrs ago to trade in my car for a Camry and I was literally laughed at as well as denied my keys to my car when we wanted to leave. We then left and went to Honda across the street and bought an Accord with my trade in and received a much better deal as well as being treated like a valued customer. Just recently we needed to return a lease and they treated us like trash. Everyone was just walking around bsing and we still waited 30 min to hand over the keys.

<Name>Brandon Bressler< /Name><review>The actual customer service was good. They were able to work with us to get us into a new 2012 Prius. This was back in June.

The only thing that was annoying was the fact that the AC wasn't working. Granted they attempted to do their best to accommodate us but it was still warm.

The overall experience so far has been good. We got a lease so we'll be dealing with them more.

Even a year later their customer service is still awesome. I strongly recommend getting your vehicles here. They're very helpful and will do whatever they can to get you in the car you're looking for.< /review>< GmapID>

I had issues wtih Visalia Toyota.  Merced Toyota stepped in and helped me with professionalism.  Ron the manager was great and his service team.
I recommend this dealership, they will not cheat you .<//Review>

I live in Modesto and although Merced is 40 minutes away I would gladly make the trip to have my car serviced there. Upon walking in the door I was greeted and they took care of me right away. The shuttle driver Bulbar (I think thats how I remember him saying) was attentive and courteous. The service advisor Kevin was also very attentive and made sure to let me know how the process of my service was going. Thank you Merced Toyota.<//review>< pictures>

First time potential buyer looking for a truck. I was looking for prices and information before buying. We all compare prices. Who doesnt? I was hassled in trying to buy a truck. But I was in the mood to do further research in different locations. As I kept going further onto exactly what my payment would be, I was met by a supervisor telling me I was obviously not ready to buy a truck because I wanted to further look around and find details on payments and so on. Basically felt walked off. Never going back here again. Plus I heard Modesto toyota has better pricing. Want a better price? Go to Costco. They don't need to make as much profit. That's where I'm going to purchase my first truck from.< /Text>

Cash buyers beware!!!!  I just bought a 2017 Toyota Highlander from Merced Toyota today 11/11/2017.  While our sales person was amazing (Daniel Kalhlil) watch out for the sales managers and finance department. We informed our sales agent and sales manager that we were paying cash and did not need financing. After waiting for longer than normal I approached the sales manager (Robert) and asked if we could get the paperwork done soon. He replied that "they needed to verify identity for Homeland Security Requirements", and it would take a little longer. I was fine with that and understood. They soon had the paperwork ready to go and we gave them a check for the total amount of the vehicle and left.  Within an hour of leaving I received an email from Experian that Merced Toyota had run a Hard Credit Report for vehicle financing against my credit.  WE NEVER OK'D THEM TO RUN MY CREDIT. Homeland Security requires 2 forms of identification, not a credit report.  I called the manager and asked him to call the credit agency and explain that it was run in error. He refused to do anything and told me "Do what I have to do". He never denied not having our authorization to run our credit. We will now file a complaint with all credit agencies and the BBB as well to rectify this situation. Sad that something as simple as a cash purchase had to be so complicated. We will not be going back.<//Text>

My wife and I are trying to get a 2015 Sienna. I called their internet sales manager and he told me that the numbers were close to what their website suggested for my trade-in.  My first offer from their used car manager was $13,200 for my 07 Tundra with 105k miles. According to their KBB link off their website, it gave me $16,300.  We went back and forth only to find out that the used car manager was in a hurry to go to a "BBQ" and would split the difference with me for a final offer of $15,500 for my used Tundra.  My question is why give me so much BULLS**T for hours when you told me that you could get close to the website numbers.  Isn't that a waste of your time and mine? I told myself not to buy when frustrated so my wife and kids walked away from this dealer--happy with our choice. I bought a few new cars from this place and have lost confidence in them. I will never buy a car from this place again and will share this unpleasant situation with friends, family, and colleagues.  There are lots of Toyota Dealers out there that will be upfront and not give you a bunch of bull. Trust me people--you're just going to have to travel a bit further to buy.</text>

I just recently got a car from Toyota Merced after falling victim to a bad accident that totaled my truck. At first I was contemplating another dealer but after talking with Chris Sanchez (Service Advisor for Toyota Merced) I jumped in with both feet. His honesty was amazing.  He was kind and truly got my attention with the deals Toyota Merced was having. He connected me with Greg Renwick  who is lead in internet sales and I ended up getting a brand new 2016 vehicle with zero (yes, zero) money down. His straight forward non-pushy attitude was just what I desired. (I absolute hate those people that are "Extra Pushy" to sell). Either way, Chris connected me to Greg Renwick (Internet Sales), who then finalized my papers with Bill Peters (Finance) and well, Bill was the icing on this car cake. It was like I counted to 100 and everything was complete! All three were amazing, they really have my loyalty and I couldn't have asked for greater service and experience! So, if you are looking into trading, buying, leasing or just a tune-up or tires, ask for Chris @ Toyota Merced - you will be so glad you did! Signed, Your Loyal Customer to the end, Valerie :)< /Text>

My car key broke into two pieces while I tried to start the car, I couldn't. One guy helpt me by putting ducktape around the key. He said, you have to order a new key, but it will cost you $180. So I called Toyota and left a message. Rob never called me back. Two hours later I tried another number. This guy said, we make the key in our shop, but to program it to your car, you have to come in. What I did right away. There, they told me they have to order the key, but it will cost you $140. I said, you have to pay only once $140 when you order two. They gave me a spare key to start the car. When I paid, the women said $364. I said what? She said, this is for the key and the programming the key to your car.
I was shoked and disappointed.</Text>

<review>Cash buyers beware!!!!  I just bought a 2017 Toyota Highlander from Merced Toyota today 11/11/2017.  While our sales person was amazing (Daniel Kalhlil) watch out for the sales managers and finance department. We informed our sales agent and sales manager that we were paying cash and did not need financing. After waiting for longer than normal I approached the sales manager (Robert) and asked if we could get the paperwork done soon. He replied that "they needed to verify identity for Homeland Security Requirements", and it would take a little longer. I was fine with that and understood. They soon had the paperwork ready to go and we gave them a check for the total amount of the vehicle and left.  Within an hour of leaving I received an email from Experian that Merced Toyota had run a Hard Credit Report for vehicle financing against my credit.  WE NEVER OK'D THEM TO RUN MY CREDIT. Homeland Security requires 2 forms of identification, not a credit report.  I called the manager and asked him to call the credit agency and explain that it was run in error. He refused to do anything and told me "Do what I have to do". He never denied not having our authorization to run our credit. We will now file a complaint with all credit agencies and the BBB as well to rectify this situation. Sad that something as simple as a cash purchase had to be so complicated. We will not be going back.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1510594634250, 'text': 'Phillip - Thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss with you our process and policy with regards to cash paying customers.

<rating>1</rating><review>Toyota’s customer service is lacking and leaves much to be desired. I arrived there for a 7pm appointment and even though I was a bit late I called 20 minutes ahead of time and 5 minutes after 7pm, to ensure that I was them I was headed to the dealership for my appointment. When I arrived there on an Über, the car salesperson I had scheduled my appointment with, Bianca, had already gone home. The most disappointing part of it all is that the car had already been sold the day I had made my appointment with her, two days prior, and I had not been notified about it, even though I was promised I would be. It even took the Toyota team some time to figure out that the car had been sold. Perhaps it would be good idea to keep better track of your customers and inventory.
Your ineffective communication is no one else’s responsibility but your own.
I didn’t even receive any sort of apology for the inconvenience, I only received excuses for the terrible service.
Fed up, that same day, I I walked from Toyota to Ford, and bought a car from them. You guys lost a potential customer, and you will continue to lose more if you guys do not amend an evidently broken system.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

We've been taking our Plug-in Prius here for a little over 2 years for routine maintenance and have had consistently good experiences, even if the wait is long.

Purchased a certified car, started having serious problems with it immediately after purchase. Their so called 'certified technicians' checked the car several times and could never find anything wrong, giving us the run around. Toyota corporate office got involved and referred us to a different dealership for a service check and they found NUMEROUS problems with the car. The dealership general manager Mike was nothing but rude with us and a big liar! he sent info to Toyota corporate office saying they checked the car again and found nothing, well the day he stated they 'checked, and test drove' the car was a big lie! That day we only spoke to him on the phone. WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PLACE!!! They don't own up to their mistakes and out right lie.</review>< pictures>

They weren't angry at the desk while talking too me, the greeter wasn't an a-hole, the crew wasn't sitting there laughing and pointing at your beautiful camry xse, the service driver didn't hotrod mod my whip. I'd say 5 STARS and a revisit in another 5K.< /review>

Do not take your car here unless you're ready to get it scratch. I have 2 bad experiences here. I don't recommend it at all.  I stop taking my car here. I'll rather go to fresno or modesto toyota for oil change. I'm Asian so I drive and buy Toyota.</text>

< review>
BEWARE of the merced toyota service department! I took my car in to have some recall work done and when I picked it up they proceeded to tell me my car needed $900-$1000 worth of repairs. They said I needed a transmission service(which I knew, I just wasn't going to pay dealership prices to have done), then they said I needed a new battery, new water pump and a new serpentine belt. Within a week I took my car to my regular mechanic, a shop in town that I can trust, to have the transmission serviced and have them give the car a thorough bumper to bumper check. I also specifically asked them to check the parts merced toyota told me needed to be replaced and everything checked out just fine! No repairs needed! It's been several months now and none of the supposed "bad" parts have failed or needed to be replaced. If your toyota needs repair work you're definitely better off going elsewhere. I won't go back here even for recalls. I would rather go to Fresno or Modesto for that stuff.<//review>
