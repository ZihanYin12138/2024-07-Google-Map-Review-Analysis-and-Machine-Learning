< Review>
I went here for my haircut and they messed it all up. They messed up the hard part. They messed up all of it. They are not sanitary at all. There stations are dirty. They don't clean the brushes or the razors. They don't blow-dry you off after. And they are just good awful. DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANYTHING< /Review>

I've had mixed results at this location from pretty good to. One side of my hair cut was and inch different than the other and had to ask to have it fixed. Ive since stopped going here and get my hair trimmed elsewhere.<//Review>

Horrible! I went into this place because I wanted a simple trim up and thought it would be fine. I described what I wanted to keep and she cut it off, so then we had a new plan and she cut that off as well. And then I told her to just shave it and she talked me out of that and I left with a military flat top and hair left all over my neck and face. Three strikes you suck at the ol ball game. Worst hair cutting experience of my life by far.< /text>

Booked an appointment online, walked into the place 5 minutes early, was told the other lady waiting there had the appointment I booked for my time slot and I had to wait half an hour. They then let 2 walk-ins cut in front of me while I was sitting in there waiting. After 40 minutes of waiting, I had to correct the stylist twice and point out that my sideburns were clipped unevenly. Don't ever go here, you'd be better off sticking your head in a lawn mower.</text>

I took both my girls and myself to get our hair done. My 10 year old has wavy hair and when i noticed an uneven spot on the side the lady said it's because her hair is wavy. She then fixed it. My 12 year old's hair is somewhat acceptable. But when it came to my cut i had a different "stylist". I asked for an aline i got a very short Bob. I left then called to ask them to fix it. I went back new stylist this time she was pulling my hair and poked my scalp with something. I still walked out unhappy. I went to another shop paid for them to fix it. 80$ later i am satisfied. I will never return to super cuts<//text>

Buyer beware! Stylist was incompetent. Shampoo was not thoroughly rinsed and the manager (?) somehow said I needed a glaze in addition to the $15 touch-up which is all I really needed. Never told me the cost, so imagine how that extra $50 on the bill made me feel. Then they wanted a $20 tip! I shudder to think what might have happened if I had allowed them to take a scissors to my head! Don't go there.<//review>

Worst run of all the Supercuts I've ever been to.  Chronically understaffed - seldom enough to handle even 2 of the 5 available seats.  Huge wait times.  Twice I've made appointments only to have them blown off because there's suddenly only one barber on staff.  They've even had me wait, apologizing for the delay, only to tell me shortly before closing that they they can't get to me.  Completely bogus.

When you can get in you do get a decent cut, but I strongly suggest you avoid this location if you have _any_ self respect.  Letting them abuse you with super-long wait times and blown appointments only encourages incompetent management...< /review>

< Review>
Sara the manager is a theif. She overcharges highlight jobs that are 50.00 by adding on a additional treatment called a Glaze, which is 50.00. She never offered receipt and played it off as the total price for just a highlight. She scams unsuspecting customers and lies saying it's only highlight treatment. She owes me approx 150.00 to 200.00 for the overcharges. Sara tried to do this to a few other customers but didn't get away with it. I've contacted the cooperate office so they hopefully see in their system how many times she's ripped off a customer, and hopefully  they audit her, and I filed a complaint with the BBB. I want my money for the overcharges refunded to me, and I will be contacting local news station that conducts investigations on businesses who blatantly lie and defraud consumers. The best thing SuperCuts can do is fire her and protect consumers.<//Review>

<review>If I could I would give it no stars!!
This unprofessional woman (Danielle) messed up my hair.
(She should be shameful to call herself a hair stylist.)
I’m so embarrassed to even go in public.

I went there walk-in, because near Marketplace. It was big mistake to go this place.
Completely she(Danielle) doesn’t know how to cut hair.
When she have done on my hair cut. I asked to her blow- dry my hair.
Because I realized she did horrible job.
(I was thinking after blow dry, will be better.)
Before start dry my hair, she told me.
“If you do blow-drying, price will be total $45.”
So I said “yes, it’s ok. Do it!”

Oh My God….
I was surprise that she finished blow-drying job within 5 minutes.
(Maybe she didn’t want to blow dry my hair.)

Anyway when I went to front desk for pay for it.
She charges different prices.
She charged crappy hair cut $19 + blow dry/ styling (long)$36. So total: $55

Actually my hair is short hair(It’s above my shoulders. How can say it's long hair??).
And also I didn’t get styling services!

This is totally cheating people!!!!! I never been paid for only blow-dry price for $36.
Is it make sense?

I don’t know why this kind of woman working in hair shop.
(No skillful. Unprofessional. Rude to customers. Crappy Services. She better go back to beauty school to learn more!!!)

Really is the worst hair cut I’ve ever had.
I wasted my money and my time. Will never go there again!!!

If you going to the supercuts. Make sure DO NOT LET HER (Danielle) TOUCH YOUR HAIR. You will regret yourself..< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Waited 60 minutes while only one lady out of 2 ladies cut hair for a half hour, then when the other girl started cutting hair she took 34 minutes to buzz a kid head while she walked around  every few minutes looking for who knows what. Then took a break. O I did mention there was one guy getting his haircut for 60 minutes and the buzz kid in front of me<//review>

Completely in love with this Vineyard. Beautiful surroundings, Logan was incredibly friendly and helpful, and the wines were delicious. The bottle of 2014 Pinot Noir he let us try off menu was amazing. Bought a bottle on the spot and joined the wine club. A must visit if you are in the area, especially if you’re interested in biodynamic farming.</Review>

We had decided to try the smaller vineyards on this trip, as we’ve done a lot of the big names etc
I was completely blown away here! The quality of the wines was hands down the best (I don’t normally review, but these guys are so good, I had to!)
It’s a relaxed, shady atmosphere with excellent tastings, and friendly staff....thanks Logan!< /review>

What a beautiful winery at worth every minute that you spend there. The view is fantastic and the vibe is great.

The owner was sitting there hanging out and his dog is just happily roaming around saying hello, there's just a nice family feeling to the place.

Every wine was delicious and we ended up buying two bottles.

You can even take a little stroll down on the grounds and enjoy the view.

Must visit if you are in the area.<//review>

I have been here several times and yes the view is amazing and the wine is tasty! A couple things I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews-
First, you need a reservation to get in for a tasting.  So plan ahead! Bring snacks cause you will want to linger.
Second, they offer organic wines and the land is biodynamically farmed! So inspiring.
Third, the gardens are gorgeous (lots of lavender and rosemary) and worth a stroll.
Fourth, there is a generous flat grassy area down below the tasting patio to picnic with your bottle.  We had a great afternoon with our kids there running around on the grass, coming back to the picnic blanket for a snack all while we relaxed and drank our wine.<//text>

Been coming here for a few years and love it, staff are exceptional, knowledgeable and friendly and the wines are wonderful. Definitely bring a picnic (though we keep forgetting and regret it). Their movie nights with dinner are so much fun and the setting is spectacular. A true gem.<//Review>< time>

Superb place to sit back, enjoy food and live music on a sunny afternoon while the tasting menu comes to your table at the knowledgeable hands of some of the winery staff. Prices were a little higher than other tastings, but it's worth it for the atmosphere and ability to bring food with you. Not all the wines appealed to me, but the ones that did were well received. And the property--wow. Photos are only a start. Gorgeous!</text><UserId.>110837665463050097668< /UserId.><pictures>None<//pictures><Date>1486692502050<//Date><user_name>Zachary Leuschner< /user_name><Response>None< /Response>< rate>

Disappointing service. They make you make an appointment, drive lords knows where, threaten that if you don't show up or less people in your group they will charge and then set you up with a male waiter on his period. Cancelling membership and am never coming back.< /Text>

< Review>
First and foremost the wines are amazing! The Pantheon is one of my valley favorite GSM style wines and it is super affordable. The winery visit is one of the best in experiences in the Santa Ynez Valley. It really is a small family run winery that produces some great stuff! Highly recommend for any visit to Santa Barbara wine country. Alexis is a great host and has fantastic people working hard to ensure everyone has a great time learning about their wines.<//Review>

Great venue, typical array of excellent, OK, and so-so wine selections. Did not know about the appointment only policy, but they welcomed us anyway and treated us like family. $20 tasting fee is worth it, as the servers sat us outside and came to our table with select wines. Poured some vintages off the menu too. First class service, we were impressed and we also came away with a case special for a very good price, and they waived the tasting fee.</Text>

Incredible wines in an idyllic setting with the most wonderful staff, creating an environment of love, pleasure and romance that coincide with a mouthfeel of luscious berries. Best Tasting experience In Santa Barbara or Santa Ynez!< /text>

Not really open daily 11 to 5 as their website claims, but by appointment only. Would have been nice to know before we drove an hour from SB to get there. No prob, though. Plenty of other wineries who did want our business.</Text>

<review>Demetria is by far and away my favourite winery in the area. The winery is, in fact, open from 11am-5pm. The signs and website show "by appointment only", but realistically all you have to do is buzz them at the entrance gate and they'll let you in. The appointments are helpful since the number of tables are limited (I think they have maybe 8-10 tables, 2-3 that accommodate 8-10 people) and it tends to get very busy, especially on weekends and in the spring/summer and its a popular venue for events and weddings (which means the winery would be closed to public that day). The scenery and views are breathtaking on the drive up from the gate and at the winery itself.  The wines are superb - I highly recommend the rosé (both sparkling and regular) and the pinot noirs.  The tasting room staff are incredibly nice and give great explanations and information about the wine.  The experience at Demetria makes you feel like you're family.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I was born and raised in the Napa Valley, the location alone says enough.  However, upon discovering Demetria, the location, the owners and staff, I was enlightened in a brand new way.  No offense to my home turf, but Demetria blows away most Wineries in Napa.  It's the perfect blend of seclusion, mixed with an Italian countryside feel and the staff is BEYOND friendly, always making you feel like friend and family.< /text>

This place is one of the most beautiful vineyards and tasting spots in the area, if not all of California.
The wines were perfect and the staff friendly and knowledgable. Perfect place to drink away a few hours on a hot summers day.</text>

Decent wines, although slightly overpriced.  The location is spectacular and worth the visit to just taste some wines on the patio.  The owners John and Sandra Zahoudanis were gracious hosts and made us feel very welcome even on a busy Saturday afternoon.</Review>

My favorite vineyard in Los Olivos, hands down! All the wines were great, the Sparkling Papou, OMG, Phenomenal! I went with a group of 7, the staff was very accommodating and fun, we really enjoyed the experience there and the grounds were gorgeous! Amazing place, we will definitely return and highly recommend this place if your visiting the area.< /review>

They were short staffed and had a full house but we would have never known had we not overheard one of the staff mentioning it to another coworker.  The atmosphere is relaxing, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and fun and the service is exemplary.The view is beautiful. Live, relaxing music played while we ate the charcuterie plate we brought while tasting their lovely wines. The wines are wonderful (Pinot noir was my favorite) as well as the sparkling wine. I bought a case of wine and will be back again and again.< /Review>< Pics>

A little known gem in the central coast.  A young waitress mentioned that Demetria was a favorite of the locals.  It was well worth the search and we've been back every year for a visit to Los Olivos instead of Napa Valley because of this wine and this place.   Try the Constantine and the Matia.</Text>

<review>Discovered The Kroft on a whim while searching for something different to eat. It is part of the Union Market, which has a number of interesting businesses tucked away around corners and down narrow lanes.

The Kroft, however, is an excellent and unique place to find delicious comfort food. They specialize in poutine with a fusion twist. The staff were friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. I ordered a fried chicken poutine with brussels sprouts, thinking that the combination would be only be just enough food for one person. I wasn't prepared for the enormous platter of poutine I received - it's a very generous portion that almost requires two to share! Gooey, salted cheese curds mixed very well with the fried popcorn chicken pieces drenched in thick, Southern-style gravy. The brussels sprouts were only okay - a little burned and tart for me, but the presentation was nice.

I'll be back to Union Market to try additional restaurants, but I want to return to The Kroft again for the curry chicken poutine!<//review>< Pics>

Good food. Came here on a business meeting and got the steak and zucchini blue cheese salad. I loved it and inhaled it. The only reason I'm not giving this place 4 stars was simply lack of menu options. I will probably come back and try it again (the fish churros seemed really good but I didn't want to freak out the person I was having the meeting with.)
Good service and a nice quiet dining room. Bonus points for keeping a clean bathroom.</Review>

<Text>The Kroft is my go-to place when I feel like splurging (calories-wise). All the items here are delicious. My favorite is their Country Fried Chicken Poutine. You can't go wrong with white gravy, fried chicken, fries and cheese curds. Be prepared to drink a lot of water, because the combination of all these goodness can be on the salty side.

My husband ordered the braised beef sandwich and he loved it. The beef was flavorful and tender. They bread doesn't get soggy with the juicy meat (which is a good thing).

If you're not ready to commit to a full order of poutine, I highly recommend getting an order of flaming hot cheese curds. They are delicious.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<time>1445550845305<//time><Rate>2<//Rate><Text>My wife and I looked forward to having lunch at The Kroft.  After looking around we went to the counter and ordered the chicken sandwich and an order of french fries.  We had heard that this was a new eatery with fresh ideas about how to serve food.  We were disappointed by the sandwich and the fries.
The chicken was totally overpowered by the dressing.  While not spicy, it did not allow the flavor of the chicken to come through.  Our fries arrived way over salted and were not fit to eat.  The young lady behind the counter graciously offered to, and did, replace the fries without salt.
It would appear that we may have been there too early after opening.  Perhaps the kitchen staff had not yet settled in with how to prepare the food.  Perhaps in another month a better review may be forthcoming.  This is a very crowded field and we wish them good fortune.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dcdc21d7bf692d:0x33a4435e94b6bfae< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The Kroft, specializes in comfort food, and my god it is amazing. Usually I am very concerned about what I eat and the nutritional facts of what I am eating really matters to me. But with the Kroft, no matter how artery clogging the food is, I will still come here and not feel guilty because its just that good.< /text>

I have no idea how this place has high ratings, nobody but me must've tried the French dip. The au jus was completely flavorless, the bun was already soaked and soggy when I opened the wrapper, there were no onions on it as advertised, and it was drenched in the 'horseradish mayo' which was SO STRONG it was all I could taste. The meat was the WORST quality meat I've ever been served, super tough, giant chunks of fat, and was cold. What a waste of $15! For the price and ratings I expected way more than I got here. I feel like I dumped my money in the trash, because that's what I did with the sandwich after 2 bites. The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the young lady at the counter was nice. If I had the time I would have gone back and demanded a refund. I feel like I've been stolen from.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Heard of the poutine,  but never tried it until I found the Kroft. The thought of cheese curds with my fries did not sound all that appetizing. After trying all of them at least once on different visits, I am a fan. I haven't been back as often as I would like, thanks to my good ol' cholesterol levels.< /Text>

This location is not good and its probably due to the limited foot traffic of the Union Market. The pork sandwich was super dry and its easy to tell why. The porchetta sits outs under a heat lamp and dries out. Its not an issue at the Anaheim location, which has long lines and fast turnover of food. In Tustin its pretty empty and food sits out. The prime rib sandwich was dry too, probably same reason. The poutine was very salty, from the gravy I think. Union Market is empty and The District is a poorly planned outdoor mall with self created traffic/parking issues.< /Review>

Love this place. One of my go-tos for lunch during the week. I usually get the poutine and recommend cheeseburger fries and the country fried chicken.  The amount of food you get for the price is excellent.</review>

<text>The Kroft is amazing.  They make the best sandwiches and poutines.  Every time I go to one of them, it's always consistent tasting food.

I love this location because it's right next to my work and there's actually parking not like their Packing District location.  In fact, I'm going to make far less trips to the Packing District because this gem is so much more convenient to get my food.

My favorites are the Short Rib Poutine and the Ribeye Dip Sandwich.  Whatever you order, it will be of the best quality.</text>< Pics>

<text>Good fries, good gravy, but my poutine was served with cold cheese curds on top.  I don't know if this was on purpose or not, but it sure was a disappointment.  I had tried poutine for the first time in New Hampshire just a few days ago and LOVED IT.  I came here craving cheesy gooey poutine and got cold solid cheese curds sprinkled on top instead.  Wasn't bad, just really wasn't what I expected poutine to be.  Oh well, maybe there are regonal styles I'm not aware of, but will probably keep looking for my west coast poutine spot.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>If you've never tried poutine before, I highly recommend it! French fries, gravy, chicken, cheese, you name it! They also serve local beers on tap.</Review><user_id>104137112558545727914< /user_id>< Pictures>

I was so disappointed after reading all the hype about this place. I ordered the day-after sandwich which was turkey stuffing and cranberry sauce. Every picture I saw of this particular type of sandwich posted on Instagram or other spots it looked like it was the size of a football. In reality it was the size of an orderve and ridiculously expensive. I won't be back.<//review>

< Review>
This place specializes in poutines - french fries topped with various kinds of meat or vegetables. Every poutine I have ordered so far has been a delight, especially the fried chicken poutine and katsu curry poutine. They also occasionally have special poutines just to keep things different. This is a go-to spot for me when other restaurants are busy at the District.</Review>

Oh Canada with your Maple Syrup, Hockey, smoked meats and of course the Poutine.

Originating from Quebec it really came over from England in other forms until it was refined. I mean after all this is a cold weather food meant to thicken the blood if you know what I'm saying. That there is the main difference between Canadian Poutine and the offerings here. Most of their menu is fusion of other flavors like the Chicken Katsu curry and the homage to Japanese dish. Mediterranean version of course for it's name sake. The gravy is to be thick enough to cover, but thin enough to seep down between the fries. I find it a little thin here, perfect salting and seasoning, but it's simply lacking the meatiness of the real thing.

The fries, nope not Kennebec, but that's not my biggest concern. It's the doneness of the fries. They consistently cook to a very Socal-esque level. I need real crisp, but having Kennebec would solve this. Anyhow it's like using big old Idaho russets in creole cooking. Not authentic. You must ask for a double fry, it needs to keep some crisp after gravy is poured. I do like the shaved garnishes, makes it fancy-ish.

Portions are about right, certainly not hearty enough for post drinking needs. Prices are a tad high, but the flavor profiles they are going for are higher end too. An odd balance there.

The cheese curds are plenty and flavorful. If they indeed are using fresh, local, organic, sustainable and seasonal ingredients the cheese would really pop. I get an egg on everything, literally. Gravy and egg yolk to me is on that mother sauce level.

Love the loco moco, to me more substantial than the braised short rib. I was hoping for an oxtail offering special . Short rib sandwich is much better, it's a more round profile, the bread has decent crust. Fried chicken sandwich was an item I was surprised I liked so much. Friend chicken poutine is interesting, but the cheese curds don't work the same with the different gravy. More of a béchamel versus gravy would solve both the flavors they are trying to mix. The bacon ideally should stay crispy along with the fries, they need to work on that.

Pot pie is a bit thin, chunky, but thin, not enough vegetable flavor considering they really want to go for a true filling topping. Fried cheese curds need a more acidic sauce offering.

I do not like the small boxes they serve in. It's supposed to be filling, like you can't eat a sandwich and poutine, but that's what I need to fill up here.

Great drinks, great service, they have taken to heart my many suggestions to improve most of their items and I see many of the upgrades to be integrated, I've probably told workers at both locations 30 different upgrades they could do to improve their dishes. Fusion is always better when you understand both sides of the dishes or cultures your combining. Too many poutine places I've been to the owners went to Canada once and dove right in and opened a poutinery. Not here, they are evolving, while keeping it regional.

It's a much nicer, bigger space. They offer some beer, but have refreshing drinks, but they really do out draw most of the rest of the shops here. You can catch me here for lunch twice a week and dinner once a week. See you soon, I'll be the guy with the customized orders.< /review>

<review>Absolutely awesome. Fausto was so kind and I got into a set of used tires for far less than I would’ve paid at a retail tire store. I was in and out in like 30 minutes and he was just so nice to work with. I doubt I’ll ever go anywhere else again.</review>< date>

<Review>After seeing many positive reviews, I decided to call for a price check only to be hung up on mid-conversation. Companies that cannot respect its customers in giving good customer service should not receive service from the public. Please do not spend your money here.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Great service! Did not try and sell me anything I didn't need. $30 out the door in under 30 min. They take Debit/Credit card unlike many others in the area.</Review>

I purchased two used tires for sixty dollars for the pair and came two find out that the next day one of them were bad. So I went back they told me that their was nothing that they could do. I told them what are you talking about first of all you took the money cash without a problem and second of all you don't give receipts. This place is just a rip off so any one out their plans to go their don't let your self fall in the same shoes. They need to be shut down.</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The net is good but they put me to start a morito who did not know anything made me wait 40 min for a patch ?? Besides, when I made him air, I checked it later and he had put 60 psi in a tire that only had to make 40 maximum, very dangerous, it would have exploded on the freeway

They were all very kind, and funny- which allowed for me to feel comfortable and welcome in their office. I highly recommend this office!< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I am always happy to go in and see Dr. Blair Ball, Laurie, and Carly! Every time I visit it’s a delight, everyone is helpful and friendly and Dr. Ball is the best optometrist I’ve ever been too, and I’ve seen plenty over the years due to living in different areas. I recommend him to everyone I know. Retail chains like Sears, JCPenney, etc., will claim they save you money but the bottom line is they’re not really saving you money and you are not getting the best exam out there. Your eye health isn’t always about needing glasses and you’re in good hands at Dr. Ball’s office.</text>< userid>

These guys are experts. Professional and friendly. The doctor explained everything in plan understandable terms. They have a wide selection of glasses to chose from and they let you take your time chosing. I had a great experience and would definitely go back again.</text>

The people here are really nice.  They are hospitable and make you feel very comfortable.  Dr. Blair uses very nice equipment..... However, when it comes to billing, I had such a horrible experience.  The very young woman who pulled my insurance somehow tried to charge me off of a previous insurance from an old employer that had been expired for a whole year. They tried to charge me way too much money for my exam and my contacts.  I left and did not go back to get a supply of contacts, so I never received any products from them, yet they chose to bill my insurance anyways! (The correct one since they found it after I told them there had to be something wrong because I shouldn't have to pay such outrageous fees.) . I attempted to go somewhere else that was in my insurance's network and they said that because this place already charged my insurance that they could not cover my order.  I had to go back to this place to settle the matter.  This office then told me that if I did not pay for the product that they ordered for me (that I didn't authorize) that I would have be responsible for the full cost of the product. Absolutely infuriating! I feel as if I was backed into the corner and robbed by this establishment.  WILL NEVER GO BACK.< /Text>

If I have a concern, it is handled quickly and efficiently and I appreciate that. I have a life and I don't want to have to "deal" with office people. Everyone there is professional and genuine. I love them.</review>< pictures>

<review>I would like to complement the following staff starting from Dr. Jeremy, then 2nd to none are these very friendly people : Carly & Laurie; In my books these two ladies from 1 to 10 they're no. 11 & if you ask me, they're both deserve a significant pay hike. Compared to other Opthometrist & Opthalmologist offices, they cannot even come close to these ladies. They are customer friendly, very concern, knowledgeable; they answered correctly our questions & concerns. Me & my wife, Ofelia are very happy to come back because of their honesty.< /review>< Name>

They took excellent care of our family and am disappointed in myself because  we didn't come here sooner since we've been in this area for 18+ years.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80db437d571872af:0xd506b9914d4501c< /GmapID></record>

<Text>I was not happy with this place at all. There was not enough selection of frames. No personality....very cold! Glasses are cheap looking and still don't fit. I won't go back because you feel like you're putting then out. I have never been to a more un welcome place. I have heard this from many others lately too. I never send reviews  but these glasses were almost $800.00 there!!!! :-(< /Text>< name>

I went in early to pickup the paperwork and I was told they had a cancellation. I decided to stay and hope for the best. When she would cry,  the staff would come over on more than one occasion, to soothe her.  When she cried during my exam the Dr acted like it wasn't even happening instead of getting annoyed. Would definitely come back.<//text>< Resp>

Great finds and great customer service!! Matthew was awesome he was very patient and took the time to help us load some heavy duty furniture into our van ! We’re definitely going back there first when we need another piece of furniture, we got a couch , dresser and desk and all of it was very clean and well priced.</Text>

<username>Megan Morris</username><Review>First time at this store. It was well organized! Things seemed to be spread out, not all squished in piles. But there also wasn't a whole lot in the store. The price tags seem a bit high on most items I looked at, some even around the same cost as the items would be brand new from walmart. I picked up 2 items from the Christmas stuff clearly marked 75% off, but was told at the register that they have to be over a certain price point to count for the discount?! :/  He was friendly, but that's still a frustrating thing when the signage clearly doesn't say that. Also, there was a staff member in the back apparently on her phone, swearing all kinds of obscenities loudly. I kept looking at the cashier to see if he'd talk to her since there were some children in the store with their parents and her voice was LOUD. He seemed like he was use to it and just went about his own way.</Review>< userid>

Their knickknacks were cheap and staff seemed friendly. They do not have a dressing room so wear something that is easy to try clothes over if you are getting clothes, and find a random mirror. They said they take returns only for merchandise credit if something doesnt fit but it is easier to just try it on in the store before you forget to return it, just imo. Someone please update me if there is a place to park because I just parked down the block and forgot to ask.< /text>

Food is pretty standard for a KFC... If they could actually get your order correct. Who forgets 8 pieces of a 16 piece order?

At the very least, they are quick to rectify their mistakes.<//Text>

I understand why they do this, but I can assure the staff that while it may be stress inducing, orders would be a lot more efficient keeping people in line. Plus I'd rather wait 15 minutes in a long line, then wait 5-10 minutes out front because I thought it was empty. Putting cars out front only allows more cars to add to the work load.<//Review>< rating>

I've been to this KFC about 3 times now. I would say this is by far the worst KFC branch that I have ever been to. They never have the chicken that you're trying to order-the lady running the drive thru is hard of hearing. I don't recommend coming here, save yourself the trouble and just go to Popeyes which is located right down the street.< /Review>

Everything is wrong with this place. I ordered through the app and it still took 45 minutes. It wasn't even busy. I have no idea what the employees are doing but it's definitely not their jobs.< /Text>

<Text>The WORST Customer Service Ever!
Food was TERRIBLE! Colonial Chicken Sandwich was so Greasy that the buns were soggy and Orange from the Grease my French fries were cold. I had to ask for my Drink and the kid acted like I was troubling him! I will NEVER Return to this place! I'd rather drive 20 miles outta my way than to eat here!< /Text></record>

After a nice summer afternoon my family decided to re-live through the nostalgia filled trips we used to take to KFC back when it was a half-competent restaurant. We walk in and as I guessed there was no line as returning customers are a rarity at this establishment. We ordered a combo for each of us, 5 pieces of chicken in each. But when we opened the bag at home I was shocked to my CORE. Not only was each combo only 3 pieces, one was straight up missing. This was the scam of the century - giving those who remember the great, tender, finger-licking good dreams of the Colonel hope to taste the beautiful golden brown crust - and then ultimately crushing those same dreams within the reveal of the orders contents. I’m not mad, but I’m an emotional wreck as a result of the trip.</text>

Don’t go to the KFC in Brentwood, every time I go there something is wrong.  Kids managing kids.  Today was the frosting on the cake.  Ordered a 4 piece meal combo, was told out of chicken would be 25 mins.  Or they could give me 4 legs. I asked to talk to the manager.  The manager if she really was a manager no tag was another kid with a disc in her tongue. I told her I did not want to pay $10.99 for 4 legs. She said she would charge me $6.99 for 4 legs.  Drove out  opened the box and two small legs and very little wedges.  I worked for KFC all thru high school I’m now 65 never remembering such poor service.  The KFC on Deer Valley is always good!< /review>

Online clearly states lonetree location is open until 10:30pm. Went through the drove through at 10:15pm and no answer. Drove up to the window and they worked said "they were closed" and I said, "no your not online says 1030" worker said "no that's a mistake"  so I said "my wife is pregnant and, the worker said that's not their problem". Never got my order right in the past anyways. Lost yet another customer<//review>

Food was good. Something to I form the customers is wait times. I didn't realize it was going to be 10 minutes. So I went back through the drive thru to find out they gave my food to someone else. I am not an online basher. So. I gave 5 stars. But keep in mind when going. Longer than normal wait times for this place< /review>

<review>Tonight i experience a horrid display of customer service and store management that i may have ever seen so far in life. Tonight at a KFC off Lone Tree Way ran into a bit of a snag serving customers. The service of food seem beyond slow. Customers came back with food in hand due to mistakes in their order. Doors were locked to keep customers and complaints outside while vividly trying to ignore. Young man and women appear to be left alone to do their best and operate a fast food chain they didnt seem prepare for the task and with no management to be found nor aid in fixing the problem. I witness a young man set up to fail as his registers according to him lack the proper change to give back proper refunds to angry patrons who had no other choice but to leave a few dollars richer due to the lack of change. I had to witness a young man panick in the face of the customers who were right to be upset yet some of the blame should go to the management! I still feel sorry to this gentleman as it seem like he barely had help nor a chance this night to be successful.....he was doom to fail by whoever running the show at this restaurant or whoever is in charge of the store all the way up to a District Manager. I hope others from this night that was disappoint with the results will speak out as something at this location needs to change or just call it quits and shut the doors for good.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808ff8c77d83878d:0xcedb0e93d728ec24< /Gmap_id></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Twice we've gone here around 6pm, most recently yesterday.  When ordering I was told they were out of white meat chicken.  They only had thighs left.  Not sure how this happens at a place that has chicken in their name.

I've never been able to eat from this location, but after seeing the other reviews about the inside cleanliness, I am glad they run out of chicken and couldn't complete my order.

Never again will I try this store.  Employees were not even apologetic about it, I'm sure they love it and just slack off for the last 4 hours of work each night.

The owner should fire everyone, including the manager for letting this go on.</Text>< Pictures>

If I could give it 0 stars I would. Doors were locked at 515pm, ordered food to eat in was given bags, when asked for plates was given trays, waitee 25 minutes for food after watching drive thru people just flow through, staff had attitude when asked for spork.<//review>

<Review>I actually tried the A&W double cheeseburger. It was horrible. Cheap meat, only available with mustard /ketchup, no pickles or onions. No flavor on the meat, just a cheap cut of beef. I practically gagged when I took a bite.< /Review></record>

<Text>This is my second or third time I decide to stop to get something to eat at this place, I waite over then 5 minutes for somebody come and ask me if I need help, then when finally somebody come first question was if I planning to pay cash or credit card I believe because they have no change available, after I start to placing my order they informed me they have only crispy as my option, I agree to give a try but after they take my order they come and informed me again they only have wings and brest, come on what kind of business is that. Please if you can't offer a good customer service and at least 90% of your menu as available. Please close it down your fast food restaurant.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
My food was fine but the service is really slow and unorganized.

Just heard an employee saying "what's burning?"

Someone was waiting for 5 minutes when I walked in.

Another customer has been waiting 5 minutes.

They were more concerned about the receipt paper than giving me my drink when I didn't care about the receipt. It took 2 people to figure out the receipt paper installation.

Otherwise it seems fine but I expect better.</Review>

<Review>I took my fam there to beat the heat by getting an assortment of large floats, and was told that they had all flavors, so I wanted the orange dream flvrd, no orange soda, and no Dr. Pepper,  & I don't like Pepsi, Rootbeer,  or Coke, ended up with a Pepsi mixed w/Rootbeer😟🤯🤯my grandson mom  ended up with a Pepsi float, my grandson changed his mind after all the confusion, he's only 6yrs old, and my son wanted water only, and they wanted to charge for the cup as if you're buying a soda, so he was livid!, he'll probly write a poem about it!😂😂 so beware when the cashiers tell you, We have all flavors!😟💆‍♀️🤷‍♀️ It's not always true...< /Review>< Response>

<Review>Without a doubt the worst service of any KFC I've visited. EVERY employee on their cell phone and trying to stay out of view. Had to call out for someone to help. As soon as they finally take your order, they disappear from the counter and are back on the cell. I asked the cashier if they were allowed to be on their phones while working and she couldn't answer me. We have made multiple visits hoping the service was just a fluke, but it is their normal service. Will not go back.< /Review><Time>1536192785306< /Time><rate>1< /rate><Response>None</Response>< pics>

This place is dirty run by trashy people. They make you repeat your order at the window each time and they have such long wait times  they make you back your car up in  line and  pull foward again to restart the timer.  Or they make  you pull  in  front and wait 10 minutes. Not not sure why they aren't ready for bussiness if they're no customers.< /Review>

Didn't receive the biscuits that I paid for, the place was absolutely disgusting and the staff was unable to fill my order correctly. Don't waste your time and go to Popeye's instead, they are much cleaner and faster as well.</text>

<review>This location is the worst that I've ever been in.  The staff didn't know the menu and they didn't have any chicken ready.  The place was empty except for the one customer in the place who was waiting for his food and warned me of the wait. I had to wait 20 minutes for my food. Popeyes is down the street and they always have food ready.< /review>< rate>

Corporate🤜 needs to come down here ASAP I will not be recommending this KFC to anyone I know as long as they don’t change management.      If I could I would rate 0/5*’s

Chicken was cold👎 under cook had to wait 30 minuets for food the place was dirty bath room was not kept up to “Helath standards” what so ever EWWW don’t get me started on the
—->customer service was god afoul

Oh and they cut you on food so always make sure you get the right amount of food 😂 cuz trust me that’s just what they do here take your business to another location just NOT HERE

Sad part is I love KFC and have been a customer sense my first time when my grandpa took me to get my first pice of chicken 🍗😭.

Please KFC headquarters do a surprise inspection and see what I mean 👀.< /review>

It was only dark meat available.  The other times there was no chicken available!?!! After complaining to the manager on 2 occasions; his response was that it was the busy time and I could wait 30 minutes. People at the drive thru were not pre-warned. They were forced to wait in their cars until they reached the intercom.
KFC is a good fast food place, however, this 1 is by far the worst!
Go to the one located on brentwood blvd. Just out side of lone tree way and get chicken everytime!<//review>< rate>

Took someone 5 minutes to take my order on drive thru. To top it off I was stuck in their drive thru line for 20 minutes!!! Once I got to the window they didn't even know what i ordered. Management needs to step up their game. Ridiculous.<//Review>

< Review>
There was only one person working the counter and he seemed very unorganized. He kept leaving and when he came back with other people's orders, he took his time coming back to the register to take my order (and I was the only person in line at the time). It took almost 15 minutes to get just an order of fries and cheese curds.<//Review>

There is plenty of bleacher seating for the usual crowds at these types of games. There is plenty of parking at either end of the park. The fields are wheelchair accessible, as well. If you have a dog, then there is plenty of open grass area to walk them, but clean up your dog's leavings. There is a concession stand as well.

Love this place! The staff is amazing! And they don’t expect you tip in order to give you great customer service! They just treat you with respect! And have an amazing Vietnamese coffee and breakfast sandwiches.
Yum 😋</text>

<review>Another wonderful chance find! My chai tea was perfect (with 2 milk alternative options), and the lovely lady helping me suggested an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese, delicious! I thought it was just bagels, but it is so much more! Omelettes, burritos, sandwhiches, vegan options, fabulous! Looking forward to returning :-)</review>< Pics>

This place came on on my search for bagels and it Did not disappoint!  The bagels were chewy, soft and delicious as a good bagel should be... and sandwiches are super tasty! One of the best tasting bagels ever.
There was a time when i placed a large phone order and one sandwich was made incorrectly, I called them they were willing to fix it and give me the exact order without cost no questions asked.  I would definitely make it a point to stop by this place for a good bagel sandwich every time I’m in the area.</review><time>1578590163154< /time><pics>None</pics><name>Marlene Unisa</name>< Rating>

<review>Bought 2.5 dozen of assorted bagels for my company. Everyone loved and asked where I got it from because the cream cheese is homemade, the bagel are fluffy and tasty. Daily Bagel Cafe. Great job. Probably best to get it right after they open. I got the batch right of the oven. Even after a day they are still great!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I've been going to this place since I was a kid. I'm still going as an adult, which says a lot. When I was a kid I didn't really have much of a say over which bagel place we went to nor did I really care. I just wanted a bagel, it didn't matter where I was getting that bagel, unless I had to go super far away for that bagel or if it was a place that didn't specialize in making bagels. Like if I got a bagel from a place that mainly sells burritos or pho and they sold bagels on the side...that probably wouldn't be a great bagel. Pretty much my criteria as a kid for bagels was a place that was close and specialized in making bagels. The Daily Bagel Cafe has both of those things. It's only a 10 min drive away and you know they specialize in making bagels if "bagel" is literally part of their name.

As I got older, I started making more decisions for myself, which meant trying other bagels from other bagel shops. Throughout my lifetime I've tried many bagels from many different bagel shops. Even after going through so many other bagels, I still think Daily Bagel Cafe has the best bagels. They were my favorite when I was a kid, they are my favorite now, and they'll probably be my favorite till I die.< /text>

I am a regular here. A breakfast in the weekend sets me ready for the coming week. They have a wide variety of bagels used in multiple genre - with classic spread, sandwich, BLT... The ladies who run this place are extremely efficient, generous, good humored and just nice.</Text>

<text>This place has great bagels. Not great customer service. I frequently am treated like I am an inconvenience to the workers. I have tolerated this treatment for many visits here. Today was the final straw. When I asked for my dozen bagels to be sliced, I was told it would cost me a dollar per bagel! Never again.<//text><Time>1572930501206< /Time></record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Always go here for bagels whenever I get a craving.
Their selection is great, and they have many different bagel and spread combinations you could choose from.
I personally favor their jalapeno cream cheese and their onion, jalapeno, jala-cheddar, everything, and garlic bagels.
You also can get the bagels toasted twice for crispiness before digging in.
Get in early, if you arrive after 11 on the weekend their selection is usually sparse.
They open early and are always kind to the customer.
Definite must for anyone in or visiting Morgan Hill.</Text>< username>

<review>The bagels itself are good. They charge over a dollar to add cream cheese which seems a little rediculous. I was thinking of getting a bagel sandwich but saw their preparation station and decided not to due to it's grimy appearance. I'd come back if I was with people who wanted to go but I probably wouldn't go on my own.< /review><userid>113582349409165660055</userid></record></dataset><record>

Service is a little weird, but the food is ok. I had a very dry sandwich but my friend liked her plain bagel. It's a cozy place, but not for a nice breakfast. It's a good place to meet up.<//Review>

My Swiss bagel with cream cheese was yummy with the perfect chew and very fresh. My vanilla latte was hot and just the right amount of vanilla syrup.  I will be back.< /Review>

Good for a quick breakfast sandwich. They are very fast in getting food to you. Great espresso drinks available as well.</text>

<Review>I was dubious of a bagel place so far from any dense population center, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the lux with cream cheese sandwich on an onion bagel and found it tasty and filing. I especially liked how the bagel was crisp on the outside but soft on the inside.< /Review>< user_name>

Stopped in for a quick breakfast. They had a good selection, helpful staff, and a clean dining room. The food was also spot on and reasonably priced.<//review>

1st time there will also be my last. No customer service. I ordered a bagle with sausage and cheese..they put egg on it I did not want and charged me for it.i had to ask for a refund. They reluctantly gave me then try to short me on it when I found it the 2nd bagle I ordered which was 8 buck and had hardly any cream cheese or lox. On the bagle and when I asked them to put more cream cheese they tried to take it out of refund for the egg. Really?? And I couldn't find the lox. It seems I paid 8$$ for sprouts and tomatoes ... Poor business.</Text>

It has become our new neighborhood pot shop.
I like being able to run in and get something quickly.
They do not have a large selection tho.< /text>

Do not go this place. They are not responsible for what they are selling. You have to contact manufacturer yourself if not working properly. I don’t believe this. I</Text>

<Text>Okay, this particular dispensary is VERY close to where I live, so, clearly, it's the one I go to.  I've read another "review" of this place, which really turned out to be a review of their security having an attitude.  I can't speak to that, never having had any trouble with their security.  What I WILL say is that CPR Collective supplied me with good marijuana, without any trouble at all, for a price that I can't honestly evaluate, since I don't have a lot of experience with any other dispensaries.  What I bought IS good weed, and I thought the price was perfectly reasonable (remember, I used to buy my marijuana while it was still illegal, so I used to pay MUCH more than now!< /Text>< Date>

<Text>The best dispensary in Los Angeles County hands down! The friendliest of staff are there ready to make your day a thousand times better and have the best recommendations. They're always in stock on my favorite concentrate items. And even with the new taxes this shop still has fair pricing. Seriously don't waste your time anywhere else if you live near Northridge and have a medical card.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Great shop, friendly and helpful staff. They have always taken care of me if there was an issue with a product. Best selection of vaporizer cartridges that I have found in the area. I always come here when i need more vape pen stuff.<//Review>

<Text>Horrible place their scales are off. I buy one top shelf 8th a week but when my car broke down and could only come here... I ended up buying THREE 8th's a week.
Something is wrong with this club because no other club has done this to me.
I lost a lot of money because of them ripping me off without even allowing me to put a dollar on the scales to check if it's properly calibrated.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>If you’re thinking about ordering from here DON’T, we opted for the delivery option in light of covid of course. The waffle was the worst dry thing I’ve ever tasted. I ordered the “strawberry cheesecake waffle”... it came with a cardboard tasting waffle and a PIECE of cheesecake on the side. $8 for 4 pieces of floppy bacon... biscuits and gravy were so salty.. I am not picky AT ALL but the only slightly good tasting thing with this order was the bacon. Also called to make sure we got everything right beforehand and they forgot our other pecan bacon waffle. Worst breakfast order I’ve ever had.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyq1ZNj9xRfp6_ylxW2_xxtSMiur6A_BBXUWmA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNylFwTxZRhu9iaPn0kPPaGsJxVniSQblNBUg9f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

Tried this place for the first time and the food was terrible. Potatoes were bland and uncooked. I tried the ham and cheese skillet and it had no flavor— hard onions, and cold cheese. I was really hoping we were going to have a good experience because they are located in our neighborhood, and I wanted to be a long time customers. Unfortunately, my family decided they’d rather eat McDonald’s breakfast than eat here again. If you’re going to charge high prices, the food should be up to par.< /text>

Nice and friendly atmosphere, food is very good and tasty. Service is a bit slow, but it gives you ample time to decide what you want without feeling rushed. I would recommend this restaurant.< /Text>

<review>First time back after a year. Not happy
Not the same smiling faces I use to experience.  Complaining waitress.  Waffle was undercooked and missing the pecans??? She never came back to check on our satisfaction or refill our coffee. Had to reach out to other employees for silverware, napkins, missing toast, and a ticket.< /review>< Pics>

I've always seen this place on my way home and it wasn't until I took my mom that I realized I had been missing out. I give it 5 stars because it's just so convenient being around the corner from me. It's hidden but not hard to find. When you walk it you're immediately greeted and you're able to seat yourself. Service is prompt and kind. The food is really good! I've had their breakfast burrito and their vegetarian omelet, and although I love hash style potatoes their country potatoes are deliciously seasoned and are cut potato chip style which allows them to be cooked better. I 100% recommend this place. I will return to try their Waffles, after all they are a waffle house. They also have specials that the whole family can enjoy!</review>

Just went there to order and the place was packed! Patrons, waitresses and cooks were not wearing masks and no one socially distanced! Why are people so selfish as to believe their rights are more important than other's right to live. I will never eat at this place. Not now and not ever...COVID-19 or not. If this place blatantly does not follow public health guidance, what other public health guidelines are they refusing to follow????<//text>

Very lovely and cozy place! I have never had any issues with ordering and wait time. Family and date friendly. The menu offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Food is flavorful and plenty, just one order of anything really fills me up. Service is good as well, highly recommend!<//Text>

First time at the Waffle Shop. They serve a lot of food. Ordered the special omelette and they offer country potatoes. Great cold filtered water and the wait staff is very personable. I can see why they stay busy.

Review above is for the food but I give it a one because the owner made some very senseless and disparaging comments that if I were eating here I would want to know. They will not get anymore of my business sadly.< /text>

<review>Gave it a two star for the service. Since our last time here, the quality has gone down. Ordered a bacon omelette w/ country potatoes and a side dish of biscuit and gravy. My omelette had a very sweet taste to it. My country potatoes were plain and looked undercooked. I have been to other places where they at least attached onions and peppers to them. The gravy was fine but the biscuit itself was very chewy.</review>< pics>

I was excited to find a cute little breakfast place around the corner from home. Except that when I walked in noticed the ambiance was much “different” than expected. The food tastes like it came out of a box. The waffles were cold (all 4-5 times we’ve gone). And the staff not friendly.

Save your money and take yourself over to Benaddiction (I have no affiliation but their food is good and the people are friendly).</Text>

Wanted to try but once I saw the crowds of people they allow in and the type of crowd they have recently generated I don't feel as though they are operating safely at any capacity during these special circumstances. There are ways to open safely and many other restaurants are examples of that but apparently Waffle Shop doesn't care about their customers enough to put in place safety measures for not only their customers but employees as well.</Review>

<text>Friendly service and good food. It's a LITTLE pricy for the quality, but the short wait and friendly service make it a reasonable trade-off.

There's no alcohol, so if you're looking for a proper brunch this might not hit every mark, but the Chicken & Waffles was great, and the coffee was fresh.

Definitely a great spot for families!< /text></record>

<Text>I always see this restaurant and had the chance to try it.  My sister and I tried an assortment of items we shared the blueberry waffle and Denver omelet with the country side potatoes, biscuits and gravy. The waffle and omelet were great. I decided the next weekend to give it another try now with my boyfriend. I tried the French toast eggs bacon and sausage. The French toast was perfect as for the eggs and bacon not so great the eggs were a little cool and the bacon didn't look fresh. I would definitely stick to the waffles or French toast. The staff was nice but the food could use a little help.</Text><time>1562612331901< /time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Decided to try this place for Sunday morning breakfast, we did the takeout option given the circumstances. The whole quality of it was just 👎. Huge disappointment. The food was super oily the toast (the bread) wasnt even toasted just completely buttered up. The butter wasnt even melted. The hash browns were soggy. But worst of all, the steak 😞 the 1/3 of the steak was good, the rest was just fatty chewy stuff. I will say though the French toast was okay I got a the kids meal for my daughter and it was good enough for her, they got the drink wrong on her order but she enjoyed her toast.
I would definitely not go back or reorder or recommend.<//Text>

Bland, mediocre food. Save your time and money and just make frozen waffles at home instead, they'll taste better. Place is run by entitled people that think they are above the law and don't care about public health and safety.<//Review>

<text>This is the waffle shop that has been opening in defiance of the Covid 19 health restrictions.

Wow best place in town. This was my first time here. I had the chicken and waffles, and I truly believe this is the best spot in the valley for them. Definitely will be back here for more. And for years and years to come. And not just the food, the entire restaurant as a whole. The wall decor is very pleasant and different from other places. Absolutely gem of a restaurant. I love it.</Text>

OMG. !!!!
YOU want THE BEST WAFFLE in town/ central valley?
The Waffle shop has the best waffles ever!!
Consistently friendly excellent service,greeted with a smile and hello from the cooks. Food is scrumptious, hot off the griddle,and I think about the chicken and waffles all the time.
You gotta try it.Great restaurant.
Ok,I'm going back for more.💨🍽️!

I had a very long review drawn up. I guess it never saved.  From what I recall, some of the food wasn't very hot when it was served.  We were sat at a very small seating for 5 after waiting about 20 minutes.  It was hot as hades in there, I don't think they had any AC.  I think the flavor of the food was okay, from what I recall (mostly).  I might try it again, but it sure would be nice if they had some working AC in this place when it's almost 100 degrees outside and the place was crammed. Oh yeah, the sausage was burned and didn't taste that great, and the potatoes were very greasy, I do remember that.  The service was slow.  They also forgot one of our plates initially. Orange juice tasted like it was made from frozen concentrate.

We are new to the area here, but a few people have mentioned that this is the best breakfast place in town and not to bother going anywhere else.  That makes me wonder if that is the case. If so, that's sad.  For the price, I felt the food was just "meh".< /Text>

Today was my first time eating here. I literally googled waffle shop and it popped up. The pictures and reviews is what enticed me to visit. It was a busy morning and there were a lot of people but the staff were brilliant and very attentive. The food was on point and to top it all off they gave me a random 50% discount. I am very glad I made the choice to come.</text>

<review>Some of the worst service ever. Waitress’s were lost unorganized and frankly incompetent. The food itself was good but was sitting under the heat lamp for almost 10 minutes before it was brought to the table. Food was brought out and wasn’t correct and the silver wear was very dirty.< /review><user_name>Thomas<//user_name>< date>

I Had breakfast this morning, Kristie was my server I believe. Awesome service, Coffee nor water never went empty. And got my food within 5 min of ordering. The place was pretty busy, I was surprised I got my food that fast. And the food was amazing. I HIGHLY recommend this place. 5+ stars< /review>

Waffle Shop is one of the best hole in the wall breakfast and lunch locations in Fresno. I have been going there for about 4 years now and they never let you down. The food is always fresh and tastes amazing and the staff is always welcoming and attentive. I will continue to go to Waffle Shop. Thanks< /review>

<Review>We ordered avocado omelets. The cook, didn't tell the waitress, they were out of avocados. So she brought us omelets with only eggs. She thought nothing of... expecting us to eat ,something completely other than what asked for...She was not honest, until we had the egg only omelet sitting on our table! That was wrong of her. She should have asked if we wanted at all, knowing what the cook did to us..And the cook should be fired. PIersonally, I will never... go back. And the price, was "way higher" than other surrounding breakfasts businesses. Stay away from them: Is my personal opinion. Communication, and integrity, are not served here.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I can say I eat at the waffle shop often and I take my family and friends to enjoy the food there. Today for the first time I went In to order take out for my pregnant daughter that is due at any time now and was craving waffles. So what better place then the waffle shop I thought. Well, I guess you have to eat there to get good service because as soon as I said take out the waitresses demeaner  changed. I placed my order paid with card and was planning to leave a cash tip but not after the rude service I received from the blond waitress at the counter. She handed me the food with attitude. This is not towards the cooks. The cooks actually greeted me with a smile and were very helpful directing me to my food that was sitting at the counter. You should replace your waitresses with your cooks. They know how to wear a smile even if it's fake< /review>

Did not like the service with reason of being busy and no help,does mean you may be rude to the customers. Food is cold and the manger needs to be professional about his job. 😡😠</text>

I had good food and service other times I had been here but it was different story today. The place was warm and the waitress was rude. We asked for coffee several times to no avail, this seemed to irritate our waitress. One of the cooks noticed my wife was needing coffee and he got our waitresses attention, which only seemed to piss her off. However the food was good.</Review>

PLEASE "DO NOT" TRY THIS PLACE!!!😞👎 the service was not professional. Food was greasy and I asked for (egg whites) I do not think having York was my asking.  And if PLEASE🤢 the manager needs to dress the part. He dresses as he does not know what a shaver is or dress out of bed.<//review>

I made a phone order at 10:25am, girl said food would be ready in 15 minutes. I gave her 20 minutes before I chose to walk in. They had me waiting an extra 10 minutes before anyone took my money to pay. Then she said she’ll get my order ready. I waited another 5 minutes until I walked up to her at the main desk and she was doing something other than getting my order ready. I seen my boxes sitting there on the counter since I showed up. I asked her if my food was ready and she said- oh! Let me put it in a bag. I was so irritated. I spent $30 and an extra 30 minutes for nothing. Food was cold and servings were poor, hardly any food in the boxes for $13. Never going here again.< /review>

It’s weird seeing the negative reviews because me and my husband have never had any problems and we have been there multiple times different waitresses and food always came out amazing. We always make sure to tip 5$ because we are always pleased to be there♥️<//Review>

Didn't have a great food experience.
Steak had burnt particles from the grill. I ordered sausages twice never received them.
Orange juice was over priced 3.99 didn't get a refill. It was super busy and only one waitress maybe that's why. But like I said they where friendly and j the waffles where good and big.toast where also good and my spouse said there coffee was good.</Text><Gmap_id>0x809468bea1320957:0x6726ba0e9326ea4c<//Gmap_id></record>

This food is Fantastic! However, I tried to use a Savearound coupon, (coupon book) buy one get one free with 2 beverages on Saturday and they said no coupons accepted on the weekend. So today is Monday (a few weeks later) and they said we do not accept those coupons period. They also said the manager was not able to speak to me about it.  I WILL STILL PAY AND EAT THE FOOD THOUGH! LOL. great food!< /text>

The food was fabulous and the server we had was quick, attentive, and quick witted. She took care of our rowdy party of 7 like a champ and kept our add ons straight. I will go here again when I'm in town again.< /review>

ROACHES!!!
Was hungry but didn’t feel like making breakfast, so I remembered there was a Waffle Shop on my way home, so I stopped.  Friendly waitress took my order and brought the food promptly.  During the meal the eyeballs on my friend got as big as silver dollars as she pointed towards my shoulder! I looked over and saw a roach casually crawling towards my sweat jacket I was wearing, so I jumped out of the chair and quietly told the waitress, as I did not want to alarm anyone or embarrass her.  What threw me off was that she got a ketchup bottle and tried to kill it, exclamaiming that she’d throw the bottle away later.  Furthermore, for such an unfortunate eating experience as first time customers, I would’ve at least cut the bill in half, or not charged at all, but I paid full price and tipped her.  Unfortunately, we won’t be back.< /text>

They opened in defiance of the County order - obviously don’t care about public health.  Won’t eat there again!<//review>

Terrible! Restaurant was not busy yet food took more than 45 minutes only to come out wrong. Then it took another 15 to fix one of the orders. No manager visible, place was disorganized and staff didn't seem to care. Needless to say, never going back.</review>

Honestly I thought they were riding the waffle shop name train but they have the best waffles I've had. They have their breakfast game down to a science. Love the location on the loop. If your in the area you should stop by, you won't be diasapointed< /Text>

This location is not a reflection of the other Waffle Shops I have been to and enjoyed, and maybe they were just having a bad morning at this location. This was my first time to this location so it's all I have to rate it on........ From where my table was I could see into the kitchen and proceeded to watch one of the cooks only wearing one glove while working, while the other cooks had on two. This cook while wearing the same glove wiped counters, handled the broom stick and swept. Then proceeded to use that glove hand to handle plates and utensils while using his bare hand to take the waffles off the grill and put them on the plates. I watched all this for at least 20mins, and he never changed the glove or washed his hand(s) between activities. And while all this was happening another staff memeber was constantly yelling loudly at the busboy to clean tables faster, even though he was the only one doing tables for the whole place during a busy morning. And then when my food finally came my gf's omelette was cool to the touch and the cheese wasn't melted. They poured strawberries out of a jar onto my waffle, that had already been handled with a bare hand, causing it to be the consistency of bread sitting in water. So needless to say we did not eat our food and left. I try very hard to not leave bad reviews because I believe a business is trying their best and bad reviews can hurt a families well being, but what I saw that morning was ridiculous.< /text>

<Text>Called in my order for chicken and waffles. I waited at the counter for several minutes before I was acknowledged by the 3-4 employees near the register. I didn't check my food until I got home. The meal comes with a waffle, a breast, a thigh, a wing and a leg. Attached is a picture of the wing and the leg!

The serving sizes are generous. Note: the chicken and waffles are not on the menu, you have to ask. Also, they do not accept coupons on weekends. Lastly they are very busy in the morning and you may have to wait for a waiter/waitress to assist you.< /Text>

Waffle Shop=Bad Customer Service!

My wife and I were attempting to be seated this morning but no one seemed interested in accommodating us.  There were four employees standing around doing NOTHING!   When I asked if this was a bad time, I was ignored.   I then used very descriptive language to express my displeasure with this unacceptable level of customer service.  I would advise everyone to avoid this establishment at all costs.  If this had occurred where I work, employees would have been fired.   I would have posted with zero stars but the minimum this site allows is one star.

AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT LIKE EBOLA!!<//Review>

Took my 87 yr-old mother here for breakfast last Tuesday. I was very disappointed. The denver omelette was very greasy not to mention that it had very few cubes of ham. The hashbrown they served my Mom was burnt so she hardly touched them. Will likely not visit this place again in the future.<//Text>

I always have a hearty breakfast here when I visit them.  My favorites are the chicken and pancakes A(waffles for waffle lovers) and the Texas chili omelet, so stop by for a cup of coffee and a great meal.<//text>

I have 3 stars because I think it could have been better all around. My son had a dentist appointment across the lot so aftwards we stopped in for breakfast. I looked the shop up on Google before we went. Just to read some reviews, menu prices and such. The prices were good, not too expensive. Once we grabbed a seat and got our menus,  the prices were off, by a couple dollars,  online it read prices around $5-6 a plate, the actual prices were around $8-9!. The waitress was very cold with her greeting and mannerisms. She only came by once to see if everything was ok. And they didn't have a lot of what we were wanting to order. My son wanted a strawberry waffle with vanilla ice cream and a chocolate milk. But they didn't have any ice cream nor chocolate milk.  He ended up with a regular waffle with strawberries and whip cream with a hot chocolate (mind you, here in central California it's 105° today).  I ordered the waffle combo. (1 waffle, 2 eggs and 3 sausage links) and an iced tea. I ordered the eggs scrambled, they came to the table cold with the sausage that looked burnt. My bill came to $49.81! The only time the waitress was polite was when I was paying the bill. I don't think we will be going back there. It really was not worth $49 for my 14 year old and myself. Especially since we couldn't get what we really wanted to eat. Needless to say,  I did not leave a tip.<//text>

<Text>The food is amazing... But ... The service I received personally was not good at all, the take out process is very choatic and unorganized, I was literally standing around for about 10 minutes before I was asked to take my order. (I guess they were too busy with the customers who dined in) as I stood and waited the 15 minutes for my order I was ignorantly bumped into by one of the workers there with the curly hair; she failed to say excuse me (guess she was busy working) the lady that  took my order, finally  blessed me with my precious meal :) I was doing this review during my awful wait. The lady that helped me was nice and I was pleased about that. So this isn't a toally bad review, and I am am obviously a black man so I won't play the race card. But I tell you what when I got home the food sure was good. Meal: 27.98 And with every bite I slowly shriveled up my pride to press that third star.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
Very bad experience. All the boother were empty but still had food on the tables. The waitress was forgetful and rude in some ways. The salad was full of brown lettuce. The  waiter who looks young with dark hair looks like he doesn't care about his job. Was on his phone a lot of the time and had an attitude towards the waitress.... Never again....<//Review>

I ordered 3 eggs they gave me 2 , and they were cold . The bacon was old and reheated. The hash browns were mushy because they were soaked in to much grease . Never eat there again!!!!!<//text>
