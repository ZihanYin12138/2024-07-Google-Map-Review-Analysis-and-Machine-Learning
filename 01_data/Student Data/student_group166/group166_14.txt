Good bowling alley, play here all the time. 4 out of 5 because no music plays during league play. Service and wait staff are great. Lanes are good too.<//Text>

<Name>will j<//Name><Time>1509571989319</Time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Arrived at 730pm on a Tuesday night to celebrate my birthday with my friends. Was told because it was league night, we would have to wait til 9pm. So that's what we did. Waited patiently until 9pm. 9pm hit and we began to see lanes open. Followed up with the Caucasian man at the register and was told to wait some more. At 9:25pm, we were finally called upon. I told the sir that I had a group of at least 8 with me and that we would be paying separately. And so, we did just that. As my friends were in line to pay, I began to add the names of the people paying. I soon received news that the person behind the counter had a problem with me adding names prior to payment.  Now,  I get it,  pay before you play, but I was setting names prior to us playing. He then started to give us an attitude along with bad customer service for nearly a good 10 minutes (If you've ever been into any kind of argument or dispute with anyone that long with a person providing customer service, that really is a problem). I'm not sure if he had a problem with my friends because of the color of their skin because they were black, but he really gave my friends and colleagues a hard time. My friend, who's a manager, wanted to speak with the manager, and so she did. This sir was also black skinned so then I thought maybe she'd get better service from him. But no, nothing was done. Not even a apology. Me and a few of my friends who got a chance to play had to finish two games without the rest of our colleagues. There was very much DISSATISFACTION, IRRITATION, & DISGUST in the air due to their bad customer service. I will NEVER return to a place that treats people the way they did. I would give 0 zero stars because this place doesn't deserve even ONE.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>LANES ARE ALWAYS BREAKING DOWN!): If it wasn't for that, this place would get a 5star. One of their Bar tenders Debbie is AMAZING! Great at what she does, and seriously her smiley face and upbeat attitude was a breath of fresh air...especially from a bowling alley bar! Their food is meh....and seriously over priced.</review>< Time>

Parking lot very dark as I noticed several lights on the side of the building were not working. Had a few drinks at the bar, good service there. Restrooms were very messy with paper on the floor and looked as if it had been unattended for some time. Floor in bowling area sticky with spilled drink that had dried without being cleaned.< /text>

Not So Good
I am a league bowler for more that 50 years. I would not recommend this house for league bowling. The PA system has been broke since we started 10 weeks ago. It sounds so bad that it is difficult to concentrate. The only speaker that works is on lane 29 and 30. It is so loud that it is just annoying. The oil machine does not seem to working properly. By the time that it reaches the of the lanes there is no oil on the lane.
They let kids bowl on lanes 31 and 32 are the are constantly running through the bowling area. The seating is not enough for a complete team of four to sit in the bowling area so congestion is very difficult. The back area where tables and chairs to exist are never clean so if you wish to sit there you must first bus your own table.
The management staff is friendly enough but unresponsive to our concerns. I do believe that a large part of the problem is directed from corporate higher ups. I will not return to this house.</Review>

This place  is the best they will get your number ported right away and have you walking out of there with service. I really like this location and prefer it over the big stores. The area is nice around a lot of food spots and stores. You feel right at home and not like your at a car dealership. Highly recommend. The service is great too, i feel like its way better than AT&T. 5 stars for this store!!< /text>

Be careful a $25 restock fee will be charged when return, even the box not being open after 1 day.  What a shame.

This authorized agent didn't follow the rule of Cricket states in their web.
"A fee of up to $25 may be applied (except where prohibited) when a device purchased at a Cricket Store is returned without all of the original components. For example, if the device is missing the battery, battery door, charging transformer, or charging cable, the store will apply this fee."<//Text>

< Review>
All staff especially the Manager very helpful. She actually lent me a phone while my phone was broken. She packaged my broken phone that was still under warranty to send it back to cricket for replacement. She called me a couple weeks later to follow up and see if I have received my replacement phone. Very friendly. I'm planning to take my friends there to get their service switched over to cricket wireless< /Review>

I don't want anyone else to find out about this gem of a gym but they deserve the positive review! The equipment is new, the staff is friendly, and the crowd is manageable! As a former 24 hour fitness member I can confidently say Fitness 19 is a breath of fresh air. The Hayward facility is a bit small but has every piece of equipment you need to hit all the standard lifts you need!< /Review>

They state that they will only charge $14.99 per month, but charged me $155 for one month after re-opening. They also make it impossible for you to leave the membership. With so many other gyms, I wouldn’t waste my time here.< /review>

<review>Newly remodeled since December 2019. Great staff. Not busy when I go in the evenings. Lots of machines, a few already need maintenance though. But overall good local spot for a neighborhood gym. Not super pricey like 24 hour fitness.<//review>< rate>

Tonight's place it's a little place but for the size it's pretty cool it would be nice if they had a couple of more machines but they do have everything you need in order to do a full body workout I like the atmosphere the people are really nice and it is a very clean and elegant place</review>

Your customer service is awful. I have written to your billing company regarding reversal of charges due to Covid-19. I was hit with a $49.99 fee in addition to my monthly fees in a month your gym is CLOSED. This is bad business and I want my membership terminated and wrote to my local gym. I have received no reply, the charges have not been reversed and no contact has been made. I'm guessing this review won't be addressed or even posted.<//Text>

I'm a new member.  When I purchased my membership an appointment with a trainer was setup to introduce me to the gym and to get a body composition assessment.  On the day that I visited with my trainer he was too busy talking about how he has clients that are losing 10-20 pounds weekly when following his plan.  Well as great as that sounds I've been on this planet long enough to know that this is not that healthy and is not good long term.  During our trip around the gym he took me into the class room and wanted to show me exercises I could do at home.  Well some exercises I couldn't do because I have arthritis.  This revelation through him off course so he was done showing me exercises and proceeded to take me back to the front to discuss how many sessions I should buy with him.  I told him I'd think about it.   2 weeks later my son has had the same visit with a trainer.   My son's trainer did a complete assessment which included a history of illnesses, pains or injury.  Asked about current ailments.  He then took my son around the gym and introduced him to the different machines.  He then told my son he'd like to train him but needed to get his mothers permission first.   I think the gym is great but the trainers are not consistent and they should be.  I don't care if you have a client losing 10-20 pounds a week and please don't tell me this to lure me in.  I've been back to exercise maybe a few times.  My son meets with his trainer 2x a week and loves it.  We've seen great progress and he's gone down 2 pants sizes.    I'd love to give more stars but I didn't have the greatest experience here.<//text>

<Review>They opened this new fitness center to replace an old one on Mission blv. They move some of the old equipment here and also got a lot of brand new stuff, such as 2 squat racks, mini football field, extra room for classes, 2 hydro massage chairs. They also have nice clean locker rooms with showers. The occupancy is 196 people, so I hope it won't be crowded in the evening.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating><date>1558368619572<//date><UserId.>111831819855656776135</UserId.><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

It was my first time there. What a great place to eat and hang with friends. The staff could not be more attentive and engaging. Very pleasant and courteous.  We had the shrimp kabob (large shrimp marinated to perfection, fried and served over the perfect rice)the whitefish kabob ( marinated with saffron and other spices), the salmon kabob (grilled with seasoning)and the soltani. We also had the house doogh, regular doogh, tea. The Sophia desert was out of this world. Never had something like it). It was a great night.< /Text>

I had their lunch special today ( juicy chicken).  It was delicious.  Also the owner (gentleman) is very polite and professional.

<Time>1552169366428<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>I heard about Sadaf restaurant with new ownership and decided to try it. I went on Friday with friends, and we test fresh food with excellent service. I am also attaching a few pics of food, restaurant, and menu. Two suggestions for a new owner, (1) Please serve hot sauce, (2) Please add a pic of dishes in the menu list (It will help for a new customer to choose.)
I would recommend to try the Sadaf restaurant with a new owner. I hope You will enjoy Persian food.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJjkiqAyrWQR1bDiCfG2WSlrZ5tcR4ROG06jwS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtqsrmikt7KijOYqxWlnsI-0GN0tqJzG9utokO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-ZzaQGNSuZq0uPiaEl8pR4tENmegYjlVhlqf_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOM1BdL1gln9ykUrgNmiGWmpyw9EQ_T8P9SYzP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbvFvqAqzgerDO8ruHr5sHltKREEVqK9nMhS12=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJerKm_MtsgmxZ0MKvIFmAd_i60rkvj6DsYxFm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9kmBf1zH290Hfh63WjtctxkbA6bmcH9tapHP_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu_6m8Z8WMyLMvt3hoP9oYhWdpsH36uKUBnXXq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMukTyrtZlL-CYzWy8dsBxBjdgFu2mr3LuHRXFj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnjZa4ynTTEt0sWgFvnYi2NbsfPmHnHx6MGW0C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXSPzDzZF1MzAiZOrZx3txj2JJusWN2IiQgn0L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYSPg2wQlVP6UDUymCZhSOGa8_Ib4gB9Kq7dPk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrV-beAa5CReMaek94lkexPy2huKefxbO6oDGP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhaL7g_zFA489UgAYAtcyVtBJr7sY_ejM3qvYQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8rDhk2bGKznVfvo84ujrrsSYZ99MTBbk-XvTB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6YdkvZWDm-W_z2ZoafFNQ80R_D9uxWdg6hIdK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmxXTZ4hdj6amwO0WTCpXyHRSEIftcHS2dGHsc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1552240573456, 'text': 'Thank you Arjun for your review and the beautiful pictures you took!

I decided to stop by after I heard there was new ownership. What a great move that was.

The level of service topped with the delicious food left me satisfied and yearning for more. I'm Persian and  I'm taking picky when it comes to comparing what I get from my mom under our family's roof. They definitely have my mom a run for her money. The kabob combination was delightful and the service was warming. We will make this a routine stop from now on.< /review>

Delicious! Always full of people but still manage quick service. Have been here a number of times now and have never had a less than excellent meal or experience. Always recommend it to my friends who are on or near the Disney lot.<//review>

Their chicken, beef and fish entrees are very flavorful and plentiful. You can upgrade on variety of prepared rice.  They have happy hour with $5 plates, my favorite is the chicken lohem which is pretty much a lavash   chicken tender taco with onion, sumac, tomato and their sauce. Their dessert menu varies from a light sweet bite to decadent. On the weekends they have live music, that can be a bit loud for the size of the place. Staff are extremely friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. The facilities are clean and plenty of free parking in the rear.<//Review>< Name>

<review>I have no idea how this restaurant has a high rating.  Either people don't know what Persian food should really taste like, or something is definitely  wrong with their taste.  God bless all nationalities who work in this kitchen but Persian food in particular should only be prepared by an Iranian lady.  I have given this place few chances, but unfortunately I am done.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1569503931536, 'text': 'Hi Ray, thank you for your review.

NEW WITH MANAGEMENT THEY MUST BE BETTER. I TRIED SABZI POLO WITH WHITE FISH, IT WAS EXCELLENT. PERSON TAKING ORDER FOR TAKEOUT WAS VERY SLOW AND I HAD TO REPEAT 3 TIMES FOR EACH ORDER, NEED MORE IMPROVEMENT IN THAT AREA. FOOD WAS SUPERB. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE.

The Conejo Valley offers so much that one rarely has to leave.  But the area has a dearth of Persian restaurants. Luckily for us, we have Sadaf.

Their menu has so many diverse Persian dishes yet it's easy to navigate (tip: ask the friendly waiter for recommendations).  Tahdig, lentil soup, dolmeh, hummus, shirazi salad, polo dishes (flavored rice with chicken/lamb/beek), stwes and chicken/beef kabobs and koobidehs are all amazing.  There isn't anything on the menu that isn't 5-star quality and taste.

My favorite dish is the chicken koobideh.  It's seasoned ground chicken, cooked on a skewer on a charcoal grill.  It is amazingly juicy and delicious.

Service is fast and very friendly.  Don't let the white linens fool you: it's elegant but easy on the wallet. Lunch entrees are around $11. Dinners are $16+.<//text>

You'd think with a limited menu, and a sign that says two hour limit, that they could get organized enough to feed us before their self-imposed time limit expires.   The food is good, but it is about the same as any middle eastern restaurant.  So, was it worth it?  Nah.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>First time visit..Really blown away by the decor, the ambience and setup. Food was excellent with great collection of appetizers (vegetarian and otherwise)..Kids had fish/chicken, wifey and I had vegetarian stuff.. really impressive.. best part was the Zoolbia and Bamieh? Nice place.. would love to go again..Suggest that service improve a bit to ensure appetizers come together (our combo appetizer order came early but falafels took 4ever)!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80e83bb360027901:0x870dd79cb42f8294<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>A good value and great service. Not too busy on a weeknight. Food was tasty and portions were big. I recommend the fesenjun and gormeh sabzi. Baghali polo could have been better with more lima beans in the rice, but the lamb shank was cooked perfectly. Would have liked some onion or herbs with the complimentary lavash as is the case at other places.<//Text>< Pics>

Awesome food, excellent service. This one is second Sadaf restaurant and it is as good or better than the original on Ventura BLVD.< /Text>

We went there for  Mother's day.  I had been to their Encino location and wanted to try their new location.  I think the food was very good (Just as good as their Encino location).   We were 8 people and everyone liked their food.< /review>

<Text>I dunno where to start.......I ordered the chicken kabob and, FOR SURE, my food was definitely reheated in a microwave before served to me. Every extra side was $1 extra (hummus, greek salad, or whatever you want). Every good place I've gone to has these sides already included AND cheaper, like Mediterranean Pita in Westlake or Calabasas or Soom Soom in Westlake. I also had to literally flag down my server for the bill. All bad. And a $7 stella. :(</Text></record>

The beef shish kebab and kubideh are really good and should be enjoyed with their house dips and pita bread.  Also try their icecream.  They serve authentic Persian dishes.< /Review>

<gmap_id>0x80dcd1dac8d5c96f:0xf90202197ae486b3<//gmap_id><Text>Our Maserati dealership in Bakersfield closed so we went to Maserati of Anaheim Hills. This is our third car so we are pretty familiar with the brand. We were helped by Jason Liu. This experience was nothing short of outstanding. Jason showed up 30 minutes early and was very accommodating. He understood we drove 3 hours and got us back on the road quickly while not lessening the quality of the visit. He is very knowledgeable and honest.

We love Maserati of Anaheim Hills and will definitely be back!<//Text><name>Fred Robledo< /name>< UserId.>

<review>I don't  know about  sells but service  is not a standard compare to other dealers,  no one care about  calling back to customer after I left too many massages and too many time
Evan service manager Paul, same way too, Chris never answered  his phone or replied back to massages,  Tom is same way too, I am not happy  with service at all , I don't  give negative reviews unless  is very bad service,  I would  say take your car somewhere else  to repair,  good luck !< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF5pusFbGKW7aIgkZcEkdO6zuxDqMQ8-aC-E3K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3YmxUP4Hr1_a76IrQNNrUj8fy4pgCv0mwjld2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<review>I heard Maserati is a worst car brand to own. I still purchased it. Experienced somewhat of a fun driving and the worst customer experience. Management! You need to scout a customer service team from Hyundai or other economic brands. Don't even aim for Benz or BMW yet.
You need to realize the reason why Maserati dealerships are disappearing.
Otherwise, your location is next to be gone.
Take my advice seriously.
Nothing can be done in a single visit.
Value your customer's time.
Stop telling me to come again!< /review>< rating>

<review>By far the best experience I’ve ever had purchasing a car. Mauricio and Jason were straightforward and very helpful.  I never once felt like they were hiding anything. Both went above and beyond to help us with any questions and requests that we had. Would 100% come back here again for any future auto purchases!! (FYI we bought a Tacoma at a Maserati dealership - they have a wide range of options and you won’t be limited to just maseratis).</review>< Pictures>

Jason gave me a great price and customer service on a 2018 Giulia.
They are no bs here like other dealers where they try to tack on $3,000-5,000 add ons after discussing a different price online or on the phone. Highly recommend this dealer.</Text>

I just bought a used truck from Mauricio & Jason and by far, the best dealership experience I've ever had.  We went in to test drive a vehicle and ended up buying it on the spot.

I saw their listing on Autotrader late at night, went to their official website and set up a test drive appointment.  The next morning within 20 mins of opening, I get a call from Jason confirming the appointment and 10 mins after, Mauricio texted me to coordinate any of my requests.

Came in, the vehicle was ready and clean.  No issues with the test drive and when we talked numbers.  WOW!  Jason and Mauricio were soooo transparent and educated us on some of the sleazy moves other dealerships would try to do to get more money out of the buyers.  Sure enough, those advices were negative comments I've read for other sleazy dealerships in Orange County.

After the sale, Mauricio followed up a couple days later to make sure we were satisfied with the purchase.  I noticed a smudge in the engine bay and Mauricio offered to detail the vehicle again.

Overall...great experience and service.  Definitely would come back to purchase another vehicle.< /text>

<text>I got my second Maserati here at Maserati of Anaheim hills and would definitely recommend to all my friends. Jason knows the car very well and patient to all clients. He  understood what you needs and picked the car you want. He won't push if you don't really into it. The procedure is extremely efficient, saving time for both of us.

This is the second car I have leased from Maserati of Anaheim Hills and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a Maserati.  Unlike some of their competitors I have worked with, their focus is customer service, knowledge of the cars and they are just nice people to work with - especially Jason.   He  went above and beyond to make it easy and safe for me to test drive a car - he was super straightforward about the numbers, explained everything in great detail, and patiently answered all my questions - so ultimately I felt very comfortable about making the deal.   I am so very happy with my car and the amazing customer service I have received and still receive make me love it even more.</Review>

Look for Bree in Sales if you want a great deal on a great car. She is professional and very communicative, and my car buying process was seamless. Yannick in Service, as well as the rest of the Service team always go the extra mile to make sure that my car is in perfect shape before I pick it up. I could not be more impressed with the Service team at Maserati of Anaheim Hills; they really have a stellar team over there, and they're definitely the best I've ever dealt with. It comes together with great management as well; shout out to Jason for taking care of me and following up even months after I bought my car and making sure I was happy with it. When you're a customer here, they really treat you like family.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is my 3 car I’ve purchased  at  Maserati Anaheim hills.  Jason has been my sales person for all 3 vehicles he is so on top of everything he’s very patient let’s you take your time to decide what you like (I’m very picky) he never rushes me and most of all he will give you the very best deal! I will always buy my cars from Jason.  If your in the market for a Maserati or Alpha Romeo no need to shop any place else.  Jason will give you the best price and customer service!!!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Just bought our second Maserati at this place and both experiences were exceptional! Everyone that we spoke to and worked out a deal with were professional, listened closely to what we were looking for and went out of their way to make our purchase possible.

Very bad service!! It’s sad I have to give them one star to leave a review.  On a scale between 1 and 10 I would rate them a minus 13!! Horrible service I have ever received. Took my 2016 Ghibli in four times and they never found the issue, how convenient! I feel they are waiting for my warranty to expire then after it expires they will finally find the issue to my car and charge an arm and a leg for the repairs.  Every time I called and left a message for a call back or appointment It took several days until my call was returned. Their technicians are incompetent and it’s sad because they have the nicest and luxurious cars. If you want to keep your nice Maserati in good condition, go to a real Maserati dealership not a Dodge dealership like this one. 👎☹️< /Text>

They played a lot of games on the contract.

I purchased a used car (2018) model in October 2019. The car already has a factory bumper-to-bumper warranty that expires in 2022.

I also purchased a 6-year warranty extension. However I found from the App that says the “extension” started when the car is first “in-service” in 2018, and expires in 2024!

The financial manager DID NOT tell me the expiration time at all when I sign the contract.

Imagine you bought a 6-year-old car from them with 6 year warranty extension, and the extension expires as soon as you get the car! Why would you pay this for the previous owners if you were told when you sign the contract?

From google, every single website says the warranty extension starts when the factory warranty expires. In this sense, my warranty extension should start in 2022, and expires in 2028.

I contacted them, and the financial manager said “It’s an alfa romeo, it’s like a Ferrari, so you cannot get a 6 year warranty extension for this cheap. And every company in the industry do things this way”.

Does it make any sense to you? To me, it’s the same as: “It’s not a cheap car, so I can play games on the numbers.”

Disappointed. And will find a lawyer to sue them.</text>

< Review>
went over there on Friday 04/19/2019 to get a code for my radio after I had called over the phone and they said I must bring in my car to get the code and it would be free of charge and they have all codes in system. When I got there a service advisor I believe " Gary"  tried to rip me off, saying they have to plug in car to scanner and takes over 1 1/2 hour to retrieve code and cost $385, which is not true.
on the other,  would like to thank Robert for stepping in, got on his phone. walked up to my car, and got the code in less than 2 minutes . Thank you Robert, you are a Five-Stars rating.< /Review>

This place was awesome to visit! We bought our Maserati from Jake & Amy; no problems at all. We came in last week for a service concern. Cary in the service department was able to take me in without an appointment. He was very helpful and understanding of our concern. Lucky for us, all it needed was a software update from the factory. I was out within an hour or so. The service manager Paul came out and introduced himself, he too was very helpful. He took my car and had an express detail done on it while Cary was doing my paper work/invoice. I'll be returning for all my service needs for sure. BTW, they have a huge range of exotic cars on display.<//Review>

This is the worst dealership for service.  We bought a service contract when we purchased our car.  However, when we called for a service appointment and asked for a loner car and booked our service.  When we reached to drop the car no loner was available and no apologies.  Left a message for the service manager and now 2 weeks later no one called.  Saw a review on Yelp similar to mine and someone suggested to try Puente Hills Maserati and they honored my contract and they were great.</review>

No high pressure sales tactics and while some dealers are still the the stone age and won't deal with you over the phone/email Jake and Natalie were awesome and gave me exact numbers and gave me an awesome deal without all the hassle. I didn't have a ride out to them initially so they actually offered to pay for the Uber trip out to then to pick up the car. I literally spent less than an hour reading/writing emails to negotiate the deal. And less then 1 hour at the dealership and some of that was my fault because my bank had to lift a spending limit on my debit card.

Highly recommend getting your ride here! Thanks guys, I love my new car.< /Text>

Service is so bad. Ask them to patch the tire.. instead they plugged it like gas station repair shop.. So I had to go back to my tire shop to get proper repair.. The service department looks very ghetto and do not provide loaner. They want to charge me 10k just for a few bushings. I will not come back if I don't have to.<//review>

Service sucked. I was working with a service advisor that was let go. He was working on various tasks for me and the effort was never transferred after he was fired. After 3 weeks finally called to find out nothing had been done. When I purchased my vehicle I asked and was told that a loner would be available anytime my vehicle was brought in for service. When I arrived I was told that they do not provide loaners for scheduled maintenance. I have more but will stop here.< /review>

<Text>Maserati of Anaheim Hills was a pleasure to work with. I called three different dealedships and Anaheim Hills was the only one that returned my calls.  The Sales team worked with me to find the right car for me.  Love, love, love my Ghibli SQ4.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>If AJ texts you near the end of your lease and says “Come on in and we will take care of everything”, he is not kidding. He hooked me up with my second new Jstar quattroporte. Jake was easy to work with and Dean in finance is awesome. They are a great team.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Very bad service that I never ever had the same with any other dealer in Orange Country.
Do not even  bother yourself.  I can’t believe that they still in business.</text>

<review>Wish I could give them negative stars. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE AT ALL COSTS! We dropped our car off there for an "end of term" inspection and for them to fix the recalls on our vehicle before we bought it out. Not only did they return our car to us dirty, but with a HUGE crack in our windshield that they REFUSE to take responsibility for. Truly unbelievable. I can't possibly imagine how a business functions with such little honesty and integrity. The service manager, Paul Ortega, has been so rude and disrespectful and has done nothing to fix what THEY DID.
(Update)
After going back and forth with Paul Ortega to get my windshield fixed, I got nowhere. He told me that there was no "point of contact" on the windshield and I could not prove that they had done it, so they weren't at fault. Not only was he rude and extremely unprofessional, he lied to my face because he knew the windshield had cracked while at their facility.

We were getting nowhere with Paul, so I finally asked to speak to someone else who could actually help me and that is when Rocky came out. He calmly walked over, inspected my windshield, and told me that since there was NO "point of contact" it mostly likely was caused from stress... like heat for example. And since our car had been sitting in the sun for almost 3 weeks (because their service representative failed to call us back after calling THREE times to schedule a pick up) that was most likely the cause. I continued to explain how the car was returned to us dirty and certain things weren't fixed. Rocky apologized and said it was no problem and he will take care of it.

I literally spent two days going back and forth with Paul in which he REFUSED to help me.  Rocky came out, and in under 10 minutes resolved the entire issue.

The next day I got a call from Paul Ortega asking me to take my reviews down... and he told me that my windshield will get replaced sooner if I do so. I did not quite understand why.... he said it was a part of some customer program thing and if I take the reviews down they can use a windshield that was readily available... but if I don't.. then he has to order one and it will take longer. I'm not exactly sure but it made absolutely no sense. So I called Rocky after, to clarify the conversation I had with Paul and he was unaware that Paul had even called me, but assured me that everything was being taken care of and that my windshield had already been replaced.

I ended up taking one review down (on Google but left the Yelp one up) and over the next few days Paul called me multiple times leaving voicemails asking me to take the other review down.... which honestly made me feel like I was being harassed.

It was just a terrible experience that I thought would never end. Even though Rocky was very helpful and he was able to resolve the issue, my experience with Paul was so bad that nothing could be done at that point to change my mind. I still only give this place 1 star and will never take my car there again just for the fact that Paul Ortega works there.<//review><time>1502325838007</time><user_name>Markie Collins<//user_name><Response>None</Response><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>1< /rating><userid>100285492702910313114<//userid>< GmapID>

This place randomly popped up this semester and I enjoy coming here for the fist time last week. Their fish is very fresh and their servings are definitely generous.</review>

This isn't your average poke place. "Chirashi" is a Japanese word meaning scattered, and unlike other poke places that serve a bowl of rice and little portioned scoops of last night's salmon, Chirashi by Mr. 7 arranges your fresh slices of fish in a fanned out display. The way their food is served reflects the overall attitude of this place: attention to detail.

The ingredients in the bowls are presented in a way that highlights every individual piece of fish while still maintaining that cohesive poke bowl image. Each piece is carefully portioned out and strategically placed on top of a bed of sushi rice. Now, I don't think of myself as a sushi connoisseur, but I've had my fair share of fish, and I've grown accustomed to what I think is "good fish." And this place has GOOD FISH. The salmon is fresh, not too fishy, with a buttery texture. The Ahi Tuna is perfectly seared, lightly salted, and absolutely tender. Even the spicy tuna, which is usually regarded as a cheap filling for California rolls, is given the special treatment, with a subtle spicy flavor and an inexplicably creamy texture that appears to have little to no mayo used.

The sides are more understated, but are by no means underwhelming. The guacamole is insanely good (I doubled my portion) with a bright flavor and smooth texture that was pleasantly interrupted with diced red onion and tomato. This guacamole is very complimentary to the fresh flavors of the fish and doesn't feel out of place, unlike other poke places. The rest of the sides are well executed and taste fresh (crab meat, edamame, seaweed) but I really like that guacamole, if it wasn't clear.

Chirashi by Mr. 7 also looks INCREDIBLE. It's located across the street from Mt. San Antonio College, in a shopping center with affordable Asian restaurants and fast food places. But this place has extremely clean, refined decor featuring soft white LED bars and strips of pale birch wood that give the restaurant an extremely clean, modern aesthetic. Food should always be at the center of what makes a restaurant great, but the dining experience counts for something, and Chirashi by Mr. 7 hits the nail on the head by offering a unique environment that's trendy and cozy.

Google doesn't let me take off half a star, but my only grievance with this restaurant doesn't warrant the removal of a full star. That grievance is the price. It's pricey, which is an interesting move. College students are notoriously broke, and many of them (myself included) might walk in, see the price, and walk right back out. Let me explain why it's expensive, from my point of view. This isn't meant to be an affordable haven for starved, broke students who want a quick bite between classes. Chirashi by Mr. 7 is meant to be a dining experience, one that uses only the freshest and most flavorful ingredients, one that offers a premium eating environment, and one that doesn't leave you feeling like you blew the last of your paycheck on some rice in a bowl with raw fish on top.

If you're like me and you enjoy quality sushi, you MUST give this place a try. It's a decision that will turn a one time visit into a weekly ritual, and although your wallet won't be thanking you for it, your taste buds will.<//review>

The only thing is the sashimi was a little warm when serving.  That just made me a little worried about the freshness during the hot weather.  However everything else was great!!<//Review>< Pics>

Appalling service. The new electronic order system was making everything complicated.

It was easy to use and we put the order in quickly. Staff really messed up, though. Took 20 minutes to make the Sushi burrito when previously it took no more than 5 minutes. Lady mixed up orders completely and just stood around dumbfounded instead of actively trying to fix it. We had to point out to the lady which one was our correct order because she couldn't figure it out. This was even though every ingredient of the order was printed on the receipt.

Awful. Not going back until they fix their service. I should have complained for my money back since their mess up made us late for class.<//Review>

When this was the Chirashi place it was pretty good, now it is a Poke spot but their sauces choice just dont work for me. Even PokeCeviche down the street is better (and that one is okay at best). They took a great spot and re-branded to something terrible.</Review>

Select what you want, customize your order, swipe your card, take a number and take a seat. They also have a section where you can get your own water and sauces.
Nice place to go if you're wanting a quick bite and not wanting to pay the big bucks for a fancy chirashi bowl. I'd definitely come back.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>+ Fresh fish
+ Sushi Rice
+ Big selection of toppings you'd find in a Chirashi bowl
+ Good sauces
+ Big portions

- Spicy mayo and creamy sesame sauce was kept near window. There was an reusable icepack in the container but it was warm to the touch, so was the spicy mayo.

I was initially a bit skeptical coming to this place, but I thoroughly enjoyed the food. The restaurant is pretty large and has plenty of seating. I liked that they had sushi rice, to be expected in a Chiriashi bowl. The fish looked fresh, I had the spicy tuna, spicy salmon, salmon, and tilapia, all tasted fresh. Good selection of toppings. I also really liked that the sauces were self serve on the side. The creamy sauces were kept near the window and we were warm to the touch. I got them to taste, but besides just having a taste didn't want to risk it.</review></record></dataset><record>

13 dollars for 1 bowl, but it comes with 5 proteins/fish, and 5 sides of your choice. I wish to order something without having to use an iPad (you can't ask for a water cup, instead u have to enter "WATER" on the iPad. It prints a receipt for $0)<//text>

If you're looking for fresh raw fish to enjoy, look no further. I've been looking for a casual Japanese restaurant that serves fresh raw fish for a decent price and Mr.7 hit the spot. The chirashi was beautifully arranged and the fish was very fresh. The sushi rice was almost perfect - great authentic flavor, stickiness just right, cooked al dente, but the seasoning just a tad strong: cook with 20% less seasoning to make the rice flavor more subtle. I will choose this place over any poke place because cubed servings of fish does not taste anywhere as fulfilling and wholesome as sliced fish. That being said, my slices of fish were sliced thinner than the thinnest I've had in sushi joints - hence minus 1 star(would have been 2 stars if not for how perfect everything else was). If Mr.7 could slice 2mm thicker and charge a $1 more, I would rate this 5 star and it would honestly be my favorite restaurant. I forgot to mention that the spacious dining area and modern design is inviting and relaxing.</Text>

Awesome place! I love hiking over there! It might be a exhausting hike but it is worth it to get to the top and see the beautiful view from there.<//Text>

One of the most beautiful places I have hiked. The astonishing view of the lakes and mountains make it seem like you are dreaming. It's not a busy trail but the parking lot at the base lake does get crowded very early so plan ahead and get there early.<//Text>

<review>Great hike. My wife and I with two kids under five did this hike 45 years ago. I am 75 years old now and was curious to see how much change has taken place. Wow, the lower lake does not exist and the second lake is no more than a small pond. I may be wrong but I think the second lake is Green Lake.</review><rating>4< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great hikes. Bishop pass/long lake hike is much easier than the treasure lakes hike which shares the same trailhead and splits off about half a mile in. It’s an additional 2.2 miles to treasure lakes (1st lake) on a harder to follow and steep trail. Again, long lake to the left is much easier.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbrnrx0dOGsP9w0PbuBKGhIE5ZprqKOXvzs3Fx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80be25f0ef4ce837:0xe4c907347c7ae3b0<//gmap_id></record>

The lake is still frozen in the middle of April, 90% of the trail covered with the snow. Last 1 mile of the road is “Closed”, but you still can use it. Stunning views and very nice place for camping, hiking and enjoing the nature😍🏔</Review>

Beautiful trail head, with South Lake near by and snow mountains in the background and blue sky. Cool temperature at the altitude of near 10k feet. I wish I could stay there forever</Review>

a great high elevation trailhead to access the sierra.  unfortunately it suffers from overuse and a bit to much horse/mule poop on the trail.</review>

<text>Very scenic with tall snow ladden mountains visible feom the trail head itself. South lake is also right there. It is at quite an elevation and hence can be cold (35F) in the morning with strong winds (June 18, 2018)<//text><user>108482898680890536765< /user></record>

<Date>1611454394380</Date><review>Oh my goodness, I cannot even tell you have a good this food was! The vegetarian combo is actually vegan and got two portions to take to the park with a friend. Everything was so delightful and flavorful but one of the dishes was creamy tomato-based and I’ve been thinking about it for the last couple days! Also, I really appreciate the freshness and quality of the injera. They provided plenty and rolled them up in smaller pieces to make portion control easy. A+</review>< resp>

Food tasted great: fresh and flavorful.. we had the veggie combo plate.

Clean and friendly, and the generous  vegetarian platter fed two, with leftovers. A great price for an amazingly pretty and tasty meal.
Surprise favorite was the beets. I don't usually like them, but these were wonderful. Peas and lentils and injeera were delicious. And the greens were heavenly. Can't wait to go back!<//Review>

<text>Now I'm not familiar with Ethiopian food at all, but seeing the good reviews on Google got me interested. I don't know if what I had wasn't good, but the meal was bland and overtly raw even for a rare. The meat was completely uncooked and just spicy. The customer service was practically out the window as well. The employees spent a lot of the time just talking to each other.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Amazing Ethiopian food. Just food. Not very good at ambiance. But full marks for food. A tad bit spicy but that's how Ethiopian food is made. See lots of locals eating here. Had veggie combo and loved it. My friend ordered chicken tbis and loved it too.< /review>

Yummy spicy Ethiopian food, great value for money, and a very amiable host.

Update: a year later, it's still my go to Ethiopian food place. The food is not fancy or anything but the place has a cozy and homely vibe somehow. Great for takeout, for a casual intimate dinner conversation with your loved ones or a raucous time with friends!</Text>

<Text>Pretty small and decor is a bit tired, but food is legit good Ethiopian and the service is fast and friendly.  Good food wins over pretty objects hanging on the wall any day with me.    Make sure to get your food with Injera (the pancake like thing)<//Text></record>

To be perfectly honest I have had a less than stellar experience with T-mobile as a whole. I was not to happy to find they had bought out my contract with sprint. I even paid off my devices early so I could jump ship as soon as possible. Enter Gilbert Godina and his manager, they spent 4 hours fixing a problem made by t mobile almost 7 years ago. Not in a bid to keep my business but because when they found out what was going on they genuinely cared. I was so impressed I decided to stay after all. All the goodies I bought doesn’t really matter here, what matters is that T mobile should use Mr. Godina as a customer service model, he saved a relationship and made his store a nice sale by being patient kind, and actually caring about the customer. In a world where customers are treated as an inconvenient necessity in order to get money, Gilbert was truly a refreshing change of pace! Thank you Mr. Godina, for listening and fixing a problem that not one person addressed in 7 years.<//Review>

Best Service I could have Asked for. I left AT&T because the Service in there Palm Springs Store was terrible. Leo the Manager of the T-Mobile Store made the Transition very easy. I will tell all my Family and Friends to make the switch to T-Mobile and to go see Leo at the Cathedral City Store!</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I had the most nastiest experience with Sprint on the phone. Just because of them, which includes corporate office, there are those who will pay price simply because others didn't do their job right. And it is this store. I always when had problems ran to this store and painlessly they solved my problem in minutes. Where on the phone I spend for over hour. I am switching to Verizon wireless but not because of this store but because of others who thought that bringing harm is the answer to their mental dilemma. Too bad. But if you ever have any concerns I urge you to come to this store and you will get the most outstanding experience.  But to store all customer service thank you a million and I wish you best of luck< /text>< Pics>

The 5 stars goes to Michael and his relentless efforts to solve an issue where I was dealing with for 5 hours talking to different departments and receiving contradictory information.  You are a great example of customer service 👏 Michael and I hope you train others in ur team, especially people in the back office.<//text>

<text>I just had a horrible customer service experience at this location. I was trying to switch my service to Sprint as a new customer and the employees here act as if they don’t want to provide services or help unless you are buying an expensive device or plan. I was treated horribly because I did not want to pay a $30 fee for switching carriers. I started my application online and fees were waived. I was required by Sprint to finish the process in store and verify my identity in person. After spending an hour in the store, verifying my identity with very personal information, I still left without my new service. I was told that I have to go back online to finish the process myself unless I pay the $30 to do it in the store. Don’t come here unless you want to be a customer with a company that doesn’t care about you and only wants your money.</text>< user>

<review>The customer services at this store is by far some of the worst i have ever had. Just for a simple stock question, to get phones for a upgrade and getting a rude response from the person on the line. Will not be shopping at this store ever again and rather go to the one located in the La Quinta area.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I would give them no stars if i could. I was ready to give up on Sprint entirely because of this store and their management/resolution to issues. The manager, specifically, and the team only cared to keep selling products, instead of telling me accurate information and explain to me what the issues were behind the error message on the screen. He told me to drive back and forth over 3 times between their store, at&t, and T-mobile and told me he would "follow up" but never did over the course of 2 days trying to switch over. Basically, his resolution was "it's not working, sorry there's nothing we can do" and that's it? He made an easy sale/switch a nightmare because he couldn't walk me through something, and brushed me aside because i had originally told him my plan of not purchasing a new phone. Since he had no commission/sales interests in me, why should he bother to help anymore than the bare minimum?

I went to the store on Date Palm drive and talked with Simon and it felt like a complete 180 degree turn in service. He not only told me WHY my phone wasn't working, he also made me comfortable enough to PURCHASE a brand new phone even though i had the iphone X FULLY PAID OFF, with every intention not to pay more than i needed, prior. Guess the manger missed out on some commission for his store after all. Maybe learn to train not only sales, but compassion and understanding, like, basic human courtesy, and the business will follow.  Pretty sad this is a corporate store, honestly. What a terrible example of leadership.</Review>< gmap_id>

Was given wrong information again by the rep. on the chat for sprint so I drove to the store and the free equipment to increase the home phone ability was not even available and may not be for some time. It was also so that you had to be approved to get it.   So it was a completely wasted trip.  I have to wait for a phone call and see if I am approved for a unit that was not in stock but maybe after the phone call next week.  I was also on the rep. chat on my phone for nearly two hours. I did get a plan change but it took two hours on the chat with the rep.  Then two more hours traveling to and from the store.  Poor service from sprint.  The store was quick and helpful so that is the reason i gave a fair score as the women at the store was very helpful.  As for sprints total performance it would be one star.  This is common when I get some phone help usually more than 70% of the information was in correct and they sway on what is a deal and what isn't, like saying you get a $60 amount off my phone payoff so it would be about $150 as I owe near $210 for pay off.  The actual program is if I pay it off the $210 then I would get a monthly $10 payments over a 6 month period back to my account. That is not the same as a payoff of $150 today.  I was told last month I could get a $16+ reduction in my monthly payments if I upgrade and to call back when I was ready to trade up.  In reality it had a expiration ending before I made the call. The store does not have the same problem usually.   The call in reps seem never to be correct about almost every thing.  This has been constant problem with calling customer service!</Text>

< Review>
After being an over 20 year sprint customer I'm shocked and appalled on the way I was treated. I needed to activate my new phone & Once the Store manager realized I had already purchased my new phone from the apple store his tone and demeanor quickly changed & he became very unhelpful. I needed a new sim & the manager acted as if they may not have the sims to activate a new iphone 11 & said that my phone should have came with one. I calmly let him know that the phone was a gift and that the apple store did. It provide a sim. The phone did not come with a sim and that is why I was at the store location. It's just very disheartening that customers are treated this way. Judging by the reviews I guess this is common practice. I will never return to this location again & I may leave sprint all together.< /Review>

Gus Delgado (manager) and Andres Ochoa (technical consultant) went above the call of duty in our recent visit to the Sprint store in Cathedral City.  They were both kind and patient with my elderly father (who we were switching over from ATT), and spent extra time with us to ensure we were completely satisfied.  Thank you Gus and Andres!< /Text>

< review>
My friend is not to tech savvy. He is a sprint customer who had his phone stolen and replaced by insurance. When the phone was shipped it was damaged. He didn't notice the damage until a week after receiving it. We went to the store because they had shut off his service due to being late on his bill. When we got to the store the representative Joseph was so rude. We needed to speak to customer service to see what could be done. Instead of him calling explaining the situation as a customer service representative should do, he dialed the number on his phone and handed the corded handset to my friend. My friend couldn't press the appropriate number to get to the appropriate department. Absolutely horrendous customer service. Don't give Sprint you're hard earned money for overpriced service and rude uneducated employees.</review>

I just wanted to comment because I saw these reviews and was kinda shocked. I have been to the store several times over the last couple of years and have always had a good experience with the staff. They can fix a good deal of issues with the phones right there in about an hour.  When my phone could no longer be fixed they let me use their phone to call my claim into Asurian. I have had two issues. First after my Note 5 was broken and replaced my insurance was cancelled by someone. I never saw a decrease in my bill. No one contacted me. When my replacement phone broke they were unable to fix it and I called in the claim on their phone again. The store clerk asked why I had cancelled my insurance. I said that I had not. Luckily the replacement phone was still under warranty so it was not an issue and there was no deductible to pay. However my phone did not arrive the next day as I was told it would. I found an email asking me to call with my claim number. They had cancelled my claim and were very rude and condescending on the phone. The lady left me on hold. After an hour and ten minutes U hung up. A month later I called back and spoke with a supervisor whi apologized and processed my order right away. I now have a Lg G7 Thinq instead of a galaxy note 5. I am happy because it is brand new and has 64 of memory and the snapdragon processor.< /review>

<Review>My friend is not to tech savvy. He is a sprint customer who had his phone stolen and replaced by insurance. When the phone was shipped it was damaged. He didn't notice the damage until a week after receiving it. We went to the store because they had shut off his service due to being late on his bill. When we got to the store the representative Joseph was so rude. We needed to speak to customer service to see what could be done. Instead of him calling explaining the situation as a customer service representative should do, he dialed the number on his phone and handed the corded handset to my friend. My friend couldn't press the appropriate number to get to the appropriate department. Absolutely horrendous customer service. Don't give Sprint you're hard earned money for overpriced service and rude uneducated employees.< /Review>< pics>

This store must be closed. Im sure a lawsuit is coming their way.  They are not upfront and honest with their costumers and have terrible costumer service skills. I would recommend for you to go to a different location or  not do business with Sprint at all. Vanessa, one of the store managers hid fee information from us, which later caused that amount (which we were never made aware of) go into collections. If you care about your credit, sprint is the worst to make business with. Save your safe hundreds of dollars of fees and go with straight talk or other month to month retailers.<//Review>

i had such a bad experinece at this location! I had gone to the store in Palm Desert previously to ask for prices and they gave me a quote for 200 dlls ! they had already looked into my account and that was the price! i just didn't want to drive all the way back when the Palm Springs location seemed a lot more convinient! I talked to the lady in this store for no more than 5 minutes! she never even got to scanning the phone that i wanted to tell me if i even had to give a down payment for the phone or anything she just told me that it was going to be 300 dlls ! assumming i had to give a down payment & telling me different fees ! i told her i was given a different number and she just said well i dont know where they are getting their numbers from ! i had to drive all the way to palm desert because this lady just didn't do her job & she did not want to take her time to do a good job either! ended up driving a lot further but i ended up paying 200 dlls as i was told with a second line & with a lower monthly payment! this lady just doesn't know what customer service is neither wants to take the time to help customers! bad customer service</Text>

I went in to get my battery replaced, they guy ripped a ribbon connector in my phone and blamed it on the guy who replaced my display, front camera, and speaker doesn't work anymore, then he proceeds to make me feel bad for myself because i was a younger teen, he also left out a bunch of screws out of my iPhone, honestly a terrible experience, I bet the guy wasn't even a trained technician, i hope the people at sprint see this and fire the guy.<//text>

< Review>
As always Brandon's Diner came through with a great meal. As everything starts to open up and having slowly bringing back dine in the work everyone has to do is amazing. The carnitas plate was amazing the meat was crispy and moist the side of beans was tasty and the flour tortillas was perfect to complete the meal. Also ordered was two crispy beef tacos with no lettuce when I opened the box not only did they complete the order properly but they loaded the tacos with plenty of cheese which made my day. Thank you to the staff of Brandon's for the continued great work.</Review>

It was canned small pieces of Chile mixed with eggs to make the omelet. The omelet didn't set as it was watery. The avocado was chunked in large pieces and thrown into the middle of the omelet. About half way of trying cut up the avocado and trying to keep the omelet on the fork, I pressed into the omelet and white substance started pouring out. It was sour cream. There was too much to get out of the omelet and I stopped eating it.

Just a suggestion:
I would have liked an egg omelet with the Chile and cheese inside with sliced avocado and sour cream on top instead of mixed or cooked inside.

The cashier was nice and apologized for the omelet. The total bill for 2 people $48. I felt ripped off.

Found out that I was charged for someone else's steak breakfast.

My partner called and they told him to call after 3pm when a manager would be on-site.

Called at 3pm and the lady that was cashier said she remember me (no manager onsite). I told her about the charge and she remembered me complaining about the nasty omelet.

She said she would have cash waiting for pickup at the front for the steak breakfast $15.95. She left $16 at the register not the $15.95 plus tax. Said she would give us 20% discount when we came back. That's if we decide to come back.

I understand the pandemic has affected businesses and I'm more than willing to accept mediocre food and semi-decent service. The place wasn't packed this Brandoms should hire a manager to help the waitresses and host. 6 waitresses and the host upfront talking chisme. Patrons don't need to be waiving people down to get a refill of coffee or the check.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNloNk1czYtZa4Tqs1Jz7BztFfQWrqOixX-OWjD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMc7ILN5Kmsh7RwCN4B5oBfSlgVqq9Yojshu8i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Talk about a lot of food. The flapjacks I ordered wouldn't even fit on the plate they brought it out on. Which is great but the food is just okay. Sausage tastes like I was eating it with the store bought wrapper on it. I ordered over easy and got over medium. Plus the eggs were just okay. The water that came out must have been tap water. Flapjacks we're good though. Also it's a lot of food so that's a major plus, but I wouldn't come here for brunch unless taking pancakes home is a plus for some reason.</text>

<response>None</response><Text>Service was good, but the food (Philly cheese steak) was bland and the meat was tough. The peppers were undercooked, but the onions were fine. The fries were also lackluster, but we're remedied by the salt and pepper shakers on the table and a healthy severing of ketchup.< /Text>< Pics>

It's a very good place, our first interaction with an employee was okay but, our waitress was amazing she was nice, along with the person who was pouring coffee. Always there they seemed busy but never seemed to forget about the customers. Good job! Food was good recommend the Omelette.</review>

There is a waitress by the name of "Liz", she's quite attentive to your need's,  very pleasant, and an asset to Brandon's, that's why I continually come back...the food isn't that bad either. I like there menudo on the weekends.<//text>

Was given 45 min to 1 hr wait time for party of 7 (6 with a high chair). Multiple parties of 6 arrived while my party was waiting and were sat. Finally we were sat after complaining because we could have been sat at the booths the parties of 6 were sat cause the high chair would have gone on the end of the booth and still waited the hour. As we were being sat another party of 7 arrived and I knew they would be sat within 5 mins of putting their name on the waitlist. Sure enough they were accommodated by being sat at the table next to us that was “closed” due to covid and were served their food prior to us. Will not be returning.< /Text>

I wanted something quick so I went in and asked for their fastest food. I asked if they had anything pre-made and was told they had muffins. I ordered a blueberry muffin. I waited nearly 15 minutes for them to get it from across the room, only for it to noticeably stink, and taste incredibly bland. 1/5, wouldn’t trust them with real food.< /Text>

<review>Ronnie is incredible! Her customer service is fantastic, and she is on point when it comes to orders period this is the first time I ever come to Brandon's and she tells me exactly where everything is at in my order she offers me all the condiments not that the service isn't great the service is always good at Brandon's but during this time with covid it's nice to see people not only still having good attitudes about their jobs but gratitude for them and going the extra mile period she mentioned how she just started recently after some experiences at Amazon with kovid and how grateful she was for this job and I thought wow we need more people like her around the world so I definitely wanted to leave this feedback and let the owners know she needs to be promoted to a server once everything opens back up<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I ordered the country fried steak and eggs and a side of breakfast sausages. The fried steak would have been good if the gravy was cooked properly. All I could taste was raw flour. Aside from the sausages, it seems as though they were afraid if using salt. Almost everything was completely bland.

Saving grace was the breakfast sausages. Nice flavor and snap. It could use a bit more sage though.</Text>

Wow! I stopped in for a salad and ordered the weekday special,  an Avocado Salad. I was expecting something a little bigger than a side salad with a couple of slices of avocado on it. After all, it was only  $6.00. Boy was I surprised!  I was served an entree sized salad with what seemed like a whole avocado on it! I would have to try hard to get a bite without any avocado! I'm coming back again!  And again and again!<//text>

Brandon's Diner is an excellent place to get breakfast in Ontario before flying out. This place is located less than 10 minutes from Ontario International Airport & serves very delicious breakfast food. When I went here I ordered the Cinnamon Revolution French Toast breakfast which they actually at first screwed up my order and gave me the normal French toast but when I told them they instantly went and made me the correct order. They were very professional and very kind. I also would recommend there breakfast burritos as my friend ordered that and really loved how it tasted. If you like coffee than order a cup of coffee it's very delicious.</Review>

I had the chilaquiles here (sorry if its spelled wrong) a lot of places don't make it good but I really liked it here. We had great service. Its a little pricy for a regular diner but we enjoyed our food and portions are large.</Review>

Breakfast at Brandon's was all that we were hoping, and much more... the portions were huge. Brandon's had an extensive menu of American and Mexican food. The service was quick, and the food was very good. We ordered the Cinnamon Revolution French Toast, which was tasty, and made with large pieces of cinnamon bread. My favorite was the Chilequilas with a side order of crisp bacon. As a side note, the sodas and tea were served in really, large glasses. No need to wait for a server to fill us back up. I would be happy to return to Brandon's!<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Breakfast at Brandon's was all that we were hoping, and much more... the portions were huge. Brandon's had an extensive menu of American and Mexican food. The service was quick, and the food was very good. We ordered the Cinnamon Revolution French Toast, which was tasty, and made with large pieces of cinnamon bread. My favorite was the Chilequilas with a side order of crisp bacon. As a side note, the sodas and tea were served in really, large glasses. No need to wait for a server to fill us back up. I would be happy to return to Brandon's!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Breakfast buffet has great assortment but if you go before 10 be prepared to eat cold food. Don't even think about dinner. Taco Tuesday is fantastic but all other days food is tasteless. Brandon's Owners you've got to get involved. Check it out during the week and ask the few customers that are there. Check out Kick Back Jack's.<//text>

< Review>
Ordered a steak sandwich with fries. Almost half of my sandwich was fat and nerve. Spoke to the waitress and cashier when we paid and all they could say was oh each Brandon’s have different cooks. The waitress only said oh really! The husband had French toast and eggs and was good. But this location never again we go to the Moreno Valley and riverside one often never had bad service or bad food before! Waitress never came by to ask if we needed anything. I wish I took a picture but husband wouldn’t let me.  Just check your sandwich before eating! Steak was so tuff had to take the meat out and cut in little pieces. Of what was left.</Review>

<Review>I have been here with my husband (when we were dating), with my mom (twice). Yesterday, I brought my nephew who is visiting from out of town. Firstly, if you go on Sunday morning, come early. Although, yesterday we arrived about 945am and waited no more than 5 minutes.

There was a family that walked in just before we did, so I stood in back of them, but to the side, right in front of the cashier and hostess. When the cashier was done with what she was doing, she looked past me and asked the person behind me how many people were in their party. After they answered, she directed her attention to me and asked if I had been helped. Luckily, the girl next to her had already started scanning the restaurant for an empty table for us.

Our server was friendly and attentive. The food was okay. I had the Belgian waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. My nephew had the eggs Benedict. My potatoes could have used more seasoning, but otherwise than that, everything was fine. Brandon's also offers a breakfast buffet, but I've never tried it.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Also every time I visit I get the same waitress ( Vero) and she is the worst. I always get a salad with my dinner and she can never remember to bring it. I always have to remind her then I get my salad and then 2 minutes later I get my meal. So I finish my salad as my food gets cold. I had pork chops yesterday 02/06/2020 and it was the worst tasting pork chop I've ever had in my life. It's time to change the staff out especially Vero she's a real air head and slow as molasses.

< Review>
The service was severely lacking. When we walked in, there was no hostess. After a few minutes, a server walked up and asked where we wanted to sit. The place was pretty empty. She didn't tell us there was a buffet or any specials.  We asked for coffee and water but she only brought us one water with our coffees.  That's pretty much the way the rest of the meal went. The food was fair. We split a breakfast and she brought us a refrigerated plate for our hot food. She didn't check on us even to refill the coffee until we were almost done, at which point she was very nice. If the food had been really good, we'd try again. But it was just so - so.</Review>

<text>One of the best home style food in town. Food is excellent. Service is really good. Waitress always find ways to accommodate your needs. Buffet is very complete. I like the fact that restaurant would make the dishes just the way I want and they substitute items in the dish with no extra charge. The restaurant has a full bar as well. This place is really fun at happy hour. All the staff is really friendly and attentive.  Price wise? Food is very affordable and for those who need a good Menudo or Pozole on the weekend for the hangover, this is the place to go. This place is the best place to go to. I personally love the menudo here. This is one of the few places where the menudo and posole taste like home made.
Enjoy Brando's dinner......</text>< Date>

I had the open faced roast beef sandwich and it was very salty.   The gravy wasn't very good either.   Although it wasn't terrible,  if I ever come back, I definitely wouldn't order this again.  Portions are very generous.

My sister ordered the sausage and eggs.  She liked the biscuits and gravy...< /text>

My honey and I, love having Brandon's brunch. We wish they had it on Fridays.  I couldn't give it 5 stars because the delicious hard shell tacos aren't out until 11 am and you can't get one before 11 am for the life of you. The staff are always cheerful and offering their services. The food is always fresh and the Chile Verde is the best! I put it on my 3 eggs over easy and am in heaven!< /Text>

<pics>None</pics><rating>5<//rating><Response>None< /Response><Review>One of the best home style food in town. Food is excellent. Service is really good. Waitress always find ways to accommodate your needs. Buffet is very complete. I like the fact that restaurant would make the dishes just the way I want and they substitute items in the dish with no extra charge. The restaurant has a full bar as well. This place is really fun at happy hour. All the staff is really friendly and attentive.  Price wise? Food is very affordable and for those who need a good Menudo or Pozole on the weekend for the hangover, this is the place to go. This place is the best place to go to. I personally love the menudo here. This is one of the few places where the menudo and posole taste like home made.
Enjoy Brando's dinner......<//Review>< name>

I love Brandon's because it's has a diverse menu from American to Asian food. From the simple hamburger to the deep fried El Matador burrito that serves two or more. Serving sizes are ample and the servers are always nice and friendly.<//text>

<Review>Service is the worst. We walk in and were told to seat ourselves and eventually I had to go request menus.
10 minutes later we still haven't had our drink order taken. A few minutes later we finally have our order taken by a waiter who was very nice(John). He misheard one of our drink orders, which isn't the biggest issue but we requested the correct drink a different guy came and slammed it down the correct drink, turned and walked away without a word. The food ranged from okay to quite good so between John and that it gets a 2 but all of the other service was horrible, and personally my food tasted fine but was cold.<//Review>< Pics>

Looks like an older place, a bit pricey for the average but they do have daily specials and an all you can eat salad Bar.  There is a Bar (alcohol) separated on one side and they also have a banquet room available for rent if ever needed. Clean, very nice employees. Pretty decent and I will consider going back for sure.<//Text>

Great bloody mary, food was very good. They have a great selection of mexican food and American, but are a little on the expensive side. This was our first visit, I had the veggie omelet off the senior menu while my husband had the chicken fried steak, hope to try their dinner next time.<//Text>

<review>Mexican food buffet was awesome! All you can eat enchiladas, tacos, Chile rellenos, pancakes, French toast, albondigas and more. The chile Colorado was extremely  tender. I'll definitely be back.< /review>< time>

My husband & I went here for a quick bite to eat. They have an extensive menu that was very sticky as if it had old oil on it. We both chose the $10.95 lunch salad. With it we got a chicken breast or pc of tilapia. Plus there were small pcs of small servings of carrot cake, cheesecake, caramel pecan brownies, & a tray of great looking cookies.

We normally split a Coke cause I only drink a few sips. They brought what looked to me 2be a liter of Coke much too large for both of us. This tasted awful; I thought it was diet and sent it back. The 2nd 1 arrived and was equally bad. The syrup/soda water mix had 2b off or diet was in the regular Cole spot.

The salad bar itself was fair. Nothing special, but u could make a decent salad off of it. I love cantelope and pineapple chunks, they had both; pineapple was excellent! The cantelope looked great, had good texture, but tasted musty; I didn't eat my 3 pcs.

Next came our chicken for me and fish for my husband. He'll eat anything, I am the picky one. 1st I smelled his fish fr across the table. Then when I looked at my chicken, all I saw was a cooked pc of meat, with grease floating on top. Both appeared to have been grilled, but both had this layer of grease on them. I put a napkin on the chicken to blot up this liquid. I wound up covering it up & passing to my husband, cause it looked so bad, the smell of both was nauseating me. He only picked at his fish. I dont think he had 1 bite. He decided we'd take boith home to our 2 doxies.

We split the 3 desserts. They were all only slivers, perfect size for a salad bar. I liked the cheesecake. He loved the carrot cake, his fav cake. The brownie looked great, but that's all. It tasted as if it were missing something. Oh and the beautiful spread of cookies...not so  good either.

We pd & left, carrying our box of chicken & fish for our dogs. We drove to a shop in the same strip mall, went in a few minutes. When we returned & he opened my car door, I told him he had to put the chicken & fish in the trunk. The aroma was so over-powering, that my stomach turned, again. Instead, he picked the box up and threw it in a nearby trashcan, adding that he was bothered by the smell & it not being fit to feed our dogs.

I gave it 2 stars for the carrot cake & cheesecake slivers. They were just the right size for a taste. Plus they were good. Given the lacking brownie, I'd guess they weren't made in house.</text>

1st time there. Had a great experience. Went with the familia. Had breakfast there, menudo, VERY good & 8 other family members had different plates & all stated enjoying their food.  The only bad thing were they seated us the side room the air condition didn't work well, so it was HOT & STUFFY. Bathroom (women) was clean as was the restaurant. Our waitress was great!!!.< /Text>

<review>Aside from the service and cleanliness I can only speak on the breakfast part for this restaurant. I had the chicken and waffles which comes with 2 eggs cooked to order. It was actually pretty good for a restaurant that does not serve soul comfort food. The chicken was not overwhelmingly salty, but it was just a little dried for my taste as if it was overcooked  just a little. Might have been just that day. Other than that service was excellent, very courteous and professional. Place is very clean and spacious. I will be coming back.

Food was very good, but kinda pricey for a diner. Service was good, although I asked for a refill on my drink and the waitress said she would bring me one I never got it. We were seated in the lounge area wich was kinda cozy compared to the regular dining area. They were busy but we still received our food fairly quickly and it was still hot. Parking was scarce and we did have to drive up and wayyy down the aisles before finding a spot. Overall it was a nice place with good food and we enjoyed our visit! Would return to this establishment for another meal or maybe even for happy hour!<//text>

They asked how was the food & we were honest and said the meat was toooo salty then she only returned to give us our receipt and never came back. We got 10% off for salty food then when we paid she left us at the register signing for our credit card transaction. This is what we get for being "HONEST". Don't recommend this place.< /Review>

I'll give 2 stars 1.for not being disgusting, 2. For being a place that had food when I was hungry. Overpriced, sub par food and service, and it got pretty warm in there also.< /text>

Poor service. My fiancé ordered a dinner salad that should have came to the table before her food but it never made it. I ordered a southwestern grilled chicken salad and the chicken had no grilled marks, was cold and soggy. Awful!!!< /Text>

The have a guy that sells Jerseys out of their dinner. Chris, sits and hangs out at the bar and he scams you. Takes your money for an order and never gave us the Jersey we ordered and or gave us the money back. Cant trust an establishment that associates and allows people to do business out of their dinner like that.< /review>

I was very disappointed because the syrup is in a glass container it was so hot it burnt the tips of my fingers and I got little blisters my meal was free but I was very disappointed because that's not very safe especially for children we did talk to the manager and he had that the water turned down from the containers but it's not very safe for them to be in that hot water it was very super hot I have little blisters that popped up on my fingers after we left< /text>

Thev service was terrible and our food was cold.  Our waiter/ bartender was angry because they were understaffed and slammed our meals down on the table.  The food was mediocre at best.< /Review>
