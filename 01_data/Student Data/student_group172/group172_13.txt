<review>I got dip powder acrylic and I had Tammy as a technician. She was very sweet and did such a great job! I'm just here for vacation but if I lived here, this would be my regular place to go. She took really good care to detail and even went the extra mile to clean my cuticles and make sure I left loving my nails.<//review>< Name>

From temp check to hand washing, I felt at ease. I got my nails done by the one and only, Diana. She gave me ice gel perfection, letting me get two different colors on each hand. She shaped my nails perfectly as well. Highly recommend the entire salon and Diana especially. If I could give more stars, I totally would.< /Review>< Pics>

They work diligently and take in consideration your time. Very relaxing and the pedicure massage is phenomenal. I will definitely be back to get a pedicure and try out a manicure soon as well!

I went to get mani pedi and the pedicure was good but my manicure was a nightmare. I don't do my nails very often so the ladies killed my cuticles and cut me many times, today my cuticles are red and swollen, she was not careful at all. I'm not going back.< /Review>

They have a lot of colors as well. Everyone here is so nice and all the nail techs do a great job and are perfectionist. They made sure you love your nails here. Also it was very clean and sanitary. They really followed all the COVID protocols and I felt safe here!! I will also be going back here from now on for all my nail wants!! Lastly, they have affordable prices!

Hands down- the best place to come for nails. I’ve been coming here for some time how and I can honestly say that I’ve never been dissatisfied with the service. It’s is clean and they are taking extra measures to make everyone feel safe during these times.

Oh and if you want a bomb gel mani, hit up my girl Diana. She’s the queen of designs. But really, everyone here gets down! Susan did my pedi today and her paint job is perfection.</Text>

Tiffany did my nails. And she did an excellent job. I got a dip powder manicure and it looks great! The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the place needs some major cleaning/upgrading. For the quality of work they do, the place on the inside just doesn’t match.< /text>

Great service!! They were so nice and helpful. I got a really simple negative space design and my technician was very careful to make sure we had the same idea in mind and it looked perfect. I even picked a lighter color at first that didn't pop and she tried one nail, asked my thoughts and then let me pick a better one. I wish I'd gotten her name. She was younger and really pretty - it seemed like she might be one of the main girls to do designs there though. So I'm sure if you mention you want one, they'll get you with the right tech. 10/10 would recommend< /review>

I found my new Nail Salon. I have just returned from my third pedicure visit and am very pleased. Yes, they have Rolly-Ball/Massage Chairs. The services are well priced, for $30 (not including tip) I had the Deluxe which included calluse removal, 15 minute massage, salt treatment, hot lotion and polish! Heaven! My pedicure is pamper time yet like many of us ladies our days are full with work, family obligations and a never ending To-Do List. I had my Spa experience, left relaxed, happy and within an hour allowing me to 'tick' pedicure off my list with fabulous feet and dance off to accomplish the next task on my To-Do List.< /Review>

I wouldn't go anywhere else but here.  The ladies are so nice here and they pay attention to detail.  I get my gel mani here all the time and my pedi.  I also get my eyebrow waxed here too.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Hello all,
All the reviews you see in 5 stars rating are fake all that 5 stars rating from their employee, bunch girls working there are liar, I believed they don't want to liar but owner Corinne force them to liars, they liars everything they can and most their liars not making any sense. Their products made from Plaster and cheap resin and no warranty, all the foam using mot of them from carpet underpayment material. don't be pool to buy product by the look come to their warehouse and you can see there are 2 guys repairing all day long. We are retailer to selling their products all merchandise damaged  and they used wood bondo and wood filter  to cover their damaged and resell them as new one again, as soon as we pick up merchandise we have to sign to release liability and that is it (you on your own). There is many company made much better stuff than Homey Design. Look at the pictures Homey design products made from Styrofoam for dining table leg and chairs< /Review>< Pictures>

Horrible service and unacceptable furniture quality. My coworkers and I went to pick up furniture from their warehouse and almost every piece came chipped and damaged. The structure of their furniture is beautiful but the quality is very bad. Stay away from this company if you don’t want your furniture coming in damaged.< /review>

<Date>1563344980692</Date><Text>I’ve been purchasing from Homey Designs for over 10 years. Never have I had any of the issues that others claim to have in their negative reviews. I am a business owner and retail home furnishings. Things rarely arrive perfect from any supplier and when you’ve been in the business as long as I have, you’ve seen it all. I find Homey Design’s quality, designs & their staff to be wonderful and i’ve experienced  their reps who go above and beyond to help my brick and mortar business work despite the internet companies out there, our governments tariff fight overseas and increasing freight costs left and right.

Don’t believe the haters or wannabe drop shippers who don’t really understand how business is. Homey Design is a great company to work with if you want unique styles at a great value for your clients.

P.S. I received no compensation for this review and I’m not a fake person either ...  Just believe the good people at Homey Design deserve to hear from people who do believe they are doing wholesale right.</Text><user_name>Keith in California</user_name><UserId.>108455896791506474854</UserId.>< response>

<Text>Please don't waste your time and money on this money design. The pictures in catalog is so beautiful but their stiffs are not the same very poor quality and expensive. I bought a bed and would never buy any thing again. I felt cheated.

<review>the furniture look beautiful but the quality  is very poor. i bought the HD-551 set 4 months ago and I dust the furniture with a dry micro cloth and the furniture is cracking and chipping . the wood and fabric of the set is also very poor in quality. it's not cheap in price but I would never but another piece of furniture from this brand or recommend to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

I purchased a beautiful bedroom set that exceeded my expectations, I am extremely happy with the product. The wood and the fabric is rich in color and stands out in my home. I look forward to working with this company to furnish my entire home. The customer service department was very helpful.<//text>

< Review>
I regret buying their furniture. Very bad workmanship. Got their furniture delivered 3 weeks ago. Headboard has nails pop all over it. Dresser drawers are all messed up. You'have to pull them out real hard then good luck getring them to close. I called the store where i bought the furniture from " Elegant Furniture " in Houston, TX. That guy never returned my call. Ive called the store about 7 - 8 times. Anyway long story short this company's furniture is very ghetto. Don't be fooled with the catalogue look.< /Review>

KEEP AWAY!! This company is fake. I wired over $18500 for furniture, they sent damaged goods and refused to change it, do not be fooled by the pictures. They will not give you any other options to pay because people already disputed the cc charges. you will regret it, ema and mia and Ashley are crooks. Im am not one to badmouth people but i lost so much money because of this companys ignorance and low standards. Keep away please.< /Review>

<name>furniture max<//name><time>1538758599077<//time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>DO NOT BUY!!! It will be a purchase you will regret. We run a family owned furniture business out of Memphis, TN & we spent over $13,000 with this company and have not received all the pieces we ordered. We reported this to the company and they have been giving us the run-around and have been dodging our calls, emails, faxes, etc, something I have never experienced with any of the other vendors we've dealt w/over the years. This was our 1st time however ordering from Homey Design , but DEFINITELY the last. This nightmare has been going on for about a month now. We were trying to service a very special customer of ours who was looking for mansion quality furniture which is how Homey Design advertised their product. Fast forward to today and we are now being sued by our customer because for about a month she has had a bed w/no footboard and it's not the type of bed that could function without a footboard, missing dresser for the mirror and shoddy quality on the dining room chairs for the order<//text>< Pics>

New gazebos and full track lining the outskirts of the park. Beautiful and serene. The only downfall is sometimes in the evening teenagers will gather under a gazebo and smoke marijuana, quite annoying.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>It's relatively simple with two kids play area. They created an exercise area. You see adults walk around and exercise. It has parking. Wheel chair parking. There was a staff personnel keeping the area clean and letting us know the parents or visitors know the restroom 🚻 would be closing. Didn't need to with my little ones but I'm certain it must of been well stock and clean.</review>< Pictures>

What can one say about this or any other Golden Corral, except Go there Hungry. A true all american buffet, all you can eat foods from salads, chicken, ribs, meatloaf, steak and of course dessert(s) and much much more! While the food is far from top shelf, it is more than adequate , but again, it is a self serve buffet.This location seems to shine a little better, both in food presentation, selection as well as service, than other Golden Corrals I/We have been to. We found this Golden Corral to be clean and the food good. A great value for the money. Overall Rating~ Very Good!<//Text>

The place was closed I came all the way from the valley just because my friend lives close by when I got there everything was closed and I just wanted a resting spot but no sign no nothing. At least post online that it's closed . It's annoying because I have physical problems.< /Review>

A neat little park with a few benches on the South side that are great for having lunch and catching ​up with some good friends. There's a good crowd that regularly plays handball, and basket ball courts for some fun pickup.<//review>

I had horrible experience getting a birthday cake from this place. I showed her pic and said we could make this cake the way i wanted. The cake was simple cake and just i wanted airplane that they make with fondant on cake but they didn't make the airplane same as the pic that i gave them. I don’t  know why when they cant make cake same that pic we want, they take the order.< /review>

We went to 3 other bakeries in the Burbank and Glendale and Masis Bakery was the best, understanding and reasonable bakery in town. The cake was a big hit at the wedding and everyone loved the look of the cake and the taste.  They are now my go to bakery when I am in town.  Thank you< /text>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>We had horrible experience getting a birthday cake from this place. We showed them two pictures and they said they could make the cake the way we wanted, we asked blue background which could have been sprayed on making it marble looking and crystal sugar added to have crystal rock affect. When the time came to pick up the cake, it was only white cake and gold trims. They got the crystal part right though. We let them know it's not looking like the one in our picture. They said well the baker is gone already. While gone in the back room though knowing how bad this looks they used some of the gold paint again on the white parts, but you can see it was just done by rubbing their fingers around the cake. You will see it in my pictures. We had no choice to take the cake since we had a birthday to do and everywhere was closed already for Christmas. Later on I call to ask why they messed up my order so badly, without apologizing they said we told you we can't make it that way but we wanted to do something for you and this is the way, we can't do anything else. I asked for supervisor or manager, they denied saying he or she is not here. I asked them to ask supervisor to call me. After waiting for a day no one called I called again. They finally agreed to give discount with out stating how or how much, on our next order. I was fine with that since we needed another cake for the new year. When we go to choose a cake again no supervisor comes to talk to us even after few times asking for them. they make no apologies and yet they argued that you won't be getting what you think you can get, meaning that you can't get your money back or get another cake for reduced price. After few minutes though they said go choose cake and we will take 10$ off. Ten dollars for the embarrassing situation they created for us and getting our birthday girl to cry on her special day? Not to mention going back and forth on the phone with them. Here are the pictures you be the judge.</Text></record>

I ordered the cake Flamingo, and asked specifically don't do the mistake that they did with the cake pictured on their Instagram. My request was completely ignored, the cake very poorly made and looks ridiculous. They told me that they will fix it, but returned it after 2 min the same way as it was. Very disappointed by the service. Would never order again!< /review>

<Text>I can't tell you how much I appreciate what Masis Bakery did for me!!! I got married this past Saturday and the amazing team over at Masis Bakery fulfilled a rush order for almost 400 Macaroon without hesitation!!! They didn't just sell me 400 pieces... they went above and beyond and wrapped them individually for a very fair price. The best part is, they did all of this in 2 days!!! Who else can prepare 400 individually wrapped Macaroons for a wedding in 2 days for a very fair price?! Nobody!

This amazing bakery has earned my business for life! Thank you!!!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

A great mom and pop place with a lot of high quality desserts and cakes at an affordable price. I supplied my son's 1st birthday from here and it was a huge hit! We got a fondant red velvet cake made with jungle themed and it came out perfect, the cake was the talk of the party and so was the platter of desserts! I just got 2 trays of the little bite sized desserts (was very affordable) and everyone loved it. A huge hit and will be coming back for every occasion I host now. I highly recommend coming here for quality, expensive-looking cakes and desserts with huge flavor but WITHOUT breaking the bank.

Our guests thought we spent a fortune but we didn't! I had quotes of $350+ for a 2-tiered fondant cake and we got ours for less than $90! The little cake slices were $1 each vs somewhere else which would be $3.

Highly, highly recommend. We moved out of town now but I will travel for the great price and flavor.<//Text>

<name>lea jana</name><date>1527180283029</date><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Was super excited when I entered this bakery. First time here.......very beautiful, creative designs. The customer service was horrendous, however. It wasn't busy and yet when I asked about the flavors and prices of cakes, the young lady helping was short and inattentive. I asked her to describe the meringue flavor they have since they were the most beautiful of the cakes. She pointed to a cookie with brown in it and that was it. I asked another lady to describe the flavor, she spoke to the first women in a different language and the first women walked over to me and told me my order was ready so I never got my answer. Mind you, I am the kind of customer that will buy anything that sounds good, regardless of price. I then see a beautiful flower floating in a green-like substance and ask the woman to describe it. She said "jello". I asked her if the flower was made out of jello and she shrugged her shoulders and dismissed the question. She seemed rather mad at this point that I was asking these questions, but I have never seen such beautiful and creative bakery items and simply wanted to know more about what I was interested in. Heck, I would have bought half the store if these people were in any remote way interested in investing 5 minutes of their time helping me choose goodies. I then asked to see my cake in the box 2 times, as I asked the lady to inscribe Happy Birthday with my daughters name on it. She told me the total and I asked again to see the cake. She didn't put my daughters name on it! Now she seemed really perturbed at me. It's a shame that they will be losing such a good customer when all they needed to do was interact with a good paying patron who's interested in their creations!!<//Review>< Pics>

I went by the bakery today, I purchased several cakes to sample in order to place a a cake for 150 people. I patiently waited for the lady behind the counter to serve other customers. When it was my turn the lady tells me if I can come back another day or order over the phone because she is busy, there was only one person behind me.

I felt the people at rude and have little to none etiquette . I walked and they lost my business for good. Horrible customer service!<//Review>

Dropped in on Christmas day and wasn't sure what to expect. The selection was excellent and everything purchased here was quite good. Grabbed a cherry pie, some custard stuffed pastries and an opera bar. It was crowded but that may have been because everything else was closed that day.< /review>

It was a good meal, no complaints whatsoever. The thing that was AMAZING was their choice of cake slices. For as little as $1.70-$2.30 you can enjoy some delicious cakes. We got 4 different ones, to share throughout the week. We had all four the same day, because all of them were so good that we couldn't wait. This bakery is one of my highest recommendations.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Opening the door to this bakery, it appeared as though I was walking into a dessert wonderland.  The cashier was very friendly and was happy to explain different items.  This time, I tried the vanilla and red velvet cupcakes.  They were $1.75 each, but they were muffin sized and had a good deal of icing on the top.  The red velvent had a smooth cream cheese icing and the vanilla had a soft, lightly-sweetened vanilla icing.  I also purchased two small french macaroons, they were also just sweet-enough.  I would return to try other pasteries!<//Review>

It's 9:00pm and the owner is leaving. Bakery time isn't correct. Therefore don't recommend location.<//Review>

I just got out of this bar... my best friend and i went with our girl friends there after an amazing comedy show, spend over 200 dollar had a ok evening.. at 1:55 am we got kicked out with a PUNCH of the bar tender,WHILE WE WERE FINISHING OUR DEINK AND GOING TO THE BATHROOM. We stop the fight because we are peaceful people. A nice evening became an awful night. Would never recommend this bar and bar tenders are awfully rude!!<//Review>

Nice quiet place with good amount of seating and a full bar. Two occasions I've been here it's been pretty mellow and a small getaway from other areas in the city with huge crowds and loud settings. Very close to Bart and generally Meter parking around as well as some hourly free parking as well. Bathrooms friendly too.< /text>

Super chill spot around the corner from Bart, some cheap food places nearby. Drinks are standard, not too overpriced. Really easy meet up place for anyone before heading out to other places. Plus pretty sure they have candy which is always a plus.<//text>

<Text>Always a HIT!! Friendly enough bar keep and patrons, plus they're the only ones open on a Wednesday at midnight in the area. After a night of dance class and rehearsal at Dance Mission pretty sure you deserve a break ... so go get it.  Cheers 🍻!!<//Text>< Pics>

Great place in the Mission to hang. Not crowded. Not empty. Nicely decorated. Good atmosphere & lighting. Clean. Cocktail pitcher deals! Good rap & hip-hop on the speakers. These are all things I'm looking for in a solid bar. I went on a Thursday night, after dinner. Hope to return soon.</review>

We just moved into the neighborhood and tried this place. Spent 30 dollars for a horrible lunch. I ordered taco platter and the entire plate was drenched with grease. My tacos were soggy and fell apart. My boyfriend had soup and salad. The soup was served to him barely luke warm. His sandwich was hard as a rock. The bread was old and he couldn't even bite into it. The roast beef was tuff and chewy. It took us forever to get our food. We paid our bill and left very disappointed.< /Text>

Makes one of the best cosmos in the city. Make sure to ask for a joke before you tip him and then tip accordingly. He thought it was hilarious.</Review>< UserId.>

It worked out perfectly! We were also allowed to bring in our own food which was awesome.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Super chill low key bar, good for chatting. Decent cocktails and cool hip hop music in the background!</Review>

Stopped here while on a visit to SF.  Was really intrigued when I walked in and saw all the Jarritos (Mexican soft drinks) on the wall. Do they use them in there drinks!? The answer, of course, is yes! Had a margarita and a dark and stormy both made with different flavors, and they were both delicious. You can also get drinks with your normal ingredients, but why would you!? I'm really glad I stopped here, and will definitely stop by again if I'm ever in the neighborhood. You should too!</Text>

<text>To Andoni -  I was there that night and helped the bar tender get you and your friends out of the bar after several requests and calls for last call. You guys were rude and disrespectful and The staff was polite in trying get you out of there. No punches were thrown.

I left with my friends and you continued to try to fight us. We're adults, we dont fight but you continued to try to get in our faces.

As you said....it was 1:55. Time to leave.

This place is solid if you are respectful to everyone.<//text><user_id>108429832380605354673<//user_id>< pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Came here because my friends consider this their local watering hole. The bartender is so so so rude. My friends and I were sitting at the table by the door. The door was open and table beside us  was cold, so they closed the door. The bartender came by and closed the door, specifically telling my table "it's so hot back at the bar". Okay, my table doesn't care if the door is open, we understand that the staff wants it closed although we are also feeling cold. A few minutes later, the people at the table beside us (the ppl who originally closed the door) get up and close the door again. This time the bartender / manager comes by and full-on yells at my table, accusing us of shutting the door and screaming that "the door stays open". We tried to say we didn't close the door and we understand, but he just kept screaming at our table saying "I DON'T CARE, THE DOOR STAYS OPEN!!"

Wow, I have never had such unbelievably service. The service staff here are so rude. They scream and yell at customers for no reason. I had no reason to dislike this bar before the wait staff screamed at us. But after that incident, I would never recommend this bar to anyone nor would I ever come back.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808f7e40bafb1c81:0xcabe3dff1f1e1ea3</Gmap_id></record>

Always a good selection of fun cocktails, and the bartender is always attentive and polite. A bit dark inside but not so much that it detracts from the experience. They take credit cards but have a $20 minimum.</Text>

Red Label is amazing i have been coming here since Alex opened the shop.the service is always excellent and everyone is friendly. Alex and his crew constantly give back to people whether through donations in the community or just really helping somebody in need. Red Label is being targeted by the Ignorant due to opposing political views. Obviously these people have never been to Red Label nor do they know Alex and the crew. I recommend this shop to my co-workers all the time and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be treated as family and not just a number.</text>

<Text>I had Red Label install a Diamond Eye 3" downpipe and 4" exhaust on my 1997 7.3 a couple weeks ago. I was told by Cody when making my appointment that they do this exhaust all the time and they are very careful in not damaging the firewall. I dropped truck off at 10am and 6 hrs later called for an update. Cody said they were running into problems getting the exhaust to fit and said it would be done the next day since he wanted the techs to take thier time and do it right.
Picked up truck next day, popped the hood at the shop before leaving and saw a 6" diameter section of my firewall right behind the downpipe chewed up with sawzall cuts exposing the insulation. My engine and valley was also covered in metal shavings from where they cut the factory downpipe by the turbo and once home, found the exhaust hanger that holds the intermediate pipe and takes the weight of pipe off the turbo flange was never installed.Would have only taken a minute to vacuum and clean up your work and install a hangar.
I went back in and told Cody and he brought the tech out to look at it and was told by Cody, "The flange from the downpipe must have caused the damage during install because the firewall material is very brittle being 20 years old and SOMETIMES THATS JUST THE PRICE OF MODS." After that response I lost all faith in this shop and just wanted to leave. If a mod is going to cause damage to a customers vehicle, especially to a part that isnt made anymore,  it sure would be nice to be notified before hand. The material is not brittle and truck is in near mint condition. Its hard finding and keeping these older trucks looking like new. Ive only done 2 downpipes before and they are indeed a real pain but nothing gets damaged if you take your time. Unfortunatley I didnt have the time to do mine myself. Cody did offer to try to source a used firewall since they are not made anymore but I just retired from the military and was moving across country at the end of the week so I didnt have the time to wait.
I really wanted to like this shop and this was a second chance from some sub par work done last year. They do have a lot of good reviews so maybe I was just one of the unlucky ones. Just a bummer that now every time I open my hood I see the $250 I spent for Red Label Diesel to hack my firewall.< /Text><time>1590553338599<//time><Rating>2</Rating>< pictures>

<Text>Great people, cool projects, problem solvers that do good work! I was driving from LA to Calgary (1800 mi) in a Porsche powered with an LS3 V8. Having any kind of car problem with this car is worrisome because generally the GM guys don't know Porsche, the Porsche guys don't know GM and the car is a Frankenstein. My alternator belt started squealing, I found this shop on Google maps. They got me in right away, found the issue and fixed the broken alternator bolt. They really appreciated the car's uniqueness. It wasn't a complex problem, but if I had something harder I am confident these people and this shop could solve it.</Text>< resp>

I came in for an oil change one day, the tech apparently broke my oil plug and they charged me 40 bux for a bolt, they also said my truck takes 4 gal of oil when it only takes 3 gal.. I let them do their thing without saying anything; this technique allows people to show their true character and I wasnt impressed with theirs.<//review>< pictures>

<text>We were so blessed to have found this shop on our family road trip! After having numerous car troubles we decided we had to stop and found this place online. The staff was friendly, helpful and seemed to genuinely care about our car and getting us back on the road. They worked quickly and were done before the quoted time. They recommended to us some other work but were not in the least bit pushy and told us to research and find a place near home to get it done...that was the final proof we needed that this place cared about cars and customers and not just about making money. They replaced our water pump and our window regulator and even welded our radiator intake pipe and we couldn't have been more pleased with the experience. Thank you red label!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<review>Five stars all around and would give more stars if I could! Very kind people and A+ customer service! I didn't have an appointment, but dropped my car around lunchtime today based on a recommendation from Jiffy Lube personnel. My car had been overheating and I needed to get to work early tomorrow morning. Not only were the tech able to get to my car, they got it back to be by closing time. On top of that, it turned out to be a minor problem and they didn't charge me. Red Label, I truly appreciate the wonderful service!! I am bringing my car there from now on! If you have any service needs I highly recommend this place!!!<//review>< Pics>

I had my truck's transmission serviced here and was very satisfied. The techs were knowledgeable and timely in their service. I would recommend Red Label Auto to anyone!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Everyone at this shop was amazing. Had my car towed there due to overheating, and though it was past closing time for them, they stayed open to accommodate me dropping off the keys. They looked at my car the very next day (even though they were busy) and gave me an honest assessment, saving me a lot of money and future headache. The car was dead in the water and repairing it would've cost more than it was worth, so I ended up selling it to a junkyard. The guys held it in their back lot till the junkyard could come collect it, because I had no means of getting it anywhere or storing it. Bottom line, they took care of me, a girl with no transportation and who knew nothing about cars. Very caring, knowledgeable, honest and respectful -- a hard combination to find in mechanics! I would recommend them any day.< /Review>< pics>

I have a 97 diesel f350, I would not let anybody else touch that truck except for this shop.....
My son in law has a 2006 Ford Excursion  6.0. He had numerous shops work on his 6.0 and every time he got it back there were issues (big issues).

I suggested Red Label to him. They put in a new motor and did some (upgrades) bullet proofing and he has had no problems with it since.
They have a guy down there that specializes in the 6.0..

Great shop, I live in Sac and Ill drive the 50 minutes to their shop. Well worth the drive.

I guess this is a good time to show off my truck,,, she might be old but she is a pretty one,,  drove her to Eri Pa, down to Florida, up through the Carolinas,,  towed a 11000 pound Rv part of the way. She never missed a beat.

Lots of mechanics around,,, but there are not many "good" ones...

Red Label has been good to me...................

11/01/2018

My son in law had a electrical issue in his 6.0 which are very hard to diagnose, RL stated he needed a new wiring harness $2000,, another shop disagreed and stated it needed a injector control module for $300. Turns out it was the injector control module.

So if you have a major repair, might be good to get a second opinion and that goes with anything your repairing.

I still give RL five stars,, and the guy who told my son in law his problems was with the wiring harness,, 2 stars...

Get  second opinion on any major repair , to your truck, house, whatever it might be,,, no one is perfect and it could save you a lot of money in the end.< /Text>

<Text>We are travelling from Canada with friends and my husbands dodge 3500 was overheating. We brought it to dodge in vacaville and we're told 1400 for a water pump and quoted 5 hours to fix it and that they wouldn't have the part until the next day. We called Red Label and they told us they had the part, could install within an hour, and quoted us 400. Plus they understood that we were in a hurry and were so accommodating. Long story short we told dodge that we were going to have the work done elsewhere and conveniently they popped our tire pulling the truck out of their shop. They wound up having our truck for almost 12 hours after their screw up and Red Label still managed to make time for us asap the next morning. They had our truck in and out with extra work my husband wanted done in 3 hours.....the time it took dodge to change a tire.
Thank you SO MUCH to the guys at Red Label for being so accommodating, fast and kind (and for not ripping us off!!) The guys at Dodge could take some serious notes from you!!</Text>< Pictures>

Have been going here for past 2 years. Wouldn't trust my vehicles to anyone else. They are putting a new engine in an old vehicle of ours right now. The engine being blown was no fault of theirs as they had not even seen it until we had it towed in. Would recommend them to anyone.<//text>

<Text>This bar is great, especially when you narrow down your options in the area.
There's a pool table and dart boards.
The staff is absolutely awesome. Everyone is so friendly...Damien is my favorite bartender.

I've come here after work a couple times for happy hour.
They have a great selection of beers on tap, and they make strong drinks.
They also serve burgers, french fries, mozzarella sticks, spinach dip etc.

Very casual spot, located right next door to the Ramada :)</Text>< date>

Great spot for a few inexpensive drinks. Entrance is through the back until a certain time. Limited parking out back, there's usually parking around the area. Big, well ventilated dance area and some pool tables complete the experience. Good amount of tables too.< /text>

Hands down the best beer selection this side of the valley. Plus the karaoke is fun too. There's only one pool table, but people are pretty good about sharing it.< /review>

I don't know what happened to this place. Once the remodel occured it seemed to lose its luster.

The prices went up, the atmosphere died.

That said, you won't find a bigger beer selection in the West Valley than this place. Usually rare one offs from the SoCal craft breweries can be found here. The whiskey selection is gigantic.<//review>

They recently expanded this place and it looks great. They have multiple pool tables, dart boards and a killer craft beer selection. The food is okay, a little over priced.<//text>

I love hang out there, they have a hudge beer seleccion, a little food bar menu as well. The ambiance is always relax and fun. The place and atmosphere make it easy to meet new friends. Karaoke nights are so much fun there too! Darts and pool table. The place is also very big and looks very casual and nice.</Review>

A good spot to bring parties or board games because of the large tables & space. However there are small booths and tucked away corners if you are on a date.  It looks like they do Kareoke on Wednesdays. Have a happy hour, pool tables and dance floor. The selection of food is quaint but tastey, with varying brews, and taps that change daily. I almost didn't review this place to keep it low key, rumor is that it's poppin' on the weekends, maybe because there's an inn right next door...<//Text>

two days ago was the first time we came to that fine restaurant. But It is obviously not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the courteous service, with the first-rate  food and fine drinks and with the honest price. We will definitely return there in a short time.</Review>

Locals kinda place. I stuck out like a sore thumb. You can tell it's been around for a long time by the decor but it's a lively crowd. Strong drinks? They got em. It's a tight room so bring a smile and be prepared for a little jostling.</Review>

<Review>How do I describe this place? You see this place from the outside and your like umm, is this the right place? Then you walk inside and it's hands down the greatest bar on the West coast. The bartender, Ron White (not the comedian), is the BEST bartender you'll ever meet. If you're ever near the world's shittest casino (San Pablo lytton) go to this hidden treasure that is Jerry's. If Ron's there you'll have the BEST night of your life. I've officially capitalized the word BEST three times and I'm UNDER selling this place.

Jerrys may be a little whole in The wall but you wont get drinks From any where else that cheap and that amount. lol Jerrys dont sale you a "Shot" o f alcohol they give you a "Cup!!! of alcohol. The Crowd is mostIy Older folks but they know how to have a good time. It's more blacks in the evenings and whites early on in the day, but it's 2012 who sees color?  Jerrys is home away from home< /Review>

Real nice baseball field. Clean bathrooms. With a snack shack. Shade over the back stop bleachers. Tree shade other places around the diamond. Sticky red dirt. Oh well that's baseball. It washed out.<//review>

<review>Very beautiful trail along the Bay lands area.  It borders the back off the golf course. You can see planes taking off from the Palo Alto airport.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I really like the trails and salt marshes here. The bathrooms are cleaned regularly and I appreciate that a lot. The only downside is all the construction going on. But I know it's to better the area. Sometimes there are stray dogs around. And there is parking here but with the construction going on, there's less spaces and lots of active trucks going back and forth. The field itself is peaceful, aside from construction. But I usually walk the trails.< /text>

<Text>I am only giving this 4-stars because of the constant construction or destruction.  I would imagine this to get 'better' once everything is complete with the construction.  Parking is hit or miss and on busy days can be a bit trying. There also seems to be heavy machinery traffic (e.g. bulldozers type of equipment) when I was there...< /Text>< Pictures>

Authentique, delicious, Latin bakery! I ordered a Très Lèches sheet for 35 people for a co-workers birthday, and it was AMAZING!  Not too sweet, a hint of cinnamon, probably one of the best Très Lèches I've ever tasted. Wonderful customer service and locally/independently owned, this place is a must if you're looking for authentic Latin cakes and pastries!< /Text>

I'm so happy with my cake! For some reasons some other shops wouldn't make my cake because of the complicated print I guess but Lelenitas did and now I have an awesome Jojo's Bizzare Adventure cake! 💜💜💜< /review>

Their guava cakes 👌🏼, chicken or guava or pineapple empanadas 🤤, espumillas (egg white dessert swirls) 💗, rum desserts and jello desserts 😋 are always on par and satisfying. They even have all natural cocoa on occasion all prepped, which i use for my own home desserts. They have always been my to go place for parties, and everyone always wants to know where the cake is from. Lelenitas is the only bakery for me!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) If you don't love it, they won't let you write, and that's why I put the 5 stars, but I have 1 hour of calling and only the machine comes out, they should have better service when answering calls. . It's business I think.

(Original)
Si no pones me encantó no te dejan escribir, y por eso puse las 5 estrellas, pero tengo 1 hora de estar llamando y solo la maquina sale, deberían de tener mejor servicio al contestar las llamadas. . Es negocio creo.< /Review>

This Whole Foods has a really dope cheese and wine section and beers and stouts. I just bought some really delicious blueberry cheese and lavender cheese and oh my gawd, pair with a Riesling or Chardonnay and it’s perfect. This location is perfect because it’s also an Amazon return location so you can stand in line and return purchases with issues etc. The cashier that helped me was so nice and friendly and you can tell she wasn’t trying to be fake and it wasn’t forced-that’s always nice. This was the first time I was at a Whole Foods and they had a front table near the checkout lines that had a special or monthly wine and cheese for the month. I ended up grabbing a Riesling because of this. The variety of things and multiple options here makes this Whole Foods a great location.< /text>

I like what Whole Foods has to offer and they have some specialty items I enjoy.  That's wonderful.  But prices are high and I had a bit of a surprise today.  I finally got the app working to get my Amazon Prime discount only to find out the discount is only for what's already on sale...   Really?  I thought it was a discount on whatever one purchased but, no, only on sale items.  Doesn't make sense to me but I'll continue to shop there for things I can't get anywhere else (and hope they're on sale).</Text>

<Review>This Whole Foods is a good size, has a big selection of local and in-season products. Their meat, cheese, seafood and deli counters have large and fresh selections of products. Their bar that's attached is awesome.
Minus one star because since COVID began, this location has a lot of Amazon Prime shoppers in the store all the time, and it gets difficult to shop around them. No fault of their own, it just gets crowded.</Review><gmap_id>0x808fc9f208a428e9:0xc3f7aa7b9e59dcc9< /gmap_id>< Response>

<text>Worst grocery pickup experience of the entire pandemic. Filed my complaints on Amazon, but the store management for this location needs to get two-sided signage for the Grocery Pickup area, and add more signage, especially over by the "Pickup Only" area, to make it clear that "Pickup Only" it is NOT the Grocery Pickup area... When you enter via Coronado Pl, all you see is "Pickup Only" signage in the parking area, while the "Grocery Pickup" signage on the curb by the store is facing the opposite direction, rendering it invisible. Was late for work due to this terrible experience. (Also, whoever "shopped" for my online order gave me Mango, when I ordered Peaches, without flagging it was a replacement, so it looks like they just weren't paying attention. I'm allergic to Mango! Please do better.)< /text>< Time>

Summary:
This is a nice Whole Foods in a good location next to highway 101. Lines can be long at times, but the selection of food is always in stock and the staff is helpful. You can return Amazon purchases here.

Food:
If you’re looking for a speciality item, you will likely find it here. The shelves are always stocked and they have good inventory management.

Customer Service:
They also have an Amazon return counter, so you can return Amazon purchases directly here and your refund hits sometimes in a matter of hours. There is never a line at this counter, which is great. The staff here is always super nice and attentive.

The only thing I will knock a star for is line management. I often find lines here since they’re very busy and it’s during Covid-19.< /text>

Very nice location. It has big selection of meats and cheeses. But you will hardly find good fresh coffee here: usually whole foods have decent assortment, but not this one.
At the same time there is huge amount of different grains and other stuff in dispensers.
For Amazon prime members there are always some nice deals.<//Text>

Generally a comfortable place to shop while social distancing. Employees are helpful and respectful. Other than those things that are hard to find generally (certain cleaning supplies, etc), the store is pretty well stocked. The meat counter usually has a pretty good selection of you can't find what you are looking for I the refrigerators.<//Review>

Whole foods is great, but unfortunately the store seemed empty. I really sympathize with the workers who must be stocking shelves day and night with food only for everyone to pick the shelves clean the next day.  I'm finding it really hard to find everything I need at one grocery store these days.< /Text>

This is a wonderful spot!! We have the best looking fruits and vegetables in any market I've visited. I tried some of the cheeses and salads. OMG, they all had a home made taste. DELIQUIRE!!</text>

<text>The attendants are always friendly and courteous. They do a good job putting it in my trunk nicely and everything is packaged properly in the bags. This location gets bonus points for the Gong-cha located in the same plaza so I swing by there whenever I get groceries.

On the negative side, there have been issues where they give me the wrong item or a bad item (yogurt cup was cracked open). However, asking for a return/refund on the app is super easy and they always refund me, no questions asked without even having to return the item.

There is a another Whole Foods that opened nearer to me but it does not offer curbside pick up, nor does it have a Gong-cha in the same plaza. For those reasons alone, I will continue to go here.</text>< userid>

I appreciate the efforts this particular store has gone through to make everyone as safe as possible from catching Covid.  However, the way they fulfill pickup orders for their new curb-side service has greatly degraded the experience of in-store shoppers.

Instead of pulling the pickup orders from the stock in the back, there is an army of paid workers "shopping" the storefront.  These paid workers rarely ever pay attention to social distancing, often blocking aisles while they stare at their phones trying to figure out what the customer wants, or coming right up to breathe down your neck while you're grabbing something yourself.  They all leave a cart in front of the coffee and tea shelves, forcing customers to move carts out of the way to get those products.  And the final aggravation is all the bare shelves as many staple items are getting pulled to fill orders and not being restocked.

All these problems could be simply fixed by having their workers fulfill orders from the stock in the back.  Until this happens though, I'm no longer going to drive out of my way to come to this particular store.<//review>< pictures>

<review>one of the things I like about whole foods is having the bulk section so you can pick and choose as much of the ingredients that you like or enjoy or need to make that special recipe or just to get a chance to taste something a little different you know open up your options. A new day to try something new and fresh and don't forget the ethnic options of foods and vegetarian stuff.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

A long line at the entrance, but after entering, it seems the store occupancy is still pretty high. If you just need to do Amazon return here, you still need to stand in the line at entrance.< /Review>

Love this new Whole Foods.  It’s got a nice seating area with a beer bar.  Good comfy furniture.  Clean, friendly servers
Food is slightly better quality than other Whole Foods.
Much better ambiance than the San Jose Whole Foods (that one doesn’t even have an indoor seating area)
They have a taproom inside with TVs. Grab a slice of pizza, sit down and have a beer ($1 off 4-6 M-F)
I had the Brussels sprouts for $5 500 cal</Text>

<Text>A bar at Wholefoods? Who'd have thought! The setting is relaxed, with most patrons being office and tech workers from the neighbouring buildings. There is also a cafe in the store as well as a pizza stand and the usual hot and cold self-serve food. A spacious, clean and new Wholefoods.<//Text>< pics>

Oh boy what a shop. Loved it. The way it was set out and served it's produce to all the things it had to sell was great. So many options from vegan to free from and dairy free as well as organic local produce. Also liked you could buy a lot of things without wrappers. Cafe on the side was good as well. Liked you could buy in the shop and eat in the cafe. Love to go back to it as much as I could.<//Text>

<Text>I just love their "vegan pineapple" I come all the way here just for that. You can't find vegan labelled pineapple at many other places so it's a real treat that they offer it here. They also have some other fruit such as cantelope and honeydew but they're not vegan labelled. I try to stick to vegan fruits only but nobody's perfect. Come by and try it, you'll probably see me there!<//Text><response>None</response><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

I usually do all my shopping here,  but last night on a date night, we stopped at the bar here, being a lover of craft beer I wanted to try the beer at the bar. ☹️ sadly I was disappointed I got a taster of the top 4  beers 2 where really good when I was ready to order a beer, the bartender he said oh sorry ask her for help even though he poured them for me, long story short there service is bad.  We left after this because there service didn’t seem like I wanted to be there I could have easily stood there longer how ever I felt a bit discriminated against.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

They do have a nice selection of cakes du jour but don't try and order something in advance.... that doesn't happen.  Still the overall store is well stocked and a great variety of good groceries to choose from.</review>< Rating>

< Review>
This is a large Whole Foods with an extra big salad bar section. Ready to go food includes pizza, ramen, burritos and acai bowls. There's also a bar here that pours craft beer!! Parking is a bit of a wreck to find, but not impossible. Overall, awesome!!< /Review>

First time I visited Whole foods. Overall prices are bit higher than other stores. May be that is over all their standard in pricing. Otherwise store is pretty organized and clean. Fresh vegetables and fruits.< /review>

This whole foods is dope.  I dropped my wallet somewhere in produce, and didn't realize it until I hit the baked goods.  When I was frantically searching the floor around the produce section, one of the dudes working there noticed and said "I just gave a wallet to customer service".  CLUTCH.

I love this store. It's really New not even a year old. They do have a wide variety of  organic & healthy food and food to go. I like how there is a beer bar. Also the pastries are to  die for and for someone like me trying to be healthy they do have a variety of kumbacha.< /Text>

<text>Well, it's hard to say anything except marvelous things about a store that houses so many healthy goods, not to mention the food that is ready and available in the morning.  The breads are fresh and the one we loved so much (coconut) isn't made anymore, it was a Friday favorite.  I love the availability of the fresh fruit.  The prices...well, you do get what you paid for.  The clerks are always friendly and greet you with a smile.  Love that.<//text>< Pictures>

review is for the sandwich bar.

do not use it unless you want to waste your time. The employees do not care at all. 30 minute wait at best. this review is because the person trashed my order form and went on break so I waited 30 minutes for absolutely nothing.<//Text>

DO NOT ORDER CAKE AT WHOLE FOODS!!

I had a very bad experience with whole foods bakery for my 30th birthday. From a week in advance, I had ordered a custom cake for a group of 50. I double checked with the staff at whole foods bakery for several times and they told me they do not give any receipt for picking up the cake and as long as my friend gives them my name they will give the cake to her. So I made all the payments in advance as they asked me to do so. On Saturday morning, my friend called them and they confirmed over phone the cake is ready and she can pick it up in the afternoon. But when she showed up there, they told her that they do not have any order under my name. So we ended up getting some cake quickly from another random store with totally different design than what I had in mind.</Review>

<Review>The biggest, best whole foods in the area. Been to several in silicon valley, and I'm amazed at how nice this place is. First, the layout is wide open and comfortable. The produce section is fresh and easy on the eyes. The wine, beer and liquor is pretty unreal, the seafood is *curated* (literally, the shrimp is stacked in packed rows). And there is an incredible set of food spots and tap room along one end. All very nice, all well maintained and the staff is equally courteous.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I spend anywhere from 300 to 700 a week in Whole Foods. I shop exclusively at Whole Foods. I came into the Santa Clara store this morning to eat breakfast and wanted to use the restroom first. However, when I went into the restroom there was feces on one of the urinals and on the toilet. I immediately went to the nearest cashier and told them. I then went to the food bar and got my breakfast, sadly no Vegan options, got a juice and went to the cashier and paid for my meal. While I am eating my meal in the cafe I am being stared at by both what I later found out is the manager and the maintenance person. I finish my meal, and attempt to use the restroom only to find that it still smells like feces and there is still some on the toilet. I complained again and walked around the store for a moment. When I went back. It still stunk but I used the restroom. AS I am washing my hands two police officer walk in and ask me for my ID. Apparently the Store Manager called the police, as he assumed "by my appearance" that I had stolen the food and had made the mess in the bathroom. He also assumed that I was either vagrant or homeless. I work for living, I make a good living at it. I do not look homeless and the police officers even stated as such. I was issued a trespass warning this morning in a Whole Foods in Santa Clara CA and I was asked to not come back in. All because of the assumption of the manager. Who instead of being human and asking a question, decided to assume and call the police. The police officer were extremely nice. But this Whole Foods, I will never visit it again. I will go 50 miles out of my way and park my 35ft truck 10 blocks from a store to buy food, but this one... Nope, never again. You need better training of your staff, especially management.< /review>< Pictures>

The Taproom at this Whole Foods is awesome. Great beer selection. Beers tastes fresh. Good sized and priced beer flights. You can always walk to the food section to buy food and eat at the bar if you don’t like the bar food (which I didn’t like hence took a star off)<//Review>

I love their selection of fresh flowers. Prices are lower than other grocery stores and the flowers look way fresher! The even have a florist counter where you can get a custom bouquet made. :)

I also bought avocados fairly cheap. Prices comparable to Mexican grocery store prices.< /text>

This Whole Foods opened rather recently.  It seems that each new Whole Foods has to outdo the others.  This Santa Clara location certain does that with their bar and dining area.  Once I was there on a  Thursday after 8pm and the place was packed!  It definitely the place to be for the time being.  I usually go to Whole Foods for their prepared foods section.  They certainly had lots to offer, but haven’t found any favorites yet.  No fault of them, but I’ll continue to go other Whole Foods locations closer to me.

UPDATE:
After giving this location a few more tries, I finally give up.  What's the point when I can't even find a place to park?  I would suggest avoiding the lunch rush, after work rush, weekend rush, the 8pm on a random night rush, etc.  If you manage to get inside, the place is slammed with people.  I suppose it's good for business, but not great for a leisurely shopping experience.< /text>

I've been a patron of numerous whole foods and have loved them on almost every occasion. Until today, I ate some sushi from here and currently in the throes of a hardcore food poisoning meltdown. Sorry Whole Foods, my food poisoning rule is stringent. Never again.</text>

I love this Wholefoods tucked away off Bowers. It's in a very new shopping complex that's meant to cater to the large apartment complex being built next to it. Currently,  footfall is less than what you'd expect, which is good for me because I enjoy shopping without being overcrowded.  Only downside is that the apt construction messes with traffic sometimes.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Whole Foods as a franchise is one of my favorite grocery stores.  The employees at this location are friendly and helpful.  Checkout lines are never too long and parking is plentiful. There's a really cute beer lounge connected to the store.  It's a nice place to sit with food from the hot foods section or grab a beer with friends.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

A nice new whole foods with a restaurant attached. Not too crowded a parking lot, at least at the times I have been there. Great selection of pretty much everything you can imagine and they have a lot of prepared foods that you can take to go as well as having the restaurant. If you're looking for a really nice Whole Foods to stop at it's not too far off of the freeway in Santa Clara so you can make a quick stop if you need to go somewhere else because there isn't that much around there.</Review>

Whole foods is the best. Prices are a bit high but it is worth it. At this location the parking is a major issue. The staff are nice in most of the store. Burritos need to be made by people who know how to roll them.</review>

<Review>This is my favorite grocery shopping store. Aparr from the variety and quality of different things it is also very accessible from the San Jose , Santa Clara area. They have a wide variety of items from lots of fresh veggies, fruits, flours, seeds, sauces to different blinds of spirits and liquors as well. There is an Amazon pick up locker as well inside the store. Not to mention having the Amazon visa rewards card gives you 5% cash back on all purchases. They also have a pretty decent cafeteria and bar. Great for lunch or just coffee and hanging out.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Fantastic Whole Foods! This location is probably the largest in the South Bay or Peninsula with a wide variety of items which we had to previously visit multiple Whole Foods to find.

Appearance is the standard Irvine Company appeal - very upscale but still welcoming.

Even with most other stores in the shopping center still under construction, parking was a challenge. Something I hope is remedied once the center is completed.<//Review>

It's whole foods. You either love it or you only tolerate it. Whole Foods tends to attract a very particular (read: opinionated) crowd, but that's not the point. The food is just okay in my opinion, but their selection is wide and the overall atmosphere of the place is welcoming. The staff is very friendly, which is a big plus.< /Text>

Very laid back environment (and I mean their cafe/bar) and nice settings. As any other whole foods, a ton of healthy options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They have a four cheese bread which is a killer. I think different stores specialize in different breads and food bars, and the four cheese bread here is a must.</review>< pictures>

Their reusable tote bags are surprisingly affordable at $2 for a set. Finding parking in the afternoon is difficult.<//Text>< username>

I have to say I was really glad when I heard Whole Foods was coming to Santa Clara. The building is brand new and really nice, the tap room is also a great place. But in the end it is a small Whole Foods compared to the other ones in the Bay Area. The cheese, meat and fish selections are definitely smaller than I anticipated...</text>

This place is perfect. A very big and well organized whole foods store. Staff is helpful. You get almost everything you need in your kitchen.  Overpriced, but thats kind of premium for organic food.</Review>

<text>Great store with a lot of good people working for it! I had the pleasure of meeting Shaun in produce who was very helpful in selecting asparagus tips and Mallory (butchering the name :0) in bakery department who was very knowledgeable and very nice. Great store experience mixed with good employees makes this place a regular place for me to stop at.<//text><Rating>5< /Rating><Response>None</Response><user_id>115048983003570533087</user_id><Name>Robert Sanchez<//Name><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

This is THE PLACE for all of us who want to get fresh, healthy and high quality food. This location was never super crowed even on weekends and has a large variety of items. Parking is easy.Just don't expect the cheapest price (as an example, you can find Avalon Organics Shampoo 35% cheaper online.</Text>

I bought a veggie burrito here last night. When I tried to eat it for lunch, found that it was actually a meat burrito. I called them to let them know, the lady who answered pretended to not understand what I was saying. I said: I bought a vegetarian burrito and got a meat burrito. Do you understand this is a problem? She finally said, yes this is a problem, you can bring the receipt to the store and we'll give you a refund.

How about the missed lunch and stinking up the oven?< /text>

<review>This Whole Foods has done a horrific job of managing their parking lot. During the weekdays you can not park for morning until 8 or 9 pm. The parking situation is an ugly mess and extremely unfriendly to customers.

Also I want to note that on the weekends, although there are even more customers in the whole foods than during the weekdays, parking is not a problem. There are PLENTY of spaces.

So what's going on?</review><Resp>None</Resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

It's really big and has everything you need to buy from a grocery store. But I go there most the time for their salad bar and food. It's over crowded for lunch but you can find spot to sit and take your meal.<//Review>

I couldn't find a reasonable healthy lunch here so I had to go to Starbucks a block over.  Seriously let's think about this...I couldn't get a healthy lunch at a whole foods.  Whole foods?!? Everything is loaded in ranch or Mayo or curry or deep fried or covered in sugary sauces. It's disgusting and really weird. I guess I have to go to Starbucks now for my whole foods?</text>

Location and building is great. Had no parking issue so far. Only thing is Staff in deli and behind other food counter didn't seem professional and polite at all. Not like any other Whole Foods at least where staff is usually much more lively and helpful. Felt like they were not trained well< /Text>

If I am paying a high price for groceries, I want the quality to be fresh. On 3 different occasions, the oranges were literally rotten. I came back a couple days later to see if they had replaced the bags of oranges but the same rotten oranges were still there. There was literally mold that had touched my hand and was dripping from the bag of oranges. I let the staff that was in that section know about the oranges and he only removed some bags while the other practically rotten bags were still there. Honestly all of the oranges should have been taken out since they were all scrunched together in mold and contaminated. i was so disappointed. Why would you still be trying to make a buck out of rotten oranges, just get new ones. Those same rotten oranges were consitently there on 4 different occasions. This is whole foods, people shouldn't have to beg for their food to be fresh. I was also disappointed that they did not have an organic brand of papaya but rather an over priced cost for a genetically modified brand. Other than that this grocery store was okay for other things besides some stuff in their fruit section. I honestly was appalled that the staff worker still was trying to sell rotten oranges after I had told him about it. Like when I touched that section, my hand was literally dripping in mold. My advice is better staff training and more crack downs on reviewing which produce is still fresh and what isnt. I could have gotten sick from touching all that mold, that was literally ridiculous. Its one thing if a couple fruits are rotten but this was literally like every single bag of orange was molded and turning black and some were dripping in mold. This is not a cheap market where people should try to sell as much as possible even if it means selling your customers molded items when clearly that whole section is rotten. This is whole foods and quality should be a priority.< /Text>

Good collection of organic fruits, vegetables and meat. 365 organic skinless boneless chicken @4.99$/lb is cheap. Wild caught full fish available which they clean and give without additional cost. a2milk 1%,2% and whole milk available.<//Text>

So glad there's a Whole Foods near me now. Lots of great options in a well maintained store. Cashiers are always very friendly. I much prefer grocery shopping here than Safeway which I was doing prior to this opening.<//Review>

This is for the bao/ramen place only. The bao buns we're gelatinous and inedible. There was no fillings other than a piece of lettuce and 2 small slices of green onions, and a bit of sauce. The ramen was absolutely flavorless. Save your money and get food elsewhere.</review>

Huge breath of fresh air for this part of Santa Clara. Tap room concept huge success and is a welcome addition in terms of boosting social scene. WF appears to be the anchor tenant for this Irvine Company development. Love the salad bar, baristas are fast... plentiful parking. Good place for casual rendezvous with friends, popular low key business lunch spot.<//Review>

One of my favorite supermarket/grocery store in this area. Very clean, staffs are very friendly. Fresh products (vegetables, meat, fish, etc.) are a bit pricey compared to other stores but they are good. おすすめ。<//Text>

I love whole foods for its breads, mochi ice cream, vegetables, cakes etc. Although expensive the quality is great. This is one of their newest stores. You can also charge your car here although it might be difficult to get a spot due to it's popularity.<//Text>

Last visit finished with extra $15 spent on stuff we didn’t even have in our shoping cart. I was surprised to see bunch of items we actually never buy... after I took casual look into receipt. My bad... I have no idea what cachier was thinking that moment, but from now I gonna ask for receipt every time, if I have to shop there. Will try to avoid this place after all.<//Text>

Some may of course argue that they are a bit overpriced, yea probably, but things are so organized here, the variety of organic options are plentiful.

Other than $17 for 2 beers and a kids juice box, everything is excellent. Great to grab a drink before going to the market, watch the game, get some food. Lots of TV's for the game, comfy seating along the wall, nice tables for groups.</text>

This is our most local WF, so we go there the most, but it isn't as suited to our preferences as The Alemeda location.  This location opens at 8AM, and closes at 10PM, which aren't the best hours.
I've dealt with the fish department multiple times, and have been disappointed by the service, the care of my order, and the quality of the fish.  The last time I ended up throwing out 20% when I got home because it smelled too fishy; and I'm not picky about this.
The hot bar selections haven't changed in a couple months, and there aren't any warm fish selections.  Also, the hot bar is getting to be too expensive, $8.99 for a lot of non-organic options.
The produce section is a little cramped, but the options are good, although it'd be nice if the "local" options were also organic.  It's great they're supporting local, but shouldn't we also be supporting fresh local water and soil?
The bulk section is clean and well stocked.  There aren't as many organic options, so be careful to read the label.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Being very particular about eating Organic food, I always choose Whole foods to buy Organic veggies because, I feel the quality is much better than any other market. If you know what is reasonably priced and what's not at Whole Foods, it'll be a great marketplace to shop for Groceries. Their salad bar/sandwiches are also great. SantaClara branch is at a  pretty convenient location close to most places in Sunnyvale, North Sanjose and Santa Clara.< /text>< pictures>

Every time Whole Foods builds a new store they seem to get more chic and more eclectic.  This place has one heck of sports bar in which to enjoy the healthiest French fries on the planet.</review>

< Review>
This Whole Foods distinguishes itself from the others by having a sports bar? On one side of the market you can find a high ceiling space where you can buy a beer or a coffee and watch a baseball, basketball or football game while eating an organic kale salad! Like other WF this one is very well organized, spotlessly clean and offer great selection of organic and artisanal foods. Nothing new there.< /Review>

<Text>30 minutes to get a sandwich. Good job!

UPD! Not in the morning)) in the morning you’ll just get no sandwich since there is no limit for perfection.

Actually the entire store does not really work till 8 am. Yes, you can grab smthg from the shelf, but do not expect any further service - all the coffee&deli options are just not there or heavily limited.

UPD2: on weekends it is better - the deli looks as intended also in the early morning: it is fully functional and the entire selection is usually available.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x808fc9f208a428e9:0xc3f7aa7b9e59dcc9< /gmapID><Rating>1</Rating></record></dataset><record>

Most poorly stocked WF I've ever been to. Everything I looked for either wasn't carried, wasn't stocked, or wasn't being cooked that day. What store doesn't have wings on a Sunday during football season?? Terrible waste of time. Go elsewhere.< /Text>

It's a WholeFoods. They have their own bakery in house, which would usually be a good thing. Unfortunately their bread's not great, and it prevents then from stocking any of the good breads they have in e.g. the San Jose store.<//review>

Okay this Whole Foods basically kills every other Whole Foods I've ever been to. No joke notwithstanding even the one in San Francisco this is the whole foods that looks like it's the flagship super mega awesome store.   I'm telling you Batman shops here.  Now I'm a big fan of pizza this Whole Foods has at least five to six different pies always there and this is like I think at one or two maybe it was around like 11 or 12 I don't know but this selection of pizza was just out of this world.  And unlike some of the other Whole Foods that basically try to force down this vegan cheese stuff and everything like that they don't bother they no vacancies just does not taste good.  Not only that but my God the people are super friendly there's a bar there I mean there's outdoor seating the WiFi is fast there's outdoor plugs even I mean I'm telling you this is exactly what going to A Whole Foods supposed to be like.  The only gripe I ever have about the Whole Foods in California is that their soups aren't really all kept together which is kind of weird but I think they do that for allergy reasons or something like the clam chowder is always way over there with the chili is and the rest of the soup is over there with salbar is Cecily that's weird to me but other than that everything is awesome< /text>

Best Whole Foods market in the valley. It’s also right next to an independent bookstore. I especially like the salad bar and the self service pizza counter.</text>

<review>The Hot Bar is large for a WF. (The dining area in general offers a number of really great in-store restaurants). Unfortunately I find the food in the hot bar particularly bad for a Whole Foods. IMO, unless you're going for a salad, avoid the Hot Bar area.</review>< GmapID>

<Review>I'm as pretentious as the next guy. I don't mind spending a bit more for quality food. But this is getting ridiculous. For the price of bananas here, you could have strawberries, or at least apples, anywhere else. At least their "ready to eat" section is larger than most restaurants so there is that.<//Review>< pictures>

Not sure what the problem is, he should have said that he dint cleaned. Very disappointed :( :( :(</Text>< pictures>

I am glad that they opened this location. Before, the closest one to my house was the one close to Downtown San Jose. I  am not a frequent buyer of this super market. But from time to time, I like to try something from the hot-breakfast area.</Review>

<review>The whole foods market is ok, just like other WF. Checkout is a breeze but some cashiers have no idea of taking the bag discount when ppl bring their own bags.
The parking lot is a pain! During lunch time, lots of cars get into the small plaza. Some drivers have little courtesy and are negligent of rules when fighting for parking spaces that others have been waiting for. WF/Amazon should invest more in a bigger land around this market and build a better parking lot.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>One of the nicest Whole Foods I've been in. I know they are all relatively similar, but I really enjoy the cheese and beer selections. The food choices are pretty substantial with burritos, sandwiches, ramen bowls, sushi, pizza and all of the other salad and hot food bars you'd typically expect. Check out their mochi selection for dessert. There is a quaint bar at the front side of the store that serves food and lets you bring in food from the store. It can get a little loud, but there are games on the TV's, and most of the tables are made from reclaimed trees that were on the property before the store was built. Prices are definitely high for a grocery store, but it's what comes with shopping at Whole Foods.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This is not my usual Whole Foods but I checked it out shortly after it opened. It's the only one I know of that has a mochi $20-for-two-dozen section. You pick them out like you would pick out your food at the hot bar. I come here for my sister who loves mochi, but have no reason otherwise to make the trip. Nice enough and in line with the Los Altos and Cupertino locations.<//Text>

One of the newest WF stores in the area. Very large store. Everything is still new and clean. All the standard WF offerings, coffee bar, hot dish, sushi, supplements, etc. The only downside to this location is that it has difficult car access. You have to drive around the mulberry bush to get in or out of the parking lot. My pet peeve with this store, and all WF stores for that matter, is that pedestrians are forced to walk directly through the worst of the parking lot traffic to get in or out of the store. To me, that is an extremely dangerous recipie for disaster and puts shoppers at undue risk.</Text>

Fresh hot NAAN ! Wow !
The pizza by the slice it's not usually burnt like it is at the Blossom Hill location. Try the blue cheese Mozzarella pizza slice.

Good location right off of 101.
Easy parking.  The store layout is logical and efficient.
The hot food bar, coffee bar, mini cafés, deli, pastries, Bakery, grab-n-go items, and Quick Check-out stations(10 of 'em), are all clustered together near the entrance-exit...which makes for a quick getaway when us mortals are on our limited 15 minute or 30 minute lunch or breakfast break.
Seating at indoor or outdoor tables, plus indoor counter seating.
Adjacent tap room has bar seating or tables.

Free idea:💭
why doesn't WF build stand alone food court operations in some locations ?

Good selection of food @ hot bar.
In the pastry case look for the almond thumb print cookies they are da bomb.</text>

Not as nice as the Cupertino location, but good enough to get most items. Fish counter and butcher area are both about half the size of the Cupertino location so if you're looking for a specific cut of meat or fish you may not find it here.</text>

This Whole Foods has a huge selection of pre made food even at 8:00AM.  Terrible parking if you go in the evening.  Not enough parking for everything located in this area.  Not u common to circle around for a half an hour and still find no parking.  Time to build a parking garage.< /Text>

A nice, albeit expensive, addition to the neighborhood!

I mistakenly purchased, then returned, a bar of soap, thinking it cost only $1.50. Turns out it was $1.50 per ounce, making the bar almost $7.00!< /review>

The only problem: it is too crowdy sometimes that you hardly find a place to park, they probably need more short-time parking spots<//review>

<text>This store is poorly managed. There are long lines for checkouts. Even when the express line wraps around into the rest of the store, they keep just two cashiers open. This happens at Safeway too, but not Trader Joe's.</text>< userid>

It is a modern American market and has a great variety of Deli ingredients. You can pick up the Box and choose your favorite food. I think it's a particularly good place for vegetarians, as the variety is wider than other stores. There are many kinds of olives. There is also an area where cheese is cut on the spot. Rich in nuts and cereals, you can make your own original. What surprised me was the machine that made peanut butter on the spot, and I saw this machine for the first time at this shop. Should I call it fresh peanut butter? There is a small refrigerator on top of the machine and peanut butter, which you may have already made with the same machine, so you can buy it without making it yourself. There are many types of supplements and medicines. There are quite a lot of seats in the eat-in corner, so you can immediately eat what you bought. There is also a casual restaurant on the right side of the store where you can drink beer.

とても清潔感のあるマーケット。今風のアメリカ系マーケットで、Deli系食材がとても豊富。Boxを手に取り好きな食べ物を自ら選んで入れることができる。種類が他のお店より豊富なのでベジタリアンには特にいい場所だと思う。オリーブも種類が豊富。チーズもその場でカットしてくれるエリアもあり。ナッツやシリアルも豊富で自分だけのオリジナルが作れる。特に驚いたのがピーナッツバターをその場で作れるマシーンもあって、このマシーンはこのお店で初めて見た。フレッシュピーナッツバターと呼ぶべきかな？マシーンの上には小さい冷蔵庫があって既に同じマシーンで作ったと思われるピーナッツバターが置いてあるので、わざわざ自分で製造せずに買うこともできる。サプリメントやお薬のコーナーも種類が豊富。イートインコーナーも結構席が多くて購入したものをその場ですぐに食べられる。店内の右側にはカジュアルレストランもあってビールも飲める。</review><gmap_id>0x808fc9f208a428e9:0xc3f7aa7b9e59dcc9</gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><user_id>109256490093469094866< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>(Translated by Google) It's easy to find because it's located in Santa Clara Square.
Of course, the store is large, and the inside is very clean.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are ready, and Deli section keeps smelling delicious, so it's hard to go shopping.
Parking is also convenient if you avoid the busy lunch break. Above all, I like Amazon Prime discount because it's very much!

Fresh fruits and vegetables are prepared, and the deli corner keeps smelling delicious, making shopping difficult. Parking is also convenient if you avoid the busy lunch time. Most of all, I like it because there are quite a few prime discounts on Amazon!

산타클라라 스퀘어에 자리하고 있어서 찾아가기가 쉬운 곳. 매장은 당연히 넓고, 내부는 엄청 깨끗합니다. 신선한 과일과 채소가 준비되어 있고, 델리코너에서는 맛있는 냄새가 계속 나서 쇼핑할 때 힘들어요. 한창 바쁜 점심시간만 피한다면 주차 또한 편하구요. 무엇보다 아마존 프라임 할인이 꽤 있어서 맘에 들어요!</text>< date>

(Translated by Google) It ’s easy to shop! There are plenty of daily necessities other than food, and you may find that protein and other products are sold at a great price! I think that it is a nice point because the quality can be trusted. The fresh orange juice is worth a try. The ramen is instant noodle style and I couldn't stop feeling fast food ...

買い物しやすいところです！食品以外の日用品も充実していて意外にもプロテイン等がお得に売っていることがあります！品質が信頼出来るので嬉しいポイントだと思います。オレンジ生搾りジュースは試す価値あり✨ラーメンはインスタント麺風でファストフード感否めなかったです…<//Text>
