He has been very kind from the beginning of this process. Making everything easy while helping straighten my teeth with aligners. The staff is also awesome, very patient, and they work so well with your schedule! I personally love that I get a text message sent to remind me of my appointments (I think it’s a great bonus!). I always recommend BRO for any orthodontic needs.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1620925941737, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words, we are happy to hear you’ve enjoyed your experience with us and love having you in the BRO family.'}<//response><gmapID>0x80dcf3e29e027733:0xa81e6c839b51c0d1</gmapID></record>

Both of my children have received orthodontic treatment from Dr. Bill Redmond.  He is skilled, personable, and fun!  He provides excellent care and strives to connect with each patient on a personal level.  Dr. Bill Redmond and his team also go above and beyond to make a contributions to their community.  I would highly recommend BRO Orthodontics!< /Review>

<review>The thing we love most about BRO is that Dr. Bill made the effort to bond with our 8-year-old at the beginning of the process. It could have been scary for him but instead he looks forward to his appointments. The whole staff is friendly and efficient. Go BRO!</review>< pics>

The whole staff is great!  Every person we encountered at the San Clemente office was lovely.   Even during this weird time we are in, everyone was pleasant and happy.   Our consultation with Bill was exceptional!    He listens.  He talks to the patient and not just the parent.   He doesn’t rush.   He has a great sense of humor which always makes things better!<//Review>

<Review>BRO is truly the best. Not only is Dr. Redmond an incredible orthodontist, his staff is also one of a kind. Not only have they walked my 12 year old (and I) through the step by step process of braces, but they’ve always been accommodating to me when my 4 year old comes along to appointments!! I feel so very lucky that we crossed paths and are part of the BRO family.<//Review><Time>1592502960129<//Time>< Pics>

Direct diagnosis and explanations of services required.

Customer service is very friendly. Employees work overtime to allow patients to after hours treatment. They perform their duties without expressing
any negative attitude.

Prices were direct and based off of their analysis, plus no haggling occurred.

Scheduled an appointment that morning and received my initial scans for invsaline within an hour of arriving at the office.

Affordable payment plans are offered.

So far, I haven't had any hidden fees thrown my way since starting treatment.

Thorough brief for treatments. Be sure you listen and bring a highlighter mark important information.</Text>

So glad I bought my daughter to Dr. Bill!  He is a perfectionist as well as an artist. It's extremely apparent from your first visit that Dr. Redmond and his staff care about you as a person. They are easy to work with on rescheduling and the waiting room should be called a sitting room because we never have to wait!  That's my kind of orthodontist!  You'd be crazy to go anywhere else.</review>

<Review>Dr. Bill is amazing; I recommend him without any hesitation. I have a son with down Syndrome and sensory issues. We had seen a different Ortho for a while who was beyond insensitive to my son and didn't even correct his dental issues so when we were searching for a new Ortho to start over, I did a lot of research and interviewing. Dr. Bill has gone above and beyond expectations: he made several house calls (yes, really!), took extra time at each appointment, really got to know my son and made him feel so comfortable. Now my son, who was initially terrified of orthodontist appointments, is calm and compliant and always looks forward to seeing Dr. Bill! We are so grateful for him and his very kind staff!</Review>< GmapID>

Unfortunately, his treatment contributed to bone loss in the condyles of my mandible, facial pain, intrusion of my molars, and the narrowing of my face and jaw, among other problems. I am now, many years later, undergoing functional orthodontics to correct the work he and other traditional orthodontists did. Every day I'm in less pain and my face improves as my prior treatment is reversed. I do not mean to be inflammatory or disparaging. I have no doubt that Dr. Redmond wants the best possible outcomes for his patients. However, my diagnosis was incorrect and resulted in a poor outcome that only got worse over time.<//text>< rate>

< review>
I ordered a saddle man seat for my motorcycle from Born Scum. Process was iffy trying to check out and actually order the seat with payment style and poorly made website. Unless I’m blind/not looking in the right spot on their website, there was no indication it would take 1-2 weeks to process the order, 8-12 weeks to process the seat, and god knows how long it’s gonna take to ship. (Since it’s still in the seat processing stage) I’ve reached out to their customer support/contact us location. They do not answer phone calls and only use automated emails until you email them 3+ times with the SAME QUESTION. Horrible customer service, crazy long time for “processing”, and overall bad experience. I tried getting my money back after a week of contacting them asking where my statuses were BEFORE the order was processed but they ignored it until it was too late, since seats are customizable. My fault for not doing more research into this company but if I can save anyone else all the trouble I’ve been put through with ordering a motorcycle seat with them, it’s all worth it.

Order number: 56579

I will update review upon arrival of seat.</review>

<review>I know have 5 shirts and my Harley is decked out with stickers, even though it takes a little while to ship, it’s totally worth the wait, all of the prints on the T-shirts are super clean and the quality of fabric is just as good, anyone that rides a Harley should wear this brand #BornScumCult</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Purchased a few shirts from them back in September they arrived promptly and fit like a glove. So much so I ordered an additional 6 shirts. These guys are awesome stand by their product and their customer service is unmatched. You can text them directly. They are always very willing to answer questions and are always cool. I will most definitely  continue ordering from them.</review><gmap_id>0x80ea5dadde4380d1:0x784c4c3da3b15213<//gmap_id><user>113362379410397510169<//user><username>Mat Rojas< /username><Response>{'time': 1602115159374, 'text': "Thank you Mat!

If I could give them a zero I would. I ordered $80 worth of stuff on December 18, 2019.....it is now February 4, 2020 and still no sign of my order. I was told it was getting shipped out on 1/20, then I was told it was getting shipped out on 1/27. It arrived at a Post Office on 1/31 in White Plains NY (about 2 hours from me) from CA and I checked the tracking this morning and it’s BACK IN CALIFORNIA!!!!

Do not buy from this company, it’s clear they have no idea what they are doing. It takes 3 minutes to make a t-shirt. It does not take over a month.< /Review>

It's currently September 17th. No tracking number or anything, but they sure did take my money already. Crazy thing is that the warehouse and I are are in the same city.
Had super high hopes for this company because it's local, I feel let down.</Review><rating>1< /rating>< pics>

They provided great customer service when i messed up and ordered the same shirt twice. Prompt response and correction to my error. Shirts are sized correctly, even for a 6'2", 300 lb guy. I will be buying more in the future. If they would offer an endorsement type program for musicians, i would flip. We would rock these shirts at every gig.</Text>

<Text>Love this company!!! Absolutely worth ordering. They’re a small business and I couldn’t be happier with the items I have received! Being a small business who does all their own printing and shipping is so sick! The owners are very helpful, responded in a timely manner, shipped my goods and offered up any extra info I needed to look to on the site for the future. They let me know if I had any questions or what not I can personally speak to them. Genuine and awesome company. Thank you Born Scum clothing for the rad new clothes!!!!</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I ordered over two months ago. Sent an email at about the 2 week mark because I had been tracking my order and saw that I still hadn't shipped. I thought it was a long time being that the order was just a few shirts and stickers. The email I got in return seemed rude and defensive. Used the pandemic and being a small operation as an excuse. I've ordered other things from all over the country and received my orders in a timely fashion. Born Scum is 3 hours from my house. So, I waited another few weeks and still nothing. Sent multiple emails and texts through their website all to no avail. Very frustrated. Feeling like I got robbed for my $137 + change purchase. Sadly in hindsight I see a lot of other people have been treated the same way in the comments. I highly do not reccomend and I will be taking legal action indefinitely.< /review>

Found out about this company from a friend. Awesome designs, so I ordered a couple. Arrived within three days of my order. Opening the package I found the 3 shirts, exactly what I ordered(yes, I've gotten the wrong shirts before). Designs were as expected in terms of quality. I'm 6' with an average build, size and fit is absolutely perfect with a large. I've spent more money on lower quality shirts, there is absolutely zero disappointment here. Also got a badass sticker in my order too, which will find its way onto my toolbox to piss people off. Will definitely buy more in the future.<//Review>

I really don’t write reviews at all but saw an email from born scum clothing asking how they did. Simply put I ordered my item on a Friday night and it showed up immediately on Monday morning. It wasn’t the amount of value the item had or the size. Just the fact that it was at my door immediately the next business day without paying any additional shipping charges A+ and item was as expected. Thanks!< /text>

This is a great company. I have made 3 separate orders now. All three orders arrived on time and exactly what I ordered. No issues what so ever. The quality of the all products is A++. The shirts fit perfectly and they are made with great material “not cheap”  I also ordered a seat for my street glide. The seat was delivered super fast and I could not be happier with it. A+++ everything. I love this company and will continue to support them!<//Text>

Kinda sketched out. I got in contact by customer support asking about the seat i was wanting to order. After talking to them I went ahead and put my $5 deposit to have the seat made how I wanted it. In the description it said to put in the notes how I wanted it. I didn’t see a notes section to do that. Then I tried to contact the customer service that I’ve been talking to and they will not answer me back text email by phone nothing. Would like a response.<//text>

Great quality t-shirts and caps. Print on the t-shirts is as perfect as the day I got them and the stitching on the cap is fantastic quality. Delivery from the USA even to the UK has been pretty quick and the customer service has been great when I've queried a couple of things before ordering. Will definitely be buying more. 👍<//review>

Love supporting small business! Ordered a couple of shirts and a hat near Christmas time so I figured since it was near a peak time the order would be slower to be filled, totally worth the wait! The quality in the embroidery on the hat was AMAZING! Will definitely order some merchandise from them again<//review>

I've purchased multiple different shirts from this company and each time I am impressed beyond words! Great clothing line! Excellent customer service! I even asked them a while back if I could get their logo as a tattoo and they said HELLS YEAH! Not many companies have a personal touch like this one! Whenever I wear a shirt from them I get asked where I got it from!</Review>

Sickest products I’ve ever owned. Quality!!! 💯 Always a good time when I’m in my Born Scum gear. Great conversation starter. If you haven’t supported this mom & pop company yet, you should! Knowing everything is tested and true to the owners approval along with the fact that everything is done in house by the owners makes me so pumped on their merch. Keep up the good work, I’ll keep ordering!< /Text>

<text>This is a great 2 people owned/operated company. Everything made in house by the owners and great quality products that’ll last you. As for customer service, I cracked a joke online once about how long an order was taking and got a phone call 15-20 minutes after I posted it. The gal (I’m horrible with names but she’s one of the owners) was super cool and informative about how they do everything in-house, by hand in “shifts” per each design or product... and then threw some extras in the package on top of it. So, it’s a company I have now ordered from 3-4 times and will continue to since I like all their shirt designs and other products. All in all a great small business that delivers better products/quality than any big company I’ve dealt with.

<Review>I love the quality and customer service of this company! They always go out of their way to make sure my orders get to me as fast as possible. They work around the clock with only two of them to put out this amazing product! Aaaand they go as far as they can to keep it 100% American made! They also love fat people so they have big shirts too! ( I’m a fat kid size)< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I found this company because my uncle sent me a shirt and some stickers for my birthday years ago. It was the hipster murder crew shirt and I loved it so much I went back and ordered a couple more t-shirt’s for me and some for my friends. They shipped on time and the quality of the clothing is great. I will always be a customer of theirs.</text>

Born Scum Clothing Co. is a small company run by a husband and wife team so it does take 1-4 weeks to fill some of the orders but they’ve got the sickest clothing designs out there and the customer service is excellent!! If you have a question they respond immediately! No talking to machines no waiting days for a response!! I would give them 6 stars out of 5 based on the customer service alone.<//review>

I was in the market to replace the seat on 2016 Street Bob, was looking at going a Saddleman seat when I came across the Born Scum branded seat. I really dug it and it was just what I was looking for! Besides being a great looking seat, it is one of the most comfy seats I have ever sat on!

I am looking forward to getter The born scum derby cover to match the seat and tie in the rest of the bike!

They have awesome shirts, and hats too!!< /text>

@echochoir, So it's been 3 years that I made my first order to this dude, super cool people, I've emailed a few times with questions regarding orders, always hit back usually same business day. I made first 2 orders when they were slinging ink in their garage, now they moved up and ZERO has changed with Tee material and quality, the life span of ink with modern driers high heat still stands up, and customer service is top notch. Will continue to place orders and promote the brand, never taken a kickback for my reviews and never will. Own 9 Tees and I've gifted several others that has turned my fam/friends into customers. Thanks and keep up ya'll's great work.</text>

I ordered a couple of shirts from these "professional" business owners on Jan 11. After asking a week after ordering when they were going to ship my shirts that were listed as in stock, they referred me to their FAQs that states they fulfill orders in 1-4 weeks. I asked again why it would take that long to ship seeing as they were IN STOCK and they made an excuse stating that they were a 2 person operation. They also refused to answer me as to whether or not the shirts were actually in stock as stated on their website. Almost 4 weeks later I just happen to check on my EXTREMELY SLOW order and see that they cancelled it 2 days ago, WITHOUT EVEN NOTIFYING ME, and check this out - they listed me, the customer, as the reason for the cancellation, even though our last communication was from me asking them to send them as soon as possible. Way to live up to your namesake, born scum.

Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time or money on a couple of people that apparently only pretend they run a reputable company. There are plenty of other companies who strive to please their customers, will act with professionalism, and will provide a long lasting product.< /Text>

Shipping is really long though.

<Text>Got 3 shirts almost year ago. I dry my shirts with little concern for the prints and all of my Born Scum shirts have held up well. Also A+ on customer service. I ordered one of the shirts in the wrong size. Reached out to them via Facebook messager and they helped in a timely matter.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>I ordered 2 shirts for a Father's day gift from my 3 daughters to their dad a week and a half ahead of time, I didn't get my package for 6 weeks... Horrible service, I emailed after 2 weeks for updates and they then sent me their FAQ stating it takes 1-4 weeks, ok but 6 weeks later!!! I emailed them at 5 weeks and they said my package was going out the next day.... yea, it went out after 3 more days.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1602129429824, 'text': 'It was great talking to you Melissa.

This spot is the one I always prefer. I visit plenty of restaurants but to this one I go the most. The crew is very affectionate and the cuisine they offer is so appetizing. I never decline to have a good dinner here. I highly recommend this place.<//review>

two days ago was our first time in this excellent restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the attentive service, with the magnificent  cuisine and wine and with the honest payment. We will absolutely visit there soon.</Review>

First time for me to eat there! There were no other customers when we were there. The taste are pretty unique, in my opinion it's better than the 'Boiling Crab' taste. Customer service was great, prices are moderate to high.</review>

I emailed the manager and he told me to bring back the old food like its my fault that I got some bad service plus they can't even take back food due to covid so I threw it away.

I like this spot! They prepare sensational food, their menu is decent, The cook in that spot is a specialist, I like very much eating all their food. The food is always good, the service towards the guests  is agreeable. I  go often to this place and I was never unsatisfied. I recommend this place.<//Review>

The Food was gross and mushy and we only got 2 pieces of corn and 5 pieces of sausage. Not coming here again. Definitely recommend going to boiling crab instead of this place it's a little pricey but it's way better quality.</Text>

I'm unemployed and was on a budget so i just ordered the appetizer garlic noodles and 8 shrimp.

The shrimp was dry and i only got 7. The noodles were over cooked and i could pick up the stack of noodles by 1 noodle alone.

The say they are sauteed in butter. I don't think so.

I paid $20 for this dry mess with a drink in which i really needed to get it down my throat.

Will never return.

The shrimp was dry and i only got 7. The noodles were over cooked and i could pick up the stack of noodles by 1 noodle alone.

The say they are sauteed in butter. I don't think so.

I paid $20 for this dry mess with a drink in which i really needed to get it down my throat.

Will never return.

<Text>We dined last night (7/30/18) with my family for my birthday. We were seated but I requested to be moved at another table. This girl server ( didn’t get her name but she’s the only girl server that night) was very annoyed of my request which can’t be denied by her facial expression and body language. Actions speak louder than words as we all know. She moved us yes, but absolutely made me feel that my request was unacceptable because she already laid the paper on the table. Maybe you need to train her how to be a welcoming host, at least learn how to smile, cause with that quality of service, I’m not even thinking of coming back no matter how much I love the food. You don’t want this kind of attitude on your team. 😡 Service quality is one important reason for your business will really Kickin succeed. I won’t blame you if you decide not to post. 😡😡😡< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This place lived up to the hype. A little over an hour wait on a Friday night but they have a bench and a nice heater outside and bring out tiny cups of clam chowder. Customer service is amazing, cool ambiance in Rowland Heights.< /Text>

Customer service was great. Girls come and ask how your doing. Everyone was very attentive. I have visited many cajun placed but this one is by far the best. The flavors are sooo good and corn was very yummy. My #1 cajun place<//Review>

Five stars because no long wait, price is reasonable, seasoning is good. Unlike other "famous" Cajun place bwlng crb always over hype and the seasoning very thin aka watery. But this place is very decent.  Wouldve been better if glove provided<//text>

<review>Good place to have seafood boils, the place is very open and will have to wait a while to get a table. Servers won't come back to your table after they have brought your food. They offer free refills but they won't came back to ask for a refill unless you waive them down.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>I really enjoyed eating at The Kickin' crab! Eating spicy cajun shrimp, clams, and sausage by the pound is always a good time.

The clams are especially good here, but I definitely recommend eating the shrimp, sausage, clams, and corn combo for the full Kickin' Crab experience. Bring some friends though, because it is a lot of food!

As for service, my experience was very good, staff is attentive and polite.

There was no wait to be seated, we were able to walk right in.

All in all, I really enjoyed the experience of eating here!</text>< user_id>

Taste similar to boiling crab. Waitresses are super nice and pretty. They have crayfish, which boiling crab doesn't. Went there Tuesday night around 8PM, not many people, so the service was fast. We spend 90 dollars, and all three of us were stuffed.</Text>

The place is tucked away in a corn3r right off the freeway. My coworker, her bf and I got there with in 10 mins of each other. Parking was a breeze since it was only 5:45 pm. When I walked in last, the place was dead with 2 tables of 20 full?!! Makes me wonder why?
Service was blahh.. the guy server was ok, could of been better and asked us for the side condiments we wanted.. rather than us remember you need to ask for lemons/limes and salt pepper mix.
Once we placed an order option 3 - mild kickin, it took the usual time to come out. Like 10 maybe even 15 mins? The bad part.. our garlic noodles.. they weren't piping hit and definitely weren't fresh. I had ate at the Costa Mesa location 3 days prior... their food rocks.
Over all. I give them a 3 star. Seafood was really good, service and garlic noodles on a really slow day? Sucked</text>

The most pleasant experience. It surpassed my expectations. I only came in for an eye exam without any knowledge of the place. Came in and was told to wait for the doctor. I waited outside for about 10-15min. since there is no seating area inside. Dr. Wang was great and would recommend him in a heartbeat. It was such a personable experience. I want to thank the receptionist and the Doctor.<//review>

My favorite Dr to visit. So warm and does a very through eye exam. Always gives me a prescription for contacts and glasses in one exam and has a fabulous selection of frames.<//Text>

Been going to Designer Eyes for 3 years now. Great service overall. I am going back today for some new frames and lenses. Great prices and they work with you and your insurance to make sure we are accommodated. Definitely recommend.<//Review>

<text>Excellent experience!
I only made the glasses there. The prices were excellent compared with multiple places I visited. The glass came with a problem, the glass was loose, they fixed, so I only have complements to give.
No doubt it would be my first option for making my next glass and next time even make the eye exam there so I can give more complete review.<//text><userid>115636313791900481458< /userid>< Pictures>

<Date>1553179115027< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I couldn't recommend this place enough. Their selection of frames is wonderful and the staff is an absolute delight.

They are not in my vision insurance network, but worked with me so I could purchase glasses from them, frames and lenses. I am beyond happy I found them, and I visited a number of places.

I was also impressed they had my frames PERFECTLY adjusted when I came to pick them up. Even though places, including this one, measure me beforehand, it still takes awhile to adjust when ready. Not the case here. First time ever I've had this.

If you need an eye check and/ or glasses, you will be very pleased if you make this place your choice as well. I will definitely return.<//review>< pictures>

I highly recommend Designer Eyes Optometry to anyone looking for new glasses and/or a rx for your glasses. I called and they were able to schedule me for a same-day appointment! I received a very thorough examination by the Dr. Everything was carefully explained to me and I felt like they really cared about the health of my eyes. They have a HUGE selection of glasses. I went with transitional lenses and I got a great deal and am very satisfied with the glasses. I HIGHLY recommend Designer Eyes Optometry for all your Optometry needs. You won't be disappointed.<//text>

Let me just start by saying that the service was absolutely amazing. The Oakley sports glasses definitely saved me in completing my half marathon as I wished. Without those, I would not have been able to cross the finish line. I hadn't realized that my vision was so terrible until I found Dr. Wang. He carries many brands and models that are unique to his store and fashionable as well. I am 100% going to come back in the future. Thanks so much Dr. Wang for all that you do to help me accomplish my dreams! I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Wang as your optometrist.<//review>

I couldn't have been more satisfied.  First of all, the location was exceptionally convenient. I have VSP and selected Designer Eyes Optometry based upon the location. Dr. Michael Wang is great and really nice, he was professional, informative and attentive to my questions, provided a quick and thorough exam. The store was clean, tidy and organized. The staff was welcoming and pleasant. Amazing service! A great experience!< /Text>

Workers just to worried about talking to each other instead of getting orders out and also cashier was on her personal phone on speaker like no big deal!

First, I want to say thank you for being open and providing a shield at the counter. Second I want to say thank you for having your staff wear masks especially because you make food. Unfortunately, wearing a mask under the nose doesn't count. You are still breathing on clients food. Your staff at the front counter wasn't wearing her mask appropriately but thankfully the cook and the other woman was. I hope this doesn't continue to happen you can spread the virus through everything. Food included. #science #biology<//text>

3 stars because typically we do pretty well when we come here for dinner.

Tonight, I stopped by around 8:00 P.M. and got a Waba Bowl for my girlfriend.
Side note: she has an eating disorder so I have to beg her to eat and I want it to be filling.

I got home and hand it to her only to see the steak was purple....raw steak. The chicken was still pink inside. And to top it off, it was cold after a quick 6 minute trip home.
She doesn't eat carbs, so since I place the order with no rice, the meat is a big part of this dish. I was not very happy. $12 wasted, a still hungry girlfriend, and potential food poisoning and deff salmonella avoided.

Never had problems at this location in the year ive been coming to this particular location.

To whomever reads this, its not a bad location, but I would be sure to check your meat before walking out.< /Review>

Nov. 5, 2pm. Customer service needs work...  Ordered a steak plate with avacado to go. I always check to make sure the avacado was added because half the time I get charged $1.89 and its not there. So I open my food lid inside the togo bag and notice theres no avacado. I told the girl behind the counter, didnt even look up at me, just turned around grabbed some avacado in a  bowl and blindly placed it on the counter with her back turned to me. Then I asked for more sauce, she tossed it in my bag rudely while I try closing the container lid, the sauce packets landed all in my food. Then she walked away. No apology. Just left me mad enough to actually write a review about it . Coulldnt see her badge with her name on it. Food was good though.< /Text>

<Text>Lovely experience! Came in and was instantly greeted by Julianna, the cashier. She helped me sort out the best menu options/prices,  they have a value-menu meal! Mini bowl, drink & a side for 7.99! Great deal. After the order was patiently and politely taken, I noticed the area, all tables were spotless (some closed to promote social distancing). The floors were a little dirty, but that’s just my OCD. I asked if I could dine-in and the cashier’s response was “Yes! Of course!” a bonus. The cook, cooked my food very well, hilarious watching him in his zone, listening to good, old school tunes, that I too enjoyed. As for my order, it was passed out by Levell. He was very kind and let me know he threw in some extra sauces in my bag for me. These employees are what make customers come back! I came in happy, I leave happier! Thank you Julianna, Levell and the cool (I didn’t get his name) for my great first time!<//Text>< rate>

<Review>The last few times we have purchased food from here, we've gotten burnt food. We also noticed the employees were not wearing masks or gloves while handling food. I'm not surprised someone got food poisoning from their food not too long ago. We probably won't be getting food from this Waba in particular since they consistently give us burnt food and most likely haven't cleaned their grill.

Also never received an email or any kind of help from Waba. They don't care and do not help customers in any way. We went back again and our food was burnt.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I had a horrible experience here. horrible customer service by Skylar and his staff. No one was at the counter when I walked in. The place was filthy, the tables had sauce stains from hours and hours ago. It took almost 5 minutes for me to even be acknowledged. After being acknowledged I was told there would be a 5 minute wait for white rice since the "cooker" broke! I waited almost 30 mins just to be asked if I wanted a refund or brown rice. 3 teenagers working here and they have no idea what food service is about. There were at least 4 other upset customers. Good luck. Never going back again STAY AWAY from this filthy place.< /text>

Had a beef plate and wished I hadn't... It was 94% rice 3% beef if that, 2% lettuce 1% sliver of orange.... Talk about feeling  unsatisfied..
Staff was good. Just NO meat and no veggies in the plate...  I would think twice about going there again...The value is not there.....</Review>

My first time to the WaBa, it was very good the young men were very polite and it was clean. Overall great experience, but I have to say it was not much different then Flame Broiler which I also love.< /text>

Salmon bowl is so good. It has a delicate flavor to it and with veggies and brown rice you feel like you're really behaving diet wise.< /Text>

<review>8:25 I walked in and it smells like cleaning products ..mopping the floors with bleach  during business hours....I ask if there open ..the guy taking orders is mopping..he grabs the bowl filled it with rice and vegetables and slides it to the cook. The cook is washing dishes and cleaning the back. The cutting board is as bad as it can get same with the chopping knife. They dont wash there hands and the cook telling the front guy he is not serving all the people who just walked in behind me..now about 8:30..the cook only put on gloves after he seen me watching closely. I been coming to this place for two years and it's always questionable. I don't trust the workers or the food.<//review><date>1559927196111< /date></record></dataset><record>

We had a coupon that the assist manager didn't want to honor. He called the owner for permission. Eventually, after a lengthy debate they decided to take it. What is the point of having this dude in a manager position if he can't make decisions on his own? The food is always tasty from here. Overall, I like this establishment. It's clean and the food is consistently delicious.<//Review>

Not one of my favorites for different reasons. I dont enjoy the way service is set up. It is fast but impersonal; as  passing cows to the slaughter machine or trying to get u out of the way quickly. I dont enjoy the taste of food; I cant categorize it, it's like undetermined.<//review>

let me start from the beginning I woke up and hit the gym like I usually do (chest day today) I was quite hungry after taking those 100s for a ride on the incline and being that I wanna eat clean and fuel up properly I decided to feed at this waba grill (I've been to many others but this one took the cake or should I say my heart ❤️) I ordered the chicken bowl and brown rice hold the sauce and let me tell you that chicken was outstanding and tasted so fresh that I thought they had their own little farm in the back! And same with the rice! Quality ingredients without a doubt and served very quickly, called me for my order before I even got a chance to sit down! the best part the owner is on sight! he's in there working with the employees like a real leader (unlike donald trump) Great establishment, great environment to eat. Would recommend to anyone!<//text>

I just love Waba Grill and the manager at the store in Lake Elsinore in the shopping center with Vons & Walmart. Brady the manager (who worked his butt off to get that promotion), which I believe he deserved.  Brady says hello as soon as you walk in the door. Everyone who works there does their job. Above and beyond what they probably are required to do. I usually go into Waba Grill at least once a week and everytime it's been a pleasant experience. Good job to the employees and to Brady. You make me feel special Everytime I enter your restaurant. Thanks alot
If I could give you 10 stars I would!!👍👌<//Review>

<text>I appreciate the fact that when a mistake was made, Sean was quick to remedy it and offered a replacement meal. Starting a business can be tough especially finding reliable and quality staff. I hope the location does well and Sean and his business succeed in Lake Elsinore.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Everything is good: fresh products, nice customer service, good ambiance, but the Salmon was just toooo overcooked. It was actually burnt, so maybe they should pay attention to this even during rush hours.</text>

(Translated by Google) I love this place. One of my favorites in the world. The salad and soup buffet is delicious. Fresh and crispy vegetables and delicious mushroom soup. It also has pizza and fruit waters.
The service is great. The only negative about Waba is that it is not everywhere.

Amo este lugar. Uno de mis favoritos en el mundo. El buffet de ensaladas y sopas es delicioso. Los vegetales frescos y crujientes y la sopa de champiñones riquísima. También tiene pizza y aguas de frutas.
El servicio es genial. Lo único negativo de Waba es que no está en todas partes.< /text>

Just got their pork burrito. Taste is amazing. I like big chunks of pork meat. Also they give you some corn chips with spicy sauce. Price is fair. Highly recommended</Text>

<response>None< /response><Review>I have loved this place for so long but lately they have been lacking.. I’m not sure why but lately every time I order there’s always something missing ( example got the enchiladas and they forgot the sour cream , or got the chilaquiles and they only put one egg instead of 2) or they get the order wrong. Also the amount of food they are giving is little compared to before. The food still tastes amazing and there’s good service but it’s a bummer that there’s always something off when we order from there lately.<//Review><username>Kary Quezada<//username><GmapID>0x80c2996033d185b3:0x6fabad547a3f20b4</GmapID><rate>3<//rate><user>116085820872893127082</user>< Date>

Need work with cultural differences especially  being in an English speaking country. But, its also a great Mexican American restaurant, so what do you expect. Minor improvements needed such as a new POS system and better communication with Delivery Companies like Postmates. One downside though us the chips I had were stale. But, hey as former Marine, I know what it means to appreciative something, while being deprived of it.</text>

If I could give this place more than a 5 star I would. I have been ordering through Grubhub and decided to finally come in person. The food is smacking good! Food taste just like home. Everything I ate felt as if my mom was behind the kitchen. I would recommend this place to everyone. It's very affordable and the ladies who own it are sweet, on top of their service for you, and hard working.

Home made cooking for sure !</review>

Food is delicious.   Tried their menudo and is the best I have had in a long time.  I was afraid it would be too greasy, but to my surprise it was not! Best menudo ever! I love their handmade tortillas.  Will be back to try the pozole. Oh, I forgot to mention the champurrado is sooo good!< /Text>

<Review>My hubby and I were put off by the inside of the restaurant... it was very dirty even though we saw the grade A in the door... we joked that they had paid someone off for that ;). We decided to stay anyways because we read good reviews... we did like the food. I asked for green sauce to have with my chips because everyone raved about that but we thought it was bland... might have been just a bad day. I ordered cheese enchiladas which were good and my hubby ordered a carne asada burrito that was average.<//Review>< Time>

<text>The Lodge leadership stopped caring about guests. There are a handful of members that are “regulars” at the RV site and they were recently told they could only stay two weeks at a time and then leave for two weeks. This new rule supposedly applies to everyone however they are allowing at least one elderly woman to stay permanently because her and her husband “gave a lot of money” to the lodge over the years. So I guess their money secured them a spot but others who pay monthly are being forced to find other locations to stay. It’s not fair. There are other elderly people and families that count on this lodge for a spot and have for a long time. The individuals and families that are being forced to leave have followed the rules and always understood that incoming groups take priority over them. This decision by the leadership is unsatisfactory and extremely disappointing. The camp hosts are great though. They’ve done an amazing job accommodating the guests. I wish the lodge leadership could do the same.

If the leadership decides to treat ALL guests equally and not show favoritism to those with the largest pocketbooks then I will remove this post. I’m a Marine Corps leader and would never accept this type of leadership in my organization.  I hope this place gets its act together so the good people providing that steady stream of income to the lodge can stay and not displace their family.</text>< Pictures>

Joe, the camp host went above and beyond to make space for us.  Our first time staying at any Elks lodge park and everyone was so friendly.  The lodge food was excellent and all the women working the bar and restaurant were outstanding.  Wish we could have stayed longer.  We will be back again for sure!</text>

The Lodge itself and the ammenities are good... However If you enjoy getting cold looks and 0 hellos from your Trumpy neighbors, this is the place! Just my opinion.< /text>

And at no time were you told to stay as long as you would like.\n\nWhen it was explained to you that the lodge was closing you didn't leave. We have set hours and are mainly staffed by volunteers, so therefore I will not apologize for closing the lodge at closing time.\n\nHowever please feel free to come I my office and discussed this with me any time you would like.\n\nThank you and have a great day.\n\nFraternally,\n\nJames L."}< /response>

My dad is a long time member and my God mother was the former Exulted Ruler of the Vista Elks Lodge.  I came in from Florida to celebrate my Birthday with my family.   Most of the people we met very nice.  My father had a bit too much to drink and was having trouble getting around.   We pulled the car around to get him in it safely but we had to get my 30 year old sons to help.  I had to prop the door open temporarily to get everybody in position to help him.  2 ladies come up tried to close the door.  I tried to explain what we were doing and they told us to go through my dad's belongings to get his card and they were ladies that needed that door shut.  I tell them that I'm a lady too and we are just trying to help my dad and we mean no harm.  We were trying to do this as fast as we could.  It was 7pm at night so the Elks was still open. Then they tried changing their story about the bar being closed and we shouldn't be there.  We were shooting pool and was told by numerous staff members we could stay as long as we wanted. I do not know who these 2 ladies were but they really gave the Elks Lodge a bad name.</text>

Vista Elks is a very nice Lodge to visit while in the RV and not too far from Castle Creek Golf Course.  Our Chula Vista Elks Vagabonds RV Club really enjoys our trips to the Lodge.  Members are very friendly and good food with bands on Friday nights. Other restaurants are just a short walk down the driveway.<//review>

Worst apartment complex ever. Terrible management. I do not recommend anyone looking for an apartment to even waste their time attempting check the place out. You WON’T get your deposit back and they will add miscellaneous fees when you move out. I regret moving here. So please, learn from my mistake and avoid this place!</Review>

Unfortunately, pets cause a lot of damage to carpet, padding and the sub floor and those damages are billed to the resident after move out. I already had an opportunity to discuss things with your household and I was able to help to the best of my ability with some of the damage costs. Again, I'm sorry that you felt your residency here was so bad. Please contact me at the office directly if you have anything else you'd like to discuss.\n\nI hope that you enjoy your new home!\n\nSamantha McBride\nCommunity Director\nAshford Park"}< /response>< gmapID>

I was 12 days shy of hitting the 11 year mark for living in Ashford Park! I enjoyed my stay there. Anytime I needed something fixed/repaired they were right on it. I had no issues or complaints. I would still be living there if we hadn't purchased our own home. I was sad to leave but excited for my new adventures. I'll definitely miss the community! The office staff was very friendly. Thanks for making my stay there so pleasant. I'll definitely refer family/friends to rent from you.<//review>

< Review>
I recently moved out of Ashford Park due to a family situation in Southern California. But, if I didn’t have to leave, I wouldn’t have. I lived in the complex for several years. It’s a beautiful place with lots of trees in a good area, reminds me of Tahoe or something in the mountains. It’s definitely older and could use some upgrades, but I think that’s in process.
There were many staff changes, but I think they finally Almost found a good team. Sam and Carly  in the office were always friendly and professional to me every time I had to contact the office for something. The current manager Sam took over for the property sometime last summer and there has been a lot of good changes. She definitely sticks to the rules of the lease but seems to enforce things fairly and the complex was really showing improvement and getting quieter and cleaned for the most part. She has made some exterior upgrades and some much needed improvements already. The manager before was Jamie and she was really sweet but was probably too nice and let a lot of things get out of control. I was in the office one time and a very rude young neighbor of mine came in yelling and cursing because she had gotten a notice about an unpaid balance I think. Sam will not tolerate that kind of behavior for sure. She calmed her down quickly and I was really impressed by that because I couldn’t have someone yelling and cussing at me like that! She was very professional but doesnt allow nonsense. Sam and Carly will always try to help you and are understanding.
When I left there was a guy working in the office I don’t remember his name but he was really rude and seemed to not like people in general. I wouldn’t even bother talking to him. But if you stick to Interacting with the ladies you’ll be ok. Carly is probably the nicest and most genuine person, she listens when you have a problem and really gets things taken care of.
As far as maintenance, there’s a new guy Jim that Started right before I moved out. He really seemed like he wanted to get things taken care of for you and was friendly and easy to talk to. I would see him on my walks in the morning and he was always busy but had a smile on his face. The guy before never spoke to anyone and I honestly don’t know what he did besides ride around in his golf cart.
I read a couple reviews of people complaining about their deposit refunds. Which is really what made me feel the need to leave this review. I had no problem, besides cleaning and some blinds my cat damaged, I was able to get my refund. If you’ve ever rented an apartment in your life, you know they have to get the unit professionally cleaned. Period! Even if you clean, they will still have to get it cleaned professionally. That’s for EVERY SINGLE APARTMENT COMPLEX. Maybe because this isn’t my first time renting, but you should learn to expect deductions for paint, cleaning and any other damage. Be realistic and take responsibility for how you left the apartment.
Overall I loved Ashford, and I would recommend anyone to live there. I had no major issues during my time there, never had any pest issues at all, besides the squirrels and turkeys outside lol If I had to say anything negative it would be that the interiors of the apartments are older and could use some modernization. My cabinets in the kitchen seemed to be original from the 70s or something. I hated them but made do with shelving paper. The appliances were older too but worked fine. I would hope they are upgrading the interiors soon.
This is a nice modest complex that is perfect for small families or anyone looking for value in the pocket area. I would highly recommend living there and I wish I didn’t have to leave.< /Review>

<Review>The staff is terrible. We stopped by on a Saturday to see what was available.  We waited outside as asked while another person was shown a unit. When it was our turn we were given a floor plan sheet and a price sheet and rushed out so she could help the people who came in after us. We decided to apply before seeing the unit because there was only one left of that model and we didn't want to loose out. We payed the high app fee of $49.12 per person. plus a holding deposit. We were denied 24 hours later and now we have to wait for our money to be returned until they process it. My options to get it back are drive 30 minutes away or wait for it to be mailed. Skip applying here and go down the street to the Broadleaf apartments they are much more friendly to everyone.

It has been 72 hours since we applied and 48 hours since we were denied and we have not received our holding deposit back nor have we been notified it was mailed or that we could pick it up. The management company for this complex has horrible reviews as well. FPI Management in Folsom, CA look them up and stay far far away from the Thieves here< /Review></record>

This is not a good place to live.

From having a stairway collapse under me, random gate malfunctions and a lack of attention to detail when it comes to billing, I would never do business with this management company again.< /review>

The place is ok to live but I had the same experience as Kay M. Despite cleaning the entire apartment, they said that they would charge me for a cleaning service. It seems like it is a consistent tactic to try and nickle-and-dime you for your security deposit. If you have no other choice, the place is fairly safe and the apartments are fine. Just make sure to calculate the cost of your deposit into your expected payments, because you are not getting it back.< /Review>

I do not write reviews but I just wanted to share my experience. If you decide to rent here, you WILL NOT get your deposit back. & don't even bother to clean, just leave it as is because even if you do clean, they will still charge you $100+ for cleaning.  Don't even waste your time cleaning the carpet too, got charged $100+ for that as well. In one of the older reviews, by the name Mohsin Abbas, the same exact thing happened to me! I got charged for painting and carpet as well. Its ridiculous! Rent elsewhere!!!< /text>

Amazing property. The trees throughout the complex give you that feeling of being in a wonderous Forrest. The complex is ran by one of the kindest people I've ever met. If you want to live at a property who sticks by their word and gets done what needs to get done Ashford Park is the complex for you. Jamie Soltau is the employee who recommended me to this property and funny enough is now the complex manager.< /review>

<text>It's interesting how they put conditions on how you need to comply with putting deposits up front and fees for applicants, but if things don't work out because they changed the conditions after they gave me a written move in contract with deposit amount and rent as well as prorated charges, they take forever to return YOUR money, which by the way you need for your other applications. I have called countless times, everytime they say it's on its way  but nothing...I even called the corporate offices to complain and nothing son far, it's been almost a month. Where is my money?????
On Monday I received a call from management stating they just sent my check on Friday last week, we'll it is Friday again and I have not received the check, are you guys trying to make me forget about it or what?. Why do you keep lying and giving me the run around?.<//text>< Pictures>

I am very disappointed with Ashford. I had the same exact experience as Kay described. I had a pre-inspection done and was told nothing was wrong. After spending an entire day cleaning my apartment I was still charged a cleaning fee of $115. If you plan on moving out of Ashford don't even waste your time cleaning, you'll still be charged a cleaning fee. I was also charged for repainting all walls despite the fact that there was no wall damage/marks. If you consider moving into Ashford know you will nicked and dimed for everything when you move out. I can say plenty more but I'll just keep it at this.< /text>

This is probably the most honest review you'll read about this place. Here is the thing about a lot of the apartment complex communities in Sacramento that you should know - many are ran by FPI Management Company. It took me half a year to write this review because 1: I didn't want to write a review while I was emotional and 2: I wanted to do some independent research on the place and the management company that oversee's the directors, managers and assistant managers. I was actually going to let it slide but I saw one of FPI's staff members at a restaurant and it inspired to give whoever is reading this a genuine and honest review.
The community itself isn't bad. It could use some upgrades, but I believe they were in the process of upgrading when I left. The pool area's are decent and the grounds are regularly maintained by a gardening service. Because it's one of the community's with a lower price point, it has a tenancy to attract a crowd that some wouldn't want as neighbors, but even with that being said, my time there truly wasn't terrible.  It was when it was time to leave that things got weird. I kept my place clean; very clean. I even took video and pictures when I left of how my carpet was spot/stain-free. If you're a regular renter, you know that this is an absolute must. I expected to get my deposit back in full and didn't, originally - I had to fight for it. I had enough proof that couldn't really be fought, so in the end I got the majority of my deposit back.
Jamie and Marvin are the two main people I corresponded with during this time. I'm reading some of the other reviews and, I have to disagree with what others are saying. I never had a 'bad' experience with the staff at Ashford Park. They were always nice and when I had an issue, they fixed it. The deposit took a little longer that it should have (a lot of going back and forth), but for the most part, it was fine. I think one thing to remember is that YOU as a renter need to get into the habit of always covering you bases.
The problem is FPI Management, and now that I know some of the people at corporate it's so clear why these apartment communities get such terrible reviews. FPI treats their employees terribly and pay them close to nothing. The budget some of the communities need to stay within is ludicrous when you see all that needs to be done. FPI is also one of the most poorly rated places to work. Bad management starts at the top, and the bar that corporate sets for their employees while giving them zero reward/acknowledgement is reflected in many of these apartment communities. Thankfully, Jamie and Marvin have always conducted themselves as professionals and have been responsive to my needs as a tenant. Just know that sometimes, they have to make a decision that they don't always agree with - it is out of their control.
Good luck!<//Text>

I rented an appartment within this gated community. I sincerley recommend my friends, not to deal with this community ever if you visit Sacramento.
This community didn't return my security deposit claiming that we created a lot of mess in our appartment.. I was living with my siblings and and all of us were mature enough to take care of our appartment.
None of us was smoker .We nor had any furniture.
They charged us for carpet cleaning and painting in appartment although we left the appartment as good as we got at the time of moving in. We were moving far away from Sacramento and they took an undue advantage of that fact. In fact I paid one month's rent extra as I was leaving the appartment before the ending of my lease period.< /Text>

My boyfriend and I have lived here as our first place together for every a year and half now. This place is the WORST as far as management, maintenance and security.

The "gated community" is hardly EVER gated because the gate doesn't even close like it's supposed to.. Maintenance has to be reminded several times to fix things. If you don't remind them at least twice, they never come. Management is terrible with handling customers and make errors with rent fees TOO OFTEN! They were trying to charge us an additional $100 for month to month when we signed a 6 month lease.. The manager said she would fix it and advised me to disregard it. However the following month came in with the same $100 additional charge. When I called them, they told me to "disregard" it again..

They never apologize for their own mistakes. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO A SINGLE SOUL. This has been by far, the worst living experience ever. Ir regret ever giving this place a damn DIME!<//text>< gmapID>

<text>This place has some of the least knowledgeable doctors on hand. Went into urgent care with severe back pain after I blew my back lifting weights. So bad I had to be wheelchaired in. Saw a “doctor” who literally touched my back and said it’s just strained. Gave me pain medication and a shot for pain and sent me home. In the long run, after Physical therapy and FINALLY getting an MRI from the VA, found out I have a bulged disc and mild arthritis. I’ve been living with this pain for months now and sadly probably worsened because the staff they have, to me, are not medical professionals and will do the least amount to help the VA financially. All other medical professionals I spoke to, either I personally know or outside of the VA, asked why they did not do an MRI earlier. I informed them that the staff I spoke with at my appointments, said it’s not needed at that time, because I’m not in agonizing pain. I see why everyone, veterans and civilians, lack respect for the VA medical system.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808565bb7ea32499:0xf6ea1b1d9f4ccfbf< /Gmap_id></record>

After I received the "T.&P." rating my wife of 40 year's became eligible for " ChampVA". She's a two time cancer survivor with thyroid issues. Our prayers are answed. NOT !!!!
She is not well right now ! Went to my VA clinic (Mtz) for her enrollment and Urgent Care.
After 2 Hours ! VA does not take VA !!??!!
Same logos, forms etc..... "ChampVA"  tells you if use VA? No co-pays! (They refused to see my wife ! Dispite the fact she is very sick !) Then dawned on me* Friday before 3 day weekend......
Now can't find anyone who takes "ChampVA".... Now what ?? Take her to Travis AFB ? Nope.

<Review>The appointment line customer service rep was so rude, I was still talking and he hung up on me! He keeps yawning on the phone and he put me on hold without telling me so I thought at first the line cut off, so I checked my phone and the call was still active, so I waited.

Been with Martinez Va for 10 years now and we have a great team of Doctors. Our life in the beginning was overwhelming with appointments but it was necessary. We are now in a better place in Life, marriage and I can't thank our team at the Va enough...<//Review>

The VA in Martinez was not Always Great [back in the 70s - 80s & early 90s] when it was a Hospital.....
they had some major issues.

As you might have figured - I've been using the VA for some time!   Much of how this Outpatient Clinic operates along with the Doctors & Staff performance relates with the expectations of Senior Management Team & Director of the Northern California Health Care System... in addition to the budget they are given to operate.  We [the  Veterans] are extremely fortunate as the past two Directors & the  current Director is excellent! He demands a lot from everyone - treating all Veterans as Customers & providing the best service possible and the highest quality health care to all those who served our country.
My personal experiences are excellent!  Have outstanding Doctors and received excellent care through the VA in Martinez.  When I required surgery on my heart - I was provided options although chose to be sent to VA San Francisco "Ft. Miley" & obtained the best care from a team of the amazing doctors & educators.

Now - I cannot say enough positive good things about the VA in Northern California.  I know the VA has problems  in many other parts of the country & they are working on correcting those issues.

In the greater SF bay area we are fortunate to have one of the best!  Work with them - talk with your care providers.  Be specific - write down your issue so you remember the details you want to mention.
The do not care or have anything to do with your service connected claim- or your disability rating!

VA  doctors are there to treat your health.  They do not work on your disability claim or rating.  Go see the County Veteran Service Officer in Martinez to get help with that issue.  There office is just across the street.<//text>

Place sucks!  Gave it one star because I couldn’t post unless I mark at least one.  Been to several VA’s in different states and this place takes the cake.  Never been seen within two hours.  So many workers but they just walk around while you wait forever.  I have never seen anyone ask the patient about their situation and how they can help.  Pure sickening because we veterans deserve better for the sacrifices we made for this country.<//text>

I don't know what that guy is talking about. You cannot get care unless you have a VA card. I have been going there since 2006 and find it a great VA Clinic. The staff is always helpful and polite unless you come in with a chip on your shoulder. I have had great care in audiology, ophthalmology, general medicine, emergency room, dermatology, pharmacy and wound care.

The anonymous poster from 5 years ago is stating wrong and misleading information.< /Review>

Always get great, thorough and timely service. I feel that the staff really cares about us veterans.
Shout-out to Nurse Jonah for her consciousness and Dr. Alba is always pleasant and patient. Of all the healthcare plans I've had in my life (Kaiser, Blue Cross,Pacificare, etc)this is the best!<//Text>

<Text>If you make a complaint they will dig up everything they can on you to try to turn it against you.  Even if the person that is working there really shouldn't be I.E. the doctor has to go back and fourth with her nurses cause she doesn't know how to use her computer or you tell her you don't like a certain medication and they litterally say "I don't care."  I have a mental illness and I'm not easy to deal with but they turn hostile extremely quickly.  Also my therapist told me I shouldn't rely on a substance to feel better and that was for back when I smoked pot which is completely reasonable and since I've stopped.  But he told me I shouldn't rely on my medication either as a "substance".  Now I'm not someone that will randomly stop taking my medication but you tell the wrong type of person that kinda stuff they can have alot of problems.  If you have the ability I'd go some where else for your healthcare unless alot of people have been fired since the last time I was there.  You get the sense just walking in the door that your just a number.<//Text><Rating>1< /Rating>< user_id>

The inpatient facility is not fair to significant others. They expect you to care for the stroke patient (fetching various items, using urinal, blowing nose,, and feeding, etc). Basically doing the CNAs job. But you cannot spend the night or get a meal. And I feel that is NOT fair. Why should I be expected to do the job that they get paid alot of money for but .i cannot get even get a meal or lodging! No good facility</Text>

I rarely write a review.  My dad had been in VA Napa Unit for 9 months after his stroke.  I must say after reading reviews that people do experience things differently and yes there were some things we had to fight for, but you have to do that in almost every aspect of life.  The staff at Napa cared for my father.  He passed away a few days before Xmas.  We went to see him every week, as we did not live in the area.  I have to say the staff was amazing, he had to have everything done for him.  He was always clean, groomed, spoken to with kindness and humor (which he loved - he was a jokester).  THANK you for the love and attention you showed my father.</review>

Place is despicable! Staff constantly talk about helping you, but do nothing. OEF/OIF coordinator is a joke, and makes me wonder how they have that job. Because they turn people away who are in dire need of help. Had to wait over 5 months to be assigned, and to see a Doctor. Upon meeting him he tried to use his Navy credentials to get me to trust him, and rub the fact that he was retired in my face. Also 90% of their Social Workers are lazy, lethargic oafs who need to be fired, since they don't do their jobs. Went there after a heart attack... Had to wait 6 hours for a doctor to do a 20minute check up on me. Patient advocate goes around preaching that he can, and will fix every veteran's problem, but he doesn't. Very difficult to get ahold of to, however my Congressman's Office gave me his email, so I've got a nice paper trail started.<//Review>

Having not used VA medical until past 15 years , I would say it compares favorably with Kaiser where i had to fight to get things looked at. I found that it can take time ,but it does get done.<//Text>

The people that work here have little interest in helping people. I've been going here for 2 years now and every experience I've had has been negative. I've filed complaints and heard nothing back. I have had appointments made and cancelled for me without my permission or knowledge (This happens frequently). The staff here is very unprofessional, few exceptions of course.<//review>

Pretty extensive menu with vegetarian and vegan options that are fairly clearly marked on the menu. Portion sizes are large and very filling. I personally got the spicy kimchi rice with tofu as the base, but there's also chicken, veggie, and beef options for most dishes as well. There's indoor and outdoor seating options, or you can get your food to go as well.<//text>

<review>First time eating here. It reminds me of canteens or hawker style restaurants in Asia. The ingredients are all delicious, but the wheat noodles are not very well flavored and have a lackluster texture. Service is lightning fast and portions are generous. There is equivalent or better Chinese food you can get if you're willing to drive, but if I were close by and had a  hankering for a Chinese meal, I would come back.</review>< UserId.>

Quality was great. Tasted amazing. Paid for extra veggies and was very disappointed with it. It didn't look like there was very many on there. There needs to be better communication and description about that. If you charge for extra, you should deliver.<//text>

The food here is so tasty! The dishes are very flavorful and fresh. They offer vegan and vegetarian options as well. And the portion sizes are perfect, not too big/not too small. It may be in an odd location but don't be deterred because its well worth it.< /text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Convenient location in downtown near parking at the transit station. Good selection of noodle and rice dishes with vegetarian and vegan options. Pricing is about average for what you get. Ordered the curry tofu with rice. Descent sized portion. Food wasn't all that flavorful, somewhat bland, and required some hot sauce to give it some kick. Other than that a good place to get a quick bite to eat in downtown.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Always tasty and quick service. The staff are nice and there’s even shelves with snacks and stuff right near checkout. The dishes unfortunately do not come with very much meat and I for some reason get different portion sizes every time I come despite getting the same thing each time.<//review>< user>

Staff are friendly and service is great. Its location in the bus stop was off-putting to me until I actually came in and tried the food. Now, it's just super convenient.< /Review>< gmapID>

<Text>Love the vibe and price point here. Get in line to order and then find a table. Fast service means quick turnover. People aren't really lingering. First time here and we got the spicy green bean dish with chicken, which was really good. Spicey, gingery and a bit sweet. Good portion size served over noodles. We also got the sesame soup with veggies. It was tasty. Less spicy and also somewhat sweet. Very sesame. I enjoyed it but probably would get something different next time, partly because there are so many interesting sounding options! We also got the green onion pancakes which were some of the best I've had. They were so light and flakey, almost croissant like in texture. We will be back to try more! Good deal for the price. Tasty and laid back.</Text>< Pictures>

Small family ran establishment next to the bus stop. Big menu of so many different types of noodle dishes to try. They also have some other things like side dishes that are tasty. The peanut salad was delicious as well. Spicy ginger soup was light and tasty. Spicy sesame was creamy and delicious.<//Text>

Classic Bay Area region Chinese food. Don't let the odd location fool you (Greyhound/transit station), this place has exactly what you want to eat and at a decent price. Not enough seats for your group? Hover a little bit and you'll find your spot. The turnover here is quick.<//Review>

Teriyaki chicken was very flavorful. I would recommend that. Very hot and stuffy inside the building. There is a lovely outdoor dining patio so eat outside!</Text>

Betty's Noodle House is easily one of favorite places to eat downtown. I've had at least 10 different bowls; each one tasted great, didn't cost much, and was plenty filling.
However, their noodles are perhaps a bit too appealing with the space they're working in: their relatively-small dining space is almost always packed. In my opinion, it's worth it to order and either wait for a table or just take your food to go.</review>

Great soup and noodle dishes. Can't go wrong. Generous portions for a reasonable price. Only complaint is the location--you have to brave the aggressive hobos and other seedy people hanging out near the metro station, but that's sadly downtown Santa Cruz in general.</Text>

<review>The best thing about this restaurant is its location. It locates right in the metro center. It is quite convenient when you take the bus to here. Food here is quite good. There are many options including noodles (of course), dry noodles (similar to spaghetti) and fried rice. This restaurant is operated by a Chinese immigrant family. Food here is authentic Chinese. Chili sauce and spice has been tweaked for average Americans, though.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Surprisingly good food. The location kept me away for years. I'm glad a friend finally took me. They have some excellent noodle bowls. The location is still quite a turn off, and it is quite busy most of the time. That said, good food.</text>

<Review>I am very disappointed in the service I received at this establishment. I came here last night excited to try the food due to the high ratings I received from my friends. I ordered the beef Pad Thai and I was shocked to find out that I only received traces of beef in my Pad Thai. The meat to noodle ratio was disappointing, I paid an extra $2 for little to no meat and a bunch of cheap noodles. I also ordered two veggie egg rolls that my friend and I waited an hour for. We asked twice about the status of our egg rolls due to the fact that we were going to be late to see Lego Movie 2 later on in the night. The second time we asked, they simply placed two random egg rolls in the microwave and handed them to us. They were warm on the outside but FROZEN SOLID on the inside. I do not recommend this restaurant and I will never come back here again.</Review>< Pictures>

Betty’s appears to be permanently closed. The sign says they moved to Monster Pot on Front. Sign at Monster Pot says they feature Betty’s menu BUT DO NOT BE FOOLED. Monster Pot doesn’t have pho, the main reason to go to Betty’s.<//text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>My absolute go-to place for noodle soup, especially when I have a cold.  The Tomato Noodle soup is one of the best soups I've ever had.  In hot weather, they have noodle salads and other noodle dishes that aren't hot soup.  You can't go wrong.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the ambiance is that of a fast food joint.   Highly recommended.</review><gmapID>0x808e6a9d7d0e43cf:0x27439dbfd75a74e0</gmapID>< user_name>

This place is terrible! We ordered soup which was really good until the weird salty msg acidic seasoning on the chicken leaked into it.. I love salty foods but this was something more than salt our mouths felt tingly and numb, I dont know what kind of stuff they use for seasoning but it's definitely  ot healthy.</Review>

You cant tell from the outside, but this is surprisingly one of the best noodles in Santa Cruz.
They just know what the are doing!
If anything it's the best bang for your buck.

Try the Ginger noodle soup!</Text>

<text>Honestly I was not impressed whatsoever, I ordered the Pad-Thai and the flavor was mediocre at best, not spicy & the noodles were insanely long! They were so long I found it extremely difficult to eat. I also found it to be on the epensive side of things in the area, especially because of the SMALL proportion. I would not return to this restaurant again. Also a note for the cook: you need to cut the noodles up, some of the noodles you served me where 3+ feet long. Also you don't have any knifes available and only plastic forks. I feel like with main dishes costing 11$ you should at least provide knife's & metal forks so people can try to eat your food.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Betty's Noodles, despite it's location, is phởnemenal! Affordable, big portions, and  absolutely delicious; can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Great for vegetarian and vegan diets.  My personal favorite is the Spicy Ginger Soup with extra Veggies with the Spicy Peanut Soup coming in a close 2nd. Closed on Monday's and everyday for a few hours between lunch and dinner shifts.</Review>

Sad that this place was put up after I left! On a trip up to Santa Cruz I hit up this place and it was really great! Enjoyed every bite of my noodles and the price was VERY reasonable! Don't be scared by the location! The ambience is really warm! Would come again on another trip!<//review>

Decent noodles, but bland. Still better than most other Asian food you can get in Santa Cruz.<//text>

<text>I'm impressed...it was delicious. I was skeptical because I'm from the South East and it was different and really didn't know what to order. I went simple and did wgg fried rice with shrimp. Watching everything come out the kitchen, I wish i had tried something else although mines was perfect. Probably best I've ever eaten.</text>< pics>

The food is great, but the place is usually packed with customers. Otherwise, price is good enough with the food served. It's a "bus-yourself" place, so definitely keep that in mind when you're visiting.< /Text>

Had a spicy ginger noodle soup. If you are into spicy food, this was one of the best noodle soup I ever had. My girlfriend had a spicy peanut noodle soup, it wasn't nearly as spicy as mine but delicious nevertheless. I am definitely eating here again.</review>

<text>Very authentic flavors and dining experience. Order at the counter and find a table to enjoy your meal. Noodles aren’t homemade but the broth, veggies and meat were fresh and flavorful so overall our meals tasted great. I’m on a gluten free diet and although other options like vegetarian were listed, I had the beef pho and it didn’t seem to have any gluten ingredients and I didn’t have any symptoms. Im really glad we decided to stop here on our visit to Santa Cruz! Wish they served beer!</text><Rating>4</Rating>< userid>

It's kind of a hit or miss with this place. I had the ginger soup once and it was pretty good, but then had the sesame soup this last time and I was very unimpressed. It's hard to find noodle soups in this area, so I'll probably be back to try some more dishes. Let's hope next time is a hit!<//text>

Edible I guess but definitely not authentic asian food and would never come back again. More like a super salty Panda Express. I really don’t understand how this place has such high ratings.

My family and I ordered 5 dishes and they were all disappointing: chicken pho, teriyaki chicken, coconut curry, chicken chow mein, stir fried udon. Chicken pho broth is bland and subpar while the meat is dry and tasteless. Everything else was INSANELY SALTY!!!! Make sure to stay hydrated and drink enough water after eating their food if you do want to try it.<//text>

<text>Hmmmmmmm!! We ordered pad thai, sweet & spicy pork, and spicy garlic sauce w chicken. All were just sub-average. This place would be perfect for college students who are looking for quantity not quality. I would try different food next time, maybe i will find something better next time.<//text>< Resp>

<text>Betty's House of Mediocrity:

So I was with friends on my way to see the Lego Movie Part 2 when we decided to eat at Betty's noodles. Now I had ate here twice before but with deliberations from my friends came back a third time. Like the three little pigs this third time would blow the house known as Betty's noodles down.

For preface to my readers I live in LA and thus am an experienced culinary expert of Asian deliquesces. My first two encounters with this spirted away type place was that  of an experience tasting dining hall mayonnaise for the first time, completely underwhelming. The feng shui of this restaurant gives the vibe that it might be hiding a secret treasure like the classic movie Steel.  In reality all it held to me was overpriced poorly spiced cups of poorly flavored spires like soup. It has the lie of Asian noodles in it but the disbelief of McDonalds nuggets.

Now that you have a bit of back story as towards my charterer and can believe the story/review that is thus to come. Excited for the Lego Movie we went to eat and experienced a normal ordering process at this restaurant. The staff not particularly nice but not New York mean. To note the way they handed back my debit card was that of the ferocity of a koala that has had his eucalyptus touched. I ordered the shrimp chow mein and sat outside because the inside is cramped and full of the standard American family. Not to trash on their life style in this college ruled city, but they should sit their children outside in the cold to teach respect.

The food took it's time to come to me much like my Spanish ex-girlfriend. The water inside was empty and thus I had to Mission Impossible another jug of water for my friends. I served all my friends water as the modern gentleman should. When the food arrived the egg rolls we had ordered was missing and my friends dish had not arrived. Hungry like the wolf I was forced to chow down before my friend who is a GIRL could get her food. The lights flickered outside because my power was growing at the anger of the missing food (the flights actually did flicker). My friend who is a GIRL eventually got her food but the egg rolls, no dice. The ferocity in me raged much like that of the oppressed democrats in our modern times. Like make peace negations a friend was sent to retrieve the eggrolls twice.

I had almost given out hope that the egg rolls would come. Rage fueled my every action and I almost picked up the number stand and hurt someone. My pacifist ways were falling to the side. My morals. My values. My everything. Fading into the void, the despair, the utter nothingness. Then like a ray of hope the egg rolls rived like Jesus on Christmas.

I had never seen anything more beautiful besides my mother. I bit into it dipping it into the sweet red sauce. I dig my teeth in gently like gnawing a kit-kat. As I bite down I feel the soft warm shell crumbles into the frozen waste land. The center of this egg roll was frozen cold like in a freezer cold. I kid you not we waited an hour for microwaved egg rolls. We paid mind you for these garbage poorly cooked rip-offs.

My body was so full of rage I tossed the egg roll and cried out in despair "These are microwavableeeeeeee!!!!!" But my words were met with nothing but laughter from my friends. I had become a shame, a fool who plays his own game. I have lost all I have loved and loved for nothing. I had the Legos too look forward to but the husk of my body could not move without rage. I left the restaurant as soon as I could and tried to wipe the memory out.

It has been a day and I am unable to forget the tragic events that befell me at the place I no longer shall name. I will never give this place my service again and forever will remember this day.

MARK THESE WORDS:
To all that venture to the House of Betty's
What May Meet you
May Greet You
But do not let it beat you
The service is slow
The egg rolls are cold
The prices are absurd
I shall see you in my nightmares</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808e6a9d7d0e43cf:0x27439dbfd75a74e0< /gmapID></record>

I used to live in Santa Cruz and can't believe I missed this place! I was in a bad mood when I walked in and this ramen bowl completely flipped my mood. Family staff isn't exactly charming, but the food more than makes up for it. The monster bowl #12 had me vocalizing my bites the whole time.<//Text>

Food comes out pretty fast, decent vegetarian options, I didn't love the sauce on my dish, and some things were greasier than I'd like. Good vibe though!< /text>

Tasted the spicy garlic with rice and chicken. Overall good food, a little too sweet for me. Also had the Korean chicken wings, basically wings with spicy sauce and kimchi, not bad.</text>

So good, best hot and sour soup and the portion is awesome.  Nice people, did have an accident with a piece of pork in our vegetarian soup once but accidents happen. The food/quality us worth the visit!< /Review>

This is really the only ramen shop in santa cruz county but I travel to san jsoe often and this place holds their own against many other places. They dont have anything too exotic or even an oxtail soup but good broths and downtown location is great.<//Text>< Pics>

Food was okay, I had the No.28- Hoisin Udon Noodle	$8.20
(VG) (S) Thick udon noodles, cabbage, carrot, onion, and bok choy sauteed in a smoky hoisin sauce
It satisfied my hunger. My lady had
Spring Rolls with Shrimp	$6.50
Rice vermicelli, shrimp, bean sprout, lettuce, carrot, and mint rolled in rice paper and served with mild peanut sauce
Spicy Cucumber Salad	$4.50
(VG) (S) (N) Thin-sliced cucumber in spicy tangy garlic vinaigrette topped with sesame and scallion
The spring rolls were bland they had no mint leaves or cilantro. The cucumber salad was delicious if you love cucumbers you must try. As I walking out I saw someone eating chicken Udon noodle soup and it looked good wish I had tried that.< /Review>

< Review>
Walked in ordered our food, sat down started looking around noticed the sauces containers were caked up with old sauce , and the container with the utensils was filthy, the floors, the walls, the windows, the tables! Everything was beyond filthy. Went to cashier (which I then noticed how gross the counter and behind the counter was) asked him to cancel my order because it was dirty and he told me it was a waste of food, then couldn't find my receipt due to there poor system, and told me to wait , so I waited and he just continued to ignore me, so I walked out with no a refund. I almost went back to take pictures of the filth to post. I have never refused food from a restaurant because of hygiene.< /Review>

Ok -- Yelp has wishy-washy reviews for this place, but I LOVED it. It's a beautiful small wonderland of Asian pop culture the minute you enter this small place and the food is outstanding. Fresh lotus chips (awesome) and the yellow curry noodle soup was among the best ever  -- anywhere -- perfect balance of spice, sweet, and citrus.  Can't wait to go back - so much on the menu I still want to try!</text>

Betty's has become one of my all time favorite spots in Santa Cruz, the food is constantly amazing. I've tried quite a few different dishes here and even the ones that are lower on my favorites list are still way better than most of the other Asian restaurants in santa Cruz hands down. One of favorites is the hoisin hoisin udon noodle bowl. Plus they do their tofu really well, it's never wet or mushy it's always firm breaded and flavorful :).</Text>

I don't know why it took me so long to eat at Betty's. Maybe it is the less than attractive location in the bus station, but do not be fooled. They serve a wide variety of noodle dishes and noodle soups. I had the Sezchuan noodle soup, and it was (almost) as spicy and delicious as the dandan noodles I ate in in Chengdu, Sichuan.</review>

Betty's Noodle House is a treat, especially with some friends. While the location itself is not great, considering its built into the Santa Cruz Metro Station, the food is definitely worth the price. It can be congested, but the staff is kind and service is pretty fast.
I'll definitely come back with my friends on occasion.<//text>

<review>The selection of food here is pretty impressive , especially for Santa Cruz, from Pho to Chinese dishes to Ramen. Foods always been decent, seating can be a problem and the bus stop isn't the best place to hang out  and dine downtown.< /review>< UserId.>

<text>vegans: this restaurant has a vegetarian/plant based diet  menu that could only be better if it was completely vegan.

For protein the only choice is tofu. They DONT yet have mock chicken, faux beef & duck which is sad because those products (from suppliers like vegefarm intl in San Jose & lax-e in L A) have significantly more protein than tofu. It tastes better and has great texture too.

Note: Thai Basil in Capitola Village has faux meat products so on days you're needing more protein than carbs, just go there. That's a nice alternate if Bettys is SUPER BUSY (like they often are).

So, what's good? Try the spicy Thai Basil curries 🌶, Spicy sesame noodles soup and maybe Chow Fun noodles‼️ to round it out.  awesomeness.

The price is right. Parking is easy. There's free wifi. The location is fantastic for a day out shopping too. The staff are very polite and efficient. Why not five stars then? Only the lack of faux meat protein coupled with the reality they do serve actual meat here caused me to remove one star.  I'll keep eating here although not as much as I will Saturn Café or Dharma's.</text><user_id>107620288311361543300< /user_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>4< /rate>< Gmap_id>

Drinks and food are great decent price considering the food overflows you played unless you're absolutely starving you will definitely bring home leftovers for later, waitress was nice and pleasant but could have been a little more attentive but other than that all in all it was great it's been many years since we've been here we ordered a small and a large strawberry margarita and then food.<//text>

<text>DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!

We were visiting my parents from SD, came here because of the great reviews...🤬  you gotta be kidding me, the smallest Burrito I had ever seen.... ever! (Picture compared to my tiny hand) My husband ask to confirm the price and they told him it was gonna be $6.50, but when my husband ask for NO rice and beans, they told him it was gonna be $10 instead, my husband was already upset they have changed the price, but he was furious after seen the size of that burrito, if you can call it that. Obviously the regular size burrito must be all rice and beans, because they end up overcharging him for half a burrito, that actually ONLY had meat, onions & cilantro on it.... nothing else. Worst customer service, defenetly not coming back here ever!!!!!!

Update: was NOT a carne asada burrito, not sure what it was, it was greasy & NO taste whatsoever, got a stomachache and end up throwing it away. So disappointed, I was looking forward to eating one after my C. Treatment. 😭<//text><gmapID>0x80c3663f6ed8acd1:0xfc56fa58e16fa5e3<//gmapID>< date>

I love their food! I always order tacos al pastor. I've tried tacos at other places but I feel like the meat is too dry or too hard to chew sometimes.  but this ones are just the way I like them. To drink i get either a glass bottle coke or orchata.</review>

I would give more stars if I could. I'm only sorry I don't live in the area any more just so I could come back for more.
They were busy and it's a wait for food, but worth it.<//Text>

If I'm craving a torta in the middle of the night, this is the spot! It might be a little sketchy after 12am sometimes but you're good! I always get their torta de asada w/o avocado. Their meat is always seasoned and cooked perfectly. If you like salsa roja ask for extra bc their salsa roja is amazing!! Spicy but delicious.<//review>

Ssso good. Rolled in from

<Review>Worst tacos I've ever had, I got 2 steak and 2 Carne Asada. The steak tasted like unseasoned old chicken and was beige and the Carna Asada didn't taste much of anything. Both had onions and very little cilantro  and none of them had a sauce and didn't come with pico. Rice didn't taste of much,  and come on the gray refried beans were disgusting. First and last time customer.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c3663f6ed8acd1:0xfc56fa58e16fa5e3<//gmapID></record>

Very delicious food and I mean it tastes as authentic as it would at home and the horchata? Man o man don't get me started. The only problem I found was outside when a homeless person walked  up extra close to me for no reason and the security didn't say a thing smh but food is so good nothing has stopped me from going back</text>

Up here and There's not that many, but unfortunately when ever is answering ther phone orders has the worst customer service ever shes rude hangs up or straight tells you you can't order over the phone. You guys have good food and most of the time very nice but today after calling 2 left on hold for 20 min then got hung up on I don't think I will continue to go there.. Management needs to address the issue and get her of the phone and in the back were shes not dealing with loyal customers.</Review>< Resp>

<Review>I wish I could give them 0 stars!!! Please be aware before you eat here. They do not appreciate their customers. I spent $70 here on tacos came back in because they forgot 2 of my tacos. Instead of making me the 2 they forgot, they treated me like a liar. Wanted to search with their hands all through my tacos in the middle of a pandemic!!! Like are you kidding me! I kindly asked for a refund. I will never do business with them again!<//Review>< Pics>

I can't visit Bullhead and not stop at El Charro Restaurant...
They make the most delicious handmade CORN && FLOWER TORTILLAS in this State HANDS down!!! To top it off, they have 4 DELICIOUS Salsa's and one of the 4 is 🔥🔥🔥 I couldn't tell you about the desert because I could never get that far, what i can say is their service exceeds most restaurants!<//review>

Its a really good place and the carne asada burritos are amazing/tacos.
BUT the environment is disgusting, a homeless man is coming up to you and staring at you, people were fighting, crashing cars and some of the customers are just well...< /review>

Attention raza!!! Do not support this restaurant. They do not give lunch breaks to their employees. They only have 15 minutes to eat and rest. The owner takes advantage of the employees and they don’t get paid well either. The only way they will learn is if you stop supporting them.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽<//Review>

<Review>So my first visit was great , no issues with the food or service. So I decided to go back a few days later.
Second visit The food was tasted good but we got sick from the chicken tacos. I’m not sure where they got the chicken from but it definitely wasn’t cooked fresh. Also the cashier didn’t seem like she wanted to be there.< /Review>< date>

< Review>
I was disappointed they didn't do hard shell shredded beef tacos, which is what I was searching for, but the street tacos we did get were pretty damn good. I had 2 al pastor and 2 carne asada tacos, one kid had chicken, and the rest of the kids did carne asada with guac on them and we were all licking our fingers clean. I did think the place was a bit dirty in various areas, otherwise I Would be given them a 5.< /Review>

The tacos where good and there pretty good at giving you your order in timely manner but the place itself was okay. The desk and chair were all written and marked and scratched as if it was taken out a high school detention center. But it was good food</Review>

<Text>I ordered the lengua fries because they look so good in the picture. I was sorely disappointed, frozen crinkle-cut fries with cheese sauce that looks like Dollar Store mac and cheese. Bland and flavorless, except the lengua that tastes like dirty dishwater. I've never eaten here before, and I'm never going to eat here again< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMowZLtehiL8FljqxuhPFtFr5yyo5Zfc-IsuCul=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c3663f6ed8acd1:0xfc56fa58e16fa5e3< /GmapID></record>

Busy place, nothing fancy. Meats are seasoned tastefully. Small menu. Chile sauce is delicious. Beans have always been freshly prepped, not one visit have I experienced stale ingredients. This is a good spot for simple tacos. I have yet to find another place that triggers my urge to revisit. Open late. Area is kind of questionable. Staff is also nice. If I crave, this is the one to visit (in the daytime).< /Text>

One of the only 24 Hr places to go to for food if you want some Mexican food and to dine-in. Food was really good for what I've ordered but the cashier I dealt with wasnt as efficient as I'd liked was the only problem I had. Salsa is really good and really hot which I like. It's hard to find a salsa here in the desert that doesn't just cater to Caucasian people who like anything mild or de-seeded.<//text>

<text>Well this is the first time that I've gone to Tacos Mexico. I found myself on the road headed home and wanted to eat. But I did not want to eat my regular burger or fast food. I just happened to be passing by Taco Mexico next to the entrance to the Highway 15 South so I decide to go there and get a couple tacos. I noticed that the tacos were a little small so I got a burrito to go along with it. The people that work there were friendly and courteous I received my taco my burrito and some green sauce and some napkins and my soda. All I can say the food tasted great to me I had no complaints at all. And I invite everyone in the area. I would invite everyone in the area to give it a try. Good things come in small packages and restaurants it appears. Enjoy
Oh the only reason that I gave a Taco Mexico 4 out of 5 Stars was that the whole time I was there I was a bit cold I think the air conditioner was on and it was still just know just a little bit cold for me otherwise I enjoy the whole time I was there. And the bathroom was clean.

Very good. But for a 1.50 the tacos can be bigger. And if you'd like a different meat. The price goes up also. Overall good.</Text>

Food is decent. My carne asada burrito was a little on the salty side. They could clean up the look of the outside a bit. The service was really good. Everyone was very nice.<//text>

Mediocre "Fast Food". not a lot of flavor. Staff knows how to roll a burrito to make it seem like it's big and full. Not a place to bring a date, just a fodder stop when hungry and nothing else is open.  It used to be a good place, back in 2012.< /Text>

First time going to this place. I expected so much more I ordered an asada,buche, tripa and chicken. Let me tell you my tacos were so GREASY they were drenched in oil. Yes, I know tacos should be a little greasy but these were super drenched in oil. Which made the tacos nasty and uneditable. Never coming here again.< /review>

If it's late and you have a taco/torta/sope/burrito craving then there's really nothing else. It's not really good but it's really not bad. Also its questionable when you are coming here late since it's pretty shady come nightfall. I say dont come by yourself, and if you do, come with the Heater. It's a shame since Castaneadas is literally walking distance from my house, but they'll get the review that's due soon.</review>

The service is great. Clean enough place. The burrito was way to spicy. I like spice but your average carne asada burrito should not be that hot with out warning.<//review>

<text>The food here is terrible cashier lady is very rude yelling at all the customers because of the mixed up order numbers. Restrooms are also very nasty. In the mens room the sink doesn't flow out properly so it takes a long time to rinse your hands.

Food was good. Would definitely go back. Tripas were good, but a little too crispy for my taste, I will ask if they can make them a little less crispy next time. Pollo asado was good as well. Red sauce had a good spice to it and green sauce wasn't spicy, but still had a good taste. Wait time was about average. Food was warm when it was brouhy out.</Review>

Right off the bat cashiers aren't the friendliest Ok place to go eat some tacos. Meat was too cooked and dry. Prices are a little high for the food you get. I wouldn't return.< /review>

Their tacos are good, their carne asada fries not so much. they use nacho cheese instead of grated cheese, not a good mix. No free refills. But the tacos are bomb<//Text>

Great tacos,i would recommend the carne asada tacos also if you're looking for something to fill you up get a torta.The bread was cooked nice and evenly and the meat is just as good,maybe even better< /text>

<review>Cashier was nice, cook was super slow and couldn't talk and work at the same time. Got a ham breakfast burrito with beans and sour cream. Tortilla tasted fake, hash browns compared to that of McDonald's, beans were a little too soupy for a burrito and were mediocre. Eggs were pretty alright. Best part was the sour cream. One of the saddest burritos I've ever had.< /review><Name>Jacob Ruis<//Name>< GmapID>

<Review>No long line but there always busy 247. They got a security guard manning the door so I didn't feel unsafe like it use to be. Clean tables n booths for dine in. And friendly staff who all speak English n Spanish perfectly. Good size portions for the carni asada nachos. They are a must. Everyone's #1 stop in the HD for 247 real authentic Mexican food.</Review>< pictures>

My family met and ate here just to try it out.  My daughter woke up the next day throwing up then my son, spouse and myself had big time diarhea amd stomache cramps along with throwing up. This place is the cause for sure!!! I will never eat there again. My wife is pregnant and suffered pretty bad stomache cramps. The food came out way to fast! Plus, it wasn't even good. So not worth the foos poisoning episodes we all took home with us. My advice. It's dirty. Go somewhere else!!!!!!</Text>

So-called Mexican food taste like ass but I guess that's what you get when you hire dumbshit's that are running it. All they're worried about is the new chronic they got from the dispensary and it's in my car I want to hit it on my break. This place is not recommended for any kind of food consumption.</review>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Absolutely horrible!! How does this place have multiple locations and stay in business? Took my wife and her friends out for tacos after a night of drinking.
Tacos Mexico being one of two things open. I wish we would have choose del taco instead.
In short, just a horrible example of Mexican fast food tacos.
Cold,  dry ,crunchy and tastless meat. salsa was watery and bland. exreamly small portions were served. this place SUXKS! I would not stop and eat here again if they were giving it away FREE!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Food is o.k , my problem is Everytime i order  Al Pastor Burrito. They give me a Carne Asada burrito. I don't drive Across town to get something i didn't order. I always order the same 2 Al pastor Tacos & Al Pastor Burrito . They get my Tacos order right. But Give me WRONG Burrito . This is the 3rd & final time i come here. Even after bringing Their error to attention  They Continue to Screw up. PLEASE Talk to your EMPLOYEES. Give The Customers What they order. Not to hard.< /Text>

The only thing I can say about this place is the same thing I been saying we may have a light bunch of!!Taco's restaurans but only here at tacos;Mexico you will find only the best made from scratch beans rice & red  green salsas.The meats are prepare prepare dayli my favorite one is Al pastor & buche they also serve orchata or rice water like they called here.Great Menue & Great Food I recommend.< /Text>

<review>Not impressed, but maybe I didn't order the right things. I tried several meats in tacos with the idea that I was going to get a burrito to go with the meat I liked the best from the tacos I'd tried. I tried the carne asada, langua, carnitas, al pastor, and a couple others. I left without getting the burrito, and went somewhere else to get more food. I wouldn't go back to this place. The other places like los alazones, and all the Alberto clones are way better, and in some cases much better priced.</review><userid>100378289586731803817</userid>< Date>

<userid>113271962458974000733< /userid><Review>Love taco mexico so i used to go to the one in san bernardino until they changed owners and food kinda changed so i moved to high desert and seen this one so i wanted to try. The food is great like i remembered but customer service kinda sucked. Me and my brother only ordered 2 little tacos each and it took almost 20min other customers that came after were getting there food before us. And when we recieved our food it wasnt even hot😞<//Review><Time>1516212887961</Time>< user_name>

<Text>They don't serve the plates as shown in the pictures, you have to pay extra for the cream and other stuff that is supposed to be in the plate already , and the girl attending even gets mad if you tell her about it. Me and my family are not going back there to eat again.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) I been going from mexican restaurant to another mexican restaurant and this is the best home made MENUDO.
I've been testing from one restaurant to another often. And this one of TACOS MEXICO, is the Best of the Major MENUDO, which I have tried. It does not have so much fat, the meat is soft and the flavor of the broth is original. Simply PERFECT, almost good. Hahaha Advantage.
