<Review>I have taken my 63 Ranchero in twice and I have been extremely happy with the honest and professional service.  I was not overcharged or misled or condescended to while explaining what was happening with my car. I will continue to take my vehicles to Sierra Nevada Tire and Wheel. Thanks guys for not taking advantage of a " little old lady" 😉</Review>< pics>

These guys are wonderful. Travis, Jon, Victor and the rest of the crew have always been there when I've needed them. They are honest, down to earth, friendly and do great work. I always trust them with my vehicles and they don't over charge. Important now a days. I genuinely would recommend the Pollock Pines location to anyone. Thank you guys for everything!!!<//text>

I took three vehicles to Sierra tire and wheel. New tires for one, oil changes on all three, and they found a cracked valve cover on one . They were able to repair it quickly and at an affordable price.  Chris and Ben were very professional, courteous and fast. It didn't cost me a fortune either. I will definitely be doing more business there.</Review>

<user_id>117203263979676497714<//user_id>< Review>
Incredible experience with Sierra Nevada Tire in Pollock Pines!

So last September, I took my truck in for an oil change and had them check the brakes. They asked me if there was anything wrong and I told them no, just that I've had the truck 10 years, driven 65,000 miles and have yet to replace the brakes. I get my truck after service and they say the brakes are fine. Probably 30-40% left, but still OK. I was pretty pleased that they didn't decide to just tell me I need new brakes and charge me ... I would have said fine and never known any different.

Now today, I had brought my little Honda Fit in because I heard some light grinding when the car was rolling - this was without the braked being used. I thought uh-oh I must be close to metal and metal and better get the brakes done before I've got to replace the rotors too (been there, done that in years past). So i get a call this morning from them telling me my brakes are fine, not need to replace them - but they did notice my tires needed to be rotated and did so. OK - i was fine with that. Also - again thinking they could have just replaced the brakes and charged me and I would have been happy.

So here's the kicker: When I sign the receipt - it says $0. I question the fellow - and he says "...brake inspections are free..." I then say, "but you rotated the tires...". He said - "well, I had them off anyway....just come see us when you need new tires...". You're damn right I will! In fact, that's where I'm taking both vehicles for all service. WOW - an HONEST car service place!!!! Had I gone to a dealership they would have charged me through the nose and probably found more things to "repair" and charge me for.

What an incredible experience. Sierra Nevada Tire gets all my business for now on! Thank you!!!</Review>

Honest mechanics. It's nice to find an honest shop. Makes it worth it. Piece of mind knowing I won't be taken advantage of. Got my brakes done there.  I found out from my neighbor later that they are family owned, very honest, and highly reputable.<//Review>

It's a gas station and the price is little higher than other gas station, but the gas is good and gives you more miles on your vehicle.< /review>

<Review>Its dirty outside, in the short time I was there i saw a huge rat lumbering around the bushes, got hit up for spare change (they are brazen enough to knock on my window so playing invisible isn't gonna work), and was denied use of the restroom (I was told they don't have one but why did I see a bathroom sign on a door on the side if the building?)</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I took my Cadillac here after being in an accident. They got my car in right away, and did an awesome job keeping me updated on the repairs. Derrick was very informative and helpful during the entire process. Through the whole process of the accident and dealing with insurance, my experience at this location was exceptional. I highly recommend them!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

They washed my car and even buffed my headlights after repairing my collision damage - which wasn't part of the deal. It looked great! We had a huge snowstorm that shut down the entire town, *and* even with needing to order additional parts, my car was still returned sooner than they said it would be! Everyone in the office was extremely professional and kind. Excellent place to do business.</review>

They were knowledgeable and always keeping me updated about the progress of the repairs. Car looks awesome. Had a minor issue with the alarm and tire pressure alert and Brandon took care of it with no problem. Brandon needs a raise, very courteous and polite young man< /text>

<review>I must say # 1 rule in bzness: treat the customer with genuine respect and care.
This venue came highly recommended and was sabotaged by an uneducated, unscrupulous employee answering client phone calls. She was rude , abrupt and unpleasant in her tone, demeanor and choice of vocabulary.
Unfortunately, I will not be seeking the services of this supposedly reputable company .
I think her name was Ashley.  Hang up if she answers and run for your life!< /review>< rate>

Caliber Collision repaired my car which was involved in an accident.  They kept me informed throughout the process, thoroughly diagnosed all issues, replaced or repaired everything, repainted and returned a car in perfect condition.  You can't tell it's been in an accident!
Great customer service!  Highly recommend< /text>

Very bad experience with Calliber collision, they had my truck at a separate lot just parked for over two weeks they didn’t fix anything, they wouldnot get back to me in a timely manner, very bad communication with customer, the guy wasn’t being honest, and when i told him i wanted to take my truck to a different shop because they weren’t fixing it, he refused to release it & giving me an attitude.

<Text>Worst mistake going to Caliber Collision. My vehicle was covered in overspray. My white charger was damaged on the left side panels. After I received my vehicle I noticed overspray all over my black rims, interior and a large drip mark on my rear trunk. I had taken my vehicle back 5 times and they still didn't resolve or polish out the overspray. complete lack for detail and extreme lack of care . Would highly not recommend. I am still finding more imperfections and damage that wasn't even caused from my accident but was caused by Caliber Collision.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Before choosing an auto repair company to service my vehicle, I went on Google and read many reviews and I find it unfortunate that there are not a lot of good reviews on auto body repair companies in this area.  So I thought I would just choose the lesser of the evils and I kept my fingers crossed. But my experience with Caliber Collision leaves me confused as to why they don't have closer to a five star rating.

The one problem I had was not with Caliber Collision, it was from Enterprise, which was a result of my own insurance company dropping the ball. Caliber Collision provided Excellent Service through the entire process. When I dropped my vehicle off, I was in the office for 2 hours waiting for my rental, and I had my two dogs with me who barked at anyone walking through just begging for pets or play. They were very courteous and kind, I feel they went above and beyond what my expectations were.  They kept me updated each step of the way, and surprisingly had car completed earlier then expected

I would definitely recommend Caliber Collision to others. This experience with them far surpassed my last need for auto body work done.  I had to return 3 times for missing parts in addition to them severing my trunk opener connection, which cost me to have repaired elsewhere.

Thanks Caliber!</review><Time>1599467564653<//Time></record></dataset><record>

I took my car to this place, they were wonderful people, but they had to take my car to the dealer because Caliber couldn't find what was wrong with it. Once I got my car back, I found out that my car's suspensions also need to be replaced. I ended up paying for the deductible to Caliber and paying Kim's Automotive to replace suspensions. I would recommend Caliber only for body work.</Text>

Absolutely fantastic service! Professional, competent. After fixing my hood dent they also fixed the shaking of the hood in my Honda Pilot that Honda had failed to fix despite multiple attempts and I had even involved Honda above the dealership level.<//review>

You want my business and you can't take 5 minutes to look at a few scratches. NO one else was even in the waiting room, or in the parking lot for that matter.

Not customer friendly at all. Bad business!!!<//Text>< rate>

Very bad customer service to start. Costly repairs (paid by insurance company of responsible party involved in accident) poor repairs on hood almost an inch on separation, wind sounds inside while driving, worn front  tires due to bad alignment, loose nuts on front tires and when vehicle was taken in after the job was completed for inspection for noise in front tires they didn't even took the time to inspect it. They said for me to take it to another place for repair and if it was due to the accident they would pay the bill. I would not recommend this place to anyone.< /text>

Don't use these people.  Shady is hardly the word but can't think of something else to discribe them as without using word that would not allow this post.  Wish I could prove it somehow but I am sure that they screwed me and I was actually sent there by my insurance company which makes it all the worse.  Dorped car off in Indio CA and they could not even work on it because the weren't a Mercedes Benz certified repair shop and had to send it to a shop 76 miles away and it took 7 days to get a estimate to state farm. I never saw my car again.  Remember I drove the car there just fine and somehow it was totalled.  No f-ing way.<//text>

It is a workshop that in my case was an experience very bad for me, some of its staff with a terrible treatment, Mr. Wilson very bad experience when talking with him, to have that position leaves much to think about. (If people were less selfish and put themselves in your position, things would be the best way). It is the name of the workshop that only makes its fame! 🙇🏻‍♀️<//Text>

Very professional, friendly.  I received quick service replacing the tires on my travel trailer.  Other places I checked had only foreign-made tires with a 1-2 week wait. Richard had quality Made in USA tires in stock and installed them quickly.  I would highly recommend RIchard's Mobile Tire Service.<//Text>

<Review>Richard is the best of the best and you'll be hard pressed to find a better fellow anywhere in California, nevermind North County.
My husband and I were referred to him by our trusted mechanic and his recommendation did not go amiss!

His prices are completely reasonable, and his flexibility and service is next to none. He is entirely transparent in his pricing and aside from being a lightning quick and adept worker, he's just a real groovy dude!

Do yourself a favor and give him a call next time you're in a pinch! Thank you so much, Richard - you're a lifesaver!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< review>
Richard's mobile tire service is a pleasure to do business with. My 40' Diesel pusher needed new tires and Richard helped me pick out a brand and model that would work great for my purposes and within my budget. He came over to my RV storage and put the tires on without me even having to be there. I just got back from my first trip and what a big improvement in ride quality and handling. I couldn't be happier and highly recommend using Richard's for any RV or Semi truck tire needs.< /review>

As a disabled USMC veteran I have some trust issues to say the least He is the only tire guy I trust in the area. I am a mechanic suggested customer. I am loyal to the same mechanic for a decade he sent me to another shop for work they didn't do tires and sent me to richards. I had to get a plug on my tires I asked him how they looked he suggested new tires because of the rot they had from sitting from when I first bought it. Contacted me the next day with a quote that had every detail and I trust him. I am so thankful he came to us and put a brand new set of tires on my 1977 American Clipper RV. Great price great work. Highly recommend. Very professional and great attitude.I<//text>

I didn't even end up going with this service. While his prices are cheap, I ended up going with a different company due to the lack of professionalism when talking on the phone. I was going to meet him for a tire plug, and was still going to charge me the $90 for driving to him. I would understand this price if he was coming to me. When I asked him about the price he answered "well what did you expect?" Then as talking to him he talked to me as if I was speaking in a language he didn't understand. I was desperate to fix my tire so I had my mom call because I felt disrespected when I called, and she was as well. While he has cheap prices, I rather not spend my money to a company that talks to me like I'm a toddler. I ended up paying $50 more with a different company, but it was worth not having to deal with a childish attitude.< /Text>

<Text>Richard was easy to deal with and did the work while I was at work. Reasonably priced, and went the extra mile for me. Would highly recommend and use again in a heartbeat, especially considering I have an RV and bringing it in on my schedule is slim to none. Thanks Richard for a job well done.<//Text>< pics>

My fiancé’s tires got slashed in the middle of the night and my insurance deductible is $500. I called discount tire in Oceanside and they referred me to Richard and he was AMAZING!!! Literally was here within the hour and already have 2 new tires on the truck! Super friendly and really a great guy! If you are ever in need of a mobile tire service, LOOK NO FURTHER!!!! Almost half the price of my deductible! Put his number in your phone! Thank you so much Richard and we’ll definitely be recommending you from now on!!<//text>

Totally professional, prompt, highly skilled and very fair cost of service. Fully outfitted truck with every imaginable truck tire service tool, all well organized. Richard was an absolute pleasure to work with. His many years of experience were obvious! Unfortunately, people like Richard are a dying breed. Hire him while you can!</Review>

We were stuck on the side of the highway. AAA said the tow truck would be 45 min to 1 hour and our kids are in the car and it’s raining. A quick Google search landed me on Richard’s website, I called, and Richard was there in half the time. They didn’t just tow my car and leave me at the side of the road waiting for an Uber or a taxi. He brought out the exact tire I needed and replaced it on the spot. Thank you!!!</text>< date>

First time I used them was a tire blow out on the side of the freeway. They got me back on the road ASAP. Now I use them once a month or so when I find a leaking nail in a tire when I get back to the office. I don’t even have to be there. I’ll call them and head home and come back the next morning to a repaired tire and pay the bill over the phone. Yesterday they found and additional tire with a nail and it really saved my butt.</Review>

Richard is an expert in tires and a life-saver when it comes to getting the "big" jobs done well. He saved us a lot of stress when he came to change our split tire at the house (lucky we weren't stuck on the road). Great job!<//text>

<review>So kind, helpful, fast-working. Truly a master at his craft. He knows what he is doing! Fixed the rim on our wheel minutes. Could've charged us an arm & a leg, but was kind enough not to. Got us from Cali, back home to Utah. We truly are so grateful for his kindness & willingness to use his knowledge & expertise to help us get on our way.
He was an answer to our prayers. Can't thank him enough & couldn't recommend him more!< /review></record>

Lines are always long here I'm the 17th person in line with 4 other people behind me all the way to the door. And only 3 tellers serving people. Honestly we all know this is pointless to post cuz BOFA it's too big to care. Only thing keeping me here is the hassle of changing to another bank. But I'm honestly getting tired of this b.s.<//Text>

This branch is a joke. Teller and manager did not accept deposit because it was missing the title in front of the name. (Example: Sr. John Smith) the check only had John Smith. Ridiculous! Terrible customer service.</text>

Awful. This particular "Supervisor" tells me l can not deposit or cash my bofa check because l have a business account & that l would have to wait 3-5 business days to cash a check (same employer for 2 years whom of which also banks with bofa). Then l tried the A.T.M twice now & unable to deposit my cash? Bank needs to be fixed. I now drive 20min. Further just to avoid the nonsense.</Text>

This is the worst bank in the Antelope Valley! I cant believe they only have 3 tellers literally everytime I come in the lines are extrememly long. The customer service alone is horrible they are RUDE! As you can see the ratings they have on Google talks for them self. The managemnt here has to change! Clearly they dont know what they are doing and have done nothing to fix it. I understand maybe you guys dont want to hire more ppl. But atleast enforce good customer service you walk out this bank with a horrible experience makes me wamt to cancel my account. Hopefully someone in this location reads there reviews and takes action cause as you can also see they dont even reply to the reviews on here!< /text>

Long line as always might as well write a review. Only 2 tellers and 10 employees walking around or hiding behind a computer acting busy</text>

Bank charges $8 for a $25 check despite policy published stating they only charge for checks over $50.  Criminal banks are criminals, beware.< /review>

< review>
I needed to stop into a B of A to deposit for my client, I usually go to the Palmdale Blvd or 40th West.  I walk in and it was packed! I used the business line (client has business account) they gave me a hard time , told me I shouldn't be at that window. Not once have I been asked or questioned about being in the business line at the other B of A's . I would suggest the tellers be given another lesson in customer service .Probably the worst bank experience. If I didn't need to be there I would not have stopped by. Next time I'll stop by the 40th west B of A - totally worth the extra 10 minute drive.<//review>

Great sales people, no pressure to look around, great prices at least on the items I purchased. My son was pleased with my purchase so he went back and purchased a bunkbed and they gave him a great discount. Great shopping experience, thank. You Ramos Furniture!<//Text>

Me and my partner have been buying our furniture from here for years. Recently, we moved out to an apartment and Armando was really helpful to accommodate our needs during these stressful times. Our couch was delivered with everything that it came with and we've enjoyed it ever since.</Text>

<review>Went in to check out new bedroom furniture just to browse and ended up finally finding high quality wood furniture at an unbelievable price! I have shopped around to other furniture stores in the area and online places like Wayfair, IKEA and Overstock. Ended up buying a whole bedroom set for the best price ever! Also ended up buying a couch and loveseat floor model that was leather for both couches $1500 with delivery! Can’t wait till they get delivered tomorrow! The staff greeted me immediately upon arrival and were very helpful! Thanks Ramos!<//review><response>None< /response></record>

From the minute we walked into the store we were greeted with great customer service. The staff there were helpful not “pushy” like some sales reps. Their products are excellent prices and quality. It was more than what I thought it would be. They kept in touch with us regarding status of our order up to the day of delivery. Delivery was excellent as well. On time, very professional! I recommend this place to anyone looking for quality product, great service and excellent prices! We still need more items and we will definitely be back!! Thank you for your service!!!!<//Text>

< review>
We are new in town (relocated from the east coast). Did some window shopping Friday evening and saw a table we really liked.

We came back Saturday and browsed inside for a bit.  I loved that there was no pressure sales pitch; we were approached and told to let them know if we needed assistance.

We did purchase the table; we picked it up Sunday. Armando was great and helped my daughter and I load the table and stools.

I highly recommend Ramos’ for great pricing and super support. We will be back.</review>

<Text>The persons that came and did the delivery assembled my bed. We didnt have a matress so we could not try it out. Once we bought the mattress our bed made so many squicky noices. We could not even move without macking noice wich is very anoying.We decided to take a look and ALL the screws holding the bed frames were so small that there was nothing holding them in place. My husband had to go and buy the screws and do it all over again. I wish I knew how to upload pictures in here so u guys could see how ridiculously small this screws were. Never buying anything in here again. Not cheap and no good cuality.<//Text><UserId.>107142719550722454086<//UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

(Translated by Google) It is a very bad place to buy. Very few professionals do not have people to put the product in the car you have to do it yourself. They give you the wrong wrong product and leave you waiting for the right product for a month. Products you already paid for

(Original)
Es muy mal lugar para comprar . Son muy pocos profesionales no tienen personas para poner el producto en el carro lo tiene que hacer uno mismo . Te dan el producto mal equivocado y te dejan esperando el producto correcto un mes . Productos que ya pagaste< /Review>

<review>After a long time looking for a good doctor, I thought I found a doctor and staff that care for the patients. Well I was wrong, I was miss treated this morning when I went there for heart issues. I called and they scheduled me for a visit at 8:10 this morning, and when I got there they said that I’m not on their schedule! They finally had me to see the doctor, and I tried to let the doctor know that I was miss treated by his receptionist he said he doesn’t have time to listen to me! What kind of the doctor would do that to the patient? If he has no time to listen to a patient, then obviously he doesn’t care about his patients health either!
I wouldn’t recommend this doctor and his rude staff to anyone.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808ff282278fdb25:0x21fc10595f13d09a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I saw Dr. Temkin during quarantine, and he was pleasant enough. I agreed to have my blood drawn, so went to LabCorp. Dr. Temkin's office called a few days later and insisted that he needed to speak with me about my lab results in person (over Zoom), but that my insurance would cover it. I was skeptical, but worried that there was something seriously wrong with my health. Turns out the topic was a vitamin deficiency (which I was already able to view online through LabCorp), and I received a $130 bill for a 5 minute phone call. I called the office and his staff was incredibly rude. Insurance won't cover this cost. I have never had a doctor take advantage like this, and would not trust him again. Take your business to one of the many other doctors in the area.< /Text><Date>1596469808407<//Date><resp>None< /resp></record>

The staff are very efficient and very good in their responsibilities.
Dr. Temkin, as usual is very professional,  takes time to explain and answer questions. He keeps up with my medical progress and history and advise on necessary shots and lab tests.
Wait time have been minimal.</Text>

<user>106082108721222148834<//user><Text>I'd gone to Dr. Temkin because of abdominal pain. It wasn't severe, but it was worrying, since I had no idea what was causing it. It had already begun to fade when I got to his office. He found my abdomen soft and said to wait and see, rather than jumping into a long series of diagnostics tests if it was just a passing discomfort. That sounded good to me. Knowing that I could see him again if necessary was enough reassurance.</Text>< time>

<Review>I have been to the hospital for my Anuual preventive checkup and they did nothing but BP check, measured my height, weight and charged $200.

<Review>Dr Tempkin is personable, available and extremely knowledgeable. I have had several unexpected illness and each and every time he accurately diagnosed and referred me to Some of the best doctors in the Bay Area. You will feel very safe under his care. I highly recommend him for anyone looking for a doctor that takes the time to listen and talk to his patients. I remain a very happy patient.</Review>< pics>

Dr. Temkin has been my doctor for about a decade. He is everything one would want in a doctor - caring, communicative, and knowledgeable. He listens carefully to what I have to say, and is a wealth of information. If I need to see a specialist, he will recommend it. If I have questions about a drug, or a treatment, he'll give me his honest opinion, and if there's something he doesn't know, he'll find out. Not only that, but he's a nice guy, and very easy to talk to and feel comfortable with. If you are looking for a personal physician, look no further.<//text>

<Review>Dr. Temkin runs a very well organized office. He has picked a very competent staff. It is always possible  to see him on short notice; he doesn't allow his schedule to get so crowded that he can't accommodate such a request. On top of that he knows his business. He has been my doctor for over 15 years,<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Dr. Temkin has been my primary care physician for over ten years now. It has been fascinating to watch how he has maintained and grown a private medical practice in a background of continually increasing government regulation and its associated expense. In this time his attention to patient first has never wavered and his health service offerings to patients has steadily increased. Fred M</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Staff is rushed at every aspect. Dr. himself is very rushed. Been told to just take Advil and go home and I can look up treatments online for my shoulder. Went to another doctor they had much better diagnosis with treatments I can use. If you sneeze or cough then you can go to him otherwise I would go to a actual doctor.</Text>< Pictures>

A very good doctor. No problems with doctoring. Can  be hard to get hold of on weekends and Mondays sometimes but that only happened once and I haven't really needed to contact him on weekends or Mondays enough to know if that's a recurring problem.< /text>

<Text>My husband and I have been going to Dr. Temkin for years.  Imagine my surprise the first time he called me with my annual lab results and everything was fine!  He just wanted to let me know and make sure I didn't have any questions.  Dr. Temkin is so good about treating the whole person and remembering what is going on in your life.  Perhaps the best example of his full service is when my husband had an allergic reaction when we were out biking.  We got an immediate phone consult and initial assessment and Dr. Temkin saw him as soon as we got there.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Tania Hanson-De Young</user_name><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>109231181815959029519</UserId.>< Time>

I've been seeing Dr. Temkin for about 10 years and absolutely love having him as our family doctor.  He is one of the few doctors it seems that takes time to listen to his patients and partner with them on treatment options.  I never feel like I'm in a rush and he doesn't pile on appointments so closely that I end up waiting a long time in his waiting room or the exam room.  If you want a doctor that listens and cares for his patients, look no further than Dr. Temkin.< /Text>

Dr. Temkin and his staff have been wonderful and very supportive.

I started the LeanMD program a few months ago and have lost 20 lbs. and feel great! The program is easy to follow and I love the fact that I eat healthier now, have more energy and look and feel good, and I look forward to exercising and taking long walks.

It's a great program!<//review>

Dr Temkin has been our family doctor for 20 years and my girls still see him even though they live in San Francisco. Dr Temkin takes a natural approach to healing as much as possible and I like that we don't walk out with antibiotics every time we have a sneeze or cough. He is a truly concerned professional and his office is run very well.<//text>

Extremely professional, warm, and friendly environment.   I have been a patient of Dr. Temkin dating back to when he was in Danville!  He is understanding, supportive, and  leaves no rock unturned.

Years ago when a family member became very ill and was hospitalized, the specialists couldn't figure out what was wrong.  I placed a call to Dr. Temkin to let him know what was happening.  He came to the hospital, and within two hours had the problem figured out and a surgeon lined up for emergency surgery.  I will be forever grateful.

I highly recommend Dr. Temkin.< /Review>

I have been a patient with Dr. Temkin for about 10 years now.  He and the staff are always friendly, courteous, professional and knowledgeable.  Besides seeing Dr. Temkin for general care I have also been a patient in the Lean MD program and lost 57 pounds over 5 months!  I would definitely recommend him.</Review>

Dr. Temkin takes his time with his patience, asks questions and encourages a back and forth so you leave knowing all you need to know about your visit, you know.
And I must say that when my son reached out for help dealing with a tough emotional time, he took the time and helped.
A great guy!<//review>

I had heard good things about DOs in general from friends and I was very eager to see what doctor Temkin, a self proclaimed DO - as advertised - had to offer towards my health and well being!  Within a few minutes into my conversation with Dr. Temkin, I was completely disappointed. His response was (despite the fact that he sells himself as a DO on the Internet),  that he has a little bit of training as a DO, but he is really a family practitioner/Internist.
I was truly dumbfounded and didn't know what to say! At the time of my visit, I had severe acid reflux problem among other issues and in dire need of immediate medical attention, but he seemed completely indifferent and for the next few minutes he completely wasted my time by telling me how he spends the first session of a new patient to just say hello and to talk about totally irrelevant matters! This was one of the worse experiences that I have had with a doctor and a complete waste of my time and money. Charging people very handsomely to just say hello to them! Simply unbelievable ...<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

As a longstanding patient of Dr. Temkin, it is without any reservations that I highly recommend him and his staff. Rarely do I wait more than 5 minutes. Dr. Temkin doesn't just treat patients, he builds relationships. The rest of his staff responds in kind. Dr. Temkin's and his staff's bedside manner is consistently outstanding. Sometimes I think my blood pressure actually goes down when I'm there. Beyond the personal touch, I've been thoroughly satisfied with the quality of treatment over the many years. Great doctor, great staff!</Text>

Not only has Dr. Temkin saved my life by correctly diagnosing and IMMEDIATELY sending me to the ER, I have been going to Dr. Michael Temkin for 15 years and love him.  He listens, is concerned and takes his time determining the best course of action and is selective  in his choice of referrals for you.

Thank you Dr. Temkin< /Text>

Dr Temkin and the staff are always fantastic.  Prompt, and always courteous to me.  I have sought healthcare with Dr Temkin as my primary physician for more than 15 years and it has always been a great experience.  When I’m ill a prompt diagnosis, swift treatment, and a speedy recovery puts me back on my feet quickly.  We keep a watchful eye out on family medical histories and maintain a normal annual physical that helps me avoid trouble.

I also used Dr Temkins weight loss program after battling with typical diet programs, and the results were enormous.  I lost over 58 lbs during a short few months that dramatically improved my life.  I was able to reduce ongoing medications in a very short time.  And found his weight loss plan extremely effective and easy to follow.<//text>

Dr Temkin has been my primary care MD for over 15 years.  He has been the best I have ever had, and I am 70.  He is caring, intelligent and pretty much on time!  I have never had a misdiagnosis and I have had some issues over the years.  I took part in his leanMD program and have kept most of my previous excess weight off over the last 10 years.  His full staff is a direct reflection of Dr, Temkin.  They are highly efficient, very cordial and will do anything to help you.  So I am happy to recommend Dr. Temkin as a top primary care physician.</review>

I have been doing the LeanMD weight loss programme here since March. All I can say is I am sorry I didn't discover it years ago. A programme that works, with encouragement from a very friendly efficient saff. The plan itself is very sustainable as it is more of a lifestyle than a diet and is easily adjusted to suit the whole family.....What more could you ask for!..<//review>

<review>Not an office to choose if you're looking for actual health care, only if you're looking for a diet plan. Claims they are accepting new patients but couldn't schedule a physical sooner than four months out, sounds like they shouldn't be accepting new patients.

I'm also highly suspect that this is the only doctors office with so many google reviews, and that all the 5-star reviews came within the past 8-9 months.

8/15/2017 -- I'd like to post an edit to this, I went for a single visit to this office to discuss some issues I'd been having, namely balance and pain regarding my back. Upon visiting this office I was told by this hack that "I have nothing at all wrong with me" and that it was all musculoskeletal problems. Well I had an MRI of my entire spine a couple of weeks ago from a doctor who cares about more than some weight loss scam, and it turns out I have foraminal stenosis all over my spine, a bulging disc, a degenerative disc, and a bone spur on the tail of one of my vertebrae. I implore you that if you care at all about actual medical help please stay away from this man.</review>< user>

< Review>
To: Dr. Temkin and staff,

So to start I wanted to on the make a heart filled thanks, for the all the Doctor’s help and his understanding and wonderful staff.

I have been seeing Dr. Temkin for about four years now and as time has proven, he is professional and capable medical doctor. He is very approachable, friendly and with attentive on details, on my health and well being.

He gave me confidence, that I could bring my stats into a healthier place and since I am not one of his Lean MD patients, he still encourages me to lose weight. And I have lost over 25 pounds. in the last four years and steadily now staying around 183-185 pound range , in this last 2015-16 year.

Doc, thanks for the extend handshake and wonderful kudos for doing a good job on my mindset, my healthcare and good healthy choices. This is a Happy New Year 2017's for me, starting with an excellent physical check-up and I feel great too.

Again Thank your awesome staff for me, everyone of you helps makes it easy and possible for my better healthcare futures. Always a joy to see everyone of your the staff.

Cheers,

Barry< /Review>

I've been going to Dr. Temkin for over ten years.  A careful listener and compassionate doctor, he takes time to understand my symptoms before providing a diagnosis and suggesting treatment and/or medication. When I do need a specialist to look deeper into a particular medical issue, Dr. Temkin has been supportive in recommending one to me.  I've had doctor's in the past that try to do it all themselves.  In contrast, Dr. Temkin recognizes when it is appropriate for a specialist to step in, which I truly appreciate.
Dr. Temkin comes across very down to earth, not at all pretentious or arrogant, as I've unfortunately experienced with past doctors in the San Ramon area.  He has earned both my trust and respect over the years and I've referred both family and friends to him.  I feel blessed that he is my primary care physician.<//Text>

<Review>I was struggling with lingering chest, cough, and breathing issues. As an asthmatic, the winter months were particularly troubling. Dr. Temkin and his staff were phenomenal in tending to my needs. I need afternoon appointments and they were always able to schedule me - most often the same day I called.

Dr. Temkin listens to my needs and concerns as a patient. He is careful to prescribe the necessary prescriptions, but not overprescribe. He is experienced and attentive. My condition was tricky to handle, but Dr. Temkin's expertise and sage knowledge cleared my cough and lungs. Thanks, Dr. Temkin and staff :)!<//Review>< Pictures>

I have always struggled with the 10-20 pounds that just will not come off, no matter the amount of exercise, food deprivation or the newest diet craze.

But I finally found the answer for me!  I’ve reached my weight loss goal using LeanMD.  It is real wholesome food, I prepare simply and easily.  When you sign up for the program you get an easy to follow plan, recipes, portion control and weekly weigh-ins and pep talk!

After reaching my goal, I treated myself to a Coolsculpting procedure on both my neck and thighs.  I am very pleased with the results and I have kept the weight off.

For me….LeanMD was the answer and Coolsculpting was the cherry on top!

Thank you Dr. Temkin!</review>

<text>I have never before had the pleasure of having a doctor that is available to me in an emergency.  Dr. Temkin does everything possible to be available by phone or meet you in the office.  We had only been with Dr. Temkin a short time when my husband had an allergic reaction while we were biking.  Dr. Temkin got on the phone right away with us, coached us thru the situation and met us at the office as soon as we arrived.  Another time we needed guidance after hours and he responded right away.  Our family also has medical issues that aren't common and Dr. Temkin is more than happy to learn more about the illness and genetic disorder.  I can't recommend Dr. Temkin enough.< /text><GmapID>0x808ff282278fdb25:0x21fc10595f13d09a<//GmapID>< rate>

Dr. Temkin has always been professional, understanding and caring. I've been sering Dr. Temkin on and off for 9 years and he's always shown interest about my health and shows me ways to keep myself healthy. His medical weight loss program that's also provided within the office has been a huge game changer for me. I'be lost 45 lbs in 4 months. I reccommed Dr. Temkin to all my friends and family.<//Review>

<Text>If you need to book a last minute appointment, Dr. Temkin's office can usually accommodate.

I came back from my Thailand trip with an allergic reaction so I wanted to get everything checked out. While I was there, I had all of my questions ready for Dr. Temkin, but he was only able to give me very vague and general answers on how to treat my allergy. I also wanted to get my blood work done in the same day so I was sent over to the nearby lab which was only 5 minutes way -- very convenient!

However, after my blood work results came in, the doctor's office called me to say that "labs all look great" and that was it. I asked for a copy to be sent to me and it's a good thing I did because I scanned through the paperwork and it turns out I am considered to have borderline high cholesterol. THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

I'm someone who exercises 4 times a week, I'm in the healthy BMI range, I've done the BodySpec DXA scan (breaks down your body region by region into fat, muscle, and bone) and it showed that I'm in the athletic range, I am mindful of my intake and don't eat processed foods, but I am bordering high cholesterol -- almost certain this is due to genetics. Dr. Temkin should have let me know so I can be proactive about my health, instead of giving me the generic "everything looks fine". Really disappointing and I will be looking for another physician who cares about helping me maintain/improve my health.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Dr. Temkin is a DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) and not an MD. I had to look that one up. They are both fully qualified medical degrees. And Dr. Temkin has been board certified in Internal Medicine the same as any MD in his specialty. But I really appreciate the DO philosophy. There are a few techniques that DOs utilize which MDs do not. But beyond that it seems like the training really encourages building great patient relationships and looking at medicine from a whole person perspective.

Dr. Temkin's staff is absolutely fantastic. They all work incredibly hard and are very professional and helpful.

I highly recommend Dr. Temkin if you're looking for a GP.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I have been with Dr Mike for well over 10 years through, weight loss program, flu shots,  ingrown toe nails, an arrhythmia detection that led to my receiving a new aortic valve, and Annual physicals that are quite through. You just can't find a better Doc.< /Review>

<name>BobKat Higginson< /name><Text>Tried to take advantage of the buy 2 get on free and what a circus. NO WHERE does it tell us to order the 3 and they will credit one. The offer is only good as well if you order online and its impossible to get your sub customized online since they do offer every option online. They had me void my order online [but no one could tell me how] and then order 3 with the credit popping in at the check out amount. THIS SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ALSO WORKING WHEN THEY TRY TO SPEND MONEY WITH YOU. What an awful experience, we will not be back. The specials are not worth the hassel it takes to use them.</Text>< Time>

Last time I will go to subway. Ordered 6" turkey combo. The lady only put 4 slices of turkey and one slice of cheese. What a ripoff. I do not like vegetables so my sandwich  was very small and not worth the $9.03 I paid< /review>

We have have here before for sandwiches and service was good so we were in a pinch and needed a platter for an event. Went in and they said they couldn't do it and needed 24 hour notice for a platter. 24 hour notice for 5 sandwiches cut into pieces. Sounds good! Went to the other subway on Avocado and the manager there Chris hooked us up and got exactly what we needed. At least subways are everywhere!</review>

She makes the sandwiches so perfect that each and every bite has all the ingredients. I have switched from my other lunch stops to Subway.

< Review>
went in there today and got a salad and a 6ince sub combo
I got charged for 1 12in and 2 6in subs
Plus a kids meal
My mistake I didn’t realize this cause most of the subways I go to are efficient
Plus I used to work at one
The girl who served us was slow and then when I got home I called multiple times and there was no answer

This plac bothers me
I don’t plan on going there again<//Review>

I found the office staff to be extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. The office ran on time for my appointments; it’s nice not to have to wait for hours to see a doctor. I felt I was in great hands and know that they will be able to help me with my injury. It’s so Nice to find a specialist who acts like your family doctor! I highly recommend them and am excited about getting well ❤️❤️❤️<//text>

<Text>After weeks of waiting to get the right specialist in Victorville from my primary doctor, I was finally referred and approved to see Dr. Nayyar.  I showed up 20 minutes before my appointment time, filled out a health questionnaire, and I was seen almost immediately afterwards. My visit was with his associate, Erika Franco, NP-C.  Upon telling her the reason for my visit and my concerns, she explained to me the necessary steps and provided the possible treatments/procedures to follow.
Very knowledgeable and friendly staff. I'm looking forward for my next visit and hopefully will get positive results and/or the proper treatment and remedy.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< Time>

They are very courteous and respectful toward the patients. They are very prompt and on time if not ahead of schedule to take you in and explain all that is wrong with you. I appreciate them telling me the pros and cons of my situation. I would definitely refer their services to whoever would need them.< /review>

The staff here are very friendly, courteous and helpful. They are engaging and treat all my concerns with care. I never feel like I’m just a number. They are very personable. And Dr. Nayyar is one heck of a doctor. He truly knows what he’s doing and that he’s looking out for my best interests. He really impressed me when he said that he wanted me to have a hand specialist perform my surgery and not himself because he wanted to make sure that I got the best possible outcome for my situation. Can’t ask for anything better than that!!</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><name>E Z</name><text>After having a complete knee replacement was given a prescription for one pill of  hydrocodone 5-325 once every six hours. After spending 3 days in pain at a+10 level and not reaching anyone over the July 4th weekend finally got ahold of the Dr. who said it was ok to take two. Within hours the pain became manageable. Nobody could believe such a small amount for a major surgery was prescribed. This experience was torture. Be sure you ask and get a prescription with information about amounts.<//text><Date>1625951055016<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Excellent Doctors, techs, and staff something often lacking in our medical community in the High Desert.  Everyone is professional, courteous and well informed.  I highly recommend them.  I get knee injections there and am also referred to Dr. Nyyar’s brother at VV Global Medical Center for shoulder and S.I. Injections.  ALL of these have worked quite well and better then my previous injections from pain management.</review>

From my first phone phone phone interactions with Jackie and Kim T., I was extremely impressed with the knowledge of the front office staff and how they worked with the precision of a well-oiled machine to get me in as quickly as possible due to the potential need for surgical repair of my fracture. Once in the office, I encountered another young lady who took my vitals, PMH and set me up in a room. I am normally diligent about names and while hers does not come to mind, I was seen on Friday 5/14/21 for an 0800 appointment, if that helps, and she was equally impressive. I also encountered Glen who set up my films on the computer and then assisted with an immobilizer for my shoulder after I visited with Dr.Surdyka. I could tell that demands on Glen’s time and attention we're many, but being a health care professional myself, I quickly recognized the one-on-one care and consideration that Glen showed me even as much in demand as he was. I have equally wonderful things to say about Dr. Surdyka too. He explained my injury very clearly was and even so generous with his time as to explain things to my young adult daughter who drove me to my appointment and has been frantic about my injury. He displayed extreme respect for her concerns just by his behavior toward us in the office that day.

I worked 10 years in a surgical practice many, many years ago. I started at the bottom of the pile, just making phone calls to verify benefits but worked hard, learned many different positions, and when I left the practice had become the office manager. I can be very critical of customer service, especially in a clinical setting but the entire staff, physician and otherwise, at Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Institute blew me away! Thank you all!<//Text>

Dr.Nayyar is hands down the best by far! Dr.Nayyar and his staff always have smiles on their faces! I am so thankful for him and his friendly and knowledgeable staff. I have had many questions and concerns during my procedures and during my recovery time between the two surgeries I have had with him within the last year. Both Dr.Nayyar and his staff has been accommodating and eager to make sure I have all my questions answered. I would highly recommend Dr.Nayyar and his office.<//text>

I couldn’t be happier. Had shoulder surgery couple of weeks ago. These people are amazing. Dr Nayyar takes his time to explain everything. Kim is also been extremely helpful going through the process. From getting paperwork done, appointments with pre surgery and getting meds. I highly recommend them.<//text>

<name>Aislynn Stowe</name><Date>1578680996587< /Date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I’m writing this review in regards to the service my fiancé has received by staff at this location. I would like to start off with the lack of a website set up for this place for comments and complaints from patients is unprofessional. Medical facilities are inspected and reviewed for such amenities set up for patient use. It’s ridiculous that comments and reviews come through google. While the doctor here may be fantastic and gives patients the care they deserve; the rest of the staff do not. A patient’s first encounter coming to this location or calling on the phone is not with the doctor. Whether it’s a lack of training, lack of commendable applicants for positions within the facility or both, it would seem staff that interact with the patients do not give their full efforts. My fiancé drops off paperwork on a Wednesday with a staff member named Kim who then tells her the lady who takes care of the paperwork has a light schedule and should be able to get it done. Next day call, staff member Chris says he talked to nurse practitioner handling paperwork that it’ll be ready the next day (Friday). I called myself on Friday and am told it takes 5 business days for such paperwork to get done. When I inquire about doctors having admin time and such to take care of these paperworks I get told there are other people who are waiting on theirs so that’s why it’s 5 business days. So you’re telling me you’re so backed up that paperwork needing to be expedited cannot be? I hang up to avoid being “that patient” causing problems. I let my fiancé know so she calls to be the one. She talks to staff member Tanya who says the same things and further says Chris doesn’t remember telling her Friday. With things such as this, I’m to understand there isn’t a system set up in place to track phone calls by means of telephone consult notes in a patients file or anything of the sort to record what patients are saying and what staff members are saying? Going back to staff member Chris, he tells my fiancé when he’s removing her stitches that he’s going to work on her physical therapy paperwork that day; you think he actually started it or even the next day? Nope. My fiancé disability paperwork can’t be the only one with timelines that need to be met to be sent off, so you’re telling me that you have a stack of disability paperwork with timelines not being met and completed on time? I’m in the military in the medical field and even we have a better set up than this facility is exhibiting. The doctor I work with who used to practice in the private sector even told me that filing for temporary disability is a lot smoother and quicker process than filing permanent especially if it’s the actual doctor putting a patient out of commission. This whole situation and how it was handled is just bad business.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

The only thing I would say is he normally has a “poker face” and it could seem intimidating but I try my best to make him smile every time I seem him!
Great guy!< /Review>< rating>

<pics>None</pics><text>Dr. Nayyar is thorough, thoughtful and kind.  We have had two visits.  I have never had a wait time of more than just a couple of minutes.   Dr. Nayyar saw things on an x-ray that the radiologist missed.  He looks.

He's letting my body heal as naturally as possible- He's not looking to intervene with that process until the swelling goes down. I trust him with my leg and foot.<//text>< userid>

I am very pleased with the work No Moss Softwash has done on my roof, I needed moss removed as well as a good cleaning. No Moss also cleaned out my gutters. I recommend this local company for this type of roof work. Moss and algae can cause damage to your roof over time and this is the company to take care of it.<//text>

No Moss did an excellent job of cleaning mildew, moss, and algae from my roof, sides of house, porch, walkways, and driveway.  The people were friendly and honest in all their dealings with me.   They were hard and steady workers.  They were thorough, efficient, careful, and efficient.  I am extremely pleased with their work and the result - it all turned out even better than I expected.</Review>

Chris from No Moss came out to give me an estimate on removing and treating the moss growing on my roof.  After looking at multiple areas on my roof and observing it's condition, Chris told me I may be better off replacing it.  Rather than make a sale, he then gave me some guidelines to ensure I hire a reputable roofing coming.  Who does that?  I was really pleasantly surprised at his desire, first, to be of service.  Thank you Chris!  This is the kind of company I'm glad to recommend to others.</text>

<review>No Moss Softwash did a great job for me.  I literally had moss on my roof, my brick fire pit, my brick walkways, and cement where the water runs from the down spout.  They took care of all that for me through a softwash process, not pressure wash.  Chris was very thorough with explaining the process and what they could do.  The estimate was written to provide a breakdown of items so that I could pick and choose services. The two young men who came to do the work, were very thorough as well.  They were very careful with my property including plants, which were no worse for the wear after the process.  They cleaned windows off from any overspray.  They also did an excellent job at clean-up after cleaning both roofs.  When they left, everything was put back where it came from and the place looked sparkly.  I would definitely use their services again.</review>< pics>

<review>No Moss was here on Friday, Dec. 4, to clean and sanitize my roof. They use a 'soft wash' process rather than pressure washing. Chris (the owner) and his employee, Jordan, did a fantastic job.  They were here 6 hours and left my driveway, walkway and yard spotless (no moss residue left behind).  And washed all windows, too. No Moss may charge more than other companies for roof cleaning, but they are very detailed and earned every bit of the fee. They were very professional and polite. Chris explained the process and answered all my questions.  The bonus is a 5 year warranty.<//review>< user>

I was looking for someone to clean the vinyl sidings of my house and my solar panels. No Moss was the only one that especialize this type of cleaning. Jonathan and his partner did a good job my sidings are 13 years old but they look brand new after, same with my solar panel. I thank God for leading me to the right company. I called one but never showed up. Then Brandon returned my call.. I thank God everytime I have work done in my house I pray and ask God to send me the right people. God always answered my prayers. Glory to God.< /review>

Based on their excellent reviews, I contacted No Moss for roof and solar panel cleaning.  Brandon was out to do an estimate the next day.  I had a question about the equipment used on the solar panels, and Chris answered it promptly.  I accepted the bid and was scheduled for the following day, today.  Chris and Jonathan arrived on schedule, got right to work, and did a spectacular job of removing at least 20 years of moss and lichen buildup.  The roof looks new (it's 30 years old) and will only look better as the spray takes full effect.  The solar panels look better than when they were installed, and I'm sure it will make a significant difference in power generation.  I appreciated the care they took to safeguard and protect plants and trees, as well as their diligence in cleaning up.  As I told Chris, I will be recommending No Moss to all of my neighbors and friends.  Their attention to detail is off the charts!< /Review>

<text>I'm very pleased with my experience with No Moss! From the initial estimate and on-site discussion with Brandon, and the completed process and treatment of my roof with Chris. [and another worker].  They were both quite knowledgeable, professional, and willing to answers my questions, throughout the entire interaction. I choice their company [No Moss], because of its 'soft-wash' approach to cleaning and treating my tile roof. I would recommend this company, and would use its services again.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>Chris Lombardo and his crew cleaned the moss off our large two story house and the roof over the detached garage/apartment.  They were thorough and even found a place where gutter guards we had installed were not installed.  We never would have known.  Chris explained the entire process and took incredible care with coverage and plant protection and left our roof/house spotless.  The moss on east side was significant because we live in a neighborhood with lots of big trees.  We know the damage moss can do to a roof and had we not hired Chris - No Moss- eventually would have needed roof replacement. They removed a significant amount and the remainder is dying.  We recommend Chris his crew, who were wonderful, and No Moss without reservation. Call them. You’ll be glad you did!

These guys were wonderful! Cory and Jonathon who came out to clean up our house were so polite, on time, worked really really hard! I'm so impressed with the work they did on our entire house. I can't wait to see it evolve over time.

Chris who came out to take a look at our house and do an estimate was also wonderful. He didn't pressure us into anything and just gave the the info and that was that. Quote came quickly and we knew exactly what we were getting before work had even begun. I wouldn't hesitate to hire Chris and his team of hard workers!  Thank you!<//text>

Made an appointment for your guy to come out and give me an estimate. It was for 9am and I waited and waited and no one came. Called the office and told them, he was 20 mins late and I wanted to know what was going on. She said she would call him. 45 mins later, I still did not receive a phone call and I called again. She said that he had a flat tire as was in the shop getting it fixed.  Don't you think a phone call would have been professional in this case? I didn't even get an Apology. I told her to just forget it all together.< /review>

This is one of the best experiences I had in years! Chris and his staff treated my roof for moss in August 2017 and, after a long day of hard work,  the roof looked like new. Yet they came back in May 2018, re-checked it and then cleaned some of the spots they considered "less than perfect". The return visit was included in the original price. They are quietly efficient, quick, professional and very friendly. The price was very-very fair.

Highly recommend Chris and his team. They were prompt, courteous, very professional, and kept my yard and my neighbor’s yard very clean during the entire process.   The best part is that the product they used to clean my roof and the stains on the driveway did an amazing job!  I will definitely use them again in the future.< /Review>

No Moss staff did an amazing job cleaning our stone patio. I actually believe some of those stones were cleaner than when they were originally installed! The two men were very thorough, very polite, and explained the soft wash treatment they were applying. We will definitely hire them again for our annual maintenance.</Review>

They did a great job and were very easy to work with, good communication thru the whole process.  Everything was explained in detail with all of our questions answered.
Chris's son was very respectful, knowledgeable and friendly, left the area clean.   After the work was done he showed us before and after pictures and explained all the was done.  Would definitely use them again and refer others to them.<//text>

No Moss did excellent work cleaning the gutters and downspouts  on our 6 building complex in Rocklin and on our block of duplexes in Carmichael.  Chris and his crew did a thorough job of cleaning the gutters and downspouts and they cleaned up beautifully.  No Moss leaves No Mess !
2018 is the second year I've used this company and I can't conceive of using anyone else in the future.  Their work is always professional, their price is very competitive, and Chris is a joy to work with.

You won't be disappointed if you use the services of this company.  No Moss does great work !<//text>

Chris and his crew of very nice young men just left.  They power washed the outside of my entire house, including two chimneys.  They also power washed the driveway, all sidewalks, patio, two large roll down shade screens on the patio, and my two outdoor rocking chairs.  I couldn't ask for a better job.  Everything is perfectly beautiful and clean.  They were even very careful not to step on any of my plants next to the house.  All mud wasp stains gone, rust stains gone, moss gone, and the house and gutters look freshly painted.  I highly recommend this company!<//review>

I have never seen anything like it. After my house , driveway and pool deck was cleaned by the moss guy I didn't have to wait to see results on my house . My house is moss free and each time it rains my house gets brighter like we just had it painted. It is amazing ! The best money I have spent on home improvement. I am so happy with there work and product .< /Review>

Chris and his crew came to my home and did an incredible job. I had moss all over my roof in the backyard. I tried to do it myself. I spent probably about 20 hours doing the east and west side of my roof with a power washer. My roof on the backside of my house is about twice the size of the others and Chris came with his equipment. He killed the moss and it looks beautiful now. I would use him again for sure. Very professional. Thanks Chris!<//Review>

<review>California No Moss is a highly professional company.  They did an excellent job removing moss from our tile roof and cleaning our gutters.  They were very careful of our outdoor plants and furniture and made sure that no residue was left on the outside walls or windows.  Chris, his son and the rest of the crew were friendly and very willing to answer any questions that we had which was very important for my wife.

I looked around for experts in this field..."soft washing"
I didn't just want a pressure washer...I wanted a soft wash company that knew what they were doing. I didn't want them destroying the roof or stuco on my home...
After talking with Chris, I was sold that this was THE company for the job. His price was slightly higher than the other companies, but his knowledge, reputation, and reviews, spoke volumes to me.
If you want Moss removal or property washing...look no further.
No Moss is the BEST!!!

Chris and his sons have taken care of my gutters and roof for the past few years now. I wouldn't use anyone else. This past year they cleaned my gutters, installed new gutter guards, and washed (low pressure) the roof to get rid of all the mold just in time for all the rain. They are great - very professional, courtious, and do exactly what they say they're going to do.< /review>

<Text>Chris and his son did a great job removing all the bacteria and moss that had developed over years and years, and quite honestly, gave our curb appeal an unwelcoming look. They first scraped off the existing moss and it fell off in chunks. Then they climbed on top of the roof and sprayed their "moss sauce" on the roof. As Chris explained, the solution over time will decompose and eliminate the moss in all the nooks and crannies on the roof. One thing he mentioned as well, was that with the first rains of the season, don't be surprised if you see the roof turn a white color and bubble up as the "moss sauce" gets reactivated with the rain water and will continue to do it's magic. My only negative comment is that there was noticeable chunks of moss around the house that I've been having to pick up and it got all on my patio cushions which will have to be cleaned somehow. It is an expensive process but worth it. We had the worse roof in the neighborhood and now it looks so much better. Chris and his son were very nice and worked hard.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Gmap_id>0x809ac752521dd4b7:0xed6203e6786bc36d<//Gmap_id><name>Bill A< /name><Review>I do not usually write reviews, but my experience with California Moss Control  warrants an exception.

I needed someone to clean the gutters on my two-story home so I entered my contact info into the Home Advisor search engine.  Chris (who I later learned was the owner of Cal.  Moss Control) called me within minutes to schedule an appt for an estimate.

I really didn't understand why a "gutter cleaning" company was called "moss control," but when Chris gave me the estimate he also schooled me on the corrosive effects of the green moss that was growing in my relatively new roof.  It was a form of black mold that feeds on the lye in the composite shingles and that spills off the roof and covers the sidewalk and driveway.  I always thought the green slime we dealt with during the winter was attributed to the northward orientation of our house--not so.  It was digesting my roof and the lye in my aggregate driveway.

So I agreed to hire Chris to clean my gutters, treat my roof and to power wash my sidewalks and driveway.

I cannot overstate how professional and expert he and his crew were.  They treated my property as though it was their own.  And they are environmentally friendly:  Instead of washing everything down the street gutter they opened my sewer and channeled all the effluent into the city sewers.

Yes, I paid for more than a simple gutter cleaning, but every time I walk out front or drive into my driveway I think of how thankful I am for the education Chris gave me.  He saved my expensive roof and ridded me of the green moss I had resigned to live with.  I will definitely use California Moss Control again and will recommend the company highly to all my family and friends!  Thank you Chris!!!!<//Review>< Rating>

Have loved coming here since the before-times. Their classic Tonkatsu (such a deep, rich broth!) used to have a deluxe option with additional toppings, like pork belly, and should be bringing it back soon.. exciting 😀

I've gone more than a few times and haven't been disappointed. The staff is super friendly, the menu is easy and the dishes always come out fast.</text>

Indoor dining tonight 3/26/2021. This a Japanese owned ramen restaurant. I had their black garlic tonkotsu ramen $15, geso (squid) fry $7, red rice beer $5, yuki white peach $5. Having ate over hundreds of bowls of ramen throughout my years in Japan, I can tell their ramen is authentic. The flavors are fantastic and when I closed my eyes, it brought back memories of when I ate at ramen parlors in Tokyo. This place is better though as I was the only person dining indoors. There's no rush feeling you get when there's a line outside waiting. Here are the reasons why I absolutely love their ramen:

- 味付け玉子 ramen egg soft boiled and is marinated. Perfect jelly on the inside
- broth is heavy and have been cooked for hours
- great garlic flavor
- perfectly soft chashu
- fresh noodles

My bill was $42 with tax and tip. Service here was excellent. Great job everyone at Waraku, especially the chef. My dinner was perfect.< /Review>

<text>Not sure why this is so highly rated. Maybe the food is better in person? I ordered ramen from here because my usual favorite place is closed on Mondays, but I was disappointed in the quality. The noodles seemed tough and the broth seemed oily. It didn’t even have a little swirly fish cake. :( At the time, I was willing to say that the ramen was “fine, not bad, not good, just fine.”

But later that night, when I went to the bathroom, I came to regret the decision entirely. Not to get too graphic, but it gave me digestional distress that left me stuck on the toilet for a solid hour.

So yeah. Never ordering from here again.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

As a big ramen fan,I didn't had a chance trying their ramen, terrible service, after sitting down for at least 15 to 20 minutes,no one came by.
That's not how you run an establishment,if your customer service is not good, what's the point if your ramen is good.</text>

The best vegetarian ramen in the Bay area! Finally a vegetarian ramen breaks it's limit. Using impossible meat, it tracends a traditional dish to be better than its original meaty creation.< /Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>In general the food is good! Broth and noodles taste good and poke salad is fresh and delicious... although I do want to complain on a little too much oil/fat on the broth and a little too much soy sauce in the salad so it doesn’t get 5 star for me. Waitress are nice but just like everything else it just missed the excellence.< /review>< Pics>

The best ramen I have ever had! I came during a weekday lunch time and had food on my table within minutes of arriving. The ramen bowl seemed like it works never end. Nonetheless, I licked my bowl clean by the end of the meal. Also, very friendly staff.< /review>

<Review>Spicy Tan Tan noodles were not spicy enough for me. Very good, generous portion and rich broth though. Braised pork belly don buri is divine. Well seasoned rice, soft boiled egg, and well-cooked, melt-in-your-mouth cubes of pork. A great meal for only $6! I wish there were more vegetables served with it. Karage chicken is some of the best fried chicken I've had. Tender dark meat served on a bed of greens alongside Kewpie mayonnaise.< /Review>< pics>

Tuesday night dinner for 3. Appetizers (goyza and edamame) and drinks came out alarmingly fast. Meals followed after a reasonable lag to enjoy first courses. Waters were always filled. Staff was very attentive. Broth was good quality, temperature was okay. If you like really hot broth I would mention it while ordering. Extra noodles came out on the side. The meats were not traditional cutting style but nevertheless were great. If you don't want a 100% traditional bowl this place is great.< /text>

<text>We ordered the Karaage, Black Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen, and Tsukemen. The Karaage and Black Garlic Tonkatsu ramen were pretty standard. I would not recommend the Tsukemen - the bonito flavor was too strong and overpowered all other flavors.</text>< Pics>

Not a bad Ramen place in an area full of them. Noodles and flavors are great, a little on the greasy side. But plenty of flavor. Deluxe option is good, more meat and add ins.

Dessert is a pass here. Don't waste your time on the matcha brûlée. Nothing is right here.<//Text>

The ramen was excellent! Wonderful service and great tonkotsu broth. The prices are reasonable (for SF) at about $13-15 for a bowl of ramen. Will definitely come back in the near future!<//review>

Very affordable for the quality of food you get, especially considering this is just next to Japan Town. The ramen I got was excellent. The meat was delicious, and the broth was just amazing. I would also highly recommend using the crusher on the table to add some fresh garlic to your soup!</Review>

Very good ramen (both roasted garlic - pictured, and classic choice). Sake was ok. We waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2. Service was good. Overall very content. I would def return.</Review>

Delicious Spicy Tonkotsu ramen with nitamago! I found the addition of cilantro tames the spice down a bit and brightens the flavor! Try the garlic Tonkotsu as well...you won't be disappointed!<//text>

I was in Japan for two weeks and I became addicted to ramen. I ate it almost every day while I was there. I'm usually disappointed when I eat ramen in the US because the flavor I not the same, I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted this please, it was very authentic and prices weren't bad. Highly recommended.</text>

I had the garlic tonkatsu ramen bowl. The broth was full of flavor, the garlic pieces were delicious for a garlic lover and the pork belly was good, although I've had pork belly elsewhere that was more tender but overall pretty good here. The portion sizes of the ramen were very big. We also had pork belly and rice, that was soft, juicy and even the rice was good. We would eat here again. I wish they had a child's bowl of ramen though, but now I know I could have shared mine because the portion size was more than enough.<//review>

Waraku how do I love thee? Let me count the ways…

1) You have gluten free noodles so I can eat Ramen with my gluten intolerant wife!
2) You’re open all day rather than having a break between lunch and dinner. I like to eat at strange times so this is GREAT!
3) You have shorter waits than the other Ramen restaurants around, I hate waiting
4) They have AMAZING tan tan men
5) What else matters, you should just go here.<//text>

Slow service but great ramen! Worth it! Tonkatsu Broth had a nice creamy texture. Be sure to add the fresh garlic. (Ask for the garlic smasher if needed)

Update tried the black black ramen! (No need for additional fresh garlic in this one.) It's a winner! I would highly recommend. My cousin also tried the tsukemen.

Update: wife got the roasted garlic ramen. Garlic was a little on the burnt side. She preferred the regular tonkatsu as well.<//text>

The best Tonkotsu ramen in JTown by far. Broth is rich and creamy. Wonderful on a cold, winter day in The City. Reasonably priced for what you get. Love their warm, gooey smoked egg in the hot broth. Pressing your own fresh garlic cloves is a novel idea. Never had that experience before. You do have to ask for a garlic press though. The best deal on the menu is to order the Kakuni Don instead of the Small Bites size for your table to share - you get Waraku's heavenly tasting braised pork belly, but also rice and more gooey egg. Also enjoyed their hot black tea, different from the usual watery green tea you get a Japanese restaurant these days. Service was ok, nothing memorable or outstanding (hence the 4 stars).<//Text>

The atmosphere is super cute. I love Japantown. If you’re downtown San Fran it’s worth the walk to check out all the Japanese (and Korean) spots. This ramen wasn’t MT most favorite of all ramens - the pork bone broth used a little too much of the fish stock for my liking and the noodles weren’t as fresh tasting as they should have been (very plain). I also removed all the bamboo shoots from my bowl as something seemed off about them. I was able to finish my bowl though. It was pretty good (I got tonkatsu ramen + spicy miso - oh and the spicy part comes in a little cube on the side and you add as much spice as you like - I used the whole cube and it wasn’t spicy). With so many ramen options in the Bay Area I wouldn’t return here.</Text>

<text>My favorite ramen in all of San Francisco.

We started w the seaweed salad and pot stickers, which were both super. Then came my spicy tan tan ramen... I like it spicy so most of the time I have add in chili powder, but not this one. My partner’s shoyu ramen was also a hit.

💯 every single time.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH3x1ZqBPkw41c_7BbJeLnyKKgiV73uaaaMReQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808580bed8e90009:0x4bfcacfeba03db0c< /GmapID></record>

So, so, sooooo.... good! I can't even begin to describe. My wife, daughter, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The staff was awesome. There was seriously a one and a half minute wait for our seats. ❤❤❤ We will definitely be back for more when we are in the area.</Review>

<Review>I got the tan tan. A lot of fat in it. Very unpleasant, broth was not as delicious as the other reviews say. Ippudo is much better. Nice place prompt service though. The ramen noodles were good also< /Review>< Pics>

<review>It was already 9pm and we wanted to eat some ramen~ We ended up in japantown after trying to go to another ramen shop and seeing a huge line... decided we didn't have the time and headed here because there are many many ramen places here. The only one we knew was already closed so we came to waraku because of the food reviews and because it was still pretty to, good sign, i thought.

We got the tonkotsu ramen ($10.99) with extra noodles on the side ($2), and a mini kakuni rice bowl ($4). The bowls look smaller than the regular one, But the quality is good, and I think quantity is enough too. There just probably won't be many leftovers to bring home. The ramen came with an egg, some thin pieces of meat, a mushroom type, ginger.. and the broth was less salty than average, which was good~~
The rice bowl had just 1 piece of meat, But it was a very big piece. The meat was very tasty, also sweet, and the rice was impregnated with the sauce, very yummy. Btw we ordered all without spring onions, but othrewise you'd have that too.
Service was quite attentive, some of the servers are Japanese and some others are not , But they're certainly trained to look japanese.
Good experience, would repeat<//review>< Pictures>

Black garlic ramen gets a stamp of approval from me. Broth is rice, noodles are plentiful, chashu is tasty, and comes with an egg! Probably the second best ramen in SF after Ippudo that you can actually eat without having to queue for ages if you come at the right time. (Having to queue half an hour before a place even opens as is the case with certain ramen places is not a good use of time, methinks...)</text>

Was lucky to come with a lot of people so we got to try a large assortment of food. Highly recommend the apps here esp the wings. The way they serve the gyoza is a spectacle, so fun. The ramen was really good too but I have to say the broth is extremely salty, but would def come again regardless. I'll prob share a bowl with extra noodles next time.</Text>

I was rather disappointed by Waraku. From the rather bland decor to unenthusiastic service to lackluster ramen.

I had their tsukemen, which is supposed to be a much heavier, richer broth than standard tonkatsu. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case at Waraku where the tsukemen was thin, and with exception of a heap of scallions, relatively light on flavor. Noodles were a bit unusual, coming with some kind of oil and seasoning on them. Temperature is a huge part of ramen, and Waraku fell short there, too, serving the tsukemen broth too hot which prevents it from sticking to the noodles, and serving an overcooked ajitama egg at refrigerated temperatures.

Drink options left much to be desired. There weren’t many great pairings with the food, and even the sake menu seemed content to put middling options on a pedestal.

One positive note: the chicken karaage, while far from traditional, was really delicious. I ordered the plate with rice, but I think the wait staff misheard me and I wound up with the protein-heavy version sans rice, but no complaints.</Text>

< Review>
Reliable ramen spot in J-town.

Ordered: Garlic Tonkotsu

Slices of garlic, black garlic oil and savory broth makes this perfect for a cold night. Soft boiled egg could have been softer for my taste, but the chasu didn't dissapoint. Substituted bamboo shoots for spinach at no additional cost.

It's a small space, so I wouldn't bring groups larger than 4. Tables of 2 are best.<//Review>

Good ambiance but my roasted garlic ramen was fine at best. Don't expect traditional ramen, very fusion.</review>

<text>Had to wait about 20min to get seated on a Sunday afternoon, and then it took another 20min by the time the food was served to us. So if you are in a hurry then this place might not be for you. Otherwise, I have no complaints- the ramen was amazing!! And the service was friendly and attentive.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Solid Ramen place. Noodles fall a little short for me, too firm, but I would return if in the area. The appetizers, service, and atmosphere were enjoyable. Food was good overall.

Good Japanese food. Not too expensive. Decor is great and the lighting isn't in your face. Its just right and its very easy for groups to come and eat at.< /Text>

<text>I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen, tako wasabi, and some karage at Waraku. The tako wasabi was pretty straightforward and good; plenty of wasabi and prepared well.
The karage came with a lemon wedge and some mayo based sauce to dip in. The seasoning was pretty light, but the breading was very crispy. Enjoyed it very much.
The ramen was decently spicy, noodles were pretty straightforward, not made in house. The broth was a bit light on flavor, which was slightly masked by the spicyness. They add cilantro to some of the ramen, which is a little odd, but not bad. The ajitamago (seasoned boiled egg) was well seasoned, but a bit more well done than I prefer. Overall, I enjoyed it. Not quite as good as Yamadaya or Marufuku, but nowhere near the wait time, sometimes convenience trumps all.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8IXxQdMTrxmTknxO4Nbu-kXpnF7oj9paznkPD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Good food, typically good service but tonight was awful.  Waited 15 minutes for my food after everyone else in my party had started eating.  Took 10 minutes to get someone's attention for the check.< /text>

I'm not an expert, but I think the ramen here is phenomenal.

The setting is very versatile - reasonable for a date or just hanging out with friends.  It's a comfortable vibe.

The prices are very reasonable, I think.<//Review>

The best Ramen I had in SF so far. This stacks up reasonably against a good shop in Tokyo. Broth and Noodles are just right, and that's not easy to do. The pork was incredibly tender.< /text>

We walked in around 7:30 on a Tuesday and were seated immediately, but by the time we were finished there was a line out the door. The food is definitely worth waiting for- the ramen was exceptionally flavorful and delicious. I especially recommend one of their "new" dishes, the spicy tan tan ramen- the spice level was probably just shy of medium, which made it very easy to appreciate the tastes of all of the other ingredients in the broth.</text>

Not bad. Ordered the spicy tan-tan ($14.50) and kaedama ($2). Noodles were a bit soft and overcooked, but the broth was good. I've never had cilantro in ramen before, but it worked well here.

If you're a garlic lover, you can crush as much as you'd like into your noodles.< /text>

Cute little hole-in-the-wall ramen joint in the thick of the Japanese district of SF... it’s menu stands out among the other ramen restaurants because of its simplicity. We tried the Spicy Tan-Tan and Roasted Garlic noodles, both unique yet simple.<//review>

Waraku is a special gem inside SF where you can find quality ramen and one of the best Sashimi Salads you’ll ever have. It’s appropriately priced, has excellent service, and the food is consistently outstanding. This is 100% a restaurant that I go to often, and a staple for when friends or family visit.</review>

Coming from my favorite ramen place in Vancouver being Marutama Ramen in the West End, this place was pretty good. Not sure if they make their noodles in house or not but Vancouver has spoiled me. The egg was okay but could use more marination and the yolk slightly harder with the gooey ness in the middle.< /review>

Black garlic ramen was delicious! Came in on a Sunday around 2pm and was seated right away. One of the only few ramen restaurant around Japan town that was open after 2pm.< /Review>

Very good ramen.

I devoured my chicken one quickly. My wife had the spicy one and she loved it.

The chicken karage is the best we've ever had.  Boneless, tender, perfectly fried (not oily).  Our son is a picky eater and he said it was the best chicken he's ever had.

They also have a pork belly rice dish which is perfect for non ramen fans and very reasonably priced.

A great casual option in Japan town.  Reviews said it fills up fast with wait times but we got in without a wait on a week night.<//text>

It's kinda interesting when you can squeeze fresh garlic into your broth. But if you order spicy seasoning for your broth, it becomes so salty.

Noodles are ok.</text>

We had pork belly kakuni, gyoza, tonkotsu ramen, roasted garlic tonkotsu ramen, and dan dan men. They’re all wonderful.  Tasty yet not too salty.  Soup with Great flavor.  NO MSG! It’s important to me, and almost impossible to find a ramen restaurant that does not use MSG in US.  Unexpectedly, dan dan men ended up being my favorite.  All of you must try it.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Gluten Free Noodles are a great option although if you need gluten free options for medical reasons you are limited to the vegetarian ramen selection. But it is BOMB!

Matcha Brûlée not really a brûlée it’s really more of a matcha custard with a light glaze.

Service subpar.</text><gmap_id>0x808580bed8e90009:0x4bfcacfeba03db0c</gmap_id><user_id>104644708713070089697</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Don’t believe the BS low ratings. Waraku Ramen is as legit as any authentic Japanese Ramen anywhere in the world. Umami for days & they’re happy to customize your order.

Every time I come back to SF I try a new Ramen spot, and none of them (so far) can hold a candle to Waraku</Review>

Great place for ramen basics. The tonkatsu and spicy tonkatsu ramen are must haves, with plenty of meat and very flavorful broth. Garlic lovers will also love this place, as they have whole garlic cloves on the table with a mincer.

Service is nice and quick with friendly wait staff. I come here at least once a week, and recommend this place to anyone that come to visit the city.<//Text>

< Review>
My youngest son turned me on to Waraku.
Told me it was "different" from our regular "ramen joint". We were first in at opening. The young lady that served us was very soft spoken so it was a lil difficult to understand her but her friendliness and level of "cuteness" made up for that.
Now listen... this is "different".
Their ramen is made with a "bone broth" that I imagine is cultivated the same as sourdough bread (Google the process)
It was DELICIOUS!
So delicious that I went in strictly as a spectator as my son was hungry and I was not...
I tasted his ramen (this is very telling as he is not one to share but it was so good and different from the norm that he WANTED me to taste it)...
I tasted his ramen and was so turned on by the bone broth flavor, I ordered one for myself purely for flavor and not for hunger.
Here's where it gets tricky...
One of the great challenges for any restaurant is consistency.
I failed to mention the ramen has a roasted garlic component. On My sons dish... it was PERFECT!
I guess they rushed mine as the garlic was just over the burn line. Instead of roasted, my garlic was burned. As much as I tried to muscle thru it as I didn't want a refire and really wanted to have the bone broth win the flavor battle... the burned garlic won. Shoulda sent it back. Ate half and took it home.
A lil water and soy sauce fixed it right up!
Meanwhile, their "MACHA FLAN (?)"?!
THA BOMB!!😲. NOT TOO "MACHAY" DIDN'T TASE LIKE I WAS EATING GRASS WHICH WAS MY FEAR WHEN I ORDERED IT. really, it rocked. Overall, something special here at WARAKU!!
Definitely going to give them a second try and would suggest it to anyone that asked.
That's why I took the time for this. That and hopefully the owners/cooks see this and balance the garlic roast a lil better cause if it wasn't for the overpowering effect of the burnt garlic... this would 5+ stars!
Give WARAKU a try.
Enjoy!

I would say this is the best bang for your buck ramen in Japan town. Hardly ever a wait, it’s heavy on the garlic too (a plus for me)<//Review>

I've only ever gotten the tonkotsu ramen, and that's all I've ever needed to get. The broth is so flavorful that I'll chug the whole bowl down. The pork was somehow so perfectly sweet and savory that is disheartened me to see it go. Not to mention that same flavor soaked into the all great soft boiled egg that goes into every bowl. If I'm in Japantown, this will be my go to for ramen until further notice.< /text>

<Review>Waraku used to be my absolute favorite ramen place in the city.  But lately I have been finding their fare inconsistent at best.  Don't get me wrong, it is still better than most.  The smoked eggs have come out practically hard boiled the last few times, rather than the runny yolk that everybody wants.  They also seem to be very affected by how busy they are.  Best case, go here on a "school night" when restaurants are supposed to be slow.  The broth will be much better than average, the noodles with that great QQ taste, and if you happen in on a good night, 3/4 of the meat will be great.  If it's a Friday or Saturday night, save yourself the time and go get a burrito or something.< /Review>< date>

The Tonkotsu Ramen Deluxe was very creamy and delicious. Probably the best ramen I've ever had! Perfect with warm sake and the seaweed salad. The food came out very quickly. The waitresses were kind though not very attentive. I'd been meaning to go to this place for a while but always worried about a long line. I think we got lucky; we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table of four at 8pm on a Friday.< /Review>

<Text>I've had all the different ramen from here and the black garlic one was the only one that I felt was underwhelming. My go to order is the spicy tonkotsu ramen with kakuni instead of chashu. They have fresh garlic and garlic presses on each table as well as chili oil and other condiments so you can tweak the taste to your liking. The ramen noodles are nice and chewy. The takoyaki is okay, but nothing to write home about.<//Text>< pics>

Right at the edge of J-Town, one might be weary to go to the first Ramen place they see. This one however, is a good bet, and the ramen is wonderful.

They allow for quite a bit of customization with your meal, and it makes it an enjoyable experience. Definitely a must try!< /text>

Pretty good ramen in a very modern environment.

I got the standard tonkotsu ramen, which came out very fast. The broth was very thick and rich and the noodles were decent. I think a higher broth to noodle ratio would have made it a bit better.

I can't say I'm a fan of the pork belly though. The fatty part had no bite to it and the meat part tasteless and a bit dry.</review>

I ordered the Delux Tonkatau.

The good:
The noodles and pork were cooked to perfection.

The bad:
The broth, on the other hand, lacked flavor was bordering on sweet.
The egg was a hard boiled egg.

I would like to go back and try the broth with spicy miso to make my final decision.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I've lived in Japan for three years and after moving back to the states I had yet to find an authentic Japanese restaurant....let alone one that had a perfect bowl of Ramen. If you're looking for an authentic Ramen experience....Waraku will not disappoint. The broth....The thickness of the noodles...the additions on the top are all on point, leaving you dully satisfied but leaving just enough room to try their green tea creme brulee...which is also as amazing as it sounds!

Tonkotsu ramen and spicy tan-tan noodles were delicious!  Service excellent, reasonable price, nice atmosphere! Definitely my new favorite ramen place in SF.  Only thing to know is that the seaweed salad is really more of a green leafy salad, it had only a very very small amount of seaweed.</text>

<review>The spicy tan-tan ramen was nice. It had a nice kick to it and the ramen was good. I need to try the other menu items to see how the ramen is. It's not the best ramen place I've been to and many locals seem to agree there are some better options out there.

However not all may have the same dishes available at the same time.</review>< pictures>

I enjoyed the tonkotsu but they only serve pork in the ramen. My husband has an aversion to pork and there were no chicken ramen bowls.Then we asked for a coke. They charged a $2.50 for each can of coke.< /text>

Tonkatsu ramen is great, the broth is perfect. Not too salty, but very flavorful.

Gyoza are good here as well.</Review>

The wait for a 4 person table took a while, and the place was pretty loud. However, the ramen was good. I had the tonkotsu. The broth is really good and the noodles are cooked just right. The pork is a bit sweet and fatty for my liking. The smoked egg is pretty interesting. They forgot to add the sweet corn I ordered, but they brought out a small dish when I mentioned it. We shared a few other dishes as well: seaweed salad, agedashi tofu and spicy noodle spring rolls. None of the appetizers were as good as the ramen.</review>

I ordered the tsukemen and wow. It was so bad. They had coated the noodles in a sweet bonito based coating and it was really bad. I didn't eat the rest of it, finished my entrees which were good but didn't redeem how bad the noodles were. I paid my bill and left.< /Review>< pics>

The food is good too :) came in close to closing, greeted by friendly (seems like family run?) staff, ordered a non meat ramen, and wished that I didn't ( it WAS good, but I'm not big on the fish flavour... I try to get into it, but my taste buds have never fully accepted it. I hope it's an aquire taste lol)

I tried the meat version and it's great. Salad, Miso etc etc etc are all great.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Ordered the shoyu ramen which tasted quite bland but had thick noodles that were cooked a perfect al dente. I was disappointed that the egg came hard boiled though, which was unappetizing. Definitely was not a bowl of ramen that I could not finish.
The takoyaki on their menu was delicious, but I would not come back for an appetizer.< /Text>

They specialize on japanese ramen but I do not see any difference with other noodle shop.

I was surprised that they were highly recommended on this part of Japanese town. Or probably I have expected too much. Very expensive nagiri but excellent service though.</review>

<review>We decided to try the new ramen restaurant.

The noodle broth was cooked for more than 12 hours. It has a lot of rich flavors. The noodle was done right, not too soggy. Priced reasonably which is similar to other restaurants in Japantown.

I also love the sashimi salad. It's a big bowl of yummy salad and fresh fish. So worth it for less than $10 I think.

I'm excited about the new ramen place in the neighborhood.</review><rate>5<//rate><Time>1391921686280< /Time>< response>

<review>The best ramen spots in Japantown in my opinion. Come early on the weekends because there will be a line(they don't take reservation). But you'll probably be safe to get a table if you come on a weekday. Smoked eggs, fresh garlic and pork belly goodness.

Protip: for some odd reason they don't advertise this on the menus inside but it is listed on the menu they leave out front but get the "Deluxe Ramen" that comes with everything< /review>< pics>

I got the tonkotsu broth ramen (there are only 3 choices). The broth was decent, but not as thick as it should be. The noodles were average, nothing to rave about there. Chashu, good, not amazing.

What made this meal so awesome? THE PORK BELLY. Definitely get that. You'll wish you got two orders of it.</text>< Resp>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Walked in and signed up on waiting list. The list clearly states their non-forgiving policy. However, other groups who signed up after us were seated before us (our entire party was there).

Our party of three was crammed into a table meant for two.

Additionally, someone who was seated after us got his food before we even ordered.

Ordered edamame and sashimi as an appetizer-- however they had run out of edamame. How can an Asian restaurant run out of edamame?!?

Our three meals came one at a time and the appetizers last. Salmon sashimi was also pretty terrible.

All of this and they were NOT extremely busy.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>My favorite place to get ramen in Japan town. One of my favorite things about the ramen here is the broth, which has a nice smokey flavor, which gives it a bit more of an edge compared to the other ramen places I've been.  Come here with some friends and grab some kaarage, sake, and a pitcher of Sapporo and you'll have a great time.</Review>< Pictures>

Well y'all.
I've found my favorite ramen in the Bay (for now).

The ramen is AMAZE but their other food items were also all REALLY good which I didn't expect of a ramen-specific place.

Worth the wait (if there is one). Get the tonkotsu ramen, $9 - the broth is rich and borderline creamy, even. The mouthfeel and taste is a must-try and the noodles are perfect. Comes with fresh garlic - ask for a garlic press!

We also tried:
Sashimi salad - which is HUGE for $9 and totally a steal
Tako (octopus) wasabi & ika shio kara (salted squid), $3 each - portion was small but so fresh -- interesting and concentrated flavors
Agedashi tofu $5 - HOLY - yes plz
Takoyaki $4.5 - ON POINT

DEFINITELY RETURNING AND RECOMMENDING.
Oh yes, the interior is beautiful and upscale. But I'm hurr to eat.</text>

<Text>I came here for lunch with my girlfriend and cousin and ordered the Deluxe Tonkotsu Ramen. This ramen place is probably my favorite in San Francisco right now because of all the ingredients they put into the ramen, the service, and the decorations in the restaurant. The noodles were delicious and had a nice chew to them. The broth was very flavorful and rich. We also asked for garlic and they gave us a garlic press.I liked how you could press your own fresh garlic cloves. The chashu was tender but the pork belly wasn't as good as the chashu. I liked that this ramen came with corn because my girlfriend's favorite food is corn and probably made this place one of our favorites. The egg was runny just the way I like it but everyone else at my table had an overcooked egg. Sucks for them =P. I'll probably come back often to eat the Deluxe Tonkotsu Ramen.</Text>< Pics>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>Came here for lunch during the J-pop festival. It was a really nice and well decorated place. Service was good and fast.

I had the deluxe tonkotsu ramen with the spicy miso paste (not spicy at all). The broth was very savory and flavorful. The pork was soft and tender. The EGG had tons of flavor which was a good surprise. Overall pretttttttttttty good ramen. I'd give it 4 stars but I feel they messed up on one of the key components - the noodles. My noodles were under cooked and were too chewy for my liking. The portions were also too small for the price. 13$ and I was hungry 10 minutes after eating. I feel like noodles are cheap, just throw a bunch in there to fill us up.

I'd come back again to give it another shot, especially cause there aren't too many great ramen places in the city (or have yet to find).

Must haves:

It's not pricey and the noodles are fab. The broth is good too. I suggest the Tonkotsu with Spicy Miso add on. The Ika shio kara (marinated salted squid) was unique. I wouldn't have ordered that on my own, but my friend got it and it was tasty.<//review>< pictures>

New favorite ramen place in SF! I still can't compare it to Ramen Dojo in San Mateo, but i still love this place!

There's garlic cloves on the table, and if there isn't a garlic press on table, ASK FOR ONE! About one clove of garlic really enhances the flavor of the ramen.

I wasn't a huge fan of the tsukemen but it seems to be a popular item on the menu.

Dinner menu has a few extra things on it compared to the lunch menu.  Chicken karaage, gyoza, and kobe beef are delicious too.<//Text>

Love the decor, very soothing and relaxing, they kept much of the same ambiance as before (minus the large communal table), and the service is prompt and friendly. The focus is ramen, so if you don't like ramen noodles, you might not find much else to satisfy your hunger here, however it does offer some other interesting appetizers and side dishes. I always prefer the Shoyu (chicken-based broth) Ramen, and the Gyoza appetizer has yet to disappoint!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>(Translated by Google) In fact, I want to give it a three-star and a half. The environment and service are not bad. I ordered the second noodle on the menu and then upgraded. The soup was not bad. The egg was tender but sweet. The meat was also sweet. The octopus balls were crunchy and felt like Okonomiyaki. Hahaha, the sauce is a bit salty

(Original)
其实想给三星半，环境和服务还不错，点了菜单的第二个面然后upgrade，汤还不错，蛋嫩嫩的但是好甜，肉也是偏甜，章鱼小丸子脆脆的感觉像大阪烧哈哈哈，酱有点咸< /review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) It was surprisingly unknown to many people by WARAKU that myself heard the name of the shop I heard for the first time, so I thought what it was like to eat before, but when I try it it is very delicious and even if I have more rows I thought that it might be good.

(Original)
意外と多くの人に知られていないのがWARAKUで僕自身も初めて聞くお店の名前でしたので食べる前はどうかなと思いましたが、食べてみると非常に美味しくてもっと行列が出来ても良いんじゃないかと思うくらいでした。<//text>
