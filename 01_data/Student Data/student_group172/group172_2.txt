It was our first time eating there, we ordered Pad thai with rice and yellow chicken curry delicious!! The noodles were not that spicy but they give you a little hot sauce on the side if you want to make it spicier.  And service was great, too.<//text>

Last night, my daughter graduated 8th grade and all she wanted was her favorite food from Phuket Thai.  We've been going there for years and they have the best chicken skewers and soup ever.  I had the shrimp and mushroom diner and it was delicious.  Also, the have fantastic yummy rice that is not just your regular white rice.  It is made with care and tastes amazing.  Love it.  My daughter also got a chocolate raspberry cake (not from Phuket) to go along with the yummy food.  All in all, she had a very enjoyable dinner and a great graduation (even with all the Covid stuff going on in the world).< /Review>

< Review>
Bad experience!I normally prefer Thai rama because  of NO delivery option until 5:45pm at thai rama i went with phuket thai..I ordered Fried rice and pad kee mao. Normally for fried rice ,the rice they use is jasmine.But here in phuket thai it’s some kind of long grain rice and it’s super dry no flavor at all.I felt like I’m eating dry rice and chicken with out seasoning and pad kee mao is having some butter taste don’t know what they used .what I don’t understand is how they are getting these many good reviews(might be people who haven’t tried other Thai restaurants).I’m definitely not going to order hear again.</Review>

Delicious Thai food!! Have ordered delivery twice recently - every dish was hot & fresh & wonderful, including: Angel wings, green curry chicken, Phad Kee Mao Kai, Spicy Catfish Curry, lunch special King Pao Chicken, sweet sticky rice.  Lunch specials are a great deal that includes soup or salad & rice!  We received Mango Sticky Rice on the House with order today!! Order was delivered earlier than promised! Love this restaurant!!</text>

Curry doesn’t come with rice! We ordered through Door Dash. Why would they send 4 curries, with NO white rice? When I called the restaurant, they said it doesn’t come with it. Would have been good to know that before ordering and getting it delivered. Had to make our own rice, so the food was cold by the time our rice was made. Taste was decent, but not amazing.</Review>

.I ordered Mongolian Beef.  Very little beef a lot of mushrooms and a big pile of chopped Romain lettuce to.fill up the bowl.  The fish was over cooked.
Appetizers Spring Rolls and Fried Shrimp we’re very good.  Food was tasty, presentation was poor.<//review>

<text>The food was excellent. We were told our delivery (free delivery) would take about 50min. It showed up in 25min. The guy was friendly enough. I'd heard good things, but was trying not to have expectations. The food really delivered. We had a great Yellow Curry, some Basil Chicken and excellent Tom Yum Kai soup. I'll look forward to trying more from their very extensive menu. We've been regulars of another Thai place in the south bay for a while, and will probably still order from there, but Phuket Thai has definitely made it into the rotation.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Dishes are more traditional Thai than US Thai you find around the area. A little different but okay. Food dishes come to the table as they are done one at a time. You may wish to ask them to bring them all at once. Parking in the rear is available.<//Text>< Pictures>

Food is good, but the service is terrible.  Have been going here just because the food is good, but the service is as if they feel that we are annoying them and that they are doing us a favor.  My orders have been incorrect (take out) the last umpteen times, and if I call they tell me I can drive back to fix it.  The service will close this place eventually.< /Text>

<review>Impress your friends without going broke. Ive eaten at many nice Thai restaurants, even Vegetarian Thai. This was wonderful! Good size portions, but not obnoxious. (I had left over) The Spring rolls were fresh and presented like a carefully wrapped  gift. Not tossed on a bare plate. The chicken coconut soup was perfect. Lemongrass gave that needed tart that you seek in this creamy dish. I was able to order my soup "small" delightful! I almost didn't order it till I saw I had that choice. Thai ice tea was delicate and not too sweet! I watched the Sun go down and view was very relaxing. Wait staff was courteous and attentive. Quick, clean, classic. Nice wine menu as well. Worth a try, I dont think you'll regret it. Lunch specials looked like a value. No dress code but you may feel like its leave the muscle shirt at home. I tipped a deserved 20% Thank you for being so good!<//review>< pics>

The food here is just so tasty. It’s familiar like all Thai restaurants but everything from the curry to the noodles to the best Mee Krob appetizer is just that pinch better than anywhere else.

It’s great for LARGE parties — like 12+. They can put almost all their tables together for you and they will.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>My family and I wanted to try a new Thai food place and saw this place had good yelp reviews. Overall it was pretty tasty, but I've had better. I had the Pad Se Ew with braised tofu and it was good but didn't have too much sauce and the tofu was a bit soggy. My husband got the Pad Thai and ordered it as spicy as they would allow and he was not impressed with the heat level. We got our order to go and on our way home they called me to tell me they had forgotten to put our order of fried egg rolls in our bag. They said they would drive it out to us so we didn't have to drive back and it took them over 20 minutes to go the 2 miles, which was a bit excessive. While it was a nice gesture we were practically done with our meal by the time they arrived.<//text>< pics>

Stank face!
That is the faces that looked at me and my family when we walked in the door 30 minutes before closing.
We have been there before and it was good but something has changed.
The bad vibes that made us feel uncomfortable were annoying. The was was not good anymore and for this the tip was zero. And I always tip<//review>

Thus spot had been here for a long time so they must be doing something right. The basil chicken is to die for with just the right amount of spice. Although they are a little understaffed they still get the job done.< /text>

We are vegetarians and they understand that will so it's a plus.
We ordereed:
Tom yum soup - it was tasty but small quantity for $11, And not served in a hot pot.

Basil fried rice - Rice was not cooked. There was no flavor and it tasted dry. We had asked for tofu but it wasnt in it so we had to send it back.

Green curry - I had asked for spicy but it wasn't spicy at all. It was mild at best.

Pad kee maw -  our son liked it.< /Text>< Rate>

First I have to say I love their Red Curry, but after my last 2 experiences there I can no longer give them my service. Twice I've ordered take out and they have forgotten key ingredients, like the vegetables or bamoo. Then I ordered take out that had a long black hair, gross, I called and they said I could get the meal again for free.
When I went to claim this free meal they changed me $2 for the rice, super lame! Then when I got this home it was missing bamoo! When your Red Curry consists of chicken and bamboo that sucks. I called and they said since it was a free meal they couldn't do anything for me, except give me extra bamboo the next time (how does that help my current meal?!?) When I told the guy that wasn't acceptable he hung up on me, WTH!
The following week I tried calling 4 different times to talk to a manager, but each time I was told the manager or owner would be in later that day or "they only come in on the weekends" each time I called I could never get them to let me talk to someone in charge.
Sadly, I won't be eating their Red Curry again<//Text>

Expensive and food is just OK. The spring rolls are notttt worth it at all and the soup serving sizes are so small. The menu says 4 pieces for the spring rolls which to me meant four rolls. Nope, it's two cut in half. The rice lacks flavor. Won't return.</text>

<review>It took awhile for the hostess to take our lunch time to-go order.  Once it was ready, she dropped the bag in front of us and tore off the receipt without a word.  Later, while eating at home, I noticed a ladybug walking around my salad, hence the restaurant's B rating perhaps?
This was this restaurants second chance after previously giving our phone order to another customer and making us wait while they remade our order.< /review><Rate>1< /Rate><userid>111833382216722033074</userid><resp>None</resp>< Time>

Why no rice? That's really frustrating especially when they ask "do you want rice with that?" Of course I want rice with my curry. Their curries and most other dishes don't come with rice; they charge extra for it.< /Text>

Probably THE BEST Carnitas in La Habra.L!!!
You can also buy cooked side dishes in bulk - beans, tortillas, ALL Mexican food - and it’s FANTASTIC!!’
Even before COVID, it was the best carry-out in La Habra.   Everything on the menu is 5 star restaurant-grade!
GREAT for a picnic, or party!< /Text>

The service was absolutely great from my entrance to the end of my meal. I got the carne asada burrito mojado. It was very tasty and had a good kick of spice with it. I would have liked rice in the burrito, but it was fine because I was still stuffed with what I got. I checked in on Yelp and got also a free drink with my meal. I got the strawberry drink which was good. The other option was a tamarind drink.

They also have $1 tacos (with the purchase of a drink) on Tuesdays. I'll have to come back for that!<//text>

<Text>My review is based on delivery. I’ve never been to this restaurant but decided on ordering  it based on the overall reviews.

That said will start with the positives.
Ordered:
Fresh tortilla chips they were fine, tasted great and fresh.
Side of beans they also tasted fine.
Green & Red salsas were good.

Now the negatives
Ordered:
Menudo the meat was extremely slimy. If I would’ve been at this restaurant I would’ve definitely returned it.  I used the option to add extra hominy and in my opinion it was like a normal amount so if you order this without adding extra hominy be prepared to have a very low amount of hominy.

Shrimp burrito. I was really expecting this to be good and full of flavor and it was totally the opposite. Very, very bland, the rice in burrito was OK, it had a bunch of shredded cabbage and possibly maybe 4 small shrimp that were cut up and spread throughout the burrito. The shrimps themselves on a scale of 1 to 10 had a flavor strength of about a 4, you mostly taste rice and cabbage with every bite.

These were the main courses that were ordered and they were totally unsatisfactory that is the reason for the two star rating the reason why it got a two star rating and not a one star was because the sides were good.

I would definitely not order=delivery  from them again if I was going to try this place again it would have to be in person that way if it’s the same type of food in person I can return it easily & get my money back because that’s how bad main course items were.</Text><rating>2<//rating>< Gmap_id>

I simply like their dishes. I always get fantastic customer service there. The place is clean and the staff members are always very friendly. Will come visit again.</review>

<text>Went one night it was good. Went back and the tamales were dry and I didn't get what I paid for. I asked for 4 tamales and got 3. I even asked are there 4 in there she said yes. Got home only 3 and they were dry and tasteless that was in the morning you would think that they would be Fresh in the morning. Don't know if I will be back or not.< /text><userid>112739437522335212298< /userid>< name>

Lady is nice, food is o.k. 🤷🏼‍♂️ and the price is high for what it is. The menu prices are around 30% higher than what is currently posted on here.<//review>

Best Mexican food I've had in Orange County. The service is warm and friendly, you feel like family. The food is amazing, you can tell the tortillas are made fresh at the restaurant and all of the dishes are seasoned to perfection. The El Pastor is especially good. The Chile Verde is the best I've ever had and the soups are the most authentic you can get in the US. The beans are the best beans you will ever eat. I cannot reccomend this place highly enough!<//review>

I consider this place a real find. Delicious Mexican food, low prices, and various tamales choices on the menu (love tamales). They have the standard taco and burrito choices but well made too. Sopes,  tortas, quesadillas, and seafood items are also on the menu but I haven't gotten to them yet. The interior is small, but is a nice, pleasant place to dine. The staff seem to be genuinely pleasant and helpful.</review>

So, this place is ok. I decided to write a review to hopefully help someone look for some good Mexican food. In my opinion you won’t find it here. I am sitting here in the restaurant disappointed trying to eat their advertised Cuban Torta, I probably won’t be finishing it. The salsa with the chips is watered down, torta is missing key ingredients that make it a Torta Cubana. :(
I’ve been here before for tacos, they were good. (Very hard to mess those up)
Young lady serving was very nice, Mexican Coke was delicious.< /review>

Went for a Chile Relleno and no tortillas were given to me also the sauce was sooo salty couldn't even eat it.  The rice was gross and it had stocky old cheese on the Chile Relleno.  DO NOT GO EAT THERE. 😡😡😰<//text>

Food is good. But what's the bad part is NOT TO EXPECT THEM TO BE OPEN as the hours that are listed.   It says closes at 930 But THEY WERE ALREADY CLOSED BY 845 . so I called them and asked "what time do u close?". Their response was "we already closed" I said "ok, so what time do u close at?" She says "9" I then said "it's not even 9 yet" I was mad cuz I drove from 20 min away. I even double checked the hours before I went. In my opinion that's not how a business so be ran. If they wanna close early then change the hours and list it.  Not when you just feel like leaving early !</review>

I've made menudo for over 25 years and have continued to look for some good menudo  for years. Well guess what, the menudo here is as good as it gets. I'll be back as I have just move into the area.  I have to try some of the other items on the menu. Prices look very decent.<//text>

<text>On my experience this placewas not good. Their not clean or friendly. The restrooms are not clean. People that go there might be from around and there probably use to that. I ask for enchiladas told them i was alergic to some food and not to put it. Well the lady didnt care brought me the food late. I then look at her an said it was not what i ask n that she should make me a new order. Well they didnt they just got the enchiladas and put them on a new plate n took it back i ended up in the hospital that day. Please if someone says their alergic to something belive them dont think their joking thats not up to them to decide. And you can bearly communicate with them they bearly speak english.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>The food is good but for some reason everytime I order something to go they always end up messing on my order. Therefore I always end up eating something that I did not order.

<review>I actually used Yelp to find this place because I was craving some birria tacos.  This place was an unsuspecting diamond in the rough.  It's a cozy space located in a little strip mall off La Habra blvd.  And if you don't pay attention you might miss it.

First off the service was excellent.  We came in with a party of 7, but there was only one table big enough to fit us with the reserved sign on it. When we inquired about the tables, the response was, "we saved if for you".

Secondly, all the food looked amazing.  The carne asada was juicy and not dry, the chicken was moist, the shrimp was perfectly cooked. Birria tacos were a little bit on the dry side, but very edible and still yummy. All the veggies were fresh. Salsa's were made fresh with red and green variety.  Best part, portions were big and definitely worth the prices.

Tacos were $1.65 each, but they were stuffed with $1.65 worth of meat and veggies.  Super Nacho's were $11.99, but came with chicken, carve asada, big juicy shrimp, guacamole, and fresh air cream all over to fresh cooked tostada chips.  Quesadillas overfilled with cheese and meat.

Once finished our server was nice enough to split the checks 7 ways! If I'm in the area again, this is the place I'll be coming to get my Mexican food fix.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I worked with these guys on a recent DIY front yard project that required 2 cubic yards of decomposed granite and they were FANTASTIC. Prices were the same or better than others, and SWB&S had more delivery options and could accommodate the access challenges in my urban North Park neighborhood. Everyone I spoke with, from asking questions to placing the order to the delivery people — everyone was friendly, courteous and provided top-notch service. This will be my go-to source for future projects.< /Text>

This is the best customer service if you want to dig for your stones. They are kind, helpful, and most importantly they let you look for want you need and then take it to your car. It’s a small location but of all locations most accommodating.</text>

I own a landscape design and contracting firm and I have to say that the people at this company are incredible. As a female in this business, I've found it can be a very unfriendly business and your team at the Pacific Beach location has always made me feel so welcome.  James, Illusion, and Shauna are an incredible team at the front, and Matt and Lalo have been the most killer yard crew I have worked with.  I have to write a special shout out to James. I am going to miss this kid at the front so much!  There is nothing better than coming into your PB Store during a stressful day and James has a huge smile on his face.  I have worked with James for years and you can tell that he genuinely cares about people and making customers happy.  Talk about going above and beyond, any time I call, I get a call back from James once things have calmed down to see what I need.  I have never encountered service like this.  I honestly will say, I really have never met anyone in my field as nice as James and the rest of your team in PB.  Illusions leadership and sense of humor are contagious.  Shauna you are the sweetest and calmest person I know, and I know how crazy it gets in there!  Matt, you always seemed to have eyes in the back of your head and knew what what was going on and needed to be done, a contractors dream!   Lalo, always hustling out there!  Your team, their chemistry and work ethic have made Southwest my #1 pick since I started my business.  I can't recommend this team enough.  I hope y'all carry on the legacy.< /text>

The staff at this location have excellent customer service!
Each interaction (phone calls & in-person) was pleasant and with the kind of people I like to do business with.  There was even a mixup on my purchase- when I arrived home I realized they loaded the incorrect size of stones purchased.  Although it did cause inconvenience for me, the staff politely made it right with a great sense of urgency & care.  They completely fixed the problem & my inconvenience - Shawna, Tiana, manager Mike, and others were super friendly & helpful.  I'll definitely go back to this location for future project needs!!</Text>

Unexpectedly helpful, friendly, and efficient.  I called Southwest after having a hard time trying to buy just a small amount of travertine coping and pavers at another materials supplier.  Shawna answered my questions right away, and helped me find samples and then placed the order for me.  If you are a home owner needing materials for a small job, or a large job, this is the place to go!<//text>

I love this place!  I've been to this location several times and always get great, friendly service but this weekend topped the others. I decided to install some synthetic turf in my back yard and do it myself. I've had a couple material deliveries from Southwest (delivered the day and time promised) and on Saturday I was finalizing the top layer of decomposed granite before laying the turf.
Well, I realized I was about two yards short and headed to SW Boulder. My truck can handle 1/2 yard at-a-time, so I was hurrying. They were quick and efficient each time but my last trip was going to have me arrive a couple minutes after closing.
I called to see if they could help and the manager, Christian, said "come on down and I'll help you out".  I was so stoked to have that kind of service in today's world.
With the new world of Amazon instant delivery and so many stores closing, I want to make sure we'll run, customer oriented businesses like Southwest remain open.
This place is the top of my recommendation list.<//Text>

I strongly disagree with MC. I use Southwest pretty often, and I am always impressed. They have very good customer service and an amazing selection. Make sure you go up to their big yard in Rainbow if you want to see all of your choices, though. The PB yard is just a small selection of what they can get for you. I love picking boulders from them because they have about 20 different kinds, way more than anyone else, and they let you climb all over the piles and pick any specific boulder you want. They also have a big display garden area with a huge pond, worth seeing. You'll get some good ideas to take home with you from it. These guys function like a family owned business (which I think they are) and really go the extra mile.< /text>

Dont know if this place is under new management since re-opening the PB location but quality of service has gone way down since the re opening. Went there today and the sold me 300 lbs of crushed granite when I got home it felt light and small so I weighed it 240 lbs. When I called to see if I could pick up remaking 60 lbs they told me they sell by volume....  I've spent thousands of dollars here over the years. And they would rather lose a customer than fill up a 60 lb bag of material. Their never getting my business again!< /Text>

I don't mind paying a little more to not have to drive for an hour or two.

The products they have (and can get you) are nice.

The sales people and staff are very nice and knowledgeable.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Only interested in maximum profit, no real care to home customers.  Lousy attitude from the yard workers to the counter staff.  I need 1 ton of flagstone, and chose the $800/ton Autumn Flame select.  Nice looking stuff.  The pallets ready to ship are 2 tons, and the pick your own had 5 pieces in it, 2 of which were definitely not select.  Asked to get a new pallet to choose from and "Oh we can't we'd have to break down the pallet and then we have a ton left over".  So you're not going to take an $800 sale so you can get $1600?  GFY.  Good For You.  You lost my business and anyone else that cares about just good business for good people.  Shame on these guys. Especially the effort to break down a pallet when the 3 yard workers were gazing longingly at their rocks and DG.  So SORRY to make them work!  GFY.< /Review>

<time>1387665323245<//time><rate>5<//rate><Text>I thought everyone at SWB was very professional and helpful, from the sales staff to the guys out in the yard.  They helped us find the best pieces for our project, stacked them onto a pallet, and did a great job loading. The sales staff explained their pricing which I thought was competitive. Of course if you are buying small amounts, eg. DG and they have to measure on demand, you will pay a premium, but that's the nature of buying in 50 lb bags  versus bulk.< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
Drew was on time at 7:00 am for 6 dog appointments.  She was efficient and the dogs look great!  I have very nervous dogs and each one has a different issue.  One with a back issue, one with high anxiety and the little one was tangled.  Drew did a wonderful job and we are very appreciative.  She also had a package for our 3 Chihuahuas pups that was affordable.  She believes in building relationships with the dogs and making it a stress free experience for mom and pups.  Thank you Drew!<//review>

Way over due..... Paulette came to our house over the summer. She's amazing with the cat & 2 dogs. Great personality and her love for pets shines thru her work. My female pup is usually  pretty shy but took to Paulette immediately. Prices are reasonable and scheduling is pretty easy. Thank you.< /Text><Time>1613572457316< /Time>< rating>

Drew was phenomenal with the girlz, they have had less than stellar grooming experiences and so we have had them go without for a while.  Did not want to add stress to their lives, but after their initial concerns of this is happening again, they were very happy.  They are strutting around like peacocks now with their fluffy shiny hair and we are so glad not to have to worry about keeping them groomed now.  Drew won them over!  Great worker and fab personality.</text>

Amy is WONDERFUL! My Sophie looks and feels like a million bucks. You should see her strutting around the neighborhood. Amy is attentive, caring, and detail oriented. I never thought I would find a groomer like the one we left when I moved. I am happy to say, I was wrong! I am booked into the new year.</review>

<Review>Shannelle is so sweet and did an amazing job! Our 5 month old English Bulldog, Chloe, loves her. This was her first time getting groomed. She got spayed last month and couldn’t get wet for 2 weeks, so she was DIRTY. The added convenience of them coming to you is awesome and would be great if your pup doesn’t do well on car rides. We will 100% be using Pawgo and Shanelle again and highly recommend them for your fur babies, too!< /Review></record>

Kristie was amazing.  Usually when I get Chyna groomed, I always get her back with her breathing very heavily.  This time she came back breathing normal.  I am not sure what she did different,  but this was a plus for me.  Thank you so much Kristie you are amazing.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Our miniature  Australian Labredoodle got his first real hair cut yesterday. He is 6 months old. He was scheduled for Tuesday but his scheduled groomer got sick. Bennie is getting fixed on Monday and his hair was way too long. We are so grateful Shaunte worked him into her schedule! She did a fabulous job. We will be using her again. It is so convenient to have your doggie groomed at home.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmoeewY6Szkw4LM1tIMN13cW8qNNH_6rUkMmjE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTPzlPoThtcJ5dJkdsvP2xFHK-S2LCUvfL_uLv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

Our pup is so happy, we have used nikki at pawgo for 3 groomings. It is so great! No waiting in a kennel getting all worked up. He's in and done in about an hour. I don't know how she does it, he looks and feels amazing.< /review>

I was impressed with Jordyn as soon as my little dog ran right up to her and Jordyn is a true dog person because she talked sweet to Marshmallow ( my dog) the same way I do when I see Marshmallow’s friends. This is my 1st time trying a mobile groomer. So my Marshmallow didn’t understand why I was leaving and she was going into a van to get groomer. Jordyn was letting marshmallow know she can go into the van and when she was not understanding what was happening. Jordyn picked her up ( I was just going to say she’s not going in by herself ,Jordyn did what I would of and picked her up)and talked to her to reinsure her it’s ok. When the hair cut ect. Was done and marshmallow meet us she was sooo happy and looked so cute. The spa day was a hit!!! I booked Jordyn for the rest of the year because I wanted my baby to go to Jordyn every month and get her spa day. One more thing I loved how Jordyn talked to us for awhile before she took marshmallow in for her hair cut ect. Gave time for us to get to know her as well as marshmallow. And she talked to us after to make sure we liked her cut. Which we did!! I’m so happy I called Pawgo and it’s worked out fantastic 😀

We have used Lisa O. 4 times now for our Shih Tsu puppy Digger...he looks absolutely adorable and you can tell she is gentle because he is excited to see her every time. It doesn't get any more convenient than your own driveway, and the pricing is about the same as most good groomers.
...Update February 2020 - Lisa just finished another amazing transformation, Digger loves her and loves to strut his stuff when she's done! I added a couple photos this time...before & after<//Text>

<review>Athena did a great job with our 85lb Golden Retriever puppy. It was his first haircut and we had him shaved. He is full of energy, but she hung in there and got the job done.

Shanelle Aguilar accused me of not taking care of my dog and insisted she shaved my dog down on the last visit.   When I told her I had proof she didn’t shave my dog down she did NOT believe me.  I have photos and videos of how she verbally attacked me as well as photos from the previous grooming service and I will submit this to her corporate office and file a formal complaint. She clearly had the wrong dog in mind and was very unprofessional. I would certainly NOT recommend this groomer ever.  Her job is to groom dogs not to reprimand or be rude to the owners.  We lost my mother in law 2 days ago and my husband advised her not to speak to me on this manner and she persisted!  She lacks empathy, professionalism and customer service.<//Review>

<review>To be completely honest,  I will never go to another brick and mortar groomer again. I can t believe how well Pawgo treated my dog, she is typically freaked out by grooming...not this time. Kristie did a great job, I highly recommend her. Ask for Kristie.<//review>< date>

We had a great experience with Pawgo mobile groomer.  The groomer for our cat was Shaunte and she did an excellent job!  She was friendly, showed great customer service, and our cat was calm during the whole process and looked great with his new lion cut when done.  Shaunte was wonderful!</Review>

<review>Ivy just finished with my mini-long haired doxie, Casey, I have her trimmed to a smooth coat in the summer.  Casey has a few issues, she has a lot of warts on her little body, she has also had two back surgery's, so great care has to be taken when trimming her.  Ivy did a great job, Casey looks great and she came into the house her happy little self.  The company itself was so great about finding a schedule that we could work with.  I've used them when they went by another name and will continue with them now.< /review>< pictures>

Our miniature  Australian Labredoodle got his first real hair cut yesterday. He is 6 months old. He was scheduled for Tuesday but his scheduled groomer got sick. Bennie is getting fixed on Monday and his hair was way too long. We are so grateful Shaunte worked him into her schedule! She did a fabulous job. We will be using her again. It is so convenient to have your doggie groomed at home.< /Text>

My furbaby was seen this morning by Jordyn N. What an AMAZING JOB she did!!! We almost didn’t recognize the new dog that came back from his groomer! I can be pretty picky as well but Jordyn knocked it right out the park! We couldn’t be more pleased! I like that the prices include everything such as teeth brushing and ear cleaning. This was always an “add-on” at previous places. From COVID guidelines to follow up instructions, Jordyn covered it all!! Thanks Jordyn for introducing us to PawGo- Silas WILL be seeing you again. And again...and again... we are now forever Paw-Go customers 😁</Text>

< Review>
My girlfriend and I scheduled a grooming appointment for our dog with Pawgo. The appointment was scheduled for this morning, with the groomer Paulette scheduled to arrive some time between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m. We got up early this morning to move cars around and set up an extension cord for the groomer to use in our driveway. By 8:45, Paulette still had not shown up, so we called and were told Paulette’s GPS placed her at another address 10 miles away. The dispatcher told us another groomer would be scheduled for later in the day, at 4:30 p.m. It is now 5:15, no groomer has shown up, and the office is closed. Horrible customer service. If I could give zero stars, I would.

UPDATE: After posting our review, groomer Lisa called and said she had just seen that our appointment was put on her schedule. We rescheduled for the next day (today). Lisa arrived a little after the scheduled time today, but she was very nice, quick, and did a good job grooming our shih tzu. The problems yesterday that forced us to wake up early prevent me from giving more than three stars, but we'll give Pawgo another chance.< /Review>

I asked to speak to the groomer prior to the app't--never happenend.  when I got the confirmation I sent an e-mail asking Lisa to respond--she didn't.   Lisa arrived an hour and a half early (without a mask)  at 10:30 and said she texted me.  Finally got a text with a time stamp of 10:59--she as finished and gone by then.  She spent 15 minutes with my cat and said he was "getting stressed" so didn't finish.  She charged me $50. instead of the usual $85.  When I got the receipt, I noticed she had added a tip without telling me.  Won't use Pawgo again!<//text>

Lisa O has been our groomer since we rescued our dog. She takes excellent care of him and I wouldn't trust anyone else to do the job. She is a great groomer and my dog loves her.< /review>

Lisa came out to my home and was amazing with both of my dogs! She took her time with each of them, was very caring and was very detailed. Both of my dogs came in the house happy, feeling relaxed and well taken care of. Thank you Lisa.

<review>Shaunte did a great job with our elderly 80lbs+ Austr. cattle dog with a never-ending undercoat.  So convenient!  There was even an issue with the van equipment plug tripping my outside outlet (new house, still working out bugs) but she was prepared with a generator.  Highly recommend.<//review></record>

< review>
Our Pawgo Groomer visited our home, grooming both of my dogs. I noticed when she was loading them in and out of her van, she wasn't using a proper lifting technique - but didn't want to correct the "professional" while she was taking care of my pups. Later that afternoon both of my dogs started to show signs of back injury, like pain when being pet. I hoped it was minor and would resolve itself, but unfortunately a trip to the vet and a round of xrays show that one my dogs, had a slipped disk and paresis from trauma. She will now potentially need MRI scans and surgery if we're unable to resolve it from home. Both of my dogs started showing signs of mishandling after their groom. Back pain, bruises on their rear, a rash from their bath a few days later. I contacted corporate team - after reviewing xrays and talking to the groomer, they offered me a $50 credit - not even a 3rd of the cost of their groom. They didn't offer to cover the medical costs or even refund my groom. so disappointed.<//review>

Our oldest is a 13 year old Brittany spaniel. He has the worse breath in the universe and cannot walk well or stand well. Lisa makes sure she takes her time with him and does a wonderful job. She also did a great job clipping the nails of Zoey our chihuahua mix, and she is pretty temperamental! The convenience of having the service come to us and be completed in the van in our driveway is SUPER efficient. And the pricing is very reasonable!

<Text>They just worked magic to make sure my pup who recently lost his second eye was on the schedule to be groomed that was super convenient for me.  I work with Lisa E and she does great with Rocky as she has taken the time to learn his quirks.  Great Place.  And they come to YOU.  It really isn't much more than a regular groomer so to have them come to me - no brainer!< /Text>< Pics>

He is always groomed exactly the way I ask and clipped and cut, just the way we need him to be… The service is always quick and efficient, and so handy for an animal that does not like to be at a groomer all day! I will continue to use Pawgo- for as long as I have animals that require regular grooming! Cheers to Jace!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Excellent customer service!!!  After having a no show on our appointment today and receiving poor customer service from their manager Italy. I was extremely upset. HOWEVER, Veronica called me back and went out of her way to make things right. First off she apologized, made sure I still received an appointment for both our dogs today, and honored the discount. I then received a reply to my negative review from The Owner, again apologizing and making our next service on them!!! Now that is what I call EXCELLANT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Their system made a mistake and they owned up to it and made things RIGHT! Thank you very much Veronica and the Owner. You still have a loyal customer with us. Shaunte is an excellent groomer for our dogs and we are so glad to have her for them. Have a great day.<//Text>

< Review>
had an appointment for my dog with this company,
and after about 15-20 minutes, my dog started getting really anxious and the groomer refused to continue for both her and my dogs safety (which is totally fine! safety first!) the real horror story is pawgo then charged my bank account $37.50 four times, and $32.50 twice for the visit, instead of $32.50 once. i called the office and was told that none of the transactions went through on their side and they weren’t sure why my account was showing otherwise because they didn’t see it on their end. i ended up calling my bank to stop these duplicate transactions and had to open up a claim to get my money back.

thankfully pawgo ended up finally seeing the duplicate transactions and credited me back, but what a nightmare the whole visit was.<//Review>

<text>Pawgo Groomers is the best! They come right to your door and and take your fur baby out to their fully equipped van and in a little while they are back looking beautiful. Scheduling is no problem and Veronica is always in the office ready to help. We have Carmen and we wouldn"t trade her for anything. She knows the problems of different breeds of dogs and always informs us if something is off with our little girl. The pricing is less than what I paid at Petsmart and she doen"t have to be stuck in a small kennel for several hours waiting to be groomed!!!< /text>< response>

< review>
On Jan 2nd I was to have a cat and 3 dogs groomed.  I had to make arrangements so that I would be home.  The morning of I get a text that the groomer was going to be 5-min early.  "Perfect" was my reply.  A few minutes after that she then sends another text that she has a head cold and cannot make it.  I call their office and they have NO IDEA that she's not feeling well and not working and does not do anything to go out of their way to reschedule my appointment in a timely fashion (it was 2-week out is the best they said they could do).  I cancel completely and I'm getting numerous texts from the groomer who cancelled on me.  Very unprofessional.< /review>

<text>I, as I see a few others as well who this has happened too, was a new customer, eagerly waiting to try their services since I've been having a hard time finding one where I live. I scheduled a 12:30 appointment for yesterday, June 29th, on June 5th. They never showed up and I never heard a word from them about it, until late last night. I tried calling and messaging them and still heard nothing. They then assured me I could be seen today. Well I just got a call from them this morning saying that wouldn't be able to happen either and only offered a $10 discount! Needless to say, I will not be rebooking. I am extremely dissatisfied with their customer service and disappointed as well. Would give 0 stars as well for this service. Completely ridiculous!</text>< Pictures>

I guess I'll never know. My dog is dying from the heat and needs groomed fast. After trying all weekend, these people finally agreed on 3:00pm on 6/4. Silly me thought an OK was committing to the appointment which I did at 10:00am on 6/3. At 11:15am they informed me my appointment was given to someone else and I needed to reschedule. I did, with another groomer. Dont make a commitment with me and renig on it. I'll never know if they do a good job because I will never use them. Don't believe the thing that says they respond in the hour. They don't.</Text>

We had a great, 1st time experience with Galloping Groomer.  As my first time having our new Golden professionally handled, the groomer, Mel, greeted our Goldie appropriately and made suggestions on grooming options.  We were very comfortable with the process and our Goldie looked great after the service.  We will be repeat clients.

Thank you,
Phoenix<//review>

Been a customer with pawgo for about a year now.  Never again!  My wife and I made an appointment for this morning at 7. Got a call from Desiree around 745 saying that she "screwed up" her paperwork and wouldn't be here until 3pm. The hottest part of the day!  Desiree said she would give us a discount so I agreed.  3pm came and went, no call no nothing.  Finally around 430, I get a TEXT saying she was in Waddell and be here in 20 minutes.  When she got here, she said that she didn't realize how far Waddell was from my house.  What should've taken an hour took almost 2 and she only gave us a $15 discount.  Needless to say, this is the last time we will use pawgo.<//text>

They were able to do the appointment the day after I contacted them. I have a very nervous dog and they took great care of him. He looks fantastic and knows it. I'll be using them again!< /Text>

Called to confirm and actually called to say they had an earlier opening and would I prefer that, or keep my original appointment.  Jody, was very nice and super knowledgable.  She was a pleasure to work with.  I would highly recommend their service as it is much less stressful for the pet and pet owner.  My dog was clean, his undercoat was removed, nails trimmed and they were easy to deal with.  Prices are comparable to any other area grooming place but they came to me.  No cages and quick.< /Review></record>

Scheduled and appointment for 4pm for my two dogs. Received a call on the day of the appointment around 11-1130am to be told she would be 2 hours late, and she would not arrive until closer to 6pm. Highly dissatisfied, ended up cancelling the appointment completely due to the huge inconvenience.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Very bad service    I will stick to my groomer. She bathe my dog. And cleans face ,ears these people can't even do that with a bathe.   Very disappointed.  Will never use them again. Lady Veronica was rude. When I told I was no happy yeah gave me a $25 discount. But that was not the point  I have dog two where bathe and 2 groom all four in less then 4 hour. Wow.  I was blow away how quick it was done lousy service.  I can say I love my groomer Tracy.  She the best. I will never trade her for no other groomer she down for a while.   But my dogs while have to wait for there groomer. No more will I use any other service.  Galloping. Groomer.  You will never get my service again.  .</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Mel is great with my dogs! This company is on time for appointments.
Respectful and clean. I hated taking my dog to groomer as it always take all day. I'm anxious and my dog is anxious.

So much stress is reduced for us both by having them come to my house.
I actually save money by not driving and my time involved.
This is a piece of cake!
Thank You so much

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I called pawgo last week Veronica said they were all booked out for a few weeks but I needed my guy groomed he was a mess. So I was okay with waiting a couple of weeks but then she said that they may have an opening for me the up and coming Monday morning so she booked me in and even though there were a couple of snags with getting to me at the scheduled time they called and let me know about the delay which I admire in a company. Maria got here and I left my Jak in her hands while I ran my errands and I come back to a beautiful wonderfully clean best bud. I am not one for giving reviews unless my experience is beyond what I expect. In this case they did a great job and I will be using Pawgo again and recommend them to anyone who asks. Thank you Veronica and Maria for taking care of my buddy<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

We are very glad to have found Galloping Groomer since we could no longer take our dog to a regular grooming salon.  Had tried calling other mobile groomers and the prices were extremely expensive. Galloping Groomer sanitizes before the grooming, since our dog has a suppressed immune system because of medicine.  Their prices are reasonable, they are cooperative and do a nice job.<//review>

I did tell the owner what i was looking for and he sent Kay.
Kay was awesome. Everything I was looking for in a groomer. She was so patient and My dog was comfortable immediately. None of the shaking and traumatized look he had when i dropped him at the other place. I will definitely use them again and recommend them to all my dog loving friends. And I highly recommend giving Kay a try.

I will say that the tight schedule they are on doesn't leave a lot of time between appts so if they run a little late just know that your dog will get the same attention the one prior to your appt did and I was A-okay with that!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Lisa "groomed" my girls. New employee.
I wasn't as happy as I thought I was with this company. I was quoted for my 2 girls to get a bath and brush and get their nails filed, and ears cleaned.  My one dog was suppose to get De-shedded. She is still shedding, she still feels dirty to the touch, both of them do, neither of their nails got filed. Not sure if my one dogs nails were even trimmed because they still click on the floor and look exactly the same as they did. Their ears WERE done. At least they smelled like it. It took her 20 minutes to bathe my boxer, do the nails, and the ears. How is this possible in 20 minutes? And have it done correctly? She still feels dirty. Ya know that film you get on your hands after you let a dirty dog? That's what they both have still, or maybe because she did it to fast she missed soap on them. I used to be a groomer. Also, when she brought my shedder girl back to me, she said she could Dremel her nails because she didn't like it. I told them when i scheduled the appointment they can muzzle them if needed to get their nails done  they needed it badly. Why wasn't this done? When i went out to get my second dog, Lisa mentioned she "might" have filed roxys nails. Might Have? How can you not know? I even called the office and told them this, she said she didn't agree with that. None the less I still ended up paying my quoted price of $126 even when everything wasn't done. I've been thinking about this since yesterday when they came, and I just can't get it to stop bothering me. I feel like my dogs didn't get the service they were suppose to, and I feel I was charged wrongly. I shouldn't have to pay for something that wasn't done. I won't be using this company again.  I will be using my original Mobil groomer. I just have to meet them somewhere because they don't come to my area, but totally worth It! When I used my last groomer, my Roxy didn't shed at all after her groom. That's what a De-shed is suppose to be!</Text>

This is the first time I had Yvonne groom my cat.  She was very professional and caring for my 13 old Ozzy.  I will be sure to request her when the next appointment is due.  Thank you, Yvonne!< /Text>

Quiani with pawgo grooming did an absolutely amazing job. First off she arrived early, which is always nice and she arrived with a pleasant attitude and a smile on her face when my dogs ran out to see her. Will definitely be using her to groom all my dogs in the future. Very affordable and lowest prices I've seen with high quality work. He went in smelling bad and his hair was slightly matted and he came out smelling fresh and looking better than he ever has before. He always used to come home from the groomers with razor burns and cuts but with pawgo that was not an issue.< /Text>

<Text>Quiani did an awesome job with my older "daughter" Savanna, her hair just grows and grows till it dreads and knots so since it had been about 7 months since she last had it cut, it was about 5-6 inches long.  Took Quiani just over an hour to groom her shaved and she looks great! Thanks Quiani and galloping groomers!</Text>< Time>

Tried to get an appointment three different times. The last time on the phone they told me they weren't available to come to tolleson wednesday, Thursday, friday, or Saturday for the next few weeks. I could tell on the phone she was just trying to be snobby and get me off the phone. I've since then taken my business to the woof wagon.< /Text>

<Text>This was a great venue for a small rock show.  I was really impressed.  They have a great bar and bartenders.

The stage is small but in all honesty there is plenty of room on the floor.  The sound is also pretty good too for the size of the room.

Their women's bathroom was very nice.  It is a rock club so no surprise there.

I loved the show and everything about the location.  Its in an interesting neighborhood.  Not to mention the great sandwich shop next door.

If you get the opportunity to come to show at The Golden Bull do it.  Its really fun.< /Text><Date>1608003296421</Date>< gmap_id>

A dive in the best way possible, this was hands down the spot if you're in Downtown Oakland. The bartender was cool and made some stiff drinks. Stay for the goth/punk shows!< /text>

The Golden Bull is literally like my second home. I have so many amazing memories and experiences at this bar. The staff, owners and co-owners have always been so friendly, professional and sweet. They have amazing shows and  not over priced drinks!! The bartenders are also the sweetest!! I love this place and highly recommend it!< /text>

I love the Golden Bull!  I’ve seen a couple shows here this past year, and had a great time at each.  Friendly and attentive owners/staff who really care about their business.  And I love the self serve water cooler they leave out at shows so you don’t have to wait in line with everyone else who’s ordering drinks when all you want is water.<//text>

One of my favorite places to be in Oakland! Great taste in bands and deejays. I am not local, but on my last two visits I got to see amazing bands and soul/power pop sets by local deejays. I wish this was *my* neighborhood hangout! Great atmosphere, and a decent size to see a show that makes it feel intimate and yet spacious enough at the same time. Professional staff and friendly management. Will for sure return on future visits to the Bay Area!</Text>

Would definitely visit again and recommend if you’re a fan of live music and great hangouts with a cool laid back vibe.</review>< Pictures>

<review>I had visited The Golden Bull the day before NYE and was warmly welcomed by staff and regulars of the bar.

However, the main purpose of my visit was for the NYE party/gig, which was well managed and everything I could have hoped for (and more). The atmosphere itself was electrifying, mixed with great drink, food and people. I would highly recommend a visit to The Golden Bull if you're looking for a local, friendly and flippin' amazing bar, I know I'll definitely be back!!< /review><UserId.>116981582418740515684<//UserId.><GmapID>0x808f80b3f07b34a1:0xca9a531854539e86<//GmapID>< name>

Good bar to hang out. Nice bartenders. Decently sized place. Can get pretty loud when they've got live bands playing so if you're looking for a chill night, it may not be the best place for you. Reasonably priced drinks.< /text>

< review>
I've been at this bar a couple of times for concerts. Even though the view on the stage is exceptional, I give this note because of the way I was treated by the staff (ownership) after being attacked, twice, by the same person, coming to see the concerts as well. Some co-owners treated me as if I was the attacker, literally accusing me of wanting to make trouble, and physically pushing me when I was trying to defend myself because the security wouldn't do it, as the only persons who stopped the attacker were other attendees of the show. The security put no pressure on this person to stop.

As I had been targeted by this person for the second time in the same place, I called a police officer a couple of nights later, purposefully on a day when there was nothing happening there (and practically no one inside, even less outside in the street), for a report against my attacker, and asked the members of the bar staff present if they could give him their testimony after what they've seen. The security played the game, but the ownership behaved ridiculously bad towards me. Pretending they had never seen me, which was false. Pretending they didn't know who my attacker was, which as I found out later was false again. Finding a stratagem to lead me out of the bar when I would speak with the officer, and then leave the security to tell me that I was forbidden to come back in. Because the staff of this bar didn't want to admit that they had not handled well the attack I had been victim of in the first place, and so they didn't accept that I would call the police, even for a simple report, even on an evening where there was nothing happening at the bar, even though the officer was very kind and that there's no way his presence at the entrance for a few minutes could have caused any prejudice to the bar. The bar staff wasn't willing to see that I had called the police because they themselves had showed to be unable (and / or unwilling) to deal correctly with the person attacking me. Maybe because this person is American, and ostensibly wealthy and socially surrounded, while I am not.

Once again, I don't blame any member of the security individually, I blame the ownership that seemed to be only interested in keeping a reputation they visibly don't deserve, and keep getting the money deriving from it. The least of their concerns was the way I felt after their failing to take in charge my attacker, and then again after their unjustified, dishonest and violent attitude, when I only wanted a testimony from them, which was the least they could've done for me at that point.

Edit: for info a few persons left a review right after mine which happen to be my attacker (Jessica Deen) and a few of her friends : Erin Ryan, Montclare, Alison Munin, Shelby McElrath, to mention only them (but seeing the time coincidence, there seems to be several others, since I haven't myself written this review right after the gig, more like a week after, but they have all written their reviews simultaneously and immediately after mine...), which have all known of me online, and have been apparentely following me everywhere on internet lately. Funny to see that these persons barely have written any Google reviews apart from this one. All adding to their sad history of online and real life bullying attempts. Which seems to take most of their time. Good luck guys!< /review>

I hate that I only recently decided to have drinks here. It's a cool place with a not so level pool table and a stage for shows. The bathrooms are on par with what you might expect from a place that has a lot of shows with people drinking a lot of beer. They're okay. Popcorn up front and I think they just opened the doors for lunch -- bring your food in and have a brew!< /review>

This little bar has it all: wonderful staff,  great range of drinks,  excellent variety of underground live music and dj nights with an excellent sound system, and clean bathrooms! Right next to BART,  happy hours, and drink specials are also part of the package.< /Review>

Just did a gig here and I have nothing but great things to say about this place!
Sound guy was totally cool and made every band sound awesome.
Staff was great too!
I'm glad this places exists cuz they do a great service to musicians local & touring to keep the live music scene alive. We hope to play a weekend show here soon.
Oh and the beer selection was not too shabby either!</review>

Very much a favorite spot to stop in when I'm in Oakland. A great place to just unwind and catch a drink with friends. They have a pool table and sometimes you can catch a live show.</review>

About the only complaint I would have about this place is I wish that it was in a slightly bigger venue so that way the stage was bigger. It can get rather crowded really quickly depending on who is playing. But still I really enjoy it.<//review>

"AltaCali Third Thursdays" is an incredible night of entertainment. The live music was sooooo good! Afro-Cuban, Spanish-Flamenco Soul music with hot dancers on stage and the DJ was ass shakingly fantastic! I'll definitely be there for the next AltaCali Third Thursdays!</text>

Worst bar  i've been to in a while.  Me and the seven of my friends went and were all disappointed by the drinks the rudeness of the bartenders and the bouncer As we were leaving the bar closed up  and the bouncer would not let three women use the restroom because they were closing up. The ladies had to walk for 20 minutes  to find the nearest restroom after pleading with the bouncer to let the women use the restroom and leave..... would highly discourage anyone looking to have a fun happy vibe to go here

@Peppi Rose - Im sure letting someone use your restroom would be among one of the laws top concerns....< /text>

Great small local place to hangout with plenty of options to choose from to drink! Right next to the bar is a place where you order the food(Vegan and non-vegan friendly) and they deliver it to you!!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) A miracle place where you can see your favorite artist for $ 30! ! ! Since it was a small venue, artists were able to shake hands in front of them. Convenient even late at night because it's right from the station.
At first glance, the threshold was high, but all of them were normal friendly people.
Although liquor is inevitable because of prices, it hurts my wallet at around $ 10!
Thanks to ATMs, cash was also reduced.

(Original)
大好きなアーティストを30ドルで本当に間近で見られた奇跡の場所！！！小さめの会場だからアーティストも目の前を歩いていて握手できた。駅からすぐなので夜遅くても便利。
一見敷居が高かったけどみんな普通の気さくな人たち。
お酒は物価のせいで仕方ないけど10ドル前後で財布に痛い！
ATMもあったおかげで現金もおろせた。<//text>

<Text>I have heard of this place but had never ventured into this delightful place until today.  They were advertising a block print workshop and my girlfriends and I decided to try it out.  Señor Luis was welcoming to all who attended the sold out workshop.  He was knowledgeable and passionate about the subject and was so helpful and patient.  This is a gem that up until now was hidden to me.  I'm so glad I learned about the amazing activities they host, especially the youth pop ups.  It's so important for youth to have healthy and creative outlets for expression. Thank you, Sol Collective.<//Text>< pictures>

My new go-to salon for all of my hair needs, whether it’s a quick, cute buzz & cut, picking up my essential hair products, or going blonde...this is your one-stop shop for sure! I went in for full blonde highlights today. I showed them photo examples of what I wanted and they nailed it EXACTLY! And the color is truly beautiful! Take a look at my pics for yourself. The Maxi Hair Salon staff listen, they are kind, they are affordable, and they are technically-proficient. I cannot emphasize enough how pleased I am with my results! So happy!! A million thanks, Maxi Hair Salon!!</text>

<text>I stated growing long hair once I got to Berkeley because I couldn't find any barbers that I was satisfied with. Eventually longer hair just made me even more picky to decide where I wanted get it cut. However Ellie is super competent and over the past year she's done an amazing job whether it's long or short hair and has even made sure to always give me tips on how to style it!< /text><rating>5<//rating><name>Deep Dave<//name></record>

I went to Ellie for my eyebrows throughout my time as a Berkeley student, and she is amazing! She is extremely meticulous and always left my eyebrows perfectly shaped and just the right thickness. She plucks instead of threading or waxing, so there is minimal pain and your skin won't be irritated afterward. Ellie is also very warm and friendly, and her price is reasonable ($15). I will miss getting my eyebrows done at Maxi Hair Salon!</Text>

I went to this hair salon to have my hair done for an event, and they did a wonderful job. I asked for an intricately styled updo (showed a picture), and the final result (see uploaded picture) looked exactly as I wanted it. Very reasonably priced ($90) for a full hour of work. Would highly recommend.</review>

Wanted to cut and color my hair and decided to give this place a try since all the good reviews and  my friends talked so highly of them. Well, I wasn’t disappointed.  I got a beautiful, natural balayage. I get compliments on it all the time and some think is my natural hair color!
What I was hoping for and beyond! Very reasonable prices too.  I love my hair. Will definitely come back.< /text>

I’ve been to Several of the hairstylist here and they have always been consistent in giving me an amazing haircut. They are also super personable, and will provide you with an excellent service each time. I love coming here, it’s not over priced either and I think they give the students in the area a pretty good discount. Highly recommend them!!</review>

I have been here twice and both times have been delightful. The place is clean and well-managed, and the stylists are professional, friendly and adept at their craft. I was really happy witha few of their specialty services, including a Deva cut for curly hair, and eyebrow threading. Normally, Deva cuts can run on the expensive side, but the stylists at Maxi salon do a professional job at a student-friendly price. I'm really happy with the service I got, and will definitely return!</Text>

I have been a regular for over 15 YEARS and I have referred many friends there over the years . I once referred a student of mine there who later moved to Scotland for her PHD but still makes a point of going to Maxi when she is visiting!  true story and I have many more like this! Anyone I send there becomes a regular regardless of age group!  Very high quality work!<//review>

<Review>Finally I have found someone that really knows how to cut wavy very layered hair. I went to Lien (Lynn) and she took so much time with me and listened to what I wanted and did the best layered cut I have had in literally 30 years. She also waxed and dyed my brows and did a fantastic job. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend her to anyone! The price was very reasonable too. :)</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Time>1435487135618</Time>< name>

<Text>I've been a satisfied customer of Maxi Hair Salon for many years and enjoyed not only my interactions with the staff but also observing the diversity of her clientele. I've heard everything from an in-depth conversation on the best shade of purple to grandmothers stating they need a great style for a hot date. They do a great job with men and women, I’m envious of some styles for males that just wouldn’t work on me (long past my 20’s, lol). The shop is clean and airy and foot traffic makes for good people watching while you’re in the chair. The online booking site is a breeze to use and shows you both availability and prices.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I love this salon! We use to live in Berkeley and went there for over 20 years. Now that we moved to LA we still try to coordinate our trips so we can still get our hair and my eyebrows done there.  They are so good at what they do.  They do amzing job for my husband and my sons haircut as well as high lighting and cutting my difficult hair. Very reasonable prices as well. Highly recommended them!
If I could give more stars i would! :)< /Review>

< Review>
Been going on and off for over a year depending on where I lived. But as soon as I moved back to the bay area, I was looking forward to making an appointment with Ellie at Maxi Hair Salon. Ellie, Hannah and other staff have been super friendly and always enjoy seeing you coming in. Ellie remembers what kind of hair style you want and you always leave the place, looking forward to coming back. I really enjoy Maxi Hair salon.<//Review>

I was visiting town and went in for a same-day cut with Olivia. She listened to exactly what I wanted and helped thin my long, thick hair immensely for the summer. I would absolutely recommend, and wish I could be a regular here.<//review>

You have to watch out for non-English or bad English speaking businesses. On top of that you give them clear speaking instructions and later on when you complain about them giving the wrong haircut, they have this attitude of you  being wrong. Only the owner speaks good English. It's hard to find a good barber that speaks good English and good customer service!!< /text>

Think about that for a second. Why would i come to a place for 18yrs if they didnt to A+ work especially when Im about quality of work? Price and quality of work is what matters; Maxi Hair has both.</Text>< pictures>

I have been going to Maxi Hair Care since they opened back in the early 1990's when I a student at Cal.  While I no longer live in Berkeley, I still go miles out of my way to Maxi's to get my hair cut since they always do a great job.  I highly recommend them.</text>

Great for food allergies. At the word "gluten," she ripped off her gloves and had the next serve change gloves too. She even offered to swap out the serving spoons.< /Review>

I've been coming to the Paso Robles location since it opened and always had good, friendly service until today. In the past I was told that you could ask that the hot items on the salad  be put in separate cups since i always take to go. Today i encountered a very rude "new" manager after completing the order he told me he would allow this 1 time but not future orders or i'll be charged for each item separately.  I tried to explain about what i was previously told and he cut me off and  raised his voice in front of other customers. Not sure if i'll be returning.<//Text>

<review>It says they close at 10 on here but they actually close at 9. I know because I drove there at 9:12 and saw the writing in the door. Very depressing. They close at 9 every day. 😭 I’m only giving three stars because of my own sadness and disappointment. It’s a great place to grab a bite.</review>< pics>

<Text>It’s a clean and accessible location.  If you eat too much, go to Target and walk around.  If you’re waiting for Supercuts and you’re hungry, get a burrito at Chipotle.  If you want coffee with your burrito, there’s a Starbucks.  The staff is friendly and always makes sure they get your order right!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>The food is great, the service is friendly and professional, however the area is plagued by bums sitting outside accosting you for money by the entrance to every place on this strip of shops. They literally sit there charging their brand new iPhones and playing music on their speakers whilst holding signs and even running up to you saying "hey, what's up, do you have a dollar or some change?". I haven't been back since last time it happened. I'm afraid I might smack the next 20 year old that has a skateboard and iPhone asking me for money.< /Review>< Date>

Vegan option is fantastic. Also letting my daughter pick and choose ingredients made it fun for her (she's a picky six year old). We don't get to go out much, but when we do again this is our new place 😋</text>

<Text>Rosalie and Leslie are the two best employees I have ever encountered at Chipotle. I eat at Chipotle restaurants across the west coast frequently and I've never been treated so well. Everyone there is an asset to the chain but these two stood out amongst the hundreds of employees I've encountered in my travels.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>No real point in stopping here unless you're into watching high school sophomores make you a burrito.
Nothing against the kids working there, they were nice enough.The guacamole was pretty good (nothing out of this world) and they have a bunch of different hot sauces, so that's neat.
The food was about on par with what you should expect from a big chain restaurant. This is California, there are good Mexican restaurants within walking distance from here.<//review><Date>1491528127311</Date>< Name>

The staff is very friendly and the food is great, if you like Chipotle. Closer and easier to access than the San Luis Chiptole from Atascadero.< /review>

The first and last time I was here, i was served a burrito that was 80% guacamole. Although guac is good, a giant log of guac in a tortilla is not.<//text>

Skimpy on the servings. Made me sad. Double meat looked like a half serving. When you pay that much for a burrito you should have a double serving. Service was upset that they had a job.<//Review>

<review>My husband recently had surgery with Dr. Laguna and is beyond happy with his results. Dr. Laguna has an amazing bedside manner and is very passionate about his work. From pre-op to post-op, Dr. Laguna's  staff has been very attentive to his needs and helpful in navigating the surgical process. Jasmine, his lymphatic massage therapist, has been beyond amazing, and the lymphatic massages themselves have been highly beneficial to his post-op care. Overall, Dr. Laguna and his staff are wonderful and I would highly recommend!</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<gmapID>0x80dce55ba4bac5f5:0x1a63c36560207580</gmapID><Review>Let me start from the end. My results post op are AMAZING. My abs and flanks are shredded and I have a double V pointing South. Dr Laguna (Dr. Mowlavi) is a brilliant surgeon, artist and sculptor when it comes to Vasor Liposuction. If you want to remove the apprehension, unknowns and anxiety of how your going to look and feel and want that comfort and confidence that you are going to have incredible results; put your body in the hands of Dr. Laguna; you can relax now. He runs a 5 star practice.

I’m a 46 year old male that ate a somewhat healthy diet  for years while working out regularly 5-6 days a week. The course of nature started reclaiming the work I’ve been putting in by enveloping my abdomen; chest and back with layers and rolls of fat that would ultimately strip me of the definition I once had. I was losing myself and at a crossroads. Let go and concede to the process of aging or undergo liposuction.

I made the decision to have Vasor liposuction; but the stressful overwhelming question was who to trust. I decided to search out the Dr. with the best reviews and highest ratings and without question; Dr. Laguna stood out by far. I called; then eventually met with the Dr. and Claudia who was absolutely wonderful and walked me through the whole process. I could not have been made to feel more comfortable and through everything I gathered through the consultations i went ahead with the procedure.

Following the procedure I was whisked away to a surgical recovery suite where I had 24 hour monitoring by nurses who took meticulous care of me (Thank you Samaya) The following day I was brought back to Dr. Mowlavi’s office for my first of 7 lymphatic massages. I cannot stress enough; those massages are blessings that steadily and continuously pull you up and recalibrate your body back to the path of normalcy. My massage therapist Theresa was a beacon of light; a source of strength, comfort and a beautiful spirit of energy and healing that transcended through her hands.

In the end, I’m healing wonderfully and mission accomplished. Dr. Laguna not only returned my body to pre-fat but then took it up another 1,000 levels where my physique is nothing short of Stunning and jaw dropping. If you can; DO IT !!!!!< /Review>< user>

From beginning to end, Dr. Mowlavi and his team took care of me and made sure I felt comfortable throughout the whole process.  I couldn’t be happier with the results and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to anyone who wants plastic surgery done RIGHT!  Thank you, Dr Mowlavi!</review>

I had a mini tummy tuck, liposuction and BBL. Dr. Mowlavi is extremely professional and kind and sensitive to my needs. He listened well and co-created a surgically plan to meet our fully discussed goals. I am 9 weeks post surgery and look hot and feel great. My surgical scar is healing well. I am looking forward to wearing my bikini. I highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi and his amazing team.</Text>

Amazing, the entire process from the consultation, surgery to after care massages. Dr M is very personal and hands on during the entire process. James and Claire were always there anytime I had a question. But my favorite was Theresa the massage therapist, I even booked four extra massages, she is such a kind, loving and genuine person.< /review>

It has been an absolute dream getting my body transformed by Dr. Mowlavi. From the start, Dr. Mowlavi has been so gracious and attentive to my surgical needs, not to mention his lovely staff who is always there to help with any pre- and post-surgical questions to make the entire process more seamless.  I have referred countless patients to Dr. Mowlavi as I know he will deliver wonderful results each and every time.< /Review>

I flew in from out-of-town to get a total body transformation from Dr. Mowlavi and I couldn’t be happier with my results. His staff was so gracious and accommodating with my pre- and post-care, and I am very grateful to them all. Would highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi for his surgical and artistic expertise!<//review>

After losing over 160 lbs, I was struggling to find a doctor who could help me with my loose skin and help me achieve my dream body after all my hard work. With Dr. Mowlavi, I found a true gem of a surgeon. He executed my wants and desires and i couldn’t be any happier. He had a wonderful bedside manner and never made me feel insecure, starting from my initial consultation in which I felt the most vulnerable in my own skin. For anyone who has undergone extreme weight loss and is looking for the next step in achieving their dream body goals, I would highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi. You will not be disappointed!< /review>

Worst surgeon you’ll ever meet. I’ve been to a couple of surgeons and none have treated me the way this guy did. He only cares about easy procedures that will benefit him. The most arrogant dude you’ll ever meet.

Let me tell you.. I walk in and the receptionist are nice and all. As soon as I go Into one of the rooms, Doctor takes a look at me and bluntly says “let me see, no theres nothing I can do” he didn’t even try to give me options, explanations or anything.

I also feel he bluntly racially profiles you. I say this because I’m a 25 year old Latino male and don’t have a good insurance, (I overheard him talking to his receptionist about my insurance) but why do I need insurance if I have the money to pay right?

Trust me save your money. Based on that experience alone I can tell you he does not care about his patients. I wouldn’t let this guy near my face.<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Mowlavi is the BEST at what he does.  I am 4 weeks post op from a full tummy tuck, breast lift, and BBL and I couldn't be happier with my results. It is really life changing,  All of his staff are extremely nice, caring, and professional (Special shout out to Theresa and James who have helped my so much with my aftercare.) Dr. Mowlavi is very particular and has an eye for symmetry and shape. He makes sure he can give his patients the best results. It is really a work of art. I wish I would have done it sooner. Thank you so much.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>Dr. Mowlavi and his staff are amazing. When I came in for my first consultation he was just on point and understood what I wanted and visualized how I would look. I still had my doubts so I came for a second consultation and he just made me feel that the decision I was making was just right. After surgery the care and the whole process recovery has been amazing. Planning everything accordingly and setting appointments has worked with my schedule and just a overall amazing experience. My friends and family are excited and looking forward to seeing my results and set up there consultation with him.</review>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I finally came to Dr. Mowlavi after 3 rounds of botched liposuction, as well as a faulty tummy tuck incision line. I cannot be happier with my results and I wish I went with Dr. Mowlavi from the start. Dr. Mowlavi is truly an excellent, skilled surgeon and body sculptor. I am one-month post-op and I am in love with my hourglass figure - something I have been trying to achieve since the beginning of my cosmetic surgery journey. My post-op care with James, Dr. Mowlavi’s surgical tech, has been exceptional. James is so patient and understanding and is truly a delight to speak to about post-surgical care.  Theresa, my massage therapist, has been awesome as well with the post-lymphatic massages. I have always felt at home with Dr. Mowlavi and his staff and I would highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone in need of cosmetic procedures!< /text>< pictures>

Dr. Mowlavi is a perfectionist. I felt so comfortable through the entire process and all my questions were answered. After several consultations, I chose Dr. Mowlavi because of his knowledge and expertise. His staff are all wonderful and made my experience comfortable and stress free. I am one week post surgery and my results look amazing!<//review>

I was very scared going into this surgery, however from the get go Dr. Mowlavi was very reassuring and gentle, which made me feel as though I was in excellent hands. Though the surgery was going go be painful, Dr. Mowlavi made me feel at ease and I knew the surgery was going to result in a great outcome. I am one month out of my surgery, and I am in love with my results - I have my nose back thanks to Dr.Mowlavi!

Dr. Mowlavi is an amazing surgeon. From the time I came in for my first consult to now post-surgery, Dr. Mowlavi and his entire team have made me feel safe, reassured, and confident in my results. Dr. Mowlavi has always been available to answer my questions, big or small, and I truly appreciate his expertise in this field. He is a true sculptor and artist and I am beyond ecstatic with my new body! I would highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone who wishes to achieve their dream body - Dr. Mowlavi cannot be beat!<//Review>

Anything I needed after my surgery they helped me with. I had their phone numbers and they were responsive day and night. I think it’s one thing for a doctor to do great work but without a great team patients are left feeling upset and Dr Mowlavi has found a fantastic team to ensure that doesn’t happen.

My results are exactly as expected. I have literally no fat left in my waist and have hips. Pretty cool to wake up to :)</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I have been considering my surgery for many years and just never could muster up the courage to do it. When I walked through the door at Dr Mowlavi’s office for my original consultation, I felt welcomed and so comfortable. Dr Mowlavi is the kindest, most down to earth doctor. He listens, advises and helps you make the best decision possible for your wants.
The process of gearing up for surgery was so easy. His staff.... AWESOME! From the front office staff greeting you warmly every time you walk through the door, to Claudia preparing everything you need for surgery, to after care lymphatic massage with the absolutely amazing Jasmine. James, basically the Superman of the office, has been amazing as well. So professional, funny and helpful and available.
I just can’t say enough about how great the whole entire process was. I recommend Dr Mowlavi and his team with my whole heart. You will be comfortable, cared for by compassionate staff and satisfied with your results.
The after care program he offers is so beneficial and will bring you the results you were looking for when you first started your journey of having surgery. Thank you Dr Mowlavi and staff. My words could never express my gratitude for the care you gave me.< /review><Date>1601318618856</Date>< pics>

When you call for an appointment, it's very quick and they work with you to fit your schedule as best as possible. Everyone loves my results, and Claudia is great.

Dr. Mowlavi and his staff have been great. He has been super available to answer any questions and concerns I may have. I have been in the medical field for 25 years and this is easily one of the nicest offices I have encountered. Claudia is amazing, the massages are super helpful and make the recovery much better. I am only a few days out and already have a surprising amount of mobility. Look no further for your surgery needs!<//review>

Dr. Mowlavi is a great guy. He did my medicare paid mole removal in a prominent spot on my face that my dermatologist did not want to touch. I think negative reviews, if any, must come from high maintenance people.

If you want a positive experience go with the flow, get an early appointment or you will wait, he is very busy. He is worth waiting for.

I was so happy to have this surgery over with and done so well I do not think there will even be  trace of a scar. Great bedside manner, but he does go with the attitude you bring into the office with you. If you are cranky and angry I don't think you should bring that to his doorstep. There is no harm in appreciating an artist! Sure he has an ego, he's entitled to it and from my experience he is also a kind and pleasant man, as is his staff. I drove 45 min to get to his office and did not mind it because of the results he delivered. Dr. Laguna! Yay!</Text>

Dr. Mowlavi and his staff are incredibly friendly and professional! He is very detail oriented and personalizes his procedures to your needs! I am about a month out from my eyelid surgery and could not be happier! He is extremely caring to all his patients and I’ve never had a doctor treat me the way he does. It’s truly amazing and I would recommend him to everyone!<//review>

I called this office and spoke with Claudia and made an appointment  and she insisted that I’ll be there on time or will not be seen. I arrived 10 minutes early and they did not even had me down on the schedule even though I had txted them my implant card and full name. It took an hour and half just to be seen and during the time I was waiting in the lobby I witnessed several patients had similar issues and shaking their heads. After leaving we I had scheduled a Skype call to go over my plan which they didn’t even call me to let me know that they were not going make it, and I had to call myself and was informed that the doctor simply thinks that I’m not a good fit. This was all a huge inconvenience and overall a very bad experience with this surgeon. I think the staff were very unprofessional and unorganized and the surgeon did not follow up with me and seemed very careless and impatient.<//Review>

I cannot describe enough the awesome experience I had with Dr. Mowlavi and his staff. Claudia, his coordinator was amazing from the get go, helping me with appointments that work with my busy work schedule. James has been nothing but exceptional. They are all super friendly.
My surgery experience was phenomenal. I was back at work within 10 days and my follow up appointments have been great. Recovering still at 6 weeks post up  my loving my new body. I greatly recommend Dr. Laguna for any of your cosmetic needs.<//Review>

I want to start by saying that Dr. Mowlavi is an absolute artist and the best at what he does, nobody compares to him and his work. His surgical team was is some of the nicest people they made me feel so comfortable and re assured me I was going to be taken care of the anesthesiologist was super informative and was great even funny. AJ noticed while I was laying on the table could see I was getting scared and nervous he looked down at me and said don’t worry everything is going to be ok, we will take care of you and I immediately felt relief. My nurse was super sweet and took great care of me until I left to the recovery house. The whole vibe is the room was amazing. The after care I received at the recovery house was amazing too, they take great care of you. However my only reason for giving the 4 star rating is the after care i have received has not been good, I have felt like ok we did Your surgery and we are done. I was told by Claudia the patient coordinator that it is my responsibility to reach out them when I am home they leave it to me. I live in Colorado and flew to California to get this done, I shouldn’t have to be the one to reach out to do anything. I was in contact with her for over a year and was never made aware once of possible issues that I could when I come home. And this was nothing cheap. It’s really upsetting and disappointing to feel like no one cares about you after this is over. However if it had not been for  Polly my massage therapist helping me and guiding me since I was in California and since I have been home I would of been lost. Next to the Dr’s work Polly has been one of the best things that came out of the office the care she puts into her massages and willingness to help has made things so much better for me. Every massage I had with her she made me feel better and gave me hope. Even since I have been home for about 2 weeks she has checked  on me and answers all of my questions. I truly thank Dr. Mowlavi for my surgery, he did better than what I would of asked for.< /text>

<text>Where do I even begin with Dr. Mowlavi - from the time that I came to the office, the staff themselves were very knowledgeable and amazing. They were all very professional when it came to the surgical paperwork and Claudia, Dr. Mowlavi’s patient coordinator, was especially helpful in guiding me through the surgical process - she was always very patient in answering all of my pre- and post operative questions. The surgery itself was like a dance party - when I came into the operating room, I was so incredibly comfortable with the entire operating room staff. I felt no anxiety going into the surgery at that moment, which is very rare to feel. When I went into the PACU after surgery, I was surrounded with Dr. Mowlavi’s nursing staff who kept me at ease and made sure I was healing okay. My post-operative experience the days following surgery were amazing as well - I have never seen a surgery center operate so well. Everyone has their place and position and is so accommodating. I highly recommend that each and every patient pursue the post-lymphatic massages offered by Dr. Mowlavi and his massage therapists. Theresa, my massage therapist, has been incredible. She is so gentle and ensured my post-op care was seamless. James, Dr. Mowlavi’s surgical technician, was always very personable and I truly appreciated that so much. I am due back for another surgery with Dr. Mowlavi soon - Dr. Mowlavi will be my Doctor for life! Would highly recommend him to anyone in need of cosmetic surgery.</text><name>K Real Estate Services Kerry Thomson</name><GmapID>0x80dce55ba4bac5f5:0x1a63c36560207580< /GmapID><Response>None< /Response>< UserId.>

<text>I was referred to dr. Mowlavi by Dr. Gaw for my breast lift following a partial mastectomy. This staff and Kyle in particular treated me much care and greeted me with open arms. Dr. Mowlavi made me feel very comfortable and assured me throughout this process. I am about 1 week out and the recover has been painless and the results are as promised. I will come to dr. Mowlavi for any other procedures I may need! I will definitely be referring him to anyone looking for a plastic surgeon.</text>< username>

<user>109743560751407440992< /user><review>I love this office! All of the employees have been extremely sweet and answer any question you may have. Claudia and James are amazingly helpful and I came from out of town so they made the whole trip super easy to plan. Dr. Mowlavi makes a great connection with his patients while also being extremely professional! I felt very comfortable before the surgery because of the constant attention they all provide here. Dr. Mowlavi really held my hand throughout the surgery and made me forget any fears I had prior to the surgery. He is an incredible surgeon and an incredible person! The post-operative care was great and I highly recommend the after-care. The massages are also a life-saver (and it's great that they are included in your fee upfront, some offices don't do that!). I did a ton of research and he was incredibly fair with his pricing and his results are unmatched! I feel much better after every visit to this office and cannot recommend it enough.</review><username>Monica Santos< /username>< rating>

Dr. Mowlavi is incredibly knowledgeable! He made sure I knew exactly what to expect coming into the surgery and I felt confident that he could deliver. The entire office is amazing. I am 1 week out and they are constantly helping with pain management and recovery. Prolly, the massage therapist, is incredible at eliminating swelling and pain. Dr. Mowlavi did an incredible job eliminating all the stubborn fat that I couldn’t get rid of through working out. I can’t wait to hit the gym and watch my muscles pop! Thank you to everyone in this amazing office!<//review>

I am definitely very happy with my results. I am trying to be patient with the slight swelling in the areas of where I had my liposuction and fat grafting done, but it is early and I am already impressed with my results thus far. My experience has been good, well, really, really good. I did not have drains and was really really happy with that obviously. So far, I am loving the results and am beyond excited for 2-3 month mark. Thank you Dr. Mowlavi and thank you to your team!</text>

<Review>I came to Dr. Mowlavi for a Full-Body Lift and am amazed by the results! I truly feel like a brand new person and am forever grateful. I am 3 months out and I have loved the entire experience. He and his staff are always available (even on the weekends) and prepared me for everything that was to come. He really makes you feel safe and confident in your decision. His after-care has been amazing and the massages are a MUST. Dr. Mowlavi is an amazing surgeon and really knows what he's doing. I highly recommend him to anyone for body contouring!</Review>< Response>

Dr. Mowlavi and his team are so great. Beginning to end has been amazing. Dr. Mowlavi had given me a thorough explanation of what to expect and what I wanted to get done and how he was going to give me the results I wanted. The recovery at the cottage was above amazing and Polly has also been above amazing. They let me exactly what I was going to expect and what was going to happen and everyone has been extremely polite and forthcoming with the whole process. Thank you for all the care along the process and I cannot wait for my full recovery.<//text>

I am happy because the surgery was beautiful and now I want to have my breasts done too. My tummy tuck scar is fading more than I thought it would and my stomach is so tight. Also, you will definitely need someone to help you in the after process, part of the reason it was so good was because my brother was caring for me.

The staff was extremely helpful and replied very quickly to all of my questions. I had a breast augmentation with implants and the results are amazing. Dr. Mowlavi was great at making sure I picked the correct implant size and I couldn't be happier. The post operative experience has been made much more comfortable with their help and medications.</Text>

<Review>I had a lower face and necklift done by Dr.Mowlavi last month - I had a lot of excess skin on my neck due to cancer surgery. That being said, I am very satisfied with the outcome of the procedure, and am very grateful to Dr.Mowlavi and his staff for making my pre-and post-operative care seamless and relaxed. His entire office staff was very down to earth and was accommodating. I would highly recommend Dr.Mowlavi to anyone in the future.<//Review>< Resp>

Dr Mowlavi is so much more than JUST a plastic surgeon. He has to be one of the most educated Drs I have had the pleasure of meeting. That says alot if you knew how many doctors and specialists Ive encountered. He is also a perfectionists and it absolutely shows on every body he performs his magic on. Never have I had a doctor who actually responded to a genetics discussion and with knowledge on BII AND BIA-ALCL. Usually a doctor will redirect the convo but not Dr Mowlavi he knew EXACTLY what I was talking about and has even written papers on it. I have NEVER felt so confident in a doctor EVER!! Losing your girlie parts is not an easy thing both physically and psychologically. But now seeing what can be done with the aftermath I am excited for a new healthy lease on life. He is doing so much more than making people look gorgeous. Hes giving people their lives back.<//text>

5 stars to Dr. Mowlavi and his care team. I was welcomed straight from the beginning, as I was first nervous looking for a Doctor, but once I met Dr. Mowlavi, I knew it was a great fit. Having a mole removed from my face was definitely a procedure I wanted to go right, and I felt Dr. Mowlavi would deliver. I am so happy with my results and I look great. I have already recommended family and friends to the office, as I know they will be in great hands. Thank you!<//review>

< Review>
I loved the staff at Dr. Laguna's office! Everyone was super available and got to me immediately with any questions I had. I was an out of town patient and they were incredibly helpful with scheduling travel time and hotel accommodations as well. First time I saw Dr. Laguna was through instagram and then meeting him in person was amazing. He's super personable and caring and made me feel comfortable the whole way! The surgery went great, the whole OR was supsr professional and the aftercare care at Camilla's cottage was an amazing touch. I could not be happier with this experience and reccomend Dr. Mowlavi to everyone!< /Review>

Dr. Mowlavi is the most amazing plastic surgeon in Southern California, and I would highly recommend him to anyone who desires their dream body!<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I loved the staff at Dr. Laguna's office! Everyone was super available and got to me immediately with any questions I had. I was an out of town patient and they were incredibly helpful with scheduling travel time and hotel accommodations as well. First time I saw Dr. Laguna was through instagram and then meeting him in person was amazing. He's super personable and caring and made me feel comfortable the whole way! The surgery went great, the whole OR was supsr professional and the aftercare care at Camilla's cottage was an amazing touch. I could not be happier with this experience and reccomend Dr. Mowlavi to everyone!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1580334543817, 'text': 'My staff and I are happy to have served you!'}<//response><gmapID>0x80dce55ba4bac5f5:0x1a63c36560207580</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My experience with Dr. Mowlavi and his entire staff was incredible. Having full body surgery was a big decision but I had been thinking about it for so long, and when I met Dr. Mowlavi, I knew he was the surgeon to give me the results I wanted. His work is beautiful and even a week out, I can already feel and see the difference. The recovery process has been alright, but has definitely toned down after a week, so I am excited to be up and running back to normal in a couple weeks. I highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi and his team, from the front to the back office, James, and of course the masseuses. The massages have been amazing and necessary to work and smooth everything out, but I am happy with my results and how smooth and fit I am. Dr. Mowlavi has transformed me and sculpted my body, and I highly recommend him to anyone searching for the top liposuction and BBL surgeon. Thank you!< /review>

Dr. Mowlavi is a miracle worker! I loved Dr. Mowlavi’s energy and personality from the beginning. Thank you so much to the team as well for all of the care during my process! I look incredible and am so excited for my final results in the coming month. Even seeing my results from his post on Instagram had me amazed. I am currently 6 weeks out, and back to working out. My overall recovery so far has been pretty smooth, but I have been eager to going hard at the gym as of recent. I am so happy with my results, from my tummy tuck, liposuction of my front and back side, my breast lift revision, and of course my BBL. I recommend Dr. Mowlavi to all and any looking for top results.<//Review>

I had a breast reduction with Dr. Mowlavi. He and his staff walked me through everything and were very caring. They took their time with me and made me feel very comfortable throughout the whole thing. I am very happy with my results and the scarring is barely noticeable and well hidden. I would recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone!<//Review>

I am totally satisfied with the results of my recent neck and face  lift and upper eyelid lift performed by the highly competent Dr  Arian Mowlavi.  I couldn't have been in better hands! I have already recommended him to several of my close fiends. I am certain to have any further procedures done by him and his talented and caring staff!< /text>

I had a breast implant revision with Dr. Mowlavi. He was amazing and answered all my questions. He made sure I picked the best size implants and the recovery was very smooth! The office was very prompt and available whenever I needed anything. I will definitely be back for future procedures and recommend Dr. Mowlavi to everyone!< /Review>

<review>This doctor is absolutely unprofessional and rude. The pricing of procedures varies each visit. I wanted to do a breast reduction so I made an appointment when he convinced me to do a mommy makeover (breast reduction and tummy tuck) which I later decided not to do both surgeries at the same time. A few months after my consultation--where they followed up with me and asked me to come back. I was informed the price is subject to increase--apparently, the price of two procedures is the same as just one of them. I was told by the patient coordinator to tell the doctor the price I wanted to pay for the procedure, when I attempted to do so the doctor responded by saying verbatim “ I don’t want patients in my office who can’t afford me" and very disrespectfully walked out of exam room. His patient coordinator, Claudia, who was present at the time was even visibly shocked by his behavior, as was my daughter who was also present. I spent the rest of the afternoon feeling literally sick from how bad I was treated. I advise finding a more professional surgeon with better manners.<//review>< Pics>

I felt very secure and confident from the moment that I met Dr. Mowlavi. I always have great instincts when meeting people, and it is safe to say that I was right about Dr. Mowlavi. He was very confident, reassuring, and an exceptionally skilled surgeon who really cares about his patients. I read online reviews from all doctors before choosing Dr. Mowlavi, and I am very pleased that I did. I am thankful to have received care from him and his team. I followed all of his advice for post-operative recovery, and I am now completely back to normal after only one week! Clearly I made the right decision, and I will highly recommend him to anybody who needs a plastic surgeon.</review>

Dr. Mowlavi is a perfectionist. He did a wonderful job with my body and I am so happy with my results. I had my inner thigh mini lift, j plasma skin tightening all over my body, front and back, and a reverse mini tummy tuck. This was a revision surgery as a previous doctor botched my back, and arms in Irvine with Athenix, and I recommend no one to go there. Thank you to Dr. Mowlavi to fixing me up and making me so happy. I highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi and his team, also Theresa gives me such amazing massages. My post op care has been phenomenal and I am so happy I found the right Doctor.<//review>

I love these guys. Fantastic office, the doctor is very warm and puts you at ease. He doesn't push unnecessary treatments, and really looks out for his patients best interests. I've been getting Botox and fillers from him for a while, his procedures always come out looking natural, I never look over done. I would never hesitate to recommend him!</text>

It was a simple process to get me scheduled ASAP, and worked with me on pricing, gave me clear instructions for pre- and post-op, and my results were amazing! I am sooo happy to have made the decision to come here. My follow-up appointments were amazing, and I never had any pain throughout the entire process. Everything was spectacular, and I have recommended him to everyone!< /Review>< Pictures>

I had a benign tumor on my neck that I kept cutting when shaving my face. I had it removed surgically two years previous but it had come back. I came to Dr. Mowlavi and he surprised me and cut if off so I could shave again without hair sticking out. What was especially nice was that the pathologist was in the operating room so he was able to look at the benign tumor right away. I am so stoked about how it looks and show it off to my other doctors who are equally impressed. I'm very happy with the level of assistance with everyone - front office, nurses, people in the back. The doctor is very caring. I would recommend him to anyone who is a little needle shy. He has the touch.< /text>

<Text>I can say that Dr. Mowalvi has made me very happy. There is a lot of talk about a doctor, let alone a plastic surgeon, needing an artistic eye to be able to do what he does successfully. I did not buy it at first, but I can tell you right now that Dr. Mowlavi has the eye for it. My body is beautiful, proportionate, and I really am happy about my results. I had a tummy tuck, High Definition VASER liposuction of my back and front, and also a BBL. I am so excited for my final results and I definitely have Dr. Mowlavi and his team to thank, from the girls at the front to James, and of course the masseuses. They have made this experience easy and comfortable, and although there is pain right after, I am healing. I am a week out and really starting to feel able again so I am excited for my full recovery in the coming months. I highly recommend, so thank you to the team!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Dr. Mowlavi is amazing! I came to him for my HD Liposuction procedure and could not be happier with the whole experience. Not only are the results amazing, he and his staff have made the whole journey as comfortable as possible. He is extremely caring and takes his time in your consultations to make sure you know everything about your procedure and what the process will entail. Dr. Mowlavi is truly an artist and clearly knows what he's talking about in regards to the ideal body aesthetic. His post-care team including the masseuses have been incredible as well. I will definitely be recommending Dr. Mowlavi to everyone!</Review>

<Date>1569437347523</Date><rating>5<//rating><text>From the start, I was a little nervous about getting surgery, but then I met Dr. Mowlavi at my consultation at his office. He really comforted me and explained all that comes with the surgery. I talked to Claudia as well as the rest of the staff and they were all very welcoming. I had two prior smart lipo procedures that did not give me any of the definition I wanted, they were minimal results, so  I was skeptical. I was happy with my meeting and Dr. Mowlavi’s posted work, so I went ahead and committed.
I was nervous but I went onto the operating table, and when I woke up, I saw the light. I had a changed body to perfection. Dr. Mowlavi showed me my before and after video, after a few of my massages, and I could not believe it. Also, Polly has been an amazing massage therapist, so that has helped as well. I am currently one week out and as expected I am sore with slight discomfort, but i am healing, better and better each day. I would definitely recommend anyone to Dr. Mowlavi for a cosmetic surgery.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>To be honest, I am really glad it is over, it was a bigger recovery than I expected, but well worth it. The massages are fabulous, and really so helpful. Thank you to Dr. Mowlavi and the wonderful staff, I can tell already it is an improvement and I cannot wait to see the final results for my body. Thank you Dr. Mowlavi!

I had a lower facial lift, with neck, and loved the results!   Dr. Mowlavi and his staff prepare you completely during pre op, with all types of important information for proper healing and recovery, and following surgery the follow ups are timely and pleasant.  Dr. Mowlavi did an amazing job.  Not one of my friends, who didn't know of the surgery, could tell I had just had one.  That was the ultimate compliment.  My skin looks much younger, without looking pulled.  I look natural and definitely 10 years younger. I am very pleased.</Review>

I was very happy with Dr. Mowlavi, and I had a great experience at his practice. I was very impressed with his skills as a surgeon, and I found his needling for pain to be extremely painless. Moreover, the stitch removal was also very quick and painless. The staff were very professional as well, and the wait times were very short. James was also present with Dr. Mowlavi, and did a great job during the surgery as well as post-operative care. Overall, I would recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone looking for a plastic surgeon!< /Review>

I was previously botched in my last cosmetic surgery. After seeing 6 other surgeons, I FINALLY found Dr. Mowlavi. He's a straight shooter and knows what he's talking about. He removed my Breast Implants due to my Breast Implant Illness. Two days after his surgery, I was completely healed and I no longer had any pain. James and Polly have made the experience here an A++. Their receptionist RJ is extremely welcoming and the whole experience was amazing. I would recommend Dr. Mowlavi and his staff to anyone.<//review>

I had a face and neck lift done by Dr. Mowlavi and I am beyond speechless at my results! I was able to go back to work just after 8 days! I look great and I can’t stop taking selfies. From my consultation to my post op appointments, Dr. Mowlavi, James, Claudia, and the rest of his staff were beyond wonderful. Dr. Mowlavi is caring, thoughtful, and extremely talented. Him and his staff made sure everything went smoothly before, during, and after my surgery. If you are looking to have plastic surgery done, I wholeheartedly recommend you to do it with Dr. Mowlavi. Now I look young and feel great and it is all thanks to this office!</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I was referred to Dr. Mowlavi for corrective surgery due to a health issue and was a little scared about the procedure and outcome.  Dr. Mowlavi quickly put me at ease with his kind and reassuring spirit. His need for perfection in all he does is reflected through his amazing work. Each member of his team is every bit as kind and professional as he is making office visits a pleasure.  I'm thankful that I was able to become part of the Mowlavi family and highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Dr. Mowlavi is OUTSTANDING!  I was searching for a doctor that could complete a liposuction procedure and instead I found an artist to complete a Vaser HD liposuction!  The entire team made the pre-op and more importantly the post-op procedure exceptional.  Claudia explained the steps very clearly and was available each time I had a question and needed an answer.  James & Jason were helpful in making the operation room experience comfortable and Carol with her staff at Camilla's Cottage helped care for me for the first day post surgery.  Finally Polly was exceptional with the continued massages in making me comfortable and look great!  I am ever so grateful for how Dr. Mowlavi and his team made me feel confident about going to the beach again wanting people to look at me.  If you are considering some level of face or body improvement look no more than Dr. Mowlavi.  You will not be disappointed!< /Review>

Dr.Mowlavi is seriously the best surgeon I have ever met. He takes his time with you, listens to all your needs/wants, and best bed side manner I’ve ever experienced. All of his staff are amazing as well I am so happy I found Dr.Mowlavi and will definitely be coming back and spreading his name around to all.
Thanks so much,

<Text>I met the Dr through a friend and basically felt totally comfortable right away.. the staff was very friendly and kind .. My only complaint would be the wait time past the scheduled appointment time.
Now into the procedure I had done which was called cooling helium plasma rejuvenation. This was scary to me at first I mean it's my face let's be real. However Dr made me feel so at ease along side his assistants etc so I decided to go for it, I had awful skin I felt. The results compared to the recovery is amazing. It was not easy but the very much worth it I get many compliments and it's only been 6 weeks ..i am excited the results and am willing to share this with anyone who might have questions .. I absolutely would recommend this to anyone wanting to look and feel amazing like I do and absolutely recommend Dr. MOWLAVI</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

On 5/5 I had a Tummy Tuck done and a little fixing to my breasts due to a breast reduction done by another doctor that did a chop job. I was so scared because this was going to be such a big procedure but every time I went into the office Dr. Mowlavi would just get me so hyped I couldn't wait to get it done & see the end results. Now that I'm 4mo out I feel great and can finally wear cuter clothes and feel confidant on how I look instead of always trying to cover up. I know I could do a little more nips & tucks.. but when I do, I will definitely go back to Dr. Mowlavi and staff (James P.A he's awesome)! Thank You.< /review>

Recently, My wife had been experiencing pain to her upper left breast area.  We began the long trail of solutions through our HMO which ultimately ended us landing with Dr. Mowlavi.  On our initial consult with Dr. M,  I was immediately struck by his bedside manner, and friendliness.   His confidence in solving our problem was very comforting.  We immediately determined that a cosmetic tune up was needed, which ultimately ended up fixing the pain problem with a surgery.   Dr. M was so accommodating to my wife as a patient, that he provided his personal cell phone number to us, and at one point in recovery made a special appointment with us on his day off so we could address some post operative pain.    This is just something that is not heard of in today's medical practice climate.  He took the time to treat her, and did it with compassion.   A ++++

Dr Mowlavi is the best! Everything with the appointment was easy. He was prompt and very professional for my Botox treatment. The staff are also so friendly and helpful and I felt like they cared. I'm sure with Botox they could be annoyed and treat me just like another number but they were very kind.

He has great bedside manner. Very caring. The overall experience was smooth. I feel wonderful after!</Review>

I usually get 25 units of botox and that is more than enough... went for the first time to this place. The doctor recommended 50 units... i still have wrinkles in all the areas he said he would fix... 50 units later and not much change. . Plus i waited for ever. I am going back to my regular doctor... .. bad experience!<//text>

<Text>From the initial consultation to the post operative follow ups, the doctor and staff were attentive and made me feel like I was their only client. Dr. Mowlavi has been professional, kind, caring, and compassionate, everything I needed in this very personal and intimate procedure. He sets realistic expectations and did exactly as he said he would. This has been by far the most pleasant experience-ever! If you're looking for a talented surgeon, Dr. Mowlavi, James and Claudia are the best! Thank you for giving me my liife back, Dr. Mowlavi. Having you as my surgeon was the best decision of my life.< /Text>< Name>

<review>I recently had surgery that I am extremely happy with! I had a breast augmentation, lipo of the inner thighs arms stomach and back and also fat grafting. I am very happy with my breast implants and the sizing the Doctor helped me pick out that was perfect for my body shape. My husband is in the United States Marine Corps and this was a big push for the end of the year Marine Ball where the ladies can get all dolled up and honor their men. I have never felt so beautiful and self confident like I did that night! What I am most happy with is the fat grafting to the buttocks. I now feel so powerful when I slip on jeans or the tight black dress. Dr. Mowlavi is excellent and a perfectionist. He certainly made me feel beautiful and heard all my issues before going into surgery. I am terrified getting up under before surgery but James and Monica looked me in the eyes rubbed my head and said everything will be just fine. I really felt cared for! The rest of the staff has been AWESOME too! Let's just say Dr Mowlavi is my go to! I am a VERY HAPPY patient!<//review>< pictures>

Dr. Mowlavi performed an upper blepharoplasty and fat transfer to correct a scar on my eye. I am very pleased with the results. No more upper eyelids sagging onto my eyelashes! Dr. Mowlavi and his entire team were wonderful. Claudia, the patient coordinator, was helpful in answering any questions I had and thoroughly explained pre-op and post-op instructions. Cammie and Mimi at the front desk were courteous and efficient and were prompt in returning calls. Dr. Mowlavi and James (surgical tech)  genuinely cared about my treatment. Dr. Mowlavi is a very skilled and professional plastic surgeon. Overall, I had a great experience and would highly recommend him.< /review>

<review>I had a lower body lift, brachioplasty, breast lift and augmentation after losing 150 lbs. I consulted with 2 other plastic surgeons before I met with him, and they made me feel like just another piece of meat to cut. Dr. Mowlavi has his heart in his practice and it shows! He came highly recommended from one of my best friends who is a operating room surgical nurse assistant, she has worked with all of the cosmetic surgeons in the area, and told me he would be the only one she would ever go to. From my first meeting, I knew he was the only choice for me! Going to Dr. Mowlavi was the best decision I ever made...he truly cares about each and every patient.  He changed my life and I am truly grateful!< /review>< Date>

He really takes care of you, he really is professional, he is very delicate in everything he does and he does EXACTLY what you tell him to do. He is very welcoming, he wants to help you, I had breast cancer and he helped restore my breasts, and I felt very reassured. I recommend him to everybody to come to see him. The office (both laguna and newport) are really nice.

I also had my nose done, he did a realyl really good job. It looks EXACTLY like i wanted, it looks really natural. I have seem some really horrible nose jobs, but mine came out really professional and I am very happy!</text>

I'm thankful my primary care doctor referred me to Dr. Molavi for a breast reduction.
The surgery helped me to have more movement & flexibility in my neck which was desperately needed.  I can now drive and look to the left without having to turn my whole body to see traffic. And I feel more comfortable in my skin & more open.
Dr. Molavi treats you like you're part of his family. He's very thorough, kind & even though he is very busy, will take the time to answer all your questions.
I recommend him highly for any cosmetic surgery you may need!
Thank You Dr. Molavi!< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Mowlavi and his entire team are amazing! From when I first arrived in his office the staff was very welcoming and I felt like I was going to be in good hands. Dr. Mowlavi spent time with me to talk about exactly what I wanted and how I wanted it to look. It was really refreshing to have a doctor who really cared. He has a great eye and will offer exactly what is appropriate for you. In my case I wanted Botox and he recommended it in the areas that would make me look most natural and it turned out great. I will be going back. Thank you Dr. Mowlavi!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

My experience with Dr. Mowlavi, caring for my mother, was very positive.  He skillfully removed cancer and reconstructed facial and scalp areas with amazing results. He treats us like family and has our full trust in his care.  Dr. Mowlavi takes time to answer questions and explain things, reassuring and supportive.  I highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone in need of plastic surgery.< /Review>

<Text>I am a 56-year-old woman with 1 child who I breast fed, 34 C, no volume. I am fit and work out about 4-5 days a week.  I found Dr. Mowlavi on Real Self while researching breast augmentation.  I had already been on several consultations with doctors wanting to perform the surgery in different ways, it was a bit confusing.  I scheduled a consult and upon arriving I found the office to be beautiful and clean, the office staff was very nice and offered me something to drink while I waited.  Dr. M came in and introduced himself, he is so nice and personable, we talked for a little bit about what I was looking for and I was adamant about not getting a breast lift. Once he examined me, he suggested I get the lift and didn’t think I would be happy with only implants as my breasts would still be saggy only larger.  My concern was the scaring, he showed me pictures and assured me, with his technique, the scars would be minimal and not very visible. The quote I received with the lift, was the same price the other doctors gave for just the augmentation.  We also talked about my stomach, it was flat but the skin was saggy, for just a little bit more money, he suggested a mini tummy tuck.

Because he made me feel so comfortable, I made the decision to go with him.  We decided on 405 cc’s which puts me now at about a 34 D.  It’s been a little over a year and I can’t tell you how happy I am with his work.  My breasts look very natural, no one would know I had implants.  The scaring is so minimal and the way he placed my breasts, you can’t even see the scars head on, no scaring at all, around my areola.  My stomach is flat, I feel comfortable wearing a bikini and I look amazing!

I just went back last week as I had some fat on the inside of my knees that I just couldn’t get rid of, he gave me a great price on liposuction so I scheduled for the following week. It only took about 25 minutes and the fat is gone.  It’s been a week and I barely have any bruising…they look amazing and they are even still a bit swollen.

I don’t typically write many reviews but felt compelled to do so for Dr. Mowlavi as he is such an amazing doctor and just an all-around nice person.  When I’m ready for that face lift, I’ll be going back!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Before I found Dr. Mowlavi I had actually gone to another doctor he was very unprofessional and rude. THANK GOODNESS I found this doctor. Not only was I able to get my confidence up but I was also able to finance my own surgery and pay it all by myself. I got the implants instead of the fat transfer because I did not have enough fat to give me the volume that I wanted if this is you then go to Dr. Mowlavi. I actually went to his location in Laguna Beach and have nothing but good things to say about him and his staff they treated me like if I was family and I felt VERY SAFE under their care. Thank YOU GUYS FOR EVERYTHING. Dr. Mowlavi is truly an artist :) If your still unsure about this procedure just go to a consultation he is very friendly and sweet. Always willing to answer any questions and concerns. Special Thank you to Claudia and James for all the support as well through out the whole process.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Dr Mowlavi performed a lift as well as a smaller implant exchange, and I could not be happier with the results!! They are EXACTLY what I wanted. While I was unsure about which size implant I should go with, Dr Mowlavi assured me he would make me look proportionate to my body type, and he did exactly that. His patient care coordinator Claudia was absolutely wonderful as well! She provided me with her personal cell phone for any and questions, concerns, etc. I reached out to her multiple times, and got a response within the hour. If for some reason she could not, she made sure one of the staff got in touch ASAP. Like most people, I was quite nervous, but she made me feel so much better! At times we did have to wait a tad longer than scheduled appointment time, however I actually found this reassuring. He has many patients who trust him and his team, and that to me is MUCH more important. I will DEFINITELY recommend Dr Mowlavi to anyone looking to make any cosmetic changes. :)<//Text>

From the first time we walked in Dr Mowlavi the staff treat you like family and with dignity, they dont over talk you. I remember for my first surgery he stroked my arm when I went to sleep, he was very comforting and has fantastic bed side manner. When i was in a wheel chair he was one of the few doctors who actually talked to ME and not above me to my family instead. After I had a gastric bypas I lost 500 lbs and I have had multiple surgeries to remove my excess skin including a panniculetomy, and he removed 4.5 lbs off of each side of my thighs. I am going to have my arms done and my inner thighs.

I would highly reccomend him to anyone. He doesnt treat you like a patient, he treats you like family</Text>

Dr. Mowlavi has never disappointed. The results of procedures have been always complete. For my skin cancer removal I have never has to revisit with additional appointment. The resident pathologist who immediately performs and finds lab results, gives extra confidence in the processes Dr. Mowlavi uses. There was one procedure that sometimes work for keloids, were reduced, but I was particularly sensitive and he didn't want do do more injections. The result is the keloids are much flatter.

I want you to consider the following:

Today I was in for a Melanoma extraction of tissue on my right fore arm. Dr. Mowlavi's surgical procedure was, except for a slight sting of the needle. I didn't feel the process at all. The after care with staff assisting is friendly and competent. I'm honored to be asked to write about my experience.</Review>

I have always had wonderful experiences with Dr. Mowlavi and his staff. I had a reconstruction after a bad construction many years ago after going through breast cancer. After Dr Mowlavi reconstructed my right breast and added an implant to my left breast, I now have two very even breasts and a cleavage. I can definetely recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone needing and wanting cosmetic surgery 100%.< /text>

This was a total circus.  My friend and I bought a voucher on Living Social for Botox for 20 units.  I knew I would need more and inquired.  The receptionist told us his cash price per unit.  It was really good.  Upon arrival at the office, we had to park down the street because the lots were so full at this one office building.  The reception area was packed.  Should have been a good sign, right? Wrong.  Not only did we wait for about 30 minutes for our appointment (only the doctor's time is valuable), then we were called into the treatment room and waited some more.  When he came in, we had a couple of questions and he tried to sell us a lot of other things.  "Try it for free" he says.  Then he disappears again and goes on to other patients.  He also said his cash price was more than we were originally told. But I still asked for 55 units based on HIS assessment.  This is 15 more than I usually get.  After another hour or so, we got our botox, paid and left.
A month and a half later, I have deep wrinkles in my foreheard. (It should last at least 6 months).  I called to tell them it didn't work correctly, that he maybe watered it down too much. He said that I metabolized it too much so it was my fault.  hmmmm....I've been getting Botox for over 10 years and suddenly, with my slowing metabolism now that I'm over 50, I'm processing Botox differently.  Interesting.  He refused to fix it.  It probably would have taken 10 units.
This doctor acts really nice, but is just a scam artist.  I would never trust him to touch my face again.  BE WARNED!< /Text>

Dr. Mowlavi - I had a wonderful experience! The thing I really liked about him is that he wasn't a stick in the mud, sometimes doctors seem like they don't have time to be personal with the patient, but Dr. Mowlavi was personal, friendly, generous and down to earth with me. That is what I really enjoyed about him, he made me feel very comfortable, and I really enjoyed, and I am very happy that he is my surgeon.

As far as my procedure is concerned I feel that before I had the procedure Claudia and Erika made me feel really comfortable and answered all my questions. They were always there to answer my questions before my procedure. When I was preparing for my procedure I was really nervous but the Staff at Orange Coast Memorial Hospital was really great too. The anesthesiologist and nurse were really awesome. When they took me in for the procedure the anesthesiologist really did her job, all I remember is looking up at the ceiling and that was it, I was in the recovery room all done. It was a little painful in the recovery room, Nurse Sae was awesome and took care of the pain. I felt good.

After my surgery when I was bandaged up I felt good. My pain tolerance is high, I did pretty good with it, and took a few of my pain pills. After less than a week I was no longer in pain, didn't have to take any pills, and I was very satisfied.

In my post operative appointment they changed all my bandages and everything and I am VERY VERY satisfied. I am happy with my new figure and the new me! I feel so light, almost 100lbs lighter! I can't wait to wear my cute Victoria Secret bras (That I have never been ever to wear before!!!).

Dr. Mowlavi is awesome and fantastic. He has made me feel really good at my age. I am an older woman, but I feel very very young. I would definitely refer all my friends to Dr. Mowlavi for their breast surgeries, tummy tucks and cosmetic procedures. His wife is  a very luck woman!!.</Text>

< Review>
I appreciate the knowledge of the young man who assisted me and the special testing to inform me about the structure of my feet and what kind of shoes I should wear. He called another store for my size and in the end he had to have it special ordered for me. I am anxiously awaiting my for my new shoes! I also appreciate the appointment system! You've made a customer for life! One last comment, I overheard two other customers who took advantage of the knowledge and time of the sales people, but in the end said they could buy cheaper online. To those 2 customers, you have to be willing to pay for the technology and service. No one is helping you online or testing your foot structure and function to give you the best fitting shoes for comfort, performance and safety. Sure, online can be quick and cheap, but if all people do is waste the time of brick and mortar businesses and then buy online, how long will businesses be able to stay in business? And along with closing the business goes how many jobs? Then how will people pay their bills? We must learn to think beyond the $. I support small business! Thank you and God bless Fleet Feet!</Review>

But most importantly, it's got good people who are knowledgable, sincere and supportive, and take time to support you regardless of where you are or your goals. I know I'll never be a serious runner, but I felt so good talking to the people there and they made me feel good about my personal goals and reaching them.  I'm really happy to have found them, and I've got my new running/shoe store for as long as I live anywhere even remotely nearby.< /Review>< Pictures>

I visited this location based on a referral as I was told that it catered to the needs of individuals who had foot problems and needed to be fitted with special athletic footwear. Please note that this isn't a regular sporting goos store which simply sells sneakers. If you require special sneakers that would fit the contours of your foot or walking style, this is definitely the place to visit. However, please bare in mind that that they cater to those who are flat-footed, those who place excess pressure on their heels or on the balls of your feet or otherwise when walking then this is definitely the place to visit. They do complete scans of your feet and walking styles before you're fitted with your type of shoe by a specialist. Be prepared to spend a minimum of $150.00 depending on your condition. However, you'd be pleased with the results!<//text>

<Text>It was my first time stopping by Fleet Feet, and I was really impressed by the level of analysis and help that I got at the shop, and came away with a lot of great new information. As someone who's been running for two decades, that's a pretty impressive feet feat.

Fleet Feet Burbank has absolutely stellar customer service that helped me find the best shoes and insoles for running. Alex specifically was an absolute joy to speak to as he helped me try on all of the different options. Having been recommended to Fleet Feet by a friend, I would be thrilled to recommend this store to anyone looking for running gear!<//review>

<Text>I can't imagine shopping for running shoes anywhere else. The staff at Fleet Feet is so great - extremely knowledgeable and always super helpful with finding the best shoe and getting the right fit. And they have a 60 exchange policy so you really can't go wrong. Some things are really improved by the in-person shopping experience and this is one of them.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c29560da8e7b97:0x7773accfe2680615<//gmap_id>< Time>

<text>Always a great experience here! Salesperson always takes their time giving you their undivided attention. Friendly and engaged. I appreciate a h salesperson's knowledge and thorough explanations of recommendations. They do a 3-D scan of your feet and watch you walk to get an understanding of where/how your feet pressure is applied. They review and talk you through the results and then talk you through each shoe selection as you try them on. I never leave here feeling like I spent too much or got cheated. Great selection and great service.<//text><userid>102997303451512159135<//userid>< response>

I love this place, not only is their analysis of your feet unlike anything I've experienced, but the people working there are passionate about every aspect of being an active person and the experience they provide makes me keep going back. They are patient, friendly, encouraging and are truly looking to make sure you walk out with the best option you're comfortable with, both in price and fit. Also I went in telling them I needed my 1st pair of running shoes and experience tightening in my calves often and they gave me tips to stretch out and warm up my muscles before and after my runs! The staff at Burbank Fleet Feet can't get any better! Also they are taking all the right precautions for themselves and customers keeping the store clean, staying on top of social distancing and when needed asking customers to wait outside as it is a small location. I am always recommending Fleet Feet to my new and old runner friends.<//Text>

Walked in and got help right away. Tho helped me named Rachel was amazing. I told her I needed some inserts for my shoes because the orthotics that I had were causing blisters on my feet. She knew immediately what I needed. I got a new set of inserts and it was so simple and easy. She helped me with so many things and explained how my shoes, socks, and inserts were causing blisters. Extremely happy and I will go back to get some more stuff.< /review>

This was my first visit to your store.  A couple of my friends who are runners recommended your store.  I love the machine that generates an image of my foot which helped narrow down the best fit/shoe for me.  Rachel assisted me and she was so kind and patient.  She took her time with me to help me understand the “whys”’ of the shoe recommendations she pulled for me.  Thank you for providing a wonderful experience.  I will definitely be back !!!< /text>

<text>I was SO lucky to have JC as my sales associate. I was looking at the completely wrong shoe. He asked why I stopped running and what shoe I loved that kept me running . They were gel Kayano 19s. RIGHT AWAY he told me I needed a light stability shoe and had me try on a BROOKS adrenaline GTS 21 that fit all my criteria- provides stability, wide at the toe box and light weight! He went above and beyond to measure my feet (I now know I’m a men’s width on the right and women’s width in the left). He had me up half a size and fit me for a great pair of running socks.He also taught me the runners knot. Overall a great experience and learned so many valuable tips!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Valerie at the Burbank location was awesome. Super quick and efficient while explaining everything fully to me and made it fun and easy. She was very knowledgeable and brought out three options that were all great. I love the ones I went with, but she nailed the choices. I have knee issues and flat feet so she explained why each option would be good for me based on those issues. She also pointed out I've been wearing a size too small for my running shoes. Well worth the visit and having experts fit you and find the best shoe for you. Good prices too, considering you know you're leaving with a great shoe that is catered to you.<//text><username>Amy Maestri</username><Resp>{'time': 1592338662509, 'text': 'Glad you had such a great visit to our store.

It was time to replace my running/training shoes and Ted at the Burbank location took great care of me and made some key recommendations that helped me decide on a pair of New Balance shoes. I love these shoes and will likely buy a second pair this Fall so I have two sets to use. My wife also bought a pair of ON walking shoes and they have worked out well for her. We had an excellent experience at Fleet Feet.< /text>

Love this place, I always recommend anyone to go here. I came here off a recommendation from my physical therapist and like how they do there best to find the right shoe depending on problems or preferences. They offer many items that help with relief and they do have a fun run every Sunday at the end of the month. Definitely will come back for my Brooks caldera shoes.<//Review>

I LOVE Fleet Feet Burbank!  With their equipment expertise and supportive coaching and trainings I've become a runner!! When my daughter's boyfriend signed up for his first 10k I took him to FF (he got fitted with the crazy-cool foot scanner) and now he's a fan too. They're the BEST!< /Text>

Not only was she fun and engaging - which shows she's actually listening, she's actually wishing to find what is best - she followed through with amazing recommendations.

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Since the COVID-19 lockdown, Fleet Feet Burbank shows how you can still get a personalized, wonderful shopping experience with a knowledgeable staff when it comes to buying a pair of running shoes.

It's important to come and get your feet tested on their state-of-the-art feet scanning machine, and then have their staff recommend the right pair of shoes for you. I always thought I needed balancing shoes, but based on the machine's data  and the lady who was helping me, I realized I need more neutral shoes, so I bought the New Balance 860s.< /text>< name>

I visited the Burbank store for a new pair of running shoes. Becky was very helpful and friendly.

They genuinely care about finding the right shoe for your needs. They do a 3D scan and watch you walk and talk about your lifestyle.

Great store! Knowledgeable, patient staff that help analyze, size, and recommend the best shoes not simply the popular or spendy styles! Fair pricing that goes beyond manufacturer requirements and equals the online guys.

I live west of the 405 and get all my running shoes at Fleet Feet Burbank.<//Review>

Great products available! Great service!

For anyone who runs and wants to stay healthy without injury, this is the store for you.

I shop at your store at the beginning of track season every year and for running shoes for me.

Thank you!< /review>

<Text>The best in-house running shoe selection of any shoe place I called and searched here in The Valley. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable, and efficient. I came in, talked for a minute about my known needs, she recommended some alternative options that I didn't list. I tried on three. I bought one. Boom. The perfect shopping experience, especially for something like running shoes that you NEED TO TRY ON.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1555013119232, 'text': 'Thanks Michael.

They recommended certain shoes, and had me step on this cool machine that analyzed my feet size, and a whole bunch of other stuff about my feet I never knew. They even emailed me the detailed report. Rachel then grabbed 3 pairs of shoes and I was able to make a decision after trying each one on. I can't recommend this place enough.< /review>< Pics>

Wonderful running shop! Dan got me in quickly, did a 3d scan of my feet, and brought out several shoes that fit well and matched my mission.
Weekly pub runs are a blast, and their weekly email newsletter is full of great info on prepping for races, upcoming demo events, and local stories- more like a fan community 'zine than a business advert.
I live west of the 405, but will be getting my running supplies from Fleet Feet Burbank now!<//Review>

My experience was very personal because my "shoe sherpa," Becky, was incredibly accommodating and knowledgable. I loved having my foot scanned and learning more about the physics of running. The shoes and gear are top of the line.< /text>

Best ever...again.  Well worth the price as the shoes will last for years and years to come.  See full review on the company website.  I don't feel like retyping it all over again but it was a fantastic experience and my wife and I got A+ service from Rachel and from size 14 pony tail smiley guy...sorry, I forgot your name!< /Review>

Becky was excellent which is exactly why I have returned a few times to purchase shoes from this store and from her directly!  As a small business owner I can appreciate incredible customer service and she has gone above and beyond our expectations and I have referred a few friends to her as well.</review>

Also, regarding the employees again, they actually went above and beyond to help me find the kind of shoes I wanted- color-wise (like, they brought out all the shoes of the brand/style I was looking at in my size just so I could see which colors I liked... that was super considerate and way more than they had to do for me).<//Review>< time>

I loved my experience at the Burbank, CA store! Dan took the time to really fit me for new shoes as  well as advising me on clothing and a few other items. He was able to do this while providing professional and attentive service to not just me but others who came in. Very knowledgable and I loved the foot scanner. So informative. I've already told others about my experience!< /text>

I LOVE everything about Fleet Feet. My husband and I never thought we would be runners until we joined the 5k Finish group and met all sorts of like-minded beginning runners. Now, we can't wait until our next run! While the products can be a bit pricey, they are all very high-quality.</text>

I had never had a professional fitting or analysis of my feet and Gate. I am a delivery driver so I am on my feet many hours a day. There have been days that I am on the verge of tears because my feet and legs hurt so badly while I am on deliveries. After visiting this store and purchasing shoes and inserts I can say that I still get a burn from the exercise but not a pain. I highly recommend this store as a spot for you to love your feet again. The selection is much larger than I expected. Don’t let the small size fool you.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1515450944922, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review, Ryan.

The folks at Fleet Feet are terrific. Their selection and pricing is on par with most specialized running shoe stores, but it's the service that's key here. They take have the tools and the expertise to really size your fit and present you with options, not just pushing for the most expensive shoes.< /review>

The first thing I love about Burbank Fleet Feet sports is their training programs. They are open for all levels of runners and walkers. Another great thing, is the staff is trained in really evaluating you for the best fitting shoe for you. You can get less expensive shoes elsewhere, but you're taking a chance on injury if they don't fit right. The best thing about Fleet Feet is Colin and his staff. They are always friendly and helpful and make you want to come back for the programs and merchandise.  And no, I wasn't paid for this review.  I just really love this place.<//Text>

<Review>Fleet Feet isn't just a running store. Its part of the community trying to gather those in the area together. They sell good quality products for reasonable prices.

To me, Fleet Feet Burbank is more than just a store, it is a community, a community I have been welcomed into and is now an important part of my life. I feel like more than just a customer, at Fleet Feet Burbank I'm part of the family. Fleet Feet Burbank provides an inclusive environment where any runner of any skill level can come in, receive friendly and helpful customer service, participate in trainings to improve their technique and reach goals they never thought they could, purchase quality and fun running shoes and accessories, and take part in running events where they can meet other runners who are happy to share stories, support and advice. I couldn't imagine going to any other store for my running needs, and I am thankful that I started my personal running journey with the wonderful people of Fleet Feet Burbank.<//Text>

There was lots of time spent with me figuring out what shoes worked best for me --- they must of had me try on 8 pairs shoes and they had Tons of patience with me. Becky even pointed out some great socks and with the socks & shoes it makes me feel like they were made for me. She also showed me the "runners loop" way to tie my laces so they fit even better.</text>

I've already recommended Fleet Feet Sports Burbank to a couple of co-workers. I liked that Fleet Feet actually measured my feet, watched me walk, and recommended walking shoes for me. She was able to size them right on and understand that I was narrow on one foot and standard on the other and that both were slightly pronated, more on one than the other. It took all of the guesswork out of buying shoes. I went in to buy one pair, but wound up buying two because both felt so comfortable on and supportive of my feet.</Text>

LOVE! Fleet Feet exceeded my expectations. As someone relatively new to running, my shoes/socks/sports bras had all been purchased online with little to no direction. Since I've kept with it, I figured investing in the proper equipment was the next step. I stumbled upon Fleet Feet and could not have had a better time. The employees are helpful, make you feel comfortable no matter your expertise level, and most importantly KNOW THEIR STUFF! I left with shoes, socks, and a sports bra and couldn't be happier with my choices. I was even informed of some local races they were involved in and told about/invited to the group runs they host weekly. I will be back and encourage everyone else to give them a shot.< /Text>

<Review>Staff could not possibly be friendlier or more helpful. I bought a pair of trail runners and then got worried they were a half size too small, so I brought them back in. The owner remeasured my feet and confirmed that I'm kind of between sizes and told me to try mine out for a week on the trails and bring them back for the next half size up if they're not working out. No extra charge. They earned a repeat customer for sure. This is why brick and mortar stores can still be so much better than online shopping, even if it seems like you're paying a couple dollars more up front.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Well at first I thought as a little put off by how few shoes there were and then I tried a few on and realized that all of the guesswork had been done. Every shoe I tried on was great! I really love my new balance 860 v7 and I would have never tried them on if they weren't in this curated selection- great shoe!!! Wore them today at Bootcamp and never thought about my shoes, except towards the end and that was because they felt so good!< /Text>< Pics>

I love to buy my running shoes here. Friendly service. Clean store. Many selections. They even knew my name, my size and preferred brand. I love the Brooks brand among others such as Saucony, Mizuno, and Asics. The Brooks brand sometimes hard to find, but this place has it.  They have a great selection for all types of runners. I have been loyal to this store for all of the above reasons.</text>

<text>Rebecca helped me when I came in to the store. She was truly AMAZING!!!! I had so many questions and she knew everything. She also educated me about what would be best for my body to prevent injury when running. She didn't try to upsell me on anything. I could tell that she truly wanted me to purchase the products I was comfortable with and that I really needed. I am training for my first 1/2 marathon, so I am very nervous. But, I am looking forward to letting her know I did it! It's in November, but I will be back many times before then to stock up on other needed items. I won't ever go anywhere else for my running needs. Fleet Feet and Rebecca are the best!!!</text><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

Great ladies n customer service but warning don't get your self locked into the place after hours unless your car is parked outside the gate cause you can walk out the gate but you won't be able to drive your car out the gate after it's locked up after the 10pm curfew ok but other than that very clean n respectful employees they're i love them they'll even work with you a little bit so long as you give them respect n say something ahead of time I've been they're 3 years and love the facility clean n cheery people</Review>

We have used Extra Space Storage at 750 S Sanderson, Hemet, several times over the last 5 years. We have always had great service. Samantha Kirby is a wonderful employee. Samantha has helped with us several times.  We have also worked with Honeylynn Ladner.  The quality of service, knowledge and response from them speaks volumes for the company.  Extra Space Storage is our choice for both short term and long term storage.  They are also the only place we'll recommend to anyone for storage needs.  Thanks again from Nick and Mary Gutierrez<//Review>

Samatha is really nice. She showed me a few units to see what fits my needs better. She explained everything I needed to know in order to rent a unit. If you are looking to rent storage space, I recommend extra space on Sanderson.< /Text>

I was always greeted with respect by all the staff, at the Hemet location on Sanderson Avenue. My continual stay to continue on as a tenant here, after three years of moving to Riverside; was a great choice. Although I had moved from the area, I did not want to take the chance with anyone else! I was and continue to be very comfortable knowing that I am well taken care of. Samantha and the staff there are awesome, and that keeps me traveling up and down the road; even though I could've chose a local company. I am well pleased with my stay, and I love listening to the "on the air" radio station that plays while I gather my belongings. I hope to continue on as a renter, and will refer family and friends! Thank you all for your hospitality! ❤️❤️❤️</review>

My experience with Samantha at your Sanderson Store was above and beyond exceptional. I felt completley comfortable making my decision to rent a unit from her. She was thurough with all of the details. Took me for a tour to see the unit available. She greeted me with a smile and answered all of my questions. I love the hours available and the first month free! I'm moving in right away to my unit! Thank you Extra Space for the service you offer....</Review>

Great place. Friendly service is hard to find these days. But, Honeylynn and Samantha in the front office, make it look easy. If you need storage or a parking space for your RV/trailer. I highly recommend extra space storage in Hemet.< /review>

<text>I wouldn’t even give them one star , they use scare tactics after a loved one dies. They threaten to hold all belongings, unless if you do what they say then they’ll bend the rules. SHADY !!!
Holes in the ceilings , water gets through and dusty units. $150 a month for a 8x10 (jail size)
Don’t recommend!!!
PS. Only gave a good review first time because they emailed me and asked me too, this was my mom’s unit . I took over after she passed from cancer</text><GmapID>0x80db65e96de03e41:0x14a55728da0f89e8<//GmapID>< Name>

Samantha and her employees have been a great help with my storage needs. Always friendly and helpful. I’ve been at this location since 7/29/2016. I highly recommend this location for your storage needs.

“Thanksgiving Day 2020”
I have had my belongings Stored in Many places over the past 30 years and I must say that Samantha & Honeylynn work hard to keep the facility up to date and very clean. They have assisted me in the proper size for my needs at the time. Very pleasant staff. If You have Storage needs then here is the place to go!
I highly recommend this Storage Facility!
“Happy Turkey Day!”

This is a very safe and secure place to keep your storage. HoneyLynn who represents extra space was very friendly , and who also  went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed for my stuff to be safe there at extra space. Would recommend them to anyone wanting a good place to put there storage.<//Text>

Daniel and Samantha were so nice and professional. They gave me an absolutely great customer service experience. The unit was also very clean but they insisted they clean it again to make it perfect. Thank you so much to Daniel and Sam. And the unit was originally 45 and they gave it to me for 30.< /Review>

I've been here with Extra space storage for over 4 yrs now. The staff here is awesome n always helpful. I appreciate that they take  the time to call me to let me know my rent is a few days late so I can avoid late fee. That helps me out so much , since I'm always so busy n forget sometimes. So thank u so much Honeylynn & Samantha . The storage lockers are safe n the grounds are nice n clean👍 Extra space storage is the Best place to be when you need a place to store your things.</Review>

<Text>I had my first major move today and it was so incredibly stressful and hectic. However, Extra Space Hemet made the "unloading" process so easy and smooth. Samantha helped me secure the unit I needed, reserved ahead of time and at a great price! I ended up needing more space so I reserved a unit the night before the move and had plenty of space for everything and the units were close together which was great!</Text><time>1495666177339<//time>< user>

We are new to this area & were looking for a storage unit.  Visited this location on Sanderson St. & we were pleased that this facility was very clean & organized.
The agent Samatha was very helpful & showed me which unit was available. She also helped us save money😁.</review>

<Text>I give this Extra Space Storage 5 stars because the facility was clean the minute manager was pleasant helpful we were there for probably about a year year-and-a-half we've been going to Extra Space Storage for a while we decided to move out because the prices were getting a little high they seem to want to raise the rent every 6 months for even long-term renters so we decided to pick a place that was a little more user-friendly a smaller mom and pop Place prices are a lot better<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I met Robert Schultz, the Assistant Manager first, than Samantha Kirby,the Manager than Daniel, their colleague. All of them were super friendly, patient, just "there for you" with kindness and advice....Couldn't have gotten better experience than what I had. I can only say and suggest to everybody who's looking for storage to go to Extra Space Storage in Hemet. All of them  work with you. I am really fond of them,what a great team!!!!!!!  xxxx<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Jingle Bells!  I recently got a space there and the customer service was outstanding. Michael Aunchman was the staff member who helped me.  He was on his lunch break when I arrived.  He immediately cut his lunch break and helped me.  He showed me multiple units to makes sure I was taken care.  This is the best storage company I have used.  They are not about the money.  They are about the customer.  I recommend them to everyone.<//Review>

< Review>
I highly recommend Daniel at this storage facility, my friend sal and I went in to obtain a unit there about 3 days ago. He was very polite, informative, patient, genuine and funny. Once sal and I figured out what size storage best suited him, Daniel went through the contract policy quiet quickly but made sure to point out important details about lawsuits and liability coverage. Once sal agreed to the terms and conditions I too was left with a warm a fuzzy good feeling. Not once did I feel like there was any fine print or hidden costs while acquiring a unit here. Keep up the good work Daniel.<//Review>
