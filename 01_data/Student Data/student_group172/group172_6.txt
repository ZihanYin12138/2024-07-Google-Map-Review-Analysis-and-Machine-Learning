<review>I CANNOT BELIEVE THE AUDACITY OF THIS PLACE! My husband and I stopped in for a quick COVID test back in November 2020 where they told us our insurance would cover it or we could pay out of pocket ~$100. Fast forward to this week, we received notice in the mail for $6900 EACH of claims they made to Kaiser for 12+ services we did NOT even receive. They are trying to bill us for antibody tests, injections, counseling, etc. We weren't even there for 5 minutes and we even administered the COVID tests OURSELVES outside! AND we had to call to receive our results and never got them in writing like we were promised.

I have tried to call them MULTIPLE times and have left MULTIPLE voice mails to their billing department with no response. I cannot believe this and see insurance fraud written ALL over this. I will be reporting them if this is not resolved in the next few days.

Long story short, AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!<//review>< Response>

I wish there was less than a one star rating I could give this place. I got 2 covid tests here, something I do quite frequently and normally costs me nothing. Not only did they give me and several others false positives, but now we are being charged thousands of dollars (no exaggeration) with a laundry list of services we did not receive. I believe there is something fraudulent happening here, if something similar has happened to you please get in touch with me, I’m seriously considering filing suit for these exploitative practices during the middle of a pandemic! F this place, never go here I beg of you.< /Text>

Awful, I’ve been trying to call for almost a week now to pay my bill.  I am unable to get anyone on the phone.  The number listed takes you to an automated recording with options, but whichever option you choose either takes you to dead air or nobody picks up.  I’ve left countless voicemails for the contact number listed on the invoice.  I’ve spoken to a third party for billing and they are unable to process a payment and unable to get in contact with anyone at this location.  I’m amazed at how unprofessional this establishment is.  I would not recommend this place.<//review>

<review>This place must be a scam during covid times. Two of us took tests, both have yet to get results a week later. Not in the system at all, when we were told 1-3 days.

Worst part is their phone goes straight to voicemail. Have called dozens of times, with different phones, from multiple people that have gotten tested there. No answer for 3 days straight. Nothing. Pathetic service all around.

Also, they do NOT follow HIPAA standards!!</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c33121312d7115:0x443e93ae2f8feeec<//gmapID></record>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Do NOT take your COVID test here. My girlfriend and I came in for a COVID test and it was great at first. The service was fast and the receptionist told me that the service was covered. 2 weeks later, both of our insurances had a claim for $2700 and $2200 on top of the (covered) COVID test. We didn't go past the receptionist or even saw a doctor. I tried calling their Billing department, but no one ever answers. I'm not familiar with the process, but either Dr. Jane Himmelvo or their Billing Department seems really shady.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Similar to others here, I took my wife in for a COVID test that resulted in over $3000 of charges.  As others noted, all attempts to contact Above Urgent went directly to voicemail. The only way we even got the test results was by driving over to the office and demanding them.

This place is clearly exploiting the pandemic and must be reported.  Contact the CA Attorney General's office to get information on filing a complaint.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Hands down the best urgent care. They’re fast, thorough, and always friendly. I made my appointment online through the Solv app, and was able to even change my appointment time because I got there faster than expected. When checking in, you’re handed a tablet to do all your paperwork which I prefer. I was in and out of there within 45 minutes. I highly suggest making an appointment or at least going in the morning as I know from past experiences they do get busy later in the day.</review>

They never answer the phones. I've literally called more than 10x times straight for 3 days and the call forwards to voicemail. This is an Urgent Care which means they should have a receptionist answering all incoming calls. Worst service.<//Review>

I’ve come here in the past when I was sick but after coming here from my baby on New Years Eve, I officially am so grateful for this urgent care. My poor baby was throwing up and had a terrible fever on New Years Eve . I took him to 3 other urgent cares and received the worst service. Sadly people are so desensitized and in compassionate, it’s heartbreaking. But fortunately I came here and Briana let me know that they were closing early but would help my baby as the last patient. I am so grateful for her and the entire staff who treated my baby and I with so much respect and compassion. He is now healing great. So I’d definitely recommend this urgent care.</Review>< Pics>

<review>I was seen quickly, unlike others Ive gone to. The reception staff and medical assistant were nice and smiled. The doctor, on the other hand, was rude, condescending, and never smiled once. He didn't tell me what was wrong with me. He just wrote me a script and kicked me to the curb. Glad I live out of state, so I'll never have to see him again.</review>< name>

Everyone is so nice and compassionate , especially with my not so cooperative 5 yr old who is terrified of anything and everything in a doctors office .. all the staff really went above and beyond to make the visit easier for her.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x80c33121312d7115:0x443e93ae2f8feeec< /Gmap_id>< date>

<Review>Super fast just seeing if you use apps to make an appointment and check in also instead of making you fill out the forms by hand and worried about if your handwriting is legible or not they give you a to fill your forms out with all the bass are very courteous and polite the nurses were very gentle and considerate and you hate getting shots like I do then then you'll be pleased to know that they are very good I'm getting shots as well I made sure there was a painless as possible<//Review><Response>{'time': 1570643221225, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words.

We pride ourselves on getting complete medical information before we can make the best diagnosis.  Sometimes this means labs or imaging.  We do have to ask if you want these test before we do them when you are a cash patient because we do not want you to be surprise by the costs.  You always have the option to not perform the tests but your diagnosis might not be complete.  To elaborate on refills..we are an Urgent Care Center.  For refills you will have to go to someone that will follow up to see if you still need certain medication or tests.

These people charge you $120 to see a "doctor" then they give you half of a diagnosis.  Then they say you need more tests.  Then another person comes in and asks you for more money, then you have to pay them to get the tests and diagnosis.  Then they under prescribe your medicine, I believe this is done on purpose.  They refuse to give refills.  This forces you to go back and pay them another $120 for a "fallow up" in order to get better.  They are scammers.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Really high quality noodle spot, probably the best I've had in Roseville. I've had the Veg Maze Ramen twice and have been really impressed both times. The noodles are perfectly cooked, veg is fresh, portion is large, and the spicy sesame garlic oil they use on the noodles is delicious. I add tofu as well. Interior is very sleek and clean and staff are nice. Vegetarian broth would be a nice add to the menu, and their seasoned egg didn't have strong flavor or a soft yolk when I had it last, but otherwise a must try restaurant.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORetsaABSeSSM07KomgH3HqCWr2LjUKNsNXhFc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMa_jTk9HYWhAGf0ZOLl8eHtgoZPBHBuSxwFC6x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x809b21891d306abf:0xe217338b3221797a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Had a wonderful experience here. Great customer service and great food. However one thing: when we waiting at the front, the light was point straight in my eyes. And there is no other waiting area in the restaurant. But other than that, it was a very nice experience. I love their curry rice, ordered a ramen too but not my favorite at this place. Will definitely come back again try some other stuff and highly recommended.< /review>

I would say go earlier to receive the freshest food.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

The decor is nice, but the order was wrong. I had to convince them to replace the order instead of just handing me the missing ingredients.
The broth was consistent, but not really tasty. The ramen egg was a bit overcooked, so it didn't have the internal yolk consistency that shows that sense of wonder around the timing.
It just wasn't a great experience. I have found the ramen created from online recipes to be better. The chashu pork was good but not impressive.</Review></record>

The Spicy Miso Ramen is FIRE! Soo freakin’ delicious. I drank my hubby’s leftover soup. The Okonomi Fries were ok, a little greasy for my liking. Next time, I’ll try to the karage chicken :)

Staff is real cool, and the decor has a chill vibe - reminds me of L.A.  What a wonderful addition to Roseville!</Review>

<Review>Walking in the restaurant is spacious, feel comfortable and clean, good decorations. Ramen and chasiu rice (pork over rice) taste excellent, the broth is the best including Sacramento area!! Service is great and they have bowls and utensils for kids. Foods came out in ten to fifteen minutes even on busy Saturday lunch hours. Service is little slow, maybe they just opened for a week. Seem like the owner is from Japan 🇯🇵<//Review>< pics>

Excellent Ramen in Roseville!! Tried various broths which are unique in savory flavors along with very reasonable prices! Appreciate that they separate the soup from noodles when ordering to go!</Text>

<text>I absolutely love the Tonkotsu Ramen (Salt). I love the sweet pork belly and the seasoned soft boiled egg. I added corn. Make sure you try different broths to make sure you find the perfect one for you. I tried the classic ramen with the soy based sauce and found it to be a bit bland for my taste buds. Still amazing nonetheless. The service is outstanding. They go out of their way to make sure you are happy. Don’t forget to tip!!<//text><UserId.>116329098068554877598<//UserId.>< resp>

<review>I've eaten here probably close to 30 times since they opened, including pickups during covid. There's a few Ramen spots around Roseville at this point, but they are the best. For that classic Ramen, just get the fukumi ramen with spicy on the side. Also, for when they finally open indoor dining, they sell beer for like 3ish dollars, which is awesome.</review><Date>1611974276159< /Date>< Resp>

Had a craving for ramen and decided to try this place out. Had the Fukumi ramen and the honey garlic chicken, both were amazing. Chicken was moist and the sauce was delicious. Ramen was great, plenty of chashu and the broth is so, so good. Prices are very reasonable. The only downside is that I don't live anywhere near Roseville!<//Review>

<Review>Prayers have been answered! Quality made from scratch ramen in Placer! No more driving to Sacramento EVERY time you want good ramen. The Tori Miso was absolutely to die for, trust me, you don't need to have tonkotsu to enjoy ramen and this Tori Miso proves it. The chashu is out of this world tasty, such a strong flavor and melts in your mouth. Perfectly poached and marinated egg with a jammy yolk that can only be reached if you truly know your stuff. Thank you Fukumi!!! You are heaven sent!<//Review>< pictures>

I have had this place five times with takeout since my son really likes them.
My first onsite experience well it was Very Very bad experience.!!
Service - awful
Ramen was ok, but they charged  us for everything like a dab of hot chili paste which they dont mention when your asking for it.

They forgot to add bok choy in one of our soups and when we mentioned it the waiter brought out a few cold leaves to place in the soup.

Overall the experience was just not worth the time or money.

Side note;
Looked up this type of ramen and cooking process.  There was no 72 hr recipes and in fact this seems questionable since the recipes call for a 12 hr rolling boil not simmer for 72 hr.

Do not recommend this place at all.</Text>

I wasn’t there to see exactly what happened with your order but our spicy paste is clearly on our menu under extra toppings.\n\nAlso about our 72 hour Tonkotsu broth, you are very wrong about your comment. We do simmer our Berkshire Pork Bones for 72 hours and we do not lie about how we make our food.\n\n12hr is minimum you need to boil to make a decent ramen at home.\n\nI understand that you didn’t want to pay extra $1.00 for your spicy paste and I apologize if there was a mistake on your order but what you said about our broth is completely wrong.\n\nYou shouldn’t put false informations about a business when you have no idea how much time we spend just to have a completed bowl of ramen.\n\nYou’re welcome to go somewhere else to get yourself a bowl of ramen that’s watered down seasoned with pre-made soup base topped with pre-made frozen chashu 🙂\n\nAlso you don’t see 72 hour process via online or google because it is not common process for people who cook at home or any restaurant to put that much effort to get to the perfect state of the broth.\n\nThis link is for your reference to show you 72 hour process is not something that’s made up by us.\n\nhttps://www.lamag.com/digestblog/3rd-generation-sake-bar-is-a-downtown-noodle-sanctuary/'}<//Response>

If you like spicy, definitely go with the Kara-Miso. The broth is super flavorful, the Chashu pork is sweet and smokey, and the soft boiled egg was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Highly recommended!

We were not fans of the edamame as they were a bit overcooked, but we went there for the ramen and are so glad we did! I wish we got pictures.

For COVID cleaning procedures, I saw them cleaning all the menus, the credit card payment portfolios/clipboards, and the tables/seats. All the servers and employees were wearing masks.< /text>< pictures>

Fantastic Ramen in suburbia! Hooray! I hail from Seattle and was spoiled by great Asian food there. This is legit stuff. I had the Tantan Ramen and had good spice and very rich broth. Noodles were perfect and chewy. Not a pork belly guy so may ask for a different meat next time but it was still very flavorful.<//text>

First time here and food was hot and fresh. Broth for the ramen was very good as well as their appetizers. Service was great as well. Will definitely be back again.</review>

Food was good. They have Orion beer imported from Japan. Felt a little unorganized but it was only their second day open. Hoping to go back and try again.</Review>

Had a craving for ramen and decided to try this place out. Had the Fukumi ramen and the honey garlic chicken, both were amazing. Chicken was moist and the sauce was delicious. Ramen was great, plenty of chashu and the broth is so, so good. Prices are very reasonable. The only downside is that I don't live anywhere near Roseville!</text>

I never leave reviews but I stumbled across this ramen house by accident and my gosh it is the best restaurant  discovery I’ve ever had, in house it’s modeled beautiful, extremely clean and their ramen is by far the best ramen I have had in the sacramento area, their broth is beyond words you need to try it yourself, I tried their miso and spicy miso, the spicy in my opinion had the perfect kick where you could just feel the warmth In your face but not to where you shed tears. I would recommend anyone to come here. Fast amazing service. Thank you! I will be back soon!</review>

<review>By far the best ramen in the Sacramento region. I have been looking forward to this ramen shop opening up for sometime now. They absolutely did not disappoint! Their noodles were perfect and their broth was rich perfection. I ordered the Fukumi ramen and my friend ordered the Tantan, they were both spectacular! It’s nice to finally have a shop that takes ramen seriously, especially one that’s in my backyard (Roseville). I foresee this place rapidly becoming a local hot spot. I’m definitely looking forward to many trips back to try their entire menu, but for now I am STUFFED!<//review>< user_name>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>Finally! AN EXCELLENT RAMEN PLACE IN PLACER COUNTY!  I admit I am spoiled.  I had ramen in SoCal (LA and Irvine), Hawaii (Honolulu), San Jose, and San Francisco.  I heard about this place and I was waiting for them to open this month.  Karaage is delicious!  It's juicy and the flavor is so good that you crave another.  The ramen is delicious too! The broth leaves an impact, the noodles are neither too hard nor too soggy (AND ACTUALLY HAVE FLAVOR), and the CHAR-SHU IS SO GOOD!  This place will have a following, and I can already imagine lines outside the door for this place.  They do have a sign-in sheet, but I think they will need to invest in another bench for waiters outside.< /Text>< Name>

<review>The 5 stars is for the food. I had the miso ramen and it came fast and hot! The noodles still had the preferred aldente consistency and the broth was flavourful without being overwhelming. I ordered a side of gyoza and was surprised that they didn't have hot chili oil...since they recently opened, I'm not going to knock them for this. The space is perfect for this concept...it's all about the ramen. It reminds me of the ramen houses in Japan. I'm definitely coming back.<//review>< name>

food is okay and place looks dirty but it is close to my work so i visit this place every so often. this last time I placed an order for a burger. I asked no mustard or ketchup. The person on the phone went on to say that it didn't have ketchup. Since I've ordered before I know it has ketchup but I asked what it had. He said mustard, mayo, jalapenos, avocado, union, meat and lettuce. I go to pickup my order and IT HAD KETCHUP! I call back and say that i just picked up and order and it had ketchup, if they could please make a new one. He said well you didn't ask for it without ketchup. At this point I explain that I did ask without ketchup and because he said no, I asked what it came with and ketchup was not brought up by him. The guy cuts me off as I'm speaking starts yelling at me over the phone that its not his fault that i didn't order right and that he wont give me a refund if I take it back. he said in Spanish, "I don't have time for this you are wasting my time"  His attitude really killed that place for me. Wont be going back. he could have just said sorry for the miscommunication instead of saying, " I know what i f**n said"</Text>

Their food is okay but the guy there is always so rude to me. First time I came, I thought he was just having a rough day because it looked busy.  Came back today and he was just as rude. I mean if you’re going to work in service at least be nice...</review>

<review>Good place to have louche if you work around the area, The food is not the best you have tested but it has a family touch/feeling.
They close on Mondays.</review><Gmap_id>0x808e1b3d336a074d:0xa6bbd559d692d670<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Nice and clean place to eat if you have enough mullah,  their standard plate starts at $25 an the worst they have two taco sizes, the small one which is about half the size of a regular tortilla for $2.50 yes I'm not kidding,  so I personally won't come back even if I win the lotto.</Review><Name>Mauricio Cebada</Name><Gmap_id>0x808e1b3d336a074d:0xa6bbd559d692d670<//Gmap_id>< user>

Amazing staff, kind, and interactive with their patients. My son got his first filling here and it was a breeze. The nurses were really gentle and attentive to my sons needs. The doctor was very informative and answered all my questions and concerns. I can’t say enough. I’m really happy I have found a permanent pediatric dentist close to home.< /review>

<Review>What can I say about this place... I was referred here by my childhood Dentist because my daughter was terrified. She had previous bad experiences with Dentist in the past. I’m so happy I gave this dentist office a try. They were patient and compassionate about their job Jasmine was so gentle with my daughter it was amazing I expressed to her my concerns and how my daughter is terrified about having her seat all the way back she told my daughter she would lean her seat back until she’s no longer comfortable. She allowed my daughter to touch everything prior to her teeth cleaning which I think helped my daughter. She walked out smiling and we booked another appointment for her next 6 months I cannot express how happy I am I’ve found a dentist office who cares about their patients concerns especially children. I have a 6 year old who is terrified but she told jasmine I’ll see you next time.
They’re office is very clean and cute each room has a different theme and different movie playing it’s a kid zone who make children feel welcome they even have seats for the adult that accompany the child to sit and watch. That way you won’t look over the child and doctor shoulder you can see up close and personal.</Review><Time>1621289066906< /Time><Resp>{'time': 1621876920540, 'text': "Thank you for your review!

Amazing staff from the front desk to the dentist/ dental assistance. Clean and spacious location. I must add that my 3 year old is not open to new people especially with his personal space. He allowed every person to interact with him with such ease.<//Text>

I normally use all my daddy tricks to calm down my daughter but at the Crenshaw location I didn't use any of them.  The staff was extra friendly and kept my daughter attention plus made it a fun experience. I don't have any idea what's their secret but I noticed all the kids were just joyful like they were at the park.<//text>< Pics>

My kids love this place. Everyone is so genuinely kind. They talk the kids through the process so they feel informed. Sarah is literally the sweetest she helps them stay at ease and engages them in conversation while they wait. Shawntel is amazing! She even negotiates with the tooth fairy 🧚🏾‍♀️<//review>

I highly recommend this dental office for the children. I am currently taking my girls and I love the cleanliness, kindness from the whole staff. Starting with the girls in the front desk and in the back with the technicians. Of course, Dr. Assal was great with my girls. They always look forward to going to the dentist.

Thank you Dr. Assal for having a great team.

Dr. Assal was quick and helped explain the best options for my children. Kayla worked on my children’s teeth and she helped make the time pass in a fun and friendly way! I would point out other specific ladies but honestly every one of them front and back office went above and beyond! Thank you!!!<//text>< gmap_id>

This is my sons favorite place. Staff is amazing and Shawntel is great with kids! My son used to be scared of getting his teeth checked but they make sure they get him comfortable before doing any treatment. Now he’s always happy to see them in his appointments.

Other dentist will torture your children to bill insurance.  Dental fun zone does not do this.  They were very helpful and patient with my daughter who suffers with dental anxiety due to past dental work at other locations.  I highly recommend this place.< /Review>< name>

Liam’s appointment was at 8am in the morning and were there 10 min earlier. The wait was long (We didn’t see the dentist until 8:45) and having to fill out forms on my phone while watching Liam was not a fun experience. Problems with saving and filling the forms, finding out informations for insurances etc, these forms should be sent out the day prior to the appointment so that parents don’t have to deal this while waiting. This also delayed the time we were seen.</Review>

We moved to Westchester last year and my son was due to go to his old dentist in west LA just as the pandemic hit, so we ended up being 15 months out from his last appointment when we discovered CDFZ. We make a point of doing most of our business in diverse areas, and were so happy to find this excellent dental practice at the juncture of Crenshaw and Leimert Park. My 9 YO was accustomed to a friendly, kid-centered practice and this was a perfect fit for us to make a move to. Dr. Ashley and her assistant Kayla were delightful, knowledgeable, kind and very kid-focused. They made him (and me) feel at ease and he got the 'No Cavities' award which, if you're a parent, you know, goes a long way. Absolutely recommend this practice and staff - 5 stars all the way.</Text>

I was going to Chase on Monday and decided to drop in here. They checked my temperature and gave me hand sanitizer. They ladies were very friendly and it was huge! Set up an appointment and we came in Wednesday. The dentist was really great, they even let me stay with my daughter. There's a dentist for adults next door and I'll be going there next week for myself.< /Review>

Made an appointment with this office because it’s closer to home. My children were patients at their Pico office before. The staff at the Crenshaw office are AMAZING!! Everyone is very friendly but also professional. My boys have very bad dental anxiety, BUT they were so good here. The best place for children’s dentistry hands down!</Review>

She was scared to go, but we convinced her that everyone goes to the "tooth doctor." Like taking medicine. We ended up leaving half way through the appointment... I didn't think we'd ever get her back to the dentist again! We heard about the Funzone from our pediatrician. What a life saver! This place should be mandatory for every kid's first visit. They really know what they're doing. My kid actually asked when she gets to go back again. Don't go anywhere else.

<text>This dental office was very clean the staff was very warm and welcoming!! When you first come into the door the front desk clerks are amazing!!
Dr. Ramen was amazing he took time to explain every procedure in detail!!! My seven-year-old received two root canal’s!!  Which took maybe 25 minutes!! And she was excited and jolly during the whole procedure!! This is experience was much better than playground dental experience!!!  I give this general team five more stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /text>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) Dr. Ashley treated my granddaughter very well, I speak very well to her. The assistants in the back are very friendly although I could not communicate much because they do not speak Spanish but they try !! The girls in front are very friendly as well! I recommend the office.

La doctora  Dr Ashley trato muy bien  a mi nieta , le hablo muy bien . Las asistentes de atrás son muy amables aunque no me pude comunicar mucho porque no hablan español  pero intentan !! Las muchachas de enfrente son muy amable al igual ! Les recomiendo la oficina .</Review>

Always a great experience, great selection, whether vinyl or CD. Staff is great as well, helping find the album (or ordering from them). I always shop here before ordering music online.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Decent music store. I was impressed they had vinyl (why I came in). Some albums were pricy, but I understand you'll pay more in LA. I ended up buying the V for Vendetta soundtrack, well worth the cost.< /text>

One of Westchester's last Local Treasures.
This is a place thats been around forever and needs to stay around. Would you like that new album in CD or Vinyl? Want the classics they got you. Need a collectors item for a gift they got you.

Cd's,Cassettes, Dvd's, Vinyl, 45's, etc. They got it. Also tour and movie poster's, shirts, decals, one of a kind music items can be found here.
You can also sell/trade them cds,dvds, memorabilia, etc.

If you haven't been here, it's definitely a spot that folks should make their way to see if visiting LA.

Local Favorite. Small business. Community Staple. reaLA< /Text>

<text>Soundsations is always the best place to buy  LPs, CDs, and DVDs!  The service is great. If they don't have what you want, and if it's still available, they will order it.  I've been a customer since the mid 90s.  These guys are the best!<//text><user_name>Debra Dominguez< /user_name>< Pics>

I'm always up to get lost in this place for a few hours.  It makes me feel nostalgic.  It's hard to ignore the possibility that the traditional music store is near the end of its life cycle.  You walk around in here knowing that future generations may not be able to.<//Text>

Prices have gone up a bit it seems but they've still got a great collection of primarily rock, jazz, blues, etc... Great location, space, but they should have more disco, funk and soul in my opinion.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Nice medium sized shop with a decent selection and a wide variety of releases not commonly found at stores this size. They sell new and used vinyl of course but they also have a nice selection of CDs and cassettes as well as movies. Staff was super friendly which made a first time visit feel more welcoming. Street parking mid afternoon wasn't that tough and the prices were pretty good. All things being equal, Supersounds is in my top 5 record shops in SoCal. Definitely worth the stop.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>If you're into old school vinyl, tons of different genres of music, and used CDs then this is the place to get them at. I bought two CDs as I am more of a digital listener but there's always a good thing and feeling to actually physically owning the CD.< /Review>< rating>

A large variety of records. New, old, rare, rock, jazz, soul, hip hop, whatever you're looking for (as a broad statement) you should find. Prices range from a steal to standard. On top of that, the staff seems professional and nice. Buying the records was a painless, quick process. Will most likely be coming back soon.</Text>

<text>I’ve been visiting this business for at least 20 years and I’ve never had a bad experience. Three great guys run this place and through my teenage years until now they have always treated me the same. I often stop by when I’m in the area or drive out early in the morning to get a few records and I always leave with something whether it’s a new release or a rare record. To me this is a place that has earned my business for life. One thing I should do is learn the guys names because I’ve never asked. :/< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Best Small Record Shop in All of Los Angeles! I've ben going to this store for about 24 years, and it had the same customer service friendly, intimate, knowledgeable, concerned staff and feel it did from day one. If they don't have it, and it exists, they can get it for you. This has always and will always be my #1 Source of music hunting and time wasting. Love this place and love these guys!<//text>

A nice record shop with a decent selection and average prices. They could do with a little clean up and new shelving but its a great place to go if you can't make it out to Amoeba.</review>

<Review>Always go there for Vinyl or CD's. Case in point-amazon wanted $65 for Beastie Boys Licensed to Ill... got it at SoundSation for $3.99. If they don't have it, they will order it , and have it shipped to the store with NO EXTRA FEES.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b0d2af73c753:0xdc014fd874556488<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

“Long Live Rock n Roll”

In a digital era of downloadable tunes, it’s time to ask ourselves a deep question. Are we ready as a society to nail the coffin shut, burying our intangible memories when music had a soul, a voice, and a pictorial visualization?

Do you remember the feeling of giddiness and anticipation as we tore off that annoying cellophane—only to unveil our favorite artist’s newest release we played loud and proud as we browsed through the vivid, artistic, & artist-inspired interpretation of their compilation as depicted through the cover art design and flip through the mysterious insert within?

I only ponder this thought because I made a recent CD purchase. (My last CD purchase, if memory serves me right, was the exact moment Vanilla Ice’s single, “ICE ICE BABY” released.) [Feel free to stop reading for my honesty and embarrassment–which I why I will never put my name to this piece.]

As my taste buds for fine wine have with time acquired, so has my yearning for meaningful lyrics & varying artistic expressions of similar pains and torment I have experienced.

I bought Pearl Jam’s Greatest Hits, 1991-2003; again, no music-connoisseur by any means but my taste is slowly maturing. I held the cardboard dual CD case in awe only to unveil the poignant insert that for a brief time forced me to escape this reality I have created.

I sat paralyzed, flipping through the black & white pages depicting their early years as they built by hand the cover photo backdrop for their introductory album, “TEN”. Then, something happened. As I listened to the music I’ve heard over and over in my past, I now listened with virgin ears. What changed? I now heard the feeling. It was a foreign experience that a mere CD insert imploded upon my senses. I heard pain, life, struggle, hardship, regret, love, tragedy, innocence, and human error. I saw myself in the ugliest of states on up to my greatest sense of strength.

I am humbled by this experience…enough to recount the event. If you’re seeking a conclusion, my best articulation is that convenience has stolen my youth.
I will never be able to pass on this feeling or experience to my baby girl. She will most likely never hold a CD cover or glimpse at an antiquated insert so as long as her iPhone or ‘i-Whatever’ consumes her life in 2027.

But I’ll never forget.

Call it a plug, call it what you will. Keep local, low-budget radio stations & record stores funded; at least enough to light the dim road the strike a match to, unleashing the power that only music possesses.

In the end, I am however just a hopeless nostalgic and feel entitled to embellish. If you’re ever in LA, stop by Soundsations. I have visited the small record store merely twice, but they’ve been such a significant presence in my life for well over a decade.</Review>

<text>This place gives good trade for cds, DVDs, blurays, vinyl and video games! The new stuff they carry always tend to be cheaper than buying even from eBay. However sometimes the used stuff they carry, they try to sell at new prices or near new prices. But I've also found some cool promo albums(industry only stuffs) as well as older hard to find stuff. There big downfall to me is that they are a small store with not enough inventory to meet my needs. They don't actively try to restock things that sell and would rather order a record for you. This may sound like a bunch of negative stuff but when you buy a new record for $10 cheaper than eBay, you tend to let the little stuff go. I'd really suggest to check it out and see what they have that you might be looking for.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2b0d2af73c753:0xdc014fd874556488<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

These guys made it through the dark years in between the downfall of CDs and the revival of vinyl. They are down to earth,  honest, fair guys without an iota of snobby hipsterism. The same few guys have been working there as long as I can remember- and I'm 29 now and remember buying my first CD there when I was 11 or so. My favorite thing about soundsations? It's a hidden gem and its very rarely picked over and is usually stocked fairly priced used and new records.

Viva soundsations.</Text>

We started up with Stokley properties just this year. We have been very pleased with their services. We are doing a lot of upgrades to our properties and they have provided us with the right contractors to do the job.Their efficient office staff has guided us along the way.  Their contractors are easy to work with and  are always prompt with returning phone call. Very happy with the service they are providing.</text>

The team in Stokley properties are professional and were able to find my tenant  at the earliest. They took care of doing the background checks of potential renters and quickly organized their move in date.< /Text>

My overall experience in the rental was okay, but maintenance responses were slow, including a period when the heater went down and it took almost a week before getting a service person to visit the home.  Also, the closing experience was not very good.  I removed my reoccurring payment from the Stokley Properties online portal to avoid continuing to pay rent after I had moved.  The portal still took the payment and it took me over 45 days to get a refund - with weekly follow-up. Once I received the payment, my bank put a two-week hold on the check, citing funds not available.< /review>

Although my and I can't speak for everyone at Stockley Properties, we can say that Loren is one of the laziest property managers we've ever worked with.  My wife and I own 5 rental properties and all of our other managers do their best and really try hard to get a good outcome for everyone...Loren couldn't have cared less what happened to our property.

We received an offer Friday afternoon, approved the offer Friday afternoon, and Loren didn't respond to us or the prospective tenant until Monday morning...

Loren said "Just so we are on the same page and proper expectations are communicated, we work Monday-Friday from 8pm-5pm. I do my best to respond to all communications during that time frame within 24 hours or less."

Maybe this is normal for Stokley Properties and their team, but I don't work strict hours, I don't really know anyone who does, and I certainly don't expect my property manager to be unaccessible for 60 hours (what if there was a tenant emergency?!?!)<//review>

I have used Stokley Properties for the last 7 years.  They have always been there.  Together we needed to work through a very tough rebuild and re-lease on insurance and they stood up to the challenge with tough conversations and a rolodex of resources.  They also handled a sale and marketed it very well.  Most importantly, they pay detailed attention to their business and are involved in the community.  I was very happy and slept well being far away from my rental.</review>

I lived in a Stokley property for about 18 months. The property was very nice and the rent was priced fairly. Never had any issues with getting maintenance requests completed in a timely manner and the move out process was easy Would rent from them again.<//Review>

Stokley Properties is knowledgeable in the industry. When you need help in renting, leasing or selling property, they have a pulse on how market areas are performing, upcoming trends, and will help you price your property appropriately for quick turn around. The office staff are super supportive, highly responsive, and professional.   There’s no other Property Management company like Stokley Properties who does it all. You will find no other company that has the amount of passion that Stokley Properties has. They genuinely care about their clients.  Joe and Sheila are active in the Contra Costa county and consistently give back to the communities.<//review>

They do all the tenant communication and bookkeeping and they're a total turnkey offering. From what I can tell the tenants like them too which demonstrates fairness in all areas of their offering.

I'd recommend anyone considering them as your property manager give them very serious consideration.<//Review>< user>

I recently submitted a maintenance request over the weekend and was surprised to get a response within 2 hours. We even had a technician come out the very next day which was a Sunday to fix the issue. Hats off to Stokley for coming so quick to the rescue!

Excellent service from a stand-up company.  Joe and Jill are very attentive to both us as owners and to our tenants, and they have excellent resources for taking care of the maintenance, repair, and clean-up jobs that are common to every new rental startup.  Communication is also thorough and timely, and the monthly reports are clear and readily available.  We couldn't be more pleased!<//review>

As first time landlords deciding to rent our “home” of 35 years, we knew very little about the process. Everyone has been helpful, proactive, very fair—to both homeowners and tenants. They found us awesome tenants, got us through a couple of difficult surprise maintenance issues and facilitated our lease renewal. And I love that everyone works as a team.
Thank you Stokley Properties for everything!< /review>

<Text>I have been renting my home from Stokley Properties going on 2 years now and have no complaints. They have great customer service, for ex; when we need maintenance or have an issue, they are quick responding and on top of it. They will try and work with you if they can when certain issues arise and I appreciate there staff and will miss that they are no longer my property managers. I haven't worked with many, but I can say they are one of the best property management companies I've come across so far.  :)<//Text>< Pictures>

Joe and Sheila Stokley have a unique advantage over competing local property management companies.

Their sophisticated level of experience provides valuable insight and expert guidance for their clients. Property owners will experience a much higher level of service and counsel to ensure the highest returns with the least amount of tenant turn-over and costly down time for rental income.

The team at Stokley Properties are dedicated to providing the best possible experience for both their property owners and their tenants. I have referred all of my real estate investor clients to Stokley Properties.

I highly recommend the property management services of Stokley Properties - Pete Sabine. Pacific Union Real Estate.< /Review>< pics>

My move in was 4/2018. I have lived in my place for 1 year. Stokely Properties was very organized and professional and I was treated with kindness that I will not forget.
Stokely Properties has been responsive to my needs and has a easy to use website.
My monthly rent is reasonable.
I like the place that I live in and it was move in ready fully accessible for my disability.
I would tell anyone looking for a place to start with Stokely Properties.</Text>

<review>Very nice community and surrounding neighborhood. Condo also very nice in a quiet area. Floor plan is much larger than most for price than others we visited at other locations. We especially like the benefit of having a washer and dyer in the condo. The only minus in the facility is that our condo's carpet was not replaced when we moved in so the light color carpet appears to be a bit worn with light stains. Despite that one factor we are very pleased with and find this facility to be a great place to live!</review>< Pics>

< Review>
We have always had impeccably superb service from Stokley Properties. Every single person who works there has been eager to help whenever asked. Attitude is everything my mom always said and I think Joe Stokley has gotten a team together who shine with "Great Attitude" and all the skills they need to run a fabulous organization.</Review>

I had very positive with Jill Goolsby at Stokley Properties, and was happy with my apartment complex (Santa Barbara Manor). She was understanding when I needed to leave my lease early, which was very much appreciated.  Good people to work with!< /text>

Late to respond to repairs. Fence fell and it took 2 weeks to get repaired(this occured 3 times in our 4 year stay). A stone wall barrier in the backyard fell 1 year ago and never was repaired, to this day you can go there and see the wall on the floor. Actual fence shared with neighbor is falling into the neighbors yard.. we notified them multiple times. We have dogs so these conditions in the backyard are completely unacceptable. I will attach photos later.

They blamed us for any and all mishaps. The dishwasher went out and they sent a repair man twice and the issue persisted. The backyard wall was never repaired. Blinds in the rooms were replaced once, once another one broke in another room we were told it is "wear and tear" and we would need to come out of pocket.

Upon move out they were late to respond to emails. They blamed us for missed meetings. They stated their hours are 9a-4p and that we would have to work within their schedule for pre-move out. Had they not waited 30 hours to respond to their email then I could have figured a way to get time off. Last minute on everything with this process. Blake was just rude during our encounters via email regarding move out. Arrogant for no reason. No customer service at all. We were tenants for years..literally paid $100k + in rent over the years and treated like less than dirt upon move out.

In 2017 and 2018 they waited until after May 22nd to send us new lease paperwork that would take effect 6/1. Upon move out I actually reached out to them because their lack of communication. I notified them we would move prior to them asking us lease information. I was met with "you didnt give us 30 days. we will charge you for the remaining days."

I have a feeling my deposit is gone now. I am almost positive they're going to come up with some reason as to why they wont give it back. ***i will update as this process finishes***

I wouldn't recommend this property management company to A.N.Y.O.N.E</text>

Stokley got me the ideal tenant, managed my rental properly, and helped out tremendously when i had some flooding issues in early 2017 when we had so much rain.  Although I have not had much experience with other residential property managers, I cannot believe anyone could do a better job than Stokley in the east bay!<//Text>

My experience with Jennifer from Stokley
Properties is that she is honest and ethical. I never worry about being unnecessary "repairs" to the property or being cheated.  Best property management company I have worked with.</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Responsive friendly service...that doesn't ever actually fix anything. Want to have squirels keep you up for hours a night every week, how about asking for help for over two years and never having it addressed? How about knowing about the issue before they rent you the place and not saying anything? If this is your version of ethical business - you should rent a home from stokley properties. Great company for landlords that want to raise rent, HORRIBLE company for tenants that want to have a home that habitable.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I know the owners of Stokley Properties from our industry association and conferences.  They are first class people and wonderful property managers.  If I owned or was looking to rent property in their area, I would contact them first.< /Review>

I couldn't be happier with the services provided by STOKLEY PROPERTIES. Even before I had decided on listing my property, Joe went over the residence with me and pointed out all the little things I could do to get good tenants and a fair price. This saved me so much money upfront, and produced incredible tenants, who are now in their second year with us. The professionalism and efficiency of this company are truly refreshing in the current climate of rip-offs and questionable deal-makers. I whole-heartedly endorse STOKLEY PROPERTIES as THE premiere property management service in this area.< /review>

<review>Always there when I need them, the team over at Ace Hardware know how to talk to customers and provide assistance without pressure or unwelcome salesmanship. I can honestly say I've been in at least 100 times for random bits and tools for household jobs and repairs, and it is a rare occasion that I don't find what I need. If you want personalized advice or attention, ask for Charles!<//review>< pictures>

Ace Hardware on Eastlake Ave. Here is a place that gives you plenty of help as soon as you walk in the door, or... If you just want to look around, they simply say, "Okay, well if you have any questions on anything, just let any of us know..." On this day however I took my daughter in just to have a key made, she was having a hard time finding the right type of key that would match up, but the staff was so patient and even went and found and pulled all the options that would work so she wouldn't be disappointed. And there was ALOT of options the kid pulled out. Also, you KNOW the place is fun to work at as well because while we were there a female showed up to work, already smiling...and as we found out minutes later, it was her Birthday. She showed up on her birthday to work, on a Saturday! And the Crew didn't disappoint as they sang Happy Birthday to her. So again, Ace Hardware on East Lake Ave in Watsonville. One of 3 locations in our smallish town with a second being downtown on Main Street and the 3rd located on Freedom Blvd. Next door to Walgreens. Definitely 5 Star service at ALL 3 Stores!< /text>

Helpful people, though they aren't as knowledgeable as 'the old guy at the hardware store' (boy do I miss the old pre-Sears OSH!).  Like most retail these days, finding what you want is largely a matter of knowing what you want before you go in.
They get 4 stars because they're open weekends, have a reasonable selection of mostly residential items, they're not far from my house, and lack of knowledge notwithstanding they really do try to be helpful.<//review>

I am currently one of 50 + RSC Drivers that Deliver to Acehardwares in Northern California.  Acehardware Regional Supply Center (RSC) Is located in Rocklin Ca.  Can't say enough how Awesome the Owners and Employees of the Watsonville (2) Freedom I deliver every week. Reaching 100 years in Service is nothing to ignore. Ace is the place.
Thank you.       Scott MacGregor< /Text>

First time here and it was delicious! Everything was fresh and flavorful! Service was slow. I think they need more servers for service so that we are not flagging down one for refills on everything. But their soon tofu is delicious as is the pickled sides.<//Text>

<Response>None</Response><review>They have water base Soon Tofu. They have Veggie options. I love their veggie hot stone bimbimbob with no egg. They're dishes are served hot and you can choose your level of spice, it can be hot and spicy at the same time so be careful. I usually record my food cause it's always boiling and sizzling, but I'll take a picture next time I go. They have sake!

<text>First time here, service could have been better. I understand the staff are non-native speakers. However, their obvious bad attitude is apparent. I understand it’s close to closing time and we live in a very weird time amidst the pandemic. So we all are trying to live life under the new guidelines. I just wish they were more compassionate and friendly. Nonetheless, the food was good despite the prices being a little too expensive for its serving portions.<//text>< pictures>

Very disrespectful. The service is very lousy and upon payment, we provided our tip along with our total. The employees started to approach us in a rude manner demanding more tips and embarrassing my party in front of other customers. I used to eat here all the time. I will never return and I will tell my friends about how terrible this place is.< /Review>

<review>One of my favorite restaurants. The soon tofu is delicious, easy to eat and easy to digest. I usually finish my food and feel satisfied but not stuffed. The spice levels are accurately named, I think. Service is quick and professional. Usually not too crowded, but the whole shopping center gets packed on weekend evenings. They offer takeout, and even give you all the usual side dishes; it's not quite the same as eating there, but still very good. There's a small single bathroom in the back.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>112247367463005891947< /user>< rate>

Hey have 5 levels of spicy on their soon tofu. I usually get beef. They are also very generous on the side dishes, like the small bowl of Kim chi, Nori, and other Korean dishes.<//Text>< user>

<time>1517099388350</time><rating>2< /rating><text>I would have given this place 3 1/2 stars because of the food,however, the service left me feeling sour.The soup is great and so are the sides. It is fairly priced but the portions for the meat dishes are very expensive.If you are looking for a place to eat Korean soup, then it is fine...but here are the reasons i gave this place 2 stars. For reference, I have come to eat here 3 times.
The service is not very good.I am multilingual and I have traveled to many places including Asia.The service here is not friendly to non-korean speakers and they often are not attentive. When I finished paying the woman returned to my table and wanted me to pay more tip.I ate alone and my price in total was around 11 ish dollars nearing 12.I was rubbed the wrong way for her believing that tip is mandatory, and that her service deserved more than what I had already given her.I also work a service job and I believe that it isn't  a good way to behave with a customer.
It hasn't been the first time I have went to a Korean establishment and have been frequently harrased to leave more tip. I believe in tipping well when it is deserved, not because of social obligation. I am still on the lookout for good Korean restaurants with friendly service and am willing to give lee soon tofu the benefit of the doubt and hope it isn't usually like this< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b5828bcd4e65:0x1d8cb026dee1fc9c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) I ordered seafood sundubu and beef sundubu. As the rice comes out with stone-grilled rice, I was happy to enjoy the happiness.
It was delicious Sundubu.
Kimchi was also delicious and replaced.
The clerk was also friendly.

Great pho Thai tea is good but the glass it's served in is smaller in comparison to other restaurants I've frequented but not really a bad thing just make sure you don't down it too quickly because it is definitely one of the better tasting Thai teas I've had.</review>

My wife and I walk here almost weekly to get the Pho. The food here is overall good for the price and the service is very fast. We haven't had anything really that we didn't like so far and it's never that busy. Just as a pro tip you can order the pho to go and pick it up curbside if you want a nice soup if your spouse has a cold. Will definitely be coming here again!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Dr. Sidhu and his staff have been taking care of my elderly, ailing dog for several years. I can appreciate their follow up and willingness to answer any questions I have thoroughly. Whenever I have questions, the medical staff lets me know they will ask the Dr and get back to me instead of assuming the answer, which I truly appreciate. I like that Dr gives me several options on how to proceed and is never pushy. I know my dog's life has been extended several times due to the high level of care he receives at Archibald Ranch Animal Hospital.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

We brought both of our dogs in to see Dr Sidhu for full physical exams for they both had issues that made us seek a veterinarian.
1 of our dogs is an 8 yr old male and the other is a 16 yr old female
Dr. Sidhu made it perfectly clear that there were different options for the type of treatments as well as different price ranges.
We could choose from a minimal exam to extensive exam which includes a lot of testing, like extensive blood panels and X-rays, especially for our older dog.
Dr. Sidhu was very thorough as well as very personable, he spoke to us directly about any and all concerns he had, he gave us options when it came to different types of treatment, with this being said we chose the more expensive option due to the age of our dogs and to give us peace of mind as far as knowing that our fur babies were healthy
The one quality that stood out the most for us, was the fact that he spoke to us, it was not via a vet tech like other animal hospitals and our male had to have a minor surgery and he was very attentive and he even called us the following day to check on our dog! That is a real good thing, for he genuinely cares for his patients.
Thanks Dr. Sidhu we truly appreciate you and Cuddles and Bentley do too

Gave him some aspirin that did not help
His inflammation this almost killed my
Beloved family pet I normally do not do
This type of negative review but in this
Case I had to they are a sham they will
Over charge take your money and your
Pet may not make it there sick I really
Am upset that they are pet as strictly
Profit no genuine concern for our
Loved Rocky he is in pain Now and
Both my wife and I are a little sad due to
Poor evaluation of our pet to whoever reads
This review please RE consider bringing your

{'time': 1619050021333, 'text': 'Robert, you may remember we suggested a medication that we recommended, which can affect the liver and kidneys and we highly recommend a blood test to check the current levels before giving your dog the medication.  Due to your concern of costs we offered the option of signing a waiver to forego the blood work against our advice then we could prescribe the medication for your dog since you understand the risk.  You also didn’t want to do this due to costs.  You asked if there was any other medication to try.  We explained what we could offer and it’s possible it could help, but if it didn’t work we advise you come back for the better treatment.'}< /Resp>

We were traveling and our dog had a seizure because her blood sugar dropped and we didn't know that.  We called VCA in Fontana CA and were told sorry we can't help you, when I told them my dog will die the lady at VCA said "yes she probably will" well we found A R Hospital in Ontario CA and they took her right away and saved her life! Everyone at A R Animal Hospital is amazing! We can't thank them enough.  Highly recommend them.  Thank you A R Animal hospital for taking care of our fur baby.</Review>

I wasn’t really happy with this place. Nothing was wrong with the doctor or the vet techs. I got x-rays done for my dog here that were not clear because she was not eating or drinking water. They gave us a CD so that we could take the x-rays elsewhere, so I took them to my other vet and they said the x-rays were not good quality. I ended up having to do x-rays again at my vet because of the poor quality of the x-rays we had done here. Other than that, the everyone was courteous and polite. Not particularly warm or friendly like at other places. The prices were fair. I just wouldn’t go here again.<//review>

We have never had any quality issues with our X-rays with anyone.  We routinely send these to Radiologists.  We double checked your X-rays today to confirm the good quality.   It could be a defect when we burned the CD – just as we all have experienced a glitch in a file; or perhaps there were issues with your new vet’s software.

<Text>Thank you so much for the team and doctor here that saved our 12 week parvo puppy Leia 🙏🏼 We got lucky and got her in on time but it was a lot of upfront cost we can’t afford so we brought her home after 2 days there and the staff showed us how to do everything and called everyday to check on her and always answered our questions and calls.

My dogs and I have been coming here for years and I always receive the best care. The front girls are very kind and patient with all the questions I always have. I love how they take the time to help me to the car when I need help carrying those large bags of food. Now as far the prices go, I feel the prices are fair for the services you receive, and because the practice is so small they always seem to know who your pet is and speak to them by name which is the best feeling to know that they care about your baby as much as you do.<//text>

Our family just moved to Ontario, and we have been looking for a new veterinarian for our families fur babies for a little bit.  We came across
A R Animal Hospital with great happiness.  We chose this location above any other for several reasons.  Dr. Sidhu is great!. He is attentive to his patients, and treats them as if they were his fur babies.  His staff is great. Just like the Dr. they are always willing to help and answer all your questions, so that you may feel at ease.  In addition, the Dr. is very hands on in the office.  At times will come out to attend to his guests (patients/parents) in the waiting area.  Their communication is great also.  There is never a time that you dont know whats happening.  I know and feel that when my Brownie and Yum Yum is with them, both are in good hands.  We are so happy to have found A&R Animal Hospital.  Thank you for all that you do.< /Text>

<Text>It was my first time there, I took my dog in for a check up, and when I got called from the doctor to hear what her status was, he said she didnt have any fleas, but he said that the stuff I put in the concerns box are symptoms of allergies. When I asked how he knew they were allergies, he started talking about all the symptoms and all that stuff, but then he said something about how she was biting at  her paws, and I listened closely and told him she wasn't biting at her paws she was biting at the top of her paws and her front legs, but then he said "legs paws same thing." He also made sound like he didnt even check for fleas just went off of other dogs cases and the concerns I put in the concerns box. And that didnt sound right so we wont be returning here. Also, they are very pricey, you can finish by paying $300.00, just like that!! They also told me that she needs 2 other shots another day and that's going to be$50.50!!! And that's only for 2 shots!!< /Text>< pictures>

Walked by on the way to Ralphes to do some grocery shopping. A R Animal Hospital is a hospital for animals in case readers are confused by the name. The business  had a great closed sign. A very beautiful but dead flower in the bushes. I recommend to anyone interested in walking by a closed business, with a great closed sign, and a beautiful but dead flower in the bushes. 1 and half thumbs up. I would give it 2 thumbs up but I cut half my thumb off trying to split frozen burger patties with a sharp knife, go figure.< /text>

Our pet owners who know their dog is prone to biting are responsible and muzzle their dogs before treatment.  That is the best scenario for everyone.'}< /response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< review>
I didnt like how the dr handled my dog .
He basically choked my dog because he tired to bit but they should be trained on how to handle dogs that are wild. I am never bringing my puppy here again. Just the worse and to top it off when the dr  choked my dog my daughter was present and started crying saying why is he hurting our doggy. Saddest and unsafe I even experienced.< /review>

<Text>Took our four year old Chihuahua on Saturday, doctor didn't suggest immediate hospitalization. After I spent over $1000, they didn't call us with results. No sense of urgency even after they saw our dog was having trouble breathing. WE had to call several times asking for the results after being told we'd have them by Monday. Didn't get anything till THURSDAY EVENING because the main doctor left for Canada and didn't leave any kind of notice for the doctor to covering his shift. Our dog died Sunday morning. Definitely take your pets here if you love waiting for results, want to drop a grand, enjoy talking to people who don't care about pets or their job, and ultimately want your dog dead.<//Text>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1557959565642, 'text': 'Thursday you called our hospital stating your dog had been having trouble breathing for few days and made an appointment for that morning, but you didn’t come in.  Saturday you came in and we ran a test and gave you the option of expediting the results in 2-3 hours or the normal period of 2-3 business days and explained the difference in price.  You chose to wait.  We offered some diagnostic testing which you declined saying your dog would be okay.  Wednesday we called and left voicemail but you never returned the call.  Thursday you brought your dog in and our relief vet told you the dog needed oxygen therapy and medication and advised you the treatment would mean you would need to use a 24 hour clinic to continue the treatment due to the critical nature.  Our relief vet did give your dog oxygen treatment at no charge and only charged for the medication.  You called asking to return the medication after your dog died, but by law pharmaceuticals cannot be returned after dispensed.  We can only offer options for treatments and testing and explain the benefits and risks.  Your total bill was less than $465.00 (not $1,000.00).  We understand you couldn’t afford lengthy treatment.

Excellent, considering the circumstances; my daughter was still a teen when her cat, Millie, had a lump that was diagnosed as Cancer. Millie had surgery but unfortunately she developed a second site. The Doctor was so kind and compassionate, including my daughter fully in every conversation and decision. Her first experience with loss was so much less traumatic because of him. I will never forget his empathy.<//Text>

Dr. takes his time never rushes and he explains everything thoroughly and he is very aware of our limited budget.

Our boy passed away and Dr. personally called me to offer condolences. I have never had a vet do that. The staff is amazing, they truly love animals.

<rating>5</rating><Review>My puppy recently became very sick, so I took him to AR animal hospital, because when my cats incision came open, he saved her and I had a very pleasant experience, considering the circumstances. The Dr explained everything to me, in detail and stayed after hours to fix her. Turns out my pup had parvo and had to be hospitalized, a couple days later, his sister came down with it too. They listened and I feel they truly care. My girl has to have her blanket and shirt and they let her keep it with her. I was able to call to check on them and visit them as much as I wanted and I did... A lot! Lol they never made me feel like I was bugging them and answered all my questions. It's been almost a week since I brought my baby girl home and they both are doing amazing, right back to normal. They called today to check on them, which I thought was very nice. The Dr was realistic and honest about all possible outcomes, as well. Everyone I encountered who worked there were great. I will definitely be taking my fur Babies back to them on the future.< /Review>< pictures>

DO NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT TAKE YOUR ANIMAL HERE.  THIS VET IS A BUTCHER AND WILL KILL YOUR ANIMAL.  HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR BELOVED ANIMAL.  HE ONLY CARES ABOUT HOW GREEN IS YOUR MONEY.  HE BUTCHERED MY CAT AND THEN LEFT HIM ALONE ALL NIGHT LONG WHILE MY CAT DIED IN PAIN AND ALONE.  WHILE ALL THIS WAS HAPPENING HE WAS STILL TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY.  HE NEEDS TO HAVE HIS LICENSE REVOKED.  IF YOU LOVE YOUR ANIMAL PLEASE DO NOT GO IN HERE.<//Text>

DO NOT COME HERE. The vet is an angry man who will rob you blind if you bring your pet to him. He takes advantage of your emotions and makes up his own prices that make no sense. He is unprofessional and yells at distressed pet owners if they have an issue with his “pricing”. After being yelled at and forced to pay a huge bill I still don’t know what’s wrong with my fur baby. Long story short after all this I’ll being going to another veterinarian. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE. Seriously.< /Review>

I was hoping to find a good vet that cared for my pets and my small wallet but instead I found a vet that recommended a credit card for all the charges for tests and meds he wanted for my old dog with a heart murmur. I left there feeling like he cared more for my wallet.</Review>

<Text>I live on the east and was visiting my family in California for vacation. And of course I brought the two loves of my life with me, my two dogs. While I was here, I had noticed that one of my dogs wasn't eating as much for about two days and was just looking lethargic. So one of my aunt's recommended me to take my dog in for a check up and she recommended her own vet, Dr. Sidhu. Right as I walked in, I knew I was in good hands from the friendly front desk girl and the even more wonderful Dr. Sidhu. He explained everything that needed to be done, all the labs and tests and how much they would cost. After all the necessary steps taken, I am so happy to say that my dog was back to her happy self within a few days. I just want to say thank you to Dr. Sidhu for treating my dog and me like family and helping to answer all my questions along the way!<//Text>< Pictures>

If you love your pet don't take them here!!!Dr only cares about making money and not your pet. Took our cat here yesterday for throwing up and was told our cat needed about $900 worth of treatment and needed to stay overnight???  No thank you!  Took our cat today to our regular vet Victoria Animal Hospital in Rancho Cucamonga Paid $300 for 2 injections of antibiotics/pain meds, other take home meds & blood work and several  cans of mild digestive cat food and brought our cat home within a hour feeling much better.  Don't get played by this doctor!!!  Also he likes to respond back to all his BAD reviews with answers that try to explain away and cover up the truth!!! Look for yourself!!!! I can't wait to see what B....S...  he will  post regarding my BAD experience & review!!!  What a joke!!!!  Good luck doc!!🐈🐈< /text>

<Text>How is this place still in business?!?!!? I once took a poor little cat here and they told me they could't help. My sister also took her dog here and charged her over $400 for some very poorly done stitches. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PET HERE, they'll kill it.</Text>< Rate>

<review>The doctor speaks horrible English and preys on the emotional distress of pet owners. He scribbled a non legible number he totally made up the prices on a paper said sign this .He was very rude and quick to anger when I told him I want to get a second opinion actually yelling at me in the exam room. Please don’t ever come here . While in the waiting room I heard him pushing unnecessary meds on poor owners. He uses fear to get them to agree.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Clean, modern, on point, trendy Safeway with everything you could ever want and more.  Whether it's fresh seafood, hot freshly baked breads, crisp fresh fruit and vegetables, amazing floral department and so much more, this store had it.  This is a flagship store and it shows in spades, they get it and they work hard to create an experience better than most of not so grocery stores.  This is the new standard and high bar offering convenience and quality you can't find elsewhere.<//review><pictures>[{'url':

< Review>
Can't even give 1 star,and I shop this store all the time.I bought chicken tenders at in store counter granted it was $5.00 fri.this past wk.Iwas having a couple of people so I bought several lbs. When I went to serve ( 20 min.later) they were hard so much batting and so dry the people couldn't eat them.I had to put together a meat with the salads and sides I was serving.I will never buy them again there.Not to mention I had to tell them from Safeway on Hamilton in Campbell.I am hoping some one callsl me back or at least e-mails me.   In order to post this I had to give 1 star .</Review>

Safeway shops well.  The employees are good about wearing masks and keeping distance. They are also accurate in their shopping. I prefer the curbside pick up over delivery by the other guys.  Thank you!</Review>

We have been here 3 times to get curbside pickup and each time we had to return because we were missing from 3 to 10 items that we had ordered and paid for.  Also, we requested "No Substitution" on many items but were substituted anyway.  $6.49 for Asian Celery when we ordered regular celery!  Come on man!!!  Management needs to pay more attention and do better training.  We can't be the only ones experiencing this problem< /text>

A lot of good deals, great gift card selection, greeting cards and floral designs.
Starbucks is conveniently located in the store where Kali is so nice and quick to serve coffee.
The bakery has a variety of cake slices, breads, brownies, etc that are so yummy.  The fresh strawberry filled white sheet cake is delicious too.
A one stop grocery place.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Pretty big ,clean, some workers will stop what they are doing to actually help you find what you were looking for. I've even forgotten my credit card and phone and one of their workers found it and turned it in. Which was pretty awesome.</review>

If I could I would have given this safeway a -10 rating & zero stars.. went by to pick up a few things. Made it outside to my car. Had pulled up on the corner right next to the tables & chairs. Loaded my car & left the cart right on the corner (right on the other side of where they put collected carts)..then a short, dark haired employee aggressively grab the cart & with a very rude & Condescending Attitude said "couldn't have put the cart closer huh" while shaking their head. I was completely shocked. 1st of all I'm pretty sure its your job as a cart collector to grab the carts and if you're so miserable at doing your job then you shouldn't be in a customer service position. Then on top of that, they had the nerve to wave & say again with a very Snotty & rude Attitude "have a nice day" as I drove away. Will not be returning to this safeway</Text>

The vibe there is funky...its pretty busy there, and the checkers are not really trying to get you out of there quickly. It is limited in what it carries, and it isn't stocked well. I wasn't really able to get what I wanted cuz they only had part of the things I needed. Its just not like the Stevens Creek and Lawrence Expressway  store...that store is awesome.

I lived next to this Safeway for 4 years and it always had the essentials I needed even during the crazy holiday madness. Not sure what's changed since I left 3 years ago but the staff here was always friendly and parking is usually pretty easy to find even during rush hour or over the weekend.< /Review>

I like this Safeway better because they have shopping baskets for me to use when I only need to buy a couple of things.
What is that you said? All grocery stores have shopping baskets? I have to disagree. The other Safeway store I used to go to consistently always never ever had shopping baskets. Ghetto. :/< /text>

People don't follow the 6 foot rule . Isles are marked with direction one way markers no one is following any rules . People with no masks .. .employees are nice doing there best to disinfect and keep the store clean and stocked . While customers disrespectfully shop in the store and put family's and children Ali g with the employees at risk . Covid 19 is turning our great United States into a 3rd world country . It's sad . Good job Safeway employees your doing great .< /Review>

<Review>Masks on!! Employee is at the door to make sure you have one on, hands you sanitizer wipes to wipe your shopping cart and hands. Not too crowded at 1:00pm. My Cashier Shawne was very personal and spirited and very caring. She told me to take care, small conversation but it meant alot to me.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Location is well-stilocked and clean. However, they are usually understaffed after 8:00 AM, so I would recommend using the self checkout line most times.
Covid-19: store has a good setup on place, offers curbside pick-up, and requires a mask for all customers. Senior Citizen hoirs every Tuesday and Thursday mornings.< /Review>

It’s a ginormous grocery store that has almost everything you need.  Good sales, but a bit expensive if the item is not on sale.  And well stocked!  But good goddess it takes  foreeeeeever to check out.  Like, add 20 minutes to your trip because there is never enough check out people.  Ever.  We stop here a couple times a week at different hours and days, so there is plenty of time variation on our experiences. Well stocked stores don’t mean ish, if people can’t shop without taking a loan out from Father Time.  Don’t be so stingy Safeway, and put an extra cashier on the floor.<//Text>

24 hours! Daytime shopping is excellent. Usually well stocked. Friendly service. Good parking! Has multiple fun "car" double carts for people with kids. Docked a star for evening shopping. 24 hour location, but starts restock at 9pm. Couldn't get around the store well, multiple aisles blocked to the point I couldn't fit my body through, let alone a cart.</Review>

This Safeway is one of the nicest around.
Big and clean with a great selection.
This location has a bakery, deli, pharmacy, and floral department. There is an on site butcher and an in-store Starbucks and lounge area as well.
The produce, bakery and deli are always fresh. Customer service is Excellent.
Parking is abundant and there is also a large Safeway fueling gas station on the opposite end of the parking lot.</Review>

Went to regular checkout at night and was told that I have to use self-service unless I buy alcohol. Lots of fun with several items of produce, machine complaining that I need assistance, usual. So I guess I need to start drinking to not have to be my own checker.<//Text>

<text>They closed the door before 6:50pm on Christmas eve when they said close at 7pm.
There were like 5 groups of people just needed to grab one or two things only which won't take more than 5 minutes! We complained but they refused to open the door. They just want to go home early. SUCK!< /text></record>

They have a good selection of items here. Prices are not too bad. However they stopped carrying cake flour here so now I have to make multiple stops for my baking needs. The employees are always friendly and helpful.<//review>

Nice newer store. Well organized. Prices are not that great unless it is on special. But the worst part is it is excruciatingly difficult to check out. Every time I go there long lines clogging the checkout. Last time I went all self-checkout computers went down while I was in line. Employees just kept putting paper bags over the monitors.</Text>

Good Safeway.  Not as good as the other Safeway in town ( Hamilton Ave. ) and they are usually out of a lot of things.  I rarely shop here but when I do I go for the usual items which they usually have, but if you want  specific items definitely shop at the one on Hamilton Ave.</review>

Customer service getting worse. No baggers. Checkers have to bag the groceries. Card swipe/chip reader times out due to checker having to bag groceries. If you like incompetence, then this is the store for you.< /text>

It has a fantastic selection of quality produce, an onsite butcher, nice selection of fish, and a wide array of general groceries and home sundries.  They also have a competitively priced gas station.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.</Review>< pics>

Avoid the seafood/meat department if you can. I asked if they could cut the fish into smaller pieces and they said the counter had bleach on it, so they couldn't cut it. Not to mention that the guy who packed my meat didn't have gloves on. Seriously? Rest of the place is fine, cashier was polite, but the seafood/meat department experience was abysmal. Not</Review>

Your store Hamilton is a disaster.  No ad items on the shelves.   Ask a clerk if you can find one and they give you a rude answer.   This store has a lot of problems.  The problems  today are not the first time I have encountered problems in this store.   You better look at your help including the manager.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Made an online order with delivery in two days. At the time they supposed to deliver they called and told me that they cannot deliver due to a high demand (didn't they know the demand at the time I ordered?). They suggested me to reorder with next day morning delivery. After hanging up I tried to make another order, but all the slots were taken for several days.<//Review>< Pictures>

One of the rare Safeway locations with a Gas Station, new store format with a very large deli including a Starbucks and a sushi counter.  No bank inside, but there is a Citibank branch in the Plaza. Lots of parking.  The customer service is good and friendly.  But you may want to check expiration dates,  I found several packages in the lunch meats that were expired.< /review>

<Review>This paricular Safeway (Hamilton Ave) has gone seriously downhill over the last year. Stocking in all key areas  (produce, meats, dairy & eggs) has become horrible. Literally every week they come up short on 30 to 50% of items that are being advertised. In a recent visit looking for an advertised special on cage free eggs I came across a completely vacant egg display with about 1/2 dozen customers all wondering what the heck was going on. I got a senior store rep ( looked like the overall store manager ) and asked for help. He flat out said "sorry, I don't have anyone to help you right now". Not one to be shy about pressing, I did. He denied providing any help again, leaving an aisle full of customers with looks of confusion. I hate writing reviews but it's time this place started getting help to run right. Note: I have talked to MANY line level employees in all the areas I mentioned above and every one tells me they order what they need but that management and the warehouse routinely screw them. That leaves them making promises to customers that they have zero ability to ensure are kept.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>This place doesn't really carry what I want anymore and when I asked him to order it they told me they would but then it turned out that they decided not to and didn't bother to tell me. The night manager here is rather surly and unhelpful in fact I think she should be fired immediately or at least sent back for retraining.

The store has not improved at all. In fact it's actually managed to get worse. You go to the deli counter to get help and the employees just sit there and stare at you and ignore you. They never have what you want. this store is horrible and I do not understand anybody that gives it a good review these people must be lying< /Text>< Pics>

This store sucks!  Won't shave deli meat and never have enough baggers.  They should give a discount for bagging your own groceries.   I will not go there again! They just lost about 400 per week from me< /text>

Cashier lines are always waaaay too long and a lot more could be done to improve them and open up extra lanes to get lots of customers out more quickly.  The gas station machines need a lot of work as well and are slow if they happen to work so you can take advantage of your Safeway gas points.  Lines are confusing when they get too long as you need to circle around the back parking lot by the Consignment store to line up and you may be forced to parallel park or use a pump with the hose on the opposite side of where you gas tank is located even though you can stretch the hoses but a bit tougher for an SUV.  They also never seem to have the items listed on sale on the app even when this is marked as your home store.<//Text>

<Text>I was very pleased with Safeway employees who helped find certain items. Especially, at the meat dept the employees very pleasant and helpful. They were courteous and friendly I appreciate they assisted me accordingly.
I as a customer am very concerned about what Wal-Mart's mass lay off which I think greed beyond comprehension so I am boycotting Wal-Mart! So it is very helpful when Safeway employees are friendly and courteous.<//Text>< pictures>

My go-to local Safeway.
It's nicer and has a better selection than the one on Winchester, and the staff is usually pretty friendly.
I prefer to shop here after 9pm because I hate crowds 😊< /review>

Clean, large, easy parking, AC for the hot weather, and most importantly, well staffed so pretty quick checkouts. What else do you need from a grocery store?<//text>

Nice, newer large Safeway with a gas station.  However, the selection of organic fruits and vegetables is less than 25 percent of what is available at the Cottle Road location. They also do not have a section for organic dried fruits. Some other departments are also a bit thin for the size of the store. If you are in the area the Cottle Road location is where you want to shop.<//text>

Pretty decent but going downhill I think. As they try to do more, they don’t carry as much as they used to. And don’t go on a Sunday. Nothing is in stock. Pitiful.</text>

Checking out is also a huge hassle here. There are usually a few self-service machines that are not working. As a result, there is always a line for them, as well as the line for checkout with a cashier.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>There are several Safeways and even more grocery stores to choose from in the Campbell area but I usually find myself at this location if I need groceries. As a newer development I think its generally cleaner and more organized them some of the other locations. Prices are comparable to any other big chain grocery store and there is a lot of floor space allowing for a a good selection of most common items. There is a lot of parking and even a gas station in the same lot so its a rather convenient stop.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Worst delivery service I've ever experienced. My online order was NOT delivered in the designated 4 HOUR timeframe, and the 1877 customer support kept asking me to call 3 DIFFERENT Safeways in my area, none of which could help with delivery issues. LOST MONEY, and will report this to the Better Business Bureau.<//Review>

<Text>The Safeway at Budd and Winchester is pathetic. No carts available at the entrance, produce looks like leftovers, sale items on shelves are always gone, deli is pathetic with no one there to ever help you, bakery never has anything but French bread. Butcher shop is top notch, the only part of the whole store that seems to know what they're doing. Then you go to check out. 15 people in both lines! BOTH lines! They never have more than 2 lines open. Disgusting waste of time to go there.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Two! Two checkout counters open during Thursday evening rush hours. Waited for 30 minutes to get my ice cream to the counter. What a disappointment!

Edit: management made an effort to make things right by offering $5 off the entire bill.<//review>< user_name>

Hamilton Ave Campbell used to be a very nice store but changed 1-2 years ago. Now Each time I ask myself Why should I keep coming when it is so frustrating to shop. I've been a customer of Safeway for about 40 years spending $150 - $200 per week. So disappointed and frustrated.< /text>

This is my local Safeway and I'd much rather travel to a different location to shop. The lines are ridiculously long, I mean the quality of professional staff is little to none. Not to mention, the staff members complaining of being "short staffed" to their customers. This of course is a personnal issue and should be fixed with management but sadly is not. They do "stocking" during odd hours which of course lead to packed isles. The butcher is ruud! The produce selection is scattered.
SIMPLY AVOID THIS SAFEWAY. That is all.</review><user_name>Nisa R< /user_name><Date>1514926596271<//Date>< user>

<review>Safeway's (ALL) in general need more staff! It's ridiculously crowded at check out stands.
This is my local Safeway and I'd much rather travel to a different location to shop. The lines are ridiculously long, I mean the quality of professional staff is little to none. Not to mention, the staff members complaining of being "short staffed" to their customers. This of course is a personnal issue and should be fixed with management but sadly is not. They do "stocking" during odd hours which of course lead to packed isles. The butcher is ruud! The produce selection is scattered.
SIMPLY AVOID THIS SAFEWAY. That is all.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>102278042901887911558<//user_id>< time>

Two! Two checkout counters open during Thursday evening rush hours. Waited for 30 minutes to get my ice cream to the counter. What a disappointment!

Edit: management made an effort to make things right by offering $5 off the entire bill.<//text>

Terrible customer service at the deli. One employee behind the counter declined to help me, saying it was "not her job" to serve mac and cheese even though she was standing right next to it and no other employee was available. Meanwhile, I waited literally 20 minutes while another particularly inept employee struggled to make two sandwiches for the only other customer at the deli. I just moved to California from out-of-state last week and had never been in a Safeway before. I have no intention of visiting this location again.< /text>

Long lines. Cramped parking lot. Too much stuff in the aisles, creating traffic jams. Very erratic about availability of items. They put displays at the end of the checkout lanes so you can't pull your cart up to unload. It all makes for a miserable customer experience. Go elsewhere.< /Review>

Worst customer service by Angela. She  was rude and unprofessional.  She needs to get rid of her gum while she is taking to customer. And change her attitude. She should never work at guest service.<//review>

Very expensive comparing to Sprout. There is a small market called Oakmont pretty close to Safeway. They are way cheaper than safeway in terms of fruit and vegetables. Safeway has more options of course. Youncan still find cheap stuff in safeway too. It all depends what you are going to buy basically.< /Text>

No christmas stamps and the guy was going to charge me for stamps even before he was sure if he had christmas stamps,then explained how that wasnt a good idea because if he didnt have christmas stamps he'd have to do a return, im not sure why he cant check the drawer beforehand to find out if the product is even available, but he was annoyed when i reiterated i only wanted christmas stamps once i realized he was charging me for them before knowing if he had any, this guy must have been tired! But still poor customer service sucks. then the lady at customer service helped me with my question about christmas stamps 'before' the gentleman that was already waiting in line in front of me, aaarrrggg, it was like a zoo last night<//Text>

I really only go here because it is close to my home. The aisles are constantly cluttered with DUMB displays that prevent accessing items or just having 2 way traffic. If not that then workers are stocking up or doing inventory. (This is between 9am and noon on weekends.) Prices are high too.

While some of the cashiers are great (fast and friendly) others just don't give a darn and are more concerned with their "shift ending in 10 minutes" or just look around instead bagging/checking. I even scolded one after her "put one item in a bag then look around" routine hit 5 times.

I didn't have this low opinion when the store was on winchester and payne.</Review>

Their price is high, but it’s a store that does worth to go, you can find most of the things that you want over there in a good quality, but again a little bit more expensive than other places< /review>

Ailes are narrow and packed with boxes makes it difficult to pass each other or it basically one lane

The fruits and vegitables are poorly arranged and inefficient

They dont refill the shelves...now I have to go to other places to buy things</Review>

There is only ever two check stands open during rush hours and both lines end up pat the produce and into the isles. Safeway really needs to get their act together, this is ridiculous.<//text>

They have electrical problems. I get shocked at least 3-4 times every time I go there, especially in the produce area. This safeway is the closest grocery store to me but I will now be going out of my way to shop elsewhere.</text>

(Translated by Google) Safeway unmanned cash registers have poor performance. Moreover, the point of the male assistant who manages the unmanned cash register is also bad at this store.
