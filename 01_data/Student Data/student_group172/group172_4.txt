I've been coming to place for years from way back when I still worked at Sam's. The food is just as good as I remember. It's always been my favorite spot for a cheesesteak.</text>

< Review>
Stopped in this place in between meeting clients. It caught my eye as I was driving down E 14th. I'm always down for a good Cheesesteak.

This place is nice and small, about five 4 tops. The place smells of meat and onions, not bad at all. All but one table was taken and there were people waiting for orders to go. The phone kept ring for pick up orders, so that's a good sign.

The food comes out rather quickly. The sandwich comes with hot crispy fries. They use a nice sourdough roll which was really good. I actually do prefer the Amoroso's rolls for a steak sandwich but this was good too. They also use a nice provolone cheese which I like but I think there should be a Cheez Whiz option too, I got the sandwich with mushrooms and bells.

It all went together very nicely but there was just a little something missing in flavor. It was a little bland for having that much going on.

The service was great, very friendly. Looks like a husband and wife team. The wife takes the orders at the counter and the husband cooks it all up.

I'll probably go back and give another steak sandwich a try.< /Review>

<Review>I ordered a "Lover's burger" and got something that looked more like a sandwich. It wasn't quite what I expected, but it was the best burger I've had in a long time and has changed my understanding of what defines a burger. It was big and extremely flavorful with wonderfully cooked meat plus 2 cheeses: Pastrami and American. I was left wondering how it was possible for something to be so tasty. I know this place is primarily for Cheese steaks so I'll have to come back and try one but I am definitely glad I got the burger. Also the curly fries were fantastic as expected.< /Review>< user_id>

Went today for the first time. $9.50 for the sandwich included fries. I upgraded them to cheesy fries for $1.25. Overall not super flavorful- nacho cheese on the fries not so good. The sandwhich didnt have much flavor. Not worth it too me.<//review>

The sandwiches are so good. If u want a gray Philly cheese steak that isn't dry, and is good until the last bite, this is the place. Very friendly owners too.</Review>

<Text>They need a cheese sauce vs just melting a slice of cheese on their sandwich. The price is pretty good since fries come with every sandwich. You can upgrade to curly fries or onion rings.<//Text>< name>

This place is delicious. I have been going since 2001 when I use to work across the street. My favs are the deluxe, the pizza and bbq cheesteak. I had a bbq last night and want another today it was so good but I live way in Fairfield. You gotta try it they been in business this long for a reason.<//review>

The service was fairly fast at 11:30 a.m. the sandwich had lots of meat cheese and mushrooms however, the bell peppers and mushrooms could have been sautéed along with the meat.The meat tasted a lot like the grill  which they cooked  on which left a burnt grill taste in my mouth that I didn't care for. The sandwich is a large portion  probably enough for two . The french fries were standard frozen fries,  fried but not greasy< /review>

When I was inside waiting for my deluxe to cook, I smelled something slightly funky.  When my food was finished cooking, I waited for it to cool a little bit and ate it...no issues until i started eating the 2nd half.  I tasted sour meat which usually is an indicator of spoiled meat, and it resembled the smell i had sensed.  Two stars might be too much for a place that makes hoagies out of spoiled meat.</text>

The food is good as long as you eat it while it's hot, otherwise is not as tasty. The fries that come with the order are like eating high school fries back in the day. So, I suggest to swap it for the curly or sweet potato fries they might be a better option. I tried the Philly Delux (#5) Cheese Steak sandwich which is good but I found a few minus that took away fom being fully satisfied with food. The amont of meat in the sandwich is lacking, this is noticeable when peeling back the layer of cheese. The bread is good but I felt it was too much bread but than again, I noticed it helped soak up the oil from the meat. I have also tried to the West Coast(#2), with chicken thigh, I found a lot better tasting than expected. This place has been around a long time and I noticed they have raised their prices and expanded their menu as well. Bottom line, if u feel like philly and want to support a local business try this place.< /review>

<review>Best hoagy steak place in the east bay! Maybe best in the whole bay area! Me and my friends and family are regulars. I usually get the mushroom chicken breast with swiss cheese onions and garlic added. Its the juiciest most flavorful chicken hoagy ever! The chicken is marinated in a teriyaki marinade then grilled over an open flame then chopped on the flat top grill to give it that amazing sear. It comes with fries that are nice and crispy. You can even get nacho cheese added to the fries, or even the sandwich! Great service. Great food. This might be the best hoagy shop in at least a 60mile radius..< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It is a shop where locals come to enjoy philly steak.
You can eat very good food at a reasonable price.
It is a very nice place to run by Korea.

(Original)
현지인들이 philly steak를 즐길때오는 가게입니다.
저렴한 가격에 아주 훌륭한 음식을 먹을수있습니다.
한국분이 운영하시는 곳으로 아주 친절합니다<//Review>

<Text>My wife and I had a taste for something sweet, so we thought about Nations and their pies! We drove to nation's, and the store is clean, and orderly... That's a good thing! The wait staff was courteous, and efficient... We got cherry cheesecake, and plain cheesecake... When we got home and tasted this food oh, we were pleasantly surprised! Extra good goodness in the cheesecakes!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Tried nations for the first time (through delivery) and had mixed thoughts. The burger itself was good, the bacon and cheese was crispy, bun was good and meat was flavorful. The fries definitely were disappointing, not sure if it’s because fries don’t travel well or if this is how it’s generally made but I’ve had better elsewhere. Onion rings were alright, but also likely doesn’t travel well. Milk shakes were very good! I think I need to try this food freshly made next time.</Text>

Okay, this place turned out to be unexpectedly good! I had breakfast, a ham and cheese and green chile omelet. Yum! The staff were exceptional. Great meal!<//Text>

Decent enough cheeseburger for the price. In tr typical Nations fashion took awhile to get order but that's what happens when it's made to order I suppose. Delicious pies!< /Text>

Awesomely great burgers!! A bit pricey but well worth the money!! Great cheesecake too, better than the other cheesecake place.
Build one in Elk Grove!! Instead we're having this other burger place to cause major traffic.<//text>

<Review>I've been there 3×'s in the past 2 weeks..I love it. Whether I order a Cheese burger 🍔,  or French Toast & Scrambled Eggs..it's been delicious every time. We have picked up pies too! They are soooo good ! We've had  a Pumpkin Cheesecake,  a French Apple Pie 🥧, & a Cheesecake w/Cherries on top. All are insanity yummy !!

In store dining available. Limited seating. Social distancing . I got salmon burger which the obligingly made a lettuce wrap with no mayo and grilled onion. 🤤 Scrumptious! for those watching their waist line. Others in my party had regular cheeseburgers and cheesecake. Results? YUMMY!< /text>

This joint has to be the worst in terms of food quality. BLT was soggy from how much mayo they put. Burgers have no flavor and a pound of mayo and onions. Fries have that fishy oily taste.</Text>

<response>None<//response><review>Thought i would give this burger place a try but probably going to be the last. Nothing special. Oh and for being the first time there it was not so great experience. There was a customer in front of us that didn't even have face covering and they still served him SMH. While he was ordering food he just pulled his sweater to cover his mouth then while waiting for his food did not cover his face pacing around talking on his phone. And they even have signs right in front of cashier saying face mask required. Did not see any manager at all. I don't think I would be going there again. If they don't follow protocol i think they won't last long even though they just opened.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Dr. Tom Hawj<//username></record></dataset><record>

Maybe the stars didn't align for me on this day but I've had nations many times before in the bay area and was looking forward to the nation's experience.. I ordered a cheese burger and it had way too much mayo, which wasn't a big deal.   the burger itself compared to all the other times, It just didn't taste like that yummy  nation's burger taste I'm used to. 😐</Text>

Service was extremely slow. Only 4 employees were working. The assistant manager wasn't doing his job they were making 1 order at a time. The door dash orders were first we waited 50 minutes and when we got our food it was ice cold. They didn't try to remake the food to compensate all he did was give a refund. Said he was to busy to remake the order for us. He said he was doing the best he can. Didn't try to do anything to make us happy. I'm so very upset and disappointed in Nations. I have been a customer of Nations chain for over 30 year's. I have never had this bad of service or this horrible of an experience.  There were also a few customers who weren't wearing thier masks. They only put it on to order the food. The restaurant was extremely busy people were trying to stay apart it was difficult with the restaurant closed off. I had to drive to Sonic to get my family some dinner. I was being reasonable due to the COVID situation but they were not accommodating at all. They really need to train their staff better.< /text>

Got a couple burgers, one was supposed to have bacon on it. The measly little piece that it had surely wasn't worth paying for. The bacon was barely cooked, too. My burger was good but the onion tasted a bit green. The onion rings were overcooked and almost too crispy hard to eat and the French fries were undercooked. I was a bit disappointed because I normally love Nation's.</Text>

A good burger but not a great burger as others have raved about.  I'd consider them just slightly above Carl's Jr in terms of taste and below Carl's re: price. Would like to rate them at 3.5 but Google Maps doesn't support that.< /Text>

Nice to have my favorite breakfast place in Natomas. Breakfast was ok, toast was a little stale. Also I have to remember that they don't season the hash browns or eggs. I should have asked for salt and pepper.<//review>

Ate her for the first time to see what the hype was about . I’m not satisfied, the burger was expensive , also hard and undercooked and the milkshake tasted like peer syrup.👎🏾👎🏾<//Review>

I have tasted three items so far and will review each item.

Giant Bacon Cheeseburger 11$ - The Burger was good, although at 11$ it really needs to be or else this would be a 1 star review, I will note there are other burgers and sandwiches that cost less that I will be trying at a later date. The size of the burger is certainly bigger than average, but I wouldn't describe it as giant.

Chilli Cheese Fries 8$ - Large potion of fries, The fries could use a bit more salt, but its good.

Chili Cheese Dog 9$ - This isn't really a standard chili cheese dog, it's a long hot dog, cut in half, on bread, smothered in cheese and chili, in a foam tray. It's like eating Chili with some bread and hot dog mixed in there, more than a hot dog with chili on it. Large portion and it's alright. I think it really depends on preference.

Will try more menu items at a later date.< /Text>

Food took way to long to come out (over 25 minutes) and the toast was just bread with melted butter. The cook was cooking 1 omelet at a time and standing there doing very little moving really slow, get a new breakfast cook for sure or i wont be going back.<//review>

Hamburgers were good but when we went the burgers were rapped poorly and everything fell out when grabbing them out of the bag. The food was decently good though.</Review>

<Review>When I got the truck back it seemed to shift hard.  Almost like I got hit by another car.
Very scary on the freeway.
It seems to jerk sometimes into gear and when they fixed it the problem was better but still broken.
Please drive it in the morning when it is cold before sending it back to me a third time.

My wife and I have leased or purchased 15 cars from Audi, Acura, Chevy, Ford, Honda, Kia, and now Parkway GMC. Our salesman Joseph, is hands down the best salesman we've had.  He was honest, fast, and didn't apply any pressure. Normally, I would've assumed we got lucky with Joseph, but we had the pleasure of meeting the owner. We chatted about different ways to conduct business, our families, and our K9 children. The vision at Parkway is clear and it starts at the top. Be honest and treat customers like family. GMC Parkway may be the 1st dealership to practice what they preach.< /text>

Lydia is an awesome asset to your team! She is very personal and I feel like I’ve know her my whole life “she’s amazing” thank you Lydia!!!! I’ve always liked Parkway. The owner sorry don’t remember his name but when I purchased my Yukon 5th car I have purchased at Parkway he helped the not so great salesman I had. The owner is amazing also so thank you!! My husband is going to be purchasing a new GMC truck soon and we will be buying it from Parkway😊<//Text>

<review>Absolutely the worst dealership we have dealt with. We reached out to the dealership via phone regarding a vehicle on the website. Spoke with Mustafa and set up same day visit to see the vehicle. Since I was traveling over an hour to get to the dealership I asked for confirmation that the vehicle would be available when I got there. Upon arrival I saw the truck in the lot and was greeted by Mustafa. He said he was going to grab the keys while we were looking at the vehicle. He returned and said someone was in the process of buying the vehicle after we drove all the way over.<//review><rating>1<//rating><username>Ashley La Soya</username><pictures>None</pictures><gmapID>0x80c2876a9698e9cf:0x746f91415e338241<//gmapID>< Resp>

Absolutely deplorable experience with this dealership. Called to purchase a vehicle that was in stock and pricing advertised. First, the salesperson tried to say the vehicle was in high demand and therefore the price would be above MSRP. When I explained that they are advertising the price online on both their own website and through gmc.com, they eventually reluctantly agreed to sell me the vehicle at the advertised price. After running our credit and waiting for paperwork from the finance guy, we didn’t hear anything back. I called to find out that the vehicle had been sold to someone else. When I tried to reach the salesperson and manager to get an explanation, they refused to return my calls. Shady, underhanded and sketchy are the words that describe my experience. Shame on you for running such an awful experience for customers. We bought the vehicle from a different dealer and had a wonderful experience elsewhere. Buyer beware this dealership!<//Review>

Came in Saturday for a test drive, Randy approached us to help out. Great guy to deal with, answered all my questions, didn't pressure me at all. Gave me all the possible options I can get to save as much as I can. Took the truck the following day with a smile in my face. I'm glad I went to Parkway GMC.<//text>

We have decided to purchase a new vehicle and over the last 2 weeks have been to over 10 different dealerships from Fresno to Valencia and Parkway GMC was the worse experience by far.  I was amazed at how poorly the potential purchasing process was handled and the lack of knowledge pertaining to the vehicle pricing the rep had, not to mention how extremely mismanaged the entire process was handled.</Review>

<review>Didn’t come to buy a car, actually delivered some food for a guy there. But, I can for sure that these people are some of the nicest folk I’ve met. At the Mercedes dealership I had people follow my every move and got slightly harassed for not knowing where to drop off the food. But at the gmc dealership they kindly lead straight to the buyer of the food and even sent me off with “have a good day”. Everyone was polite and didn’t give me dirty looks for not having superb attire. God bless y’all and make some sales!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Unfortunate I had a bad experience trying to buy a pick up truck from this dealer. So I checked their inventory on line and contacted one of the gentleman from a previous visit. I checked and confirmed the price with this gentleman including additional discounts, so I decided to visit the dealer with my checkbook in hand ready for the purchase. When I get there I was told by one of the sales reps that the truck was there. But that the price on the internet was not it. He said he had other people trying to buy it. Then I told him about the price shown online. I told him about the employee price offer by gmc, and he asked me “ are you a gmc employee ?” I said “no” He said the price is for employees only. And I told him the employee price was the offer for everyone trying to buy a car. That’s the way I read it on their website. Well, he said the price was the regular MSRP. Honestly I had better expectations from this GMC dealer. The price msrp was $62,220 and after cash allowance and employee discount it showed the price of $53,724 I told him it was false advertisement, and I left very disappointed.< /Review>< pictures>

Cadillac is a pretender, they are no way close to being a true luxury car division. I like their cars as to way I drive one. Their service is something else to consider. It should work hand in hand.</text>

Great experience, excellent customer service. My husband and I were looking to upgrade to a bigger vehicle, and went to Parkway GMC to see what they had. Mustafa was extremely knowledgeable and helpful with all our questions and concerns in regards to the Yukon XL. We were able to find what we needed on the lot. His manager Chaz made the application and approval process extremely easy, and was very pleasant to speak with as well as accommodating with all the additional questions we had. Lastly, the finance manager Hany was straight forward and had us out of there in no time, appreciated his funny humor and ease with all the small details. Again extremely pleasant experience, they have earned our loyalty, businness and respect. Definitely will recommend to anyone who needs a vehicle.< /text>

Since google won’t let me leave another review, I thought I would update my review.
I always have a great experience when I come in and get my car serviced by Lydia! She’s the sweetest and always goes the extra mile. I drive an hour to come to this location just for the service.
Thank you again Lydia for always making it easy and being so accommodating!!!</Text>

<Text>Our GMC was giving us issues and we took it in to our trusty service advisor, Lydia and she took care of us!  She is wonderful!  We can always trust her judgement when it comes to our car.  The dealership is wonderful as well, we like working with Randy.  Everybody at the dealership has always been pleasant to work with.  Would highly recommend Lydia, Randy, and Parkway!<//Text>< time>

<Text>Steve Keefe a quite "Rock Star" that has a heart of gold and in my opinion should win "Father of the Year" every day of every year.

My daughters went here on yesterday and purchased a vehicle! I’m in Houston and I normally make these decisions for my girls, however the gentleman out there handled everything superbly! They even included GAP coverage on the vehicle, because it was my daughters birthday! I spoke with the sales manager over the phone and he assured me that they were in the right hands and would be taken care of without any issues!! As we all know purchasing a Vehicle can get stressful And lengthy, well one of my daughters is a diabetic. Her blood sugar went low from being at the dealership all day, and the staff went above and beyond getting her snacks and what ever she needed to get back home safely! Thanks guys!! Shout out to Danny Geris and Nick Vondra! You guys rock!! Thanks again, all the way from Houston Texas!🤘🏽< /Text>

Sales consultant Danny Brice was extremely helpful and patient showing us vehicles we were interested in leasing.  I've purchased/leased several cars from Danny when he worked at other Parkway dealerships and always look him up when it's time to get a new vehicle.

Worst experience ever.
I was there first day I decided I wanted to buy a new car.
I have to say I’ve never had a more hostile terrible experience when buying a car.
This hispanic sales person that showed us the car was very rude, he seemed annoyed for me asking for options, rates and best deal possible. I don’t know if he just hate his life or just he didn’t like us. I don’t know but he was super rude. I left very upset and took my business else where.
That weekend I bought my wife a new 2019 Buick Enclave at Thousand Oaks Buick dealership and it was the most beautiful experience for me my wife and kids. We where treated fine and they made us feel like our business is appreciated.
I don’t know if is just a business shady practice that they don’t offer their best price at the beginning unless absolutely necessary or it was just a this particular employee thing.< /text>

Park way's service department is great.   I purchased my Terrain from them in 2010 and have continually counted on them to take great care of me and my car.  I have only once had a warranty issue with my car and Sean rectified my account immediately and credited me.  I got an oil change and changed my break pads this past weekend and was very pleased with the service I received from Justin.  I appreciate that they are always honest and advise me on what's best for my vehicle, which on many occasions resulted in money savings for me.  Due to the great customer service, I will continue to take my vehicle to them!</Text>

They said my brake pads are at 3mm but other mechanic said they were at 7mm with 50% of life left on the pads.

If you’re looking to buying a car from a dealer that has work ethics, then this is the place. I can’t say enough good things about this place. We purchased our Yukon a few days ago from them and so far so good! Our salesman Scott was amazing, he waited for us after his work hours to show us the car and take it for a test drive, and gave us all info about the car and answered all our questions. Then we talked to the financial manager Hany to do the purchase and he was amazing and very kind. he explained to us where each penny we pay goes to, and answered all our questions.
We highly recommend this place if you want a peace of mind!<//Text>

We get a call an hour away from the dealer saying someone was making a deal on it, although they said they would hold it. Anthony the manager really wasnt much help in trying to find anything else either. He calls back 30 minutes later saying the deal didnt go through. Okay, we get the car. BUT, they gave me the wrong spare FOB and were no help in trying to replace it. Trying to make us drive back out there for a small window period on Friday between 12-2 so they can "maybe" fix it. So we had to just take the loss. Now not even a week later (Thursday of the same week) and the car battery is faulty & needs to be replaced.

<rate>2<//rate><Text>I had a bad experience from buying my car last year, wishing I went somewhere else, but I ended up getting “free” oil changes for life with the dealership and boy do I regret it! I scheduled my appointment for today at 7AM, I get here AT 7AM, but car is not taken back until 7:35 for the oil change... still not done and it’s been almost an hour. Coming from a girl who would do her own oil changes on her Honda, this is ridiculous! It DOES NOT take an hour for a oil change and a tire rotation(that’s recommend with the “free” oil changes) also their services fees are extremely high compared to their parts. They quoted me $568 to change out some filters and change out some fluids, that I then bought myself and changed on my own. If the techs aren’t there at 7AM for services being rendered, don’t have the option to schedule a 7AM appointment.<//Text>< pics>

I have purchased cars from other dealerships and so far Parkway is exceptional.  Randy Bergeron, the Internet Sale Manager  who assisted me in my purchase  was awesome and great. I did not ask to test drive my new GMC Acadia as I know and felt I was in good hands.   Finance Manager, Markus  was also accommodating and friendly.  So far I love my new car.  It runs great!!!   I will definitely recommend this dealership to my family and friends.<//text>

Folks are always helpful, and they listen to the customer, which is important to me.  Always keep me up to date on the status of my truck, and follow up by phone to make sure the service provided met my expectations.

While repairing a radiator a few months ago, the technician broke the fan.  No excuses, just an honest explanation, and and apology.  Things happen, and I appreciated the accountability and integrity.

The entire team works hard to ensure a positive customer experience.  I'd highly recommend this dealership to a family member or friend.</Text>

I've always been a little skeptical about taking my car to any mechanic shop, but my transmission was going out in my 2005 Chevy Colorado. So I needed to take it to a mechanic. I had taken it to a few mechanics to have it looked at and to see about getting it fixed but it seemed like they were giving me the runaround and really wouldn't give me an honest answer about the price so finally I ended up taking it to Parkway. Parkway Cadillac Buick GMC, made me feel comfortable, really friendly and good customer service Darren service writer who wrote me up was very nice and give me a straight answer with the price. Plus getting a certified Transmission really made a difference. Having this experience, I wish I would have just taking it there in the first place. I'm very satisfied customer.</text>

I bought a new Yukon Denali that I had to order to get exactly the equipment I wanted.  Everything went very smoothly.  Our salesman, Randy, was very knowledgeable & answered all of our questions.

I had the most amazing experience.  I was given their information by a friend, to amuse them I started texting one of their sales reps.  In a few hours I had a car, at a great price and drove over an hour to sign papers.  They were on it all the way through the process.  I love my Enclave and while I won't be buying a new car for a few years, I will send everyone to Randy who wants to buy one.< /review>

The techs did a great job on the repair and maintenance of my vehicle.  The shop called me tell me that my car was done.  Upon arrival, I had to wait for one of the techs to drive back from his house because he accidentally took my car key with him.  Besides that inconvenience, everything else seems to be fine.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I took my mom's car in on 05/03/2013 and I have to say I was quite impressed with how nice and friendly EVERYONE was.  I was there for quite a few hours the first day and was allowed to use a table in a conference room to do my paperwork while I waited.  Kathy and Marianne were so sweet they even offered me something to eat from their very own personal food.  Everyone really made an impression on me to the point I sent my friend a text letting them know how wonderful everyone was.  She wrote back, "It sounds like they're treating my friend very well."

I would like to thank EVERYONE at Parkway Motors (Pontiac) for making what is usually a miserable experience actually very pleasant.  Straight from the service advisers Robert, Tina, Miguel to your wonderful cashiers Kathy and Marianne to Randy for being so pleasant and friendly while eating lunch in the conference room with us, right on down to Alex who drove me home and picked me up the next day and was so friendly and personable.

I must say I had an unusually pleasant experience having mom's car serviced!

Thanks y'all.  Keep up the excellent work.  :)

Well i drove over 35 min to get there for my apt at 9:30. When i made my apt. i asked them how long an oil change would be.  They told me 1 1/2 hours. I arrive and there is no place to sit so i stand and wait for someone to help me.  She finally helps me and tells me it will be at least 3 hours.  I said you told me 1 1/2 hours. She said well we have 15 other vehicles.  So my question is why do we make apts if they are not honored and how did 15 people get in front of me to push me back if they already told me 1 1/2 hours. Needless to say i walked out and left unsatisfied!   Makes me wish i had my Equinox back.  There i made an apt. walked in sat down and my car was being worked on as i spoke to the service agent.  What  a huge difference.<//text>

Had a great experience with Parkway and my service manager Linda. Linda was quick to respond, helpful and a pleasure to work with. Even the operator who answered the phone when I was trying to have my car towed over at 6:00pm on a Friday night kept trying to find me a service manager and found me one.
Thank you Parkway!<//Review>

DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!!!THEY ARE CHEATERS!!!!!!

My perfect credit score got ruined because of them. I leased a Escalade from them and they made a mistake on the paper work damaging my credit score. I try to contact them several times but never got a phone back. I'm very disappointed! They just want you to buy and then they disappear. Not professional at all. My new car came with a lot of scratches that they just try to cover it up with paint and it came of a couple of days after. THEY ARE CHEATERS!!!!!<//Text>

<Text>I hate haggling over the lease/purchase of a vehicle.  I'm sure you do too.  I walked into Parkway GMC with a picture of an offer for a Terrain from another dealership and showed it to Steve who said without hesitation "we will beat their offer because we want to earn your business".  Transactions take a while people, you have to be patient while salesmen enter 17 digit VIN numbers and your information for the lease/purchase of a car.  They're working to make the numbers work....and that's exactly what they did for us.  This vehicle makes our 4th lease....and we couldn't be happier with the service we receive from everyone at this dealership.<//Text>< pictures>

I absolutely hate the car buying process, but today was different. Still a long process, but our salesman, Vidal was terrific!  He was patient, knowledgeable and very respectful of our requirements.  He explained answered all of our questions, without double talk.  I got an unbelievable deal on a Cadillac ATS, and couldn't be happier.  The sales manager, George was extremely reasonable and fair, not to mention very friendly.   We had very reasonable and non-contentious negotiations.  Finally to the "dreaded finance"....not this time; Hany was terrific and even recommended a lower priced warranty, because of my driving habits.  Who does that?   Hany does!  I will definitely be back and highly recommend you check them out when you're in the market for a Cadillac!<//Text>

LEMON ALERT!!!!
Service is a scam! I Extended warranty is a scam!!
I paid thousands for an extended bumper to bumper warranty that every fix has been refused so far.
I have had the Tahoe for less than a year.  The wheels were unbalanced and
unfix-able so a month later they finally changed the rims completely with a different look and less tread.
I had the brakes replaced 60 days 1,500 miles later (Not covered)
I have the oil changed a few months later and the fuel system is faulty (Not Covered) The Oil System is leaking (Not Covered)
Last month I took it in for an oil change and a service diagnostic check to see why the oil is disappearing.  I paid $165 and no solution except that it is not covered under the extended warranty.  Linda Monsell was unwilling to give me a copy of the diagnostic done to get a second opinion since they were asking hundreds of dollars to fix this LEMON of a Tahoe.
I have sent complaints to 7 different government agencies and have investigation numbers from two of them.  Hoping to get something finally resolved ASAP.< /text>

Have bought two trucks here and will buy my next truck here also. Always treated like family always taken care of. Sales and service always meet or exceed my expectations. Service is always taken care of within the timeframe they give me always on time. Love coming here for my maintenance needs. Know that it's getting done right and by people that care about their customers not just your money  hovik and Linda in service are awesome.  Randy in sales works miracles  I'd definitely recommend coming here and experience the difference from other dealerships< /review>

A word of caution...

In an effort to spare someone else the trouble I experienced, I am writing this review. I recently contacted Valencia Cadillac regarding the purchase of a vehicle. I had taken the time to customize the car to my personal tastes and didn't want any issues when it came time to finalize the sale. I also wanted to be thoroughly prepared, so I spoke with a friend who works at a financial institution. He took the time to run my credit and advise me of my options in terms of financing- credit score, interest rates and monthly payments.

Unfortunately, the transaction was anything but smooth. When the car was ready, I advised Don that I wanted to pay for the car in cash. He outright refused to sell me the car in cash stating that the dealership would make no profit and he was not willing to do that. Don said that my only option was to finance the vehicle. Despite the fact that that this wasn't ideal for me, I had already gone through the trouble of customizing the car, so I heard him out. Don told me that because I already received the GM family discount, he wasn't going to shop for rates and I had to finance through him, which I know to be absolutely false. The rate that offered was several percentage points higher than what I know I qualify for. This is unacceptable. I could postulate on the reasons why Valencia Cadillac was doing their best to take advantage of me, but I won't. Whatever the reason it is; they are wrong.

As someone who is in the market for a new car every five years, their lack professionalism and ethical business practice means they not only lose out on repeat business, but also others that I feel obligated to caution against them. Ultimately, I went to another dealer and had a much better experience. I purchased the car that I wanted at a rate that was more in line with what my research yielded. Don't make the same mistake it did - save yourself time, and choose another dealership.< /review>

<text>Went in for my first free service on my gmc 2500 h.d.- oil change/tire rotation. The mechanic did not tighten my center caps properly and lost one. The other three were loose. Beware if you have aftermarket wheels as I do. Only reason for 2 starts and not one was the lady was sweet at the counter.</text>< Pics>

A great dealership: Both the sales and service department are first class.  I have been purchasing my vehicles here since 2002 and Parkway by far has the best service department in SoCal- friendly, courteous and efficient.<//Text>

< review>
I had one of THE BEST car "leasing" experiences at Parkway GMC this past January 2017, with salesperson, Martin Hernandez.  Martin worked well with me on the negotiating end.  I was very happy with his not trying to play any games - as so many others often pull...  For example; Casa Cadillac GMC in Sherman Oaks was absolutely pathetic!   Martin demonstrated the car's features very well.  The entire staff at Parkway were friendly.  The finance guy was terrific - as he didn't try to oversell me on anything I didn't want.  Overall, it was a very smooth process of getting out of my old Acadia lease and into my new 2017 Acadia SLE-2.  I will definitely be back again in 2020 for my next  SUV.  I HIGHLY recommend this dealership!  I have dealt with many other dealerships and by far...this was one of the best!!  Thank you, Martin and Co.!

Randy Bergeron is the person you want to work with.  He is professional and friendly.  He is the reason why I am driving a 2017 GMC Terrain for the
next three years after turning in my 2014 GMC Terrain.  The main thing a customer wants is to be able to trust the salesperson.  I trust Randy Bergeron and the service department at Parkway.< /Review>

Everyone including Kathy listened to my concerns and about the past treatment I received and took charge on correcting what was previously not address.

Thank you to Kathy,Greg, and Miguel for listening and finally getting my breaks taken care of. Meant alot for it to be address, I carry precious cargo everyday in my car my grandson. All your efforts are greatly appreciated< /Review>< pics>

Just bought my 2nd car from them and we  have been dealing with Parkway since 2005. They are easy to work with and very honest.My salesperson was Scott Brimigion , Scott is very knowledgeable and talented. Quick and easy to work with. He took the time to get me the truck I was looking for. The have a very large inventory off lot  so if you dont see what your looking for when you drive by go in and see him...<//Review>

< Review>
Quite amazed at the negative posts on Yelp.  I am on my second Buick from Parkway.  Both have been serviced only at Parkway.  Recently my 2011 LaCrosse sat in the garage for a week and the battery went dead.  Had it jump started and was showing all sorts of electrical power issues the following week.  This morning to Parkway for service and verified the battery needed to be replaced.  I have the 100k mile warranty but the battery is 3yr/36 month only.  Having 42k miles on the car the battery was out of warranty.  Cost nearly $200.00.  Went to pick up the car when it was ready and Gary the Service Advisor told me that there would be no charge for the battery, not even a pro-rated batter exchange charge!
This is only one example of my experiences with Parkway GM over the last 10 years.  There are many, many more.
Thank you Gary, Maryanne, and all of the others there who have served me over the last 10 years.<//Review>

We have had a long relationship with Parkway.  From our first purchase back in 2002 when we drove away in a brand new Yukon to our most recent purchases (2016 GMC Enclave and Certified VW Passat) we couldn't be happier with the attention and service we have received at Parkway.  More importantly, I appreciate the knowledge of the technicians and mechanics that have serviced my car.

Thank you, Parkway!!</text>

<Review>Labor Day Weekend 2013:  Purchased a 2010 Honda Pilot from the Kia Dealership.  Great salesperson and the sales manager eager to make sale worked with us.  The car only has 28,000 miles on it.  However, upon heading home, and the subsequent days after, I realized the front rotors needed to be turned because when stopping the steering wheel vibrated.  We talked to our sales person about this and he allowed us to bring our Honda to the Kia service department and he took care of the rotor problem free of charge.  This was customer service at it's highest right there. I was very impressed and would not hesitate to go there again.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Worst dealership I have ever been to. They are crooks! They covered the warranty part on my Denali but not the other parts that were damaged because of the  warranty item being defective. The only thing worse then the dealership was GMC customer service pretending to try and help! Never again!! I was told that other dealerships might have fixed the other issues under warranty, it was a dealership call.</Text>

New service advisors are very helpful and informative.  Michelle kept us well informed as the car changed status and needed more work than anticipated.  Shuttle was convenient too.  Great at follow thru with ext. warranty coverage and claims.   Elizabeth was wonderful in the cashier booth-- flexible and patient with questions.
Tip: when picking up car that's had oil change, check it immediately in the info display to see that it shows 100% oil life.  Sometimes the tech forgets to reset this control value, even tho he did physically change the oil.</text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
In my 73 years, I have purchased 6 new vehicles and would have acquired more had it not been for bad experiences with car salesmen and various dealerships.  The tactics and high pressure you were subjected to made getting dual root canals more appealing.
From the start, the whole buying experience at Parkway was very personable.  Randy Bergeron and the entire staff treated us like friends and the usual high pressure tactics employed at other dealerships was nonexistent.
This dealership and its staff could well serve as the poster child for what the car buying
experience should be.  If I experience the same degree of care when I have my vehicle serviced there, they will have gained a lifetime customer.

Went in knowing exactly which car we wanted to buy ( picked from dealer inventory online), a pre-negotiated price (through USAA car buying service) and financing pre-arranged and ready to go with our bank.  Somehow with everything ready on our end before stepping foot at the dealership and no haggling required it still took nearly 4 hours to buy our car.</review>

New 1 star review:
I have to retract my previous review. I brought my brand-new cadillac in for it's first scheduled maintenance at Parkway, and the service department turned out to be very untrustworthy. Let me explain my proof: A few weeks previous, I got a flat on one of my tires. It was just a nail so the tire was repaired with a rubber plug. The problem with rubber plugs is they slowly let  little air out as you drive. That is the front passenger side tire, it was down about 5 psi compared to the rest. I took my car in for the first scheduled maintenance at 7400 miles, dropped the car off to the service department. They contacted me about an hour and a half later and said it was ready for pick up. I picked up the car, they gave me the "multi-point vehicle inspection" sheet that had check marks for all points of the inspection and service. Everything was marked as "green" or checked and at specs. I got in my car, and immediately noticed that the tire pressure readout was identical to when I dropped it off, the front passenger tire was still down 5 psi. A little deductive reasoning and you realize that they did not do 2 things: check the tire pressure of all the tires and rotate the tires. I brought the car back to the service department, they tried to say they forgot to "reset" the TPMS (the Cadillac has an active TPMS that always reports the exact pressure on your dashboard for each tire, no need to reset it), I told them I did not accept that and I wanted them to properly inflate the tires AND do the rotation. They took the car back for another half hour then returned it. The tires were now all reading 35 PSI. Fast forward a couple weeks... the same front passenger tire has dropped 3 PSI. That means they never did the same rotation. Now, when someone lies like this, it makes you wonder if they also lied about anything else on that multi-point inspection. On top of that, my car is now leaking oil. I do not know the cause but I suspect strongly that the service department did not do the oil change correctly. I'm having GM tow the car now to another dealership sevice department to have them re-do the service. My advice? Steer clear of the Parkway Motors Service department!!

Previous 5 star review:
I just purchased my 2013 Cadillac SRX from Parkway, and I had the smoothest transaction ever at a car dealership. Patrick Todd was the salesman and he was the best! No-pressure, no upsell hell, just a clean and fast deal! I knew exactly what I wanted and which options, and let him know. I wanted a color that is usually not on the lot, so I had to have it built from scratch. Patrick said it would be 6-8 weeks till delivery. He ordered my Caddy and I waited for it to arrive. It arrived 1 week early, and I went in. Gave it a test drive, and said I wanted to purchase. 1 hour later and it was mine!! Hany Wahba the Finance guy made the financing go so smoothly! I have never even imagined that a deal could be done with no headache like that! I got a low rate and terms that were perfect. I was ready to get my own financing if the terms were out of line, they were not! I will recommend these guys to everyone I know! Thanks for my new SRX!!!<//Text>

I took my escalade for a routine service while under warranty. A month later, after warranty expired the car needed new brakes and the rotors were damaged. No clear explanation of why this was missed during their inspection, the manager never returned the calls.
Funny how while under warranty things get missed!!!<//text>

Not Happy, GM has a problem with COP {Coil on Plug} in 2009 Buick Enclave. This causes the Engine to " MISS FIRE " at 1800 RPM's under load. Dealer cannot fix this because it does not create a Engine Warning Alert in the Computer. Only way to fix is to replace ALL COILS and PLUGS, VERY EXPENSIVE. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<//text>

<Text>I Ordered a torta de lengua, 2 lengua tacos and 2 pastor tacos 🌮. Everything was divine! The tacos were made with handmade tortillas. Great spot. I’m glad I tried it. Will definitely be going back. Only thing I guess was an issue was the parking situation but during quarantine I guess it’s not an issue.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< user_name>

Just moved to the area and already found a great spot. I have only had the tacos so far, but the meat & ingredients here taste so fresh. Definitely a good hole-in-the-wall restaurant.</Text>

< Review>
Worst service ever. Very dirty n filthy establishment. Staff did not explain that you need a code to pick up my pizza and  they ignored me for an additional 10 minutes. Then said that they need to confirm that it’s my pizza as if I’m going to steal some random persons pizza. Very disappointed. Definitely NOT going back to this place. I left angry and frustrated. East 18th Street has way better service and food.< /Review>

<text>The place smelled bad and looked shabby. The lady up front was rude and very slow. I could put up with all that.  It was when I took my pizza home.  Iv reheated a little Caesars pizza before and know for a fact my stale pizza was old and reheated. It did not even look appealing. Took a couple of bites and was too disappointed to eat and now my stomach is acting up. Took pictures of this abomination of a pizza and its clearly old. The cheese is discolored and rubbery. If I get sick I'm gonna sue this establishment<//text>< Name>

Who doesn't love a good deal on pizza at that. They only messed up on our soda we wanted that we purchased as we were leaving. Pizza was hot and fresh and right now if you order online they got a coupon for free breadsticks. Its okay sometimes to just order the bread sticks and sauce, I do it all the time there addictive. Staff was great and made sure my oder was correct before leaving. If you order online super quick and ready when you get there.</Text>

<text>The worst service I have ever encountered!!!! The girl at the register asked me can I help you, so I say two bags of garlic sticks, so instead of getting my order she turns around goes to the back where you can see everything and starts getting pizzas ready for the box and starts cutting the pizzas, tthen she starts filling other orders, I eat this for about 3 minutes when I ask what about my order, she says there were others ahead of me, I asked why then did you ask me what I want, and the garlic bread was ready and only 4 feet away from us, she didn't care and she didn't speak English very well either, I just turned and left. Another food establishment where the counter person doesn't say hello may I please help you with a smile. Unacceptable!!!< /text>< pics>

I bought a 5$ lunch combo today and I usually buy them at Brentwood but I was in Antioch and decided to buy a combo I was unfortunate to have went there and bought this combo the pizza was disgusting and tasted like if it was made 2 days ago my friend took one bite of it because I thought I was the only one with this taste and my friend immediately threw up and I ate one slice and threw the rest away because It tasted badly I hope you guys actually do your pizzas right and fresh because I’m always buying lunch combos at the same time and place which is in Brentwood and they taste amazingly fresh and good first time buying the 5$ combo at this place never will again 😕</text>

Called placed order, told me ready in 15 mins, I get there, pick it up, and since I'm hungry grab a slice, while in my car, 15-20 mins after I placed the order. Pizza was cold, and dry. So I guess they just had it made and happy I ordered the same one. And no, it was not a Hot and Ready. It was a Legit pizza. So I expect it to be made to order. But whatever. Jalapeño Cheese Sticks were bomb that's why it gets 3 stars. Hahaha<//review>

Well the first problem I encountered was when i walked in , there was no one at the front counter to greet me or talk to me. It was about a minute later that they came over to take my order. After talking to the greeter , she told me 7 minutes and went to the back to presumably make my order. After a few people came in to pick up their order 7 minutes had elapsed. it would be another 10 minutes before I would get my order. And when they handed it to me, they just threw it on the table and the lady walked off.  I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION EVER.<//text>

Warren is by far the most distracted person ever. His receptionist are good people but when they can’t get his attention or and when they do he doesn’t give a straight answer. It took me two months to get a no from him. Basically I got taken for a diagnostic fee and they didn’t even make the repairs. Even though I told them what was wrong with the car. At the end of this warren wanted extra time that he couldn’t justify. I guess he couldn’t explain that being distracted was gonna cost an extra 5 hours of labor.  From the start I ask if he had the time to get this repair done or if he could even handle it. My advice if you plan on using this place ask for someone other then warren to tend to it.</text>

{'time': 1627507928887, 'text': "Hello Javier: You purchased a used vehicle that developed an overheating condition the first week. The first shop was unable to repair your vehicle so you brought it to me. We correctly diagnosed a failed head gasket. Your insurance adjuster came out and verified my diagnostic. I explained to you that with no vehicle history I was concerned the previous owner traded in the car because of high repair cost. We agreed the motor should be replaced however your insurance company would not pay for a new motor, only used. You agreed to pay the difference. When I asked for a deposit you declined. We gave you a second estimate to install a used long block but that's not what we received. We received a entire used engine. We gave you a third estimate for the addition time to prepare the used engine for installation. Again you declined. Every time I gave you an estimate you agreed until I asked for a deposit. Javier the proper way to purchase a used vehicle is to have it completely inspected by a competent shop and read your insurance policy prior to the purchase. Doing that would have prevented your situation. Your insurance company refused our recommendations and estimates. We were capable, willing and 2 months patient. I never worked on your vehicle, only diagnosed.\nSorry for any miscommunications and inconvenience.     Warren Parr"}</Response>

<response>{'time': 1627517934675, 'text': 'Hello Grace: I am sorry for our poor performance. This year Complete Car Care has been disseminated by unrelated to the job injuries. I suffered a detached retina and my service writer suffered a back injury. It was from day to day if we would be fully staffed or not. On occasion this created some inconsistencies in our scheduling and created some large jog jams. It certainly wasn\'t by design and I hate it. Since your review I hired 1 new office staff member and the communication and inconsistencies have much improved. My eye sight has been much more difficult. I need a 2nd eye surgery but have been prevented from doing so due to Covid-19 restrictions. The surgery is considered elective. I\'m hoping everything, including my eye sight,  will return to normal by Thanksgiving. Grace, if you will give us a second chance I will try and make it right. Regarding the statement "I felt robbed", that very much concerns me. I started my business because I wanted to help people. Even if you are not interested in returning as a customer I would still be interested in your concerns with our invoice. I\'m willing to try and make that right also.

Only came here because I like to support small family owned businesses. I was a customer of Ball tire for over 10yrs and Loved them but unfortunately the Pandemic happened. Let me start off by saying the customer service at this business is almost non existent. No communication on what was going to be done or what was done. They locked my key in the car & I had to go take them my spare. I felt robbed at the price I paid for the work done. I would probably never solicit this business again. Mostly because I like things to be explained to me. I like to know what I'm paying for. The paper given was mechanic talk.<//Review>

<review>I was delighted to find someone who fixes vehicles instead of just replacing entire units. Aparently rebuilding something is foreign to the car dealers. Complete Car Care does a thorough inspection before doing any work, sends you photos and a detailed check list. The pick up and delivery service is wonderful.<//review><user_id>107324407289016079090</user_id>< GmapID>

<Text>My daughter was rear-ended in an accident. We took it here to have the car checked for any damage done underneath the car.
They said it was all good to our insurance company NO DAMAGE FOUND. The auto collision shop FOUND DAMAGE TO HER GAS TANK underneath the car. I'm truly disappointed because we believed it was okay Really disappointed!! They didn't really give the car the checkup we thought they did.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

today i shopped around and went to Complete Auto Care for a pre-purchase vehicle inspection and was very pleased with the service and the candid expertise at the shop. I brought in an 09 camry hybrid and the mechanic (an experienced, transparent fellow) was very meticulous about providing me a quality prognosis on the current state of the vehicle.  They were able to squeeze me in when i needed it and the price was fair - 60 dollars for the inspection. They also provide a 4% discount for Cash transactions so it was 57 total.

I find it important to share this with all of you because i literally spent two hours calling about 20 different mechanic shops here in fresno and this one gave me one of the better rates in addition to the prompt service. i found out about this shop through a referral by an acquaintance.< /text>

It has taken us years of battle trying to find an honest trustworthy mechanic and a company with the same morals and heart like us to work on our truck and we finally found the best people. This company will not tell you that you need something when you don’t. We were with another company that could not get our truck to pass smog and fix a sensor that wouldn’t turn our check engine light off. These guys fixed everything in a couple days at an 1/8 of the price the other guys wanted to charge us. Being a small business owner ourself we wanted to share with the world how awesome this company is. We won’t go anywhere else! Thanks Complete Car Care!< /Review>

<review>First experience was good. However within the last 2 months I’ve taken my truck to them to replace the O2 sensors and after one week a code reappeared indicating a code failure again! This happened 3 times!! After the code lit a 4th time I went somewhere else and it was fixed correctly. Come to find out, they installed the wrong part! 3 times!! I’ve been trying to reach Warren to discuss the bill, which I paid, for  3 weeks but he hasn’t made time to even call me back. Despite reassurances from Billy that they will make it right, the lack of communication makes me wonder. 👍👍👍 I am happy to report we have resolved the problem and I am satisfied with the outcome.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I called Complete Car Care due to my check engine light coming on. Billy walked me step by step as to exactly what the process of them fixing the problem with my car was before I even stepped foot in the shop, which earned my trust. Before this I called 8 other shops and the person on the phone was ether mean or didn't really want to give me details.  Finally after the car was diagnosed they told me the amount I was going to have to pay and how long it would take. I was not charged a cent more and they were punctual! I own a mini cooper which limits me to the shops I am able to take my care into, but they worked on it no problem, and did a great job. My car is running amazingly and I was very happy with the customer service and the work this shop provides!</review>< pictures>

<Review>Had an AC service done there as my unit was only blowing out warm air. Yuk!! Employee Warren there not only picked up my vehicle at home and delivered it back  with AC working great, he went over the whole job with me in detail. That's service. Made me feel very comfortable about the whole thing, and so much so that today they are replacing my rusty and leaky radiator and  servicing the whole cooling system. Their prices are very reasonable and you can be confident that the quote for the service remains virtually the same as the final price. I am very pleased with their service and all the care and attention they deliver. Billy there does a great job coordinating the whole job from beginning to end. I certainly recommend Complete Car Care for all your car service.   :)< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1560789172232, 'text': "Hey there Big Don, I saw that review from you on yelp Saturday!!

<Review>Skilled & knowledgeable mechanics. They do honest work, and charge a fair rate. I brought in my 2006 Kia Rio with a recurring check engine light with fault code P0497 low purge flow and other EVAP system related codes. This was a complex and difficult problem requiring multiple solutions and Complete Car Care accurately diagnosed the multitude of problems and got the repairs completed when others could not. Other shops told me straight out that they didn't have any technicians with the ability to do this type of repair. I highly recommend taking your vehicle to Complete Car Care. You'll be glad you did.< /Review>< pics>

The guys here are Awesome and service is Wonderful. A center where they seem to really care about the customer and their vehicle. I Had gotten a really bad coolant leak late at night that pushed my water temp to the max. I searched for a Napa store so I could get the coolant reccomended for my Dodge Ram 2500 Cummims engine. Saw this service center come up and decided to check them out when they opened. Best decision I could have made! Billy & Warren are absolutely amazing technicians! What we thought may have been a busted head gasket due to overheating along with the coolant leak thankfully was just a a busted hose and coolant leak. They gave me the best deals possible and was able to get me and my truck back on the road in one day. Thanks so much guys! =)<//Review>

< Review>
Recently, we found ourselves stranded an hour west of Fresno, on the I-5. After a call to AAA we were referred to Complete Car Care. To make a long story short, My wife called on a Monday just as the shop was closing and Billy came and picked us up. The tow-truck could only carry four of us and there were six there. This incredible act of selflessness literally saved us hours of time and enabled my wife to be able to make her business trip the following day, which in turn saved them time and money.

Once in Fresno, Billy quickly put the car on a hoist and diagnosed the problem which enabled us to rent a car to get home (Fountain Valley) that same night.

Fortunately the problem was relatively minor, and the car was repaired in a few days. The next weekend, we drove up to pick up our car and once again, Billy opened the shop up (on their day closed) and helped up check out and be on our way.

The work done at this shop was first rate and Billy went above and beyond what anyone would even dare to expect. I cannot recommend them highly enough! Thank you!<//Review>

I tried this shop for the first time recently and the outlook is good. Their customer service takes a backseat to no one and I got same day service, which I wasn't expecting. You won't be making a mistake entrusting your car to these pros. Tip: Don't wash your car before taking it in, because a complimentary car wash is included in the service.

I"ve just started with Billy in the front office and he is so efficient and communicates with me on a regular basis.  He understands that parts "get delayed" even though when ordering it states two days.  This business is a winner in my eyes!  They haven't even started the work on the repairs but if the other staff is as superior as Billy I won't take my car anyway else!<//text>

Very satisfied customer. I've been to complete car care twice in the last 6 months and I'll never go anywhere else. They saved me thousands in auto repairs by quickly and accurately diagnosing a problem with my engine that was covered by an extended warranty through the manufacturer, and repaired at no cost to me. As a business owner I understand the value of honesty, it's priceless, and at the cost of a very significant repair job, Warren and company at Complete Car Care charged me a minimal diagnostic fee and saved me a ton. Thanks for your honesty which is rare these days. I highly recommend this place of course.< /review>

Didnt end up working as it was more in depth then that so I took it in. They knew exactly what it was got it done the same day, got a great deal with a discount for paying cash! I would highly, highly recommend them for any car care issues. Billy is the man!!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

And this business believes in providing honest work for an honest price. You're only charged for actual parts and labor necessary for the repair, unlike some facilities that may charge for more than what's required. If you're searching for a quality performance center, this is your place! Thanks guys.<//text>< pics>

I've been recommending this place for years. Very efficient, knowledgeable staff who make you feel welcomed and not a burden like a lot of shops. Replaced my catalytic converter for about 1/3 of what the dealer wanted. Also brought my parents car in after the dealer told them they needed several thousand dollars worth of engine work. They ended up finding out here it was misdiagnosed & it only needed about a $300 fix.</review>

<Text>These guys are great.  Fast, Quality and Friendly service.  They take the time and patience to explain things and never pressure you into unnecessary or expensive repairs.  I’ve been a customer for years, so glad I found a complete shop I can trust for all of our vehicles.  Not to mention the great sense of humor and upbeat demeanor that Billy always has.

12/2/2020 UPDATE:  Took our Suburban in for regular service and a check engine light.  The check engine light issue turned out to be a throttle body repair that was going to cost upwards of $900.  I was ready to pay for it and prior to the completion of the work Complete Car Care called me an advised me of the Valley CAN program that could help offset some of that cost.  It was a quick and simple phone call and it save me over $800 off that repair bill as the program paid these guy via voucher for that amount and I paid the balance.  CCC could have easily just let me pay the full bill, but they took the time to help me out and were also knowledgeable about the program.  Great customer service!!!<//Text>< Pics>

They've gone above and beyond for me and was very reasonable with the prices, and my car can be a pain to work on sometimes.  The staff there is knowledgeable, very kind, professional, and upfront with everything.  I also like how they take pictures of what is wrong with your vehicle and email it to you so you can see exactly what they are replacing.

James Fontes, Service is outstanding. When I had an emergence, they were able to get me in and fix the problem. When I need regular service, they inform me by email and usually I get an appointment with a couple of days. They are all very friendly. I recommend them to everyone who asks for car service.< /Text>

<Review>Trust is the #1 most important thing for me when choosing a mechanic. These guys quickly earned my trust 5 years ago and have made it stronger each time I've come back. I passionately recommend them to friends, and to you.

Why do I trust them? I could write an essay on it -- here is a story from my latest visit:

My car had a weird issue and I brought it in to be checked out. While I'm leaving Billy tells me to be careful getting my oil changed as they might try to do a bunch of repairs I don't need. I thank him for this advice and then later realize -- he just did a complete inspection of my car and came back with the diagnosis nothing was wrong with it and the only problems I had were needing an oil change and new wiper blades -- two things I was already aware of. He was warning me to watch out for people like he just proved (yet again) that he isn't.

I already knew that of course, which is why I didn't need any estimates beforehand or even to accompany the tow truck drive to the shop. That's a special thing with a mechanic. If I ever leave Fresno, this shop will be one of the things I miss the most.< /Review>< pictures>

Very friendly people! Informative, detailed, and also genuinely care about giving you great service! Would definitely recommend to people.
They also were able to fix my spoiler light which was so helpful because it would’ve cost way more getting it fixed at the dealer, so thank you guys!!<//text>

<Review>Went in to repair my passenger side headlight and was bot disappointed. Billy spent about 45 minutes trying to help solve the problem troubleshooting the fuses and relays. No charge by the way. Billy's tech guy, Mike showed up and an hour later, PROBLEM SOLVED. Customer Service here was outstanding and I highly recommend Complete Auto Care. Thanks Again Billy.</Review>< Name>

They are very good at explaining what they found and what it will cost to fix it.

To save time he ordered in a replacement transmission in case that was our only option.  Pulling and inspecting the trans they discovered a hidden exterior linkage rod was the problem.

<Review>This was my first time that I took my SUV to Complete Car Care. Their service is #1. I finally found a repair shop that I trust and will be taking my    SUV there from now on. I have a 2013 Ford Escape that needed a new water pump. While it was there, they inspected it and found a leak on the transmission seal. If they had not found the leak, I could have burned up my transmission. It was already two Quarts low. Thanks for a detailed inspection and service of my SUV.<//Review><userid>100464803517630206590< /userid>< Gmap_id>

This is the most honest automotive place that I have ever been to!! They don't try to sell you extras that you don't need. I have been a repeat customer for the past 3 years. They always fix my car correctly the first time and at a reasonable cost. If friends ask me for referrals,  I always recommend Complete Auto. See Billy, he will always help you out!!<//Text>

I have been going to the shop for a couple years now.  having Smog and other work done on my vehicle, the staff there are professional honest and knowledgeable and they go above and beyond to help you as a customer. when it comes to repairing your vehicle particularly the shop manager Billy and the owner Warren. I happen to be in the shop one morning when a police officer walked in and explained that he just stop by to say hi to the shop owner Warren. he wasn't sure whether he would remember him . Warren the shop owner was so careful about the kids in the neighborhood including him. that it made a huge impact on his life. And I must say as a customer he has done the same for me.< /Text>

Warren is a very conscientious owner.  He tries everyday to meet or exceed customer expectations. He has invested in state of the art technologies to accurately and quickly diagnose vehicles.  This has earned him the reputation of "The Guy" when you have difficult to diagnose vehicle problems.  The advantage to his customers is vehicles are repaired more quickly and accurately the first time. Instead of the usual "throwing parts at the problem" Warren tries to only change the defective part. In addition to repairs, they also do excellent service with good brand name car care products.<//Text>

< review>
What I love about CCC is they're never "remove and replace" mechanics who keep trying until they THINK they've found the problem. It's all about diagnostics and knowing what the problem is before they fix it. They save you time, stress and money by fixing it right the first time.<//review>

I would highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for a shop that will take a little time to give you the explanation of whatever problem you may be having with your vehicle. Warren and Billy were very helpful and didn't mind sharing their knowledge. Will definitely be calling them again when mechanical problems arise. A very honest and reliable shop.< /Text>

I really appreciate the personalized service from Complete Car Care. They shop for the best price on parts to drive down the costs of repair.  They work hard to correctly diagnose problems to avoid unnecessary repairs.  I highly recommend them for your patronage.<//Text>

<review>A very knowledgeable, honest and friendly shop. I brought my car in for a smog check and it failed. Warren was certain it was a failing catalytic converter so I had them replace it. Sure enough, the car passed smog after that. And since the process took less time than quoted, they deducted that from my bill. I'm very happy with my experience here.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1528831427810, 'text': "Hey Craig!!! Thanks so much my friend!!!

They gave my Honda CRV the 100K checkup. Awesome!  Much less than Honda and they did more. Billy was great to work with, so I returned to have the suspension checked on my Motorhome. They found that I had the wrong shocks (put on in Arizona). Complete Car Care is now my go to shop in Fresno!</Text>

After going to 2 other auto shop places I was told I should come here for my check engine problem and I'm glad I did.
After looking at my car they told me I had a pzev vehicle and that my problem could be under warranty if I took it to the dealer
They even did some research and called the dealer themselves to find out.
They could have fixed the problem and charged me several hundred dollars but instead showed me a cheaper alternative. That alone will make me go to them first for any other problem with my vehicle in the future :)< /Text>

Hands down the best experience I have ever had with a mechanic, namely as a female, typically easy prey for easy money! Warren & Billy obviously run their business as Christ led businessmen with great attention to customer service, education, and integrity. They were interested & attentive from the get-go, explained everything to where I could understand it, were respectful to my budget ($150.00 cheaper than competitor), AND added a few bells & whistles that made my day-to-day much easier and renewed my appreciation for my "hoopty".They  are excellent stewards of such a service industry; blessing others because they have been blessed. I am a new fan and a forever customer now; simply will not take my vehicle anywhere else from this point forward:)<//Text>

This Shop is not huge - however the services
were great. 1. They took me home so I didn’t wait in lobby. 2 The owner drove me home in my car so he could evalution it’s performance‼️
3 **they sent pictures of my cars, via email.
I saw pics of repairs that needed to be done.
At the bottom of each page, explainging. How the repair would benefit the car . I’ll definately  return🤧< /review>

<review>Brought my jeep in for smog and oil change. After the scheduled work was done they did a courtesy vehicle inspection. Am I glad they did, I have been taking the vehicle to the quick lub places but they never perform preventive maintenance.  Warren found some things that needed attention now and things that we can schedule later.  By IDing these problems, I avoided costly bills later this summer.  Thanks Warren.< /review>< userid>

I brought my Toyota Avalon in to have all four brakes worked on.  I was told that there was still some brake pad left so my rotors were good. I indicated that I would like the rotors turned if needed, and the manager said he would look at them. When we picked the car up, the brakes squealed and shimmied each time we applied them.  I called and asked the manager if the rotors had been turned and he said no they hadn't. He went on to infer that the problem was my fault, maybe I had overheated them, or that it shimmied before we brought the car in, ect....he did say he could look at it FOUR days later, but if he turns the rotors and its below that number, he will not let the car leave without me buying new rotors.

I felt threatened and did not want to risk more cost or damage to my car, so I didn't bring it in.

What I did learn was, on all Toyota cars, the rotors are supposed to be turned everytime the pads are replaced.  I also learned that the number is stamped on the rotor and that they can turn it just before they hit that number, they know ahead of time how much they can take off and can adjust to that.

I paid full price of 400.00 for a brake job that reminds me each time I drive of how poorly it was done and of the poor customer service that I received.<//text>

<review>took my dog here a few days ago for the first time and had a good experience. My dogs hair was tangled and very matted and they fixed that problem like magic. They did a very great job.
Plus the employees there are really nice. :)</review><Gmap_id>0x80c34d732e77f7f3:0xe327ca771a9c023<//Gmap_id><resp>None<//resp>< pics>

Took 2 weeks for them to answer for an appt, they only take cash, which would all be fine IF the girl at the counter hadn’t been so incredibly rude.
When I dropped my poodle off I said I didn’t want to take him home with loose hairs cause he gets itchy and didn’t want to have to bathe him after taken him to be groomed. She said they would blow him off and that would take care of that. Prior to picking him up my husband called and asked if he’d been bathed after his hair cut and if not,could he? they answered “all dogs get bathed” so we get there, my dog shakes and tufts of hair go flying, my black shirt and I are covered in prickly fuzz, the girl calls my husband a liar about the phone call asking if he’d been bathed, asks him to show her a recording of the conversation, tells us that they “don’t have time to bathe all the dogs twice” and said “he doesn’t have any loose hair anyway sooo...”
He pays her the $46 and says we won’t be coming back and she answers “That’s fine.” shrugs her shoulders and rolls her eyes.
I took my poodle home to bathe him AND fix his ears before the other dogs made fun of him because I realized what a creative job they’d done with the scissors 👌🏻<//Text>

Wendy and Natalie, co owners/groomers we're so fantastic. They were kind and helpful even though our little dog was badly in need of grooming. They did a fantastic job for a very reasonable fee. Thanks Holiday Pet Grooming...we will be back.< /review>

I've been a customer to holiday pet grooming over year. Never had it issue until today. I did walk in to see if they can see me today. The 2 older ladies said we are all booked up for today. I told them that I been Calling for about 2 to 3 weeks no one  answers the phone just rings then the answer machine I left a couple messages. And I told the women that nobody has called me back . she  stated it when we are booked we do not answer the phone or call anybody back that left messages. I told them that's insane especially since you are a business. The lady said I can make you an appointment for Monday I said OK I'll take it. I did say if I find somebody today then I Proability wouldn't be here Monday but I'll still take it for Monday. So she said can you give me a courtesy call to let me know that you do not need your appointment if so. I do not recommend this business so unprofessional on many different levels and no customer service at all.. I guess this is the way they treat customers that's been paying their employees. Over a year customer unbelievable.<//Text>

<Text>I've taken all my 4 dogs to this place since......wow! A good while already. The young lady is very professional and I truly recommend this place if your pet is a very nervous little one. Cutting my dogs nails have never been a problem here, I've even taken one of my dogs before to petsmart and got denied due to his aggressiveness. (Old age) And she handles him perfectly. 👌🏻< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

So I took my Maltipoo Chloe to a new groomer and this is how I pick her up, never has she ever been cut before. Their excuse was sure moves too much, them when they were getting her out from kennel they drop her and she hits her head on counter. That excuse was sure is excited to see you and she jumped out of my hands.😡😡<//Text>

<username>Lyn Holman< /username><Text>Have an older dog and have been taking him here for years. I don't know if owner's changed or what - but WORST service ever.  Always a different price and the last time I took my dog in,  he "cowarded" from their touch when I picked him up. Appeared scared of them which is totally unlike him. I felt my dog had been abused. Will NEVER use them again!< /Text>< response>

<Review>I've been bringing my pets here before they changed location but I am officially done with their uneven cuts. I paid $60 for a sloppy trim on my cat and she had a cut on her tummy. Completely uneven and if you don't tell them to trim your pets nails, they won't do it. Look for another place.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<username>Joanna Jimenez<//username><text>From the reviews I decided to take my dog here. I have a Bichon Frise 8 month old female puppy. I expected more from Holiday Grooming. I was disappointed & sad for my puppy. She didn't smell good, her nails were left super long, & they completely shaved her with her hair being left uneven & they cut her toward her back legs & private part.... With no fluff to her fur what so ever.... I paid the $46 they charged me but I'm still so sad this wasy first experience taking her to a groomer... Now it worry me to ever take her to another groomer again. The reviews say they are good but they weren't good with me & my doggy... I wish this never happened, my dogs skin is still irritated from them shaving her... So sad. Hopefully your experience is different but that was my experience at Holiday Grooming in Rialto CA  ;( :( :(</text><GmapID>0x80c34d732e77f7f3:0xe327ca771a9c023</GmapID>< response>

<Review>Free parking and spacious, however the coastline is rocky and finding a sandy stretch of beach that isn't crowded can be hard. Lots of fishing spots if you can avoid the kelp. Plenty of mussels and tide pools. There are tons of birds and I even saw seals hanging out. It's a beautiful piece of coast with a trail on a bluff above. Good for tide pool exploring and looking for starfish, Wakame, Nori, Konbu, and Sea Urchins.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Nice long beach with many rocks made the walking more interesting. Groups of pelicans and sea birds, as well as the seals. But a little bit stinky smell. Parking here at weekend is difficult，you may park along the road. Besides, the road to the beach is steep. Except chilly wind and cold water, everything is perfect. Good place for the family here<//text>

<text>About an hour drive from the Bay Area ! One of the many beautiful California beaches !! Right on US-1. The little town of pescadero is totally worth a visit ! Very laid back and your typical beach town !! If you are caught up in the work cycle of the Bay Area this beach is a nice relief !!</text><GmapID>0x808f06e8adaef087:0x7a60d7fa0fcdacc2< /GmapID>< rating>

This is one of my favorite beaches to visit the view is awesome and the drive to it from the valley is awesome. Super winding roads. Usually not too many people, also usually high winds probably not a great place to fly drones. Make sure you bring food and drinks as there are not many places to stop out here.<//review>

This beautiful beach would take your breath away. Loved it!! There's so much peace and serenity in this place, perfect for jogging, yoga or just sitting by the rocks and enjoy the view. It gets pretty chilly so I would recommend I light jacket.<//review>

<review>The beach view is so fabulous and the sound of the ocean makes you feel amazing. You can find different spots with different views. Easy to find parking and nice place for picnic. Children would enjoy playing with the sand and water.<//review>< UserId.>

We came here couple of times because the different vista points on different levels we could not cover at first time. This was one of the places which really led us to wake up on Saturday early mornings. There is a widespread marshland too, which itself can take a day if you want to be amazed. I am a fond of all inland water bodies which you will find a lot here. Requesting not to skip the walk in the marshes, but if you are already in a tight plan, an hour should be good to chill out in the beach here and take photos.< /review>

Beautiful views along the coast and chill spot to sit and picnic. This was a quick stop to eat our dinner from Mercado & Taqueria De Amigos which was just up the road. Amazing food & service! After we ate dinner, we took a walk down to the shore which was easily accessible with a short walk and a small set of stairs.</Text>

<text>Beautiful beach right off Highway 1. It's worth checking out the tide pools and watching the sunset reflect over them. The Pigeon Point Light House is 8 minutes south of this place. So if you are on your way down to there, I highly suggest pulling off here too.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Was on a drive with my mom down hwy 1. There are so many beaches along the way from Pacific toward Santa Cruz.

This was one of our stops

It is a nice beach. Some sandy areas with rocky areas. I do not remember if this particular one was a paid state beach or not.

There are walking trails...high Crest upon rocks...beautiful waves and flowers.

It would be a nice picnic area.

If your driving along the hwy. This is a great stop.</review>< Pictures>

We randomly picked a beach south of Half Moon Bay to stop at and I'm so glad it was this one. It's huge, broad, flat and gorgeous with tons of room to play and picnic and soak in the salty air. My favorite thing, though, were the tidepools, which were alive with all kinds of ocean creatures. We saw more sea anemones than I've ever seen before, sea stars of many colors, dungeness crab, hermit crabs and just off shore a colony of harbor seals. There's also a lovely marsh across the road filled with birds, including an egret rookery. The one downside is you do have to walk a bit from the parking lot to get to the beach (they've protected an area along the side of Highway One so it's safe for pedestrians) but it could be problematic if you have mobility issues. But it was absolutely spectacular!<//Text>

Pescadero is a hidden gem along Highway 1 between Davenport and Half-moon Bay. The beach has beautiful rolling waves for the kids to play in, hiking trails that follow Pescadero creek back a ways, and shallow areas where the creek meets the ocean for alleges to explore. Parking is usually pretty good, and the beach is large enough to never be super crowded.</Review>

drive to the beach is scenic. loved a few spots at the beach where sea plants were growing. There is a nearby bakery (arcangeli), which offers good sandwiches and bread. so, a wholesome short trip</Text>

<review>Lovely beach. We walked down the beach a little way to get away from the people. We enjoyed taking pics, feeling the sand & water between our toes, seeing the rocks, watching the waves & wildlife, which included many crabs, a hermit crab, fish, sea gulls & black pelicans. We stayed & watched the sunset, which was fun & much better then watching it from in town!< /review>< Rate>

<Review>Beautiful State Beach along the California coast. I stopped here to view the waves crashing up against the rocks, and it was quite a sight. The parking area for the part of the beach I went to was a little rough, but I managed fine. It's a beautiful spot, and I wouldn't hesitate to visit again.<//Review>< Pictures>

The beach has a kilometer-long coastline with sandy coves, rocky cliffs, natural pools, fishing spots and picnic facilities.

Pescadero State Beach has two distinct beach areas that are divided by the Pescadero stream.
The northern beach is wider and sandy and the southern one is rockier.
The beach to the north eventually connects to Pomponio State Beach and San Gregorio State Beach, depending on the tide level. This park is also home to a natural wetland area.

The nature reserve is a haven for steelhead, blue heron, kite, deer, raccoon, fox, skunk, barn swallow and weasel. A common bird on the rocky coast of northern California that can also be seen here is the black oystercatcher.

The coastline in the parking areas in the center and south is protected from sea waves by offshore rocks with numerous natural pools and open sea areas. This habitat is often occupied by the Steller sea lion and the seal. These pinnipeds alternately exhale, pulling them to the rocks off the coast and returning to the water to hunt nearby.

(Original)
Pescadero State Beach fica ao longo da State Route 1, localizada a 14,5 milhas ao sul de Half Moon Bay e 1,5 milhas a oeste da cidade de Pescadero no condado de San Mateo, Califórnia.

A praia tem uma costa com quilômetros de extensão com enseadas de areia, penhascos rochosos, piscinas naturais, pontos de pesca e instalações para piquenique.

Pescadero State Beach tem duas áreas de praia distintas que são divididas pelo riacho Pescadero.
A praia do norte é mais larga e arenosa e a do sul é mais rochosa.
A praia ao norte eventualmente se conecta a Pomponio State Beach e San Gregorio State Beach, dependendo do nível da maré.  Este parque também abriga uma área natural de pântano.

A reserva natural é um refúgio para truta prateada, garça azul, pipa, veado, guaxinim, raposa, gambá, andorinha de celeiro e doninha. Uma ave comum na costa rochosa do norte da Califórnia que também pode ser vista aqui é o ostraceiro negro.

A linha costeira nas áreas de estacionamento do centro e sul é protegida das ondas do mar por rochas offshore com numerosas piscinas naturais e áreas de mar aberto.  Este habitat é frequentemente ocupado pelo leão-marinho Steller e pela foca.  Esses pinípedes se exalam alternadamente, puxando-os para as rochas ao largo da costa e voltando para a água para caçar nas proximidades.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZljgqrsdQj4wkiO8W53t2h4vGqloQ_SuDyW3x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvHXMeb02CGDcYUD2twEjhkfgwWddrY_olaRxH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXAJiRkUm5cUxswwBxCQCuZl8jZJRuo8b6MNmv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0ZOLh_lWA0J7tWd8Rw1LMteaZAgFLyJiQsViT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqCcbmg-3A0VU_KFOxbRzrj7caFyAPBvcJXK3z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi9OPyWHHdst7ijsX_MXXSoifVG5gwfjQZqqnA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1nwWR-e3oq8AUytyRLDFw9LGsYVRWZskGmao1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEy101olODBf__XzKMQga_UEWvEZuGHM955M9L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-xJK0RQP7N5kuuAAe4CkFgV0IuxUgbVHd0QIo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6fjzh2ZAp9L7k11E6mKZ0QNmYHM52zHOoHS-U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPS3186wU91_5we9VzFfySfslGwCF52oTsS2o7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkHaEjdmEL8VAggL_vIShlK6sY5qBqIcM8U8YK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_bw8XrhTb6sE_dzT98oykDhtHWSn-6X3UCHeI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP006ixAVYtaZdJ6jfEivgK4cclqiUfpW8omnW4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6JCeSr5QPD49HdUrhFqKv364Ppn5T4YSggnuu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTCZuEndKMaaPIcnPxIe4tG6peXHYcQXdKrW0Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYfkP4UJFBw1FWEo2-SSFk2RW9Lt1xEvle225Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-1qiLNXUwWlBcCOmKZXrSiq8D1_fGx7HNDnDg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMy0-F4XD2mZodB0YE-hohNKAjLIdGmwO89pnx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBN5rALMzxUANy_evySomcnCsI_nuSEdQViv9G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkOqjEPK32LEo_hXgXQQMObTijEednNAbPLZ24=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuQ2vEmQuWCO4Z0c-QVAmYNBctelQewhwr3z4O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk6HIlSRcq-uSG5M2PZTYqZ1iDGk4Kq3ZOTytD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFRcSrNhPEVDdKQc91ztiyiFoU_KzZOFIGnWwo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The suburbs of Pescadero seduced travelers with wildflowers of immense color; Where the golden blaze like the sun, where the white like clouds, where the heart purple dreaming ... Far away is the ancient lighthouse is still horrible, despite the rain and sunshine time print constant to the tower. Sometimes the birds singing in harmony with the sound of the sea waves, creating a melodious music that captivated people, in the warm sunshine of the morning ... A beautiful new day begins!

(Original)
Vùng ngoại ô Pescadero quyến rũ lữ khách bằng những cánh đồng hoa dại mênh mông đủ sắc màu; nơi thì vàng rực như nắng, nơi thì trắng tựa như mây, nơi thì tim tím mộng mơ...Xa xa là ngọn hải đăng cổ xưa vẫn sừng sững bất chấp mưa nắng & vết thời gian in hằng lên tháp. Thỉnh thoảng vẳng vẳng đâu đây tiếng chim hót hoà quyện với tiếng sóng biển rì rào, tạo nên một bản nhạc du dương làm say đắm lòng người, trong tia nắng ấm áp của ban mai...Một ngày mới tươi đẹp bắt đầu!< /Review>

<text>Thank you Simon, Sara, and Steve for the genuine hospitality and AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE provided last Saturday when we financed a vehicle with them. Till this day (4-days later) Simon and Sara are still in contact with me answering a few questions I had. Because we have bad credit, we didn’t really know what kind of car we would be approved for. But they worked their magic and were able to get us in 2018 standard SUV -THANK YOU JESUS🙌🏻🙌🏻👆🏻👆🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻. I will be taking the car back early next week just for their mechanic to look over it one last time. Thank you again Untied Motors folks for all that you do😊😊😊 I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this dealer to anyone looking to purchase/lease a car.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Claims to be a veteran owned and operated business but when it comes to honesty and integrity they are definitely lacking in that department, they do nothing but give you the run around.

The guy/gal answering phones is nonexistent and they don't even have a real voicemail, just an automated "you've reached (insert phone number) please leave a message after the beep"

The guy/gal answering their Facebook is completely unhelpful.

Go to a real dealership that's run by professionals and not these losers.< /Text>

As a newly married couple we had been going around different dealerships trying to find out first car together but it wasn’t a easy process especially with our credit score and budget limitations. However we were so lucky and completely won over by one of their financial managers, Sara Mojarad Nabas. She was very patient with us, kind, answered all our questions, and gave us a perfect deal on a car we didn’t even think was within our budget. Their wasn’t any pressure on us which was often the experience we felt when dealing with previous dealership we had gone to. Would definitely recommend this place to all my fiends and family and to anyone trying to get a great deal on a good car. The car was awesome and the overall buying experience was just perfect.<//Review>

What can I say? Called and spoke with someone who told us to come in and look at what they had. My husband and I indeed did. Had a lot of cars to choose from but with not so good credit we were unsure what we could get. Needless to say we are very satisfied with the outcome. Sara worked her magic and we are now car owners of something newer and very low mileage. Thank you all for the great work.</review>

<Text>I found these guys on Facebook one night while I was searching for a car. Saw one i liked and reached out, I was contacted back in minutes. Set up an appointment for the next day and when I went in the customer service from Sara was immaculate. She went far and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and got the car I wanted at a reasonable price. Steve was amazing and genuine and treated me like family which is something I look for when doing any type of business, outstanding man. I will definitely be buying my second car here and refer them to everyone I know! Need a geat up to date reliable car? Go to United Motors!< /Text><date>1529620034434< /date><user>108990006403946112161<//user>< username>

If I could give zero stars, I would. This guy is extremely unhelpful, rude and did nothing but waste my time. Steer clear of this place at all costs, VERY UNTRUSTWORTHY!!!!!!!</review>

Good experience to begin with ended horrible.  Should be laws against companies like this .  Reel you in and approve you .... buy your car for half it’s worth .... make you sign agreements outside of your means.... and rush you out after you sign ... couldn’t even fill up the tank. ...
Go to a reputable dealership and if you can’t afford the down payment don’t get talked into the deferred down payment scams .... not worth it<//Text>

Bought a Ford Fusion for my wife and traded in her old car, very happy happy with the price and service. Very smooth and no pressure at all and anyone looking for a reliable used car at United Motors in Sacramento just ask for Steve and also have a talk with Sara. Thank You!</Review>

*Laid back, no pressure environment*

United Motors LLC has truly been a blessing in disguise! They totally exceeded my expectations!

Steve Struiksma and Sara Mojarad took the time to give me all of my options. When others said no, United Motors came through in my time of need. I ended up getting a brand new car that I LOVE and can afford. They even took the time to make sure I knew how everything worked, the condition of the vehicle, etc. I highly recommend United Motors! It was worth the drive and effort to speak with them. This dealership was top notch! Steve and Sara went above and beyond to make sure I purchased the car I was most comfortable with. They gave me suggestions and advice, but was in no way pushy what-so-ever. After I decided on a car, the process was absolutely painless.

So quick and professional. I felt like family by the end of the whole process! I highly recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a new or used vehicle, ESPECIALLY if you are active duty or reserves in the US Military.<//review>

<Review>United Motors has a very good business model. They give back to the people who give their life for the country. The vehicles they sell are in great shape and they back it up with by showing a certification from the actual car manufacturer dealer that the vehicle is in great condition.

Sara and Steve were able to help me  with a purchase of a 2015 Kia Sedona knowing my financial situation. Kudos to them and United Motors, LLC!</Review><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Called a week in advance to schedule an inspection for my Wrangler Jk, had it locked on for days and even called a day before to make sure my appointment was still good. I also called ahead to make sure I could drop it off the night prior to the inspection. When I arrive there they had no record of my scheduling and then proceeded to say they were over booked. I drove an hour and a half with a mean death wobble just to be turned away.<//Text>< pics>

Been going here for the Last Year to have work done to my truck (Alignment, Frame Clearance, New Wheels, Lift, and General Tire Rotation/Balance). The Service Department here does take a long time to get work done mainly because of how busy they are but EVERY time I have gotten my truck worked on they have done an amazing job. Would recommend this shop for anyone who has had issues with other shops damaging there truck like I have personally had in the past. Great Shop, Great Prices, and an amazing Service Department I can Trust with my Tacoma.< /text>

I’m disappointed by a business talked about so highly of, I came in to get a rebuild on my Ford F-350 d60 front axle, inner outter wheel bearings, ball joints, axle seals, and a pair of premium hubs, I was quoted and left a deposit, after almost 3 weeks of no contact about my parts I decided to call in and was told that I would have to wait another week, two weeks later I call them again and finally the week after I call the store they were able to get me in. The truck is all done so I thought and I ask for my used parts back, the next day I’m going the box I got back from the shop and missing is my used front wheel bearings!!!!! So I call in to see if maybe they forgot to put them in the box, it happens I get it, no they weren’t put on the truck to begin with!!!!!! Nor were the premium locking hubs that I paid for on my truck!!!! I would have rather waited a second day for them to do the job right and complete!!!! I will never buy from or recommend to anyone. Have a nice day<//text>

I have a 1999 4Runner that needed new struts and shocks. I requested an overall inspection at 4WP and no problems were noted by the service other than the struts and shocks. 4 Wheel Parts has competitive prices for parts and service. However, when they were finished installing the struts and shocks, they then noted that the rear track bar bushings were worn out. They tried to sell me a new track bar for about $300, when only the bushings were bad, which are around $20, after I asked about this. I asked them to order the new bushings and I brought it back a second time to have those replaced. At that time, I noticed that a lot of grease had escaped from the front axle CV boots. They then told me that these needed to be replaced after I brought it to their attention. It seems that I am doing a better job noticing problems with my 4Runner than the professionals at 4WP. Their initial inspection should have caught these other problems so that I would not have to drag this process out and notice them on my own to do one repair at a time. Overall: not impressed.</text>

Bad service and staff seems to care less about the customers. Feels like they are just dreaming of the next off-road trip and hate customers. Bolt on lift took over 10 hours. 5 hours just to do alignment. Also the hours are incorrect online. They say they are open from 9-6 but when you arrive the hours are actually 8-7. Hahah what a well ran business. May have another shop check lift to be sure correct as the brainpower here seems low. Only come here if you enjoy bad service and long waits.< /review>

This 4wheelparts in Temecula need better training on their staff members I bought a Houver  for my Jeep and it wouldn't fit in my hood I call and call to let them know and they're like its the right part well I got frustrated and took the part and show them and he still told me its the right part well I knew it wasn't the right part sooo I decided to go to the Riverside store and I got the professional help that I need it and yes the Temecula store sold me the wrong part like I said I wouldn't recommend this store because all they want it's to get the left behind merchandise out no matter what.

<review>I dropped my husbands truck off this morning and needed to hurry out the door to work.  They completed all the work before I was off and briefed both my husband and I on the repairs made and the charges.  David was very helpful and polite.

<Text>Great experience with 4 Wheel Parts of Temecula. They recently installed King suspension front and rear on my 16 Tacoma and did an excellent job. Everyone was friendly and eager to help. Tito did a great job of initially talking to me over the phone. I will definitely be purchasing more products from them.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

They could not do a leveling kit and alignment  on my 2006 Ford F2 50 they over tighten the ball joints beyond factory specs the truck couldn’t drive properly I took it back and asked them to fix the situation and at the end of the day they still hadn’t fixed it I had to take it to precision alignment to get it properly fixed it’s 2019 I can’t believe these guys cannot do the job on that 06 Ford F2 50 that should be easy as pie .  My first appointment they charge me for an alignment but sent me home without doing it then I came back to have the rear leaf springs put in and discovered they charge me for an alignment I brought it to their attention and they called me a liar suggesting that I was trying to pull a fast one on him . This place lacks in customer service And mechanical no how. I cannot in good conscious suggest this place to anyone</text>

If you are only after looks this is a descent place to go. But if you’re actually going to 4x4 I don’t recommend  this place. They either don’t know or don’t care what actually works in the dirt. They are all about the almighty dollar and that’s it. And you can get most of the same parts they sell elsewhere cheaper because they mark everything up a lot.< /text>

Tommy was the worst clerk I went in to buy extra accessories option that Toyota could sell or install. I have a 2019 Toyota Tacoma TRD PRO. I WHEN IN HE ACTED LIKE I HAD NO MONEY TO BUY,  I GUESS IT WAS A AMERICAN MADE TRUCK WITH JAPANESE PARTS. I WANTED TO BUY SOME ITEM FOR THE FRONT AND BACK AND ALL AROUND THE TRUCK ESPECIALLY ITEM THAT DID INTERRUPT THE SENDORS. HE DID NOT HAVE MIST OF THE PARTS. HE TOOK MY NUMBER AND INFORMATION OF ALL THE PARTS TO GIVE ME PARTS AND INSTALLATION COST. I WAITED I WAITED WEEKS WENT BY ,SO I STOP BY AGAIN ASK WHY HE HAS NOT CONTACTED ME. HE FORGOT ME. I WAS SPENDING A FEW THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. EVEN THAT EVEN IF I WAS SPENDING $1.00 HE WAS THE WORST.  WAKE UP 4X4 OWNERS.<//text>

Extremely over priced, they are just a middle man better off trying to order and install everything yourself! Salesman’s are just there for the money and don’t care about the customer.... no enthusiasm. 4 wheel parts is a huge company with a reputation but this location does not meet that reputation at all, never go here!< /text>

Store is pretty much bare bones as far as parts go. Total waste of time. If I wanted to order parts, I would do it from the comfort of my own home online and have it delivered to my house. This place is an over rated middle man. Save your time and order online. Don't waste your gas coming here unless you have a razr. They have lots of razr stuff. That's it. If you need parts for your truck, this isn't the place to go.< /Review>

Definitely had a great experience here. Before ever going into the store I was always treated with patients and courtesy on the phone. Made appointment for wheel and tire install, wasn't long before I was rolling out. Little mix up with the bill, called and they immediately handled it.<//Text>

Not open on Sunday.. called to see if they had a part in stock and was put on hold and they never got back to me. Called the next Saturday morning and was asked if they could call me back cause they were to busy with people in the store. I said ok and guess what? Never called me back. I just wanted to know if they had a shock in stock before i drove down there. I've tried 3 times now. Just going to order from Amazon now.</Text>

<review>Don’t waste your money on their “extended warranty”. They do not honor it and it’s a hassle to get your equipment repaired properly or at all. They would rather throw a band-aid on the problem than do the right thing. Very poor customer service.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Don't buy tires at this place, if you do don't get the inclusive tire warranty.  I spent a lot of money here with Tires, rims, shocks, leveling kit and added tire warranty for another 100 bucks. Now 28 k miles later tires are wore out at 2/32 tread and they will do nothing for the customer. NEVER buying tires or anything else at this 4 wheel parts store.

Hello all so here it is I ordered a super-chips programer from their website turns out it was back ordered with no indication that it was and still is and for the past 3 weeks. I've been told next week now for the last 3 weeks. It seems the store is getting tired of me calling they keep saying we will call you when its in but I think we all know how good they are at that. I've also emailed the customer service and amazing no response I think I will go back to ordering from summit same customer care but better prices.< /Text>

Got helped out by Ricky, and Johnathan than by the manager Tommy. Nothing but good people who knows their stuff and care about the community and their customers. They swapped my shocks out due to one blowing. No questions asked. Thanks guys! I'll always be coming back.<//Review>

Walked in to their store today waited my turn to be waited on was going to purchase $1000 worth of shocks for my truck! the sales associate interrupted us and said he had to help another customer that was walking through the door and made me wait 20 minutes and still didn't even come back to me so I left and didn't spend a dollar with them !  I just moved here I spend a lot of money on my vehicles I'm going to find somewhere else to do business !<//Review>

Their online shipping is also very confused as far as what they have or don't, they seem to keep shipping the wrong parts and communication with them has been neglected as well

I was in the market for replacing 4 BF Goodrich Tires. After much research I went with 4 Wheel Parts store in Temecula. I was first greeted on the phone by service manager Leon. He then proceeded to answer all my questions and direct me to the Temecula store. Leon and the awesome staff in Temecula were able to schedule us in that day on such short notice. That is when I meet Ryan Cary, the Sales Associate that then answered more of my questions and was really friendly. I asked for a couple other quotes on my truck and Ryan walked me through what I needed and gave me the most competitive price around. Thank you Ryan and the entire 4Wheel Parts staff for your excellent customer service and genuine honesty! I'll be back!</review>

< review>
I have spent over 26,000 with 4 weel parts and they have always waited till last second to work on my vehicle. I dropped it off with them and they had it for 3 weeks before they even started working on my vehicle after I spent 26,000. They made me wait so long and every time I have brought it back since then they have over charged me for more things and done minimal work always putting me off till the last second. They say they will be done in an hour and then I call an hour later and they say another hour then I call again and they say another hour when the truth is they haven't even started working on it yet. They complete minupulators. I thought they were great but now I wouldn't recomend them to anybody. They have tried upselling me on quotes over and over just to make thousands more in there pocket and thinking just because I have money they can take advantage of it. Go somewhere else as there customer service and work is not acceptable at any means.< /review>

Excellent service and very good food. I had a delicious salad with chicken added.  I also had a couple slices of marghuerita pizza which was great. We were a party of 3 children and 3 adults celebrating a birthday.<//text>

<Review>Nice Italian theme in the decor, which was well supported by the music and the rest of the atmosphere. My breakfast needs are pretty basic, so I can’t comment on the majority of the menu, but it seem unique and inventive, compared to standard breakfast menus. Service has been great so far!<//Review>< Date>

This restaurant is my preferred one. I visit plenty of restaurants but to this one I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very chummy and the cuisine they serve is so good. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice dinner here. I highly recommend this place.</review>

<text>Across the street from the convention center, so very easy walking distance. An upscale sit down restaurant so don’t expect to run over and have your dinner if you’re just skipping one panel.  Dinner and dessert were both good and they had no problems remembering or executing my customizations.<//text>< Pictures>

Nice traditional Chinese Restaurant housed in what looks to be a former Pizza Hut. Food was very good and so was the service. I was there for lunch with some friends and everyone enjoyed their food. I can't say anything bad. I wish I lived closer and I'll definitely be back!<//text>

<Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>103945314724723970477< /UserId.><review>Absolutely the worst service ever. McDonalds is a 5 star service compare to this one. After sitting for 30 min in an almost empty restaurant I had to go ask for waiter to come. 10 min later he showed up reluctantly took our order and asked if we wanted bread. Brought us oil and literally 10 min later bread. We been here 40 min to finally get bread. And just so you don’t think I’m picky here is the place right now

But in fairness once the food actually arrived it was really good

So the lesson is - if you are in a hurry this isn’t a place for you, but if you have a few hours to spare and you want good food - you found a perfect place<//review><Date>1556234941018<//Date>< Rating>

Great restaurant in San Jose. I just didn’t notice a salada wasn’t included in a fresh pasta. Other than that, it was amazing.< /review>

Located in the Weston hotel.
Waiter was helpful and gave good recommendations.  It helped make our visit to the area complete with a special meal.
The Grigliata di Pesce Misto (  grilled seafood medley) and Cappellacci di Zucca ( butternut squash pasta ravioli filled with squash and walnuts) were delicious. Flavorful and cooked perfectly meals.
We had an appetizer, a soup, two meals , a coffee , a tea and  shared a dessert for $110 + tip, Worth the price.</Text>

Italian food at this spot - very tasty. Super tasty. I had a brother come into town and he asked me to go back here. Prices are fair I would say.<//Text>

<Text>Okay food for such a pricey place. We came here for breakfast and had the eggs Benedict and bacon omelette, and while fairly good, neither was worth the price. The interior is nice, but there's not much of a view. The service was amicable and decently quick.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_klsXwxgBNCZpkAJ9wszl28xHCc5dhheyBU7l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJmaH99OPbEY0iMPp_72qHcTnFQ6I3HOuaXTjd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<Text>I preferred the dog pile over the burger. It's pricy and large so def split it. It had two patties on top of crispy fries or tater tots with their sauces. You can also ask to split your dog pile with half fries and half tots. Both are made well. They've been crisped up real nice which I always love.< /Text>< gmapID>

We were able to enjoy the Calabria menu which is being offered for a short time as part of o rotating regional selection. The rustic bread served with olive oil and vinegar was a great start. We both enjoyed our salads and our pasta courses. Staff was attentive and knowledgeable.< /Text>

Kontentsu is so good! Loved their tonkotsu ramen and the gyudon, a serving could probably be good for two with average appetite but if you have a voracious appetite then you can enjoy it all to yourself. lol!

Service is good and prompt. Will definitely go back!</Text>

Great Italian food and Amazing wine collection.
Ambiance is Nice.
The arugula salad was full of flavors.
I ate the Mushrooms Risotto and it's rare to find a place which does justice to flavors and textures of a well balanced Risotto.
I enjoyed dessert also. It was very yummy.
Overall I Like this Place.<//review>

<review>If I could rate this zero stars, I would have no problem doing so. I had such a terrible experience here and I will most definitely not be going back. I have a severe nut allergy and I did inform the waiter, he assured me that there were no nuts in what we were ordering. Others in my party ordered a meatball appetizer, which the waiter came back almost five minutes after we had it at our table to let us know that there were pistachios in the meatballs. I’m lucky I didn’t take a bite out of the dish. They also never refilled our waters when we were there, and it took forever for them to bring us the drinks at first. The food is extremely overpriced for the serving sizes they have and the service that comes with it. If you have any allergies or dietary restrictions, don’t even think about coming here. Everyone, save your money and go somewhere else. 0/10 would not recommend.</review>< username>

This is a phenomenal restaurant if you are looking for good Italian cuisine. The pricing is reasonable in comparison to other restaurants in the bay area. The atmosphere is very "high society" and the service is great. Perfect place for a dinner date or lunch with co-workers. Truly one of San Jose's hidden gems.<//text>

<review>Italian food and the atmosphere here is better than most. Service is always excellent even when they have a full house. Looking forward to coming back with my friends. Prices were average for the menu. Food and feeling reminds me of Kansas City.</review><Rating>5< /Rating>< time>

<Text>Location is right in Westin! Food is authentic and obviously  little on expensive side.

I won’t say it’s experience but still more on fine dining side. They keep changing menu and have specials. Quite a bit wine pairing options. There bread is good, I usually don’t eat that but wasn’t able to pass on this.

Decent vegetarian options and good part is there willingness to make it work and customize.< /Text><UserId.>107039472610097876200</UserId.><username>Rahul Sharma<//username>< rate>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I had a fish Stew with lots of shrimp, scallops, shell fish and something white. The soup was good but a bit too spicey. One friend ordered pizza, which was just okay and enough for two. The pasta dish was not bad. The chicken with spinach was good as well. The restaurant was a bit classy. The food was okay. The taste was normal. The waiter seemed a bit 'salty'.< /Text>< Pics>

I have been to Il Fornaio for Happy Hour and have always been impressed with the quality and service. The same holds true to weekend brunch. Wonderful menu choices. Excellent service. My son said it was the BEST eggs benedict he has had, and he loves to eat out. It was a lovely choice for a delicious brunch before walking to the children's performance of the Nutcracker in downtown San Jose.</text>

< Review>
When we with my wife stop by, we would like not see sour-faced waiter, when he heard, that we are here to spend some time with cup of coffee and would like to see desserts menu only.
And I would prefer to get a cheque after I ask for it, but not when we haven't finished yet.< /Review>

Food was good but not excellent. We had a private room and pre-selected menu. Ended up spending almost $120/pax. Service was friendly and attentive but the food could have been better for how much they charge. Convenient location and good for groups.</Text>

<review>I have been to this place twice and each time it has been a major disappointment.  I love the staff, the decor and service but the food is way over priced for mediocre taste.
I ordered a Ribeye Steak, which my butcher says is one of the best tasting meats and it was flavorless, and much to fatty.  I rather cook my own steak than have these "chefs" cook one for me.  Go for drinks but for meals keep walking!< /review><UserId.>109406392238412396548<//UserId.><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None</pics>< gmap_id>

I dined there two nights in a row, as my hotel was just across the street. The dining room is nice, not too loud, considering the amount of tables set up. Their wine selection was good, but a tad expensive for selections by the glass. I thought their spinach ravioli was the better of the two meals I had. The sauce on the ravioli was good enough to dip the bread in, after I polished off all the ravioli. The bread was warm and tasty, and came with oil and vinegar. The second night, I had their free range chicken, with a (slightly) spicy sauce. The chicken was cooked very well, and the spinach side was prepared perfectly. The potatoes that came with the dish were the only low point, as they were somewhat hard and dry. Service was attentive, but just a tiny bit on the slow side one evening. Still, the waiter was friendly. I watched him go over almost the entire menu with a table of four next to me, after they just couldn't decide what to order. He was patient, and professional.< /Text>

Downtown area so parking has to be managed.  The restaurant is in the hotel and the entrance is from inside the hotel also.  Service was great and personal, food was fresh and served very well.  Place can get loud if you have a large party.  Overall a little tight on the layout.  Very friendly and accommodating to kids.< /Review>

Very good service and helpful staff. 5 star for that. Food varies from average ( steak) to fantastic (ravioli). Sides are good to excellent, made from honest ingredients. Overall above average and more than meeting expectations.< /Text>

Very nice upscale dining. Good quality is outstanding. We also had some people in our party which had a meeting to get to. They told our server at the start of the meal, and they served them super quick getting them done with time to spare. Fantastic service!< /Text>

<Review>I have eaten here numerous times over the years and I have never had a bad meal. The attention to detail is very high for all the meal service times. Even when they are packed, you can expect timely delivery of your food and highly attentive service personnel. They are conveniently located across from the convention center if you happen to be attending an event there. There is also a large parking lot across the street (assuming it is not filled from the convention center patrons that is.</Review><user_id>100248684761841174095</user_id><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Good ambience, fantastic staff and finally a nice Risotto! I ate the Mushrooms Risotto and it's rare to find a place which does justice to flavors and textures of a well balanced Risotto. This place definitely delivered!</Review>

<time>1566792262342<//time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>I took a seven year break after a couple awful service experiences at the Walnut Creek location but thought, maybe this location and after all that time, things might be better. NOPE!

They were terribly short staffed and the food was not great. The burrata salad was bland and there was no offer of balsamic. The minestrone was good but super salty. My pasta was served sloppily in a bowl with splatter all over it.

It took 15 minutes for the server to even greet us. We were literally about to walk out. Our server barely checked on us after taking our order and i had to ask for refills for the table as none of the staff noticed our empty glasses that had been on the table for quite some time.

If only there was a way to tell if the local theaters and convention center would be busy this weekend? If only there was a way to know that there were lots of things happening downtown in SJ so they could call in extra help... If only...

This isn't Olive Garden. Our expectations were higher. That was the worst $80 I've spent in a while.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Wow!  They treat you so well!! Went here on our anniversary and the manager greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary. We even received complementary sparkling wine and dessert.  They made our time very special.  A special thank you to our server Tristen.  He made us feel so special and welcomed and answered all our questions and gave wonderful recommendations.  We will definitely be returning with friends!<//Review>

<date>1526381068529<//date><rating>1< /rating><text>Hostess probably worked at a fast food restaurant before coming here.  Booked a reservation for Mother’s Day, came 15 minutes, and was told table will be ready in 5 mins.  I then sat right outside with my family for 20-25 minutes, maybe 10 past my reservation time, and asked about my table.  Hostess looked behind her and said, oh, tell them to come in table is ready... she was previously standing there with 3 other coworkers just chatting.

When we walked up to the table, my chair was wet, so the same hostess said she would help clean it.  She grabbed a towel and just glide over the chair, leaving it still wet and actually sticky.  I walked back up to her to suggest a new chair or be moved to a different table.  She then came back over, grabbed our menus, and put it on a different table without any words said.

Besides the worst hostess in any restaurant I’ve been to, my entree came out room temperature warm.  Is this even expected?  Didn’t want to ruin Mother’s Day so I just kept quiet.  This will be the last time I go back and will make sure never to recommend this place.

Thanks for nothing.  Please give the hostess a warm warning to do a better job<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Text>This place sees a lot of traffic and it would be easy for the staff and kitchen to fall into a routine of turning tables and spinning plates. Cece isn’t doing that at all. We took a table in the bar tonight and — despite being slammed — Cece gave us personal recommendations and lit us up with a warm smile while everyone else was frantically running about. Best meal we had in San Jose this trip.<//Text>< Pictures>

My coworker's and I had lunch at Il Fornaio since we were at a Conference.  We all ordered salads. Nothing special about them and  my chicken was overcooked and dry. Service was just OK. I remember when this place was really great. A lot of competition in the area. I suggest management to review top to bottom and step it up. The bus boy, man, was great. Our server, not so much.< /Text>

My girlfriend and I went there for our 1 year anniversary because we wanted to splurge a little. Side note: And also because we're boycotting Olive Garden for supporting Trump's reelection.

First, the service was great. All of the servers were aware of our needs and were filling up our waters almost every time they walked by. Second, the dinner was absolutely DELICIOUS and SIMPLE.

My girlfriend got the gnocchi al pesto and the pesto, you can tell, is homemade and absolutely delicious with blasts of flavor. Plus the gnocchi was incredibly soft, it complemented everything so well. I received the penne with the vodka sauce without bacon because we're vegetarian and OH MY WORD, that pasta dish was made with so much jam packed flavor. The sauce was absolutely amazing. Overall these two dishes tasted incredibly authentic and the portions were absolutely perfect and worth the price.

The dessert was probably the biggest surprise of the night. We opted out for the almond chocolate cake and salted caramel gelato with raspberry sauce. WOW. That's all I have to say.

You can truly tell this restaurant cares about being authentic and utilizing fresh ingredients that have incredible flavor. Will definitely be coming back for another special occasion and I highly recommend supporting this local place if you live in the Downtown San Jose area. Thank you for having us and being LGBTQ+ friendly!</Review>

The food is absolutely phenomenal here! We just walked in on a whim and we were not disappointed. My husband got the short rib and I had the seabass and it was shine of the best seafood we've ever had. The atmosphere, the wine, the staff and the food is certainly worth checking out!</Text>

Only remarkable part of the meal was the pre dinner bread which was pretty good. The pizza I ordered was pretty boring and needed a better sauce with more garlic. I tried my friends pasta and the sauce for that was bad as well like a sugary tomato paste. For the price and reputation it was very underwhelming.</review>

Efficient and friendly service. I recommend ordering and sharing an appetizer, salad, and a main course. Salmon is farmed but good. Finish the meal with sorbet and grappa.< /Text>

I had a thin crust pizza called fradiavola which was sausage, mushrooms, peppers, onions covered with a spicy oil. Very delicious! Kind of spicy but I like my pizza like that.my daughter had the Conchigli al pollo. She liked it a lot. Juicy chicken with pasta, broccoli and garlic cloves.My sis had the Insalata Di pollo dal Girarrosto. Basically a very nice and fancy cob salad. I will say that they use some very nice pieces fresh bacon on the salad. My wife loved it!</Review>

Tucked away in the same building as the SanJose Hyatt, you will find an Italian menu, but over - priced, with decent portions. Personally, I think they're trying too hard. Their Caesar dressing was far too fishy and lemony, the risotto adequate, and the penne with vodka sauce was drowning with bacon. The bread was very tasty.</Text>

<Text>It's a quite fancy restaurant with good decor and ambience. The people who work there seemed to behave as if they know of such a situation. We went twice thIs particular week as it was close and for the guests. However, the experience during the two visits last week was less than satisfactory.

Perhaps, it was too busy. But, it was difficult to get attention. Upon getting the attention and asking for a few things, it took several minutes to respond making what were requested more or less meaningless for the meal.

One of the guest's meal was subpar where the parts of the spaghetti pasta were clumped and thus undercooked, causing some efforts to avoid those portions. In fact, my fish/salmon was undercooked in retrospect, which I thought at the time was intentional. Anyway, the guest was gracious enough to not cause issues with the pasta and thus found out only toward the end of the meal. We considered bringing this to the attendant but decided not to due to the earlier slow and somewhat ignorant responses and we didn't want to be late to the next event.

Lastly, about the food... It is okay but really it's missing something as the food tends to be blend and doesn't really bring out the exclamatory wows. I should have voiced objection when this was picked bringing up how I got sick (once each at the San Jose and Santa Clara restaurant) after eating at Il Fornaio previously. I am glad that I didn't get sick after eating the undercooked salmon.

Italian cuisine is one of my favorite. But, it's been less than average experience here at Il Fornaio unfortunately, especially when one considers the price...

I considered 1 star rating... The second star is for the decor and ambience...</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I like this restaurant. When I go there I usually sit at the bar but you can order off the full menu while you're there. The food is very tasty the drinks are good and it's a very pleasant atmosphere.</text>< userid>

<text>The appetizers were good as was the risotto. The salad needed some TLC, and the main and the cannelloni was an embarrassment. the potatoes that were served with both the sea bass and the salmon were so rubbery im sure they would bounce if they hit the floor. The fish was dry and the veggies bland. I would have been upset if I got this quality of good at a Denny's.  Maybe there having an off day but i won't be back to give them a send shot nor any of the members of the party I was with.</text>< pics>

Came here for my parents' 30th anniversary lunch. We decided to come to the lower-reviewed San Jose location because it is closer to us and to avoid the lunch rush in Santa Clara.

I have to say that the reviews are right; service was pretty underwhelming. Our server was pretty aloof, and I never caught his name. He seemed a little annoyed about our questions about the menu. He never checked in with us after the food arrived, and we spent about half of our eating time trying to locate him to get our glasses refilled and order a drink. We felt like we were interrupting him. What for the food was also pretty long, but that doesn't usually bother us. Has some nice date night ambience, but it was kind of spoiled by the service.

The food was solid. We have had Il Fornaio catering that has blown us away, and this didn't do that. With the exception of the bruschetta, which was excellent. Petto di Pollo a la Peperonccini - essentially a grilled chicken with a spicy sauce and a kind of boring salad. Ravioli - Good! The sauce was very fresh tasting with a bit of bit. Lasagña - good, but very rich. Very soft and sauce-like.

So... probably worth it to go to Santa Clara for the better service. Also, parking validation for Convention Center parking only, just fyi.</review>

<review>Might be good on a normal visit, but we went for Thanksgiving dinner and were mostly ignored by the staff, then served a few cold, rubbery slices of turkey, unseasoned green beans, and sweet potato slices so hard that I couldn't get my fork into them. The pumpkin pie was good, at least, but yeah, I won't be eating there again.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Pasta was pretty good; salad wasn't anything special but was fresh. Service was real slow, only had the one drink over 2+ hours.  Had to ask for water multiple times.  If you're on a tight schedule, this would be a bad choice.< /review>

< Review>
The Olive bread was very good.  After that everything went downhill.  The Caesar salad was not fresh and had some brown pieces in it.  The cheese was a very salty batch that they probably got a discount on.  The pizza I order was supposed to be a Margarita Pizza and it wasn't even close.  That is a pizza that is supposed to have the three colors of the Italian flag with fresh slices of tomato, mozzarella and fresh basil.  I got a cheese pizza with two little pieces of basil.  It was salty and hands down the worst pizza I have ever had.  The average Italian would think we are idiots for eating such low quality dishes at a sky high price.

I also tried other dishes from family with me.  The salmon was the cheap Costco farm salmon and was dry.  The scallops were over cooked. Ravioli was something bad.  The lamb shank had far too much salt on it and was the best dish at the table.

What a huge disappointment the restaurant was.  They need to fire the chef.  I give it two stars, because the olive bread was good.</Review>

This place has the rudest staff ive ever came across. I came in with my wife to pick up a to go order and when I first got here I went to the reception desk by the front door and I asked the lady with glasses kindly "where would I be able to pick up my order?" And she rudely answered "at the bar" while she waved her hand like I was some dog she was trying to shoo away. So then I get to the bar and I stood there for approximately 5-7 minutes before I took it upon myself to ask where I could pick up my order. The bartender was a older lady with short hair who had looked me in the eye multiple times and never acknowledged to help me. I received my order and left. This place is know for good food but also know for rude and slow service unfortunately. I will never go to this place again and take my business somewhere else.</review>

The food was really great, but what was really disappointung was the service, it was really long to be served, and this until the bill. It takes 2 hours and we were only 2...only 1 waiter was there, and all the other employees were only preparing other tables.<//text>

This is one of our most favorite restaurants with tasty meals, attentive staff, and wonderful service. For affordable eating out, enjoy their Happy Hour (4-6pm M-F) menu. If you want something more, try their Festa menu offered 2 weeks each month (check for exact dates) featuring cuisine from different regions of Italy. Their regular menu is always excellent as well.</Review>

This place barely gets a four-star rating. Overpriced, the food is good. The thing about my last visit was the waiter made me feel like I was bothering him. And a bit snooty when my friends stated she didn't care for the drink. By the way, they still charge us for the cocktail. I'm in the fast food restaurants. Comp more than they felt was necessary. I've been on the pathetic side still, it's solid Italian food.</Review>

Convenient to California Theater for symphony. Based on the price I would have expected better service (had to ask for refills on water, iced tea and coffee) and properly prepared food (potatoes under cooked and veal over cooked and tough).< /Text>

When we showed up in the evening the first night for drinks we barely got any service. When we had a reserved room for a large dinner party we got impeccable service. When we ate here out of exhaustion on our last night, we got mediocre service. The food was alright but very expensive.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Excellent Italian food served by slightly harried waiters in a comfortable setting. We both chose appetizers and an entree.

My wife had a seafood sampler from the regular menu - it was exceptional with squid, tuna, scallops, and shrimp. There was a light sauce that enhanced, not overpowered, the seafood. I chose the Jota alla Triestina (borlotti bean soup) from their Friuli menu and it was an exceptional rustic soup, hearty but not rich.

We both ordered entrees from the Friuli menu. The Risotto Miramare was excellent with perfect risotto and seafood (shrimp, calamari, crab) in every bite. Balanced with peas and tomatoes it was a fantastic meal. The Gamberoni alla Busara was amazing - prawns larger than some lobster tails sauteed in paprika, garlic, brandy, capers, marinara and cream.

After our food we didn't have dessert because we were full. But I'm excited to check back for their regional specialties coming up.<//text><userid>110201923536480543982< /userid>< Time>

< review>
solid and dependable.  it’s a chain so you can basically go anywhere and get the same consistency.  plus it has been around for a long time so there’s that.

service was slow on the saturday before christmas but to be expected.  no real issues there but just be advised.

location is in the westin san jose downtown (formerly the saint claire).  parking in the area kinda sucks.  street meters max out at an hour and there is public lot across the street but at $6/hour and a $22 max it’s really not a bargain.  valet at the hotel is $15 for the first two hours with validation or $30 after that.  so factor that in.  dinging a star because of this.

food was solid if not remarkable.  parents had the tagliatelle and the linguine mare and i had the ravioli.  it’s tasty but not amazing (sorry, i got spoiled living in NYC for nine years).

worth a visit if in downtown SJ, mostly because italian here in general is very meh.  this is better than most and the decor is great.< /review>

Terrible service. The staff and our waiter specifically could care less about you or the food or your experience there. One star was for the food which was ok but they still got the order wrong. Had to ask the guy several times for water, which finally came half way through our meal. He didn't check up on us until we had virtually finished lunch, and all he said was "thanks" while walking away and dropping off the check to us. I'd understand if it was really busy but he had three tables including us. I've had better service from Del Taco.</text>

<rating>4< /rating><review>I've been dining at this restuarant (at this location) for nearly 20 years and the food is always good.  I wish I could say that about the service.  Lately, meaning for the last 1-2 years, service has been slow.  Slow to ask for drinks, slow to take food orders, slow to serve the food.

I like the food (angel hair, risotto, calamari, desserts, etc..), and it's one of my favorite Italian restaurants, but I hope the service improves.

Food 5, service 3.<//review>< Pictures>

The food is bland, small portioned, and overpriced.  Our server looked like he didn't want to be there. He even seemed irritated to give me a drink refill. I know life is sometimes hard, but don't take it out on your paying customers. Won't be back.< /Text>

We stopped in here before a show downtown. The ambiance was ok, it was around 6pm and the afternoon sun was blazing thru the windows making it pretty warm in there. I had the Tagletell bolognese and my husband had the veal. Both were good sized portions. My pasta was great. It was toothsome and perfectly al dente. The bolognese sauce was quite tasty. My husband's veal however, not so good. The sauce was lemony and bright but the veal was tough and the thin coating of flour that should have been crispy was kinda gummy. The vegetable side was a giant broccoli stem and carrot that were undercooked. The food came out fast, which was nice since we were eating pre- show, but we had to ask several times for bread (it finally came to our table after our food arrived), and our waters were never refilled. The place was fairly busy but it was a Wednesday evening at 6pm. Overall I would say this place is ok if you get pasta, but they really need to improve their service.<//review>

It is what the client or customer gets out of it thats how you feel when you come here  awesome place and the best food you'll get Downtown San jose.

<text>The restaurant is a really big space inside a hotel so it may not be as easy to get to. We went on a lazy Sunday afternoon so there were very few guests. The service staff was small for the big space so they had to walk around a lot, making the service slow but I don't blame them, especially since they have a nice row of window seats facing the VTA train outside. The bread they served before the meal was cold, and not nice to eat, but an old waiter came around to give us olive oil and vinegar which was nice. I ordered a chicken pasta and it was actually quite delicious. I ordered it as Secondi (a smaller portion) and it came out perfectly sized, just enough for me. You may want a Primi portion if you are hungry.</text>< pictures>

Ordered the Pennoni Alla Vodka-Primi Portion(small) through door dash for $14.50 and was extremely disappointed at the portion size I received. Additionally, no utensils were provided making it inconvenient. The flavor was alright (a little more bacon than traditional vodka)  but again for close to $15 I would have expected more... I would not recommend.<//text>

House made pastas are solid, excellent desserts, good coffee, I'll be back without question.  Butternut ravioli was excellent, veal & artichoke was decent, solid Tiramisu, great vanilla ice cream with espresso. Wines by the glass are worth a look after I tried the Chianti Classico for $8 I'd be willing to try others. Come during the week for the 430pm Happy hour prices for $3 beer and $5 wine by the glass.</text>

We had dinner at Il Fornaio on Friday evening and it was a disappointing dining experience.
The restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived, but it took the front door a while to seat us.   It then took our server a while to take our drink order, and by then we were ready to order our entrees.
Bread came warm to the table, which was one of the highlights of the meal.  My cannellini bean soup was the other highlight - rich, hearty, and flavorful.
3 out of the 4 entrees were less than expected - the meat in my bolognese sauce was very dry.  My friend got the grilled salmon (on the specials menu) and it was overcooked.  The spinach that came with it looked like it was previously frozen - it was gray and wilted.  My husband got the rigatoni with the vodka cream sauce and it was just meh.  The dishes lacked presentation and flavor, and several items were overcooked.
Service was cordial but on the slower side.
I don't think we'll return to Il Fornaio any time soon.<//Text>

Was very delicious. Even the kids menu food was hand prepared and scrumptious.< /Text>

<Text>is this italian food? or is this olive garden? im not sure. pastas over cooked. causes watery and improperly seasoned. prices are too much for the quality food that was served. luckily a vendor paid for the meal or i and my wallet would have went home crying. also an empty restaurant kind of is a telling sign. then again maybe it was a normal tuesday night.<//Text>< Pics>

Never disappoints me. The place feels like home, the food is outstanding, the service is great.  Always looking for excuses to eat here. A bit pricey< /Review>

Il Fornaio is a cut above the rest. They have amazing food, great decor, and always make you feel like royalty. I love coming here every month for their Festa Regionale - where they pick a region of Italy, and their amazing chefs create a menu that reflects the flavors and culture of that region. The tasting menu is $31 and includes 3 courses. I go every month and have yet to be disappointed. I highly recommend this place!! On their regular menu, I'd suggest the Pennoni Alla Vodka or any of their Ravioli dishes.</Review>

food was ok, not great; service was mediocre, generally fairly slow; whole restaurant was far too warm and somehow they couldn't figure out how to adjust; wine was served (and therefore stored) at (warm) room temperature. Generally, the restaurant felt old fashioned / tired.
would not go back.<//text>

Il Fornaio has been generous to our soup kitchen, Martha's Kitchen. Aaron Dean, Executive Chef was the winner of our Celebrity Chef competition at the Capital Club.  The manager, Sergio Lopez is always willing to help the community.</review>

I come to Il Fornaio a few times a year. Each time I am blown away by the service and quality of food. Kenneth Johns is an exceptional manager- the establishment is always clean- and our server Ihab did a fantastic job taking care of us.  I strongly recommend the Filet Mignon cooked rare or the Cannoli Al Forno which comes on a sizzling plate.  I've also been here for breakfast, and can say without a doubt that is the best breakfast anywhere nearby.  Take my word for it, I review many places around the world, Il Fornaio will always hold a place in my heart.</text>

Good food and service. It's an Italian restaurant so you'll spend a lot of time here. It's not a quick in and out dining experience but it's worth it.</Review>

Pretty overpriced for the quality of food. This place is where one goes on a team lunch and someone brings the corporate amex. The portions are decent, there never seems to be a wait, and the staff hurried.</Text>
