DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. They will scam you. I forget the name of the representative who talked to me but this guy outright lied to me. He got me into buying a jetpack for 30 dollars and when even after I repeatedly asked him if I was getting in a contract or not, he said I was not. After I tried the product I tried to cancel the plan only to find I was in a 24 month contract, hence the low price, according to the phone representative. My bad for getting scammed under such obvious circumstances, but I just can't believe how they can lie to your face like this. Verizon has a great network but they're awful when it comes to customer service, and this store should be their flagship for mistreating customers. I will be coming back and talking to more people at Verizon because this shouldn't happen. I asked the guy 3 times if I was getting on a contract and he said no. In fact he slid a page with some very simple cancellation terms, which I clearly didn't sign, so I don't know how they're planning to get away with this. DO NOT COME HERE. If you really want to get on Verizon's network go to a corporate store. These people are con artists.</text>

<review>I added my parents on to my existing Verizon  account. But never have I had such great service. Krysnie was so knowledgeable and helpful. We asked too many questions. And not once did she get bothered. She went above and beyond. And her co worker or Manager Anthony. Was also very helpful in many ways. They make a great team together. I’m also bringing my sister over from sprint. To join Verizon. Thank you once again Krysnie and Anthony.<//review>< Pics>

<text>I will never go back to this store again. I've purchased multiple upgrades for phones in the past with no problems but this last experience really disappointing and frustrating. I went in to upgrade my iphone 5s to a iphone 7. I was helped by Taylor Shelton. Things started off fine and she started explaining how we could change our plan, save money and on top of that get a free tablet in the process. Part of the appeal was "no contract" by paying 79.99 for some type of customer loyalty program. What she conveniently failed to mention was that I was entering into a 2 year contract with the tablet. I even asked to see a breakdown or printout of the things I was signing up for before paying. Taylor claimed nothing was really available to show that. Confused, I paid my balance for my iphone and she followed by getting out a customer agreement and began highlighting the important parts of the contract! This customer agreement was the very thing i asked before paying and was denied. Once she handed it to me I noticed things like early termination fee, $70 dollar restocking, and a 2 year contract. If I would have been given a chance to review this "customer agreement" I would have never agreed to the tablet. But I wasn't. Only after the fact was I able to read these details. Why call it a customer agreement if I wasn't give a chance to agree to the terms?! I'm not even sure that is legal? Once I was able to grasp how I was badly misled, I immediately returned the tablet. And got stuck paying a 70 dollar restocking fee. Furthermore, I reached out to the manager Kenny and explained what happened. He said he would talk to customer support and he never followed up with me. He is also very difficult to reach with no representative willing to provide a schedule so I can call at the right time. Never dealing with this store ever again, bottom line. I will buy from Apple or Verizon directly.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Beware of this store. The manager flat out lied to us and kept giving us the runaround, not allowing us to speak to the regional manager - had to call Verizon corporate to get it resolved and they told us not to go to this store again as they're not being honest.</review>< Pics>

Surprisingly large selection of items and I've always had friendly service there. They have some interesting snacks and things if you look closely enough, and some nice quality snacks, too. This is my go-to place in Bernal Heights for snacks.</text>

The BLAT is fantastic: they don't skimp on the bacon or the avocado and it is accompanied by ripe fresh fruit on the side.  Each sandwich is carefully crafted so allow a little time.  Try the spicy mango sauce on the side. Super friendly service as well.</text>

<review>They have an extensive signature sandwich selection. My favorite is the Cortland Crunch on Sweet Roll toasted. Sandwiches are huge, tasty, and prices are great. The complex unity of ingredients is impressive - depending on the sandwich you choose. They also offer a nice selection of Mediterranean sides, which can sell out. The deli is inside a grocery store that is clean, organized, and well stocked. The staff provides excellent service too. It's a great casual neighborhood spot.</review>< pics>

<review>I’m NEVER coming back! My 3rd time asking for certain foods in my sandwich and it never done the way I’ve asked I’m not sure if It’s being done to me on purpose so that I don’t return or whatever the case may be But my sandwich always cost me $10 or more and you never is right it’s never added all the ingredients my husband ordered a beef sandwich and when I brought it to him it was really made horrible my husband said he will never go back there and I’m not either<//review>< Pictures>

10/30/2020.  I used to go to Huong Lan for Vietnamese sandwiches.  But it is far since now I’m working from home.  Found this place on Google map and it has a pretty good review.  So I decided to try it out.  Picked up a grilled pork and a grilled chicken sandwich.  It took a long time but I think they prepared the meat after the order so it was worth the waiting.  Next time I’ll order first.  A bit pricey though.<//Review>

Most of good review here but when Our folks called in (we worked nearby) for a taste and here was a response “We dont take order over the phone please order thru our website”. I guess they dont need sales during this pandemic and I get it.<//text>

This is my favorite fresh, organic, local restaurant. The food is amazingly delicious. Not only do they have the best Pho 🍲 I have ever tasted, they do tasty curries and more. I love combining fresh coconut juice straight from the coconut with my meals and it’s a naturally sweat and healthy option for the kids 👍.

The owner, Quinn ( I call her The Mighty Quinn 😉 ) checks in with her customers to make sure they are satisfied with their meals and enjoyed the Qochon experience.

I do miss visiting the restaurant during the SIP and am grateful they are able to continue to stay open and serve the community.

They are open for take out and delivery from Monday- Friday 11am - 5pm. They have a simple online order platform at QOCHON.COM. They offer free delivery to all orders over $25 and are located within a 10 miles radius.

Currently, they are running a campaign called GIFT-A-MEAL. Customers can purchase egift cards for meal donations to local frontline workers. Or you can donate directly on their website. Every $500 we raise equates to 50 meals. There is no minimum for donations so anyone can gift any amount you are comfortable with.

I highly recommend Qochon!<//text>

<Review>I like the food, very fresh veggies...what I really wish they had was lightly sauteed Tofu, it is very heavily fried. They also don't serve chicken breast. If you want leaner protein, you are out of luck, otherwise high quality and yummy!<//Review>< rate>

Came here from Malaysia the past 3 years. This place has the best authentic Vietnamese food in the city. The owner put a lot of effort into their foods and drinks, freshly source organic ingredients. The Vietnamese coffee are sourced in person in Vietnam.<//Review>

Had the pork chop with cut rice.  There are a variety of choices including pho.  Nice atmosphere even though my seat was at the largest shared table.  No complementary soup or tea.</review>

< Review>
They have limited menu items but ample vegetarian options. Loved the food quality and taste! Their kumquat lemonade is out of thw world!! The only downside is that they are closed on Sundays. This is our goto place for eating out on a Saturday!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The food is ok, but the checkout should pay attention to the bill already including the tip, and almost asked by the clerk to pay more.

<Text>This is one of our area's best restaurants! The atmosphere was wonderful, and the staff was extremely pleasant. They may also be able to make excellent coffee. We had a great time reading the pocket book they offered while sipping delicious coffee. I will certainly return, and I would strongly advise others to do so.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is our 2nd visit to this coffee shop.
We ordered the English Muffin Fried Egg sandwich,  Avocado Toast, Mixed Green salad, Vanilla Latte and Honey Lavander Latte. Breakfast was good and the coffee very good. Will visit again when we return to LA.< /Review>< user>

<text>The employee was friendly, the store was clean, and the chocolate chip scone was delicious! However the coffee was a huge disappointment. My flavored latte (horchata) was nearly tasteless and tasted watery. My partners flavored latter (caramel) was the opposite - way too sweet. The cafe was cute but unfortunately the coffee we got was just not good at all. And for $4.50+ lattes, that's not gonna be worth another trip.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Because of the reviews and the stars, I decided to give Board House Coffee a try. I am an avid caffeine drinker so I came to try their oatmilk latte. I took my daughter on a date and she ordered the hummus sandwich and I ordered the avocado toast (without cream cheese) The latte was delicious. I would buy it again, but order it extra hot. The avocado toast was kinda plain, BUT very tasty. I love the lemon pepper they sprinkle on top. I've started using different seasoning at home after having theirs. My daughter enjoyed her hummus sandwich (she's hard to please) Our only  problem we encountered was friendliness. I'd encourage the staff, to give more communication (acknowledgement) eye contact and kindness especially to those who seem to be studying the menu. When my daughter asked for a straw. It was placed on the counter and the lady turned and walked away. People are stressed today (especially) so go the extra mile.<//text>

<text>This coffee shop was recommended to my dad. It's a perfect place to drink the region's best coffee, which supplements their delicious meals well! Its atmosphere is homely, and the menu offers a variety of dishes and beverages. It is well-conditioned, and the music played on the speakers was generally beautiful. Really, a must-visit coffee shop!</text>< pics>

My order was simple for the waiter to entertain, and in a matter of 20 minutes my order was already on my table. The dishes and the coffee were delicate and delicious. I, however, enjoyed it tremendously. The atmosphere was also peaceful, fragrant, and relaxed. Lastly, this shop was rewarding and captivating. Well, uh, thanks!</text>

I was recommended this place by a friend and I loved it! Honestly, there aren't many breakfast places in Irvine that I like but the proved to be a new favorite.  Breakfast tends to be one of the unhealthier of the meals but they are able to have a healthier twist on it while still making it delicious.  The prices are a bit higher than what you'd expect but the quality and freshness cannot be questioned.  I had the fried egg sandwich because I wanted something to fill me up and it really did. The bacon was surprisingly crispy and the sauce that came with the potatoes was one of my favorite things on the plate.  The iced chai was super refreshing and they have the option to substitute for oat or almond milk.  There aren't many seats inside but there is plenty of seating outside when it gets crowded.  Definitely coming back to try what else is on the menu.</text>

My new favorite local spot. Feels like a healthy and home cooked meal. Had the Chicken Salad Sandwich and Cold Brew Coffee, both of which were exceptional. But the service really puts this place over the top.

It's clear the proprietors really love this place and have a passion for serving people. It's evident in the details and in the staff. You will quickly feel right at home. I can't wait to go back and try more of what they have to offer.<//review>

Very good avocado grilled cheese panini. I get it delivered through GrubHub and it’s ready on time when the driver gets there. It’s a little pricey for a small sandwich. Though, I do have to say it is very tasty.
Hope to be able to sit down inside once the pandemic is over.< /text>

Update: was contacted and correction was made

Went here a few times and order the same thing: Oatmeal w strawberries $4.9?.  Yesterday for some reason I was charged $6.?? (Noticed $1 change for strawberries). I won’t be going back for this reason along with their lack of repeated customer service skills.</review>

Great coffee. Nice guy behind the counter. And fairly cheap! I was expecting a level of hipsterdom that I wasn't necessarily prepared for, but it was really just great. Totally worth parking for and if you're walking then you pretty much have to get in there.</text>

I finally found a breakfast place that everyone can agree on at work! It's so delicious and the coffee is my favorite, so smooth and not acidic. I love getting half protein açaí bowl and either half a mañana sandwich or half sereno or avocado toast and share with a friend. It's so filling I don't eat again until dinner time. They have amazing pastries too! I love the blueberry muffin and scones.<//text>

Didn't really try the food, only had a cold brew, which was good. Service was good enough for counter ordering. 5 stars mostly for convenient parking (lot, street, and underground) and pretty large seating area. Perfect for stopping by after hiking in the area. Seating area in the afternoon is nice and bright, A/C and fans fully going so it's a good place to escape the heat. Prices seem pretty good as well. Worth a visit to judge for yourself.< /text>

<Time>1586466452844< /Time><rating>3</rating><review>Their lavender latte was good however their avocado toast is the worst I’ve had. They use cheap basic sliced bread and hard boiled egg slices, meh. Also the toast with goat cheese and jam was the same. It’s like something I’d halfheartedly make in my own kitchen for a midnight snack. Overpriced and underwhelming.</review>< Pictures>

They serve Verve coffee here! I get the rose latte, it's delicious. The only thing is that it's dead silent in here, even though there's usually a lot of people since everyone usually studies here. But also, I definitely study here.</Review>

It's a chill place that doesn't get too packed in the mornings. They also have a few tables outside with a lovely view of Santa Monica Blvd. The only downside, I'd say, is the smell of spices and coffee on my clothes when I leave, but that might be the case with many places.

<Review>Great place to work or meet friends. Indoor and outdoor seating, plus breakfast and lunch options (including salads). The staff and manager/owner were really nice. When I told the manager I needed to do a Skype meeting, he recommended a place to sit that's typically quieter. Thanks! Will definitely be back. :-)< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>My friend and I have been coming here every Friday morning for the past three years for our weekly coffee dates. Love having a nice coffee shop in the neighborhood. I come some weekends if I want to get out of the house. I love the avocado toast. Things are more smooth now that they've fully transitioned from 8 Espressos and have had time to make it their own. Gets a little bright and warm in the mornings when the sun is shining through the big glass windows, but the umbrellas they put up seem to be helping a bit. We really love Joy, one of the baristas who's been around since before the transition to The Board House from 8 Espressos. I also love the local feel, and seeing the same faces every week. Great place, feel so thankful to have it just a few minutes walk away. (There is also a parking lot.)< /text>< Pictures>

Board House Coffee is a coffee shop close to my friend’s house with whom I usually stay when I go to LA. My friend does not have WiFi at home and I always have to go to Board House Coffee because they have WiFi and the required power outlets for people who need to use them. The coffee Shop is quiet and is managed well. One can also buy coffee and refreshments if they need to. There are indoor and outdoor seating arrangements and a parking structure as well. Their services are appreciated by all. A great place to work at peace.<//Review>

Did a great job of making my mom feel really awful for unintentionally picking up the wrong coffee. Such a pity, because the environment is great and coffee not bad.</review>

<name>PS vB< /name><review>Peace!  Boardhouse Coffee is here!  I was only in LA for two weeks,  and the pace was getting to me, the continuous driving, the feeling of go-go-go.  But then I found Boardhouse Coffee, and I really recommend it:  just a gentle quiet hip subtle escape off of busy Santa Monica boulevard in West LA, it's a place to eat freshly prepared food and drink real barista coffees and teas, a place to hang, study, write, meet a friend, sit in the sun or just eat your fill on a healthy break.  Boardhouse Coffee is a neighborhood place, and it's also a classy stopover without all the hassle of chain coffee shops.  You'll be glad you went, you'll definitely go back!  I did, almost every day!

NOT FOR US! We walked in here the day after New Year's Day to grab lattes and maybe some breakfast. The woman behind the counter didn't even glance our way let alone welcome us. The food didn't look very interesting either. We hung around a couple of minutes but got the feeling this would not work out well.</text>

Board House Coffee is a new, independent Coffee Shop that serves up great coffee.

My cup of single origin Papua New Guinea had a strong, bold and rich flavor.  The quality was the best and the $1 refill made it a great value.

For breakfast, I had the bagel cream cheese lox(includes cucumber, capers, dill).  This was the best I've had in WLA.

I was very hungry, so I also had their California Club sandwich with turkey, ham, bacon, cheddar, swiss on a pretzel roll...another winner and enough food for lunch later as well.

My Maple Scone dessert had just the right flavor-not too sweet with a delicious buttery accent.

The atmosphere is great for study, meetings and also quick takeouts with parking(cafe is in Vinci Plaza).

The team of Steve and Andrew did an outstanding job being courteous and prompt with orders.

Verdict:  Board House Coffee  is my #1 choice for coffee, scones and sandwiches in WLA.

Called to order part.  Said I needed to come in and pay. Ok... I get there and PC has no idea what I'm talking about.  Spent 15m looking for part that I just called about 10m ago. PC use to be so much better,  faster and knowledgeable. Now they just hire anyone!</review>

I don't trust their word. They say they'll hold a part for and it end up being sold to someone else. Their word has no value to me. Thank you for the eye opener.</text>

I never got the name of the lady who helped me but she was the best.! While I was out I had accidentally ran over a can of spray paint and needed a product to get it off. The woman who helped me recommended me some great products and they really helped.! Thank you so much again, the spray paint came right off.!<//Review>

Just spent 30 minutes standing in line waiting for an employee to be done socializing with a customer only for another employee to tell the first to go to lunch when he was done then disappear into the back without helping anyone in line. Terrible service, and AutoZone is cheaper anyway.<//review>

<Review>These guys went above and beyond for me. Kept the store open 5 minutes later than close because I had an emergency radiator swap-out, then when I left the rubber feet attached to the old radiator, they got them for me - saved my bacon! Ever since then, I try to buy most of my parts from them! Great job, guys!< /Review></record>

So yesterday was a horrible morning I paid somone 20 bucks to jump start my car cause no one was helping me when my car died and they couldn't get started so left with my 20 and me still stranded. Then a old guy stopped didnt have jumper cables but said O'Reilly's was up the street and they would probably have a jumper I could borrow. So I walked there and sure enough they did and the amazing lady that works there was told she could walk with me to help she carried that jumper all the way to my car I asked if I could help and she said nope I got it. Her kindness was amazing we need morning caring people like me and her. She definitely went above and beyond and I appreciate her 100% Debbie ty so very much for your kindness♡</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Bad service to staff. I don't know if bad luck has touched me every time I go to that place, they don't serve me well. Why I have ordered parts and they are brought incorrectly or sent to other places this last time I was the person who attended to me did not put much interest in what I needed was distracted with a work problem with his colleagues I better end up canceling and I went to Autosone where without any problem they treated me very soon

(Original)
Mal servicio al personal . No sé si me a tocado mala suerte cada que voy a esa local no me atienden bien . Por qué he ordenado partes y las traen incorrectas o las mandan a otros locales está última vez que fui la persona que me atendió no me puso mucho interés en lo que yo necesitaba estaba distraída con un problema de trabajo con sus compañeros mejor termine por cancelar y me fui a Autosone dónde sin ningún problema me atendieron muy pronto</review>< GmapID>

Came here with friends on a Friday night for dinner. The fried chicken was great and I had at least three of those Palmoas (they're strong, watch out!). A+ experience, will be back.</Review>

Eureka is good upscale southern inspired food. It’s not quite traditional southern food, it’s elevated, with a California feel to it. The bar is always hoppin’ and the several small dining rooms are cozy and always pretty full. Service is great. The food doesn’t quite have a wow factor that would make me want to give it 5 stars, but I always thoroughly enjoy it.< /review>

I love Eureka. I go to be with friends at the bar . The bartenders remember my drink but are not presumptuous. The food is good, sometimes a little spicy. The owners and staff make the place warm and comfortable.<//Text>

Best fried chicken served in the Castro!  Comfort food all round, tho in a non-diner setting, it's a most comfortable space; when the weather's agreeable reserve back patio table and should your party need a place to meet for the evening's start, consider the upstairs bar an ideal beginning.  There's much to enjoy from the menu, items rotate perodically, and favorites always return.</review>

Some hits and misses. Fried chicken is super popular. Caeser salad is simply awful! Popular spot, pretty surroundings and excellent service!< /Review>

<text>Cozy and stylish house of Southern comfort offerings with a San Francisco touch highlight this bustling lounge and dining stalwart in The Castro. Roasted or fried chicken, pot roast and jambalaya dot the menu. Black-eyed peas, mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts - all tasty sides. Friendly, informed service abounds. Substantial wine selections for this small eatery and drinks exceed expectations.<//text>< username>

Came here for a drink with friends after dinner but we were so enticed by the menu that we had to get a couple of apps.  We ordered the pork grinds and pork belly.  Both were delicious.  The onion relish that comes with the pork grinds goes really well together.  The pork belly is melt in your mouth delicious.

The service was extremely nice and the place was pretty busy.  Decor is super cute.  Can't wait to come back to try their dinner entrees one night.</Review>

<Text>Eureka Restaurant & Lounge has remained a beacon for all of us looking for a place to park our cushy posteriors, escape the doldrums (or hurricanes) of everyday life and just enjoy cocktails and food served by the friendliest staff in an atmosphere that is welcoming, warm, tasteful, relaxing, unpretentious and cozy! It's like Cheers, where everyone knows your name...but throw in a rainbow unicorn. :)

Over the past few years, I've visited Eureka numerous times with family, friends, co-workers and blind dates (guilty as charged) for occasions ranging from birthdays to engagements to happy hours to work meetings to venting sessions to break ups (again...guilty as charged). And every time, the food, the service, the staff and the atmosphere has been consistently FAHbulous!

Whether its their inventive cocktail menu (Vesper anyone?) or their delicious food menu (Fried Chicken, Chicken Livers, Okra, Pot Roast, Deviled Eggs, Steak and just this week Shrimp and Grits!!!) or their wonderful and extremely hard-working service staff, they hit it out of the ballpark each and every time.

My husband (yes, why thank you!) and I go to Eureka for date night every Friday and we both look forward not only to the food and drinks, the friendly staff, the owners who are always around to greet you, the AHmazing atmosphere that permeates even my jaded heart and makes me smile, the smiles and laughs from all the diners as they catch up on each others lives and friends old and new meet, but also the sense of being in a place that is warm and welcoming and a respite from the harsh and cold world...well, foggy and windy since this IS San Francisco. There is nothing to beat that feeling!

And you can see the hard work put in by the staff, whether its managing the 530PM happy hour rush hour making sure every guest is looked after or chatting up customers asking how they are doing or asking if they want another round of cocktails or balancing 6 cocktails AND walking up the stairs with a smile on their face or just being around in case you need anything...you can see the passion, drive and hard work on their faces and its evident that Eureka is a mainstay in the Castro and its a place that truly feels wonderful every time I go there and I look forward to many, many more such wonderful times.

To the staff at Eureka...pom-poms off to ya! Keep up the good work and thank you for providing this wonderful place!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

Ordered a burger well done. It comes out pink, so I send it back to be well done, and then it comes back burnt all on the outside with a stale bun. Worst hamburger ever!< /Text>

The chicken was good the other night and I've had the burger in the past it was pretty good. Personally I come here because it's one of the few places in the Castro that can make a decent martini :-)< /review>

The staff and management was great.  My wife and I were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary.  Our friend who introduced us was coming from Piedmont to help us celebrate and it was one of those days for Bay Bridge traffic.  I am sure we messed up their reservation schedule and they remained calm cool and friendly.</text>

Cozy lounge for nibbles and well-made drinks, or dinner downstairs, or a combination of the two.  One of our go-tos for a last cocktail on an evening out - friendly and rarely loud, which is precious for the neighborhood.< /Review>

And we both had the same dish "pot roast" because we both love it and it was as good as it gets!:) It was really delicious, not too dry, perfect. I finished everything even I was full already.

< Review>
Ambience - Quite nice. Good place to chill.
Fried Chicken - Quite good. Very generous portion.
Grilled Salmon - Great. Good portion served with mashed potato and vegetable. Personally I liked it more than fried chicken.
Service staff - very friendly and pleasant. Best service I experienced during my visit to San Fran!
My friends enjoyed their steak too!

I was there a few days ago with my friends (a group of 8) while visiting castro street in San Francisco. Their service staff set a table for us at the upper floor, their bar & lounge. The ambience was nice and definitely felt like a good place to chill. They even brought lit candles to our table!!!

Shorlty after we placed our order, ice water, bread and butter were served before our ordered food came. Being asians, we usually dont like bread that much but we tried theirs and we loved it. And the waiting staff very thoughtfully brought us another serving of bread after seeing how much we enjoyed it! Two thumbs up!!!! And they let my friend try their wine first before she ordered one and she enjoyed her wine too.

Our food came soon enough and as I said ealier, we all enjoyed their food and service.

Overall, a great experience and the best service among a few restaurants we went during our short visit to LA, Vegas and San Fransisco.

P.S. I dont usually write reviews. In fact, this is my first time writing a review here. Their service was so good that I had to write one. :)< /Review>

No plant based / vegan items on the menu and only one (seemingly) vegetarian one, which is surprising both given this day and age and, location (San Francisco).<//Review>

All the stores are super clean, everything well maintained. While I wouldn't go out of my way to shop at Target here or any of the other mall stores you can find anywhere, there are some great food and dessert options here, which is the reason why I came and I'm sure I'll be back as there were a few other places I still want to try here.<//Text>< Pictures>

quite possibly the most diverse strip mall in the Brentwood/West Los Angeles area. so let's say you're hungry... how about some Mexican, Italian, Vietnamese, Japanese or Indian? or maybe just a subway sandwich. feeling kinda fatty fat fat after eating? no worries, take a few steps to the manual arts studio or the yoga spot. what if you spill your lunch on your clothes... guess what... dry cleaners just around the adjacent bend... and after all is said and done maybe you'd like to make send something out to a friend cross country... kinkos/FedEx at your service. HINT: If you like Indian food, India tandoori has an awesome lunch buffet!<//review>

A well-organized, spacious mall, a big food court.    Everything in here was impressive. They have a playroom, salon, spa,  and even an activity center for grown-ups.   On each floor, they had customer service. The parking was space can accommodate a lot of vehicles. The staves were very attentive and professional. What a lovely mall to shop with.< /text>

What's not to love about Westfield!Easy access from the Powell Street BART station with two entrances give you easy access to the food court as well as to the closest Starbucks for that caffeine fix.< /Review>

Couldn't thank this addiction treatment center enough for encouraging me to quit drugs for good. Though it was probably the toughest 90-days that I have ever experienced, the tough parts during rehab. were worth it as I've now made my dream of living drug-free a reality. Thank you all for being the catalyst to changing my life for the better and for showing me that I deserve nothing less than a sober life.<//Review>

My mom no longer suffers from alcoholism thanks to this Los Angeles addiction treatment facility. The staff ensured that we could call at any time to receive updates about her recovery. They always answered our calls to provide us with that information. Thank you for restoring my mom's life, making it easy for everyone throughout her treatment.<//Text>

<review>This is a great drug rehab center in Los Angeles and their facility is fantastic. We took my brother here because he had a nasty cocaine addiction and it was really messing up his life. After he did his treatment, he really wised up and committed to changing his life around. He's been sober for two years, owns his own home and has a stable job. All thanks go to this rehab center.< /review>< user_id>

< review>
I go to Granville plaza for 3 of the businesses there.( Fedex kinkos,subway, and Affair with the Plate.)  The parking is ample but I believe it is cash only which i always forget until i am there. The closest ATM is unfortunately across wilshire and down half a block (while your time is adding up) That part annoys me as I usually don't carry cash. There are a few free 15 minute spots where the businesses are in front...but those fill up quickly. They need to either accept cards or get an ATM in my opinion.</review>

Came to this treatment center a couple of months ago to detox and then took an outpatient program so I could stop using drugs. I wasn't really happy with this but at the end they could get me sober and I’m living better life.< /Review>

<text>My meth. addiction destroyed everything in its path. The relationships to my family, friends, my job...almost everything really. Thanks to this private drug recovery program here, I am slowly but surely getting back on my feet. My drug addiction officially feels like a part of my past and I'm confident in successfully facing the new challenges that come my way. Thank you for my newfound confidence as well as my sobriety.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

We contacted Jim, and he was here the next day, right when he said he'd be.  Contactless, safe, efficient, on-site shredding service gave us peace of mind that our confidential information was taken care of properly.  You can even watch via video as everything is being shredded.  Jim's a heck of a nice guy, and we'll call him again for sure should we have the need.   Highly recommend his business!   For all you working from home now and have confidential and secure items to shred, give this guy your business!< /Review>

Jim was really terrific! I had completely forgotten about our appointment and about the name forgotten about the name of his company inSITE I didn't recognize it on my phone. So I didn't answer the phone the first time. I was over at my parents house which is On the same property and he knocked on their door and got a response from them that I would be heading to my house and he could knock again so he did and he was very very patient as I am handicapped and had to use my cane to go.back upstairs to get the keys to the Jeep that we had put all the shredding into and for me to go get a mask. He was wonderfully patient with me and went above and beyond iin
service and patience I would call this company again in a minute I already recommended him to my parents who are also going to be doing a lot of shredding and he was right on with his quote too he didn't overcharge me it was the price we had agreed to I can't praise this company enough as I'm sure you can tell from this review.<//Text>

When Jim came over, it was fun to watch my papers that needed to be shred go through the shedder. There's a cool camera on the side of the truck that lets you watch the whole thing. For 9 boxes, I didn't have to pay very much, and the whole thing took less than 10 minutes. I will definitely use this service again.<//Text>< Pictures>

Jim is AWESOME!! He is such a nice man, pleasure to work with, extremely accommodating, punctual, and great with communication. His prices are so reasonable! We have used him twice, and if it weren’t for us moving, we would use inSITE as our go to company for shredding. You can’t go wrong with Jim @ inSITE Shredding, great guy, great business!</review>

We had years of income tax records that needed to be shredded.  It is time-consuming to do it on our small home shredder.  Jim took it out to his truck and had it shredded in under 10 minutes. Great service!< /Text>

<text>We scheduled a pick up from Jim right after Thanksgiving. He showed up to our house and took our documents and shredded right in our front yard. It was great and he allowed us to view the process giving us full confidence that our privacy is secure. I highly recommend to everyone for convenience, safety & overall great service.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
I found inSITE shredding on Yelp while searching for a shredding service for my senior parents. They had 20+ years of documents tucked away in storage. This service was so incredibly easy from getting a quote to arrival and completion of the job.
I simply texted with images of the boxes piled up. I received a very reasonable quote within hours and they were available to come out next day!
Jim arrived and got right to work. We could not believe how fast he got all those papers loaded and shredded. He was professional, friendly and so efficient. I highly recommend inSITE and would not hesitate to contact them for future shredding service.</Review>

<Text>Prompt, efficient, friendly and professional all describe Jim at inSITE Shredding. Need Shredding done this is the company I recommend. I will be referring my friends. I know we all have boxes and boxes of papers that we have never looked at in all the years they have been in the closet. Get rid of them and free up your closets by calling Jim at inSITE Shredding. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>< Rating>

<review>Jim was quick to respond to my initial inquiry.  His timing was prompt and worked efficiently with the many bags of paper I had to shred.  It's a wonderful and convenient service to offer, and reasonably priced.  Beats the heck out of hauling a van load of paper to a place where I'd have to do most of the work.  Jim's service is definitely worth the investment.  And, he had the job done within 30 minutes.  Thanks Jim!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>Jim was extremely easy to work with.  I’ve never had a personal need for shredding services, but my in-laws had a fire in their garage and this prompted a need to finally clean out a bunch of old stuff, including paperwork from the multiple businesses they’ve owned over the last 30 years.

I left an email on Sunday afternoon and got a response back that evening with availability.  He was able to come to my work and shred all the documents right there in the parking lot as I unloaded them from the back of my truck.

He was their on time and gave me a text when he was 15 minutes away.  We were done with our transaction in under 10 minutes.

Very satisfied with the pricing and convenience.  I will certainly use this service again if the need arises and won’t hesitate to recommend Jim to friends, family and coworkers.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Jim was very responsive he responded quickly and worked with me and my schedule to schedule the service. After we scheduled the service I had to change the date, he was very accommodating with my last minute cancel. On our scheduled day I was all set to go and had reached out to confirm our time. He was even able to come early! It only took a few minutes to get everything loaded and shredded and before I knew it we were done! It took me WAY longer to go through things than it was for him to get the job done. I shopped around for home shredding services and glad I found this! His prices can’t be beat and the convenience of being at home during these times was great! Maintained our social distancing and wore our masks. Overall a great experience. I Have already recommended him to my family and friends and would recommend to anyone who has a need for a shredding service!< /Review>

<Text>Excellent job, from the scheduling experience to actually getting my materials shredded. I didn't do a great job preparing the file cabinet and totes of papers I had, meaning I didn't remove things from hanging folders, remove metal, etc. Even with those challenges, and during a pandemic, the entire experience was fast, courteous and easy to handle. Definitely will use inSITE for any other shredding needs I have, and will be recommending them to family as they digitize their documents.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Great shredding service!  I am the owner of an extremely small business in an out-of-the-way location. I arranged to meet Jim from inSITE shredding at a local parking lot on my round of customer visits and errands. Very efficient for my schedule. And a MUCH better price for one-time modest amount of document shredding than the other quotes I received. Plus he was very friendly and communicated excellently.</Review>

<Text>I found inSITE Shredding through a simple Google search.  I went to their website and filled out the instant quote form.  Jim got back to me in minutes, and we scheduled the shredding for the following day.  He showed up on time and had everything done in less than 10 minutes.  He even showed me the live video feed so that you can see your materials being shredded.  The price was as quoted, and Jim was professional and even took time to pick up some scraps that fell out while filling his bin.  I would definitely use again for all of my shredding needs.</Text>< Pictures>

There literally is no job too small - I had a bunch of old bank statements and receipts required for shedding (would have taken hours for me to shred) but less then a bankers' box. Fast response time!! Very easy to schedule (flexible). Professional and courteous.  Arrived within a 2-hour window PLUS notified me as soon as he was close.   I was also able to watch my documents get shredded was well.  I preferred this over using a 'drop off' location at Staples, FedEx, etc ... It may be a little pricey; but at least getting a quote was a complete breeze.  Thanks again!<//Text>

I just had Jim come by for the second time this year - he was right on time and completed the job while I watched.  I combined my job with one of my neighbors to come up with 15 file boxes so we got a great deal!  Beats the heck out of dragging them to a local store, paying more, and then having to insist that they put them in their bin and then trust that it actually gets shredded!  I won't use anyone else.  Note: there is a minimum charge but I figure it's worth it even if you only have 5 boxes.<//Text>

Jim was quick to respond with pricing and availability.  He showed up on time and was efficient with his work.  A pleasure work with and definitely recommend using his service if you have sensitive documents to get rid of securely.  He comes to you and you can watch the shredding via a monitor.  Will definitely use him again when needed!</text>

<review>I would highly recommend Insite Shredding. As a facilities director, it’s sometimes difficult to find great and reliable vendors - but Jim at Insite  was fast, professional, and able to work with a very tight scheduling window. I now have a go-to vendor for shredding here, and highly recommend them.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I emailed inSite at 11AM and received an almost immediate response from Jim.  He said that the soonest that he could be here was between 12 and 2PM.  He arrived at 12:30 and shredded our 17 boxes in minutes.  It is refreshing to do business with a business owner that is not only very congenial, but anxious to provide excellent service.    Thanks inSite, we will be using your services in the future and wholly recommend your services to anyone.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We had about 50 boxes of paperwork damaged by some flooding in my storage area at my condo complex. Suffice it to say, we did not want to shred all of these semi-damp papers by hand.  Jim and inSITE Shredding came to our rescue, dumping the papers out of our boxes into their bins, which they brought out to their truck to shred while we waited.  Everything was done within about 45 minutes.  Between the fast, friendly, and professional service and the incredibly low price compared to other similar mobile shredding services, I would highly recommend inSITE to anyone who needed on-site shredding.< /Review>

They were very courteous and even called to see if they could arrive earlier than they were scheduled. When they arrived they worked fast and clean.

Jim arrived on time and shredded my documents in a matter of minutes that would have taken me hours with a normal paper shredder. He wore a mask, was friendly and professional, and I'm pretty sure he charged me less than the amount cited on his website. Five stars!<//Text>

I am very happy to have done business with inSite Shredding.
Jim was very prompt and pleasant when I called to make an appointment.
He showed up on time and pulled his truck right in front of my house and was very efficient in shredding 30 boxes of paperwork.
He is pleasant to talk to and he gave me a great price!
I will recommend him to my business clients and friends !<//text>

I called and his answering service took my contact info. Jim called me within 15 or so minutes. Made an appt and he came to my house on time, as scheduled. With a mask on, he knocked on the door and backed up about 15 feet for social distancing.

He took a bin to where I had the boxes of documents, and wheeled them to the shredder. I watched the live video feed of my documents getting shredded. This was important to me knowing that I actually saw my documents fall into the chute and shredded by the shredder...as opposed to taking the documents and promise to shred once they get to their plant. Everything was done in less than 15minutes.

Nice guy and great service. Thank you!!< /text>

We were cleaning out a storage unit and had 25 banker’s boxes full of papers for shredding.  We called inSITE shredding because they also provide service to residential properties and because of the great reviews.  We were not disappointed.  Their website is clear on how to prepare the materials for shredding so that they can be recycled after shredding, which is very important to us.  I contacted inSITE for a quote and Jim got back to me right away, gave me a quote and set up a time window when he could be there.  Communication was very good.  He came right to our storage unit, where we met him. Jim was friendly, very professional and helpful.  Shredding process was quick and we could watch the shredding through a TV monitor giving us the piece of mind that our documents were treated properly.  Jim even broke down all the boxes as he went so we could take them to recycling.  Prices were very reasonable and would definitely call him again.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</review>

inSite Shredding made the process so very easy. All I did was Request a Quote from their website, which was very reasonable, and ask to schedule a site visit. I received both and email and voicemail later that day offering the first available appointment times. I was busy, so had to delay the appointment to the following week. But Jim arrived on time, was friendly, and quickly destroyed the 10 boxes of records my mother had hoarded over the last 50 years. I got to watch the shredding as it occurred on the truck mounted equipment. Good job!< /Review>

inSITE is amazing!  I had 8 banker's boxes of docs to shred.  I considered doing it myself but very glad I went with inSITE.  Here's how easy: I filled out the online estimate and contact form.  I knew exactly how much it cost right away.  No waiting for quotes, no additional fees.  What you see is what you get.  Jim called me within minutes and scheduled a 2-hour window.  Guys came right at the first minute of that window, picked up boxes right at my door, and job done in 5 minutes.  It would've taken me an hour to shred all that.  You can also watch the shredding, which I appreciated since it was high confidential docs.  Highly recommend inSITE!< /Review>

awesome mobile shredding business, communicative, flexible for my schedule, showed on time, got years of business records outta my hair, shredded on site quickly and efficiently.  Very friendly and super easy to work with.  I will call them again when I need to shred more than 3 pieces of paper!!</text>

Once I contacted inSITE I almost immediately heard back and we scheduled a time that worked for me even though I had specific time request. The day of shredding came and it was so easy and fast. We had a good amount of paper and it was done in 30 minutes for a great price. Highly recommend!</Review><gmap_id>0x808e344326c74049:0xd8b197c2067411c0< /gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp><name>Katelyn Dietz<//name>< Date>

<review>inSITE shredded a dozen boxes of old papers: at my house (so I didn't have to move anything), quickly, in front of me (I could watch the papers being shredded), and at a very reasonable price. What a great find! I will use them again.</review>< rating>

< Review>
It was great to have them come to our house and shred our documents in front of us. We had a lot of documents that had followed us from home to home that we finally decided to get rid of. We are now moving toward keeping electronic copies rather than paper.

They kept me informed of their progress and 20 mins before arrival they texted me to let me know they were on their way. We were done in less than to minutes (11 bankers boxes) and I could watch it do its work on an internal camera. I will be using them again as soon as we can get through the next set of boxes. Great service while sheltering in place.< /Review>

inSITE shredding has the best customer service.  They are prompt, professional and down right polite. They got me an appointment for shredding the day after I called. They gave me a window of time  and they showed up exactly when they said. They even called to let me know they were almost at my location.  VERY HIGHLY  recommend them.  I will definately use them often.< /review>

If you go to inSITE's website, they have a handy online quote generator where you enter the number of boxes and your zip code, and it tells you how much it costs without having to input your personal information.  It's cheaper than bringing it somewhere, and you get to watch the whole thing shredded at your house!</Review>

When I finally went to the web to get these taken care of, I came across InSite.  I used their website's Quote form to describe the job and my location.  We communicated via text and set up the time.  As it turned out, they were nearby and were at my house in under 30 minutes.  A few minutes later, my boxes-of-papers problem was behind me.  They even charged me less than the quote since I had overestimated the amount of paper I had.  I thought the price was fair and the two-person crew was very helpful/friendly.  I would certainly use them again.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Needed to have about 6 boxes of old, old family records (tax returns going back to the '90) shredded.  I didn't trust just leaving them at Staples or OfficeDepot ; so searching around I found inSITE and did their on line quote.  The pricing was extremely reasonable (I thought) and best of all, they came to my house and did while I watched!  Bazinga.  Highly recommend using their services and next time my paperworks get out of control, I'll be calling them out again!< /Review>< Time>

This company provided professional conversation, immediately returned my phone call, was friendly and personable, reliable, and more than willing to go the extra mile with their service.  Not only did they securely shred all of my businesses documents within minutes, but they also helped me clean up and remove boxes that were left over.  This is the third shredding company I've used, and the prices were better, and so was the customer service. The workers were fast, friendly and efficient, and the owner, Jim, was more than inviting as I hoped to see all that was going on.  He took the time to tell me about the process and how and where the paper was disposed of. There was complete transparency and a high level of MORAL ETHICS in this business.  When you meet a business owner who works so hard and is so efficient, you want to take the time to let others know about their service. You will be more that satisfied with the inexpensive and professional service you recieve.</review><date>1460734175577< /date></record>

<Review>NAPA hooked it up! Need a part for a car, AutoZone needed to order it, most other places didn't have it, but these guys did. In stock. And for a lot cheaper than the other stores. Give me at location right off El Cajon Boulevard. And the guy at the counter was super awesome and friendly. Thanks guys.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I was in the La Mesa area, needing some straight 40w engine oil when I saw the NAPA sign, so I stopped in, this NAPA store is very small and does not carry alot of parts for any car but can get what you need for the next day.
I got lucky as all I needed was 1 gallon of straight 40w.
I will say the guy behind the counter was super nice and very helpful..   the end</Review>

Napa always have the right answer for the job. They might not give you the fastest answer to your problem, because they ask questions about your project to make sure you don't have take multiple trips to the store. If I have a repair I can do myself, I come here first.</text>

An unexpected surprise hidden behind the taqueria through the freezer door. The decor is warm, inviting, and trendy. The bartenders are chill and helpful. This speak-easy just has a really good vibe.</review>

Their absinthe selection is phenomenal and they know what they're doing with their cocktails! It's not too expensive, and you can leave, order tacos, and get them delivered to your table! What else could you need?

I do wish they had a spicier cocktail, because the one I was told was spicy I think just had cracked black pepper on it, but that's not enough of an issue to dock a star!<//Text>< Pictures>

Superb speak easy, tucked away inside Tacos Liberitad. Just go all the way to the back and through the large metal fridge door. Really large space with just the most unique cocktails, wine and beer.< /review>

<Review>I absolutely love this place! It's so pretty inside and so different. This is the second time around that I have visited, I didn't have as a great experience as the first time but I think it had to do with the servers that were there last night. Drinks were still tasting good BUT the first time I went a very tall slim male helped me and my girlfriends out and he was the best! He made recommendations and knew his drinks very well.</Review>< name>

Was terrific in the past, clever, chill, upscale.  It was a great place for locals and to bring out of town friends.  Now it's effectively become the taco shop dining room and reeeeks of greasy food. The pile of paper plates in the trash bin at the entrance to the bar makes for a interesting, if not unpleasant welcome.  I had to bus a spot and get rid of the paper boats to have a place for our group to sit.  Be careful of the short stools.  They're all so wobbly, shopworn, and pooly maintained that you might just end up on the floor.  The stools seems to reveal what the place has become.   But, it's still got potential.  A little attention to some details and it could be great.  The drinks were good. That's a good place to start.  It is what it is.<//text>

I really like this speakeasy in the back of La Libertad tacos. It's like stepping into a French bar with chandeliers, and toulouse-lautrec drawings, and living trees. It's dark, red lights, and has great drinks. The bartenders always are helpful with great conversation.<//Review>

Great cocktails and very friendly service. Prices are also great (just about every cocktail was $10 or under for good quality alcohol).</text>

<Review>This hidden gem, located in the back of Libertad Tacos and accessed through a large walk-in freezer door, is utterly charming and quite cozy. The lighting, mood and crowd are all pleasing and well matched by the inventive and playful craft cocktail offerings. The Sage Advice in particular is worth the trip. Order tacos on your way through Libertad and they'll bring them right to you. This is an excellent spot to impress a date with your taste and insider knowledge!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Most of the cocktails are pretty amazing, tho I had one I didn't think was all that great.  They are also priced very reasonably for top of the line product.  The entry procedure is fun, and not too well hidden.  The decor is very well done and fun. The only small quibbles I have are not having an integrated way to pay for food from the restaurant in front while having a card held in back for a bar tab, and seating/places to set food plates could be a bit better.  Those are pretty minor quibbles tho.

All in all a pretty cool place, and very good for b-day celebration..</text>< Pics>

If you have craving for hummus and falafel this is your stop. Falafel balls were one of the best I’ve had - very soft and right texture. Hummus bowl with pita bread was beyond expectation. Definitely going back to try it again. I liked the red sauce more than green one. A must try place if you like Mediterranean food. They do have many vegetarian options.< /Text>

<Review>Came here during happy hour (Monday-Friday from 3pm-6pm) and had a great experience. We were seated in the outdoor patio and felt comfortable with the setup. Our server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  Would definitely recommend getting the sampler plate so that you can try a little bit of everything.</Review>< date>

<review>Lot of choices of hummus and pita dishes. I ordered the Hummus Eggplant 🍆 that's so fresh and creamy. There are flavorful chunky eggplant, stewed tomatoes and garlic come with it. They have large outdoor sitting areas and is great for close friends and small family to gather during this pandemics time.</review><user_name>Phil Ye</user_name><Resp>{'time': 1611260661636, 'text': 'Thank you!'}<//Resp></record>

<review>Update: just one mediocre sandwich before. Quality is excellent now.

Old:
Meh. A backup backup when needed. Food quality has deteriorated significantly since COVID began.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
Excellent service, delicious food, reasonably priced with large portions. Recommend the mint tea and the lamb shoulder.

Truly some of the best hummus I've had. I wish they would open a location on the north end of the Peninsula... I'd be there every week! Recommended.< /Review>

< review>
This location is stunning! Floor to ceiling windows, lively atmosphere, cute decor, and great branding. The service was on point and very friendly. It’s been a long time since I had a server tell me their name and offer to tell me about the menu.

Menu consists of traditional and non traditional dishes. I would guess the most popular are the hummus bowls which are a bowl of hummus with toppings. Overall the food was ok. I would say pretty typical but served in a more trendy way. The pita bread was unique. Quite a bit more puffy then normal. It would be nice if the pita was fresh (crispy outside, and soft inside), instead of just kept in a warmer tray all day.

They have a take out section that didn’t have anyone working. The rest of the restaurant is all sit down. Not the typical order at the counter Mediterranean fare. I’ll be back to try again and enjoy the great atmosphere.<//review>

<text>With my husband and friends we love this place. Everything is tasty, fresh and done carefully. The food tastes healthy jeje. Place is beautiful. Service is great, helpful and kind. They have tables in a covered terraza so you can bring your dog. The place is in a little mall sometimes parking is not easy.

<Review>Always love restaurants with high ceilings and this one certainly has.  Bright, clean cut decor felt very comfortable, nice ambience.  The hummus was good, would prefer a bit more chunkier, vs the ultra smooth texture.  The pita wheat bread was fresh, a bit on the thick side.  The falafel was excellent, just the right flavor and texture.  The chicken skewer was tender and the side dishes of eggplant and white cauliflowers were delicious!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808fb59e74490119:0xc50e66148bf29121< /Gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pictures>

<Review>It's just nice to eat at a restaurant and not in your car.  They have outdoor dining.   Took a day off to enjoy happy hour, M-F 3 to 6 pm.   Not really just for the happy hour but sit and enjoy food with another human being.  Food was great.  The beef sandwich with tender beef and great hummus at the bottom.  I had the wonderful falafel.   So yummy.  The baba ganoush was heavenly and smoky.   Their home made pita is like a small pillow.   Great service too.</Review>< Rating>

< Review>
The place looks nice, I liked the design. However, the hummus was just bad, there’s no way to put it nicely. It was very very thick - as if it was prepared a day before and kept in the fridge. The mushrooms were at room temperature and I suspect they were canned mushrooms. The chopped salad was ok but the tomatoes were a little yellow and not ripe enough. The sweet potato fries could have been great had they not been covered by a ton of salt.
The pita bread was great - soft and tasty.</Review>

My family have been here two times in less than a week! This location has better service and seating than the one in Mountain View. And per my daughter the chicken here is more tasty. This place now is our new go to place when we couldn’t decide where to go.
We finally got chance to try their desert, super good!<//review>

This is hands down the best hummus place I have been to! I had initially tried their chopped chicken with Hummus and Pita bread as my lunch meal through work but oh boy, I was left amazed at the quality of food and flavors it had. Hence I decided to explore this place more and ordered something different this time- I tried their  Romanian Eggplant served with a bowl of Hummus and Pita on the side and it was superb! great flavor, good quality and good portion size for their prices. Looking forward to trying out more of their dishes soon!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808fb59e74490119:0xc50e66148bf29121</Gmap_id><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_iajLeww4FngrYQu6lHDGTD9wlpeBDzQ0yVo9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><user_id>115191459158252243116< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Hands-down the best Mediterranean place I've ever been to... probably one of the best restaurants I've ever been to, period. Very considerate and polite service, but the food is where it really shines. Every single item, from the beverages to the entrees, is very simple and elegant, but with overpoweringly  good texture and flavor. Go here for a short, blissful, and filling time, and then further enjoyment from the leftovers.</text>

<Review>Horrible service experience. Waited inline to place a to go order. Was ignored for 8 min then skipped over. Without checking with me to see if I was waiting to place an order, the cashier just assumed I was with the group in front of me since we are all Asians, even though I was standing 6 ft apart from them. The quality of food was alright but the price is high given the quantity.</Review>< Pics>

Oren's Hummus is a fairly new addition to the Cupertino Main Street shopping plaza, and it is definitely a welcome sight. There are plenty of Chinese dining options in the area due to the city it's located in, but Oren's provides a depth to the dining choices in this hip new plaza. My must orders are; Hummus Sabich (great fried eggplant with creamy Hummus all wrapped in a warm and fluffy pita bread), chicken rice bowl (the rice has great flavors and the chicken is tender with great spices), beef kebab (great spices again and it comes with two dips or sides), and sweet potato fries (comes out piping hot with red pepper mayo).
After chowing down on this big meal, I walked out feeling healthy and not weighed down with all the grease found in other restaurants. Oren's provide a fresh alternative to eat healthy while enjoying good ingredients prepared well. I would definitely return to enjoy another "healthy-decision" meal.<//Text>

Was recommended to me as ‘the best hummus you’ve ever had’
False. To be honest, everything except the hummus was good. I had the hummus with chicken liver, delish. But the hummus was in desperate need of flavor, specifically salt. Salt is so important for drawing out the flavors in food, and the hummus here really didn’t taste like much at all unless you added it yourself. They had some yummy sauces on the table that improved it, but I don’t think that it should be left up to the customer to improve the meal. They had great chamomile tea. Pita was alright. Wondering if the Mountain View location is any better.< /Text>

<Text>I love the modern taste of the shop decor. It is clean, chic and inviting. Comparing to the old shop in Palo Alto, it's much more attractive and high end. The food are tasty, just as authentic as the ones I had in Israel. Only complaint is the menu is simpler than the Palo Alto one, so I suspect I missed some dishes here.</Text>< pictures>

I highly recommend the vegetarian sampler - it include 6 different dishes that you can dip into with your pita. However, the sampler doesn't include hummus, so we like to add in a side of hummus and falafel and make it a meal for two!

Tip for Vegetarians: One of the eggplant items in the sampler is made with chicken broth, be sure to ask your server to switch it out with their tomato based vegan option.</text>< gmapID>

<review>I really enjoyed this place.  The food and service were both excellent.  The sampler was a great way to get acquainted with options.  I personality found everything to be yummy.  I also got a chicken salad and tried my hubby's lamb.  Everything was delicious.  They gave me a chocolate mousse for my bday dessert - and it was perfectly decadent.  But my favorite thing was the gluten free pita.  I will be back for that very soon!</review>< pics>

<review>Although high rated, I did not find the authentic Mediterranean taste. More than avg priced. Portion is less for that price. Service is slow, not exactly but still not fast. And funny part is the hot mint tea is just mint leaves and hot water... No tea element it in.. it looks presentable but at the end it's hot water with mint leaves.< /review>< pics>

Nice location, good place to spend an evening. Went there for dinner, we started with mint tea, decent but quite mild. We ordered fries and hummus for starters... the hummus portions are huge but tasted very good. The fries were worse than horrible, too thickly cut and not crisp - we didn't eat more than a couple. For dinner, I ordered pita falafel, my fellow diners got rice plate with veggies, shakshuka and chicken skewers. 3 of the entrees were good and more than made up for the fries 😀. I would liked a bit more tabouleh on my pita but it tasted good anyway so I chomped through it so didn't ask the waiter. My fellow diner didn't like the shakshuka, felt it wasn't done well at all, felt undercooked. The rice bowl and chicken skewers were very good ... 2 of 3 fellow diners cleaned up their plates 👍. Overall good dinner, but don't order the fries for sure.<//text>

<review>Their beef kabob was good, although it felt a bit overcooked but it still tastes good. Their pot of tea is just enough for 2 cups of tea, so can be shared if desired. Hummus is delicious. Their green shakshouka tastes great also. They bring a complimentary side dish of coleslaw (I don't think they call it that but it's what it is).<//review>< Rating>

<text>The hummus here is really good. I ordered chicken skewers with falafel and hummus side with pita bread. The bread here is super fluffy and tastes amazing with the hummus. The chicken is tender and juicy. Falafel is pretty decent too. Tried some of my friend's fried cauliflower and it was also not bad. Her eggplant sauce side left us kind of confused. It didn't taste bad, but it also tasted like the smell of a leather car. You'd think that's a bad thing, but we were just conflicted on what we thought of it. Anyway, the only reason she got that instead of a side of hummus is because she doesn't really like hummus. I love hummus though so I'd definitely recommend it. It is called Oren's hummus for a reason.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn5ahGxhnrlA0BJ-UT0esW820cSwzpV6nahIzj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrDzY2u8a2L2qXNHiPy0f8FM3sM2xTiZCR0GcR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Wine is 50% off on Wednesdays (glass and bottle)!! Service is always attentive, and food is the best and consistent every time. I love all the dips, but especially Oren's Eggplant, Greek-style Eggplant, Labne, marinated beet, and of course the hummus topped with lamb or beef (I have yet to try the chicken liver). They have DA BEST pita bread!! Go for the white pita if you like fluffy bread, and go for the wheat one if you want to be more healthier. What I love about this location is the spacious outdoor area, the perfect place to enjoy some dips and wine with friends or family!</text>

<review>This is the 3rd place Oren is opening in the Silicon Valley. And this one is bigger and fancier. The food is  good Israeli food, slightly adjusted for American taste. Order the humus and enjoy!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3jv6ey0D-7gjctMNCvxO_1LI3jdJKAzn2cPhw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuWUZYbRu-w3LUDWWjFfRQRRzO5zYYng_5zJzv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAMsPZRbb87qqwxAfSBR1O-beX6ZHD5ta6VLhr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Ordered a couple of sides as appetizers. Falafel, Babaganoush, and hummus. Falafel are small bites, these were a touch overdone, but very tasty and not dry. The hummus was creamy and I could taste the sesame, good. The Babaganoush was excellent.
Good service and mid priced.<//review>

<text>THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING 🥰😍 So I wasn't a huge medatrainan fan but this changed the game completely. The pita was the best part and you can ask for warm fresh pita to go and freeze it so it will last you! The hummas is fresh made and one of the best hummas I have ever tasted. All ingredients were fresh and so flavourful. If its just a couple going, I would recommend sharing pitta, hummas, a side and a main dish. It was super filling just sharing and I wouldn't have been able to have my own after the pitta and hummas any way🙂
I have made baklava before but nothing like the way this tasted it was fantastic, I recommend not sharing the baklava though its tiny in portion.<//text>< pics>

<review>I really like the quality of food here. However, beside hummus which is great, they have few entry and drink options. But still really liked the schnitzel and rice bowl.</review>< user>

Love this place! Great sitting area. They have vegetarian option and none vegetarian dishes. I think I got beets hummus with beef. Delicious! Watch out for the white pitta bread, tastes good but can fill up pretty quickly. Park at the large garage next to it. Free public parking. Nice shopping center, you can take a walk and enjoy the view.<//Review>

Great ambiance. You can sit inside or outside in a open and shaded seating area. We had hummus Jaffa style-simple and smooth tasting and the chicken rice bowl. Delicious. The pita, whole wheat bread so soft.< /review>

Great flavor to the Jaffa style hummus.
The beef kebab was flavorful and not too oily. Generous portions as well. Definitely shareable if you're in a small group.< /Text>

I've said it before and I will say it again - hands down the best hummus I've had in my life. Or, as my husband puts it: I always come here thinking 'this time, I will try some of their other menu options - but then... hummus!?' The staff does a great job, the service is prompt even when the place is packed. Also, it has beautiful ambience.< /Review>

Dry rice with exception to some nice people, this place is gradually getting worse every time. Service was not great and the server tried to charge me twice for sides he brought over as compensation for the very bad rice they serve..  isn't that nice? Not a single time that he apologized. It's also not low cost $130 for 3 main courses only for 4 people, with that service? Never again.</Text>

< review>
We tried this place on a Sunday night and it was buzzing with people. First signs that this was going to be a good one. Our waitress took time to explain the menu. We decided to try an order of hummus and a rice bowl with falafel. Both were delicious. The hummus was so creamy and was paired well with a whole wheat pita. The rice bowl was really flavorful. This is must try restaurant if your are around the Cupertino area. They also have branches at Palo Alto and SF.</review>

Food is good and service is right. After a couple lunches there I can say this is a a safe placeace to take a customer for a quick bite or meet friends and catch up on gossip.
So you can actually hear people when they talk! Service personnel is attentive and the menu options are clear and easy to understand.
One star off for lack of excitement on both cuisine and service....I guess we got spoiled with stellar food and people !<//Text>

Waitress was not patient enough to explain our options to us.  The sweet that we wanted wasn't there.  Overall, we did not like the food.</Review>

<review>Unique restaurant with a large selection of hummus bowls and other Greek foods..  I've enjoyed hummus as an appetizer in the past, but I wasn't sure how it would go over as a full meal.  I enjoyed it a lot.  The service was timely and friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed.  Nice change from my normal dining experience.<//review><user_name>Adam Bliven</user_name><GmapID>0x808fb59e74490119:0xc50e66148bf29121< /GmapID><rating>5</rating>< Response>

<Review>Ordered over $100 worth hummus. That’s like 8 plates of Hummus. The order arrived with not a single pita bread. How I’m I suppose to eat all that hummus with no pita. Who ever does the delivery orders is smoking too much and should go cut pickles in the back of the kitchen.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>The first time I went the super friendly waiter recommended the chicken skewer, so I ordered that. It turned out amazing! I chose hummus and Israeli salad as the sides, and both were super tasty. Their pita was very good too!

Highly recommend :) Especially the Cupertino location. It's spacious and has a great atmosphere!<//Review>< user_id>

The food was excellent and the service was good. Also, for an ethnic restaurant it is very friendly as far as ordering and taste is concerned. Kids will likely love the food.

Lastly, the restaurant seemed very clean all around.</Review>

This is my first time taking food in here. I ordered a Rice bowl with Falafel, and I'm writing the review only to that particular dish. Firstly, I'm not at all satisfied with the food.  What bothered me a lot is the quality. The rice is not completely cooked, neither the falafel. I completely disliked the dish and I never ever order  it the other time, from Oren's kitchen. The only thing I liked is the bio based cutlery, which is pretty impressive.< /Review>

Food was bland, no flavor at all. We ordered mushroom hummus and rice bowl with falafals. I was never been so disappointed in mediterranean food before.  How do you mess up hummus? Especially when it's in your name! Just not worth any of it.</text>

I can't believe I never reviewed this place. Absolutely love it!! The food is super fresh and really great. We always order the hummus because we can't do without it. The white pitas are amazing ( our gluten free friends say the gluten free pitas are great).  The appetizers and sides are super yummy. We love the Shakshuka, schnitzel, salads and many other items on the menu. If you like Mediterranean food - this place is a must.
I love their Cupertino location the best. Enjoy!< /review>

<Review>Wow! We went after a day of sight seeing and were amazed at how well prepared and cooked the food was. Got the Jaffa Hummus, Chicken and Vegetable skewers and destroyer them.

If you're looking for a great place to eat in the area, this is a definite MUST.

Service was exceptional and the location is great - good for families, couples, date night etc.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1562187944862, 'text': 'Thank you for the wonderful review and rating Luke! We hope to see you again soon.'}</Resp>< pictures>

Oren's hummus has been a downtown staple for many years. They have consistently have has great food. The hummus options are awesome. My go to is the rice bowl which is fantastic. Don't bother with other downtown Mediterranean places. This is the bomb.<//Text>

This Oren’s Humus is located in Cupertino, California. Forget the Whole Foods humus, or Sabra humus. Oren’s is the real deal. It’s texture, taste and creaminess is heads above any others I’ve had in the United States. It  reminds me of the Israeli humus I’ve had there many times. Plain or topped with olive oil and pine nuts and other spices Oren’s  is the Bay Area’s best.</Text>

<Review>Dearborn and Chicago area has some of the best middle eastern food I have tasted. The first time I tried Oren’s several years ago, it compared equally in authenticity, freshness and variety without being over-priced or Americanized. Their labneh is the freshest I have tasted. The light coleslaw they serve at the beginning, the freshly made pitas, the sampler menu of sides is all I ever need. I can eat their spicy red sauce everyday. Lots of good healthy options for vegetarians.</Review>< Pictures>

The best Hummus ever, perfect consistency & texture. Perfect Falafel, very well balanced mix of vegetables resulting in delicious tasting Falafel.

Absolute best Pita Bread as well<//Text>

However, this place is considerate and skillful enough to use some egg-like substitute to give the gluten-free pita a very tasteful texture (I personally think it even better than the regular pitas). This has totally won my heart! I can tell that this restaurant really takes great lengths to ensure that ALL the customers are happy with the food!

<username>Prof Arun C. Mehta<//username><Review>Had been to Oren’s Hummus and found varieties of stuff being served good but a bit on the higher side. It is spacious as number of guests can sit at a time.  Staff on duty take order and serve food quickly with a smily touch.

Overall a good experience and enjoyed falafel and other items. Its location is prime.

We tend to forget that we live in nearly the most expensive place on earth and our democracy has reached a point where we can and have voted our selves pay raises. These costs must be passed on to the consumer for the business to survive. That said I really like the food and the location is really nice too. Let's hope the mom and pop shops can continue to compete with the big guys.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1523303515225, 'text': "Hello Russ,\nWe are glad you enjoyed your experience at Orens Hummus.  We appreciate your sensitivity to our adjustment in menu pricing.  Over the past year we have seen the minimum wage of the cities we serve increase over 20%. Similarly we have witnessed an increase in employee benefits, as well as the over all cost of goods.  We have tried diligently to absorb as many of these costs as possible without passing them on to the customer.  However, as labor and cost of goods continue to sky rocket in the greater Bay Area we have had little choice but to adjust our pricing as well.\nWe continue to offer all natural proteins, CAFF (California association of family farm) produce and an overall high quality of cuisine in a casually elegant atmosphere.   And while we acknowledge that our pricing has increased we hope that you still consider the service,  cuisine, and overall experience to be a value.\nThank you,\nOren's Management Team"}</Resp>< gmap_id>

Happy this place exists close to home. Servers are friendly and never had to make a reso when I visit (usu after 7:30). So many eggplant options and their pita is amazing. Everything is hearty and seems on the healthier side. Sometimes the meats are a little salty though. Take out usu takes abo 20 mins and never had missing items or mix-ups. Try not to choose seats that face outside when the sun is setting unless you're happy with just seeing the silhouette of your hot (or not) dinner date and squinting your eyes the entire meal. They do have shades that come down and it helps a bit.<//review>

The food here is Great. The restaurant is really pretty inside. Our server was perfect. She went over the whole menu with us after she asked if we'd been there before and none of us had. We ordered the mushroom hummus, lamb hummus, sampler and pickles and olives.   Everything was AMAZING!! None of us have ever had pita so fresh and fluffy. We will definitely be returning.<//review>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Overpriced.
Many entrees, eg chicken/beef skewer with rice, are near $20 (18.50 or 19.50)... So with 4 people you end up with a $100 dinner.
The meat is tasty, however the quantity is not generous, ie you only get one skewer, ... the rest of the ingredients are good quality.
The staff is friendly.
The seating is not comfortable on the booth side (sinks too low in relation to table height).
... I'd expect a dinner like this to be more around $50 than $100.</text>< pictures>

Great food. Best falafel ever. Excellent ambience and service too.

But lame 3% living wage added to bill is low. Common owners.  Pay your staff yourselves and I'll tip them.  Or raise the prices to pay them,  but don't up charge me. Kind of like a Las vegas spa fee at a hotel.<//Text>

< Review>
Came here for dinner earlier tonight. Great food and exceptional service. The staff got one of our orders wrong, but they were quick to fix the situation and even offered the extra food to us on the house with no problem.

They are called a "hummus shop," but they have other full meal options like rice plates and skewer combos . Lots of vegetarian options too!< /Review>

Nice indoor/outdoor vibe although I think I would have preferred a few main dishes with something other than hummus. The mint lemonade was uneventful and mostly for looks. Chicken skewers and pita bread were good and our waiter kept everything flowing smoothly.<//Review>

Fresh ingredients, especially the pita bread, make this restaurant outstanding. Everything is good here. My usual is the basic hummas bowl with a side of falafal balls. The rice bowls are also excellent. The palo alto store has been a goto place for years but the cupertino restaurant is a fun place to hang out as well as eat. The outdoor patio is great for people watching and the interior in nicely decorated with a rustic look.< /text>

When craving for hummas and warm pita bread, this is the place to go!  You can get sampler dishes to share with friends so you are not stuck with the traditional falafel.  Come early or get take out during dinner rush so you don't have to wait.< /Review>

Enjoyed our dinner there.
Had the cauliflower fries which was good and filling.
The Chicken kebab was flavorful.
The vegetarian rice bowl was good except for the eggplant.
Falafel was standard.<//Review>

Oren's is the absolute best! Their hummus and pita surpasses anything in the area for sure, and they of course have stellar vegan options. Friendly, gracious staff and fresh ambience just set it over. Keep doing you, Oren's!</Review>

<Text>Had their chicken pita sandwich. Chicken was really tender. I appreciated that their pickles were mild. Super fluffy pita. A bit pricey ($13), but not terrible considering the quality of food and the location. I think I prefer this to Falafel Stop, foodwise. It's also slightly closer to me, and has much easier parking, much nicer interior, and much more intuitive ordering process.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Oren's hummus has many branches, I have been to one in cupertino downtown. Being vegetarian I tried out hummus masabacha. As the name sounded quite intriguing. It was really delicious and the pita bread was as soft as cotton. Really enjoyed it. I also ordered rice bowl with falafel which I found decent. I was expecting it to be a bit spicy. ( I was craving for biryani before we decided on Mediterranean food). However, my fiance really liked the flavor of the rice.

The place had good ambience and feel. Will definitely go again.<//Review>< Name>

Oren's Hummus Shop reminds me of my mothers cooking. The falafel is spot on. It can't be beat. And their hummus is pretty good too. Definitely recommended. Try out the Chicken Kabobs!</Review>

<Review>We'll probably give it another chance, but the first time did not live up to my hopes. It was about half full on a weekday lunchtime. Two of the items were not as we ordered them, but we just sort of went with it because it was starting to take a long time to get the waiter's attention as the place filled up. The baba ganoush was pretty good. The pita was warm and fluffy. The hummus was not particularly flavorful, but I think I might just need to try more variations of the way they serve it. Passable, not incredible.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

They have all the right things but the quality is so-so.  Burekas are clearly frozen as they arrived cold in the middle.  Hummus is good for the US, but not "Israeli" level.  Some salads were very good.  Falafel was good but not as good as Falafel's Drive In; it also arrived luke-warm (a no-no for falafel).  Beautiful decor.  High prices.</review>

I work nearby so I come here every once in a while to grab the Chicken Schnitzel - great, crispy chicken at a moderate price. I'm sure there are cheaper hummus places near here, and Oren's is one of many in the immediate area competing for the same Mediterranean niche (TKS, Falafel Stop, House of Falafel, etc.) but Oren's has some interesting spins on classic dishes.

I'm a sucker for their coleslaw with how cilantro-heavy and vinegar-y it is - probably a hit or miss for most people.</text>

Food is good but can't be improved.
Humms is nice but place is overpriced.
Maybe it's Cupertino that's why</review>

< review>
The pita is really commendable, freshly baked and real soft! Like fluffy pillow! I tried the chicken skewer platter with babaghanoush and falafel as sides..and my husband tried the  shakshuka! Everything was good. Nothing spicy! The sauces kept on the table, we're good and spicy! The service however was slow.and the prices too high!Pita is the only thing that was worth the money, too small portions for really high prices. Will return to try the Hummus....< /review>

<rating>1</rating><Resp>None</Resp><Name>N M< /Name><Text>*Friend went there, got sick from chicken pita.
*I decided to go there a few days later, ordered chicken pita takeaway,  it was drenched in hommus and salad with very little chicken, thought I had ordered a vegan pita! I expected more given the prices.
*A few nights ago friend and I ordered chicken pitas, same thing, very little chicken but filled with the cheap ingredients.  Both got sick stomach issues for days after, this time we knew it was no coincidence. Oren's chicken made us sick.
*Too pricey
*Won't be going back, ever!

The best thing here is their pita bread and hummus. Their falafel sandwich was so so and the baklava was lousy. Too soggy. Did not try anything else.< /review>

Service is really slow. Great hummus and bread, as well as some veggie dishes such as the green shashuka (cheesy spinach with 2 poached eggs). A must get is the fried cauliflower bites, healthy and tasty.<//text>

We generally like this place. My dish today was a failure, but they can't all be perfect. I'd go back though but will stick to Hummus dishes.</Review>

Great decor, amazing location (main St Cupertino), indoor parking abundant, and amazing food. The flagship Hummus bowl, the Shakshuka, and the falafal sandwich are awesome.< /review>

<Text>I don't know how they do it but Oren's hummus has the best hummus in the bay. Their falafel is mediocre though. I am glad they opened a new location here so I don't have to drive to MV or PA anymore.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>We visited the Cupertino Oren Hummus for the first time. Location wise, it is pretty good. Food wise it is good but as expected, it is on the expensive side. However, the waitress was really nice to us and provided us extra space with an added table. I recommend this place.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

If luckily you have to be served by Pablo, it will be much more pleasant when ordering from the menu, he explains in a subtle way each ingredient that each dish contains and that makes it easier for you to choose.

My favorite was: Romanian Eggplant and pita 🫓
hot mint tea, chicken skewer and Chocolate Mousse dessert.
