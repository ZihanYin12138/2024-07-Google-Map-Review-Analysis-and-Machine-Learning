<review>They have great toys here. I found a brand new Honda Rebel id like to purchase. However,  they only have one sales/finance person and he was busy. No one else knew much of anything.  Kinda frustrating.<//review>< Pics>

My husband worked with Josh Jagoda, he was able to get him a Yamaha Raptor 700R!! He did this when no one else could. He was professional, attentive, and very responsive. Josh is friendly and easy to work with, we will definitely use him for our next sport utility vehicle. Cheers! The Gerharts!<//Review>

<Date>1603581127644</Date><rate>1<//rate><Review>Went in there today to look at generators and quad. First guy behind the counter said he can't help me because he was not a sales license.  That was understandable.  Then the sales guy came. I asked him about 3000 honda generator. He was short and didn't give me an actual price. He said around $2500 to 3k. Well that unit cost around $1500. Then ask if he can look up. He gave me run around.  I asked about quads. Grizzly 700 or Kodiak.  He just shot out high numbers with out checking for me trying to get the sale. I felt like he just wanted me out of there and was trying to scare me with high price.  It was not a race thing.  I am Mexican and he was Asian with sleeved tattoos.  I am a successful general contractor.  He didn't know that because I was not in work clothes.  I usually spend my money locally to help our economy.  Trust me I will never step foot in there again.  I will take my business to Modesto.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<GmapID>0x80914302885df2bf:0x491328f9e79e738a<//GmapID><text>I want to preface this with two things. My reviews and pics on google maps are about 99% positive and they have over 5,000,000 hits. Second, I've purchased/owned over 15 bikes during my lifetime and currently own a BMW K1600 Grand America, which is not an inexpensive bike. I called Merced Powersports looking for a Honda Rebel 300 or 500 for my fiancee who had just passed her bike safety class at the old Castle Air Force Base. This was to be her first motorcycle purchase. I spoke to Jordan who told me they had a 2021 Rebel 500 in black and quoted me $6399. He said he was not in sales so Josh, the sales manager would have to help me when I came in. We arrived at the store and asked for Josh. Josh told us that Jordan should not have quoted because he is not in sales. The price turned out to be a few hundred more than what I was told on the phone. 1st "MISTAKE." After my fiancee was comfortable that she wanted to buy, Josh gave us an out the door price and we asked to start the bike to hear it. Josh said it wasn't set up yet and we could hear after the paperwork. 2nd "MISTAKE." who puts a vehicle on the floor when a customer can't even start it? Next, the first document he produced stated 2020 Rebel 300. I asked  Josh why. He said the factory sent it to him that way and he would have to change it manually. If I had not caught that can you imagine the nightmare when DMV got a hold of it? 3rd "MISTAKE." After completing the paperwork and paying cash, we went to lunch while they set the bike up. Upon delivery, there was ZERO new owner orientation and ZERO warranty explanation. 4th "MISTAKE." I asked about the owners manual and the rest of the books. Josh said they were normally under the seat but he would check. He never checked under the seat which pretty much indicated he knew damn well they weren't there. 5th MISTAKE. He reappeared with a 2020 manual, not a 2021 and no warranty booklet or owner's card which is supposed to be delivered with the new bike. His excuse....that's what the factory sent with the bike. 6th MISTAKE. He obviously thought we were idiots and thought he could just point to the factory for all his issues. At that point I was done. I filed a case with Honda corporate to obtain the books. They referred Josh to me to resolve my case. Josh called me and during the discussion told me that a real motorcycle owner would not care about the year difference in the manuals because the text is the same. To have this kid insult me in that manner (real motorcyclist) on top of all the bulls*&ing he did was unbelievable. I probably owned 5 bikes before he was a twinkle in his Mama's eye. He told me that he would check on getting the correct books and get back to me. that was on Tuesday and I'm writing this on Thursday. Crickets from Merced Powersports. No follow up call to let me know the status...nothing. What an absolutely disappointing first buying experience for my fiancee. I cannot recommend this dealership to anyone. If I dug a little further, I would expect to find out that Josh is related to the owner. That would be the only way he would be able to keep his position after being on the receiving end of his customer service. I guess they have done so much business throughout covid they can blow off customers like this. If the owners are reading this review, please take heed because there is some serious long term damage being done to your dealership. If you don't, that would be the last MISTAKE.< /text><rating>1<//rating><Response>None</Response><name>Rob B.< /name>< Date>

<text>I came in today to Merced PowerSports to ask if they knew where my emissions label was located on my motorcycle. The DMV required it for their inspection. Not only did Jordan give the information to contact and the steps to take. He used his own tools to take apart the rear plastic to find the emissions label. I brought it back over to the DMV and back over to Merced PowerSports and he put the plastic back on free of charge! He just made a life long customer! Thank you for everything Merced PowerSports!</text><Gmap_id>0x80914302885df2bf:0x491328f9e79e738a</Gmap_id></record>

<user>111126771621279291249< /user><Text>I bought a new Yamaha Zuma many years ago and they forgot my owner's manual. It was a cash deal so not that big of deal.
The reason I am commenting is my brother brought the "service" department an engine to rebuild and it was like over a month maybe closer to 2 months and it hadn't even been touched. He talked to the service manager and he said that his mechanic quit. So he asked him if he knows how to work on them and he said yeah. Enough said.
Then I inquired about buying a new motorcycle from them, recieved a text but no
call as the text indicates they will do.
Enough said.< /Text>< date>

The team here (especially manager Chuck and Colin in service) really helped me out with a tire issue I was having while passing through on a long trip.  They went far above and beyond what would be expected from a dealer, solved my problem and not only saved my trip, but possibly my life.  Friendly, down to earth, and really seemed personally invested in me having a safe and enjoyable trip.</review>

Checked on Line for starter motor for my 2001 Rubicon 500 FA.  They found an after market part for half the price which was still about $170.00 less than on line.  Quick ship and I can replace it before the week-end.  Parts guy was very knowledgeable.  Helped that I knew the part, model etc of my ATV.< /Text>

<Review>I was here for emergency tire replacement. The price was very, very reasonable and since I had to hit the road the next day, Merced Powerports managed to get this taken care of the same day. As I write, I'm waiting to get major service done on my bike - the line is long because the service is worth it!< /Review>< pics>

<user>102581217524052785075</user><name>Kevin Vieira</name><date>1448337844348<//date><Rate>1</Rate><review>The guy in parts was knowledgeable and helpful. Don't take your bike in for service though. I dropped it off early(Sept 18) because they suggested it in case there was an opening before my Oct 10 appointment. I asked them to do one of their service packages, balance my back tire, replace my front tire, and replace my front brake spring (i provided a new one). On Oct 20 they told me the back wheel was bad and they would look for a replacement. I found one myself I let them know and they said they would throw it on there the day I bring it in for me. A week after dropping it off, I called to find out the status and they said to come get it. On November 11, I went in paid for the services and was ready to take it home. I then noticed a hole in my seat and a crack on the side cover. They said they'd "make it right," but suggested I go ahead and take it home. They never admitted nor denied they were responsible for the damage. The also never replaced the front brake return spring because the mechanic said the original part was fine. I told him it was not, and explained the issue. He said I was right and tired to quickly put the new spring on. I left it with them because I didn't want to be somehow blamed for the damages. A week and a half later I call in to find out the status and I was told it was ready for pick up, and the young gentleman in service said they fired the mechanic who worked on my bike. I went the next day to pick it up, the seat was re-upholstered but nothing was done about the crack in the side cover. Chuck told me he was not going to cover the side cover because he "spent $75 to fix the seat and I'm not about to pay $300 for a side cover." He then told me it has scratches and cracks all up and down the cover, so he wasn't about to give me a new one. Yes there were scratches, but there were no cracks because I work on the bike myself and I always examine that I put things back right. I took my key and they told me to take my bike, which was squeezed in next to other bikes, so I asked them to move it because I didn't want to knock down any of the other bikes. I got a dirty look from a sales guy, then the mechanic who worked on my bike (who they claimed had been fired) met me outside to move my bike for me. As I drove away, I made it halfway home when the steering stem nut flew off my handlebars. I grabbed it, put it back on, and when I got home, the left handle bar weight fell off. When I put that back on, I noticed the screw to it had been stripped. I will NEVER go back. I had considered buying a new motorcycle from them, but now they will not be an option. I paid for my services, even when the bike wasn't ready to be picked up, I felt like it was up to me to find the parts needed to complete various jobs because my bike is older and they don't make parts for it anymore. Chuck was short and rude when I asked questions and his answers just seemed rehearsed when it came to the damages they caused.<//review>< Pictures>

<Name>linda burks<//Name><user_id>100124155941804256373</user_id><review>After reading the reviews about Merced Power Sports I had second thoughts about taking my Gold Wing Trike to them but I called the service department and was set up with a appointment.Everything went better than I expected. Our trike is a machine of pride, she is a 1993. I was to have the trike at the shop at nine am when they opened but I was there early before the shop opened. As the staff reported to work they walked by us and greeted us and in just a few minutes they were gathering the information needed. I was given a time that they would call me to inform me of the problem with my brakes. They did just as they said, they all treated me and my wife respect and understood how much our trike means to us.We were happy with the entire experience.Thanks to all of the staff. R.

< Review>
avoid them at all cost, they wont listen to you, from picking my bike up, they didn't listen to what i wanted done, and what they did do was take a whole week! 7 days to get the cost of damage back to me, oh but they already ordered all the parts to repair what was damaged on the bike, i told them to call me and tell me what the damage was, and ill decide to repair what i chose i wanted. the forks were twisted a bit, they were telling me its a OPTICAL illusion of the tank not being on straight(the owner and service guy), it didn't ride straight without the handle bars turning right, took it to skips they saw it wasn't straight and repaired it, it sure was straight then (no optical illusion about it). how does such a place maintain customers?...ohh who else is there to go to? well skips is one they earned my business< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Bad service, it looks like a ghost shop, I waited half an hour because I wanted to buy a motorcycle, I saw only two employees who saw me waiting and completely ignored me. I do not indicate!
It is better to go to the city of Modesto where there are other stores of the same type and the service is wonderful

<review>Living in the homes was key to my success with shoreline. They are very structured but also allow a lot of freedom. It taught me accountability and integrity, as well as helped me re learn how to live. They are clean. Clients as well as staff take pride in the homes. I say home and not house because I truly felt at home while living there. I was at Triton house and shout-out to John and Eric for being the best house managers I could’ve asked for.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Incredible program that has taught me how to become a better man and manage my addiction. All of the houses are amazing and well kept. House managers who live at the houses are amazing people who have been through the program themselves and help guide you throughout this whole process. Must work the 12 Steps, attend meetings weekly, and maintain clean house environment which was beneficial to my growth.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Phenomenal experience! Staff is killer and has helped get me on my feet, creating lasting connections even after graduation; best clinical team I have had the pleasure of getting to know! Not only addressed chemical dependency, but also created a greater understanding of mental health and skills to combat and maintain. The structure was much needed for me, setting me up for success in future endeavors as well! Great area for meetings, which a lot of residents as well as staff attend together. So much more I could say about the fruits of their program, so just do it!< /Review>

The shoreline living situations are the best Jin the business! Great homes, great house managers and awesome overall management! I loved my time here as a patient and can never replace the wealth of knowledge, tools and overall love I received here. My sober journey would not be what it is today without the connections I made in with patients and house managers in this particular sober living. If you any to get clean I highly suggest living within the community and getting the most of  what’s being there 24/7 has to offer. When I first signed up I was planning on living at home and commuting but I’m so happy I was convinced to stay in one of the homes. Thank you shoreline for the new life you helped me cultivate. Couldn’t be happier with the results here!< /text>

Had a great experience while staying at shoreline. All the houses are super nice and up to date. Made some really great friends that I would consider my brothers during my stay. I'm very grateful for the opportunity shoreline gave me to get my life back on track. Shoreline is the way to go if your looking for a soberingliving/ iop program<//Review>

This is honestly THE best program in the united States, by a longshot. The staff are the most caring, and they have assisted myself and many other recovering alcoholics with the struggles of earl sobriety as well as gaining the knowledge and skills to succeed in life. 11/10 recommend</text>

<Text>I have struggled to stay sober for a few years now and once landed at Shoreline Sober Living, the quality of this place is unparalleled. If you want to change your life and be held accountable to a world class standard of living, this is it. Residents of Shoreline not only stop the use of drugs and alcohol, they become successful and honest people. 5 stars does not do this place and the culture it facilitates justice.<//Text>< pictures>

They also teach you accountability, communication skills, life skills, nutrition classes, basically how to grow up, start being a man, and useful part of society. The things I am learning on a daily basis is setting me up for success in life as well as my sobriety. They have truly saved my life & showed me what it is to be apart of a family & how to have fun & start living my life to the fullest again. I owe so much to their program & staff which I could never repay but will try to by taking what I have learned there & pay it forward.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Shoreline sober living is by far the best choice I made while doing the program. It’s very structured and has accountability. I learned what it meant to be a normal contributing member of society. I was surrounded by likeminded individuals who were also dealing with the same struggles as I was, which made it easier to share and open up to. The house managers were there for me at all times and had my best interest. I recommend anybody going to shoreline recovery, to go to their sober living as well. It was definitely a positive experience for me!<//Text>

Shorline is a great sober living and IOP program.  I’ve been to a couple different sober livings and Shorline out does them all. The structure and the accountability from all of the staff is what has helped keep me clean and sober. They truly care about every individual that wants to change there life for the better. If your looking for a new way of life along with a real Brotherhood then this is the program to be in.</review>

Good experience overall.  House managers can be difficult sometimes. But when are things ever easy.  Talk to John Menz.  He was super helpful and understanding of my needs.  Great place overall.

My son, Taylor, has been living in the Shoreline Sober Living house on Gardena Road for the last 6 months while he has been a client at Shoreline Recovery Center.  He graduated this week from Shoreline and  has moved to another sober living house in Del Mar.  Enough good cannot be said about the house managers, Mike and Shane.  When Taylor arrived at the house, he was continuing his detox and they both were attentive and focused on his immediate needs.  They set some pretty high expectation for  their clients, but not beyond their reach.  They take a personal interest in making sure that your son is getting what is required for his success. Then to top it all off, Mike and Shane, call the parents on Sundays to update them on the progress their son is making. The program teaches the guys how to work together to achieve a higher purpose.  Their program is very structured, but required to teach responsibility and develop respect for others.  Overall, Taylor said it was the best thing that could have happened to him.
Thanks, Mike and Shane for being there for Taylor when he needed you the most.< /Text>

This was exactly what I needed to help guarantee my sobriety, the guidelines, and rules of the house were tough at times, but that is what you need to face in recovery to be successful in life afterwards, my house managers worked with me on everything being I was a different case than most but they made it work.  They keep a house like a family, everyone looks out for each other and tries to help the new guys learn the ropes!</review>

I could write a long review about all the amazing people at shoreline. I could go on and on about the beautiful homes and their perpetual state of cleanliness. I could talk about the structure and how necessary it was to my recovery. Instead I’ll just say that Shoreline not only kept me clean and sober, they taught me how to stay sober. Its hard for me to express how grateful I am for that opportunity. The people here genuinely want the best for you and will do everything they can to help. I just hope I can help the next guy.

It isn’t easy, but it’s exactly what I needed and I am so very thankful for that. Just keep moving, it gets easier every day.< /Review>

<time>1569351579058</time><rate>5<//rate><text>Shoreline sober living is excellent in balancing the need to provide structure and tailor to the specifics of their clients needs.  It is run in tandem with the recovery center, and the sober living component is essential for clients to build accountability and consistency in their daily behaviors.

All the houses are incredibly clean, and they are centrally located in a flourishing sober community that has dozens of weekly meetings.  Additionally the surrounding community of Encinitas was crucial to my recovery, providing opportunities for critical self care activities such as meditation, yoga, surfing, hiking, and rock climbing.< /text>< pics>

Amazing location with beautiful houses. House managers have all gone through shoreline themselves and are always willing to help. Assisted me with structure and time
Management as well as develop a bond with other men fighting for their recovery. Great experience.< /Review>

<text>This place saved my life!!
I was living in the back of my van and couldn’t stop drinking and gambling.
The staff is courteous, caring and devoted to helping addicts who are down and out. I spent three months there and learned so much about myself.
My house managers Ryan Ward and Noble White taught me how to be kind patient and discipline myself to a become the man that I am today. I went through the steps and and got my confidence back.
Today I have a relationship with both of my daughters and I reconnected with my oldest daughter who I hadn’t seen or spoken to in over six years.
I could never repay this debt and Shoreline was the last saving grace for me.
Anyone who has a drug, alcohol and gambling problem should definitely give Craig or Robert a call.
The program director Kate is amazing also. She got me through some of the toughest times in my life with therapy and never judged me.
This isn’t just a recovery center. They are my extended family and even though I live 2 hours away I still drive down to see my brothers on occasion.
Thank you Shoreline for giving me back my life!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I've had the pleasure of being best friends with many of the young men that have gone through Shoreline's Program & Sober Living. It's no coincidence that I found such a solid group of guys to be friends with and they all were taught the principles of recovery and life itself from Shoreline. Each of them have flourished into trustworthy, kind, respectable men that are prime examples of what anyone can have in sobriety if they are willing and take the next indicated step. I can honestly say that Shoreline has provided each of them with the tools in order to not only stay sober and handle life on life's terms, but to succeed at it. Shoreline is a huge advocate for learning how to get acquainted in the recovery community, manage finances, build a strong sober network, have a job, work on relationships, etc. I would highly recommend Shoreline to anyone in need of guidance, structure, and accountability in recovery!< /Review><GmapID>0x80dc0c127ecefc93:0x77b2cd59dc85c6f9</GmapID>< userid>

Shoreline Sober Living a quality place to start the journey of Recovery.  The owner provides a very comfortable and appealing atmosphere.  He upholds to the standards of the San Diego Sober Living Coalition and since the homes inception has thrived based on his stellar reputation.  He has helped me build my business and we have been fortunate to chat about Sober Livings and our programs.  His home is located in a fabulous neighborhood where meetings and Recovery events are within close proximity.  I have seen him go above and beyond with creating his own Sober events, so that his residents can learn that sobriety can be fun and you can make new friends along the way.  I respect Robert and hold him in high regard.  Bother personally and professionally.<//review>

<Review>Shoreline sober living  provided me with the tools I needed to stay sober after I got out of rehab. I didn't know how to live my life sober and they provided me with everything I needed to succeed and be able to live a normal lifestyle. They've helped out many people and are serious about getting you the help you need if you're willing to put in the work it takes to stay sober. Going past 2 and a half years clean and I'm still grateful for the experience that I've been given from all the people who manage as well as live there.<//Review>< Pictures>

I would like to write a little bit about my experience at Shoreline Sober Living San Diego. From the moment that I walked into this sober living home I felt comfortable and at peace. The home smelled good and was clean unlike any home I have seen before. I have lived in several sober homes in San Diego but none like this one. The guys that live here are caring towards one another and treat each other respectfully. What I also really loved about this home was the structure to the home that each of the residents participates in. I feel blessed to have been able to spend as much time with these guys at this home and they really helped me in my recovery. I am coming up on two years of continuous sobriety now.< /review>

<review>Wow. There is so much to say about Shoreline Sober Living. The location and quality of the houses speak for them selves but what happens inside the house is priceless. Not only are they welcoming but as a new guy, you are the top priority of the house. Getting you accustomed to the way the house runs and into the sober community. The structure can be hard at first, but absolutely necessary for success. The comraderi and brotherly love that this place influences is something you can't find anywhere else. Shoreline sober living is apart from other places because they guide you to become a man. A man of his word, a friend, a leader. This place gave me so much I could talk about it forever. I've tried to get sober over and over the last 9 years, but it wasn't until shoreline was when I was given the tools and direction to succeed. I spent 14 months there and am grateful for every second. This place changed my life, saved it as a matter of fact, and for that I'm truly grateful. I would recommend this place to anyone!<//review><rate>5</rate><Name>Justin Corbisez</Name><date>1496470766876<//date><gmapID>0x80dc0c127ecefc93:0x77b2cd59dc85c6f9</gmapID><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>107032437212200723727<//user_id>< resp>

<Text>Shoreline was hands down the best decision I made when beginning the process of recovery. All of the staff were friendly,  relatable, and professional. Shoreline's comprehensive plan was exactly what I needed to regain the trust of my family and friends as well as it taught me how to live as an independent adult. Cannot speak highly enough of this place. Robert (owner) continued to follow up with my parents and myself to see how I was doing even when (at the time) it wasn't looking like I was even going to attend their program. Speaks volumes to how much they really care.<//Text>< Response>

<Text>It's difficult for me to put into words the level of gratitude I have for this place and the individuals involved. Prior to coming to Shoreline, I had been to treatment 6 times and countless sober livings all over southern California. The staff involvement, the structure of the house/ commitments, and the camaraderie far exceed that of any sober living I've ever resided at. Most importantly, Shoreline taught me how to take responsibility for my actions and remain accountable to my fellows. In essence, it taught me how to be a man; a man in recovery.</Text>< Pictures>

He wants to give each of the guys who come to Shoreline the best opportunity for a new life. I have been around the sober living community for four years now and have worked with other homes as well. I can say that this is one of the best. This assessment is based on location, cleanliness of the home, heart of the owner and the program provided.

<text>Shoreline changed my life forever and I am grateful to be a part of such a close fellowship & structured program. If something inside is telling you that you need help, then definitely consider Shoreline. Their staff is comprised of addicts/alcoholics just like yourself whose goal is to pave you a road to freedom and happiness. Just be mindful that there are rules, chores, and guides lines to follow— but I’ll tell you what, all of those things shaped me to be a better human being in the end.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Shoreline was exactly what I needed at a very pivotal time if my life. My addiction had driven me to the end of my wits and stolen everything from my life. The staff here is amazing everyone from kate down to the house managers will not give up on you no matter how bad you want to give up on your self. This program didnt give me my life back it gave me a life I love today. The men i lived with are my brothers today and the peer accountability this program has works you cant fly under the radar here this program is for people who want it and if you want it oh my god man is it worth it. I was a broke. Scared and lost little bit when I came to shoreline but after the 6 months I spent working on myself with their help I became a man I owe my life to this program and would highly recommend it.< /review>< Date>

I learned to take responsibility for my actions and attitude and to be present and accountable.  It worked in synchronization with its namesake Shoreline Recovery Center - with the leaders of the sober living coordinating, meeting with and sharing with the counselors, therapist and experts at the recovery center to offer each person the kind of well planned strategy for recovery.  The fellowship of the sober living residents is the stuff of deep long lasting relationships.  The managers have all completed the program.  They know what is needed to change someone who is entitled, disillusioned or depressed with their life and require action of their residents to effect such change.  As far as I’m concerned they’ve got the perfect model of what can work when someone is ready.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Shoreline Sober Living was the perfect transition from the 30 day treatment center for our son, it was the answer to our prayers.  The house is run with a very regimented daily routine to keep all clients on track and give them the best chance for success in recovery, treating the mind, body and soul.  Our son has been sober for almost two years now and has been very successful in all aspects of life and employment. None of us knows what the future brings but we are very confident our son has the knowledge and skills to stay on the path he is choosing and where to turn when in need for strength.  He is taking it on day at a time and responsible for himself. For our family we couldn't ask for anything more and Shoreline Sober Living was
absolutely a key piece to puzzle of putting a life back together.  We again thank and ask God to bless Robert and the staff at Shoreline Living.< /Review>

<Review>As we write this review of Shoreline Sober Living, our son, just this past week, celebrated his first year of sobriety.  This milestone was achieved through a combination of hard work, commitment and courage that was fostered by the unwavering support of Shoreline's management team.  Over the course of the past year, we've had weekly communication with the house manager that served as a much needed bridge to our son and his progress.  The unfamiliar territory of his recovery was made far less daunting by Shoreline's expertise, compassion and desire to support the entire family unit.  We are eternally grateful for all they have done for us and continue to do for others.  It is an honor and a privilege to write this review on behalf of Robert Wilson and Aaron Harmon.< /Review>< pictures>

Shoreline helped me save my life. I could not get or stay sober. I have been to 10 different sober livings across 4 different states and Shoreline is on a whole other level. I was encouraged to take action and take responsibility for my life in a safe space. They helped me tackle the long standing problems my drug addiction caused. Issues with old behavior, finances, relationships... all were addressed with the help of peer accountability and mentorship of management. I met sober life long friends here. Everyone involved with this program just wants to see people get better. I am finally able to live my life, and this place helped me lay the foundation.</Text>

<Text>I am a former resident at shoreline sober living and I have to say that it absolutely was the most vital element of my recovery and treatment. The support and fellowship that I found at Shoreline was overwhelming and has helped me build strong friendships that I still have to this day. Ultimately I was a completely renovated person after my stay at shoreline due to the serene atmosphere and level of accountability I was encouraged to apply to my day to day living. Plus being in the San Diego area provides beautiful weather all year long and leaves little for one to complain about. All in all Shoreline sober living provided me with the guidance, hope, resources and strength that I needed to build a new and happier life that I still enjoy today!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< review>
I own and operate a nearby intensive outpatient treatment program called True North Recovery Services.  One the years as an outpatient provider you get to know what other entities are doing through a pretty diverse sampling of their clients.  We have often shared clients with Rob and the staff at Shoreline.

Rob runs a tight ship at Shoreline and maintains a steady structure that everyone can grow familiar with.  We find that the safety of this also helps these clients in their therapy.  Sometimes they need to test the structure in order to feel safe.  Once they do they are magically able to open up in their therapy sessions.  They just needed a safe container to live in where they had support, accountability, and camaraderie.  Rob and the crew at Shoreline are doing an excellent job of providing this to all of them.  We hope they continue to do this for many years to come.<//review>

I was a resident at Shoreline for 14 months and it helped save my life. After leaving my treatment center I was referred to Shoreline by a friend.  Combined with AA, Shoreline taught me life lessons I was never taught: accountability, responsibility, how to be of service to other people, and how to live a happy life on life’s terms.  Robert Wilson was very helpful and accommodating.  There is no other sober living home in San Diego like, the homes are kept very clean and the location can’t be beat. If you want to learn to become a successful man in recovery I highly recommend Shoreline.</Text>

After attending an in-patient facility on the east coast, I was told about Shoreline and contacted the owner Robert.  He was super helpful, worked with my family, and arranged for me to enter their program the day following my discharge from treatment.  Shoreline operates two beautiful houses near the heart of Encinitas and the management, headed by Robert and house managers Andy and Aaron, work hard to cultivate a positive living situation that encourages accountability, service, and progress -- all important factors in early recovery.  Shoreline creates a very healthy balance of freedom and responsibility that allows the residents to create a solid foundation for their recovery while establishing themselves as independent and functioning members of society.  Their location just north of San Diego is in the middle of a large, vibrant, and active recovery community.  I recently celebrated one year of sobriety and my time spent at Shoreline was instrumental to getting where I am today and hope to go in the future.  I would highly recommend Shoreline to anyone in need of a positive, healthy environment in which to forge their new lives in recovery.  Many, many thanks to Robert, Aaron, and Andy  --  you guys are the best!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I've struggled with drug and alcohol addiction most of my life. I didn't know why, I just knew I could not stop no matter how hard I tried. When i moved to San diego for treatment it was the farthest thing I knew from home. The day i checked into Shoreline Sober Living San Diego I immediately felt at peace, no longer homesick. This home gave me access to and outlined for me a program of recovery that for the first time in my life allowed me to get and stay sober. Along with being sober came happiness. Happiness and sobriety, two things I never thought possible at the same time. Shoreline Sober Living San Diego provided for me structure and accountability that I've never received anywhere else. After many years of searching I was finally provided an answer which was shown to me in the twelve steps of alcoholics anonymous. For the first time in my life I feel free, happy and content with just being me. I cannot say enough good things about this place. It literally saved my life.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Beautiful home. Amazing location on the coast of Encinitas. This area has a great sober community and living here is an awesome place for anyone looking for a lifestyle change. Definitely not you're average sober house, this place has all the amenities. Truly an opportunity of a lifetime for people new in recovery. From the owner to the managers these guys know what they are doing! They really care about the people in the house and the community. Sobriety can be be a challenge and having the structure and support of a house like this makes it that much easier. I have a lot of experience's with halfway homes, extended care and sober living and this place is top of the line in all aspects, which in my opinion is few and far between. Being surrounded by like minded people as well as receiving support from people in recovery is key to getting back on your feet and I can't think of a better place to do it.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc0c127ecefc93:0x77b2cd59dc85c6f9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>These guys are really passionate about helping others further their recovery.  I have visited many different San Diego sober living homes as I have a loved one that has been struggling for many years.  This sober living home is unlike all of the others we have visited.  The managers here offer structure and accountability for these men and are very compassionate.  I'm so glad we found Shoreline Sober Living.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

So a quick review on my experience at Shoreline Sober Living in Beautiful San Diego, California.  I lived at Shoreline Sober Living for a total of 14 months.  In that time period I learned a lot about myself and how to live life sober and as a functional member of society.  Without Shoreline Sober Living my recovery would not have been possible.  When I came to Shoreline Sober Living from New Jersey I had no idea what I was getting myself into, not knowing a single person in San Diego. Shoreline introduced me to an amazing recovery support system. Without this support system I would likely be dead or homeless.  I am forever grateful for every experience that has taken place during those 14 months.  Even after moving out of Shoreline Sober Living I return frequently to see all the guys and update them on how I am doing.  I now work two jobs, see my son on a regular basis, my family wants me around again, and I am the happiest most productive person I can be. Once again none of what I just mentioned would have been possible without the guidance and love that I received  from Shoreline Sober Living.  I would recommend this house to anyone who seriously wants to get sober.< /Text>

I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful setting to get sober in!  Shoreline Sober Living is located in the perfect location in San Diego County-Encinitas.  Fortunately, for every guy that decides to give this sober living a shot, Shoreline offers so much more that just beautiful location and beautiful houses.

The structure of the program has been designed to give men like me the tools to stand on our own and transition back into life.  I learned a lot about accountability, responsibility, and brotherhood in my time living there.  The environment promotes building strength from within and building community and connection between guys.

Paired with IOP at Shoreline Treatment Center, the model is unlike any other that I have experienced.  The structure was much needed in my life but didn't take away from learning how to have fun again, either.  The reputation for being one of the best sober living programs in the area, if not the best, is well deserved.  I'm living proof, along with all the other alumni of the program, of the powerful healing that happens here.< /text>

If you want to change your life and be held accountable to a world class standard of living, this is it. Residents of shoreline not only stop the use of drugs and alcohol, they become successful and honest people. 5 stars does not do this place and the culture they facilitate justice.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I cannot describe the amount of support my son received at Shoreline from Robert Wilson and Kate Judd.  Although it was determined that Aaron was not ready for outpatient or sober living Kate Judd was very involved in helping us make a decision on a wonderful
120 day residential program.   We do not have resources in Missouri for the type of care Aaron needs and we are so grateful for the support of the recovery community at Shoreline and in the San Diego area.  Thank you!  Jenni Lenz< /Review>

Before I came here I tried every which way to get clean, and failed. They're system works and I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with addiction. Been able to put together a year plus of clean time, get and hold down a job, have my family back and most importantly live a great life without drugs. Thank you shoreline for everything you do.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Let me start by saying that this home and the program that these men run is truly bringing a breath of fresh air to the San Diego Sober Living community.  Shoreline Sober Living is much more than a place to live and be sober.  I was immediately able to tell that the management team at this facility is invested in making sure that each resident is given the best possible opportunity at achieving permanent sobriety. Having personally experienced three different treatment centers and two other sober living homes I can say Shoreline is a one of a kind.  Shoreline Sober Living provides superior amenities and structure that are a necessity to be successful in sobriety.  The spirit that this home contains is inexplicable and helps create relationships that will catapult you into a new and healthy support group and way of living.  When you have been to and visited as many sober living homes, treatment centers and outpatient programs as I have you can start to see the difference between ones that are run by those just looking to take your money and those that place the quality of the homes recovery first.  If you take the opportunity to come tour this sober living home and meet the community here you will see how genuinely caring these men are.  I was able to easily walk to the beach and the gym from this sober living home and they provided surfboards for residents and did outings like camping trips, ping pong tournaments, paintballing, snowboarding and fishing.  What kind of sober living home does that!?!?  The home is brand new and really big and it is always spotless clean.  All of the men attend daily 12 step meetings and the most important part is that they attend TOGETHER.  Anyone that has attempted sobriety knows that you can't do this alone.  I have seen so many struggling men come through this home and achieve long term sobriety that I wouldn't recommend anywhere else. Thank you to Shoreline Sober Living and those who run it!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>Shoreline provided me an ideal environment to heal and then the motivation to thrive. The program is centered around community, and personal growth; they take things a step further and help their clients become financially responsible and explore ways to achieve their passions in a healthy way.

I have yet to meet a person whose desire to help those struggling with addiction is more passionate than Robert Wilson's (owner & CEO). When faced with the choice between what is best for a client and money, there is never a hesitation... people are always first. This is the primary reason I chose Shoreline. I view my time at Shoreline as one of the most valuable and enjoyable experiences of my life. If you want real change, this is the place to find it.< /Review><date>1525988630618</date></record>

I had an opportunity to meet some of the staff of this men's sober living at a networking event and it was a breath of fresh air to meet people as passionate about their line of work as I am. As a yoga instructor I deeply care about the health and well being of all of my clients and it is obvious  that the staff at this sober living whole heartedly cares about the improvement of their clients quality of life as well. For anyone considering this house as an option  I highly encourage you to reach out to them and you will see for yourself that their number one goal is to help others. The beautiful location and like minded community doesn't hurt either.<//text>

Shoreline sober living provided me the guidance, support and structure I needed in early recovery.  After completing treatment, my counselors strongly advised that I attend Shoreline sober living.  Now, after several years of sobriety, I am grateful that I followed that recommendation. My time at Shoreline was the single greatest contributing factor in my path to becoming a highly productive, sober member of society.  I now work in recovery as counselor, which has given me an insider’s perspective on how Shoreline compares to other sober living programs, and as a result, my appreciation for this program has only grown. The structure of Shoreline’s program is not like any other you will find in the area. What separates Shoreline from other homes is the culture of comradery, and even more importantly, the level of accountability. Upon entering Shoreline I was accepted with open arms and the residents integrated me into the community quickly- showing me the ins and outs of the daily routines, the best meetings to attend and setting me up with a solid sponsor.  I was also introduced by my fellow residents to many people in the recovery community outside of Shoreline that I now consider friends. I saw this process repeated with each new resident.  Looking back now, I realize how imperative this experience was to my recovery.  Finding and becoming part of a sober community is of paramount importance and Shoreline facilitates this experience in a way that other recovery homes don’t. Aaron, the Program Manager, does a great job of fostering a positive atmosphere while stressing the importance of a balanced life that includes work, fellowship, commitment, goal setting, financial responsibility and community.  The entire staff, from the top down, genuinely care about helping each resident find success in sobriety and they work closely with each resident to assist in the transition from treatment back into the stream of life. Shoreline’s location couldn’t be better since Encinitas is home to an active, robust recovery community.  The houses are centrally located and close to the beach. There is plenty of opportunity for employment in the surrounding area and the houses are walking distance to the gym and shopping centers.  The houses themselves are immaculate and kept clean. I am eternally grateful for the experience I received at Shoreline, and highly recommend this program to anyone looking to find lasting recovery.<//text>

<user>104281409895334145405<//user><review>I just wanted to say I'm super grateful for this recovery home for helping out so many struggling young men. Opiate addiction destroys lives and literally kills 150 Americans every day. My ex boy friend had been struggling for years with meth and heroine and is a chronic relapser who's ego would not let him gain the social skills and work ethic he needed to keep healthy relationships and a job. This recovery home gives men like my ex the opportunity to integrate into society with confidence they need to know they don't need to rely on drugs and ego to keep them afloat. At shoreline the residents become actively involved in a recovery program while they learn to work through personal issues keeping them from maturing and participating in the community. I'm so grateful for the folks at shoreline for their wonderful sweet care and vast experience with addicts of all ages. Thank you.< /review>< Rate>

<review>Our son is in his third year of recovery.  We attribute much of his success in now being free from not only drugs but also alcohol and tobacco to the support, care and guidance he received at Shoreline and from its management team. Following a lengthy, 120 day stay at a local San Diego County inpatient treatment facility, he stayed at Shoreline for over a year and since then has maintained contact with the community.  Throughout his stay we were most appreciative of Shoreline's continual weekly progress calls, advice, expertise on addiction and desire to help not only our son, but also all of our family navigate the difficulties that arise throughout the different stages of getting free of intoxicating substances. During his three prior unsuccessful attempts to become free of drug use at nationally known inpatient treatment centers, we never fully understood, nor was there much attempt made by those facilities to make us aware of the critical role a sober living facility and ongoing outpatient treatment provides in achieving lasting recovery. Thirty days of inpatient treatment followed by nothing more than AA meetings and good intentions was a recipe for relapse. During his last in-patient recovery at a well known facility here in San Diego County, they stressed both the need for at least 90 days of in-patient treatment and for an extended period of transition with outpatient treatment while living in a structured sober living facility where continued sobriety is bolstered through ongoing testing, experienced staff and and a community of peers who are also seeking lasting recovery.  Shoreline Sober Living is such a facility. We are extremely grateful for all they have done for our son and us.< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< Time>

My best friend was a hope to die drug addict. We all feared for his life and watched him live homeless and miserable for years. After finding about shoreline sober living we got him in. He now has turned his life over and his family is back in his life. Now every Sunday we see him at church and are so thankful that God has put a place where addicts and alcoholics can have a new chance at life.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>As a former client of Shoreline Sober Living, I was very pleased with going through the program and interacting with the staff. During my active addiction, life was falling apart at every seam and filled with negativity, doubt, hatred. The awesome part of the Shoreline program was that once I got sober, I learned how to live sober. I was taught how to take care of things like chores, keeping my possessions organized, being accountable to not only myself, but people around, and building trustworthy relationships. I learned how to take care of the little things so that when it was time for the big things, I wouldn't get overwhelmed and be prepared to handle whatever life throws my way.  Almost reaching a year clean and it's all thanks to this program.

Shoreline sober living is a men's house that varys in age. It is located in San Diego California. It is by far the best sober living in San Diego county due to their structure. I have a few close friends that went threw that house and they came out as completely different people. Why because they focus on alot of the uncomfortable things that us as alcoholics have to go threw in order to stay sober long term. That's the difference between shoreline sober living and all the other sober livings in San Diego,  accountability is a key factor there, it's so nice to see a place that actually cares about all the residents. They show up for them and there family's threw the hard difficult time. Its houses like this that make a tremendous difference in the world and in people's lives. THANK YOU!</Text>

<Review>Had an hour to kill before a meeting in Colusa CA.  Noticed Birrieria Michoaca and pulled in to have a coffee and light breakfast.  It was early in the morning and I was the first customer.  Chairs were still up on tables and the waitress was cleaning.  She stopped and took my order - Chorizo and eggs with beans and rice.  So much for my light breakfast.  The food was excellent.  They do something different with the beans.  They were very good.  I have to say the coffee was very average, maybe even instant. If I am ever in town again I will go back for a lunch or dinner.</Review>< resp>

By far the best place I’ve been to, customer service is excellent. Food has a unique flavor that you can’t find at any other restaurant, it makes you crave their food. My number one spot I’d pick 100 times over!</Text>

Stopped here for lunch while passing through Colusa. Very good wet burrito and wife had very good taco salad. Popular local spot and everybody knows each other. Fast service was very good too. Some parking for large rigs. We found a spot while towing our 30' trailer and another semi was parked there too.<//review>

This is my opinion only. I cannot recommend this restaurant. The lady waitress was rude Frozen enchiladas taste better then the ones I ate there. You're better off stopping at Jeff's hamburger stand or the casino to eat.<//Review>

<Review>Great little corner coffee shop. Great for a mid-morning pick me up or a quick bite to eat. Service is good and quick. It's usually filled with students, but if you can get a window table you have a wonderful view of Geary while sipping on your latte.<//Review>< pics>

Loved this family coffee shop!  We found it by accident-finding street parking.  My double cappuccino was excellent-not too sweet!  The regular coffee there was better than the chain coffee shops nearby!  The poppyseed muffin was fresh & moist.  Service was excellent!  It was not busy-lots of places to sit and enjoy the atmosphere.  What a nice find in the big city!<//text>

I enjoyed the atmosphere here and the nice staff. Great cup of coffee, only 3 stars because we ordered gluten-free peanut butter cookies but unfortunately it was hard like a rock. Not sure if gluten free cookies are hard always but this one for sure was way to hard to enjoy.< /Review>

I was driving around Geary trying to find a place to study when I found this place. Their coffee is good; about average prices.

Lots of seating and open room so it's not too crowded. It's also nicely decorated.

They also have free wi-fi which is always a plus. I haven't tried their food but the panini sandwiches looked yummy.

Overall, good place to study or to just hang out and chat with friends.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Here in this place. does not serve bread. I had a bad experience I went only once and I will never return the old bread! Without flavor and very greasy and expensive !. Nothing cool. Demand better quality!

I lived in bellflower, in downey and now LA .... there was a confusion today with the bread that keria conchitas and they gave me shells, I just turned around and told Mrs. ... that I did not want to change, explain to her She could see that I didn't do anything to her and I didn't want to change them .... well bad she said ps if you want to bring more money and you give more ... I was at the door that my daughter asked and in the car she had the baby I was asleep so I could not enter the bakery and leave alone or send my daughter alone ..... anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️

This rating is for my mail carrier.  I do not get all my mail.  I get other neighbors mail.  It’s a daily occurrence.   EDD said it my debit card was mailed two weeks ago. I have yet to receive it. I don’t know if it’s floating around the neighborhood or what.  It’s very frustrating not being able to depend on the USPS.<//text>

<Text>I have always received courteous service Everytime I come to this post office. I have never had an issue that wasn't easily solved. The only concern I have is for the inpatient customers that believe they deserve some special treatment because they are in a hurry and don't realize that sometimes sending packages can take some time. Every clerk that has helped me here has given me 110% of there time and effort. I appreciate them greatly.<//Text>< Pics>

This post office is a wonderful place to do business. The staff are always friendly and courteous and responsive. The best feature is that the post office staff are ready and able to explain mailing options and help correct my (several) mailing faux pas. Great post office! My only complaint is that the do-it-yourself parcel service in the lobby doesn't give media mailing rates, so I must see a person to secure that postage. Overall, though, a five-star operation.<//Review>

My mailman is terrible, older Asian guy. Will no longer be using Usps in Novato, CA. His truck number is 1260712. Refused to deliver package with signature confirmation yesterday and today. After I confronted him today asking where my redelivery was, he said he didn’t want to bring it. I said you don’t knock? He said I did. More lies! I was home both days and could hear his truck pull up but not his mystery knock? He argued with everything I said, when I rehearsed Usps policy on Signature Conformation deliveries he continued to lie. Terrible service<//review>

<Text>I just had the most pleasant experience at this post office. Staff was friendly and courteous to everyone. They loaned pens and tape as needed. They explained options. Three windows were open, and as soon as a line formed, someone came out from the back to ask if anyone had something quick, like pickup, dropoff, or just buy stamps. It was among the most pleasant experiences I ever had in a post office. People love to complain about post offices for some reason, but I value the tremendous service they provide. I was shocked to read the negative reviews of the staff here and I think they were grossly unfair.< /Text>< UserId.>

<review>Wanted to make an appointment for passport renewal. Called the number listed to no avail. It just rings. Pathetic. Would have given zero star if that was an option.

Update: I'd like to add that ONCE you walk in and make an appointment, then the experience is much more pleasant! I must admit that the lady who helped me was wonderful! Just don't try to make an appointment by phone!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Better hope you never have to call these people on the phone, or do a PMB that is not THEIR PO Box, or a simple forward, because you might as well just get in the car and drive however many hours it is to get there.  They don't answer phones, they don't have email addresses listed on their site.  Overall, if you think old men look cute in their title outfits, they got that going for them, outside that, dinosaurs will die.</text>

<Review>These people don't care and have no reason to care. They are protected and and level of service or the lack there of, is acceptable. Bottom line,  I don't care what you think, because you can't touch me or my job. #Privatize USPS< /Review>< gmapID>

<time>1463169601517<//time><Review>Used their Kiosk in the lobby to send a package and received the package back short postage.  If their scale was incorrect why send back the package and delay shipment due to their own error. Very Frustrating! O.K. I'm editing this.  Apparently an envelope is not necessarily an envelope depends on how thick the envelope is, too thick becomes a package.  Still 2 stars because the wait is ridiculous. Customer Service is nice but Management, get them more help!  One person and a line of 20 is not O.K.! Third in line and it took over 20 min. to be helped! Customers behind me, who knows!</Review><user>111807456318256784162</user>< Name>

<Date>1485631888712</Date><text>Terrible.  The phone number listed just rings and rings.  No one ever picks up.  Sometimes you're lucky enough to hear a fax scream like they switched the phones over to fax. The lines are long and the lobby help is very slow. They act as if they truly don't care at all.  Maybe because they truly don't.<//text>< rating>

< Review>
Very unhappy with them!  they lost a very important package amounting to  almost $1000 of clothing destined to my daughter's new job in Connecticut.  The package was never delivered.  I traced and hounded the post office for days as to its whereabouts.  Finally was able to talk to a gentleman who offered to loo into it.  It had gotten "stuck" for 3 weeks in one of the southern California PO depots.  Package arrived at its destination three weeks later, with all the contents missing and replaced with random garbage.  I pursued all the official trails for reimbursement. The local office informed me that "this happens all the time." and that they would deal with it. They acknowledged the theft on their watch, but never resolved any of the problem, nor were the required insurance monies due to my daughter ever sent.  In spite of writing many letters and tracking down the post master general, not even the $50 they offered by policy was refunded!!!!

Other times, Big package was delivered on top of my country mailbox, making it obvious for a thief to steal it.  Emptied box was later found in a bush by a neighbor down the street.

Recently a bill was not picked up from my box.  No mention was made as to why it wasn't picked up.  Left it for two more days.  It was picked up and returned with "extra postage needed."  I had inadvertently placed an older 42cent stamp on the envelope.  I returned it with an additional 5cents yesterday, only to have it returned to my box today without any explanation.  My bill will now be late and I obviously will be making another trip to the post office, since they never pick up their phones.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>All around, awful deserve black stars. The self serve machine in the lobby constantly has issues, such a no paper to print out postage, or is jammed.

Could the staff move any more slowly?????....They will only go back and get one package at a time, disappear for 15 minutes, but are always trying to sell you something.

Mail carrier...my mail goes someplace else, while I get other peoples. They deliver mail and do not pick up letters pinned to the mailbox to go out.

I had two packages that I needed to go down and pick up and I would be out of town. I went on the website, stated I would pick them up in a couple of days. I get a call, they leave a voice mail saying I would need to be at home to get the packages...I work full time in Corte Madera, so not possible. The person leaves no name and no phone number to call back. I call the 898-8799 and it rings over a dozen times...then rings for at least 5 more before someone picks up and I point out that they completely misread the message on the website. I have also had them lose packages that I went to pick up as well. A complete disaster.</Text>< pics>

Not sure why we aren't receiving our mail.  4 letters mailed by family for a birthday, that still have not arrived since 6/4/2016.  I will go to the post office tomorrow to speak to a supervisor. So sad.<//Review>

<Review>OMG! I think I may have dropped by job ID badge while at the counter at the post office. The problem is I cannot reach anyone by phone. The phone number is redirected to the fax machine, and I tried emailing the supervisor and after inputting everything I received an error message. I need to contact someone there to find out if anyone found or turned in my badge, but cannot! How frustrating! :-/</Review>< Pictures>

Probably the worst post office ive ever had to deal with. They don't answer the phone.. And if they do on accident, they hang up and just let it ring.. And its connected to the fax machine and automatically disconnects. The only thing that makes it ok. Is my mail man. He is a really nice guy. But unfortunately everyone else he works with hates their job<//Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Piss poor and disfunctional. I completed online mail-hold before leaving for a 5-day vacation, get back home and see mail stacked-up in my mailbox (no hold at all). With mail theft on the rise I can no longer trust them to hold mail when I request it. Secondly, I also have a P.O. box at this location for my business. I have received checks from my customers more than 6-weeks after the post mark, when I have already issued late fees, insinuated blame on my customers for not paying on-time, cancelled checks, reissued checks, assuming the entire time the post office was doing their job and never considering they were the culprits all along. Lastly, I have a different mail carrier everyday and sometimes they leave my mail at other houses. It's obvious they are circiling the drain and are not getting better. For both business and personal reasons I am highly considering going to the next town for usps service to reagain my confidence in the usps system.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Lost overnight package!! On Wed. 11/16/2016 we shipped an overnight package to our son who is in college in Kansas. It was supposed to be delivered on Friday 11/18/2016 by 3 pm. It didn't make it and as of today Monday 11/21 the post office has no idea where it is because it has yet to be scanned at the next location. A supervisor at the Novato main location authorized a refund however when I asked about the $800 contents of the package his response was "Ut oh"! Really....that's all you have to say is "Ut Oh"?? Unprofessional, rude and insensative. The USPS has one job...to deliver mail & packages and in this case they failed to deliver.<//Text>

Very professional and knowledgeable. I have been struggling 2.5 with pain and had 4 unnecessary surgeries from referrals to specialists before Katie came to the office. Katie performed one test in her office and nailed exactly my medical condition. I'm now slowly becoming pain free and can again see a bright future. Can't tell Katie enough how grateful I am also including my family having their mom, sister, and aunt back. Lot's of love to Katie and of course the support staff..love Dr. Prabaker's office ❤<//Text>< pictures>

I am very pleased with this office. I never have to wait. I like that they are practicing preventative medicine with me. I don’t feel like I have to wait for a heart attack to receive quality medical care.< /Review>

I just lost my primary of 25 years and was recommended here. Katie is my NP. And I couldn't be more happy. They really take the time to listen, very thorough and caring. So thankful to have a new Primary who cares.< /review>

Katie PA-C conducted my annual physical this past Jan 29th. As always, she gives me time to update her with details from specialists and any changes since last visit. Katie asks good questions and provides all the time I need to respond. I feel very comfortable with Katie Dr. Prabaker and staff with regards to my health issues and concerns.<//Review>

Yesterday I had my first appointment at this office and everything was great. The staff is very professional and kind and they follow all the regulations to keep everything safe. The medical assistant and nurses that saw me addressed all my questions and concerns in a very kind and knowledgeable way. The staff at the front desk was also very helpful and courteous. The service at this medical practice is wonderful.< /Review>

This will probably get another star as time goes on, as this was my initial appointment. At first impression, there was lots of activity, but things seemed to flow very well. There were tvs' to watch in the waiting area, and the chairs were comfortable. Once at the sign-in desk, the greeters were friendly and efficient. It seemed as though they truly enjoyed being there, and the interaction between them created a fun, efficient and pleasant atmosphere. So far so good! As is quite usual for a late afternoon appointment, schedules run late (about 15 minutes). I filled out some paperwork and was then led to an "intermediate" room where I answered some billing and history questions for about 10 minutes. I was then led to the "last" room where the doctor would eventually see me. The assistants were very nice and congenial as well. A few more questions, and then the doctor came in and explained his philosophy and goals to me. It was easy to tell that he was very "sharp", and genuinely cared about his patients. We chatted for several minutes, and the PA (Physicians assistant) ordered my medications to my source Pharmacy. All in  all, an easy and pleasant experience that set me at ease for future visits. I left feeling that I had made a great choice in Doctors, and feel comfortable in the quality of care. I'm not sure if it gets any better than that!<//review>

She works diligently on ways to improve my health. As well as being a  very competent practitioner she is also a very caring person with a good  bed side manner. I would recommend here highly to anyone.
I also appreciate Renee who as always been a friendly and competent person in the front office. Thank you also to Jasmine who is an assistant to my practitionet Katey. She is also very helpful and friendly.

Horrible service. Their billing department doesn't know what they are doing.
They called my father, scheduled him in for a follow up appointment and when he arrived, they told him that he has an outstanding balance and he needs to pay for it before they can see him.
My father is 75 years old and has straight medical and medicare with no out pocket expense.
Apparently they just wanted to see him so they can collect their money.
Changing the doctor today.<//text>

From the confirmation of my appointment 2 weeks before the schedule to day before, the assigned staff
showed mastery in her job and so did the front office and back office MAs. They were so methodical in their workflow! So courteous and winsome! And the provider is new but already showed confidence in her new role! And what was so awesome is it is a one-stop office. I had my referrals, immunization and blood drawn in the same office so that when I got checked out, I only had to schedule for a follow up visit on all my work up and visit!
I really intend to recommend this office to all my relatives and friends!</text>

<Text>Dr. Prabaker is the very best physician; no complaints here. Is the office and billing that are not the best. When dealing with specific individuals, not bad! But when Dr. Prabaker is out of town and one needs to contact the office, you go direct to vice mail and or they want an extension for a specific individual or if one needs a prescription they do not give an extension inwhich to make a request. Also, the patient gets a bill once during a six months in which the bill accumulates and is billed. If you are on a fixed income that makes paying the bill more difficult. Bill once a month and this makes paying much easier. Also, sometimes one must wait in front office for appointment, sometimes over 30-45 minutes!<//Text></record>

Very very friendly staff and very funny but professional. There was very minimal waiting time where I wasn't able to complete the paperwork I was filling up before they called me. They where very through with my file and asked me about my health concerns. It was nice that one of the receptionist recognize my voice from the phone and remembered my name at the end of the day.<//text>

I've never had a more sincere, transparent, and honest conversation than with Dr. Prabaker, ever. I know I made a good choice. Looking forward to continuing visits and positive direction going forward.
The staff are equally pleasant as well.</review>

With a staff that is friendly, caring, helpful, and upbeat, visiting Dr. Prabaker is always a happy experience.  The Dr. himself is superb, always warm and helpful, always thorough, always listens.  I feel so blessed to have found the medical community that works in this office.<//Text>

Staff was very friendly but I had a lot of questions concerning my health and I didnt get to ask half of them. I felt very rushed. Front desk seemed all over the place - nice staff . But didn’t seem very organized at all. And I didn’t get to see the doctor I made my appointment with with I don’t understand .<//Review>

Office staff in complete chaos.  Doctor didn't even know why I was there (prescription review.)  Had to wait nearly an hour and a half. Currently on hold with them for a prescription renewal (10 minutes.)  Might have been a good doc once, but not now!!!<//review>

They dont know how to bill properly. You would think they would since they are always dealing with the insurance.  They sent me to collections because of a mistake they made! They were trying to bill the wrong department my insurance told them and gave them the info and they still did nothing but send me to collections.  Greedy unprofessional people</text>

Please Note- This bad review is base SOLELY on one aspect of this office and nothing else. IF the problem is resolved I would gladly rate this location 5 stars.

I have been coming to this location for almost a year and a half now and have always had excellent care, however the one department that posed a problem a year ago that I haven't had to worry about until now is the referral department. Out of pity, I will not mention the person's name who currently is the root of my problem with this office, and instead I will simply stick to the facts.

On my last visit- April 2nd, 2018 I was told that I would require an MRI and that the request would be submitted as soon as possible as it sometimes takes a while to get approval from Insurance. A week later I was contacted by the MRI office and told to schedule an appointment, which I did for Saturday, April 14th, 2018 (tomorrow).

Yesterday, (Thursday) April 12th, I was contacted by the MRI office and told that did not have authorization yet and that they had spoken to the referral person at this office on Monday, but despite having called back Tuesday, Wednesday and that day Thursday, they had not heard anything back. At that point I called myself and also left 2 messages throughout the day, none of which were returned.

Today (Friday) April 13th, I spoke to the MRI office again and was told that they still had not heard back anything from the referral person, so I call and speak to the receptionist and ask to speak with the referral person directly. I finally get through and he tells me that he did speak with the MRI office on Monday, but ignored all questions about why he did not return their calls afterwards, or mine for that matter. He does tell me he submitted the authorization request on April 3rd , which still should have been plenty of time as my appointment was set for April 13th.

This person has always been dismissive, with a poor attitude when it comes to speaking about his work responsibilities and presents a demeanor befitting of someone who neither cares about his job, nor the people affected by his work. He tells me that he will personally call the insurance company. I ask him to do so and to call me back afterwards.

The MRI office calls me again telling me they have still yet to hear back from this person, I tell them he told me he would call the Insurance company. They then tell me that they discovered the reason the approval was not given was that the authorization request this referral person submitted was not properly filled out and incomplete and that was why they couldn't approve. They would only need to speak with him to complete the form and provide approval. The MRI office tells me they have left yet another message for the referral person, explaining this.

I call the referral person at this location and leave yet another message, also explaining this. It is now 5:13pm, and I have not received a call back from him, nor an explanation, apology, nothing. The MRI office tells me that the insurance authorization has not been changed to approved and therefore I will not get the MRI I have needed and patiently waited over 2 months to have done.

As I have not heard back from the referral person to hear his side of the story, or even if he'll be honest at that point, the underlying questions remain: "Why didn't you return IHS' phone calls?" Whatever the answer may be, when the MRI office called Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and left multiple messages, "Why didn't you return their calls?" "Did you check your messages at all?" "Why didn't you return my calls, or answer my messages?"  Bottom line- there is no excuse good enough.

This referral person obviously has fooled himself into believing the best solution for a mistake that he's made is to simply ignore it, utterly disrespecting anyone else's time. This office would be far better off replacing him, or at the very least reprimanding him so that he better understands the value of his employment and respects the responsibilities of his job.<//Text>

I was so very happy to find this awesome place that AAA recommend me and paid for it  ( I was in a car accident  ). Seidner’s were  professional, courteous  and  caring people, my car was ready a day early. Mr John and Ms Cassandra were so nice to me that make me feel at home and confident that my car was in good hands and it was true, they keep me update of the status of my car , they did an excellent job.
I  recommend this great place with my eyes closed !
Thank you very much Seidner’s .

I strongly recommend Seidners Auto Body for their professionalism, great office ethics, and detailed work. I went to the Duarte location and received great assistance from Marcos who came through in having the car properly worked on and ready for use during the holidays . Mercedes was also wonderful providing me with information on the rentals. Seidners  staff was exemplary in following the CDC guidelines. My car was clean looked brand new , I’m absolutely happy with the way everything turned out.</review>

Great job repairing the rear axle and the wait was crazy for the tires but all in all worth the wait. NOT COOL were the scratches to the car caused by Seidners' worker (s). Also NOT COOL want having to return the car and wait again for repairs.</review>

<text>Although I’ve never lived in a small town, Seidner’s gives you that small town feeling.  The receptionist was so nice and friendly and the person that gave me the estimate made me feel welcome and at home and confident that they would do a great job for me.

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I had someone back into my front right bumper in a parking lot and messed up my paint. I took the 2006 F250 down to Seinder's Collision and treated me pretty good. There establishment is very clean and professional. They had a big job to do because I run a Road Armor heavy steel bumper with a warn 16.5Ti winch and 4 head lights in the bumper. Suffice to say its well over 300lbs. It was done the right way, removed, repaired ,repainted. I had to work for 3 days straight and my wife was going to have to pick up that beast of a truck, which she doesn't like to drive. Instead of picking up my wife so she can drive the F250 home, Marco asked if he could have it dropped off. Not only did my truck show up at home, it was washed and parked where "I" park it! Turns out while googling my house he saw a picture of my truck and parked it there. I got home Sunday morning, and inspected my road princess and was very impressed at the work and the wash job. I highly suggest anyone who loves their vehicle to go to Siender's Collision. they are outstanding.
Thanks Marco and your team. I will be seeing you again!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>If you are looking for a collision center this is the place to go to.  I went there because I knew someone who worked there, but he got laid off due to the pandemic.  I got kind of skeptical taking my car there because he was laid off. Qui assured me that Seidners will do a great job.  He was right.  I hope the company hires him back. Thank you Qui,
Besides all that.  I am very very very pleased that I took my car there.   I had an incidents years back when we had those great winds, and a tree fell on my car. Took it to a different place and boy oh boy how unhappy I was, no wonder they are out of business.
Go to Seidners Collision Center you will be very satisfied.< /text>< Pics>

I was incredibly disappointed because i backed into something within days of buying my new Subaru. I brought it here so upset and Marco saved the day. He was so professional and skilled and new exactly what to do. Two minutes after he began the dent repair, it was completely resolved! Thank you so very much!</Text>

<Review>Outstanding experience (second time)!  Absolutely a first-class operation from the minute you walk in the door, greeted and helped by a very professional, friendly staff and our estimator, service rep David was amazing from start to finish.  He kept us updated ...estimate was right on..... and the work was finish way ahead of schedule.
AND the quality of the workmanship is second to none.  When we picked up the car, it looked like it was right off the showroom floor.  Thanks to all the pros at Seidner Collision Repair/Duarte.  Highly recommend.</Review><username>BENOIT PHOTO< /username>< Pictures>

Car gets dropped off on 12/31/19

I signed up for text updates and have received NO texts whatsoever.

I call on 1/9/20 they said it would be done 1/10/20, it was getting a detail and polish. I also have an email from Seidner’s saying that the vehicle took 7 days to repair, and that the vehicle out date was 1/10/20.

I call on the 10th and they say it’s not painted, assembled, or aligned yet, it’ll be done 1/14/20.

I call on the 14th and they said they had a call out, it’ll be done on the 15th, just needs to be assembled.

I call today and they said they JUST got the parts in and will be ready on the 16th.

Why so many different stories? On top of that,
every manager has been avoiding my phone calls and voicemails, so I use another phone to reach them and that’s when they answer.

Still haven’t received any text updates or any callbacks. This is my 6th and LAST time coming to Seidner’s for a repair.<//Review>< Time>

Seidners has worked  on my car twice ,both times after people have backed into my car in the front and the passenger rear door . My biggest concern has always been the paint matching both times they done a great job , my color is alpine white on a BMW they left my car looking like nothing ever happened , after doing a great job on my car twice . I would highly recommend then to anybody that wants their car done right after a accident .After going through the hassle of a car accident at least getting your car done right looking brand new is all you can ask for.</review>

Awesome service from Nick! Went in for an estimate during a lunch break and was told they needed to order a part from Honda. Nick told me he wasn't sure how long it would take but would keep me informed as I went back to work. Got an email that they could get the part that day, finished work, and had my repair finished right after. Nick was very courteous and friendly during the whole process!< /Review>

at Jan 2013 I had a read end collision on my BMW X5 and AAA recommend me go to Seidner ar Duarte, After I go and I find out surprisingly friendly staff. Special my services agent Kenny Martinez. he take care my car very well and return to me 3 days early then promised date ( estimate 4 days he give it back to me after 1 day), also I mention I need small headlight bright up services on my wife's car, he did right away for free. and I was shock. and also 1 week later I had little scratch on bumper the reflector drop to the inside of the bumper, he also did it for me for free.

I can't believe what a wonderful experience I have been through and recommend Seider collision to everyone I know</text>

<Resp>{'time': 1573603700734, 'text': 'We appreciate you coming by to give us the opportunity to repair your 2008 Ford Mustang. The cost we estimated was to remove/reinstall your bumper, repair the damage, repaint the bumper along with installing the stripe on it as well. That also included doing a paint less dent repair on the right quarter panel as well. Our price is very fair for the quality of repairs we perform, paint products used and warranty we issue on those repairs. If you visit any quality auto body shop in the area our price will be competitive with their estimates. Any body shop painting a vehicle for $600 is not using quality warrantied paint materials, using proper painting methods, or following all prepping procedures to ensure the paint adheres and lasts on the vehicle as it should. Yes we are not the cheapest out there but we deliver manufacture certified repairs that over 25 auto dealerships trust along with numerous major insurance companies including Auto Club, State Farm, Allstate and Mercury insurance to name a few.'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Our estimate for under 1K was to completely replace your rear bumper with a new one and paint the bumper to match your vehicle. Our service adviser recommended replacement vs repair and gave you lower labor rates then we charge insurance companies. Our repair costs may not always be the cheapest out there but we perform quality repairs performed by certified technicians and we issue our valued lifetime warranty with every repair we perform. There is always going to be shops out there that cut corners to save money but that is not us and we accept no shortcuts and do what is best for your vehicle. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to repair your vehicle and wish you the best with your repairs.'}<//Resp>

When we called we were clearly told we could smoke both cigars and Hookah. When we arrived there was no outdoor seating and the server said we could not smoke cigars.  It felt like either a bait and switch or an outright lie. There is a nice little cigar/smoke/CBD store next door which had nice prices on Montechristo platinum cigars where I bought one before heading inside sheesha lounge much to my disappointment.

They do have a nice selection of hookah,  bottled water, juice drinks, and comfy lounge couches.  Their Turkish Coffee was actually much milder / weaker than we expected so either it's designed for Starbucks crowds or they don't know how to properly make it.

Prices are reasonable and they'd much better rating if they had not deceived us. Alas, too bad for them.

Lots of locals speaking Arabic which was cool and they knew most of the clients which means they have a dedicated client base which is always a good sign.

Overall a nice place but weak Turkish Coffee and the cigar issue made it a pass for us for future visits.<//Text>

<Text>This is your best choice for a hookah lounge if you're looking for VIP quality for a hookah. Their hookahs are unlike any others and customer service is even more impressive. I've been in many other places, and now I'm certain they have the best artists and hookahs out there. They also have almost any drink you can think of from hot drinks to beverages and beers (no bar though). It's also a great spot if you're hungry and wanna try some middle eastern food from the Sahara Restaurant next door; you can just order the food and they'll be more than happy to bring it to you at the lounge. Go early, preferably before 8-9 pm as this place gets packed almost every day of the week.< /Text><time>1529033203679<//time>< rating>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Such a gem of a place. Nothing like thos in the CA bay area. Was visiting family in Citrus Heights and had to stop by. I was looking for some dart supplies to go with my new bristle board. I came out happy. They actually let you throw the darts before you buy them. Love this place...<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Assume store and web site. Great service and staff. Very knowledgeable about what they sell. A friendly group of people. I never knew there was so much to darts. They even let you try out the darts and give you tips on play. I always have a good time talking with them about darts. They sell lots of other stuff there to. Shuffle board air hockey ping pong. All the fun stuff. If you get a chance stop by and take a peek. You will not be disappointed. Trust me on this one.< /Review>< name>

The best dart store online IMHO. A-Z's prices and selection are great, but what truly distinguishes this site is the detailed product specs. Most sellers indicate a dart's weight only, but A-Z also gives the barrel length and barrel diameter. These dimensions are at least as important as weight to how a dart will throw. Thanks!<//Text>

All the darts, dice, billiards ancillaries one could dream of. Employee to employee relations could be improved upon, if for nothing else, the customer's comfort. It's very awkward as a customer when two employees are blatantly talking trash to each other, reasons having nothing to do with any aspect of business a customer should hear.</Text>

<review>During 2020 we tried visiting multiple times and it just wasn't happening for us. It wasn't until 2021 that the stars aligned and we got the chance to try one of the top listed taco shops in Orange County. We tried the Carne Asada, Al Pastor, and the Birria tacos (quesabirria) with consomé. Surprisingly we loved the Birria tacos here the most. The consomé flavor was on point legit, however the amount of fat on top was excessive. It's definitely worth it, however you might spend some time skimming it.</review><rating>4<//rating>< Response>

This combo isn't even on the menu but they plated it exactly how I asked for it. Always quality ingredients. Some of the best tortillas I've ever had and the birria is so damn good! I couldn't even resist taking a bite before I took the pic. If you're looking for a good meal in Santa Ana this is the place to get it.</Text>

Advanced orders accepted. Good fresh authentic Mexican food. Made to order. Parking, if busy, can be a challenge but we'll worth it. Slow down as you approach or you could miss it.</Text>

<text>Food 5 stars. The tortillas are freshly made, sopes are my favorite. Excellent quality.

Parking: 1 star. Horrific. We were there 30 minutes and saw two people park in the handicap spot with their hazards on. One parked diagonally and the other parked in the handicap loading zone... parking is extremely limited, I would park around the corner instead of entering the lot. There's only one entrance and it's crazy....

Facility: 1 star. Also extremely cramped. Inside the restaurant it's incredibly crowded and cramped to say the least... but hey the food is great!< /text>< time>

El Zamorano has the best tacos I have found in OC. It’s a small spot that doesn’t have a ton of parking but definitely worth a visit if you want authentic Mexican food. Al pastor is my favorite!<//Review>

They open early on Saturdays at 7AM, despite the signage 😉 — Came for breakfast burritos and ordered the burrito clasico and burrito de chorizo con huevo y frijoles (chorizo - eggs - beans). Super friendly staff, would recommend. Gracias Taqueria El Zamorano!</Text>

Omgosh it is a good moist piece of fish.  I am definitely coming back here! It is a hole in the wall type of place.  Simple but has variety, straightforward, no fuss.  2 taco will get you close to full,  3 would probably be perfect.  Asked for their hot sauce on the side instead of on top (that's their default) in case it was too spicy,  and this is probably the way to go.  I was able to control the spiciness, which was great. Parking is small, oh well. The food is fantastic and flavorful so that's what will get people coming in.</Text>< UserId.>

Quality had dropped. I have been a customer for years....over 5 years. But now it's serving sizes have dropped. And flavors are no longer like before. Less meat. Less salsa. Less portions of the burritos. It used it be a great place now it's just so ok. I visited a few times before updating my review.<//Text>

This place was ok! The restaurant is small but homey feeling. The tacos were ok, I asked for verde and got rojo but it was still pretty good. al pastor was ok, not a ton of flavor. The carnitas was really dry and I didn’t finish the taco. Over all it was pretty ok. My friend got the enchilada, sope, taco combo and he said his was good. Agua fresca was super yummy! Parking was really weird but the staff was really friendly!<//review>

Amazing...

I'm in Cali for work training on our wide format machines and our instructor loves this place. I know why...

Chorizo tacos are to die for. El Pastor just as fabulous. The rice and beans delish.

Their chips are some of the best I've ever had.

Friendly staff...

I’m no expert, but these were some of the best soft tacos I’ve ever had, and located in a great part of LA. Definitely worth a visit if you want to eat like the locals. I’ll be going back.< /review>

<Text>Excellent tacos. Tried the el pastor and the chicken tacos and they were both good. They make the tortillas from scratch here.
We went that for lunch in a Friday afternoon and I'm not sure I would ever do that again. Line out the door and slim pickens for tables. I'd come back though.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Highly impressed! This was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. I will crave the corn tortillas here everyday and I'm not even a huge fan of corn tortillas. It was certainly the hole in the wall type place we were looking for. Not fancy by any means but we weren't looking for fancy. We will definitely be back!<//Text>

Taqueria El Zamorano has barely any parking, and is almost always crowded, but that should tell you something about the food.

The food here is amazing - inexpensive and delicious and served in generous portions. Without writing a novel it's tough to describe just how great everything tastes, so if you get a chance to order some tacos...just get one of everything.< /review>

<Review>Being one of the very few places in Costa Mesa that serves tacos and burritos with cabeza and tripa, I really couldn't wait to try this place out. Like other reciews, the parking lot is really small and tight. Luckily for me I came late night and didn't find it too hard to drive and park. I got two cabeza tacos and two tripa tacos. It really fufilled my cravings. The cabeza was soft and tender, lacked some taste but the cilantro and onions and Verde sauce helped. The tripe on the other hand was a bit over cooked and tough to eat but had so much more flavor. If you CANNOT handle spicy , make sure to ask for the sauces on the side! Speaking of sides, I got some chips and guac which complemented the tacos well! They were thick and fried chips is such an upgrade from the regular thin tortilla chips. Overall good experience! Will definitely come back for their quesadilla and burritos next time!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Love the flavor of the food. The place is very small  I recomend order to go, it gets very crowded but food is really good, I order a Milanesa torta and it didn't have beans as it says in the menu but it was good the tacos de carne asada and al pastor very tasty the only thing is that they don't put enough cilantro and salsa, prices are fair and the cashier is extremely nice and CUTE. I recommend this taqueria and it's  just that a good taqueria.</review>

As far as authentic, home made Mexican food goes....this place is the bomb! Family run. You order a taco and lady in the back makes it fresh ON THE SPOT! Everything thing is great. I recommend the carnitas (best eat they got) anything! The cucumber drink is off the hook and refreshing. Good people. Great food.</Review>

Came to buy tacos for the first time I will definitely wont come Back again to this place  definitely need to put more work to sell tacos that are worth paying money. I can go somewhere else where they sell tacos for that same price but what I like about there that is worth paying your money for something that is well cook.< /review>

We are new to the area so of course we checked trip advisor and saw all of the positive recommendations. So decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed, the food was delicious with just the right amount of seasoning and they make all of their tortillas by hand. The only drawback is that it is so popular that parking can be problematic if you have a larger vehicle like a full size pickup.</Text>

<review>Whatwver you do not use grubhub on with them.  The driver dispite his attempt to try to reason with the restaurant was given the wrong order.
We oedere 3 menudos and 1 torta. The driver was given 1 burrito and was told they ran out menudos. I tried getti a refund from grubhub and was denied, I paid 20.00. for a torta.  Very bad service.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Should be named Taqueria El Animale! Horrible service and just as horrible food! One taco had a fake blond hair in it and the other, taco de pastor, tasted like nothing but grease. When the staff were told and if we could exchange for a different taco, the busboy said that we would have to pay for it as well and they wouldn't exchange the terrible tacos. To top it all off, there was a bug next to our table too. Will never go there again or try another home in the wall family restaurant. Better off with the American food chains that take pride in their businesses.< /review>

Overpriced for what you get and the meat isn't that good. I got 3 tacos with rice and beans. The chorizo was good but the cabeza and chicken was really bland. They barely give you any rice and beans. It's a small scoop of both and the rice didn't have too much flavor to it. When I picked up my order, she didn't bother to give me any napkins or utensils. She didn't even ask. Next time, I'm going somewhere else.< /review>

Usually have to park in the neighborhood. They make good tacos for a reasonable price. If u are not a fan of spicy food, be careful.

BOMBAY!!
it doesn't matter what your craving, you end up buying a little of everything.
I love the torta de al pastor, but the chicken tacos are FIRE.
The green posole takes me back to my childhood with every bite.
AUTHENTIC home mom cooked food.
you will not be disappointed!!!<//review>

Sooooo good! I ordered the chicken taco plate with green sauce (not too spicy) and ate it so fast that I forgot to take a picture of how beautiful it looked. This was my second time eating here for lunch,  and it's my new favorite.< /review>

The food is not worth the terrible parking situation.  It looks like someone’s house.  I don’t recommend coming during any type of rush as you will not even be able to maneuver taking a step inside let alone the “parking lot”.  Avoid the parking lot and just park in the adjacent neighborhood<//text>

Being in Santana, I didn't feel like driving into Irvine to get Asian food, Mexican food was what I was craving for the night. Had the 2 taco combo tonight because I didn't want to eat too much, it was more than enough (Had fake tacos for lunch)...it is a decent place, and I also had their horchata and it was pretty homemade. Solid place for sure, though I didn't try their fish tacos that I really like. Cool staff, run by family. I think Taqueria Zamora will be next to try (as referred to by a co-worker who's BF is related to that family).<//Text>

Get the tacos PERIOD.

I kept going back to the counter so I could try all the different types of tacos. All of them were my favorite... And the freshness of the tortilla was unparalleled. Bravo for the chefs at Taqueria El Zamorano!<//Review>

I was excited to try this place, it's got tons of reviews on Yelp but I didn't think it was anything special. I had an al pastor taco and the asada fries and it was so-so. Didn't think it was super good or anything worth making the trip back for. The cashier was super nice so that was pleasant. Oh, and the parking might be an issue - only 4 official parking spots.< /review>

Even though parking is very limited the food is so amazing it is worth whatever inconvenience you have to go through to eat here. Seating is limited so large groups will have trouble with seating. They do offer catering (pick up only) to alleviate the situation.

The restaurant is family owned and operated. Their carnies are top notch and tortillas are made fresh to order. Be aware that their salsa does have a little bite to it so if you are sensitive to spicy get it in the side but it is a must try as their salsa is delicious.<//text>

The sope was ok, mushy bottom, a little messy but good. The gorditas were superb, lightly toasted crispy, not hard, just perfect! Parking was tight, when we left it was difficult to get out because someone parked and blocked the area but also hogged up parking spots! They need to paint/stripe it to maximize car space.

I love their tacos. The tortillas taste so good. Fast service. The only problem is the parking. It is hard to find an available parking so if you come during lunch hours you might want to park on the street< /review>

<review>Nice hole in the wall, went late night with my grandmother and sister. We're asian and my grandma is a chain restaurant eater. Needless to say she loved the fish tacos except that they put on the salsa for her which was too spicy. My sister had the sopes which she enjoyed. I had the tripas and cabeza which were very good. Probably the best tripas to my taste. The texture was exactly what I was looking for. Very crispy and slightly tender. Very smol space with outdoor seating.</review><user>112793775184702863618<//user><resp>None<//resp></record>

<response>None<//response><username>Salma Brettman</username><Pics>None<//Pics><review>My sister and nephews were visiting from NY and finding tacos is always on their list. After the Discovery Cube we found this taco gem not too far away. It's a tiny place but there's seating both inside and outside with a small lot. There's some neighborhood parking on the side streets as well. We had the chicken and asada tacos and a quesadilla for the little ones. Their cantaloupe and pepino agua frescas were so refreshing and not super sweet. The tacos were full of flavor and I'm normally not a chicken taco person, (I always go for the asada at taco trucks) but the seasoning and perfectly cooked chicken won me over. We beat the line, but you can tell this place probably gets busy at lunch. I'll be back for taco Tuesday's!</review><Date>1571320763312<//Date>< Gmap_id>

<name>Iam Williz< /name><Time>1532818863236<//Time><Rate>2<//Rate><Text>been a loyal customer since they opened, good food but found my self having to pay 4 bucks - $4 for salsa!
that's $4 for 8 - 2 oz small containers, basically paying for all the materials needed to make an entire bowl on a 5 item/$40 order.

wouldn't mind if i was told ahead of time, since i've never been charged for salsa before. when i reviewed my receipt and brought it up to their attention i was told - our food is already prepared with salsa if more is needed there's a charge. I don't pay for extra napkins, i don't pay for limes, i don't pay and always decline a plastic bag, and i will no longer bring you my business for making me pay for salsa with such a sad excuse.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Our go-to spot for tacos in Santa Ana whenever we're in the area. We actually drive out of our way sometimes just to go here. Always get the tacos but I'm sure everything else on the menu is great, too. Salsa is nice and hot, goes great with all the types of tacos they serve. My favorite is the chorizo, while my wife prefers the carnitas. Parking lot is supet tiny, but we manage to get a spot every time we go. Not sure about street parking.<//text>

To start, this food here is pretty good. But be careful because there is very little parking. I think the tacos were too expensive ($2.25 for a ~4" taco). Overall probably would go again if in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to get some.<//Review>

The al pastor tacos are amazing.  I think the thin slice of pineapple on each taco really gives it a great sweet and spicy flavor.  If the new owners had kept the taco Tuesday promotion I would give this place a 5.  I'd also go more often.  Be sure to carpool because there won't be parking.< /review>

Honestly the best tasting authentic Mexican period.

I see people just enjoying whatever they've ordered.   I love the gorditas and tacos since they use fresh maza to make them. Devine tasting maza makes the tacos and gorditas delicious. I believe anything you order will be awesome.

The place is small and parking is limited but it don't stop anyone from coming in. When I am in the area I make my way here since I live 40 miles away.  I discovered it when I worked in Santa Ana.<//Review>

What can I say. Honestly a great place to eat. Family oriented, family owned and very friendly! Only downside is parking but everything else is amazing. Hope they open another one in Costa mesa.<//text>

<date>1521315781767</date><user>114043502229302520503< /user><review>I liked the food. They had a variety of Mexican dishes and even had a few options for vegetarians and vegans (vegans very limited). The person working the register was both helpful and friendly in helping me construct my order. They have indoor and outdoor seating for dining but you order at the counter. They offer a delicious cucumber drink (I tried), as well as a strawberry drink and horchata. They appear to have other standard canned and bottled drinks in a refrigerated case but I didn't inquire about them. I had the Veggie burrito and was shocked at how good it was. It has avocado in it which helps everything in my book. I also had a papas taco and a soyrizo taco. Both were good as well. They offer a green sauce and a red sauce. I've always been partial to that style of green sauce. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area. In fact I'll probably make special trips there. The biggest con I found was a very limited parking lot with a  single driveway that only accommodates one car regardless of direction. To exit the lot you must either back out or do a tight 3-point turn to head out.< /review><rating>4< /rating></record>

Parking lot is tiny. . Be sure to back in otherwise you're going to have a tough time getting out. 5 takes our so inside the restaurant and there is additional seating outside.

I came for tacos. About 2.25 per taco.
Love the hand made tortillas. Definitely worth the extra premium they charge per taco. Had the al pastor and Carne asada tacos. They were good. I really wish the pineapple stood out a bit more though for the pastor. Some more sweet and savory contrast with those bomb tortillas would have made this place 5 stars for me.

The staff dude was nice. The ladies in the kitchen were also nice.

This place is closed on Sundays.</Text>

I go back to this place often. Parking can be a little of a pain. But, it is worth it. Try their shrimp taco. It is legit. The rest of it is awesome as well. You can’t go wrong.<//Text>

Definitely your typical 'hole-in-the wall" type taqueria, but well worth it.  Had a tasty carne asada burrito and was not disappointed.  Only downside is the parking lot is small!  Check this place out.<//text>

The carne asada is dry and bland and the al pastor is decent at best. I don’t know if it was an off day but there are so many taco options in CA that have blown me away.

From the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall restaurant with tight parking but I gotta agree with the other yelpers, this place hands down has best carne asada in the area. They make their tortillas in house which is a huge plus. You can tell this place does not skimp on quality. The employees seem pretty nice, I couldn't find anything wrong with the place, even the horchata had the right amount of sugar, not too sweet.< /review>

4.5, very tasty asada burrito (no beans) with side of guacamole. Didn’t read the menu fully, should have gone all meat for $2 more, saw it after my order was made. Parking is pain if you go during busy hours.</Review>

Excellent food, loved the fresh made cucumber drink. My favorite food were the al pastor, fish and shrimp tacos. My husband is very picky about any food, but this time he said "they got thumbs up on the al pastor tacos!!!" We both loved the handmade tortilla. The owner and his family were very friendly and welcoming. This place is definitely a keeper for our tacos crave!!!<//Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>Not your average taco spot.

We have passed this place numerous times before but after finally yelping it we ended up here.

Staff- Very friendly, makes for a home-like environment.
Tacos- AMAZING; um handmade tortillas made to order?! YUM

I got 4 tacos: 1-al pastor/ 1-asada/ 2-fish & 1 agua de horchata
My gf got 5: 2-asada/2-carnitas/1-chorizo & 1 jugo de tamarindo

Everything tasted fresh and delicious though I do wish we could add our own salsa to our liking.

The tacos are a bit overpriced in my opinion and our drinks were a miss. My gfs drink was really sour and mine was really, really sweet, almost as if they used a store bought mix?</text>< Pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I like how they offer a wide variety of food options. This is not your regular taco joint, you can also get carne asada fries and nachos. The location is very clean. Parking is very tough, they only offer about 6 or 7 parking spots otherwise there is street parking. The prices for tacos are a bit on the higher end but still pretty tasty.<//text>< Pictures>

We've been to the Warner location and that has pretty good food, just came to the new Costa Mesa location and the food is just as good. Spread the word, gotta keep these small gems going. Definitely add a chorizo taco to whatever you get lol<//Text>

After seeing the reviews I decided to check it out for myself. I think this place is a little pricey. The asada was dry, however the pork is what i would go with instead. I spent $50 (was a little shocked by the price but i was hoping it would be very worth it) the chicken enchilada was idk how old. The sope was good though ..the rice and beans they give you is such a small portion .The food came with 2 small salsa. I feel like $50 of food needed more salsa than 2 but the man said they charge for additionals. They also have a bar with pico de gallo, guacamole, onion, cilantro, lemon etc. For which they charge additional if you want some of that. I dont get that at all. I think it was so rude of the guy to give me a hard time about salsa. I will never return and i dont think this place deserves the rating they have . There are so many better taco places around with complimentary sides.<//Review>

This is literally one of Santa Ana's hidden little gems. The food here is alwas good . It will have you thinking it's your mothers cooking. Not to mention their chilaquiles are so dang good that it will be hard to switch on to another dish. You can tell its family owned so everytime I can , I try to stop by and show my support by helping myself to super delicious Mexican cuisine.<//text>

This place has awesome Tacos. They have the classics, Pastor, Asada, Potato, shimp, etc. Burritos, Quesadillas, tortas, and sopes. The Tortillas are made fresh, you can see the hard working lady in the kitchen, making the tortillas in front of you. Pastor and Carnitas will have to be my favorite, the salsa was good but not spicy enough for me but since it's the only kind they had I had to suck it up. Sopes were bomb too, the the sour cream and queso fresco, nailed it! We were there on a Friday about 6pm and the place was not that busy, so it ended up being perfect for us. We will be back soon to try some more stuff.< /Review>

<Text>5 Stars for Food alone, minus 1 star because of Parking.
Tortillas are FRESH!!, Horchata and other drinks are fresh too.
The salsa is just so well balanced, the meat is tasty with right mix of seasoning, food is prepared correctly.

The only thing is the parking, very limited, other then that this place would get 5 starts.

The FOOD does get FiVeS though...just beware of the parking.

<Review>Ok first off the tacos here are just okay, nothing special. I hate going to places where you have to beg for salsa. To a Mexican the salsa is what makes the tacos. It's like the cherry on top of a sundae🍨Now the size of the tacos for the price is a rip off!! It's like where's the beef.. Aside from that, their shrimp tacos are good. I'll only go back for the shrimp tacos, & beg for salsa. Other than that I'll go get carnitas/asada tacos somewhere else!!!! There are bigger better tacos worth the price, & you won't have to beg for salsa. 🙄I can name a few, but won't... seek & you will find! 😋 Oh and for those of you that have said this place is the best place you've ever had,  you need to get out more!! 🤔< /Review>< time>

I love Taqueria el zamorano! It has great proximity to the OC Metro office area where I work. The food is high quality and fresh and the service is excellent. I also enjoy ordering food from them to go. I highly recommend this place to anybody who likes authentic Mexican food.<//Text>

<Review>This is our 3rd or 4th visit here since being introduced to this taqueria by friends. We've tried almost everything and it's really good. My favorite are the al pastor tacos or any of their tacos really. So good and fresh. If you don't like spicy then make sure to get the salsa on the tacos on the side.</Review>< pictures>

It's my go-to spot for mexican food. This place has the bomb dot com tacos. The corn tortillas are all handmade. You can't go wrong ordering anything from here! The cucumber drink is refreshing and if you can get your hands on the banana horchata, do it! It doesn't come around often.<//Review>

Great service. They have the best tacos de papas. Well presented and good price. Two will make you full. Add a carne asada burrito and call it a meal. Verrrrry flavorful. 10 stars.
Los tacos de papas son los mejores.MUY RICO Y DELICIOSO.<//Review>

I do want to come back and try their carne asada fries. Cons parking is limited and the place itself is small too. It was tricky to get out of the parking lot becuase of the busy street.

<review>There is no doubt that it is hands down, the best eats of California! Vacationing from Arizona to Disneyland El Zamorano's is the go to spot for a down home, respectful soulful Hispanic meal!! The customer service is as if you are family! The flavor of the carne asada amazing! The rice is not dry! The beans are the right amount of salt flavor. The salsa is tasteful! The guacamole is original! We ate on real plates!! The awesome part is that we felt that we were eating at someone's home. The tortillas are the highest grade! All around a great place to eat!!! The total environment is positive!!! We wish that your restaurant was in Arizona!! Amazing!!!<//review>< resp>

<Text>Parking lot is impossibly small and hilariously difficult to get into.

The food is pretty decent. Handmade tortillas make everything better. You can't go wrong with tacos or burritos. My go-tos are Asada, Pastor, and Cabeza, but then again, that's my go-to anywhere.

Lunch time is usually packed so come with a partner so they can snag you a seat as you order the food.

Bonus points for serving the food on plates that make you feel right at home at your abuelas place.</Text>< pics>

From out of town and I stumbled onto this place by accident while looking for some good Mexican food. There is no shortage of options in this general area, but we decided to try it out because it was highly reviewed and I was glad that I did! Parking was a little cramped but we got a spot and the food was delicious. This place has one of my favorite salsas and the carne asada and carnitas were amazing! I have starred this place for my next visit into town.<//text>

<Review>Delicious! You definitely should go here. Guacamole is chunky and fresh! Tacos are a bit spicy for me, but I'm a wimp. It doesn't stop me from getting their carnitas. Mmmm..<//Review>< Pics>

It would have been just as amazing if the milanesa was a decent size. FYI milanesa=breaded steak. I had received a paper thin piece. So my torta was basically bread. My hubby got a chicken burrito with everything and thought it was good but wished I got the salsa on the side. The place was empty when I showed up for a late lunch. It was clean and very fast.</Review>< pictures>

My favorite Mexican joint in OC. The carnitas is amazing and I can never get enough of the orange salsa (even though it makes me sweat). Agua fresca with cucumber is also awesome. Only thing that sucks is the parking lot but I always come away from the lunchtime rush.</review>

Hole in the wall, but great place with amazing tacos. Only drawback was no air conditioning and it was above 90 the day I visited.<//Review>

< Review>
I tried their al pastor, asada, pollo, and lengua tacos. My favorite was al pastor. It's chunky, crispy outside, with fatty porky meat just hit the spot. With combination of homemade tortilla (yes! i can see their mom just pressing down on that fresh homemade tortilla in their open kitchen) and their kickass spicy sauce gave a perfect street taco flavors. I have to say, Taqueria El Zamorano is my favorite taco spot in OC. Other tacos were good but not as memorable as al pastor. It's family run business with friendly family staff. I also tried their cucumber drink, which was delicious if you want to try other than the usual horchatas. This is one of these spots where I'm afraid to tell people knowing that it maybe too popular, but then I wish their business will grow so that they can sustain this good business.< /Review>

Met my old roommate at this place and had a great time -
Sat in the bar with the piano and listened to him play some great music - had some wine and one of the best pizzas I've ever had - love the old world Italian decor - great place to meet friends or even go on a date.< /Text>
