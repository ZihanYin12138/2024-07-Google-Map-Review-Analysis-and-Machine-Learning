<gmapID>0x80dc09936c896743:0xee8af515780ca0ce<//gmapID><Review>Eat here.  I 'd previously enjoyed their Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad at the Mission Valley location and wanted to have it again while at the One Paseo boutique outdoor mall.  This is the salad of my dreams.   It's a huge amount of food for a very modest price and it's loaded with goodies.  The grilled chicken is mostly thigh meat with very crispy skin and so tender inside.  Intensely flavorful, thanks to all the seasonings and probably too much salt.  But hey.  All the other ingredients were top quality and very generous as well.  Bacon was also crispy-tender in nice chunks.  Tomatoes so tomato-y.  Perfect amount of eggy tarragon dressing.  Really too much food for a normal lunch but I couldn't stop eating.  The only slight miss was the grilled slice of sourdough that came with it.  Probably sat a bit too long after grilling but still edible.  I'll pass on that next time.  But their mint lemonade was a perfect accompaniment to the salad.  Very tart and very sweet at the same time.

It's also a very pleasant place to be.  Super friendly and helpful staff.  An array of heaters outside for chilly days but seating indoors as well.  Very clean and attractive.  Window shopping along pretty One Paseo is a nice bonus.  There is ample free parking in two garage structures.  What more could you want?<//Review>< response>

They opened this place about six month ago. The whole complex is new.

The place is very clean, light, plenty of seating, with good fresh food. The menu is pretty rich and service is prompt.

Katherine, the manager took care of us and Max attended us endlessly.

Overall, our big group was carded for with good food and service.

Although, we have been in other locations, this one stands out for all the above.<//Review>< pictures>

The salad with salmon and tomato soup was tasty! Bit pricey, 2 salads (one with salmon, other just greens) and 2 small soups $40.</text>

We absolutely love coming to the one Paseo tender greens. The food is always fresh and healthy at a good price. Get the specials when they have them. I had the Katsu chicken bowl and loved it! Get the specials when you can. They are great! As is Fernando the chef.</review>

<Review>Hands down one of the best healthy/tasty options in southern California. Started coming here a few months back and am hooked. Food quality is consistently perfect, steaks are always just the right amount of medium rare and they seem to take pride in making everything taste great. On top of that, the staff is easily the friendliest I've encountered in a restaurant bar none. Have yet to have a bad or even like warm experience. Mani, the head chef, in particular is awesome. Comes out to chat with you about food quality and whatever else you want. If I could give this place 100 our of 5 stars I wouldn't hesitate!<//Review>< Pics>

Salmon plate with baby arugula, steak with potatoes, and chicken noodle soup were cooked and seasoned to perfection. Each time I visit Tender Greens, I leave satisfied and content with the value and price point. Each location has it's quirks, but this particular location had excellent customer service, very clean tables, and open space. Would definitely return when in the area. A+++</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I normally like Tender Greens, like I remember when they started out in Liberty Station and now grown so big. This location is okay though. We usually order to go. The amount of lettuce is inconsistent. Sometimes I get like regular portion other times I get a very little amount. Also the service here isn’t that attentive. Seems like they just talk a lot and don’t even give you forks for to go items.< /Text>< name>

<review>Good food and nice atmosphere, however the prices are pretty high for portion size. I'm ok with smaller sizes, but the prices should reflect that. The timing on meal prep seems to be a little off too - we all ordered on one tab, at the same time, but our 3 meals came at separate times, 10 minutes apart from the 1st to the 3rd.<//review>< pics>

Food is good and I love the drinks but this place is a mess organization wise. Didn't get the glass for the drink ordered, husband's plate came out well before son's which was 5min before my plate finally arrived and I had to inquire about the glass. Never had this issue with another location<//Text>

My salad had a big long black hair in it so I'm probably not the best person to review this place. I will say the salmon on my salad was delicious,  but after pulling the hair out of my mouth, couldn't eat it. They gave me another salad, but wish they had given me a refund. Probably won't be back here since there are so many other choices, but definitely not a bad place for healthy eats, minus the hair.< /Review>

Nothing earth shattering. The food was a bit oily but still dry. I asked for seasonal vegetables as a side, but that turned out to be 100% potatoes. Waiter wouldn't change the side order with something else ;(</Text>

We love all the Tendergreens. Especially the new Del Mar location. Hani is the main manager was brought over from the Mission Valley location because of his success at that location which is also being run by a great staff and great management . Their food is fresh, healthy great variety of grilled food to choose from. I love their grilled chicken cob salad . Their home made chocolate chip cookies 🍪 are awesome . Stop by the Del Mare location and see how sweet this new place is . Easy to get to and lots of parking . Great place for the kids to play in the park right in front of the restaurant . 😎🎯👍🏻🇺🇸🎶<//Review>

< review>
This is such a crammed place, hardly any space for shopping around. Veggies were poor quality and some of them costed almost thrice as other leading stores in the Bay Area. Sweets we bought from here had gone bad right on day one. We had bought the same sweets from elsewhere and had lasted over a week. So this store definitely carried stuff older than a week. It’s a hopping distance to our home but will never visit again.</review>

Used to be a good store. Staff are good. Store is clean and well arranged. Unfortunately prices are way too high. They are extremely expensive (some items as much as $2 higher) compared to New India Bazar which is on Mary Ave.< /Text>

<Text>Since last couple of months since they changed the name of shop they have been keeping things highly organized and clean. Before that, i never used to buy vegetables from there because they were not fresh. But since last few months, they have become better and more organized.

They also do free home delivery but havent tried that service.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>You can find lots of Indian spices and daals here but this place is usually over crowded.

Prefer to come in a group where one person can stand in queue whereas others can grab stuff for a quick checkout.

At the moment this place offers 5% off your entire order above $55</Text><pics>None<//pics></record>

They are thief and dishonest people. Their prices on shelves are lower than what they have in system. Even after asking to update the prices they don't change them or give u refund. They thug u and cheat u in every transaction.

Also their paneer had fungus many times<//review>

This was SO good, they were incredibly nice (helpful & really sweet bcz Idk sht about Indian food) and the wait times were awesome so that was wonderful. The food all on its own would have me come every single day if I lived close enough. They're all delicious, I wish I could order spicy ones I tried a couple different things I hadn't had and everything was fantastic.<//Text>

<review>I now have a new favorite Indian food place!”Indian Rasoi” translates to “Indian Kitchem”. It’s a small and simple place right on the newly revitalized, Ventura Avenue. The samosa channa, spinach paneer, jasmine rice with caraway seed and veggie korma, were all perfect! The portions were generous and the price was very affordable. The staff person was courteous and very helpful with my to go order. I will be back.</review>< pictures>

I just ate here for the first time and I have to say it was one of the most satisfying meals I’ve ever had in Ventura County. Everything was flavorful and felt very clean and healthy. I am trying to save money by cooking at home but Indian Rasoi may have just thrown a wrench in my plan!</review>

<response>None< /response><Review>Good food, had better but it's authentic for sure. Liked the desserts and drink options, I tried them all- I like the milk cakes, but it aint for everyone (im Asian, not picky with my food I prefer it simple, although I never hate on new things, I never let people claim authenticity on foods if its not fact). I am very analytical/specific with my foods.
Had the paneer(cheese) naan. Was shredded cheese, i was expecting melted so it could have been better. Curry and rice portions were perfect, I was full and satisfied with no it is off of one curry and rice. Didn't go spicy with my curry cuz I wanted to actually taste the flavors of the curry, so I cant account for how the spicier currys taste. Shared my dessert and drinks. Im very picky with my food places because there are so many places to try, so I would introduce someone to this place, but personally I would not go back.

Covid regulations-Must have mask, to go only (Idk about delivery) no sit down, 6 feet (less than 8 people in the shop at a time), you can order and stay inside to wait for food unless too many people come in at once then you must wait outside (they will either call you in or give you the food once ready) hand sanitatizer available.</Review>< gmapID>

<text>Such great food!! The quality and taste is amazing and it's priced very well! I love that it's one of the only Indian take out places in Ventura country so when ever I'm feeling Indian food, it's my go-to place! Highly recommend!<//text></record>

Prices are excellent, and portions are generous and food always tastes freshly prepared, and nothing ever seems like it came from a freezer.  I eat here several times a week, and this is a great place run by a local family.  If you like Indian food, you will not be disappointed.</Review>< pictures>

Great food and great people. The family run staff is very friendly and helpful with explaining the dishes. Prices are fair and portions are generous. Although the shop has few frills everything is clean and well kept, perfect spot to grab a quick bite.<//Text>

I Truely enjoyed my experience at this very friendly and comfortable restaurant. The food is AMAZING and the family that runs this colorful, quaint place are genuine and care about the authentic quality of the food they prepare and serve! I can't say enough about my meal, the flavors of each dish are rich with warm spices that tantalize my taste buds! THANK YOU INDIAN RASOI!!! I will return....< /Text>

Absolutely wonderful food served in a quick and casual counter service manner. Great veggie options and for Indian food the price point can't be beat. The staff at Indian Rasoi is warm, welcoming and care about the dishes they're serving as well as how your day is going. Definitely a welcomed flavor to the neighborhood.< /review>

I've eaten at Indian Rasoi a handful of times now and each visit is as delicious as the last.  Everything I've tried is incredible, fresh, and homemade with love.  It's also a family run business, ..it shows, they care so much about their food and customers.  Highly recommend.</review>

Not fresh. Vegetables look like frozen medley. Owner rude. Super salty. Got stomach pains for 2 hours. Not good. Also using styrofoam and super thick plastic take out containers. Lame.< /review>

<time>1573322751874<//time><rate>5< /rate><Review>Everything I’ve tried is premier delicious! A beautiful father-son team (at least when I’ve been there). Only 6-8 dishes in the steam tray (behind glass- they serve you) at one time, but who needs more? Pakora last night we’re the best I’ve ever had anywhere (and made fresh to order)! Samosa and naan also available. My favorite fish so far is the saag (or palak?) paneer. Bright, colorful and zingy! Enormous portions and great value! The only thing I’d like to see them do better is get their dishes and washing system down so there’s less reliance on disposable (but at least the ‘plate’ size take out is paper, not plastic). A really lovely business I hope will thrive!< /Review>< Pictures>

We thought both had excellent flavor. The garlic naan was solid. This is owned by a local family and fully deserves support of the community. My only wish was that the Tikka came with a bit more heat. That was not a concern with the vindaloo as that came with strong heat. Strong recommend.</text>< pictures>

Very good service. Fast ,attentive and caring service. They by far have my service in any future matters hands down. The staff was sweet the doctor seemed to be very on point and caring .I left feeling better about the issue I was there for. Peace of mind. Biggest thing for me was the cleanliness of this office, it was impeccable 👍🏼< /review>

This is the worst company ever. At the beginning of Covid pandemic around May 2019 I thought I had Covid so I wanted to take a test. I called ahead of time and they verified my insurance was accepted and would pay in full. When I had my appointment it took about an hour past my appointment to be seen by the doctor within 10 minutes they took my swab and sent me on my way. A week later I got a letter in the mail stating to call for my test results. I called them several times throughout the week but no one answered the phone. I finally went to the office in person and they said their phone lines have been out. I got negative test result 3 weeks after my visit, so it was basically useless. I thought that was the end of it but then I got a bill in the mail stating my insurance wasn't covering and it would be over $200 out of pocket. I called them several times and emailed their central billing and no one responded (to this day no response). I kept trying but nothing. A week later I got another bill and I called and held over 30 minutes and was finally able to speak to someone who quickly said it was an error on their end and to disregard the bill I received and that my fee would be waived. Now over a year later they send my bill to collections. SERIOUSLY?<//text>

There was also no signage indicating if and where I needed to check in. And no signage indicating where I should wait to be called in for a Covid-19 test- in the waiting room? In my car? I understand that staff may be stretched thin and that did not worry me. I do feel like clear, well placed instructions should be posted on the door and in the waiting area so that all patients may remain safe.That said, all the staff were professional, friendly and the facility was very clean.<//review>< user_id>

<review>Online appointment system works well. However plan on still waiting I waited 1
1/2 hours after my appointment time.The staff is friendly and helpful. The doctor that saw me was very nice and tried to help but I was told if my eye did clear up go to emergency  they also won't give work note so if you work for employer where you have to prove you saw a doctor don't bother with this urgent care go to emergency.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Online appointment is a must, go to their website before heading out to save your place in line and to reduce wait times. It's quick and easy, we got there 30 minutes prior to scheduled appointment time and we were seen right away. The nurse and doctor that helped us were really nice, and gave a detailed diagnosis. I didn't feel like they were in a hurry, unlike other urgent care facilities. For a Saturday morning, it was pretty empty, but that's not always the case, so dont forget to schedule online or call before you go!<//review>

<review>Slow,  and not at all helpful. I made an appointment today, came after work and was told that they will not test me because I have Kaiser. They also will not take cash payments either. I think there was some mention that if I was going to use my insurance then I needed to bring the card with me. So, I was kind of surprised that I could not get tested.< /review>< pics>

It wasn't crowded when I was there on Valentine's day at 8:40pm. Everyone there was professional & quite nice. The atmosphere was pleasantly quiet. I saw Dr. Scott Mastores & really appreciated him taking the time to explain when to use foot boot, how to use crutches, keep my foot elevated above my heart and to apply heat on my foot 4x a day until I can get into see Orthopedic Doctor. He even adjusted the crutches to accommodate me better & had my boyfriend come back in & suggest he do his best to offer me moral support while I adjust to my (temporary) new way of getting around!</text>

My review of MedPost urgent care in Cerritos:

Review Update 8/6/20
Once of the managers at MedPost just called me to address my issue and he was very kind and acknowledged my feelings about my experience, he was very apologetic and explained that the provider I saw was someone whom they contracted out to cover for the day and not one of their regularly staffed providers. I’m glad that he took the time to find out more info and get to the bottom of the situation, and he thanked me for my review stating that without my feedback they wouldn’t know how to improve their services; I’m pleased that they’ve taken the right steps to address the situation and to show more compassion. I will give this place another chance.

Dr. G_ _ _ _ _ has terrible bedside manner and no personality, and I felt like his way of communicating with me was very condescending, which probably would've been tolerable if he had proven to be an excellent clinician, however, he accidentally tossed my nasal swab sample for COVID testing into the trash and so we had to do it again! What's worse is that, when he realized he had dropped it in the trash, he stood over it for about 5 seconds, hesitating to figure out what to do next, as if he was seriously considering reaching into the trash bin to retrieve it, and hoping I didn't catch what happened!! The next right professional thing to do is to say: "I'm so sorry we'll have to do this again", which he did eventually say this in his own way, but it was that moment of hesitation, hesitating to admit you're wrong in front of your patient and take the extra step to be reassuring, that bothered me. In fact, I actually tried to be cool about it, acknowledging that sometimes people just have bad days and make mistakes, but his manner was so terrible, I just can’t keep silent about this.<//Review>

I went today for the COVID-19 test for my mom. They said I need to make appointment where it was no appointment needed for the test on the their google page. And then I called the phone no they had on the google the answer you need to make appointment otherwise walk in have to Wait 4 hour and I was ready to wait I went inside to make sure then the receptionist told me I have to make appointment I can’t wait then I decided to leave didn’t make any appointment.  I was very disappointed... I don’t know why they post the no appointment needed.</review>

I truly appreciated all of the staff - kind, compassionate, and courteous. Also, the opportunity to make an appointment and register online was very convenient. Finally, the health care provider I met with was able to diagnose and prescribe medications that satisfied my need. Thank you.< /text>

Service was excellent. Reserved my place online so when I arrived check-in was a breeze. I was seen promptly by a very professional and knowledgeable doctor. I was there for a sensitive issue and she made me feel at ease. I will definitely be returning and have made this my go to place for the entire family. I M so glad I found this place.<//Review>

I had to go to here on Mother's day after my domestic house cat attacked me pretty bad. I was worried at first because of the "covid19 thing" but Im glad I went, to my surprise there was no other patients waiting, I was actually the only one.
The place was very clean, all staff had on masks and it felt safe. After checking in I was called within 10 minutes, the nurse was very nice she cleaned up my wounds then the doctor checked me out again he was very nice and understanding , then the nurse ,very gently cleaned me up and put bandages, I was given a shot and antibiotics amd was told to came back in 3 days for a check up.. I went 5 days later for a checkup with an appointment, this time it was very busy which made me a bit nervous but I checked in anyway and the front desk girl said I can wait in my car and when my turn is ready she will text me, I felt more comfortable that way. So it tiok 45 min for my turn, I went straight to the room and waited about 20 minutes for the doctor (a liitle too long to wait) he checked me out said everything looks nice.  I would come here again if I needed to.  👍<//Review>

Worst urgent care. 1. They don’t pickup the phone. 2. Bedside manner of doctors and PA are very rude. They don’t even listen to everything you have to say. Too much in a hurry to get you out with a new patient coming in. 3. They gave me a non-generic prescription that my pharmacy cannot fill. The pharmacy tried calling them for generic version and no one picked up the the phone. Had to drive back there and get an updated prescription. 4. Got a corona virus test. It’s been 8 days and still no test results. Since they don’t pick up the phone I have to drive there to find out what the test results are. If they even have the results. I keep checking Quest and the results are not there.<//text>

What a joke. This is NOT urgent care. This is make an appointment care. I went in and was basically told I’d be here for hours. People that had appointments an hour AFTER I arrived were seen before me and the other poor gentleman waiting without an appointment. So for you poor saps that think you can go into urgent care, think again and make an appointment or you are just s out of luck.< /Text>

Went there without my insurance Id card. They refused to help or verify eligibility with my health insurance. The guy at the counter didn't seem to care. He said their company policy does not allow them to see people without a health insurance  ID and they dont let him verify eligibility. So I truly don't know if he was just lazy or if it is a policy.</Review>

There’s always room for improvement however I am so happy with your services because of your app allowing patients to schedule appointments... many other urgent care facilities don't offer that service and it makes a huge difference when your waiting to be seen by a physician ... thank you for providing such innovation!< /Text>

I can't speak for the other locations but everything was amazing at the cerritos location. The waiting room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The air was nice as well as literally every staff member. I felt calm even though I was in a stressful situation. I really appreciate the community in there and will always be coming back when the need arises. :)<//Review>

Quick service, clean facility,
Not crowded, online scheduling is about accurate, the most I’ve waited is about 30min from my appt time, and waited 15-20 min the room for Dr.

Professional staff. I’ve seen two different doctors st this facility (make and female)
Both young and very professional. They take time to examine and discuss your matter.</review>

Are you the front desk person or the marketing/logistics person? After sometime he finally came to the front desk and started to help me out...in general not an efficient, customer friendly experience at this place.

Excellent. Made an online appointment. No waiting, got right in . Chris the Nurse is awesome. Just seeing his smiling face makes me begin to feel better !! Dr. Sumabat saw me right away. Knew exactly what was wrong and exactly how to treat it. Now 2 days later I am feeling MUCH better. Facility is IMMACULATE and very modern and comfortable. Front desk lady was also wonderful. Thank you Cerritos MedPost !!<//text>

I was a walk-in and had to wait 2-hours to get my vitals taken, plus an additional 30mins to be seen by the PA. I was unaware that one could schedule an appointment for an urgent care visit (unheard of), it would've been great if the "medical professional" who answered my call the night prior had mentioned this since I indicated my intent to visit them. Instead of seeing patients who were in pain and in real need of medical care, they tended to people who needed lab work for employers. Staff just didn't seem to care about the patients.</Review>

First time here and the attention from the medical staff was excellent. Clean and big waiting room and bathroom. Not too long to wait. Electronic registration. They took my vitals and took care of my problem right away. Very professional and straight to the point. Gave me clear instructions and asked me to follow up with my Dr the next day. Also you can either make an online appmt or walk in. They get you in quick either way. I will definitely recommend this place for medical attn to everyone when they need it. 👍 5*<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Everybody was very friendly and nice. I have been to many doctors offices and never have I met a staff this friendly. Secondly, I loved how clean the whole place was. Lastly, the doctor was very knowledgeable and very reasuring.
Only 2 down parts was that it cost $129 to see the doctor, but it is worth it because they have access to a lab. Secondly, the lab charges are seperate so they will cost extra. The wait time was standard for any Urgent Care. One and a half hour to two hours wait.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I went in on a Sunday, waited over 2 hrs and still wasn't even close to being seen.  They said they had a lot of appointments.  What is the point of having an Urgent Care on a weekend if you are just going to run it like a Monday-friday doctors office!!  They also have "call-ahead" where you can reserve your spot.  I had called earlier to make sure they took my insurance and was never told that was an option.  As we all sat in the waiting room for hours, you could hear the staff hanging out, laughing & talking about going out on Saturday night.  Then the guy at the front desk kept leaving for 10-15 minutes.  All their pamphlets say excellent customer service, LOL, definitely NOT!!  I have been to many urgent cares and it shouldn't take 5 hours to be seen & discharged!< /review><user_name>Marie Miranda<//user_name><date>1513548947301< /date><pics>None< /pics><userid>110131411640933122769< /userid><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Not sure. I came in with a issue and was asked to go see my primary doctor. My primary physician prescribed me medication for my dizziness and flonase for my swollen nasal passages.. hopefully the Bloodwork your staff did will come back with answers to my problems.< /Review>

worst experience ever.  I scheduled an appointment with them, gave my insurance information over the phone. Reached before time, gave my insurance card and filled in the registration form. They made me wait for 2 hours and then after that they claimed they don't accept HMO plans. I had pre-authorization from my Insurance company to visit any Urgent Care and my insurance company did confirm this to the provider over the phone & fax that they will cover all the claims as I needed urgent medical attention for toe which got cut by a blade.  Moreover the admin at the reception did confirm the doc will see me after.  But later when he found that my existing PCP was their competitor he decided to send me back.

After 2 hours of pain I was asked by the doc to leave and when I asked for justification she threatened to call the cops and got me arrested.< /Text>

What i liked was the quiet enviroment , not too crowded, the Ipad tegistration was different :) the front desk staff were really nice , and if its busy, an appointment could be set for you, so that you dont have to sit and wait , you can leave and come back .. my experience was really good, oh... and the doctor I had was informative.</text>

<Review>Went in on a weekday and it was not busy.  The doctor that saw me didn't introduce herself and just came in telling me "so you have a sore throat?" and told me to take advil and wait it out without even actually seeing me.

Worst experience and got rushed out.   The doctor didn't seem interested at all in what I could have...just got rushed out after waiting over an hour ...< /Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

I'm not sure if it's her name but it's on my receipt. Danica was very friendly. Answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. She definitely added to the fun one has at a sex store. Great customer service, will be coming back for more ;)</Text>

Edit 3/2: I received a call about my previous complaint and was offered a refund from the manager Horia. He told me to call him once I was in town. I did but when I called I found out he was no longer with the company nor would the company accept my return I was also hung up on.

WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS STORE!

This store has a poor selection of items for men. The items I bought were made very cheaply and do not fit properly. I went to the store to return or exchange the unopened items I did not wear.

The cashier had conflicting statements about the return policy. She claimed they were not accepting returns due to Covid-19 then she claimed she couldn’t return because i was not provided the itemized receipt then she made the statement about a sign posted below the counter. I had asked for a manager due to the conflicting statements made by the cashier.

Once the manager came she was very unhelpful and unprofessional, she offered no solutions but to contact corporate office. She gave me the number to corporate with no name or extension to dial. I will NEVER buy anything from this store again.< /review>

<text>Today I walked in unsure of what I really wanted until I saw the kegel weights and wasn't confident which was best for me and also wasn't interested in spending too much on something I might not use often. I wish I remembered the woman's name because she was so helpful in explaining the difference between the more affordable ones that were actually my favorite brand vs the ones that cost a little more but had variety and were potentially more comfortable based on the design. She didn't push me to spend more and I nearly bought the cheaper ones but then I was like.. no she's right. I took her recommendation because I'd rather spend more and be happy with my purchase. She really helped me make an informed purchase. I also appreciate how I was able to walk around the entire store from start to finish before she approached me again. Perfect customer service!</text></record></dataset><record>

Director John Waters once said "Sex is better when you're Catholic, because it's dirtier." The same idea was adopted by the porn industry ages ago. It's also what's killing the porn industry and making businesses or artists that even mention sex, often to be considered pornographic. Case in point, Hustlers' lingerie shop in the heart of Hollywood on Hollywood boulevard. Well, it's a little far from the heart...also far from similar shops. Anyway, stuff here is so expensive, and the selections aren't top notch: for boots and shoes: Pleasers. That's another thing: according to Hustler, if you wear boots and have sex, it's some kind of kinky B&D thing. I get the feeling that every garment at this shop should be restricted to indoors, which makes dating awkward. Besides clothing, there's a selection of pricey "toys" and lubes, some literature and accessories. Victoria's Secret and SI Swimsuit models look pretty big nowadays.  Basically, buying at the Hustler shop, you're buying into Hustler's viewpoint on sex.<//Review>

Staff was very helpful. Changing rooms were large. There was a nice selection of lingerie, costumes, dance dresses, kinky gear, toys, and more. Definitely worth a stop in.< /Text>

I like this store and their products but I wasn't  happy with my purchase. I ask someone for a specific item and they told me that it was more powerful than the other one. I couldn't test because it was sealed. Went home and test it and was not happy. I wasted 30 bucks on something I don't like. Not good Customer service.</text>

The door alarm went off twice as I left the store. The staff should have checked more thoroughly because a sensor was still attached to the dress I bought. I had to take her another Lyft to go have it removed the next day. Which means I had to spend an extra approx $60 on Lyfts since its far from my home. I couldve bought another dress for that money.
They gave me a 20% off coupon in return which doesnt really make up for the cost and hassle.
I like to get things done right the first time.
The customer service can use improvement, their attitude felt like pity. It didn't feel like they cared, it felt I was laughed at or pitied. It didnt feel like they really supported me. It felt like they wanted to see me fail.
The bags say in red "hustler" which seems too overt, so I was embarrased. I prefer privacy in my purchases especially around erotica. I met a man walking down the street and he laughed at the bag too.
Lastly, one of the staff approached me and made an offhand remark about how he was like a 'kid' when it came to the merchandise-I was standing next to the vibrators examining them at that moment . I didn't like his mixing sexual merchandise with the idea of being a kid, it felt inappropriate. When dealing with the erotic and the sexual we should be 'men' and 'women' - not 'boys' and 'girls' - we are to be adults, not children and when we engage in these activities and using the proper language I think will help increase a sense of responsibility for oneself and for others which seems to be a positive attribute when we are involved in sex.< /text>

Played some scratchers and won good . The man working had just hired a person and there was a good vibe. Keep smiling and being kind to others.  Let's all just do more of that. Thank you.<//Text>

<Text>Great selection, prices and hours. Owner is awesome. Has fish tank with cool fish. Although, been going here for years and one of the new clerks is never friendly or happy or something. I mean life's too short, could it hurt to crack a smile at least once. No restroom.<//Text><username>Sean<//username><Rate>4<//Rate>< Response>

< Review>
This is a cool Ass liquor store. One of the guys that works here used to be my neighbor! They got literally... an Odyssey of liquor that would make a drink Odysseus faint! It's next tho the Executive Suite which is a gay/lesbian transgender nightclub which is kinda cool because, after all... This is Long Beach! :) They got some hats scratchers and blunts and beers... That's mostly what I come there for.< /Review>

We had to deal with a Jacqueline Tiznado, totally unprofessional, did not care about the case, she seemed to only care about getting her money. We had to do most of the work for her, she didn’t even know when her clients court hearing was, tried little to no effort about building a case, was difficult to get a hold off, rude, discourteous; don’t waste your money here.</text>

< Review>
If I could give a 0 I would. Just wow, is all I'm going to say. First off, the telephone appointment I had was at 6 they called me at 6:17 to you know get my card info to pay. Luckily my sister has/had a case there so they didn't charge me the $60 for consultation fee.  The receptionist let me know I would get a call shortly.. 30 minutes later at 6:50, they call and some guy named Albert/Gilbert whatever the name was, was the one "consulting" me. Call was very brief didn't really ask me anything just the obvious questions about applying for citizenship, (time frame/price) meanwhile eating or idk maybe has a lisp and kept sounding like he had stuff in his mouth. when I asked if he would be able To assist in sponsoring my parents when becoming a citizen he didn't want to speak to me just told me to tell my parent to go in office to speak about that. I let him know that they already went and we're advised to have me go with them. I explained I can't call off work it's very hard. Told me they didn't need me, to just have my parents go AGAIN for an appt. Told him again well why would they advise them in the first place to have me call? Continued to cut me and my sister off and advise my parents come in. Sure they won't charge them but I'm not sure why my parents would go in again? Maybe to talk about the SAME things? Who knows. Also, my sister mentioned her case has the petition they were asking and this guy Albert said he couldn't look for it because he had nothing to write her name down lol. What kind of professional doesn't have a pen and paper to write down client info? I wonder what excuse they'll come up with my review, since they either say they have no idea who most of these "clients" are or to "call" them. Anywho, yeah to all the people complaining they they're not helping them. Just take it to the BBB. Also, like I said. I'm so glad I didn't waste $60 on a 10 minute "consultation" lol. there's a lot of good lawyers out there just look at their reviews on google and yelp. I only went because my sister went . But looking at their reviews... I would not have gone here ._. You live and you learn.

Rudolph replied to my review on yelp which you can go see and this is my reply:

In response to Rudolph's reply:
To correct you, the call lasted 11 minutes. I have my call log if you want a copy of it. Not sure where the extra 9 minutes came from? Secondly I did hear you in the background and am very ashamed of you that you allowed a behavior such as your trainee which I'm assuming has to be a trainee since he was very rude and unprofessional. 3) And yes, I am too busy to go to a "law firm" that the assistant/ trainee was eating while speaking to me and cutting me off. I had an immigration lawyer that was 40 minutes away and I would constantly make the drive since they were a RESPECTFUL, TRUSTWORTHY, and PROFESSIONAL company. Unfortunately the attorney passed and I am forced to find another immigration attorney. And trust me when I say, this location would be not be an option. I can make the drive to a place I trust and unfortunately this is not it. Rudolph just confirmed this as he lied and stated he was on the call for 20 minutes. My parents also obviously can make the drive but not to a "law firm" as this. There’s a difference between can’t make time or choosing not to. Lastly, I can definitely agree with you as your 3 star reviews show you are a trust worthy and "top notch" immigration law firm. Again, to all potential clients. Please do your research, look at google and yelp reviews before choosing just any attorney to handle your case. Also, complain to the BBB if your case is not handled. I don't want another false statement, so no reply would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</Review>

HI James,
I guess you know this already but I left you multiple voice mail messages as I called you directly and through your office staff, I know you must have received and ignored my continued requests for your insight and expertise. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL You have refused to return my calls. You mentioned in your ads "Pay the consultation fee and you have an attorney for life" Well where was that attorney that I paid my consultation fee at? When I needed guidance and insight on how to proceed and navigate through Immigration processes. You have betrayed and violated basic but elemental human and business decency. It would be nice if your clients were as important to you as the money your charge for your services. I am very disappointed in your inability to return a simple phone call. Your staff is also very unhelpful.<//text>

I had a great experience at R B and Associates.  I entered the office with hesitation, not knowing what to expect. I was promptly greeted and explained what could be done to help my case.  I was given a few options, other attorneys had only given me one option.  The attorney was able to answer all my questions and give her advice.   The attorney general as well versed and very knowledgeable.  Thanks Rudolph Baker and Associates, you really helped me out and it is because of your awesome attorneys that I was able to get a favorable outcome of my case!<//Text>

I haven’t gotten any service from this people but from reading all the reviews his basic answer for every negative post is “I don’t have you on my clients data base” and some responsive that are outright unprofessional, Not so many people can’t be wrong about their experience with this lawyers, I just wanted to give my opinion, guess I have to keep on looking elsewhere.</Review>

Bad experience and terrible service totally unprofessional. I visit there office in Tijuana to help me on a TN visa and my boss and me was assured by the lawyer that I will have it after they worked on it. The result it was denied by the consulate. Me and my boss  called several times the lawyers direct number, cell number and office number plus Emails to and did not answer until 2 days later. I went to their office with the information they requested and the consulate provided and was told that they will appeal or do something else but nothing ever happened for a month and 1/2 and we  (Me and my boss )called again several times but could never reach the lawyer even by Email. Totally disappointing I expected much more professionalism and commitment from you to us. Would never recommend!!!<//text>

At the initial consultation they seem great and really sell their firm. My parents agreed to start their immigration case with them. HOWEVER we had to go back and fourth, three different times because they never mentioned ALL the paperwork needed from the affidavit of support my parents needed. We finally managed to take everything needed to submit the paper work; we thought everything was ok. A week later I ask my mom to call in and get the confirmation that they did indeed filled the paperwork, guess what they never did. Aldo, the guy that was filling the paperwork, was on vacation. Ok lets give them the benefit of the doubt. I call again to see if they've finally filled the paperwork, Aldo is too busy to give me a call back, or anyone else in that office. OVERALL they seem unorganized, if they can’t keep track of their clients paperwork don't take more cases. For my immigration case (at a different firm) they gave me a complete list of EVERYTHING I needed, once I managed to gather everything, I went in once, and the next day the lawyer sent me an email that my paperwork had been filed, with the same exact price as Baker and Associates.< /Text>

Ultimately they got the job done.  But many of the problems were due to the individual in Tijuana that did not listen to the issues we were experiencing.  Finally after a long time we changed to the other office which got us back on track.  Adam and staff were great.  The main problem with the San Diego office is the lack of returnings calls if it doesn't involve makink payments.  Currently l have been leaving messages because I need back original documents and I do not get back a call after leaving numerous messages.  So I will have to travel to the San Diego office to make my request in person.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I want to thank Alberto Trujillo because he behaved in a professional way when he attended me and answered my question. I put a star for YESENIA ORTIZ's arrogant way of scheduling my date, we are adults and there are ways of talking. He told me that they did not attend to people with my situation and that they could not help me. Now I went to Alberto Trujillo and he told me the best option to proceed. People who need information talk to the lawyers and not the receptionists because they may get discouraged and not follow through with their situation. Check in with the lawyers and make appointments with the receptionists. Each one his place and we all win.

(Original)
Quiero agradecer a Alberto Trujillo porque se porto de una forma profesional al atenderme y contestar mi pregunta. Pongo una estrella por la forma prepotente de YESENIA ORTIZ de como agendo mi cita somos adultos y hay formas de hablar. Me dijo que ellos no atendian personas con mi situacion y que no me podian ayudar. Ahora fui con Alberto Trujillo y me dijo la mejor opcion para proceder. Gente que necesite informacion hablen con los abogados y no las recepcionistas porque puede que se desanimen y no prosigan con su situacion. Informense con los abogados y agenden citas con las recepcionistas. Cada quien su lugar y todos ganamos.<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Please, if you are about to hire oh, you are looking for a lawyer, think about it very well before hiring with this office, they just steal you and they do absolutely nothing. Attorney Tina Malek is late ah the courts never show up to talk to the detainee and at the office you they say they will
First you find out what happened in the courts because your relative talks to you because they don't do it until they want and wash their hands
Be careful, please, because it is not fair to take advantage of people's despair and need.
A good lawyer defends you does not give you and tells you better sign the voluntary exit because if that were not we would seek help
PLEASE CARE

Por favor si usted esta por contratar oh esta buscando abogado piénselo muy bien antes de contratar con esta oficina solo te roban y no hacen absolutamente nada la abogada Tina Malek llega tarde ah las cortes nunca se presenta para hablar con el detenido y en la oficina te dicen que si lo harán
Primero te enteras de lo que paso en las cortes porque tu familiar te habla porque ellos no lo hacen hasta que quieren y se lavan sus manos
Tengan cuidado por favor porque no es justo que se aprovechen así de la desesperación y la necesidad de las personas
Un buen abogado te defiende no te entrega y te dice mejor firma la salida voluntaria porque si eso fuera no buscaríamos ayuda

Mi caso fue muy complicado y duró mas de 10 años porque el gobierno no quería reconocer su error administrativo. Con James y su equipo siempre tuve la seguridad de que estaban muy atentos en mi caso y que hicieron todo lo posible por solucionarlo. Siempre fueron muy claros en explicarme bien cuáles eran las posibilidades y eso me hizo sentir confianza en su capacidad e integridad. En ningún momento se me dieron ilusiones falsas y por eso es que siempre recomiendo a James y su equipo siempre que hay oportunidad. Como inmigrante, he escuchado decenas de historias en donde abogados se aprovechan de la comunidad o les cobran carísimo por trámites sencillos. He hecho varias recomendaciones con mis propias amistades y tanto el trato como sus esfuerzos hacia obtener buenos resultados han sido igual a los míos. En este tipo de proceso, la dignidad del cliente es muy importante y confío plenamente en James y todo su equipo. Por mi parte, yo seguiré apoyándolos porque así también ayudo a mi comunidad. ¡Gracias Jaime!

(Translated by Google) They are incompetent lawyers if I do not call or find out that my mother has an appointment when she supposedly had her package ready they call to go and collect it not that there is another paper missing then for the hell they say that everything is ready three days after the appointment and even the package It is incomplete, perhaps they do not know what requirements they need, oh, even if they look at the package, I have to travel by train, annoying the endorsement every time, I am so disappointed with these lawyers, if they have the opportunity, look for others, even if they pay dearly, but do not bring them from their asshole like me.

(Translated by Google) Most dishonest, I contacted them approximately 8 months, they charged me 500 dlls to go see me which Daniel C. appeared and after that I never showed up to my court, my wife showed up at the office because by impossible phone and they assigned me another lawyer I don't remember her name well, I think Tina or something so arrogant and rude which I charge another 1000 dlls and in the afternoon my wife received a call "her husband does not qualify for bail will be deported" but as if they never defended me they never showed up court ... long counting never received a refund of money. contact another lawyer and here I am ... careful countrymen we pay not them ... thanks look well and there are many immigration cases of this office and it is the same believe me ... simple comment. I clarify, James never shows up to your court, they assign you another lawyer ... nor answer calls

(Translated by Google) WARNING !!!!! WARNING !!! This firm only steals your money, they take advantage of the need of the people, they charge you for the consultation $ 60.00 the one who attends you is James, who assures you that if he can take your case, maybe 60 people arrive a day, when they ask you an advance to open your case is $ 500.00, you call, leave a message, they tell you that they will call you, NEVER RETURN THE CALL TO YOU OR LESS THAN THEY INDICATE THAT THEY ARE MAKING THEM TO KNOW YOUR FAMILY. I will send my complaint to the LAWYERS BAR, so they can take action on the matter, and they can suspend their license. BURGLARS!!!!!!!!

Went in for an oil change and had let them know what oil viscosity to use recommended by the owners manual which is 5w-20 without towing package which is the one i use yet they decided to put in 5w-30 but when I tried to explain to him the guy just kept saying "no no that's not right look under hood" i even let him know prior to going in all he said was "yes yes ok" so that's a red flag they didn't even check the air filter yet they marked as if they did deflated two front tires below the required psi this place was just a mess for being a second time customer.</Text>

<Review>Very honest service. Took my Jeep for tire rotation and break pads replacement. Break pads didn’t need replacement - they didn’t charge for tire rotation either even though they did the service. I always have my oil changes here, they’re fast.

<review>Lube Masters is a great business to get your oil change. They are a small family owned business. I love going here, they aren't like a chain big business  which makes you feel like you are just another car. My mom has been going here for many many years. She has taken a few of her vehicles there for maintenance too which Bill did an excellent job. I highly recommend Lube Masters.< /review><time>1593715823400</time>< Pictures>

<Review>I came on a Saturday just to find from a rude younger attendant that I needed an appointment. Then I asked nicely if they could do it now, because there was no one there and I came all the way from Azusa. He replied "you need an appointment" "what if I do not have your transmition oil?" I replied . you do not have transmition oil for a Corolla 2009? He said No. Then I said why are you treating me like if I came to steal something from you? I came to have my carcserviced. The he replied "you need an appointment" At that time I started to lose patience and said "forget it" I'll rather go somewhere else and pay extra than having to see your face again. Too bad because Bill, the owner, is such a gentleman and my family have their cars serviced here. Thank you Bill for all of your kindness and fair prices, but even thou my family will continue to come here, I,m afraid I will prefer to be treated in a different way.< /Review>< gmap_id>

I have to be honest about this place, even though I still take my older cars there. Two years ago one of their employees forgot to tighten the oil pan nut. As a result I blew my engine in Arizona. Owners paid for a new engine. I took a chance the other day and took the car that suffered the blown engine to get an oil change. I caught an employee cutting with a knife, the cardboard like cover that protects the underside of the engine area, to get to the oil pan. DON'T take your new car there.< /text>

No frills lube shop. All the guys are friendly, very efficient, always do good work and check all the fluids tire pressure etc etc. Lines can be long, but they work through it pretty quick. Half the cost of Jiffy Lube. They don't vaccuum your floors, but I think that's worth 50% less. They never try to upsell, just let you know if they come across anything. I drive 15 miles to get my oil changed here. Every time.< /Review>

These guys are always friendly and efficient. No frills, but then there's no up-selling. Every time I would go to a franchise oil change businesses they would always come into the waiting room and say "Sir can you come out to your car for a moment. We've noticed something." "NO I don't want my radiator flushed. Thanks." That doesn't happen here.</text>

<review>I've been bringing my cars here for - good grief - decades, I guess! Even though I now live in Reseda, and there are lots of oil change places within half a block, I snub them all and make the trek to Eagle Rock. They always do a great job and the prices are CRAZY low!! Plus they will never EVER try to sell you services you don't want or need. On the few occasions they've advised me to have a repair done, I do, because they've proven to be trustworthy. Go!!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Older man working there i beleve his name is ed is rude..i asked to use the bathroom and he said yes..when vehicle was done with oilchange he gave back the keys then called me a pig and said to dont pee outside the toilet...guy probably needs to retire  with that kind of attitude  and respect he gives towards his customer...whole place needs a remodel ..there was also no waiting area only had chairs outside in the parking lot and is dangerous...horrible experience</review><rating>1<//rating>< GmapID>

10/10. Follows COVID guidelines and has a variety of artists that is sure to make you blow your savings account. I highly recommend this experience to anyone and everyone. (Just beware of the homeless people in the area!!!)<//Text>

I could easily spend an hour or two browsing for vinyl. The owner, Caleb, is great to chat about music with and can always help me find what I need or let me know if he can order it! I love recommending Normal Records to friends because it's a great shop with a good variety of new and used records, cds,  45sand cassette tapes. My boyfriend and I always make it a point to pop in when we can. Support your local record shop!<//review>< Pictures>

It's a nice place to go for vinyls. It's a small place but the variety of artists makes up for it. There is relaxing music in the background while you are looking for artists. I walk in expecting to walk out with 1or 2 vinyls but I ended up buying 5 vinyls and a poster<//Review>

Been here a few times and I never leave without a great find! Records divided nicely into genre. The owner is knowledgeable and helpful. Not your snooty record store type ala High Fidelity...
I'll be coming back whenever I'm in North Park.
P.s. being right next to Belching Beaver doesn't hurt either  ;)<//review>

Def a must visit if you are in San Diego. Shop is clean and well organized - incredibly easy and comfortable to dig thru the selection. Caleb (hope I spelled that correct) was really friendly and even kind enough to share some tunes he was currently on the hunt for. 10/10 would 100% shop there again.< /Review>

Edit 2/4/2020 that final statement has changed, as he is located in downtown.  Parking can be limited, try sounding blocks.  Worst case scenario,  park in the Albertsons parking lot. (They RARELY tow)< /Text><UserId.>117415132713584735716< /UserId.></record>

This review is long overdue, but this is one of my favorite record stores of all time. Despite having a cool store and being clearly superior in his knowledge about music, the owner is extremely approachable, patient, friendly, and generally gives a sh*t about music, especially at the local level — he is generous in allowing local bands/music acts gig inside the store space after hours from time to time, which is invaluable to the community.

Great selection of punk/rock/indie records, as well as interesting finds (once there were Charlie Brown Christmas albums). They also have some rare variants on the walls for serious collectors (sometimes rare records are posted on their Instagram as it is stocked so keep an eye out)! Nowadays, there are many record shops that don’t offer much beyond what perusing discogs can offer, with a bland, snotty, nonchalant clerk behind the counter, but Normal Records is not that. Visiting this place is a completely immersive experience and makes supporting your local/leaving the house worth it.</review>

<text>Looks like this place has moved locations recently. Small store footprint but big on selection and variety. More new records than used, but the used records are typically ones that are harder to find and in good condition. Worth the stop.< /text>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><review>This park is a pretty adorable little oasis in an area of town that isn't the greatest. I came across it by accident, after following incorrect directions. My companion and I decided this would be a good place to stop for a few minutes to figure out where we were going. We hung out for a while, just to enjoy the day, since we were there already anyway.
The park appeared to be clean, and pretty well kept, with lots of green grass. There were a lot of people out enjoying the sunshine🌞with family and friends. Overall, it seemed to me to be a great place to go for the kids🤸 to play, the dog🐕to run around (on a leash, of course😜) have a picnic🌭🍉, fly a kite🪁, ride a bike🚲, etc etc.. you get it! Sky's the limit!< /review>< pictures>

I usually love this place! On this particular day their were big ants crawling every where. ONCE I seen one on my kid it was time to go. Otherwise a good park to go. Plenty of parking. And the ice cream trucks frequently come by!</Review>

There are homeless people everywhere and the equipment is in disrepair...I almost broke my leg on the lily pad obstacle because it was hanging loose...beware.  Could be made better if anyone cared.</Review>

This park is great for football practice this is Sacramento Ducks practice field all the kids enjoy going to this park, it's centrally located in South SACRAMENTO. Down side is the bathrooms they are very dated and always have homeless occupying them.< /text>

Found my wedding dress here in September last year and Dora (or Doris?) Was so helpful and nice. She was super patient and knew exactly what to do to help me feel comfortable finding and choosing a dress. Came again today and Camryne helped us choose a dress for one of my bridesmaids. She was also so kind and helpful. Overall the customer service is great here and they make the process as stress free as possible. Will be coming again soon with the rest of my bridal party.</review>

Going in was nerve wrecking but Brittany was such a great help!! While trying on my dresses, she encouraged me to tell her my dislikes and likes about each dress fitting. While trying on my fourth dress, I thought about how I may need to look at a different location until Brittany brought out a fifth dress and I fell in love with her choice. She kept in mind of what I liked about the previous dresses and chose the final one! As soon as I put on the final dress, I knew it was the one. Again! Brittany is amazing 👏 I went in to look only for a dress and came out with a dress, a veil, and a cute belt. I am so glad I had Brittany helping me out.< /review>

I had such a wonderful experience at the David’s Bridal in the Long Beach town center this last Saturday. As a plus size bride I was trying to prepare myself for nothing fitting and a limited selection but nothing could be farther from the truth. I call ahead to see it a dress I had seen on the site was in stock and they held it for me. The selection was fantastic, all of the staff especially my stylist was so awesome. They made me feel special helped me get pictures. I found the dress of my dreams for a great price. We will be go back for my bridesmaid and MOH.< /Text>

First off, I made my appointment online for the LB location and for some reason (web related?) the appointment never got in their books. They were cool enough to accommodate me anyway on a Saturday afternoon.

Teresa was my stylist. She printed out my favorites and brought out 7 dresses that were either on my list or were in the style of the dresses on my list that they had in inventory. The dress I ended up getting wasn't in my favorites originally, but she had a gut feeling and it turned out to be the best fit and was in the budget I told her. She recommended everything from undergarments to accessories. She was easy going and took great care of me, my mom, and my fiance.

I've had a neutral experience with that David's Bridal so far, but Teresa was amazing. Truly a gem there!</Review>

<review>Great experience here at David's Bridal. My stylist was knowledgeable, confident, and helpful. Only had to try a few dresses and found the one. It was helpful that they have all the sizes of wedding dresses to try and they provide under garments to get a good idea of the dress fit. Great experience overall.<//review>< Date>

Booking an appointment online for a wedding dress was simple, and they sent a reminder email before the appointment as well. Initially, I was a bit overwhelmed with all the dresses, but stylist, Savannah, was able to help me with finding my size and dresses in my budget. After trying on a few dresses, Savannah pulled a beautiful V-neck ball gown! It was slightly above my budget, but it was on sale and was such a deal. Plus it was already in my size! My entire party also loved the dress as well. I felt comfortable and taken care of the entire time. I was so happy to have found my dress here! Thank you Savannah and team for making my first and last wedding dress shopping experience pleasureable and fun!< /review>

<review>Idk about All David's Bridal Wedding Dresses around the states but this was my 1st and only experience trying on and looking for a Wedding Dresses and let me tell you there was absolutely no need to shop around or look any further.

I never fully understood the statement when you know you know concept until tonight.

Savanah not only helped me find my Wedding ceremony dress but an additional wedding dress which I can wear for the rehearsal, and/or reception.

She said we made her night but this memory will last a lifetime for me.

She not only met my expectations she supersede them 😁😊🧡🧡< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1622269563079, 'text': "Your kind words mean so much to us! We are truly thrilled that you chose us for your journey !! Best, David's Bridal"}</resp>< Gmap_id>

I came back to exchange my bridesmaids dress because I go pregnant 1 month before the wedding and the dress I had purchased 5 months prior did not fit me!

Jillian helped me find a dress that was available in the original color we selected and also accommodated a growing baby bump.
No hassle and I was out of there in a flash.<//text>< Pictures>

I had the BEST experience choosing my wedding dress at the Long Beach (by Carson St.) David’s Bridal, and it all was because of Sarah B! Sarah was beyond kind and caring! She always gave the appointments the time they needed (even if they went over a bit) and never let me feel rushed. Even though I made a couple of appointments with Sarah to find my dream dress, she always made it clear that she wanted me to feel happy, excited, and sure about my dress. When I finally choose my dress with her, all of the staff at the Long Beach David’s Bridal were so kind! I HIGHLY recommend getting your wedding dress from this location, especially with Sarah!! Not only is she a sweet and kind person, but she is a extremely talented stylist! I would call her the queen of clipping, because no matter the size of the dress, she made all dresses look amazing! She also had amazing ideas for alterations for dresses that I had doubts about. David’s Bridal, you truly have a gem with Sarah! If you are looking for your wedding dress and you want to have an experience similar to mine (which was a truly special and memorable one) ask for Sarah B.! She will not disappoint! If there were an option to give her ten stars, I would give Sarah B. a million!</Text>

<Text>Very good service. Upon arrival we were greeted and sanitized our hands due to the ongoing pandemic. Very few people in the store because it’s by appointment only. My stylist was running behind with another bridal appointment so Dahlia ended up servicing me and was very helpful and brought the bridesmaid dress I needed. I was in and out in about 30 min which was great because I had my 5 yr old with me. She was very sweet and extremely helpful.<//Text>< pictures>

I needed a grandmother of the groom dress that had to be modest... In other words to the neck, below the elbows, no see through lace.  While the dress fit most specifications, it had an open back.  Their alterations person is amazing and the sales girl was patient with my needs.  Prices reasonable.<//Review>

BRIDES! If you are looking for an amazing dress experience, go here and ask for Andrea!!! This is the second David’s Bridal I’ve been to and it’s so far beyond compare of the other one. From the minute I walked in, it had a totally different energy, you could tell the stylists were really locked into their bride and listening to everything they were looking for.

I was helped by Andrea and she was a DREAM!! She listened to everything I was looking for and picked out some amazing dresses to try. She got me fitted in undergarments too and brought me shoes and a veil (all are things I didn’t realize the other location didn’t do until now and it made it more helpful to really picture my big day in each outfit). I can’t recommend her enough!!! She helped find my dream dress and took pictures and videos to send to my family/friends. I also received help from Jocelyn who was so helpful and friendly as well.

Definitely go here if you’re looking for amazing service and really affordable dresses!!</Review>

I came in feeling hopeless because I was 2 days away from having my civil wedding, I’m pregnant and just didn’t feel like shopping !! I came in with very specific details of what I wanted.  Savannah was very patient with me, encouraged me to try a different style from what I wanted but at the same honor my wishes and became very creative in putting a wedding dress together.  I would have never gone for the style she picked up but it was very flattering on my body.  She added a few accessories that pull the outfit together. I was so happy to have found something to wear that I’m actually very comfortable in snd it looks beautiful!! Again, thank you very much for all your help Savannah and really taking the time to get me out of my head and into a beautiful dress.  Forever grateful

Terrible experience! In an effort to obtain the sale, the representative blatantly lied and advised me that alterations were included in my purchase. She advised me the only additional cost would be 40-60 dollars to expedite my processing time to have my dress available. After purchasing my gown, I returned today to adhere to my alterations appointment where I was blindsided by an additional charge of $300 for alterations. I requested to speak with a manager while I awaited the return of my dress. I waited for 30 minutes without the slightest form of acknowledgment. My maid of honor went to the back to check on the delay to only see the staff had not even started to remove   the pins from my dress. After she complained, they rushed through to remove pins, and return the dress. However, they clearly had better things to do because they left quite a few pins in the dress. Besides the lack of integrity from the sales rep, and the negligence of the reps servicing my dress, the greatest insult was the condescending and lack of ownership of the manager. She dismissed my concerns, insinuated I was lying, was extremely insensitive, and worst of all she never even offered offer an apology. She even tried coaching me on my terminology, stating “You keep saying lying, and that's not the correct term, you shouldn't say that". As she repeatedly told me, she wasn't there so she doesn't know. Also, I've never had a manager try and dictate my verbal expression, I was completely respectful and valid with communicating my undesirable experience. I'm extremely articulate and didn't need to be reprimanded by this manager, her lying sales rep did. There was another huge concern I witnessed when purchasing my wedding dress, and my five bridesmaid's dresses as well; we didn't get a bell or any other demonstrations of excitement or joy that I witnessed today. All of the women today had a dressing buying experience, they were assisted with putting on their dresses while I was advised they were unable to assist me because of covid restrictions. Guess those restrictions only pertained to me. I can't help but believe my poor service and lack of respect was racially charged. The preferential treatment I witnessed others receiving was nothing like my experience. The store it's self lacks diversity and it doesn't seem like that is by coincidence. I will be posting my experience on all social outlets in an effort to prevent others from having to going through this nightmare. I encourage additional training to be rendered to your staff on integrity as well as customer service.<//text>

I made an appointment for my first bridal dress fitting.  Had a wonderful experience.  Upon entering they carefully ask for you information offer hand sanitizer as you shop the inventory.  There are several options and they can alter any most anything you select to have features you want to make it your special dress.  The manager Ms. Andrea was a pleasure and made what could be a very anxious experience become a wonderful at ease and comfortable special moment to a very important purchase.  I look forward to my follow up appointment.  You will appreciate the discretion and  privacy plus they are there to help you get in and out of gowns with ease.  Overall a happy experience.  You get to try 5 dresses per appointment and I tried one 2x so it’s was really helpful!!!<//Review>

<text>Made a last minute appointment to look at bridesmaid dresses. Angela who helped us first was very friendly and knowledgeable. Then Sarah took over and helped us figure out which dresses we could get shipped to us in time for the wedding in September. Neither of them were pushy or trying to upsell us and were very caring and helpful in choosing the dresses that flatter and fit us! I'd highly recommend going to David's Bridal if you don't want to deal with the craziness of going to downtown LA or the iffy-ness of buying dresses online without seeing them in person.<//text>< Pictures>

After we checked into our appointment, we spent about 10 minutes just walking around and looking at the dresses without an attendant so we were a little lost. Once we met Savannah, our whole experience was amazing. She was very knowledgeable and friendly and made our experience so easy. We ended up finding a dress for one of my bridesmaids. Thank you again, Savannah!</Review>

< Review>
I will say going on a weekend was probably not the best idea for a first try on experience ever for a first time bride. The experience was not bad, but was not great. I feel like the bridal consultants are not given enough time to work with the brides. I was asked to do a survey upon booking and submit a link of my Pinterest board but it didn't seem like my consultant had any access to it. I proceeded to show her my board upon arrival to my appt. I will say she was nice but I felt very rushed the whole time. Again, probably not her fault. I do wish she may had been more helpful for a bride who really wanted the expert opinion of a consultant. I did ask to try on a specific gown which was not offered when given several dresses to try on. I actually forgot about it in the fumble of trying on like 6 dresses in 60 min. There is some fault of mine to being a bit late (8 min) to my appt, but then again I'm sure I'm not the first to be running late. When I tried on dresses there was no opportunity to see myself first in the dressing room before stepping out to a platform to show family/friends. Then I was immediately asked my opinion of the dress which was hard under pressure to give my thoughts on demand. I would not discourage going to David's Bridal, and I would say my consultant did the best she could given the time constraints. I didn't find my dress there nor did I have that emotional moment that you see on "say yes to the dress" of really falling in love with anything. But I do thank David's Bridal for helping get a little closer to knowing what I like and don't like for the next bridal appt. I book and go to.</Review>

It was my first time shopping for a Wedding event and it was for my Sister's upcoming wedding!!! I LOVED my experience at David's Bridal. Their team were prepared and took really good care of me! I also trusted their fashion opinion and felt at ease through it all. The dresses in stock were also FANTASTIC. I highly recommend!!<//Text>

My sister and I had such a wonderful experience at Davids Bridal in Long Beach Ca. My sister is the bride and she was a little hesitant on trying on dresses, but when we walked in we were greeted at the door and screened due to Covid-19. The team there is so wonderful and helpful. The taylor that assisted us was Keri and she was great. My sister had such a great experience and they made her feel so special as if she was the only one that mattered in the store. The ladies here really know what there doing and will definitely make your search for that special dress magical💖</text>

I was able to find my dress today thanks to Angela she actually picked the dress I chose to wear on my special day.

My wedding is in 30 days and the whole staff was accommodating and gracious. I definitely recommend David’s bridal for your one stop bridal shopping experience!<//review>

All the girls there were so nice and welcoming . Kellee at the long beach location was AMAZING! I told her what I wanted and she made it happen. My dress was amazing and even under budget. She never sold me on something expensive or anything I didn't like. Totally worth it! Thanks Davids bridal and the alteration ladies and an extra thanks to Kellee.</Text>

Angela is the best! She was so accommodating! I thought this was going to be such an overwhelming experience but she made it so easy and I was not stressed at all! She made everything simple while adverting to the COVID laws in our area. She is an extraordinary example of customer service and such a great representation of David’s Bridal.</review>

My stylist was Rylee and she was the best. This was the first dress shop I visited and the first wedding dresses I tried on. I was not expecting to find The Dress that day, but I did! The whole experience was great and my bridesmaids and I are going to go back to see Rylee to get their dresses<//Review>

I’m singing in a Jazz concert tonight and already had a nice dress but really wanted to take it over the top at an affordable price. I found a gorgeous velvet mermaid dress in Cinnamon and now I can’t decide if I’m more excited to sing in Beverly Hills or to wear the dress! Super thankful for my consultant, Connie. She was great!</text>

<Review>Me and my friend went here today to pick out a bridesmaids dress for her wedding. I had no clue what I wanted, kind of a broad color choice, and had never even worn a bridesmaid dress before. Lol
When we arrived for our appointment we were kindly greeted in the front and promptly taken care of.
When our associate, Catherine, came to help us- she was so sweet & guided us in the right direction for picking a dress. She was extremely helpful, and so knowledgeable about the different styles, fabrics, sizes, and process in general. She was so polite and made the whole experience so pleasant and fun!!!
Let’s just say, I had NO problem finding a dress with her as our associate, and ended up picking the PERFECT dress within the hour!!!!
I’ve heard about some unpleasant experiences at these appointments, but that is the OPPOSITE of what we experienced here with our associate, Cathrine, and the other staff at David’s Bridal LBTC.
OH, and my dress was on sale, which is just a cool bonus!! 😍
10/10 would absolutely buy from here again.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1602643729792, 'text': "Hi Jessica!

I had a wonderful, efficient experience at this store. Staff truly listened to me and my preference (style, budget) and did not push their own agenda. I felt like they were looking to make my special day very special, and my “yes to the dress” moment even more special.<//review>

Very beautiful and clean place that is following  protocols. Sabrina M. was my stylist and was amazing. She made me feel very comfortable and open with the options that I really liked and she was also knowledgeable about different styles and prices.
I bought my dress that same day, couldn’t have been a better experience.
Thank you!</review>

Had a wonderful Bridal Appointment at the Long Beach David's Bridal location. I was welcomed in immediately and was able to look at all the dresses for about 5 min before my consultant Sarah came over and introduced herself. She all ready had the list of dresses that I had Favorited on my online David's Bridal account. She also showed me around and pointed out new dresses that she thought I would love. Of course we tried on my favorite first and it was all over after that. I was able to try on 5-6 dresses. They provide undergarment bra and under skirt to try on with the dresses. They're very strict with wearing the mask at the store and the consultant cannot help put on the dresses. Make sure you bring someone who can help you get in and out of the dresses. The consultant can help at the end and help tie up and clip dress for show. My consultant Sarah was very attentive and showed me beautiful veils to pair with my dress. This location is super clean and everyone was friendly and helpful. I was surprised by the quality of the dresses, all were so beautiful and nice. I did say yes to the dress and I would highly recommend this location.</Text>

I felt like I was at a car dealership the first time I went, the person helping me was only interested in making be buy something. She didnt care what, she just wanted me to walk out with something purchased! I ended up making another appointment because I felt I was pressured into buying my dress and wasnt 100% happy with it! Gaby helped me out the 2nd time and she was awesome! No pressure at all and we found a dress I loved! I was a little disappointed when I picked up the dress and it was wrinkled they said they only steam them when you send the dress to alterations so I had to come home with a wrinkled dress and veil.< /Text>

Fast and professional service. The staff was very warm and communicative; they answered all of my questions and helped me milk over certain decisions. At the end, and I felt very confident that my wedding dress was going to look perfect once they were finished with the alterations.< /Review>

Sarah was amazing. She was very helpful and patient. I thought I knew what I wanted but she made a suggestion after I tried on some of the dresses I asked for and I ended up getting the dress she suggested. I am very happy with the dress, the fit was perfect and the color is beautiful!
Thank you!< /Review>

<text>I had wonderful experience today. I didn't think it was possible to find your wedding dress on the first shot, but today I was proved wrong. It is. Thanks to Fabiola she was so kind, gentle, and had lots of patience. She was the best. She made me feel comfortable and listened to everything I liked and wanted. And sure enough she helped me find the perfect dress for me. It's breath taking. Thank you David's bridal and most of all thank you to Fabiola for helping me find my  dream dress. 💕</text><rate>5</rate></record>

I had such an amazing experience thanks to Fabiola! She is absolutely wonderful! Picked out exactly what I was in to, listened to me and responded to my wants and feedback, and she was so friendly and helpful. The appointment went by so fast but I was able to try on so many different dresses because she was so efficient. She picked out dresses for me I ended up loving but hadn't picked out for myself. She was so perfect and so professional while also making me feel totally comfortable.<//review>

<review>I have been to various David’s bridals in the last few years for about 9 weddings. This time it was for my own wedding, and I lucked out at the Long Beach location. Julian A. was the best stylist I have ever worked with and he not only helped me find a great dress, but let my personality show through it. I could not believe how knowledgeable he was about the dresses, but also he knew what would look good on my body type and what I wanted and found where the two met. And to top it off he was an extreme pleasure to work with. I can’t wait to come back to David’s Bridal for the next wedding I am a part of.<//review>< name>

< Review>
Selling floor: Clean, and organized. Not a lot of wandering customers, which feels like they're fairly attentive. It did seem more spacious than a previous David's Bridal I've been to.

Consultant: Sarah. She was great! I had given her a list of dresses I wanted to try on and kept me well-informed on stock, sizing, and possible alterations I could make if I wanted to. What made her great though is how she seemed to take in a lot of my opinions on each dress and eventually helped me find the correct one! She didn't rush me and make me feel pressured to buy a dress that day or any accessories.

Overall: Amazing experience. I felt very taken care of and listened to, which ultimately is what I would want as a bride. Thank you, Sarah!<//Review>

<Review>This was my first wedding dress shopping experience and it was wonderful! I didn’t pick a dress, but tried on several beautiful ones. My salesperson was Doris, and she was wonderful! She was so helpful, really listened to what I wanted, and didn’t let anyone talk over me. She didn’t seem like she was trying to sell me a dress from her, but just like she was trying to help me find a dress I loved. She was completely okay with me not buying that day, and not pushy at all. She gave me lots of insight about my own style, my body type and general wedding dress information. She was even helpful about bridesmaid and flower girl dresses! She didn’t make me feel rushed, but still got me in a ton of dresses. She even got chairs for all 5 people I brought. All the other sales people were complimentary and friendly. Everyone seemed to be generally happy for you and wanting to help you. Overall it was a great experience. I left with a better idea of what I am looking for, and may even go back to try on a few more.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Had an appointment at Costa Mesa location! Didn’t find the dress and  like my stylist was not really hearing me very well. When I inquired about one more dress she encouraged me to make a follow up appointment ( I am assuming my time was up) driving home, my mom and I stoped at the Long Beach location to inquire about the one dress I wanted to ask about. Although I didn’t have an appointment , the Long Beach team still welcomed me with open arms. They helped me accessorize my dress and I ended up saying yes to it! :) I very much appreciate there guidance as dress shopping can be sooooo overwhelming . Thank you ladies! I am forever grateful 💗< /text>

<Review>10/10 for service this morning with my appointment with Teresa. She was so wonderful to us in helping me find my dream dress. She was very intuitive with the style that would fit me best and making us feel at ease during our appointment and helping us pick out hair accessories to go with the dress. I’m so excited to pick up the dress in July when it comes and get it sized! Thank you so much to Teresa for being so kind and sharing wonderful stories with me and my mom.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>Sarah was our consultant. I cant say enough about her expertise and professionalism. She knows the stock, she listens to the brides vision, she's VERY helpful. Also impressed with the stores cleanliness and selection. The other staff members were also kind. Even though my future DIL was not ready to make her decision she did not feel pressured by Sarah.  We are definitely coming back. I'm also coming back for their huge selection of formal dresses. Kudos to LB David's Bridal<//Text>< Date>

My stylist was excellent.  She gave my daughter, who is my maid of honor so many choices of dresses that she was able to find just the right one for my wedding. She also picked out really beautiful accessories for her dress which I bought along with the shoes. When I initially came in for my brides dress the receptionist was sp helpful.  I found my dress on my own off the rack along with shoes, belt, and veil.  I bought them over a week ago. I love David's bridal for the beautiful selection of dresses, accessories,  shoes and veils and their price points can't be beat. I will recommend David's bridal for my daughter when she marries and anyone I know who needs a beautiful helpful store to get all they need for their wedding. Thank you for all the professional staff you have working at the Long beach town center store in Long Beach. You also give great value for the dresses you sell. Thank you. I will bring a picture in after my wedding.</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Catherine was a kind, personable, amazing woman that helped made my dress dream come true. She payed attention to my online style quiz, knew her inventory well, took my concerns/insecurities and budget into account and brought me 3 dresses to try on. I cried in the first one. The second was pretty, and the third was a wild card. I put back on the first and sobbed. She brought a wonderful matching diamond edge veil and put it in my hair. My FMIL found a headpiece and Catherine put it in. I said yes to my dress!
Catherine took so many pictures like.. 20 for us. And never complained. Not once. She is an angel. Would definitely recommend The David's bridal at the Long Beach Towne center; be sure to ask for Catherine too!!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

My sister and I went in exactly one week before our brothers wedding to get our dresses in a hurry since our other dresses were cancelled last minute. Everyone was very sweet and helpful in our search for bridesmaids dresses. We got rush alterations and the dresses were ready on Thursday of that week. Everything went perfectly and our dresses looked beautiful! A special thank you to the wonderful ladies in alterations who moved through the process quickly<//text>

Very attentive to your needs and very friendly. I had only one suggestion when you buy a dress alterations  should be included. It doesn't make no sense how much it cost for alterations. There are alot of women that has a bottle fit body. Otherwise love the customer service.<//text>

<user_id>101689877747873602859< /user_id><review>Fabiola and Vart and the rest of the team were amazing to work with. I bought my dress from David's Bridal for my vow renewal and I went in knowing what I dress I wanted. I only have a two week window as this was planned spontaneously last minute. I saw my dress I wanted on the mannequin and hoped it would be my size. Fabiola took it off and it fit almost like a glove. I am getting a few measurements that will be done asap. The ladies were so helpful, so full of joy despite being in a pandemic. I truly felt the love, compassion and genuine care. You ladies were so amazing to work with and it touched my heart. Keep up the amazing work! Your passion for what you do is amazing and I am so thankful for all of your love and help. Lots of Love!

My fiance and I entered into David's Bridal to look at first. However, at the end of the day I purchased the dress for my fiance. A beautiful dress, but was more beautiful on. Sabrina was the coordinator helping with the dresses to try on. Sabrina was very  knowledgeable and passive throughout the fittings which made it a very comfortable for my fiance.

Thank you Sabrina!<//review>

Stylist Sabrina Mendoza was superb! She was friendly, kind, and patient. She listened to what I wanted and delivered. I said yes to the second dress I tried on. Sabrina also had a good eye for accessorizing and suggested great hair pieces (headband & veil). It was overall a very pleasant experience. I definitely recommend Sabrina, her manager, and David’s Bridal.<//text>

Omg! The customer service in this location is absolutely excellent. I went during COVID-19. I was welcomed in the store and my stylist (Symone) introduced herself and had my account open and ready. She was so helpful as well as the entire staff. The entire staff was professional and thoughtful! Would definitely recommend< /Text>

<review>I'm a little disappointed with the overall selection. My bridemaids range from different sizes and I would have expected David's Bridal to have all sizes in different styles. Most of the samples were dirty and my bridesmaids advisor really didn't seem like she knew what she was doing. I feel like working at a bridal shop you should know the ends and outs of the different styles you have to offer as well as offering insight on what type of general look you're going for.< /review>< user_id>

Rush you thru , showed rows of dresses to look at but were not allowed to touch. So how in the world can you know which one without looking at it. So rushed  I could not choose, also don’t bother doing your profile, because they didn’t use it , if they are so rush why didn’t they already have dress types ready so you can try them on and not waste time, my consultant talked so fast and acted like she had to get us out of there. Very disappointed, was warned but I choose to continue. They were too stressed there, very sad< /Review>

<review>I was impredsed with the service and cleanness that David's Bridal had with Covid 19. Fabiola the bridal specialist made me feel super special. She wasn't pushy allowed me to take time to look through all the dress made sugestions and didn't get upset after all that I didn't find a dress. She made it seem like its so common and welcomed me to come back. I so will come back because of her< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><resp>None< /resp></record>

I had a great experience at David’s bridal.
I was able to make my appointment online and and keep track of dresses I wanted to try once I got there.
Fabiola was my stylist and she was very sweet and helpful. She did not make me feel rushed or uncomfortable.
She first went based off my list, but then paid attention to my likes and dislikes and helped make selections of her own.
I ended up with a completely different style than I had originally imagined but I am so so happy with my purchase and experience.</text>

The dress was amazing but the consultant that helped me was “Fabiola” she promised me that for a certain item I would get a discount and when I purchased it the price was way off and when I confronted her about her mistake she denied it. These people shouldn’t be lying to get their sales or commission. If she did it to me how many other people can she do it to next.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I scheduled a bridesmaid fitting weeks in advance for today 11/2/19 at 10:30am. The consultant assigned to me was Theresa, an older lady who seemed very sweet. She was very disoriented as we began interacting. When I showed her the dresses I favored online, she immediately informed me which styles weren't available in store without suggesting a similar option, just plain out shut me down.

She then wrote down the style numbers & suggested I start looking for the styles & pull them myself because she had to go find the other bridesmaids she was assigned to as she had been double booked!!! My sister (the bride) bought her dress at this store & so I know that guests aren't supposed to pull their own dresses, it ruin the moment & can be a liability for the store. Theresa then proceeded to suggest that I was about 2-6 sizes larger than what I actually look like, in other words she called me fat . Before leaving me to go to her other assigned group, she mentioned that it can all go very well if we do not become too overtly demanding. While it may not have been her fault that she was assigned to two groups, her approach was unprofessional & extremely rude.

I addressed the matter with the manager (didn't get her name) who informed me that double booking is a custom at David's Bridal. She then offered to assist Theresa in working with us so that neither bridesmaid group felt neglected--that should have been done from the beginning, it's good customer service! I have been a customer for over a decade as my family and I have purchased wedding gowns, quinceañera and flower girls dresses. I will not return to David's bridal again.

Bottom line, if you do decide to risk booking an appointment with this terrible establishment, call in advance to ensure you are NOT double booked and that you are NOT assigned to Theresa.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I want to thank Savanna at David's Bridal in Long Beach for helping me find the dream dress I never thought I'd want or have. Not only did she make the process fun and memorable for my family and I, but she also made the experience effortless. With her help and the help of David's Bridal I had an evening I will never forget. The evening I found my wedding dress.</Text>

My very first bridal place to shop. Said yes to the dress. From start to finish had a great experience! Kellie she was absolutely terrific! Finished up the appointment with Allie she was also terrific! They both were extremely helpful.

<text>I want to start off by saying that I absolutely was not looking forward to this day & was dreading it. Never imagined myself as a bride & did not know what I wanted nor what looked good on me. However, my bridal consultant, Kellee, was an absolute delight! She calmed me, eased my nerves, & explained every step right down to the details. I had some photos saved as dress inspiration, but again, wasn't sure how I'd feel once I got them on. She encouraged me to pull dresses of different styles & had great recommendations when I felt lost. In total, we pulled four dresses to start off with, two of which I had adored online. She also had many veils pulled to complete the bridal look & even a sparkly headband. The entire bridal appointment took only half an hour - I ended up falling in love with dress #2 & when they say 'when you know, you know', I definitely knew! Didn't think I would get 'the feeling' but I did, tears & all. Thank you so very much Kellee & David's Bridal for making this day such a breeze for me.<//text>< Pictures>

I love that David’s Bridal have so many selections to choose from. It was very nice to be able to try on the dresses that caught my eye. The staff that assisted me was very helpful by finding more dresses to try on based on my style.< /review>

< Review>
The staff are very nice and knowledgeable, but if you need alternations, consider finding someone who is not so pricey.  The cost was almost as much as the dress for alterations of a bride's maid dress.   However, the dress was fitted to the correct size and length.< /Review>

<review>Ally was the best! I had no idea what I wanted and the way she narrowed it down for me was magical. She found THE dress that gave me that tingly feeling and it wasn't what I expected myself to go for. How she knew my direction when I had no clue is beyond me, but she did. I love my dress and have her to thank for finding it. She was so patient and thoughtful.< /review>< name>

I had such a wonderful experience with my stylist Sabrina at the king beach site!! She was so helpful and provided good tips for veils and belts! Sabrina took the time to explore the styles I liked and brought out everything I liked to try on and see what looked and felt good!! She helped me find the perfect dress! I said yes to the dress!! They have a big range of styles of dresses and sizes so you can really explore a huge variety of dresses. No pressure to buy so it made the experience that much more enjoyable! I felt so comfortable and well taken care of I made another appointment for my bridesmaids!!</review>

<Text>My whole experience with David's Bridal was a disaster.  When I arrived for my appointment they had no outfits in my size to try on.  This meant I had to try on another size and hope that my calculations on sizes would be good and what they ordered for me would fit.
I had them do the hemming that was needed, but when I picked up the outfit one pants leg was a good 2 inches shorter than the other.  On what planet would this work?  I had to sit there while they "fixed" their error.  The only upside was that they did not charge me extra for the additional hemming that needed to be done.
I can honestly say I will never buy another outfit from them.  I'd rather go to Nordstrom's and pay more.  At least their alterations department knows what to do.< /Text><Response>{'time': 1572618573700, 'text': 'Hello Stephanie, we are very sorry to hear that your experience with David’s Bridal was less than satisfactory.

<text>Amazing experience, everyone was exceptionally helpful!
I bought my dress late February, I was scared it wouldn’t be ready in time but it actually came two months earlier than expected!
Then, for my alterations I was told it would be up to 6-8 weeks of waiting but again I was surprised and it was ready within two weeks almost! Every single of the staff members were very kind and made me feel beautiful in my gown & I want to give lots of props to the lady who did my alterations! She did everything I wanted & more.<//text>< response>

<text>Rosa at the Long Beach location in alterations is by far the best tailor I’ve come across. She is very professional and gives her honest opinion. My dress is half way done, but almost looks perfect. I’m very excited to see the conclusion to my dress. She should be recognized for the amazing work that she does.

Went in on July 13th to simply window shop with my mom and bridesmaids. My stylist Karen was amazing, I wasn't even sure of what I wanted but with the little info I was able come up with she found the perfect dress for me. It was so perfect that I ended up purchasing the dress.She truly made the whole experience easy and stress free. I'm hoping I can reserve her as a stylist when my dress arrives and for my bridesmaids dresses.< /text>

Theresa G was my consultant and she was amazing! Even though I didn’t find “the dress” she went above and beyond. I left there feeling like we were kindred spirits! God bless you Theresa and you never know I might be back. Learn from those who come into your life even for a brief moment. You find that we are all connected in some little way!

I had such a great experience. I was only in the store to browse and window shop for an idea of what I would want my bridal dress should be like. As soon as I got in the store,  I was welcomed immediately. It so happened that they had an availability for dress fitting. They gave me a 90 minute window. And within those 90 minutes, I was able to find the dress of my dreams! I am so excited and the staff was so nice and gave me their honest opinions.</review>

Bought one of my wedding dresses from here! I love it here!!! They were very nice and helpful! The seamstress made the dress fit like a glove on my body! It was a beautiful dress. I didn't wear the dress for my wedding but I donated it and they were very pleased how beautiful the dress was!<//Text>

Had a great experience at this location! Rebecca helped me out and I am very happy with her service. She helped me make my final decision on the dress I picked and gave me feedback on the dresses I was trying on. So it made the process very smooth. Also, this location has lots of styles to look through. I didn’t even get to see them all. So happy with my experience. Thank you!<//Review>

I went in to pick up my wedding dress that got ordered from my first visit. I again tried it on I was reassured that with going with the smaller size they will be able to take out a little to make it more comfortable. I Love my dress I got and trust in David’s bridal consultants on this. I would definitely recommend them if you are looking for your wedding dress. They made me feel special!!
Went for my first fitting and because of getting smaller size and me gaining weight we are putting a corset back, they also are hemming and putting a bustle on it. Had to pay another $200 but with it since I love my dress!!
8/2 went for final fitting my dress turned out beautifully. The alterations lady showed my maid of honor how to tie up corset and how to do bustle too that way the wedding day it will be done right. Everyone at the Long Beach David’s is very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!< /Text>

<userid>100174864005002731091</userid><text>Rosa was wonderful.  The only issue I had was when I asked to have sleeves with lace to be added to my dress.  I was told I would have to bring the lace and they can add the lace to the sleeves.  I was not told this when I purchased the wedding dress, If I had know this, I don't think I would have purchased the dress.  I called the shop where I purchased the dress and talked to the alteration person and she called the other store where my dress is now being fix and explained to Rose how to order the lace from my sleeves and Rosa will order the lace and add them to the sleeves.  So all worked out wonderful and I Thanked everyone.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x80dd2ddd401026cf:0x54f55755000eab59<//gmapID><Name>Donna Calkins<//Name>< Date>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>The best part of this experience was the seamstress who did my alterations. She really personalized my dress and the entire experience for me.  Rosa deserves five stars.  I docked them a star because I really had to probe them to find out that they offer complimentary shipping, even when my attendants knew I was stumped about how to get my dress to my destination wedding.  They also sold me a super dirty dress, which I noticed in natural lighting at home, without offering to fully clean it. They did, however, upon my complaint, clean it properly at no additional charge. So, in summary, I would say that they ultimately provided very good service, but only when they were pressed to do so.  Which, as a bride, felt kinda poopy at times. Again, overall very happy with the final outcomes, just a bit dissatisfied with some of the steps along they way.  They are very capable of providing a very good service.  Just make sure you get it!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I am writing this review for Deveny. I was on a time crunch for a maid of honor dress and I had a difficult color that would need to be ordered and be here in time. I knew this walking in and I made three separate appointments at three different places for today. David's Bridal was my first stop and I knew walking in it was going to be a long shot. Deveny was the first to approach me and offer her assistance. When I first mentioned when I needed and what time I needed it by, she looked concerned. But she quickly changed her mind set and found dresses that would be here on time for me. She made the experience PAINLESS and I honestly hate trying on dresses. I am curvy and it is usually difficult to find something that fits. She made it so easy and I did not have very many choices. I walked out in thirty minutes with a dress ordered. And it wasn't just a dress that I settled with, it is comfy, flattering and bride approved! Thank you Deveny for taking a difficult situation and making it so easy for me. I am so grateful that you are the one who assisted me.< /Text>

<Review>The lady who helped us was very unhelpful & acted like we was bothering her. Kept bringing us the wrong dresses & sizes. I seen others being helped more than we was. (We are African American ) and they were not. I really wish my daughter would take her business somewhere else for her wedding. Somewhere that respect you & the money your spending.</Review>< Rate>

I just left David's bridal feeling amazing. Today was my first day shopping for my wedding dress and I was super nervous because I had no idea what style I would like on my body. All I knew was I love lace! I got to meet with Allie the store manager and she helped make me feel so comfortable. I went in with a bundle of nerves and left finding my dream dress! Allie really listened to what I explained to her and all the dresses she brought me fit my style. She even found a nice ballgown dress for me to try on that my mom wanted to see (even though I do not like ballgowns lol). She helped me find accessories for my dress that I didn't even know I wanted or needed. It was the best feeling and she made me feel beautiful in every dress I tried on. It was amazing and I can't wait to go back for my bridesmaids. Thank you again Allie!< /Review>

My experience with Davids Bridal has been a pleasant surprise!  The sales staff at the store on Carson in California are not only peppy and friendly,  but they REALLY do bend over backwards to make you feel comfortable while in the store. The Alterations Department----Rosa---thank you!  I recommend  this particular David's Bridal to everyone!</review>

OMG! I ordered a dress from a David's Bridal in Cincinnati and had it mailed to me all the way out here for a wedding and the "eye" was missing from the back of the dress! I came here hoping they could help me and even though it was in NO WAY their problem or mistake to fix they sewed a new one on for me!! Thank you all so much for your dedication to service, I hope this review brings more people in! And I will definitely come back! :-)))))

--Thanks especially to Jasmine, who is the most awesome--< /review>

Great choices on dresses for formals however staff is not wiping to help much. The day that helped us was totally rushing and just was not around us to ask questions. She handed us the dresses to try and each time we had to go looking around for her for any help or suggestions.   Quick to ring you up tho and finish you off to leave... but not helpful otherwise.<//Review>

We had a really great experience with Fabiola! She was very attentive and allowed all 4 of my bridesmaids to try on as many styles as we needed to find the right combination of perfection! She was the best.. thank you so much!<//Review>

When I went to get my dress everyone was nice. When I needed alterations a second time (because it wasn’t done right the first time) the lady helped me try on the dress and told me (2 times) I gained weight and that’s why the dress didn’t fit and walked out the room. Not something a bride wants to hear.
The manager who is AMAZING cane in, put me in the dress and made sure everything was fine. Great store but not for alterations 😕</Text>

< Review>
This place is amazing. I came in at the last minute (2 days prior to my wedding day). And I had the best bridal consultant ever. She made sure that my expectations were met. She took the time to make sure that I found a dress that I would love and that I had plenty of options to choose from. She helped me try on and take off the dresses so that my family could just enjoy the show. And just how she asked my style of dress and took it from there which took alot of pressure off my shoulders..</Review>

<review>The workers at the store were very nice and helpful. There was a good selection of bridesmaids dresses to try on.

My frustration was with the ordering. There were a few dress/color/size options that could not be ordered. For example, we decided with the consultant that we would order a dress in “dusty sage.” After we all picked our dresses, she said no dresses were available in that color. Then maybe the sample dresses shouldn’t be in that color, if we can’t even get it? I also wanted a certain size but it wouldn’t arrive until after the wedding, so I had to order a size bigger. For a store that pretty much only sells dresses, it seemed difficult for us to get a dress once we knew what we wanted!<//review>< user_name>

<Text>I gave 5 stars because Fabiola was amazing in listening to me.  I told her what I was looking for and she nailed it.  She even brought something that I would have never considered.  She gave reasons why she picked it.  I wish DB has more selection in my size.  Fabiola is the reason I gave it a 5 star.  Thank you Fabiola!</Text>< pics>

<Text>Today, we went to the David’s Bridal on 7621 E Carson St at Long Beach Town Center. I made this appointment at a bridal expo I attended last month in Anaheim. Other than that, I had no work on Feb 11. Anyway, I was just planning to “look” at dresses that might be a potential pick for my November 23 wedding. To be more detailed on this review, I was looking for a “Flowy” dress with 3/4 sleeves and a good enough covering for my neck. My consultant was Jacquelyn and she knew what I was looking for with my description, because I knew NOTHING about wedding dresses (I have never been married before 😂). The first dress, I loved; however, I loved the second too! What a dilemma, but Jacquelyn knew exactly what I was looking for and she found it with also my budget!!! Unfortunately, it wasn’t at the store; therefore, I needed to come back the first week of March. Fast forward, as we walk to the register to pay for a deposit, the supervisor, Allie, & Jacquelyn are my angels! They told me they will pay for my dress! When they told my mom and I that, we started crying! I am so thankful for these two individuals! They deserve everything positive in their lives because I would admit not a lot of people in this world are like them! I will truly be grateful for them for the rest of my life! Other than that, that will definitely help me with my plans for my upcoming wedding!< /Text>< username>

I went on a Sunday and because I could tell she was sweet as pie and wonderfully skilled, I asked to pick up my dress on Sunday to make sure it was given to me by her. She worked hard on my dress and she made everything a reality for me. When I picked up my dress she carefully explained what was done to me and my mother and she showed us how to lift the bustle. Maria was very kind to me and my mother but what impacted me the most is that she left the dress beautifully altered to my fit.

<Text>I had a great experience at this David's Bridal.  I set up an appointment and Britain, my assigned stylist, was very attentive to the style of dress I was looking for.  He answered all of my questions, and he was exceptionally knowledgeable about petite fits & alterations.  My only complaint is that this location lacked a few of the newer dresses that I was really looking forward to trying on;  I live in a rural area and this was my only day to try on dresses.  Despite this, Britain helped me find two gorgeous dresses that I am currently deciding between; I think I'm close to making a decision  :)<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The sales associate Uche was very helpful and pleasant she gave me great advice on how to enhance my weeding dress by adding belts and lace covering for my arms and top.

I cannot even begin to express how grateful I am for this store. I came into this store two weeks before my wedding due to an issue with my dress at another boutique (they never finished it), and I am blown away by their customer service and way to come through. Everyone was extremely helpful and patient. I found an amazing dress and they were able to make all the adjustments necessary to give me the perfect fit for my body. Thank you everyone at David's Bridal Long Beach for all you did for me. Shout out to Rosa for all the extra details on my dress to make it look amazing.< /text>

<Review>Would have been 5 starts but the first woman who helped me, Teresa, said she’d add my dresses to my profile which she didn’t. Then, when I called to make a 2nd appointment whoever answered did apologize and said she’d reach out to Teresa to add the dresses to my profile and that still didn’t happen. However, when I did go for my second appointment, Doris was super helpful and helped me find my dream dress.< /Review>< Rating>

I'm so sorry, but after going there, I was super discouraged!  The undergarment provided by them, was not at all the right size and/or just not needed.
There was a time limit, making me nervous.
I tried on 5 dresses, none were fitting well at all.  And didn't look like the picture I brought in of a dress I liked.
But after going to another place, I realize it was the quality of the dresses.
The sales gal was nice though, just wasn't feeling any of the dresses there</Text>

I had an amazing experience. I got to David’s bridal early even though my appt time was 2pm. One of the ladies in charge of the dress alteration department in David’s bridal told me to fill out paperwork while I wait for an available room. They were so nice and were apologizing for the long wait. I stated to them it’s not a problem it’s my day off today i am in no rush. Chi was one of the ladies that was doing the alteration on my dress was fantastic.< /Text>

My experience from start to finish at David's Bridal was so professional and the best experience. Often times as a bride you have no idea what you want, what you are looking for and they were so helpful and made my entire experience personable. My bridal party, my mom and I were all able to find exactly what we liked and fell in love with. Alyssa and Jacqueline was the best!!! They were honest, and helpful with all that we asked for!!! Thanks again for taking so much stress off me and giving me the most best experience!!!

<Text>I had a late 7:30pm appointment, but it wasn't just me, my soon to be wife added onto my appointment so that we would both be able to try on wedding dresses together to see how they would look. Fabiola and Selina helped us get into and out of our dresses quickly and efficiently and even though we booked a late night appointment close to closing time we never once felt rushed. They were professional and had a great eye for what silhouette,  material, and color would look good on us. They took our budget into consideration and found us the best dresses for our price range. They made this feel so easy and painless, i will be recommending all my friends!</Text><time>1533311386959<//time><user>106467818903921120722</user><rating>5< /rating>< name>

I did NOT enjoy my experience at this DB. From the minute my bridesmaids and I got introduce to our sales representative to the very last minute we did not have a pleasant experience. My bridesmaid pulled some initial dresses they wanted to try on, and the representative from then on brought dresses that were not of our liking nor of our request. She did not consult with my girls and ask them how they were feeling or what was comforting to them. To top it off she never offered me a seat I stood for the whole 2 hours of our appointment. She was terrible! I could tell my bridesmaid were not having it and I wasn’t having it. Towards the end of our appointment  the representative pulled me aside  and mentioned if I knew what I wanted, and that I needed to put my foot down. That was not okay!  Of course I know what I want. I walked out of the DB In Long Beach very unsatisfied.< /text>

Size selection was lacking due to high wedding season. Majority sizes were 12 and up. I was hoping to have someone pull suggestions but the woman that was assigned to my party just walked by a few times to ask how the dress fit and walked away. I had to ask for clips and ended up clipping it myself. What was the point of scheduling an appointment if I had to just do everything myself? Anyway, bridesmaids had a big selection and lots of color choices so that’s a plus. I’d still recommend the place but just depends who your appointment is with. I was talking to one of the girls nearby and she was working with Uche and adored her so I’d say ask for her if you go.<//text>

I had scheduled an appointment online so I was helped very quickly, but the only downside was that they were so busy that I didn't really get any personal attention that I saw some other girls were getting from other stylists. It would have been nice, but that's alright. Doris was actually so great and helpful with finding dresses that I had previously picked out and letting me know what my options were in terms of placing items on hold and looking for dresses in my particular size in other stores.< /review>

<Text>Had a very good experience with David's Bridal today, definitely worthy of a post!  I am going to be the Maid of Honor is my friends wedding just one week and a day from now.  We bought the dresses from this store on sale a few months ago.  Last week I thought I'd better get some shoes to match it so I put the dress on to determine how high of a heel I should get and I couldn't even zip the dress up.  Clearly it had shrunk in the last three months! :)   So I take it to a tailor and she tells me that unlike most gowns like this one, this one didn't have enough material to work with so she could not alter it.  Yikes!  So I went to get a second opinion somewhere else and they told me the same thing.  So I made an appointment with the alterations lady at David's Bridal in Long Beach where we bought the dress.  She said that she couldn't fix it either so they found the same dress two sizes up from the one I had.  I bought a size 8 which fit perfectly everywhere except it wouldn't zip up, too tight in the back.  They found me a 12.  Tried it on and it zipped up easily but was over all too big and too long.  The manager was calling other stores to see if they had a size 10 but no luck.  She went through every rack in the store searching for a size 10 in apple red and there it was on the last rack and out of place but she found it.  I tried it on and it fit perfectly!  They were happy to exchange it for me even though they didn't have to since we bought the dress on sale.  The cost of the alterations, being this close to the wedding would have cost  more than we paid for the dress! ($150)  So it was a good day.  Thanks David's Bridal!!<//Text>< resp>

Went in today to find a dress for my small wedding ceremony this weekend!  I’m about 33wks pregnant and wasn’t looking to spend very much, I already had a dress to wear but wasn’t sure about it. So I thought I’d come here and see if there was anything I really liked. Being that I went alone I was kind of skeptical. Everyone was very warm and friendly. My stylist Teresa was so sweet and funny she made feel so comfortable. She kept in my price range and still managed to find me many dress possibilities. I left very happy and with a beautiful dress that was exactly what I was looking for. Thank you Teresa and David’s Bridal!< /Review>

I went into David's Bridal today for alterations for my bridal gown , which I just bought on Thursday for a wedding that is just one week away.  This was due to a dress that I bought online, which was a disaster.  Mari in alterations is AWESOME!!!!   She not only did the necessary alterations that I needed, but created sleeves from an ivory satin Shaw to match my vintage style dress.  She made my dress look absolutely beautiful and it will be ready for me to pick up in  four days, just in time for my wedding.  Thank you so much Mari!!!!  😃</review>

I went in looking for a bridesmaid dress. I love this location better than the poor service at Torrance. Ana helped me. She was sweet and of course it was Sunday so I can understand to not expect her undivided attention she was able to balance myself and a customer. She made me feel good about my decision considering I was in with my twins. I will say Davids Bridal needs to remodel all locations. The place looks like a poor store from the 80's and most of there locations look old and dry.< /Text>

Hey Ladies reading this,
I made an appointment with the staff. I had been in there a few days earlier alone and couldn’t find anything I liked, however at the appointment things quickly changed. I was met with the best salesperson and so patient. She ask what ?.. and when ?...I gave her my answers and she started pulling away. That weekend I came back with my girlfriends it was amazing. I saw another dress more amazing than the other two before. I would highly recommend this place I was pleasantly surprised and extremely
happy about the process. Thank you David’s Bridal !!!!<//Review>

Not happy!
When we finally decided on 'the dress' for my granddaughters first holy communion, we asked our friendly and helpful saleslady to find out when we could get the dress delivered by. She went and checked, came back and told us April 21st.
Then once we paid for the dress, the cashier told us the delivery date was for May 2nd. That's 11 days later!!!!
Then the cashier quickly responded that all sales are final!
I AM NOT HAPPY.</review>

I had such a great experience at David’s Bridal recently.  Fabie was so amazing!  Not only did she help me find the dress of my dreams but she was so patient and helped me feel super comfortable in the dressing room.  All the staff was so wonderful and made me feel so welcome and important.  I felt like they had such a great selection of dresses and was able to try on every silhouette and style I wanted.  Thanks to all the girls working I am a happy bride to be!!!!  Would 10/10 recommend to all my friends and family.  Thanks again Fabie!!<//review>

I called 800 number that’s a joke. Over $200 for a brides made with bad Experience. If I would or ordered it online I would of got it within two weeks 7-12 business days. I will take it to BBB over priced dresses and they can’t even tell you what’s going on with your order.< /text><resp>{'time': 1536177114154, 'text': 'Hello Gloria, thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

<user_id>100718509336227085807</user_id><Review>I had my Wedding Items stolen out of the car and I still had to keep my appointment for my Wedding dress alterations and the David's bridal crew were amazing and went above and beyond .Ally the manager that night made choices for me that were spot on I started Crying  the sweetest young lady who confirms your appointments I had informed here of what happened prior to getting to alterations and she said do you mind if I give you a hug? And gave me a hug and I just started balling I made it through  the evening and went to pay for my things and I asked the young lady. What is your name and she replied "Faith" of course I got very emotional again and Ally said if you can't find this last item just give me a call and we will figure it out or go with what the item on hand  closest to what they took. I can't express how much they helped me get through the loss of my wedding purchaes and tured my sad disappointing day into a Positive one. Thank you Ally, Faith and Chee. La Saundra B

This rating is not a reflection on this particular location. All sales people here were extremely helpful! This is more about company policy and the fine print... when you shop online.. free shipping is a given and free returns are also a given these days! Davids bridal does not create an easy exchange experience, worse you have to pay for shipping it back!! You should be able to exchange in store... let's get hip to e-commerce Davids Bridal, Amazon and most every other retailer knows that customer convenience is King!</Review>

<Review>The service at David’s Bridal was mediocre. While the managers were extremely helpful, the line staff were inexperienced and not very friendly.  The stylist assigned to assist me refused to show me dresses that were on sale or in my budget. The salon was extremely crowded and, although I had an appointment with my entire bridal party, there were not enough dressing rooms to try on dresses and our stylist was rushed and left us before we were done to begin on her next group.  I would not recommend David's Bridal to anyone and ultimately purchased my wedding gown at another wedding boutique.</Review><Rate>2</Rate><time>1522108787496< /time><userid>106115610222220786975</userid><Gmap_id>0x80dd2ddd401026cf:0x54f55755000eab59<//Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Paula Swift<//username><Resp>{'time': 1522344114640, 'text': "Hello Paula.

My 1st consultant was Kimberly and she was sooooo great. She had patience and was so helpful
(she picked out the gown I purchased). Only reason I gave a 4 start & not 5 was because I had a second consultant and she was nothing like KImberly. We did let the manager know and she was very helpful. Other than that I loved the experience here :)</Review>

Friendly and helpful sales staff and great prices! I went two different times, once for my wedding dress and once for bridesmaid dresses. In December 2015 Danielle helped me. Danielle were great! She helped me find my dress after just three tries. I bought it off the rack for 99! It used to be 399. Two weeks ago Theresa helped me find the perfect bridesmaid dress. Both gave no pressure and were just really helpful in bringing options based on what I told them I wanted. The manager was nice also. She came by to see how I was doing when Danielle was helping me.< /Review>

Went in yesterday to buy my wedding dress. They had it on hold for me and I was attended quickly,only thing was that my,consultant just put me in the room with the dress and never came back to help me tie the dress or anything. It was kinda busy tho but I would have a appreciated a bit more attention at least with tying the dress. Other than that experience was great and would definitely would recommend to friends and family.<//text>

<review>Kellee was an absolute dream to work with. She was extremely patient and knowledgeable. She knew what would work with my body type. She made the experience low stress and fun. I kept going back and forth between two dresses and she patiently let me keep trying them on. I can’t say enough about what a pleasant experience I had at that particular Davids with Kellee. i never felt pressured or that she was after a sale. She was very considerate of budget.
Note: not all Davids are created equal. Had a horrible experience at the Metro Pointe Davids the day before. Go to this location!</review>< Pics>

<Review>i had a great experience with Martina. She helped me try all the different styles so i could get an idea of the style of wedding dress i would like for my wedding. we tried about 5 different styles and was able to narrow down the style that i liked. the last dress she had me try on was magical. she really listened to what i liked and disliked about the different dresses. and found one that was right in the middle of everything i wanted. she also brought out some accessories to try since i wanted to include black into my dress. i unfortunately did not get the dress from David's Bridal but i really apprecipate the help and attention Martina was able to give me. and i would recommend her to help with future brides and bridesmaids. thank you Martina! your the best!<//Review>< Pics>

After looking all over and going to different David's bridal stores and other bridal shops I finally found the dress at this location! I was so happy and lucky too because the dress I got was part of the $99 sale originally priced at close to $600! Anyways it needed to be cleaned, steamed and there was a couple holes that needed to be fixed so I left it in alterations the guy who took my order reassured me that my dress would look like new once I pick it up for my final fitting!
So today I go to pick up my dress look at it and it's still dirty especially around the armpit area the lady in alterations tells me that the guy didn't have time to clean it that it would be ready Tuesday I told her I don't have time to wait til then and everything was supposed to be fixed! Anyways when I tried it on the other Latina lady from alterations helped me and after she took the dress back and she worked on the dress to clean it!
Well after I take the dress to my maid of honor house and she was inspecting the dress and there are 2 big holes that were there before and they were supposed to fix which they didn't!
Luckily my mother in law is going to fix the dress for me!
To everybody that gets alterations there please double check the work they do on it and just because you are buying a clearance dress doesn't mean they can't fix it right!<//review>

Absolutely lovely experience! I have been looking everywhere for my bridesmaid dresses and finally decided to bring my bridesmaids to David's Bridal. Our stylist, Jin, went above and beyond! She was so helpful and was very patient and proactive with all our questions and requests! Will be going back to have the moms of the wedding get their dresses.< /Review>

Absolutely felt welcomed, they made me feel comfortable, it's very exciting and personal, I didn't really know exactly what I wanted in a wedding dress and she definitely told one dress listen to what I liked and didn't like pulled another dress I kept going until we found the exact dress and everything I ever told her in detail  from the other dresses. She also made my friends feel comfortable and welcomed and it was just a very exciting blessed happy event in my wedding. I said yes to the dress!</text>

I walked in and no nmone greeted me. I was not asked if i needed help until i went up to one of the ladies. The two girls at the counter were too busy talking to eachother. Luckily an hr later my bride to be came in and asked them for help. The two ladies that helped us were very sweet and attentive.
David's Bridal you really need to get your entire team to have better customer service skills. Having two people at the check in counter who DO NOT GREET NEW CUSTOMERS is a complete disregard for our dollars.
Luckily two other ladies were the complete opposite.

Also, you should spray more febreze and wash your dresses. I tried a lot of them that smelled really bad and had deodorant stains .</text>

<Review>I waited 15-20 minutes for someone to help me . Then after I waited finally got someone after I said something . She was taking forever she didn’t know what I was talking about I was asking her opinions her help . She just looked at me said ok walked away never came back with anything when I asked if she can bring me something cute in her eyes usually they got good taste what is most out there . Instead she looked at me weird . This was first David’s bridal I’ve been to who gives poor service . Others I left satisfied happy. This one is a never again
Her name was kobby I believe it was but I honestly don’t recommend in my eyes . She played like she knew but she didn’t she could of been honest and help me instead of me going for her asking her what’s going on .< /Review>< Pictures>

I was very lucky that Rosa, the alterations manager, was assigned to me because she was the most professional person at the time of doing the alterations and completing it on time.  Her personality, skill knowledge and charisma made it fun an gave me the peace of mind that I needed that my gown was going to be finished on time for my wedding.  Karen, the shop manager, was a sweetheart too, always trying to help and giving me advise on the different gowns I tried, and even gave me the idea to hire a drone pilot to capture my entrance at the Rio Hondo Golf Club where we got married.  Thank you for everything Rosa and Karen!!!<//Review></record>

<review>My experience was not great I purchased the dress they told me to come back in 3 weeks for alterations. They failed to mention that alterations were not included. Not to mention the alterations cost more than my dress. They told me I could order my shoes today, then supposedly I can't order them until July 3rd. I am not a happy camper 😡< /review>< pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>My daughter dealt with a salesperson by the name of Teresa. She was horrible!!! She took my daughter in for fitting and in the fitting room she let her know that the dress she was trying on would not fit her and she didn't think that they would have a dress in her size, mind you my daughter is only a 120 lbs 17 Yes old. This was extremely rude and unprofessional for someone in a business of fitting young women. There is ways to go about notifying somebody of their fitting without embarrassing,degrading and humiliating them in front of the Bridal party. I am definitely going to reach out to Headquarters so they can make sure that they send their salespeople to training courses on how to go about speaking to women who are getting fitted and trying to find the right dress for a special occasion. They just lost future generations of business!!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

My daughter and 5 family members came to David's Bridal for my daughter's first attempt to try on wedding dresses to see which style she would prefer for her upcoming wedding. Our experience was not very good.  I would give 1 star but her stylist Natalie was very patient and very sweet. First we had an appointment and still had to wait almost 20 minutes before being helped.The shop itself did not have many updated dresses to choose from (very outdated). It was not very clean, the floors had very big dirty stain. There were no accommodations for the bride to be (water, proper seating etc.) Like I said the only reason why I gave 3 stars was because Natalie was really sweet and helped my daughter. Other than that we will not be returning to this shop.<//Review>

Customer service is good but the only reason I gave 4 stars was that I purchased a prom dress for my daughter which was 300.00.   The dress was a little long so needed a hem which cost me an additional 75.00 you would think when you buy a dress that cost 300.00 that free hemming would of been included.</review>

<Text>I had such an amazing experience with davids bridal in the Carson shopping center in Long Beach. I was greeted right away and seen very quickly by Jimmy. He was sick a sweet and amazing person to help find my perfect dress. He had me try on about 13 dresses and I fell in love with the fifth dress I put on. I automatically started to cry. Jimmy was very excited and happy that he could be the one that helped me find my one. I couldn't be happier with my experience and I wish I could give them more then just 5 stars. I also hope they recognize jimmy for all of his hard work and being a truly amazing person and worker:)</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Not what I expected.  Was hoping to purchase a dress for my daughter's first communion directly off the rack only to find out I'd have to order it and it would take 4-10 weeks.  Then I found out from another mother, who was also shopping for a first communion dress for her daughter, that she could buy the dress directly off the rack.  I know I made my appointment on a Saturday and they were really busy, but I feel like the sales woman was only telling me that so I would get out of her hair and she could help other customers.< /review>

< Review>
I went into David’s Bridal yesterday to look for a dress for an upcoming event and the ladies up front were all very welcoming and helpful. However, while trying on my options I overheard a female employee yelling at someone in the back of the store. I’m not sure if they realize that people can hear them from the fitting rooms. Moments later I saw another employee leave the alterations area nearly in tears. From what I heard, I would have been upset too if I were them. Now I’m not sure if I’ll be having my dress altered here because I can’t imagine them doing their best work in such a hostile environment.<//Review>

I went to look for wedding dresses yesterday and they were VERY busy. But it was a Saturday, what do you expect.

I had to wait an extra 30-45 mins after my appointment time until a stylist was free. The manager came out and explained what was happening, everyone was kind and apologize for the wait. So it was all good.

My stylist was Jimmy. I wasn't expecting to find anything I liked but he worked it! He picked out great dresses, gave great tips, and was overall very helpful. Although he was working with 2 clients I didn't feel like I was competing for his time and didn't feel pressured to buy anything today which was very important to me since it was my first time looking at dresses.

I'd definitely go back.<//text>

<Text>I checked in to my appointment at 7:30 pm and was not greeted right away. This shop also seemed a little dirty and run down, i.e. stains on the carpet and scratches dressing room doors. The shop seemed busy for a Wednesday evening. I understand the bride will always come before the bridal party. By the time I was able to speak to someone about looking at the dresses and getting a fitting room, it was about 5 mins into my appointment. The woman that helped me was very friendly and greeted me with a smile. She told me to get the dresses I wanted to try on and then someone would open a dressing room. Once I was ready I was hanging around the dressing rooms waiting for someone to help me, this is about 15 mins in to my appointment time and still no stylist has checked in with me. A different woman helped me in to a dressing room. I tried on about 3 of the 5 dresses I chose until someone had asked me if a stylist had checked in, another 10 mins have passed. I replied with "No one has formally introduced themselves to me yet..." The person on the other side of my dressing room door stated she would get someone for me. I tried on the other 2 dresses and no one checked in, another 10 mins. Which, I realize, was fine as there were only other brides in the shop that evening and I am just a maid of honor. After I was done trying on the first 5 dresses I picked out, I believe, it was Heather? (woman with short hair and glasses, very kind) who finally checked in to see if I needed different sizes or other dresses. I informed her what length and color I needed for the wedding, short and Juniper. She told me this particular store did not carry many short dresses. She helped me find long dresses with the similar style of top and said they could order it a shorter length. This stylist was handling myself and a bride, so needless to say she was busy. While the stylist tried her best to keep up with giving advise and helping 2 people at the same time, the bride did take priority over my appointment. I was unable to find a dress on this visit but the stylist was very kind and helped me figure out the latest date/time of year I would need to pick and order a dress. Overall the appointment was somewhat lacking for someone who wanted some guidance and for someone who wasn't a bride. I would have liked to have someone around to help me in and out of dresses, even if they just helped me zip in. As far as customer service, the ladies I interacted with were kind but I did not get a lot of face time with any of them. It did not seem like the shop was short staffed as there were about 3 people behind the front counter at any given time and I only saw, maybe 2 people helping anyone that was in the fitting area. I wish I had a better time at this shop but I am unable to give a stellar review. I am only giving 3 stars for lovely ladies I made contact with, otherwise this review would deserve a 2 or 1 star review.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Came here not knowing what I liked or what to do but Theresa was there too help! I went by myself and she treating like I was one of her friends :) I told her my budget and she worked with that. I tried about 6 different dresses before I found the one! I rang the bell and made my wish it was so cute! I’m not a girly girl so I was really scared to come into the store but after that experience I would recommend everyone I know to his location thanks to Theresa! I will be back to get alterations done! :D</Review>

< review>
On Friday 2/8/19 I walked into the store with my sisters and was immediately greeted by Fabiola. She told my sisters and I to give her a quick minute so that she can get some papers for me to fill out for my event. After filling out the paperwork Fabiola sprung into action and asked what I was looking for in a dress. She allowed me to show her pictures of what I wanted or envisioned, and off she went to go through those racks in search of dresses for me to try on. She was truly amazing. She was able to capture my vision down to the T. I was able to walk out of there feeling extremely happy with my decision, less stressed, and less overwhelmed. Thank you Fabiola ! You are truly amazing at your job! We need more people out there like you, who enjoy what they do and take great pride in it.< /review>

First, assistant was helping me and another person at the same time during my appointment. Not very personal.
Second, waited 6 months for my dress and then it was shipped to the store instead of to me in Florida.
Third, when my wedding dress finally arrived, it was in a plastic bag and a dirty, crushed box with nothing protecting it!  It was a miracle my dress was not damaged or ruined!  Totally ruined by wedding dress buying experience. :<<//text>

< Review>
I came in with my fiancé's god mom cause I had a tight budget and I wanted to make sure I stayed in that range. I just came to try on styles and walked out with a dress!!!! I love the one I got and it was well under my budget!!! The only suggestion is to go on a week day!!!! The lady who was helping me was helping another bride and I ended up doing most of the trying on by myself. Sometimes I really needed help and most of the time wasn't there to help me. I did feel neglected a lot of the time<//Review>

I was very fortunate to have Uche as my stylist and Chi do my alterations. I came in on a Friday night to check out some dresses.  My appointment was for the next day. The person at the front was confusing as she made comments about availability before actually checking so we just looked around and booked a same day appointment for an hour later that night.  We found some dresses we liked,  then Uche came to greet us with her big smile and upbeat personality.  I can't tell you how much that improved our experience. She was patient and helped me find my dress! I also asked about alterations and she brought out Chi who was very nice and booked an appointment. Uche took us up to the register to ring us up and complete the transaction which we were interrupted by someone who wanted to take over so Uche can help her next customer,  however my issue with this is that i just spent the last hour with Uche who knows every detail of everything i need and all my dates. I felt very uneasy when they were going to have someone else step in when Uche was almost done.  Very uneasy for a bride to be.  So we asked if she can finish the transaction and then someone else stepped in to reschedule the alterations due to some changes. She kept saying the wrong dates and reading the wrong things that made me glad that she wasn't the one who finalize my dress order. Anyways,  my dress came in sooner than expected for a rush order which was great,  i came in for alterations with Chi, she measured and pinned both of my dresses and had me walk in it to make sure i was comfortable,  same thing when i came to pick it up. She was very busy,  i think she had 3 other appointments at the same time so i had to wait in between but when she was able to get to me,  she made sure i was comfortable and fitted to my dress. I didn't know what to expect from davids bridal but i was glad i stopped in.  I would definitely come back to purchase dresses for special occasions.< /text>

<Text>Fabiola is the best! Everyone is friendly and professional but she goes out of her way to make sure you have the best possible  experience. While it’s true that they book 2 clients at a time and you may have to wait, I didn’t mind too much as I was talking with family and friends between dress fittings. Fabiola followed up with our appointment, kept her eye open for a dress we were looking for, again followed up when it came in and assisted us when we didn’t have an appointment.  I have been there several times for bridesmaids, bridal dress shopping and flower girl shopping and they have consistently been professional, knowledgeable and patient.<//Text><date>1510807151139</date><rating>5<//rating></record>

I bought my wedding dress at Alfred Angelo in Brea. For those that don't already know, Alfred Angelo went bankrupt and shut the doors to all their stores. Thankfully I had my wedding dress at home, however I still needed to get my dress altered, and my veil stayed behind at the store. I immediately called David's bridal and desperately asked for help with my alterations since I no longer had a store. The woman talked to the manager in the alterations department (who I later met, Rosa) and said they would help. From the moment I walked in, they were all so helpful and understanding of my frustration. I worked with Rosa every time I would go in. She would give me her undivided attention every time. I never felt rushed, and even when I sprained my ankle, she told me to wait a few weeks to see if I could walk in my heels instead of just carelessly just handing me my dress. Thank you Rosa for waiting for my response the week of my wedding and understanding just how important it was for me to be able to wear my shoes. Thank you for everything.</review>

Made an appointment to try on formal dresess and the lady that helped me was nice but not very helpful. She gave me 3 dresses that weren't in my size. And that was it. I felt like she wanted to rush me out of there. The dressing room was smelly and in need of updating and someone had food that made the store smell like strong parmesan cheese. Not a very good experience< /review>

Dress is beautiful, but staff is so unorganized. They tell you one thing and don't communicate it to the other person. So when you get there no one knows what is going on. 2  1/2 hours waiting on a dress they said is ready....very frustrating.</text>

<review>Felt completely unwelcomed and uncomfortable.
I went in to purchase A Maid of Honor dress, for my sister-in-law's wedding. She had just bought her wedding dress here a week ago and had an amazing experience. I, however, did NOT. The "host" was rude and sassy. Plus, he didn't seem like he listened to me when I told him what I was there for at all. I, MYSELF, had to find someone and ask them about the dresses and if I could try them on. When the woman finally found me, she seemed focused everywhere else, but on what I was there for. I did FINALLY find a dress that I will accept, but am not 100% happy with. Would have been appreciated to have more curtsey shown to me and my bride when we went. Slightly appalled, to say the least.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1491671831165, 'text': 'Hello Sandy, we are sorry to hear that your experience with us fell short of your expectations and that our staff did not seem attentive.

<Review>Had a great experience at Davids Bridal! My first appointment I had Jimmie help me with gowns. He was amazing! I told him what I liked and what I absolutely did not like and he had amazing style. He found me a dress that I absolutely loved. I was going to get that gown however when I came back with my parents a couple days later we all had a change of heart and I ended up selecting a Oleg Cassini ballgown which was absolutely gorgeous. It was way above my budget but luckily my parents are going to help.  Awesome experience!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1485289072366, 'text': 'Greetings Alycia, congratulations on finding your dress!

I had a great experience with my stylist Fabiola at the Long Beach Towne Center location. She was super sweet, caring and knew what styles to pull for when I expressed what I wanted out of a dress. I truly appreciated her help, especially feeling overwhelmed and unsure if I would find the one. She is such an amazing stylist, Thank You Fabiola!!!</text>

< Review>
The first day i went in it was a really great experience, i was able to find my dress which i loved!! Made an appointment for a sunday afternoon so my mom, grandma,and cousins were able to see just that one dress, but it took 45 min for the lady to come back to me. She kept saying shes almost done, 2 more minutes but if i wouldve known i was gonna be waiting almost an hour i wouldve scheduled it at 2:30 instead of 2. But once we spoke to someone there they sat us down and got my room ready right away. Overall i still left a happy camper!<//Review>

<text>Horrible experience. I didn't have an appointment, understandable, I went to the section that I thought adequate for what I was looking for and asked a team member if they worked there and if so if I could try on a dress; she showed me to a fitting room but not once did she check up on me to see how it fit or if I needed a smaller or bigger size or even a different style, I changed and walked out of fitting room I walked out of the store and the team member in the front didn't even acknowledge me leaving. Such a shame, their loss not mine.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1499360345174, 'text': "Hello Anna, we are very sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your experience.

The girl that helped me did not listen to my opinions and constantly talked about how bossy my mom was. Of course the mother will share opinions; she should know better than to disrespect the mother of the bride to the bride! Poor customer service and an untrained staff...I definitely won't be getting my dress here!< /text>

I had an absolute wonderful experience today!  I walked in with a warm welcome, and felt vey comfortable from the start. My stylist Britian, greeted me smelling really good and had big smile on his face.  He was helpful, very honest , funny, very well educated on the dresses and styles that he brought out to me.. I felt beautiful and loved every dress, it was hard to decide. Thankfully Britian was very organized . That was my first experience trying on a wedding dress and I have to say I left a happy bride!!!! Cant wait for my second appointment with my friends to share the joy!! Thanks David's Bridal Long beach towne center!!!</text>

The consultant and reception employees I met with on my initial visit were very pleasant and helpful.
Randi was my consultant & she was knowledgeable of their dresses and helped pick out more dresses to try on. She didn't pressure me to buy anything that day. Also informed me of the sale going on & when it would end. After spending about 2 1/2 hours trying on dresses, she sat down with me, gave me a run down of how much everything would cost and answered all my questions I had.  She was very patient and wasn't trying to rush us out the door since we were there 30 minutes after they closed ... just asking questions! :)
If you can choose your consultant, I would suggest Randi! :D</Text>

<date>1495341924378</date><rating>5</rating><review>Firat things first... DO NOT read the bad reviews and assume your experience will be the same! I read all the negative reviews the day before my appointment and it ruined my night! I was so worried! Let me tell you how amazing my experience was.

Fabiola was amazing! She was extremely helpful with listening to what style I wanted and even gave some great suggestions without over stepping an boundaries. She helped me in and out of dresses without making me feel uncomfortable or rushed at all! She was extremely kind with my friends and family who were with me and listened to their thoughts and opinions as well. The good news... after 6 or so dresses I found my amazing dress!! (Cannot post pictures yet..sorry)

I also decided to try and find my maid of honor and bridesmaids their dresses here and again Fabiola was so kind and patient with my bridal party! She brought us so many dresses to try on and gave some great recommendations as well.

Lastly, when picking up my dress about 6 weeks after purchasing, I met with Brenten(I may have misspelled his name sorry) from alterations and he was such a gentleman! He helped me in and out of my heels and gave me great advice about what alterations I should do on my dress! He helped me walk through the area with my dress and veil to be sure they were perfect! I will be seeing him again in September to finalize my alteration decisions.

Listen ladies... understand that this staff is amazing! They really do try and accommodate everyone while following guidelines and procedures along the way.<//review>< Pictures>

The place is going down hill. Some of the dresses look dingy and old. Some of the employees look like they rolled out of bed and ran there. How can you take someone's opinion seriously when they don't care enough to take care of them selves?< /text>

< Review>
Let me start with I am most grateful to Aileen for such great costumer service!

I had a moment where no bride wants to be😠😢
I went in for my first fitting in alterations, I had the vision in my head of how my dream dress should fit me, but the seamstress had a complete different one. I'm petite size 2 and on the short side 5'1 so I'm aware that most gowns are designed for tall. With that being said I had my idea of what i thought could be done so that the drop and fit of this mermaid/fitandflare gown would be right for me, but all i got was a big "No!" Let's just say we weren't meeting eye to eye on this. So of course, with my wedding being next month(felt pressured) I thought to myself let me just let her do what she says she's done before with this gown. So I paid and left her the gown and went home.(big mistake! Don't Ever Give in Brides! This is our Big Day! It's Our Gown!)
So next morning, I gave them a call to stop the alteration process (Aileen answered) I explained to her why, her tone of voice and apologizing made me feel good about coming back and seeing a different seamstress( I still felt overwhelmed and unsure if this next lady would see my vision and understand my body)
Well as I walk in I was greeted and walked to alterations met with Dolores and she's such a nice lady understood everything and agreed because of my height the drop needs to be a bit higher so I'm able to walk normally instead of doing the penguin walk 😂 all she had to do is confirm with another awesome seamstress Chi if it will be possible? Chi's answer "Absolutely! What the bride wants, we will do" Wow! that's all i needed to hear! They will be altering my gown to look like my dream dress😍
p.s I'm a size 2 with cup 32 C with a 0 waist that's why taking it in and giving it shape was a must!
5'1 height in mermaid/fitandflare drop was on my knee that's why raising the drop was also a must so Im able to walk!

Well Aileen, Dolores, and Chi Thank you so much! I'm now excited and can't wait for my last fitting!👰😍

Overall my experience here was excellent because of customer service! (maybe the seamstress I met with the day before was just not having a good day) & Yes I could've spoke up the first time but after getting a few "No's!" knowing myself its best to go home and return at a later time 😂
So, Ladies if something isn't right or someone is just not seeing eye to eye with you speak up or run for Aileen! Lol 😂<//Review>
