I always have a great experience here with Brandi. Not only does she do an outstanding job with my hair, she’s a pleasure to talk to and she’s a great listener!! I never have to worry that she’ll cut too much of my hair— that’s something that has happened with someone else at another salon a long time ago. Everyone at Anasa is kind and welcoming- they aren’t pretentious. I feel comfortable and welcome every time I come in.</Review>

If you are looking for a professional, clean and welcoming salon, then Anasa Hair Studio and Spa is for you. The service here is exceptional along with the quality of Stylists at your disposal. I am partial to one, and that’s Brandi, the owner. She is FABULOUS! I love supporting local businesses, and this is MY hair studio. Brandi is a Wonder Woman.< /review>

Love my new hair!  Brandi did an amazing job at improving both my appearance and my confidence.  It was hands down the best baby-free 4 hours this Mama has had in 2 years! Thank so much!< /Review>

<Text>The whole staff is always nice, helpful, and knowledgeable about their products and there are many different hair products to suit anybody's specific needs and wants.  My favorite stylist is Melinda a true professional and the only stylist I'll let cut my hair. I've switched styles and colors several times but never left unhappy. Always good prices and products. I'd reccomend everyone to go check it out and I bet you'll leave feeling like a million dollars.<//Text>< Pictures>

This is the best hair place, although I know they do nails as well. I think they also do massages. I had moved away and am now back in the area and wouldn't consider going anywhere else. Friendly people and they are fantastic at what they do! Even I look good, which takes a minor miracle.  ;-)  If you haven't been here before you should definately give them a try!</text>

New to Lake Elsinore this past year and found Brandi through reviews on Google.  Her cuts are excellent, which is most important to me.  She is also very skilled at cutting my partners wavy, thick hair.  He has had a hard time finding someone to cut his hair correctly and she nailed it the first time!<//review>

LOVE Brandi.  I come in with these random wacky ideas in the color department and she delivers every time!  She also makes great suggestions if I seem to be getting a little crazy with it.  She cuts my special needs son's hair as well and is to sweet with him.  She even got a smile last week. :)< /review>

<review>I am kind of disappointed with this salon... I was expecting the stylist to know a little more, she was good but my hair Still has major split ends and the colors that I wanted to do, she shot it down and so I had to settle For something I didn't really want.<//review></record>

The salon owner did not know what a bayalage was or just how to do it. She even admitted to me that she doesn't keep up with the latest trends and when they do try, the look at YouTube videos. So sad

Update: my response to the owner:
(It has been almost 2 years, So I am over it now) however, you responded.

There is no reason for me to lie about what she told me. She did say they would watch YouTube videos to keep up with the trend, but that was even she or they felt it was necessary. That was the moment I wanted to get up from the chair... I do regret not leaving that chair. After my “balayage,” I trusted her when she said that it would look good and stand out in natural lighting.   Anyway, there was one chunky highlight and nothing else. So, yes it is So Sad that I had to give this review, but that is your own fault. Train yourself and your staff to keep up with the latest techniques, I hope you never have this problem again because it’s our hard own money that we are giving you.
Anyway, I found a great hairstylist in riverside after the incident at this salon.< /text>

<Text>I was tired of my "old look", so I returned to Anasa after a 6-7 year absence. Amanda took care of me, asked me what I needed, and my response was, "I want to l leave here looking much different than I came in". I walked out of the salon with a brand new look - new color, highlights, and even a little purple and green! Amanda took her time changing my look; she is caring, friendly, and so talented. When she was finished with my hair and I got to really take a look, I cried at how beautiful it was. Amanda not only changed my look, she changed the way I looked at myself!</Text>< pics>

This place is awesome! I am usally really sceptical of going to a new place because I have had a lot of bad experiences with my hair in the past. Not here. They were aware of the fact that I get very nervous and treated me so well. I had Brandi do my hair and she talked me through it the whole way. I would most definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. They did an amazing job cutting and styling my hair! I am very pleases and that is a rare thing when it comes to my hair! Awesome job!</Text>

< Review>
I spent many years working in the salon industry, and have really only found maybe 3 hairstylists in my life whom I like, and would be a repeat customer to. Tristin at Anasa Hair Studio is FABULOUS! I have a thick, curly mop of hair which I have spent years trying to control...and she has transformed it into hair that I love! I get more compliments since having her do my hair than I ever have when I had it done at other places. If you have hair, you need Tristin.<//Review>

After reading reviews on this page I decided to call and make a appointment with Brandi to get a hair cut and wax done. After my wax I went home bleeding, swollen and in pain from my skin literally being torn off by the wax. I was missing chunks of skin that ended up scabbing over on my face FOR DAYS. I called the salon and they said they spoke to Brandi regarding the situation but she reqested to call me back. I received ZERO calls back!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!<//Text>

The hairdresser, (manager)  arrived late for 3 of my scheduled appointments.  The last time, she was over 20 minutes late arriving to the salon.
Extremely poor customer service.<//review>

Make spirits at this place was horrible I wouldn't go there if I were you there's plenty of other places that would treat you better and have good stuff as well and the people that work there are stuck up and think they know everything. They are not the place to go if you like to be treated well<//text>

<Review>They are cool cats. Shop been here for a hot minute. Alot of folks don't realize wildside smoke shop and purplehaze are one in the same. You can always talk your way into better deals or if anything they will try to hit you with Lines to lead you into thinking you're getting a hook up.

<Review>Great selection and really nice staff, this is the only shop I use because the staff remember me and always seem happy when we walk in even if we arent buying anything. I've bought both of my mods, my three bongs, and like 10 pipes from purple haze and even when my best bong broke from a defect they sent it off to get fixed for free because they know i only shop at purple haze for all my smoking needs.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I bought a Smoke Novo 2 from this place the other day. Was told it would work with the normal smoke novo coils. I specifically told the employee i had purchased several BOXES of the mesh coils for the original Novo with the button. Come to find out it’s a a completely different coil. He could have checked, but instead he reassured me it was the same coil. Wasted 50 bucks for this thing and now have literally a BOX of coils for no reason</review>

<review>Great local vape shop.

Pros: friendly & knowledgeable staff, competitive prices, excellent "rebuild" setups, good selection of juice

Cons: doesn't carry certain juice (not really their fault as a store can't carry every brand)

If you are interested in getting into vaping or you are already vaping, Vape Dreams is must "visit".</review>< Pictures>

I am lucky to have these guys around the corner from where I live, because everybody there is very knowledgeable about anything vape.

They always have the latest mods and latest tanks and are stacked with coils. They also offer help to change coils and juice,

They are one of the only store that carries Five Pawns  which is my favorite juice.

Just wished that the Hollywood store would have the same closing hours than the Koreatown location,

Thank you for providing such a great service.  This is a one stop shop for all for vaping needs.< /Review>

My step father's vape broke when it got Malaria on our scientologist mission trip to Africa, thankfully the noble gentleman who runs this fine establishment was able to take all the nasty third world juices out of it and fix it. Very nice!</text>

Great communication, i.e., customer service!  I ordered some paint from them that had to be mixed at another Jerry's location.  As soon as it arrived, Sean called me to let me know that it had arrived and when I could pick it up (with the new shortened hours due to C-19).  Great service all around!< /Review>

< review>
I used to work at a trucking company and these guys sent the wrong materials and ruined a huge job. The sad thing is we had the driver call them to let them know and 3 employee's and the owner's son verified it was the correct stuff. I wouldn't go there unless I was painting a bicycle I didn't care about.</review>

I was pleasantly surprised that I was greeted and helped in an exceptionally friendly way. Even though I had shown up four minutes before the stores scheduled lunch time. (Note: they close from 12-1 So avoid that time frame, I had no idea and was lucky I didn't have to drive back later) The gentleman that helped me was patient and told me everything I needed to know. I appreciated the information and help! The stuff I needed was not available at the Sacramento location, so he called in my order for me to the Placerville store and told them everything I needed. Which was great, cause I don't know the lingo. When I arrived at the Placerville store the next day, I was again welcomed by friendly faces. This company just seems to be filled with great helpful people. So much so, I wanted to take the time to write a review. If you need paint and supplies, this is the place to go. I will be a customer for a long time.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809ad99de17b9af9:0xe04fef6c29e653be<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

These guys are awesome! I own a body shop in Madison Wi. We work on Saturdays. Good luck getting a person on the line from Dupont when their website goes down. Even harder. Try getting ahold of anyone in the Midwest after noon on a Saturday. I have cars that I absolutely need to paint today. I called these guys out of a random internet search. Even though they knew they were going to profit absolutely nothing from dealing with me they went out of their way to pull the paint formulas and faxed them right over. Great customer service! As an industry professional I appreciate it!< /Text>

If you are looking for a well educated and affordable dentist to ensure the best possible care of your teeth then this is the place. The staff is so friendly and my teeth have never felt or looked better! I couldn’t believe the dental chairs have a massage feature and the option for relaxing music. I normally dread going to the dentist but I can’t wait to go back! There were no surprise bills or unexpected financial costs which is one of the reasons I avoid the dentist. They were very understanding and helped me find options that worked for me and my budget because I wasn’t covered by insurance but in desperate need of quality care. Thank you so much for a great experience!</Review>

<Review>I love love love my experience here. First time as a patient and wow! I’m so impressed by the compassionate staff from the receptionist, the dental assistant Fereshteh, my fabulous and kind hygienist Nira, and Dr. Javdan. I came in wearing shorts and a small midriff top because of the heat wave outside not realizing that it will be 20 degrees colder inside. Although they were out of clean blankets at the time, Fereshteh still accommodated my cold self by giving me a gown to use as a blanket which actually worked! Nira my hygienist was incredibly gentle! She is so knowledgeable about oral care that she taught me so many amazing tips on how to maintain my oral health plus how to keep my teeth white. Her hands are also as light as a feather! Never have I ever had a teeth cleaning where my teeth were in pristine cleanliness minus the trauma from the ouchies during the procedure. Thank you so much, Nira! Dr. Javdan gave me an honest opinion as he answered my questions about fixing the misalignment of my teeth. He is an expert on Invisalign and offered me a great deal on doing a study for four weeks to try. I have yet to come back and do the procedure but I feel so confident already in wanting to pursue this route because of his honesty. I’m so glad that I chose Beverly Hills Prestige Dental for my oral care ahhhh I highly recommend!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Date>1600450450734</Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I was not planning on writing a review after my first bad experience at Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group. But after a second even worse experience I decided that I wanted other people to know to listen to the negative reviews you see here as they all are true.
First of all, please be aware that they WILL try to upsell you on things you don’t need. I was told that I needed an antibiotic treatment due to an gum infection in my mouth.  I was pretty shocked by this because I have good oral hygiene- but of course when a professional tells you something like that the first reaction is to trust them. However- in retrospect it really did not make any sense. They gave me a small tray of foam to put on my teeth and I held it there for 30 seconds or so and took it out. If I really had an infection that would not have really helped, it was just a way they could get an additional $50 out of me. At the end of my appointment, which other than the upselling was fairly standard, they told me I should see a gum specialist due to gum recession and said they had a great doctor in house, Dr. Pedram Fakheri.
My second appointment at Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group with Dr. Pedram Fekhari is when things got even worse. After inviting me into my dental chair fairly quickly after my arrival, they kept me sitting there for 45 minutes. Normally I would be understanding o this- however there is NO PARKING at Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group. So you have to search all over the area for street parking and the best I could find was 2 hour metered parking.  So if your appointment is long and they have you waiting for a long time the meter will expire and you will get a parking ticket.
I finally went back to the front desk to see what was going on and right then they said he could see me. On first meeting him he began peppering me with condescending and rude trick questions. For example “what are you doing here”, “is gum recessing bad”, “if something does hurt it means t’s not bad for you, right?”. It’s hard to convey through text how strange this was in the moment. You expect a specialist dentist to be warm, kind, and thoughtful not arrogant and rude. Then he proceeded to pull up google images on the computer to show me examples of gums- strange since I can and did do that at home before the appointment. Lastly, he only looked at my mouth for about 20 seconds to identify which gums were receding and told me a needed a gum graft surgery. At this point I was feeling very uneasy and skeptical that he would suggest such a drastic surgery without even measuring the depth of my gum pockets or even closely evaluating teeth for longer than a couple seconds. He went on to say I need to decide whether I wanted to use cadaver tissue or my won for the surgery, making sure to say using cadaver tissue would make his life easier. I was chocked and creeped out to have this conversation about 5 minutes of meeting him. I told him I need to think about it more before committing (really just trying to escape and get out of there) and he told me that “yeah you need to do more research”.

Overall I cannot recommend this office and particular do not recommend Dr. Pedram Fakheri. They will upsell you, try and get you to do things you do not need, and will condescending you in the process.

PS Dr Pedram Fakheri also had really bad, bad breath you could smell through his mask. That’s a cardinal sin for a dentist- gross.</Text>< Pics>

I was extremely nervous about having my teeth cleaned during the pandemic since I have not left my house since mid March, (except to get a flu shot and another shot and for my daily walk). Prestige Dental is taking many precautions. They take your temperature when you arrive. When you are shown in, masked of course, everyone who works there is masked and more. My hygienist was double masked and with an added facial shield. The chair was wrapped with plastic changed after every occupant. Everything was sterilized. There is an air filter on the counter of every examining room. You are asked to swish hydrogen peroxide in your mouth for 30 seconds. After all of these precautions, I felt both safe, relaxed, and very impressed with everything they are doing to keep their patients safe. Even before the pandemic I definitely recommend Prestige Dental Group. I like how they explain everything before they do it and how they go over the expected charges before they start. This is an A-1 operation.<//text>

<Text>Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group was a group of exceptional professional human beings. Nira the dental hygienist was simply amazing. They brought me into the examination room right away and everything moved along pretty well. Dr. Javdan was very kind and down to earth. I felt comfortable with this dentist office. The quality of care was amazing. As a medical professional myself, I understand quality service when I see it. I was upsold on a deep cleaning, but I had never had a deep cleaning done and so I felt as though it was necessary for my dental hygiene. I would recommend this dental office.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2bbe3b95f0eb5:0x8ccb7997bc6e01bb< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have never been more blown away by a medical professional staff in my life.  I've been going to Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group for years.  I like it because the dental hygienist has a soft touch, doesn't make me feel like I'm being "up sold" for unnecessary work and makes me feel like they actually "know" me.

Further, Dr. Javden is efficient, straight forward, and extremely detailed in his exam and explanations.

I recently went to my cleaning during Covid and was quite anxious until I reached the office. It is clear from the beginning that this group of professionals is taking the current condition extremely seriously - and still with good graces and a familial style.

I've been so impressed with this office that I was able to coax my friend who has severe anxiety and fear of the dentist to finally go for a cleaning.   Once the front office found out that she suffered from anxiety, they took extra care to bring her a cool beverage, check in more frequently, and overall leave her with a very positive impression.

Seldom does a medical practice come together to give you the full ensemble and this office delivers in spades from the front office to all the specialists in the back and the doctor himself.

Thank you Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group for delivering such outstanding and consistent service.< /Text>

Best dentist I've ever been to. Dr javdan not only provides excellent care but he takes the time to educate you on how to care for yourself in a very personalized manner.  I have had nightmare, horrible experiences with my past dentists and I can only say that over the past 3 years , I have only had an excellent experience with him and his office staff. They were also very strict and professional with their covid protocol which was nice to see . Highly recommend</Review>

Exceptional services and no complaints whatsoever.     Staff members were friendly and professional.  Dr Javdan took me as an emergency patient and stayed after 7:00 pm to perform a root canal.   I was in severe pain and he was very meticulous in diagnosing the exact source of the pain and then explaining to me my options of saving the tooth.   Other dentists had recommended pulling this tooth but he was able to save it and instantly remove my pain.   I am forever greatful.   I highly recommend him and I am definitely going back.< /Review>

This was the first time using my new dental insurance since going onto my partner's plan. Julie must have spent 30 minutes on the phone with several different insurance agents trying to verify my eligibility. In the end, we were unable to do so (I had mistakenly given her the wrong info).

She knew I had been waiting to see the DDS for dental pain and they offered a free consultation to find the *root* of my discomfort. While Dr. Javdan was doing the examination, he identified the source of the pain and thoroughly explained the cause. He gave me several treatment options to work with, discussing the upfront costs, so we could find the right plan for me and my budget.

At checkout, Leaka helped me apply for my CareCredit promotional payments so I can avoid interest payments for the first 6 months. She also made sure I left with the additional items recommended by Dr. Javdan, which included a prescription toothpaste and gel for teeth sensitivity. I even got a free Extra Soft toothbrush to keep me from brushing too hard.

I'm glad a friend recommended Dr. Javdan's office to me, and I look forward to completing my treatment plan with Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group!</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Went in for a first time cleaning and Dr. David Javan’s staff was really great, friendly and caring. The dental hygienist especially took the time to answer any questions or concerns I had as I had a lot of plaque that was all able to come off, and the same went for Dr. Javan. I got a very thorough cleaning. For me, a friendly caring staff means everything and so for that reason I would go back. Thank you for taking the time!</Text>

<text>It is so hard to find a good, trustworthy dentist in  this big city, but Dr. Javdan and his team are one of LA’s best kept secrets. Nira, my dental hygienist, was so thorough and wonderful to me. She made the deep cleaning feel like a spa treatment and kept asking if I was doing okay. She gives the best cleanings I’ve ever had! Dr. Javdan is patient and honest without trying to force you into unnecessary procedures.
I highly recommend this practice for all your dental needs!!!</text>< Date>

I hated going to the dentist but everyone here is so nice and they talk to you through the procedure so you know what to expect. But honestly once they’ve numbed your mouth you don’t feel a thing anyway. So happy with all of the work I’ve gotten done here and would recommend to anyone.< /text>

<text>I have been a patient at this office for about two years, and I have been consistently treated with the upmost respect and care from the front desk to the Doctors. I had a complicated surgery recently and the Doctors were sure to communicate with me through the process as we were going along, and they kept me informed and calm the whole procedure, which took over 2 hours. The Doctor also had to preform surgery on my gums amidst the primary procedure because he saw that there was a fracture. This is complete care. I have been to a lot of dentists, but Beverly Hills Prestige definitely is Prestige! I’m so grateful to have met this doctor and I am
Honored to highly recommend him for any of your dental needs. Dr. Javdan is the best!< /text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pics>

I have bee going to Dr. Javdan at Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group for a few years.  He is a very competent, conscientious and nice dentist.    All the staff are friendly and professional.  He is currently working on my 2nd and 3rd implant after extractions with bone grafts.  I would not hesitate to refer friends and family to Dr. Javdan.< /Text>

Amazing team of professionals who are great and passionate at their jobs. Always ready to help and answer questions. Dr. Javdan is beyond great and super friendly. He is extremely skilled at local anesthesia amongst every other dentistry service there is. I went to him with a failed root canal (from another doctor) which had some complications as well. No only he confidently dealt with the complications but also did an amazing job implanting a tooth that will last me for a life time. Highly recommend Dr. Javdan and his team.</review>

<review>I give Dr. Javdan and Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group 5 Star. I absolutely love Dr. Javdan and his staffs, and  definitely the best dental care by far.  Prior to finding his practice I went to a couple of awful dentists in Los Angeles and one dentist almost had me believe my teeth were going to fall out.  Luckily I found Dr. Javdan who performed wonders for me.

My root canal was painless... did I say painless.  I actually fell asleep during the procedure and hopped out of the office without any discomfort other than my slightly numb mouth from the Novocain.

Dr. Javdan and his staff are very kind, accommodating and their work is absolutely excellent.
If you are looking for a dentist who is honest and provides excellent service I definitely go to Dr. Javdan.

Dr. Javdan is a very good man, and great Doctor. The girl who is the dental hygienist is always prompt and thorough. My teeth are blinging when I come out.
I actually look forward to my appointments there... and I hate the dentist!

Dr.Javdan is the best dentist I have ever seen.  I used to go to him without insurance and although it was all out-of-pocket for me, it was worth it.  I then got an HMO plan and saw another dentist in Beverly Hills and it was awful.  I ended up spending more money there with insurance than I did without at Dr. Javdan's office.  I stopped seeing the other dentist, switched to a PPO and am happily back with Dr. Javdan.

The staff is super friendly and Dr. Javdan is extremely professional, intelligent and caring. Comfortable office, friendly staff.  Plus they keep up with the latest in dental technology - which I didn't think was an issue until I started seeing him and realized my old dentist sucked.

Keep on smilin'.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>So grateful to have found a wonderful dental practice. I chipped my tooth during the shutdown and Dr. Javdan was kind enough to come in and do an excellent repair. Fantastic safety precautions were taken, and Dr. Javdan was so patient and ensured that I was happy with the result. Had a cleaning yesterday by an excellent technician. They took their time explaining each procedure, and they are so kind. So glad I found this place!</Review>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Short version: Dr. Javdan is a perfectionist who is passionate about what he does and goes above and beyond for patients. His office is efficient, has risen to COVID challenges, and are always very transparent about billing and working with patients.

Long story: I originally went to Dr. Javdan in 2018 for a second opinion on a failing root canal. While my other endodontist wanted to save the root canal, Dr. Javdan patiently explained there was only a 20% chance a new root canal would last and then the tooth would have to get pulled anyway. I was nervous--I've never lost a tooth and no one else explained all of this so thoroughly!!--so he went above and beyond and showed the X-rays to another dentist to get a third opinion.

The office squeezed me in before the holidays. Dr. Javdan extracted the tooth and it was very infected; he was right that a root canal certainly would have failed and put me out unnecessary money.

Dr. Javdan always makes me feel like I am in great hands and explains things in terms that are easy to understand. After several visits, I can say with confidence that he is an excellent dentist. I literally get people oohing and ahhing over how good my new implant looks and I feel confident it will last a long time. Thank you, Beverly Hills Prestige Dental!<//Review>< pics>

The front desk staff has been especially flexible with my schedule which I appreciate so much!! Plus they have their own parking garage so it was convenient to come and go (no dealing with street parking if you don't have time).

Dr Javdan is the best dentist I've had since I was a kid!  I moved to LA 3 years ago & went through 2 other dentists before I found him.  He is SO great at explaining everything (I had to have 5 crowns replaced over the past year & he's gone above & beyond to work w/ me on timing & which one should be replaced first, etc).  His staff is great - full of smiles- and the office atmosphere is wonderful.  I HIGHLY recommend him to anyone looking for a new dentist.  He'll be mine for as long as I stay in L.A.- for sure.< /review>

< Review>
Dr. Javdan is not my regular dentist but I ended up choosing him to do my dental implants. He’s the 4th dentist that I consulted with for my implants. The procedure was a breeze. During the procedure, he was explaining what he’s doing and intends to do. After each procedure, he asked the technician to take the X-ray so he can check if everything is okay. Dr Javdan is very good at what he does and he’s a perfectionist. He goes above and beyond just to make sure everything will be okay. Dr. Javdan and his staff are all great. I highly recommend this clinic. Thank you.</Review>

<Review>I am a new patient of Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group, and I am very impressed with this practice.  The front office staff are very friendly and very well organized.  Making an appointment was easy, and I was seen on time.  Paperwork, insurance and billing matters were efficiently and correctly handled.

I came in for an exam, X-rays, and a cleaning.  Each member of the professional staff was courteous and very proficient.  I believe that this was the best cleaning I have ever received.  Dr. Javdan reviewed my current dental health with me, and made good suggestions on how to improve it.< /Review>< pictures>

5 stars for the best hygienist: Nira!

0 star for the worst billing clerk: Aricely.
She never replied to emails.
Double dipping, take the full amount from me & then from my insurance too.
I asked her to email me my credit balance & she never replied.
Every time I went there, I had to spend hours arguing with Aricely about the billing.
I lost wages. Because of her I was hours late to go back to work.
I went to many dentists, this place has the most unprofessional billing.
She didn’t give receipts for what I was paying for.
She handwritten her calculation & keep it for herself.
Even after I asked for a copy, she still didn’t give me.

05/06/21 Went back to get the crowns, a huge mistake!
I made appointment 2 weeks ago. Just a day before the appointment, the receptionist called to cancel because she didn't review what my appointment for.
If a patient cancelled last minute like this, they will be charged cancellation fee.
After I complained, she reinstated & quoted me in 2 different calls, my balance $700+.

I went there for 3:30 pm appointment, someone else, not Dr Javdan, doing the impression & unscrew the implant caps.
Not until 6 pm, someone asked me to pay $1,440. I asked to talk to the receptionist or Ariceli, but they left 5pm & didn't bother to find me to confirm the price.

See my picture, why all of the devices are rusty & dirty???

Also 6 pm, finally dr Javdan saw me & he insisted to grind my upper tooth. So today trip was completely wasting my time. They have to do the impression all over again at another day. Very unprofessional.

Also they only give a receipt from credit card payment, but not for what are you paying for. Only in this dentist, I never get a treatment receipt. Again very unprofessional!<//Text>

I went in for X-rays, and did a full exam and deep cleaning. Had a great dental visit. Staff was very welcoming and nice from the reception to the dental hygienist. The final cost was a fair and reasonable price.<//Review>

Found a true Gem
I found Dr. Javdan through a friend and I am so lucky  to have found him.
I had a bad experience at a very young age with another dentist and was always afraid to go.
I hadn't been to a dentist for a few years when one of my teeth started hurting me.
Dr. Jadvan and his amazing staff were wonderful and put me at ease. I especially love their hygienist Anita, she is wonderful and now I look forward to getting my checkups.
I highly recommend them.<//Text>

I have been going to Beverly Hills Prestige Dental for almost ten years. During that time as have always received excellent dental work from Dr. Javdan. Not long ago he was able to save one of my teeth from being pulled out after a filling fell out and it was a pain free experience. The dental hygienists are also top notch and are friendly and welcoming.

Another great aspect of going there is that the office staff is helpful and they are accommodating. When you schedule an appointment, you get email and text reminders in addition to an appointment card. On the few occasions when I have had to reschedule they were helpful and understanding.

Whatever you get done here will be excellent whether it be routine cleaning, fillings, more extensive procedures or even a custom mouth guard. Since I grind my teeth while sleeping, Dr. Javdan fitted me for a custom night guard that fits like a glove. As a bonus, every other part of your experience will also be outstanding so I wholeheartedly recommend them.< /text>

<Text>I highly recommend Prestige Dental Group to anyone who is searching for excellent dental care. The staff was so friendly, making me feel right at home. In addition to their caring attitude, the staff was also very professional, and I knew that I was being well taken care of. I recently had a tooth that was bordering on requiring a root canal. Unlike other dentists, Dr. Javdan was reluctant to perform a root canal and even saved my tooth! I am so grateful to Dr. Javdan and his entire staff for the excellent dental care they have provided me with until now!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I've had extensive work done with Dr. Javdan and have never had a bad experience. The whole staff at Beverly Hills Prestige Dental has made what has been a horrifying year from an oral health standpoint a relative breeze. I actually look forward to going to the dentist now. How weird is that? But it's the truth. Everytime I go there I know I'll be taken care of... And that's exactly what you need from a dentist.< /Text>< Pictures>

I initially found Prestige Dental through a groupon. I was a little hesitant at first but was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked my overall experience. The staff is extremely nice and accommodating, and the Dr really goes out of his way to help you and give you the best service.<//Review>

I've been dreading going to the dentist. My last two times with my previous dentist left me traumatized and pissed. Luckily I came across Dr. Vazquez on my insurance and decided to switch over.
As soon as I walked in I felt very comfortable and at ease. All the people there are very nice and friendly, but not the fake customer service friendly. It felt genuine, like they really cared. They all took their time with me to address all of my concerns and questions. The cleaning was what I was scared of the most, but it was a comfortable experience. My last dentist would leave me in so much pain I wanted to cry.
I'm a grinder, so we discussed mouth guards and instead of pushing one on me right away, he said to take my time (well not too much time since grinding isn't good) deciding on which one would work best for me and my budget. My last dentist, each and every time I went she tried to push something extra on me that always cost more, I would leave pissed and feeling robbed.
Street parking was pretty easy to find. There is a structure but it can get pricey if you are there for long.

So HAPPY to have found this office and now I will look forward to my next checkup.</Text>

<Review>Basing the review on the work done, which has always been terrific. Dr. Javdan is also very nice as well and will always show you what is wrong so you understand the concept(s) on a basic level, which helps.

As a note: It does tend to get a little upselly, which patients should be aware of. Product of living in a capitalist society, I suppose. Just decline if you don’t want a service, like anything.</Review><userid>100382768900909852249< /userid><gmap_id>0x80c2bbe3b95f0eb5:0x8ccb7997bc6e01bb</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I just had a crown done by Dr. Javdan and I am so happy that I switched over to his dental office. He is an amazing Artist, extremely detailed oriented and has patience like I have never seen. You can not ask for more caring dentist. I am grateful and will never stop going to him. Luckily he is younger than me so that I will always be able to go to him with my dental needs.< /text>

<Review>I have been going to Dr. Javdan for years, and he is truly an incredible dentist! He is so professional, and at the same time friendly, which makes going to the dentist actually pleasant! He recently fixed my front teeth which I had previously chipped and I am beyond happy with the results!! My teeth look absolutely perfect and I am so happy with my new smile! And It’s all thanks to Dr. Javdan’s expertise!

100% recommend!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This review is based on the work done by Dr. Javdan.  Without a doubt, Dr. Javdan is one of the best in dental care and cosmetic.  A lot could be said in your smile and he provides the best care in the precision he puts in his work.  I've gone to a lot of dentists in the past, and I've learned over the years that sometimes paying a little more is worth it for your dental work.  I had an onlay done 6 years ago, and this year it decided to fall out.  I set up an appointment with Beverly Hills Prestige and they were able to set up an appointment with me.  Just make sure you let them know that you don't want to wait when making an appointment so they could find the best time for you to come in.  Parking could be a pain if you have to wait for along time.  After a few visits, I had a new onlay in and it looked way better and stronger than the one I had before.  The quality of his work and the materials used is top grade and I could tell this tooth will stay in place this time.  Thank you Dr. Javdan for improving my smile and making sure I could eat again!</Review><GmapID>0x80c2bbe3b95f0eb5:0x8ccb7997bc6e01bb< /GmapID><response>None< /response>< name>

<Review>A good dental office.

The positives are the dentist is nice and does a thorough job explaining things, I really liked my hygienist who seemed like she cared a lot and it's convenient that a gum specialist also works in the office.

The bad is that as someone mentioned previously they try upselling you on everything -- often for unnecessary services and they are very expensive.

I personally wouldn't go back but I didn't regret going here.< /Review>< pictures>

Dr. Javdan is a thorough dentist who does excellent work. He discovered issues with my teeth that other dentists had either been unaware of or ignored -- issues that could have spelled the loss of teeth down the road. Not only did Dr. Javdan find these problem areas, he treated them expertly, painlessly, and with a final result that looked perfectly natural. Dr. Javdan also is a pleasant person with a good sense of humor who, as a clinician, is responsive and informative in a respectful way without ever making a patient feel blown off or condescended to. A first-rate dentist.<//review>

Dr. Javdan is an exceptional dentist. He is extremely caring, professional, and ultimately talented in dentistry. He and his office staff are always friendly, welcoming, and kind. Working in healthcare as a nurse, I have very high standards in the healthcare providers I choose. I truly acknowledge and appreciate his care and his professional dental abilities. I had an emergent dental issue just hours before leaving the country for a medical mission and he stayed after hours to accommodate and help me.

I’m truly grateful for Dr. Javdan and his staff and would highly recommend for all preventative, cosmetic, and treatment based dental needs. 5⭐️</review>

< review>
Better late than never. I had a regular cleaning scheduled in January. I chose Dr. Javdan based on the reviews I saw here, which are largely positive. My appointment started with 14 xrays. Never in my life have I had so many xrays done at the dentist. They said 18 is for the full mouth, but they only did 14, which is pretty standard procedure. My standard is 4 xrays, not 14. I assume it’s a result of dated equipment.

I then met with the hygienist, who is super sweet, gentle and very educational. She explained in a lot of detail what is happening and why. This was great, but there was also a lot of repeated information and it took a lot of time. As most hygenists do, she explained the proper flossing technique, which involved going up and down 5 times along the tooth on each side of the gums.

She recommended a deep cleaning, which I was on the fence about due to cost and the amount of time it’d take. They gave me a cost break down, which was nice. They said the basic cleaning involves an antibacterial treatment, which is $95 out of pocket. I asked if I could have the cleaning without the antibacterial treatment and they said no because it was somehow incorporated into the rest of the cleaning. I chose to go with the basic cleaning and told them I’d think about doing a deep cleaning when I have more time since the appointment had already been well over an hour long. So they proceed to do the cleaning. Turns out the antibacterial treatment is entirely separate and could easily be removed from the cleaning.

The hygienist who taught me the proper flossing technique hardly even flossed my teeth. The floss went in and out, not even rubbing the teeth on either side once, let alone 5 times. It’s the fastest cleaning I’ve ever had. Probably took 1-2 min total for the brushing and flossing combined. Then the dentist came in for 30 seconds—opened my mouth, looked in, said it looks fine and asked as he was walking out the door if I had considered braces to which I responded that I’d had them and that they messed up my jaw. The latter part of my response about my jaw should have sparked some questions, but that was it. Appointment was done, so I walked out.

I scheduled another appointment and asked for an 8am appointment whenever there was one available. The receptionist scrutinized my request asking why I need 8 am and such rather than simply giving me the dates where 8am was available as I had already told her I was flexible with the date. They also do not validate for parking. Paid an extra $17 for parking since the appointment took 2+ hours. 2+ hours for a subpar cleaning. Definitely have no plans on going back.< /review>

Best Dentist in Beverly Hills and greater Los Angeles Area. He’s very affordable and is probably the most educated dentist you will encounter. He’s not pushy at all and tries his best to always help you and prevent issues< /review>

This Doctor is Awesome!

First off i am one of those sick people who like going to the dentist, but Dr. David has always come highly recommended via friends and family.

He's honest, gentle, and a riot to have work on you! his goal is to get you the best work possible and he's only done that for me. He doesn't yank you around and try to get it all out of you like some dentists are unfortunately known to do.

Ur the Best ....<//review>

I have been very satisfied with Dr. Javdan, he is very honest and professional. I came to him with problems that were in serious need of attention and he helped me with every single one and now I have beautiful teeth! He had corrected several issues I had with dental work done at another office. Dr Javdan takes pride in his work and will make sure that the patient is happy. His fair prices and his professional work is what brings me back every time. When I am in the office I know that I am in good hands!!!</Text>

RUN from this office!

Office staff is incompetent.
Hygentist doesn't know how to clean teeth and upsell's.
Dr. tells you to go to USC, even though you have insurance!
You wait FOREVER to be seen.

I came here for my dental implant. Doctor Javdan and his staff were kind, prompt, and professional. Dr Javdan explained to me in simple terminology what will happen with my implant. My implant  matches the rest of my teeth so flawlessly I sometimes forget which one is my implant!  I highly recommend this office to anyone who is looking for top notch quality dental care.<//Text>

I am writing this review about my wonderful experience with Dr. David Javdan as I feel compelled to share it with everyone who is looking to find an awesome dentist. I have known Dr. Javdan for the last 15 years and throughout all of those years Dr. Javdan, his office staff, technicians has remained consistent at providing spectacular client service. I would say that from the time I sign in with the front office personnel and all the way to the last interaction with Dr. Javdan the customer service attention that I am provided is simply superb. Whenever, I go for a teeth cleaning or for any other dentistry service; the front office staff, technicians, dental hygienists, and anyone working at Dr. Javdan office make me feel like a family member returning home. I honestly feel that way, as they treat me courteous, with respect, with a nice smile, and I don’t have to wait long to be seen. Also, it is worth mentioning that if I am running late or need to change my appointment time, the office personnel is very helpful, flexible, and they are able to meet my needs every time.  Another factor that contributes to my superb customer experience is the fact that Dr. Javdan’s office is always impeccably clean, sterile; and he employs state of the art technology for any dentistry service offered and performed at his clinic.  Lastly, I have to tell anyone who sees this post that my family and I feel blessed and fortunate to have found a Dentist like Dr. Javdan, as he gives me peace of mind that for any dentistry issues he is there for us.</Text>

<review>Dr. David Javdan and the Prestige Dental Group is a trust worthy excellent dental office! At all my visits, Dr. Javdan and his team were very friendly, accommodating, professional and made sure I am comfortable with all the dental procedures I had to go through. The dental procedures I had are as complicated as a tooth implant, and as simple as teeth cleaning. No matter how simple or complicated the procedure was, Dr. Javdan and his team obliged, and did a tremendous professional job. I recommend for anyone whom need dental care to go to Prestige Dental Group for treatment. They will do the job well, and you will leave the visits with a smile.< /review>< Time>

<Text>Dr. David Javdan and the entire team at Beverly Hills Prestige Dental Group are the most amazing, professional, top notch dentists that I have ever been to!  I had not seen a dentist in 5 years and was really scared of how much the work I needed would cost.  I've never had a more pleasant experience at a dental office.  They explained everything to me in great detail and made me feel extremely comfortable and at ease.  Their prices were more than fair.  I was fitted for a night guard and thought it was going to be a clunky uncomfortable device and that I would not be able to sleep in it.  Dr. Javdan had a very small, soft guard made for me and quite frankly, it's like wearing nothing at all.  I give them 10 stars, and I highly recommend them!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I recently had my 2 upper wisdom teeth pulled out by Dr. Javdan and he was super professional, kind, and did an amazing job. I had zero pain during the procedure and he constantly asked how I was during the procedure. He also gave me tips and supplies to use during the week after the procedure to help with any pain or normal bleeding. I would definitely recommend Dr. Javdan to anyone needing any dental care!<//text>

Thank you Dr Michel Vazquez !!!!!!! I am so pleased with the great work you have done for me in your office. Although I am probably not a “good” patient, I am most grateful for the time & energy you put into making me feel comfortable. I look forward to hear from you  in the near future about your great dentistry and helping those in need.Even I know I don t have a  good insurance because is an HMO you did not care about those things which make you even a better professional ,I would strongly recommed your services to anybody that ask for great comprehensive dental work.Looking forward to meeting you and your awsome staff again for the affordable price of  $ 139 for a Zoom Whitening !!!!!! :)))))))<//Text>

For someone that really hates the dentist the staff and Dr. Javdan worked with me to help fix my mouth. They were so patient with me and apologize for how many times it took to do the x-rays ! I highly recommended them!< /review>

Dr Javdan recently went ubove and beyond the call of professionalism in making a full set of dentures into implants. I have and will continue to recommend him.< /text>

<Review>I'm writing my honest review, hoping it will help others in the search for a trustworthy professional dentist and hygienist! We all know dental office is a place we never want to go especially if it's far too from where you live, and i got to say i don't drive over the hill for anything, EXCEPT for Dr. Javdan and his lovely expert hygienist, Anita! I've had bad incomplete root canals and crowns on a tooth that should have been root canal first done by my previous dentist in Irvine which caused me not to be able to eat with one side of my mouth for months without knowing what was the problem! To be said, that it doesn't matter if you have $$$ but if you don't spend it in the right place and don't get it done by a dentist who knows exactly how to solve the problem and knows exactly what to do then no matter how much money you spend, you will never be happy or released of pain and misery that you are experiencing! Dr. Javdan got all that misery and pain gone for me in just two visits! I've had whitening and other procedures done with him which i'm very happy and satisfied with. WORDS aren't enough to explain how KIND, PROFESSIONAL, AND COMPETENT Dr. Javdan, his sweet hygienist, Anita is! The staff and his assistants are really warm and friendly; the office is always clean and up to date and they all together do an absolute fantastic job to keep you and your precious teeth on check! Having a beautiful smile brought by having beautiful teeth tells you that a MAGNIFICENT and BRILLIANT dentist is behind it! I highly recommend Dr. Javdan and his staff to everyone who is looking to find the BEST dentist and a cosmetic dentist!!!< /Review>< pictures>

<text>WORST DENTIST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD

The first time I went to Dr. Javdan was for a chipped tooth. He filled in my tooth but I could still feel that it was not bonded smoothly. I told him it didn't feel right and he dismissed me responding, "I don't see anything," without even looking at my tooth with the overhead light. I left feeling he was rushing to be done with me and was unbothered with my uneasiness about his work.

4 months later I notice there's brown spots on the tooth Dr. Javdan bonded. Not only did he not smooth my tooth properly, he also left air bubbles on the tooth that turned brown.

So I returned to him so he could correct his work.
Dr. Javdan was very rough when he started to repair my tooth. He was gripping my top lip with so much force it went numb and caused my lip to swell. He finished and I could clearly see he had not buffed the whole tooth, he just buffed in one spot. This made the tooth have an obvious spot polish look in one spot on the tooth and not on the whole tooth. I told him that it didn't look good and once again he responded, "I don't see what you're talking about." I told him it wasn't right and had to really insist. Annoyed he said, "Do you want me to put more bonding on?"  Why is he asking me instead of repairing the tooth in whatever capacity that he sees as fit to get the desired look???  Unprofessional.

I told him that he forcefully held my lip and now the left side of my top lip was swollen. He responded, "what happened to your lip?" and I said before you started working my lip was fine. He kept saying I must be allergic to latex. I told him I was not allergic and that he used unnecessary force. Yet he NEVER apologized, just claimed I was allergic and was really unsympathetic about the situation.

At this point there was no way I could sit back down in his chair when he was so blatantly unconcerned about my comfort and/or dental well being. When he left the room I went to speak to the manager, Aracely.

I showed her my lip and tooth and she agreed that both were not good. However, she kept insisting I let him fix it. I told her that I did not want to be in the room alone with him and that I was uncomfortable.

Dr. Javdan over hears us talking and starts insisting that I let him continue working on my tooth. I said, "No, I'm done." He responds, "just come and I will fix!" and he comes over to me and starts repeating, "just come and I will fix," at this point I have told him NO a few times. Instead of him giving me space and accepting that he has lost a client, he comes over to me and invades my personal space...

He's STILL insisting I let him finish fixing my tooth and I turn to him and say NO firmly. He CONTINUES to try to pressure me to come back to his chair. To get away from him I walk out of the office side and into the waiting room side, in an attempt to remove him from my personal space. He sees that I'm past annoyed with him yet Dr. Javdan then follows me into the waiting room. Saying, "I want to see if you're allergic to latex." I shout "LEAVE ME ALONE!" and he laughs sarcastically and goes back into the office side.

At this point I'm so upset that I'm crying. I ask the manager Aracely did she know of any other dentist that she could refer me to - of course she didn't know of anyone else.

The experience I had with Dr. Javdan at Beverly Prestige Dental was more than disappointing and unprofessional - it was devastating. I left the office in tears with a half buffed tooth and swollen lip.  The absolute worst.</text>< Pictures>

< review>
In my experiences with other Dentist in LA I never felt like my dental health was actually being taken in to concern until I found Dr Javdan.  The entire process of getting two crowns put on my teeth was both incredibly thorough and painless.

The wonderful women at the front desk were so pleasant to deal with and took the time necessary to explain to me my dental benefits from my insurance so that there were no surprises which I really appreciated considering how difficult understanding insurance and treatments can be.

I really felt like Dr. Javdan went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and informed about the procedures he was doing and how he was doing them.  I was consistently asked if I was experiencing any pain so that it could be managed but that was never the case.

Most of all I felt like Dr. Javdan cared more about making sure my teeth were healthy then trying to do a bunch of unnecessary things to make more money which was my experience previously in LA.  When my insurance ran out and I needed an additional consultation with an Endodontist he saw the concern in my face knowing that I had just spent all I could to get my teeth fixed already he arranged for the consultation in his office with  Dr. Mansouri who treated me as just as kind and caring as Dr. Javdan did.

I am moving to Colorado now and having finally found and incredible dentist here in LA I feel like its important to write a review like this for all the people out there like myself who were searching for the right fit but didn't know where to look.  Thanks again Dr. Javdan and Dr. Mansouri you make all the difference in the world with you talent and generosity.  I would give me recommendation Dr. Javdan at the highest level.< /review>

Dr. Javdan and Beverly Hills Family Dental have been my dental group for 10 years! They are truly my dental "family". Dr. David Javdan is the most caring, considerate, precise, perfectionistic dentist I have ever had! As an actress, my smile is very important and Dr. Javdan goes above and beyond to make sure my teeth are healthy, clean and white. I have had dental and cosmetic "emergencies" over the years and Dr. Javdan and his team have made sure I was helped and repaired as quickly and efficiently as possible! You will not find a more helpful and caring dental team in Beverly Hills and I refer all my friends and business associates. Thank you, Brooke Lewis<//review>

I absolutely love Dr. Javdan- definitely the best dental care by far.  Prior to finding his practice I went to a couple of awful dentists in Los Angeles and one dentist almost had me believe my teeth were going to fall out.  Luckily I found Dr. Javdan who performed wonders for me.

My root canal was painless... did I say painless.  I actually fell asleep during the procedure and hopped out of the office without any discomfort other than my slightly numb mouth from the Novocain.

Dr. Javdan and his staff are very kind, accommodating and their work is absolutely excellent.
If you are looking for a dentist who is honest and provides excellent service I definitely go to Dr. Javdan.

Dr. Javdan is a very good man, and greaaat Doctor. The girl who is the dental hygienist is always prompt and thorough. My teeth are blinging when I come out.
I actually look forward to my appointments there... and I hate the dentist!

Dr.Javdan is the best dentist I have ever seen.  I used to go to him without insurance and although it was all out-of-pocket for me, it was worth it.  I then got an HMO plan and saw another dentist in Beverly Hills and it was awful.  I ended up spending more money there with insurance than I did without at Dr. Javdan's office.  I stopped seeing the other dentist, switched to a PPO and am happily back with Dr. Javdan.

The staff is super friendly and Dr. Javdan is extremely professional, intelligent and caring. Comfortable office, friendly staff.  Plus they keep up with the latest in dental technology - which I didn't think was an issue until I started seeing him and realized my old dentist sucked.

Keep on smilin'.</text>< user_name>

Most of their pastries don't seem appealing More cozy with the outside dining, actually. Coffee drinks are good , but everything seems pricy here. All of these types of places are. You can easily spend $7.00 on a glass of coffee drink here and at other places<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

But they are for "free loaders" who treat this place like a public library and refused to spend a penny!!! As far as our coffee prices go,  there is nothing on the menu that cost $7.00 a cup!

<review>Homey small Cafe in Arcadia that's become my favorite place for a quick lunch. They have a good selection of different coffees, pastries, and paninis.  They have added a number of breakfast bagels. I love sitting at their small tables outside. Some days, it's just what you want!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Great coffee. After moving here from Seattle, I'm glad I found this place! They brew Jones Roasters (local roaster) and the food is excellent too!  Salads are great quality, along with their baked goods.  Staff is wonderful and the patio and ambiance is great!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Love this cafe’s vibe. The music they play is not too loud and has a calming effect. Sometimes I’ll dig certain cafes but they’ll have music on way too loud, which can be distracting. But I was able to get in the zone and study for hours at this place. Also, their iced Vietnamese coffee was delicious :)</text>

After asking her for the wifi, she told me "I already gave it to her" (she was talking about my friend) with an attitude. Then, when I sat down, she comes up to one of my friends who didn't order and asks her to order something when I already ordered something. I don't understand why there seems to be a policy that each person must order. The lady then walks back to the cash register and stares at us while we're sitting. Overall, my experience was terrible, and I immediately left after the incident happened, not staying at the coffee shop.

The best staff this side of the Mississippi!  I tell you what....I can come here and feel just like I'm back home on the ranch with all the little critters running all over the place.  I like the nice patio in back; makes me feel like I'm back in the Catskills having a good coffee with Ma and Pa!  I enjoy the pastries like a possum likes summer squash on a hot summers night...OK now!<//Review>

Its ok but  I like Starbuck s better but there's none around here this place is ok but they cook everything in microwave not healthy at all I come here only when I go to the doctor office down the street.its a clean quiet place and the employees are nice to everyone.🍳🍝☕<//review>

{'time': 1533448536275, 'text': 'Hi Pamela,  Thanks for the great review !  We don\'t cook "everything" in the microwave.  Perhaps there is a misunderstanding.....  Yes, there is a microwave.  But, we have a panini press which we make all the panini.  We have a toaster which we make the bagel sandwiches in..... We also make our own dressings, spreads, salads and other stuff.  Starbucks has every food item DELIVER to each stores.  I don\'t mean to compare us to them because they are a multi billion dollar corporation, and we are just a tiny 700 square foot neighborhood shop trying to survive for the last 18 years.  Thank you again Pamela !'}< /Response>

HI Pamela - Starbucks sucks and your tastes are that of a typical simpleton.  If you don't like this place go back to Starbucks and enjoy your rancid overpriced sugary coffee, so thanks for saving me a seat on a busy day:)  Anyway - this place is great, they carry Klatch Coffee, and have great pour overs and other specialty drinks.  But their main attraction is their food, from paninis to salads, their food options are delish!<//review>

Not to mention good coffee. Not quite as many alternative milks as Starbucks, but they do have soymilk, so I can get my dairy free lattes.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<rating>5</rating><Review>First time getting my windows tinted. I called around to get some price quotes and ALFA TINT had the best prices. The owner is a great guy and he explained all the different brands and shades of tint. The lounge area was  nice and clean and the wait time was only 1.5 hours. I highly recommend this shop for anyone looking to get their windows tinted. Thank you</Review><userid>116135715605731535697</userid>< Resp>

<Review>Did an amazing job. In three words- fast, focused and professional. Tinted the windows, and had a clear bra installed on the front clip. Knows his product and has talent for installing it. I've found my tint guy, not going anywhere else from now on.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Got my first window tint done on my 2004 Audi A4, and I loved it! Definitely a work of someone who knows what he's doing. The price was good and the work was amazing, definitely recommending this place to anyone looking for a good quality tint job. It's funny to read all these reviews complaining about the price, hey if you're so retarded to think that a good tint will cost you a little money, then you're an idiot, and you don't deserve to get your windows tinted. Just like it says on the wall in Simeon's office: "Cheap tint isn't good and good tint isn't cheap" Remember people it's quality over quantity but if you value quantity over quality then go get that $99 tint job that won't last you a week!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjT8YddlsbwECIJECf6rkN7v1KAljQki5i2g6k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLuXGEJVQfD2K4C-bKFwUzL3FbX4vokVrG97iM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGMi8SbtzWXwyQ0bxWvkL58RJXDkyvjY1hUa5K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

I chose Alfa window tinting and do not regret my decision. High quality service for the best price. I got my headlights and fog lights tinted and will be coming back for my rear windows in the summer time. If you’re having doubts, give Simon a call and he will assure you of his guarantee.< /text>

Nothing but great things to say about Alfa tint. Gave me the best price in town and also was very patient going over the different tint types and tint percentages. They use high quality film and offer ceramic as well.
Over all very satisfied with this shop. And will bring my other vehicles here.
Clean shop< /Review>

What can I say, Alfa Tint is the best. I just brought my 3rd car for window tinting and the job is amazing like the past 2 vehicles I owed and had done by Semon.  The guy is a Gentleman and informs you on what is best for your vehicle. I have also purchased 2 Tint for my younger brother,  thats how much I think his of his ! I would go anywhere else.  And I live in SF.....So thanks again.<//Review>

<review>The only tint shop that I take my cars to. I used to go to other shops that advertised really cheap prices, but the quality of their tint was just horrible. At Alfa, Sam only provides top quality tint. He's also a very quick and efficient worker. You can tell that he loves what he does. I've found my spot, and I'll keep taking my cars here. Plus I love that I'm saving hundreds by not going to the dealer or one of the big name tint shops, but I'm still getting the exact same quality. Stop missing out, and bring your car by!<//review>< Pics>

I have taken many cars to Alfa Window Tinting including: BMW M3, Toyota Camry, Toyota Prius and a Smart car all of which were done perfectly. The owner is a really nice guy, works alone and has lots of experience so you know your tint will be done flawlessly. It’s easy to contact him and book an appointment. He always does a great job and I have not been disappointed yet.<//review>

I had my 95 Chevy truck windows tinted at Alpha tint and the installation is perfect, the install was fast, great customer service, he has a great talent, his cut lines are razor sharp very very detailed. and price was right for my budget.  i will recommend Alpha tint to friends and family i will return for more of their services.
thank you Alpha</text>

So this is a dated review, I say that because i had my car tinted couple years back. there isn't any bubbling on the surface or tears. The tint is excellent. I'll be buying a car within the next year or so and guess where i'm going to get a tint; Alfa of course. This place has my business 100% and if you're looking for a place to get an amazing tint, you have found it.</Text>

I recently took my 2013 Mercedes CLS63 for a chrome delete. He used a gloss black vinyl to wrap the window trim, tops or the door handles and the front grill. He gave me a more then fair quote and he got me in a few days later. He did a great job and my car look amazing!<//review>

Got my car done here and my semi truck. The owner offered the upgrade of using ceramic tint and I already had it on my car for 2 years and just got it done on my truck, also he does amazing job on clear bra with headlights and fog lights. I referred many friends and family to him. He'll take care of u. Research on ceramic tint because that stuff is amazing. He also does regular tint any shade. I've had a cop look at my front window tint in my car it was 70% and he said wow your tint guy is good cuz he makes the tint to the edge of the window so it almost looks like the window came like that. The cop let me go lol</Text>

I saw many pictures and reviews about this tinting place and decided to take my BMW 535i for a full tint to be done. I have been to many tinting shops and this shop tinting was done very professional . Shop is clean and professional service. Would take all my cars to get tinting done!!!< /Text>

On 10/24/17 I went in to see Sam from Alfa Window Tinting ask him how much it would cost to do my two front windows on my truck ! He gave me a fair price so ask him when he could do the job ? He told me to come back at 1:00 pm which I did ! He said one hour and they would be done and they were . Great Job and Good Price !
Thanks Sam for the Great Job

I remember having major anxiety before my lasik procedure but it was all worth it when it was done and over with. I went to see Dr. Chebil over in Orange County and she did phenomenal job with my eyes. It was so unbelievable being able to see again without having my contacts on. Thank you again to her and her staff for taking care of me and changing my life forever.<//review>

The manager’s appearance and demeanor was unprofessional.  He would not honor a valid coupon. Said we declined vacuuming and washing windows but we were never asked. Never checked brake fluid or transmission fluid. Said that lighting system was ok but never had me turn on the lights.  My husband is disabled and I count on Jiffy Lube for the safety of my vehicle.  I will never go to Jiffy Lube again.<//review>

Just a scam they said I needed brakes. My brakes had over 85% left when I confronted the mager said we must have made a mistake. They will say your vehicle needs something just to make a sale very dishonest.Picture of new pads next to my old pads that they said needed to be replaced.</review>

On October 28, 2020 I took my car to be serviced at this location for an oil change. My car had no leaks prior to this day and was in good condition. The oil change literally took 5-10 minutes I noticed it was a little odd but didn't think anything of it because this was my third time bringing my car here. Not even a whole month later November 25, 2020 my car gave up on me on my way to work. I brought it to my mechanic and he said there was no oil whatsoever in the car. He advised me to call Jiffy Lube and they deny that it has anything to with their service I forgot to get the name of there person that I spoke to on the phone but I asked for his corporate number and he just gave me his boss number like if that's going to help. Now my engine blew up and I have to pay $2000 to replace my engine when I shouldn't have to. My mechanic refuses to touch my car because he doesn't want to mess it up any further unless he finds out what they did to my car. I've skimmed through the reviews and I noticed that I'm not the first to complain about an issues like this. One guy went into depth about how they messed up 2 of his cars and the owner never responded to the review. Why is that? He responded to almost every other review ...   I don't recommend especially this location. Take your money to Valvoline down the street!!< /review>

Im not very happy with these people. I went in for an oil change and the staff was friendly and they had me in and out within 25 mins. But 2 days later my change oil light comes back on and immediately after that the check engine light comes on and car starts acting funny. So I pull over and check the oil since the change oil light just came on. And nothing literally nothn on my oil dipstick. They didn't refill my oil. They r lucky my engine didn't seize bcuz of their negligence. I do not recommend go in there< /review>

<Text>I bought a car at an auction and it was really bad from the engine and it would have trouble starting. I came to this spot and they hooked me up with discount. There were things that would cost me and arm and a leg with other mechanics but here my wallet was safe. I recommend this place to anybody. They tell you what's wrong with the car and you decide if you want to pay for it or not. By  Antonio H.< /Text>< Pictures>

I had  been coming to Jiffy Lube since I bought my first car and I gave this location a try and that was my mistake. I was so upset with the service I received. Due to the pandemic I was told I had to stay inside my car at all times which is fine I understand so I put my trust in the staff with my car and they turn around and brake some things and don’t even tell me. The employees were careless with my car and broke my prop rod and broke a clip that was attached to my ac hose. I was shocked because after they broke it they left it in a random place underneath the hood which could potentially have messed up my car. I ordered the parts that were broken through the dealer, but I can honestly say I will never bring my car to a jiffy lube. It’s minor things that were broken but the fact that they “finished” service and didn’t even tell me makes me so upset. My thing is if they didn’t know how to handle my vehicle they could’ve asked me and avoid this carelessness.</text>

I said once before that I would never take my car for an oil change at Jiffy Lube from a previous horrendous experience and a ruined car. After nearly 20 years nothing has changed. Due to Covid19 I was needing a oil change and decided to take my Lincoln in for a oil change and that seemed to work out well at first (this is what I thought, will come back to this car later) so I decided to bring my Saturn in for the same thing, before they started I explain if they are not familiar with the process for this car then I will tell you that this drain plug must have a seal and if it's not installed correctly then it will leak also that their is baffles in the valve cover that only allows you to pour oil in slowly. This information was not heard, they acted as if they already knew. This was as far from the truth, when the work was done I left but moments later I smelled burning oil and pulled over, opened the hood and found oil all over the engine and that oil poured right on top of the catalytic converter and was smoldering ( this is how Jiffy Lube ruined my other Saturn caught on fire) so I returned and they attempted to clean of the oil with water and air, this did nothing, I returned home to find oil leaking from the plug that I explained About the seal. With My previous Saturn I returned and their fix was to keep tightening the plug untill they stripped oil pan and the plug, (oil pan and plug had to be replaced at the dealership) so the seal is there for a reason. Now the remody was to have a second and third opinion for the work was not performed correctly and also found no torque wrench was used to set the specs on the plug. I filed a compliant with the BBB and Bureau of Automotive Repair over the work and to make matters worse, remember the Lincoln I took in the beginning of this issue? Well it turns out on inspection of that work, the oil was changed but not the filter, the dirty, filthy, old filter that was on the car since the last change (by Firestone auto service) was still on the car, so that makes 2 cars with problems now after going back to Jiffy Lube. Never Never Again. Once this is inspected by the state so this can be documented. I will never return to any Jiffy Lube. I guess If your not a car person, then what you don't know won't hurt you, but it may cost you a lot of extra money and Time. It's just not worth it.</Text>

Best service I've ever received in these establishments. I highly recommend this place. I don't know if it was the manager or just another worker but this guy was great. He gave me great advice on my vehicle and thoroughly explained what they were going to do to my vehicle.  I've been to these places about 4 times and again, this place has given me the best service.< /review>

<text>Very deceitful employees.
I went in for an oil change and to check what the check engine light was marking. The assistant manager told me that there was water evaporating in my transmission and I needed a flush, that it would fix the problem, so they did the flush and didn't do it correctly. I had to go in the next day because there was a lot of transmission fluid leaking and wait over an hour for them to fix it again.
Then the day after that my engine light turns back on. I go in an again it's an evaporation issue, but it has to do with the gas, NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THE TRANSMISSION. So now I have to go get the problem fixed by someone else because they can't find the problem.
So they lied to me to get to purchase a transmission flush and didn't fix a damn thing! I was lied to and they didn't fix anything!
Now all they can do is fill out an incident report and make me wait another week to hear back from them. Deceitful and very unprofessional.</text>< Pics>

Went in because of the $29.99 oil change special they were announcing outside their store. I have been to this location before with no issues but this time they tried to charge me $89.99 because they were going to use synthetic oil for my car even though I had not requested it. There was no mention of the 29.99 special I had asked about when I pulled in, they instead charged me $55 for the synthetic blend. However, the man who talked to me about my car brought out a dirty cabin filter and suggested I change it along with the engine air filter despite having replaced these myself that same week. They also tried pushing me to make other updates/modifications to my car when I only asked for an oil change. Only upside was that the oil change was quick and they topped off my fluids. Overall I don't think I'll be returning to this location as it seems they're only after the customers' money.< /text>

I have always had the associates "top off" whatever I need in the car, i.e. antifreeze. This time, I went to get my oil change, the associate asked if I wanted "antifreeze" in my reservoir (spelling?) topped off -- since it was filled with water. That is strange, because last time -- I had it topped off with antifreeze (that was 3 or 4 months ago)  (ha?) I trust them with my car – should I not?<//Text>< Gmap_id>

They serviced my car surprisingly fast despite taking more time (30%-50%) than estimated. I was a last minute, early evening Saturday walk-in and did not expect to get my car serviced that day. I did think that was the most I paid for an oil change (>200%). The break down was ~$70 oil and ~$50 labor. Service includes a fluid inspection but any refills are extra. They could not find the fluid tanks in my car and despite telling me they would look into it, they almost let me leave without verifying that all fluids were full. I also noticed that they wash the window exterior and vacuum the car. They did a barely noticeable job on the windows. I saw no indication that the car was vacuumed. My car was to be cleaned after I did some work on it, and I noticed my oil dangerously low. I think that if a company includes superfluous services, they should fulfill them properly.<//text>

This location just taking advantage of customers. They said I need front brakes they never looked at them. They said I was down to the metal my brakes had over 85 percent left, I took my car home removed the pads took a picture of them and returned to the shop to show them, manager said oh service people must have made a mistake.<//text>

<text>Poor service! Actually, no service, they didn't want to do an oil change on my car. I tired calling the service center to ask what exactly was the problem on my car so I can let another center know and they left me on the phone forever. I continued to call and never got an answer back.<//text>< pics>

<review>First time trying Uyghur food, and I wasn't disappointed. I was referred here by a local, and man was I glad I made the drive out. The Lambs feet were delicious, but understand when ordering it that it's the foot, so there isn't a lot of meat. But all that collagen makes the broth healing. The meat pie was delicious, too. Can't wait to try more from here. The house made yogurt is a must.</review>< Gmap_id>

Omar Restaurant is a great Xinjiang stop that is delicious and unique.

Currently during the pandemic (as of 4/10/21), indoor dining is not available and they unfortunately don't have an area set-up for outdoor dining. They do have a big parking area available and you'll be ordering through their backdoor entrance. At 2:00PMish on a Saturday, things were quiet (my friend and I were the only customers). We were greeted by the owner, who cooked our food in about 15 minutes. I forget if they were cash only but would advise to definitely have cash on hand just in case.

We both got the lag man (the hand-pulled noodles). There were plenty of noodles and was absolutely delicious. It comes with a big container of the spicy oil, lamb, and veggies (would advise that for two people, should probably get either a second order or another entree on the side). Even taking the food from the SGV back home to the OC, and slightly reheating the items, it was still super delicious. The spice isn't too hot (about a light medium) and it definitely filled me up!

Definitely would suggest to stop by if you love noodles, lamb, and more! I asked the owner's son how business was and he said that things were fairly so-so and haven't changed much since the start of the pandemic, so if you've been a fan in the past or think you want to give it a try, definitely support Omar's Halal Restaurant!</Text>

<userid>115161603850417728115< /userid><Rating>5</Rating><review>Never had hand pulled noodles specially halal. I wasn’t disappointed. Gravy in noodles is unbelievably rich and smooth. You won’t know the difference of hand pulled noodles and just commercial noodles until you taste it. They mostly have lamb items. If you don’t like lamb, I suggest you should go somewhere else. Their price is not very expensive comparing to the quality of the food. Customer service was very good. You can see they are making noodles in kitchen from where you see!! I believe they are family restaurant. Young kid was taking orders and helping his parents and sister. I like the deep fried lamb most. If you can’t eat spicy food, let them know when you order noodle.</review>< Resp>

<review>Big plate chicken with hand pulled noodle is what I came here for. The noodle is flat and super long that covered with the spicy chicken sauce. One plate is good enough for two people. The lamb broth was good. It is tasty to dip the naan into the lamb broth for the flavor. Small restaurant and don't expect too much from the service.< /review><rate>4</rate>< Pics>

<review>One of the best China Islamic restaurant in the SGV!  Chicken pull noodle (order w/extra noodles), fried lamb w/cummins, meat pie, and xinjiang noodle a must!!!  A bit pricey but considering the labor & quality ingredients behind the preparation, TREAT YOURSELF to a full-flavored scrumptious meal!!!!  You will agree it's worth each penny that was ponied up.</review><date>1610477195927</date><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2dab44131a9bb:0x70d9bd3b5269d592< /gmapID>< user_id>

<text>I liked lag-man and hot&salty milk tea! Lag-man can be better if made a little bit thinner, but in general it was very good! As I used to eat in Kazakhstan.
Lamb kebab was very small, I would say tiny  4 skewers were not enough for 1 lady with small volume of stomach.
We would definitely come back because of lag-man, but would not order kebabs any more. Would like to try Big plate chicken with noodle and meat pie on our next visit!
Parking space for few autos is available to customers for free.
Only few tables are inside - this place looks like someone's home from Asia, but it is cosy and authentic. I felt myself like I am a guest here.
Waiter is not really fluent in english, but she got the idea of what we would like to get. Also we had a chance to see how our dishes were prepared by the chef. Now I want to learn how to pull lag-man by myself.
P.S. pay attention that this place is not working from 3pm till 5pm each day and on Tuesday!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH5m1y-C3yY794OGTf25p45_GLDlnL4HU30Jam=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPC7B76udYg0RIZ74f5kYby8dfLbpqjZBlPB14x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2dab44131a9bb:0x70d9bd3b5269d592< /GmapID></record>

A real family-run restaurant (very impressed with the young son multitasking like a professional host/ server).  I had my first Uyghur meal ever, and enjoyed the lamb skewers, the hand drawn noodles, the soup (I believe there is only one on the menu; it was great), and of course the much praised big chicken dish. The yoghurt was sweet and tasty. The salty milk tea something to have experienced once.  Quite A display of regional art/ craft,  but don't come for high class (the restaurant ran out of chairs when we were there with a group of 10).  No alcohol served. Great experience.<//text>

2/26/2021– happy to report that Omar is still open and still serving really superb, fresh, made to order food! Last night we tried the spicy cold chicken for the first time, very well balanced with a nice spicy kick. Layman and meat pie remain standouts.

Support this local gem!

Always great Xinjiang food! The big plate chicken is impressive, but I love the delicately flavoured and springy lagman noodles, the fragrant meat pie, and the very fresh and well-balanced vegetable salad<//Review>

<review>food is great, price might be a little towards the high end but for the most part it's worth it. service on the other hand feels a little lacking. I understand they're a small family run business, but I've been there like 3~4 times now and each time, the server, even the boss lady, all seem like they're rather tired. they're not rude or anything thou, mind you. anyway, still worth a visit if you like good food.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Excellent authentic Uygur food. I had l(烤羊肉串 grilled lamb skewers)
and Uygur lagman  (手拉面hand pulled noodles) and both were very delicious and tasted just like the ones I had in China. Great Halal food made by our beloved Muslim brothers and sisters. Highly recommend this place.<//text>

I went here with a couple of buddies and was blown away by EVERY dish. The service was amazing. Our server was a 12 year old boy in roller blades. Hahaha! Small, and cozy vibe. Like hanging out at Grandma's house. It's A Asian Halal spot. Get the MeatPie!<//review>

< review>
I highly recommended the hand-pulled noodles ( I can also attest that they really are hand-pulled because I saw them do it). The garlic cucumber was also way better than I expected.  It might have had something to do with the 100+ degree weather but I really enjoyed the cucumber.< /review>

< review>
We had lamb flat cake, lamb clear soup with noodles, tofu, and big plate chicken noodles.

Pros:
+ Halal Xinjiang food, not too common in that area
+ Colorful decor
+ You can hear grandma making noodles in the kitchen. Noodles had nice chewiness to them. Good sauce, lots of depth

Cons:
- a bit crowded
- Their service is kind of an acquired taste. It didn't bother me but some people in our party said they wouldn't come again b/c of the service. I thought it was fine - it's not "professional," but it reminded me of when you go over to your aunt's to visit and she forces your kid nephew to help serve you dinner and he would rather be playing video games and doesn't really want to see you anyway. If you think of it that way, you start finding it funny and growing a bit fond of the experience.

Overall, would come again for noodles.</review>

<review>Food was so great. The big plate chicken is the signature. Also the kababs are good. It can get a bit busy there and parking is limited. But there's always plenty street parking outside.< /review><Date>1519884179249<//Date>< user_name>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>It is impossible to get this kind of food in the U.S. There are several restaurants billing themselves as offering this kind of cuisine, but this is the most authentic. Delicious food. Owner is great. Very small, intimate space serving a rarity for the U.S. Next date I have, it'll be here. Get the 'da pan ji' if you like chicken.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Small family owned restaurant with a friendly staff. I've never tried xinjiang style Chinese cuisine before. Make sure to ask the waitress for recommendations.  The things she recommended were all fantastic.  Will definitely go back with more friends so I can try more dishes!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Big plate chicken with noodles is one of the best.  Service and space leave room for improvement.   All in all a small mom and pop restaurant.</Review>

<gmap_id>0x80c2dab44131a9bb:0x70d9bd3b5269d592</gmap_id><review>Came here because Bon Appetit mentioned them in a recent article and since I wss in the area...This is a small restaurant located on the main street (4 lanes) in the area.  The food and the service is unpretentious - come in, order, and eat.  No ceremony, no discussion of The Vision.

The spicy ox tripe is tender but not that spicy (I think they didn't believe when I said make it hot), mixed with cilantro for a nice contrast to the tender, chewy tripe.

The cumin lamb was chopped and thoroughly cooked - probably more than it needed.

The naan is not the Indian naan you are probably familiar with.  This is more of a dry biscuit.  But that's good because it's perfect for absorbing the meat juices and oils from the cumin lamb.

Nothing earth-shatteringly exotic here, but still a good, filling meal.</review>< Time>

We walked in to be greeted by the cold stare of the waitress, the customer service was below average with the cold stares she gave us. We didn’t feel welcome. We ordered the naan, chow mein, and lamb kabobs- and they were WAY overpriced for the portions!!! The kabob was the size of your finger, the naan was 7 dollars and the portion size was RIDICULOUS!! The chow mein also barely had any meat in it. The flavors of the dishes were average, but the naan was too hard. Also everything was a little too greasy for my liking. Overall pretty dissatisfied.<//text>

The significant other and I used to live in China. Our city had this great Xinjiang restaurant we would visit frequently and it's one of, if not the, biggest thing we miss about China.

We've tried to make their signature dish, the Da Pan Ji, or Big Plate Chicken, a few times at home. Omar Restaurant completely blows our attempts out of the water. It's everything we remember Da Pan Ji to be. We completely devoured it between the two of us. You MUST order a side of naan to soak up that  delicious sauce.

We also ordered the lamb kebabs and a lamb pie. Disclaimer - I'm not the biggest fan of lamb to begin with so I was pretty lukewarm about it. The S.O. enjoyed them though.

I would probably move back to the SGV area in a heartbeat just to be close to this restaurant and its Da Pan Ji.</review>

muslim chinese food.  at first you're like...what?  then you realize...oh yeah china's huge.  this food comes from western china that shares its borders with many countries that are primarily islamic.  lamb skewer and big plate chicken (with that crazy noodle) are definitely must haves.<//Review>

<text>Great place for different kind of Chinese food from UYGHUR muslim family with all halal meat (slaughtered muslim way). They make their own noodles, fresh. Don't expect fried rice or orange/kung pao kind of  Chinese dishes. They mostly serve lamb and chicken dishes. Meat pie(ground lamb) is a must try., Cumin lamb in skewers is awesome.. Big plate chicken is my favorite. I also tried the Spicy lamb feet (just a little too greasy for me) but minus the grease...it tasted great. It's family restaurant. I advive to go for lunch or early dinner as they run of "menu items" most of the time towards the end of the day. I take as positive. This means my food is fresh, not prepped days ago. Main dishes run between $15-$24.  Service is ok-- little kid helps mom after school. It is a 5/6 tables small CASH ONLY restaurant. One of my favorite eateries.<//text>< pics>

Delicious specialized XinJiang Mom and pop shop. Western Northern China style, lamb galore. Kinda like Mongolian type of food. Not really any veggie dishes.

Specialized means it'll be appreciated by folks that love lamb, and xinjiang food.

Boiled lamb, xinjiang style $16.99 is a must for lamb lovers that love simple dishes. Young lamb meat.

Meat pie $13.99 super crispy is probably a general public must get.

Lag Man (hand-pulled noodles) $13.99.   Oily but the taste mixes well.

Pricey for 3 ppl but worth it if you're looking for their specific dishes, or yummy lamb dishes.< /text>

<UserId.>105373966714694704616</UserId.><Text>Disclaimer to this review: we arrived  2 hours before closing so they were unable to prepare their 2 special dishes, the pilaf and the big plate chicken+noodles.  Instead we tried the kebabs,  hand pulled noodles, and naan.  All the dishes were way more expensive than what the serving size would suggest, with the naan being the most ridiculous (7 dollars for what essentially is a hard bagel). Kebabs were dry and the pulled noodles were nothing to write home about. In addition, extra noodles cost 5 dollars which really peeved my friend from Xinjiang...in her province, extra noodles are free but I understand that isn't possible in america, but still, 5 dollars for extra noodles is a little steep. However, I believe that Omar is the only Xinjiang style restaurant in southern California, so it's better than nothing.</Text><rating>3< /rating>< Time>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The service attitude is very poor, as if I don't pay for meals. I heard that the big plate chicken was good, but I was disappointed in the end. The smell is like a smell of nail sweat, which makes you uncomfortable and has no appetite. The price is relatively high compared to other stores. I think this store just wants to do a one-off business!

(Original)
服务态度极差，好像我吃饭不给钱似的。听说大盘鸡不错才去的，最后大失所望。味道就像有一股甲汗臭的感觉，闻着就不舒服，全无胃口。价格相对其他店还偏高。我看这家店也就是只想做一次性生意！< /Review>

<date>1548401333673<//date><rate>4< /rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Been twice, the price is a little expensive, but fortunately, it is worth the money! Because it is more suitable for the foodies who like to taste the snacks, please ignore the American style of service.

(Original)
去过两次，价格稍微有点儿贵，但还好，算是物有所值吧！因为这里比较适合喜欢品尝风味小吃的吃货们，所以请适当忽略美式不断问水的服务模式。<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) We ordered milk tea, chicken plate with noodle and lamb kebabs. Milk tea was a bit salty to me. Chicken plate was good. Noodle was on the soft side for me. I prefer thicker noodles. Lamb was good. . The big chicken tastes great and I think of the halal canteen in the university. The noodles are a bit soft, and I personally like the face of the power. The kebabs taste great.

<Text>(Translated by Google) It ’s just not good enough. Few people in the store waited for dishes for more than half an hour. Then I ordered a large plate of chicken without any salt. The salt bottle on the table was empty. The large plate of chicken had a large plate. A few muscles. Conscience evaluation! ! !

(Original)
简直牛的不行，店里一共没几个人等菜等了半个多小时，然后点了大盘鸡，一点盐都没放，桌子上的盐瓶子是空的，大盘鸡，就盘子大，一共有几块肌肉。良心评价！！！</Text>< name>

<review>My favorite item was the flavorful Gingerbread cake, filled with wonderful spices!
The "All in One Cake" was an interesting idea. I'm just not sure it really worked.
Overall, everything was well executed!
I still have not replaced my favorite bakery with this one, but it was nice to have a sampling of what they offer since this was my first visit, and I have been wanting to try them ; )<//review>< user_id>

ago. I simply couldn't resist chef Belinda Leong's elevated takes on viennoiserie and pastries, particularly the kouign amanns which were out of this world.

I hadn't visited for quite some time, so when I saw that Belinda had come up with special offerings just for Chinese New Year, I knew I had to try them before they were gone. The items I tried, whether the matcha tiramisu, the black sesame kouign amann, or the tiger sugar tapioca pudding, were very much in line with B Patisserie's regular, everyday offerings, only with Asian flavors that, in general, tend to be more subtle and less overpoweringly sweet than traditional Western sweets and pastries.

The matcha tiramisu, for example, had just enough green tea flavor in it, but not so much as to feel artificial or overwhelming. Same went for the tiger sugar tapioca pudding and even the black sesame kouign amann, although in the latter case it felt quite a bit smaller than the kouign amanns I'd enjoyed when B Patisserie first opened.

In any case, this is still world-class stuff, as Belinda's James Beard award attests. Despite her celebrity and success (a budding empire evidenced not only by B Patisserie's expanded store footprint but also by new ventures like B on the Go and Routier), you can still paparazzi her while she's hard at work in the open prep area, just behind the display cases. Keep up the great work, especially in representing the Bay Area's food scene on a national and even global scale, Belinda!</review><response>None< /response>< userid>

I loved the banana almond chocolate croissant and passionfruit bostock! The cinnamon roll was a bit too crunchy/hard for my liking but had a hint of orange flavoring that I liked, it helped cut the sweetness.

When I come back, I will definitely want to try out some of their cake and mousse items!<//review>

<text>Had the butter croissant and the chocolate mousse cake. The croissant was just a little bit above average. It wasn't flaky or crunchy in the way that the best croissants are. It tasted perhaps a little bit better than the ones you can get at Costco. The chocolate mousse cake had a good flavor and wasn't too sweet however, it didn't taste particularly special in any way. I wouldn't go back to this patisserie. It's expensive for what you get.< /text>< pics>

One of the best Kouign Amann I have ever eaten. You can tell they used real chocolate. The pastry is rich and flaky. Banana chocolate croissant was pretty good as well. Definitely recommend this place to try out.</review>

< review>
This bakery makes delicious pastries. One pastry I tasted a couple of months ago I loved. They only make this on weekends. However I've gone back three times since and this pastry is always sold out. Today I was at the bakery at 11:30 a.m. and they were out again. I complained to the owner and a worker behind the counter and wondered why if they are consistently selling out of this item they don't make more.  All I got was a shrug from the owner and the worker pointed me out to another co-worker and began talking about me.

I like their pastries but I have no intention of going back. They are not hurting for business so I guess one customer's complaint means nothing to them.</review>

I kind of have a sweet tooth.
So whenever I hear of desserts, it’s like I’m super excited.
I really liked the way their pastries looked, I also got some cookies from there, loved the cookies.
I’m giving it 3 stars because the pastries did not meet my expectations.
I have had better, but it might be that I dint make the right selection while buying it.
Im gonna go there again and try something else just coz I loved their cookies.</Text>< Name>

Hard to beat the pastries from this place, not or mention the chocolate chip cookies that are simply to die for. Decent coffee too, just be ready to wait in line...it's a popular place.<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I loved the banana chocolate almond croissant!! This is such a genius combo. I highly recommend it to people who love croissants, banana and chocolate. This is one of the best croissant I had so far. The croissant itself is probably in between Tartine and Arsicault - not as doughy as the former or as buttery as the latter, but very balanced and delicate.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCwDKKkR26-k-u42nXL1cVqyhALWKgPy9HTs2u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnxBHLIlnyuDLYzitt05sPP4T_1rtmEDEY70la=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

This is our goto on the weekends! Best in San Francisco and the Bay Area! Everything here is delicious, our favorites: classic Kouign Amann, Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant and the apple tart. It's always so fresh! Staff is very friendly! Oh and one of our very favorites their sandwiches, they're more like pizzas (like open toasts with all melted cheese on top), just amazing!</Text>

Best pastries in San Francisco, hands down.  The banana almond chocolate croissant is amazing!!  This place blows Tartine out of the water, the quality and customer service is so much better than the grimy hipster riddled mission spot.  Anybody who has lived in SF for any period of time knows this is the best spot.</text>

<Text>This just has to be the best place to buy pastries!!!!! I'm going to say that I believe this to be true because I don't like pastries but I love this place!!! The last time I went there I spent over $150 on pastry so I could share them with my family and friends. 😋😋😋😋 I don't eat ham and cheese but they make the best ham and cheese croissant that I've ever eaten. 💖😋💖😋 I left my heart in San Francisco at B. Patisserie 💖<//Text>< rate>

My wife went in while I waited in the car with the kids, so I can't say much for the in-store experience.  She said it was extraordinarily busy and that everything was rushed, creating a stressful environment.  That said, the three things she brought were delicious. A passion fruit kouign amann and a chocolate kouign amann, and a ham and cheese croissant sort of thing. Highly recommended.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI9R5CtH8-mZ8tNpzIGfwjfjreMB7RtUePgI25=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBcqq_J8B8NKHsxf6v6rkKN9Y6vinPtoV9e_rs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOHeaRsoDKmWNLxqmaUcslYwYashjZnRae6uSk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

bon ap·pé·tit, authentic french patisserie 😋 Glad to visit this spot. Sometime is difficult to find parking spot, but you will figure it out for such delicacy. Pastries were smooth, delicious and flavorful. Almond cake must try, fluffy and moist. Almond Croissant , plain or stuffed coconut croissant try anything you love. But do try croissants. If you’re in SFO and want to have authentic french patisserie you must visit this location.</review>

Luckily we ordered in advance it feels fairly safe. There are segregated lines for walk in and pickup.
Prepaid online so I don’t know how payment works on the spot. staff wear masks.

Little one at home loves their granola.

Kouign-aman are dangerously delicious. Its super flakey and a tad in the sweet sight probably one of these pastries you don’t wanna eat on daily nor weekly basis.

*The Kouign-aman photos are from their pop up store.< /Review>

We had to wait for about 15 minutes on a Sunday morning, but definitely worth it! However, if you know what you want, there is an expedited order online and pick-up option. Chocolate kouign aman was very flaky with drippy chocolate, so not the right choice if you're wearing something fancy or trying to eat in a dignified manner, but it was so tasty!!! Chocolate croissant had an almost coffecake-like topping--not the traditional pain au chocolate, but definitely a pleasure. Coffee service was quick and drinks were delicious; I appreciated that there are oat milk lattes. Staff did a fantastic job managing flow safely to ensure social distancing, and they were also very friendly.</text>

<review>I didn't try the coffee, but the pastries are absolutely divine. The croissants are flaky and buttery and delicious. MUST TRY the banana chocolate croissant, it is by far the best pastry there, indulgent. The passionfruit is a close second, sweet and tart. The kouign-amanns are slightly too buttery/greasy but they taste heavenly nonetheless. Don't get them if you're on a health grind.</review>< Pics>

My husband and I went here during our vacation and totally loved it! The bakery is welcoming and although Covid has changed things and you generally have to wait outside for your turn, the line went quickly and each employee was kind, welcoming and helpful. I was very impressed by each employee and the efficient and calm matter that they seemed to work in.
For our first time we got the Kouign Amann, the ginger molasses cookie and a hazelnut chocolate cake. The hazelnut chocolate cake left a little to be desired for me, the balance of flavors felt off but not a bad cake, just didn't stand out. On the other hand, my husband LOVED the Kouign Amann, it was wonderfully flakey and fresh, I was able to snatch a bite or two and agree that it was amazing. The ginger molasses cookie was my favorite and frankly, perfectly done, in my opinion. It was soft and chewy in the center, lightly crispy on the outside, had a beautiful light crunch from the sugar crystals and a fantastic balance of ginger and sweetness. I love ginger cookies but rarely are they done as well as the ones I got at b. Patisserie. We went back the very next day, ordered the Kouign Amann and Ginger cookie again and both were just as well done as the day before. I also ordered an almond banana chocolate crossiant for my mom which I gave her two days later when we went to visit, I had a bite myself and it tasted delicious! I can only imagine how good it must have tasted fresh! Lovely bakery, 5 stars without question, we hope to come again in the future.</Review>

Came for the kouign-amann...got the chocolate version (ahh! Such rich chocolate, all melty, super flaky) plus the chocolate almond banana croissant (perfect combo and each bite had variety of flavors and textures) and a chocolate chip cookie (large, buttery, layers of chocolate) coffee was bold.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>If you want to taste some of the best desserts and vienoisserie the Bay Area has to offer.

With your "squad" for a foodie photoshoot for the  'gram...this isn't the kind of venue for all that nonsense. People here like to eat, not play with their food. If you MUST, get your order to go, then do your business OUTSIDE. There's better lighting anyway LOL!!!

B Patisserie is the best of the best in the Bay Area and always a must when I return to my other home away from home (Napa Valley)
On our most recent visit, we had our usual favorites- Chocolate and Classic Kougin Amann,  Passionfruit Bostock, and  Chocolate Chip Cookie. Another must is Chef Belinda Leong's desserts. This time,  we had the Chocolate Cream Cheese Budino, Black Sesame,  and Pumpkin Cheesecake. Always delicious, always consistent.

Another great thing to see is Chef Leong actually working alongside her pastry cooks, which was the case in every one of our visits in the past. VERY respectable,  considering you  rarely see the actual owner hustling with their staff on a  daily basis nowadays. You know what they say..."Teamwork makes the dream work!" She most definitely has a solid team behind her, and it shows.

It's always just been coffee and sweets for us, until we saw the table next to us enjoying the Ham and Cheese Tartine, so of course,  we had to try it(and it was BOMB!!!)and now it has become part of our hit list on every future visit to our favorite Patisserie in San Francisco.  ALOHA!!!

<text>Love this bakery! Everything here both looks and tastes delicious. The Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant and Kouign Amann here are seriously to die for. And there is also many more options which could be your favorite.

The line in here gets big sometimes. If your in hurry just make an online order there is some links to so and your order will be ready at the time you arrive there.</text>< pictures>

best desserts and vienoisserie the Bay Area has to offer.

With your "squad" for a foodie photoshoot for the  'gram...this isn't the kind of venue for all that nonsense. People here like to eat, not play with their food. If you MUST, get your order to go, then do your business OUTSIDE. There's better lighting anyway LOL!!!

B Patisserie is the best of the best in the Bay Area and always a must when I return to my other home away from home (Napa Valley)
On our most recent visit, we had our usual favorites- Chocolate and Classic Kougin Amann,  Passionfruit Bostock, and  Chocolate Chip Cookie. Another must is Chef Belinda Leong's desserts. This time,  we had the Chocolate Cream Cheese Budino, Black Sesame,  and Pumpkin Cheesecake. Always delicious, always consistent.

Another great thing to see is Chef Leong actually working alongside her pastry cooks, which was the case in every one of our visits in the past. VERY respectable,  considering you  rarely see the actual owner hustling with their staff on a  daily basis nowadays. You know what they say..."Teamwork makes the dream work!" She most definitely has a solid team behind her, and it shows.

It's always just been coffee and sweets for us, until we saw the table next to us enjoying the Ham and Cheese Tartine, so of course,  we had to try it(and it was BOMB!!!)and now it has become part of our hit list on every future visit to our favorite Patisserie in San Francisco.  ALOHA!!!

<Review>Fabulous pastries and delicious tartines. I’ve eaten lunch here several times and have never been disappointed. The mushroom tartine is incredible. The desserts are exquisite. Expensive and worth it.
Nice atmosphere, outdoor seating available. There’s always a line but it goes pretty quickly. The marble top tables with cast iron bases lend a nice vintage Parisian flair to the otherwise modern space.< /Review>< Pics>

Absolutely the best bakery in the city, can't beat this 2018 James Beard award winner!  So many varieties of goods, everything is immaculately delicious.  Cakes are refined and complex in technique, exquisite taste. Croissants are buttery, flaky and slightly crunchy on the outside. Everything is wonderful here; the line moves quickly because they are well staffed.<//text>

This place is crazy busy prior to the pandemic with lots of options for pastries and cakes.  Since the shelter in place, they have reduced their menu as it is take away only.  Even with the small selection, the pastries are still very satisfying.  I do suggest getting a cookie for later.  Service here is friendly and they have some options for  "takeaways" which a small packages of treats.  My favorite of these are the Kouign Amann Ends.<//review>

You can't go wrong with the kouign amann. This is the place to go in SF for that pastry. They will have one of the original and then one unique flavor, so you can always try new flavors whenever you come. I haven't tried the other pastries. The line also moves fast so they've got their operations down pat. Make sure you get one for the road ;)<//Review>

It is delicious.

B Patisserie does hold to the hype. The pastries I have tried were beautiful, delicious and well baked. I do wish they have more items to choose from.

The price of the bakes are moderate to high. Then again it just like everything else around San Francisco. It is definitely worth checking out, but once I have tried all of what's on the menu, I could be over it.

Definitely looking to try the other pastries, so for now I will give it a 5 star rating.< /Text>< rating>

<Review>My favorite stop for pastries in San Francisco. It is so hard to choose which treat to purchase as they are all delicious, but my favorite are the scones and the kouign-amanns. They also have baguettes and levain loaves. On weekends there tends to be a wait but the line moves fast & during Covid you can pre-order as well.</Review>< Date>

The Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant and Kouign Amann here are seriously to die for. The desserts are good too, but oh the pastries are heavenly. I always make sure to stop here when I'm in SF. The line to get in looks long but don't be intimidated as it moves fairly quick!< /text>

< review>
What a treat!  We swung by this bakery on our way to the Presidio, and boy did we luck out.  The line stretched out the door (around 11:15am) but moved quickly, and staff was simultaneously patient and helpful with recommendations.  We ended up getting a lunch sandwich each - I the mushroom and she the ham and cheese- I thought mine had a slight edge though the accompanying side salads were just as tasty.  We of course also got two Kouign-amanns, one regular and one chocolate, and a chocolate chip cookie that was warm and chewy.</review>

<Review>WOW! I walked 1.2 miles to get here, up and down San Francisco hills, in the already hot morning on a rare San Francisco day that would later reach 104°. I was sweatin' up a storm and almost missed class just to get this Kouign-Amman but oh my was it worth it! It was flakier than that one high school friend who bailed last minute every single time you made plans, the chocolate at the center was rich and soft, and the cinnamon-sugar flavor between each layer was perfectly balanced.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE1FHz7daOILqlATfF3SwSdi-YOQmk3embMGVP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4hfa26b8E9FswasczhY5SEozcuXyVkpjw4NQi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOIAl-cezEXIKCE0rdR7Ngia6tJU2R0AQ2LfCe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Something happened during covid @ this fantastic bakery.   The wonderful croissants filled with bananas/chocolate/blueberry etc are sorely lacking in that same filling.  Please bring back the old recipes and not cut corners.<//review>

Although there are many bakeries in San Francisco, few capture the quintessential experience of France that b patisserie achieves.
Here Belinda Leong, pastry chef extraordinaire and co-owner, works her magic. Laminated pastry dough is her medium.

The item she is most famous for is the kouign amann. The classic Breton pastry has layers of flaky pastry and caramelized sugar rolled into the shape of a Breton cap.
Leong makes the classic and an abundance of other flavors such as chocolate (to die for) and exotic flavors such as black sesame and passionfruit (my favorite).
Of course, other pastries shine here as well. There’s the banana chocolate croissant, the almond croissant, a stellar chocolate shard cookie. The baguette and the levain bread are both outstanding.

For ambiance, the cafe is chic reminiscent of Paris, mirrors on white walls through which you can admire the reflection of the baked goods or other patrons.

There is light fare for lunch. Sandwiches or salad. If you care for more on a slightly heavier scale, cross the street to B on the Go, her other casual dining cafe.

Outside the cafe is a parklet if you’d prefer to eat outdoors to take advantage of fine weather or sun.

When you come to b patisserie, imagine yourself in France enjoying fine food and decor. Relax. There is no more French-style cafe here in the City. Bon Appetit!< /Text>

Came to b. Patisserie looking for a great French croissant in San Francisco.  While their croissant is not great, it is also not the worst ever. The is color, layering and finish. Bit all are a bit lacking except the color. For example, layering though extant, was a little poor and resulted in the product leaning towards a bread crescent rolls than a nice croissant. The crust, though browned, was soft instead of crisp. At $3.25 the value for the b. Patisserie croissant is middle low. I'd settle for in a pinch after drunken night out, but would head to one of my other places to get a French croissant made with artistry.

As for a direct comparison to actual French croissants experienced multiple times since 1992, b. Patisserie needs some work and some refresher training in a art of a perfect croissant.

Paired my croissant with a cappucino.  Decent cappucino but next time I am going to ask for more potency, and more heat.

The location is excellent and cut. A great place to relax for breakfast or lunch.  Large and clean windows to watch the world go by. Comfortable chairs and benches both inside, and café style on the sidewalk to take in the sun.

Even though b. Patisserie is not my ideal croissant place I look forward to a return to enjoy some tarts and sandwiches sometime in the future.</Text>

The lines can get long but it moves quickly and if you want to eat for here just send one person to find a table while you wait.< /Review>< pictures>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Awesome pastries.  Our favorites are too many to list.  Go to favorite if we want something heavy and satisfying is the chocolate banana almond croissant.  But for light fare we really like the kouign amann Regular, the chocolate, and then the other variants that seem to come and go (raspberry, black sesame, pumpkin (must be seasonal) ... These flavors are more subtle ).  There seems to always be a line but never too long to wait.  Pretty good about covid-19 safety protocols.<//text><Time>1605839131946< /Time></record></dataset><record>

High quality products, with a big selection. Not much savory for breakfast but if you like the classical sweet French you're in the right place. I opted for a blueberry and coconut scone, it was surprisingly light and soft. Also tried their signature appel/cinnamon croissant, its delicious but very sweet. Coffee keeps with the high standard. Would really recommend a visit. (No wifi).<//text>

Enjoyed the passionfruit bostock and ham and cheese croissant but sadly the rest of our pastries were mediocre at best (and those are the ones we came here for). The kouign amann tasted like “diet kouign amann” there wasn’t enough butter in the pastry and the outside was barely caramelized. The apricot (or apricot mango?) almond croissant was also lacking that punch - the top wasn’t baked enough and barely had any almonds. The inside tasted like it was just apricot preserve, there was no almond filling.< /Text>

Absolutely in love with this place! Must go when in town! I respect how they’re also dedicating a big portion of their revenue to the wildfire relief ❤️</Review>

Very popular bakery in San Francisco. If you are having a hard time deciding between kouign amann and croissant, kouign amann wins hands down!! Buttery, flaky and sinful, how a good pastry should be. :) Pictured are the seasonal black sesame kouign amann (yumm!!) and almond chocolate banana croissant.</Review>

The best Viennoiserie in San Francisco! The cafe is clean and modern and well staffed. The lines moved quickly and the were still many varieties available. The croissants are seasonally flavored (the chocolate banana so good), the kouign amann are the crown jewel (so flaky and light), the bostock are so soft yet creamy with almond paste.
Street parking, credit accepted, pleasant professional staff.<//review>

The Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant and Kouign Amann here are seriously to die for. The desserts are good too, but oh the pastries are heavenly. I always make sure to stop here when I'm in SF. The line to get in looks long but don't be intimidated as it moves fairly quick!</text>

Excellent pastries at a well decorated deli style bakery. We tried a number of things based on what looked goo and everything was a hit! I think the chocolate banana croissant would be my favorite.</Text>

Best pastries I've ever eaten! Flaky, buttery, beautiful and yummy! We came at what I thought would be a busy time late a.m. on Sunday, but we ordered within a couple minutes and were taking ours to go. Coffee takes a bit longer if getting a specialty drink but pastry service is very fast. Try the banana chocolate croissant!< /Text>

It's already a known secret. Line forms when you can smell the butter and sugar melding together on the flaky croissant dough that forms their magical kouign amann. Seasonal flavors enhance the experience but nothing beats the original. Always a must have when we visit.< /Text>

Lovely fancy desserts, beautiful rustic pastries. The Kouign-amanns were perfect. The chocolate banana almond croissant, while buttery and gooey, was fantastic. The cafe was busy at 11 am on a Tuesday, but the staff helped customers quickly and we did catch a table inside.</text>

<Text>I'm normally not huge on pastries, but the kouigan amann was transcendental. The perfect combination of textures - it was somehow flaky, doughy, crispy, and moist all at the same time. I tried their seasonal pumpkin flavor, and I'm glad I did, although I imagine that any of the flavors would be as good. You need this in your life, trust me.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLhLzPRTD4GhlI-xE6CwuCRIJbECYnIt1pWok=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

If you are planning to visit the place on weekends, prepare to wait in a line. The employees are pretty quick, so wait time is not long.<//review>< user_name>

Awesome pastries and baked goods. They also have a few sandwiches if you want to make it a more rounded meal.< /text>

Excellent pastries at a well decorated deli style bakery. We tried a number of things based on what looked goo and everything was a hit! I think the chocolate banana croissant would be my favorite.</Text>

<Text>Great atmosphere. For small groups or singleton. Delicious almod cake and their coffee is on point.

Only wish they had a sign at the front to order pastries prior to standing in line.

The add-ins (creamer, sugar, etc) is tucked in the corner and out of the way across the register.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXmEeeVC1N3KnnOGb7miBlIjfbxvLmho-IL-DN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808580c961a0d5e7:0xea755410f0b98bb< /Gmap_id></record>

Delightful pastries and a lovely crew. They had just sold the last chocolate kouign amann and I was getting sad inside. I asked if they had anymore and they said “No, but I can make one for you.” I was delighted! It paired very well with a chai latte. 🤗< /Review>

A solid well deserved 5 stars for this French patisserie in SF. Yelp recommended to try the Kouign-Amman, and it didn't disappoint, with layers of delicate puff pastry with a dab of chocolate in the middle. I got a banana croissant to go while walking out, in hindsight should have gotten a plain croissant, I think you shouldn't mess with the originals!! But overall a great spot for french pastries and baked goods. I'll be back for sure.< /review>

This is my favorite pastry store. However,  the quality was not as stable as before. I hope they can keep the quality at the same level. I drive at least 40 mins one way to buy the pastry. I got disappointed for couple of times.
I was a fan Gary Danko's deserts. So when I knew the pastry chef opened a store herself, I knew the pastry will be good. I have tried most of items here. However, I found that only Kouign Amann Nature is my favorite. Other pastries are good but not as good as kouign amann. I don't quite like its cakes. Drinks are ok but pricey. Sandwiches are ok if you happen to be hungry here. You will have to be in line first to pick the items you want and pay then find a place to sit. Most of the time you can find a place to sit very quickly. The store is always packed.< /text>

Our favorite bakery for kouign amann, although their other pastries are also delicious. They also have a nice lil outdoor pet friendly area. The only downside is that same area is right along the streets and dangerously close to incoming traffic.< /text>

I'm usually not a big pastry fan, but this place has me converted. We came here when traveling based off of a recommendation.

We tried the plum mixed berry kouigan-amann and the mixed berry almond croissant. They were both amazing and the best pastries I've ever had. The kouigan-amann was my favorite. I've never had anything like it! It was sweet, buttery, and delicious.

Service was fast—we just picked out our pastries and paid at the counter.

This is a must try in San Francisco!< /review>

I am not one for pastries, however, I’ve honestly never tasted something so good as their kouign amann. It was delicate, perfectly sweet and flakey.

The staff was very helpful both times we visited while vacationing, providing many suggestions but all I cared about was the kouign.<//Text>

<Text>Great pastries with a very nice assortment. The      Staff were very helpful, patiently pointing out their top items.  I of course obliged with a large box and tried most of them. Preferred these to another popular bakery in Mission. Parking also is a bit easier with meters and 2 hour spots not too far away.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Kouign-amann ($4.25)
I visited on Christmas eve and it was really crowded  with people trying to buy christmas cakes. When I got there, Kouign-amann was sold out and the staff said it would take about 15 minutes to get one. I waited and got freshly baked one. In short, it was so great. Perfectly crunchy outside with soft inside with pleasant butter smell. Well balanced between saltiness and sweetness. Definitely worth waiting. Also, staffs there were helpful.< /Text>

I was worried that the quality could have slipped since my last visit few years ago - but instead I was blown away by yummy, perfectly flaky, balanced sweet goodness all around! Amazing place! (Also, the seasonal apple filled twice baked croissant should be an all year thing - it’s that good!)<//Review>

<rate>2< /rate><review>Pretty desserts, and it would have been a nice visit, and then the cashier had to leave a real bad taste in my mouth.  She tried to start helping the next person, without giving me a moment to pick up my things and leave.  I was inclined to fetch out the tip I had just left in the jar.  Maybe I should have not taken that moment to tip?  I am never going back.  I can go elsewhere and be treated nicely.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

The baked goods here are very, very good, and there's always a wide variety of sweet pastries. Plus they're well organized to get everyone through the line and checked out efficiently. The only downside is it's very busy and usually hard to find a seat- we typically get everything to go and eat at the park a couple blocks away.<//Text>

Yes, there are plenty of other bakeries in San Francisco, but none of them makes a better kouign amann than b.patisserie! A bit on the pricier side, but my-oh-my are their pastries worth the splurge (and more)! You have to taste it and experience the unbeliveable bliss of b. These pastries will blow your taste buds away and you will not settle for anything less than their quality. Absolutely love their chocolate banana croissant and kouign amann; they make them in classic flavors as well as seasonal flavors.

<Name>Alex Hom</Name><Review>B pats is a must try patisserie in the beautiful city of SF. In fact, once you've tried B you'll want to add it to your list of pitstops whenever you're in the mood for some sweet treats because it never disappoints! I love that the place is open concept so you can watch the pastry chefs /bakers/ artists at work. You can visit for the pastries of course, but if you're stomach is craving more than just sweets I've seen people go in for sandwiches and coffee too! However, if you're like me and you love buttery, flakey, crispy pastries, their kouign•amann is to die for! Whether it's the plain, chocolate, or seasonal flavored one, it always puts a smile on my face.. I'm drooling just thinking about it. The cookies are that perfect crispy-chewy scrumptious many of us seek, and their cakes, tarts, mousses, and other sweet treasures are decadent to the point that just closing your eyes and taking that first bite will whisk you off to paradise. In short, this place is dangerously good, so stop by if you can resist the temptations of purchasing one of everything. Good luck, future visitors!<//Review></record>

< review>
One of the most famous bakeries in the city, and I personally like it better than Tartine.
Known for kouign amann, which is the French, round shaped, caramelized croissant. Loaded with butter and caramelized sugar, but indeed worthy of the sin even for the most health conscious people.
The store is busy but well organized. You pick up your items while waiting in line, then proceed to the check out. There is free, self served water, along with first come first serve small tables. For the times I've come, I can always sit down and enjoy my kouign amann in 5 minutes or so. That's also much better than the 20-30 min wait at Tartine.
Btw the menu is outdated. Most items are 25 to 50 cents more expensive, as of August 2017. Original kouign amann is $4.25 now.</review>

Great bakery. There was a line before it opened so I knew it was good. I personally loved the ginger cake. It was delicious.<//text>

I am not one for pastries, however, I’ve honestly never tasted something so good as their kouign amann. It was delicate, perfectly sweet and flakey.

The staff was very helpful both times we visited while vacationing, providing many suggestions but all I cared about was the kouign.<//text>

One of the most famous bakeries in the city, and I personally like it better than Tartine.
Known for kouign amann, which is the French, round shaped, caramelized croissant. Loaded with butter and caramelized sugar, but indeed worthy of the sin even for the most health conscious people.
The store is busy but well organized. You pick up your items while waiting in line, then proceed to the check out. There is free, self served water, along with first come first serve small tables. For the times I've come, I can always sit down and enjoy my kouign amann in 5 minutes or so. That's also much better than the 20-30 min wait at Tartine.
Btw the menu is outdated. Most items are 25 to 50 cents more expensive, as of August 2017. Original kouign amann is $4.25 now.< /Text>

I mean... How can you not LOVE b? This is probably my favorite patisserie in SF hands down. The pastries are wonderfully laminated, the combinations are varied, inventive, and fresh, and the flavors are well balanced. Throw in a great coffee and I just can't imagine having a better Saturday morning. You just gotta go early because it can get crazy pretty quickly. Usually if you're there before nine, you'll be fine. But that can change on a dime.<//text>

< Review>
I really wanted this place to be good. I was looked at it online and thought okay this looks like a really carefully thought out and well put together place. Maybe I'll even get to meet the pastry chef as the article I read suggested she was passionate about her business, so why wouldn't she be? When I got their the environment was chaotic as there was a long of people and may workers scrambling and they asked for a tip on the little computer thing used for transactions. What service did they have that required a tip? Was it their bagging skills or how they grabbed a bag? Or was it how they handed me the number. And all the other people clearly seem to like it and maybe I got their too late in the morning but for the cost! I mean, the pastries were room temperature although baked well and to me that's really unsatisfying.<//Review>

<Review>Wow.  Killer bakery and amazing pastries.  Everything I tried (and I tried a lot!) was just about as perfect as you can get.  I went back for more and took some home to share.   Croissants were amazing as were all the pastries.  Nothing disappointed.  I'd highly recommend, and would go out of the way to visit, and enjoy what this shop produces. Yum.< /Review><Date>1555387603064< /Date><gmapID>0x808580c961a0d5e7:0xea755410f0b98bb< /gmapID>< Resp>

Great pastries with a very nice assortment. The      Staff were very helpful, patiently pointing out their top items.  I of course obliged with a large box and tried most of them. Preferred these to another popular bakery in Mission. Parking also is a bit easier with meters and 2 hour spots not too far away.<//Text>

Loved their chocolate banana almond croissant so much the first time I had it that I decided to come back during my 4 day trip even though it was out of the way. Sadly the second time round the texture was hard in some areas, even the one I took away. So I guess try to catch them on a good day coz they do have bad days as well. Also, the first time I went I asked for hot water and I got it but the second time, the guy tried to charge me for it. It was weird.
On the up side, they had a really gd chocolate pecan cake.< /review>

very nice pastries, open during covid pandemic. they only allow 2 parties into the store at once and have X's marked on the ground for social distancing. hand sanitizer available.

the kouign amann and the chocolate chip cookie were very tasty. a little expensive in my opinion, but the quality is very good!</text>

My favorite bakery in the city... And no I'm not biased cuz I use to live around the corner.

While they're known for their kouign amanns and they're amazing, I have a soft spot for their banana chocolate croissants. Those are so amazing.

Be prepared. This place is always busy so good luck finding a spot to sit. They have a small seating area outside for those with pets but those spots are hard to snag in peak times as well.<//Text>

Well. I'm going to have to thank my coworker Carolyn for referring me to this heaven. I've never had anything as delicious as that cream cheese and caramel cake. It was so delicious, in fact, we just ordered one for our baby shower next week. Whew. I will be back, for sure.< /Text>

They had them and all the other tasty treats I sampled on Oahu. The ambience in the SF shop is great for grabbing coffee and eating pastries alone or with friends. I will be back!<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Kougin amann's in at least two flavors are excellent, capable of contending with the best anywhere (at least in the USA), the chocolate croissant is flaky and delicious with the right amount of chocolate... ordered a few more things and was satisfied by them all.

That said, some luck in beating the line is involved-- or it does get a little ugly when you can smell the delicious baked goods but can't get any just yet!</Text>

I love their gourmet pastries and the open decor to this place!

The presentation when walking in, is pristine and filled with warmth.  When stepping in, one can smell the fresh, baked goodness of this pastry shop.

It's a pleasant aroma and ambiance.  Make it a go-to cafe shop and it's adorned.</Text>

Service staff are very quick to assume that your order is done and leave you to go back to making their display look nice.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Expensive, but cheaper than a flight to Paris.  Even if you're in Paris, you will not find many shops that can rival B. Patisserie's croissants--it is that good.  The place is best known for its kouign amann--superb.< /Text>< pics>

Fabulous pastries as always. If its youre first time definitely get one of the kouign amans, but you really cant go wrong with anything here. Their pastries are just all so buttery and flaky. Everything you could want in a pastry, they got it. Creme fillings, chocolate fillings, pumpkin spice(seasonal?) lilikoi, whatever. they're all good</Text>

Pastries are good but overall quality has gone down. And customer service is essentially non-existent.</Review>

Oh my goodness. Don't waste another bite on a tasteless cookie or sweet from somewhere else - save your sweet tooth for B.Patisserie. Macaroons, tarts, scones, French-goodness I can't even pronounce - what a treat for the neighborhood! Lovely marble counters, so hip & so so perfectly done. Artists will rejoice at the delicate sweets & presentation. Bravo B. Patisserie & Welcome to the neighborhood!< /review>

Amazing pastries and baked goods with great service. There's usually a small line, especially on weekends, but it's because the place is so good. Their mocha is one of the best I've had.</Text>

We were walking to the “Full House” house when a person we happen to be walking past chatted us up.  She suggested this pastry place and spoke highly of it.  We thought if a person that has lived in the city for 20 years suggests it you should go.  We were not disappointed.  We ordered the amann something it was the best pastry I and my wife have ever ordered.  If you visit San Francisco you have to make this place a stop.   Thank you to the lady that chatted us up!<//Text>

I normally think it’s a five star experience, but I noticed that the success is catching up to them. The quality is slipping just a little...  also, the service was slightly worse than the last time I was there. They can barely keep up with cleaning the tables between customers. It’s always been busy, but it felt like the crowds were finally overwhelming B.  I hope they get their groove back.<//Text>

Pastries: amazing. Sandwiches: really bad. Coffee: super strong, dark French roast. Prices: about $ 4.00 - $ 7.00 for a pastry. $11.00 for a sandwich. Turkey club is made with processed turkey roll (aka "cold cuts.") Ham and cheese is grilled with two cheeses so salty, it's almost inedible. But those pastries are magic! And if you haven't visited in a while, be advised they've doubled the size of the place in the past year, so seating is no longer a problem. Still have a fairly insane cash register setup.< /review>

While popular because of their Kouign Amann, I find their quiche to be sublime. They also have tartines available. Come for the varied selection, ample seating, and efficient service but return because of the exceptional products.</Text>

I'm French so I know a bunch about patisserie. Well I can say that B Patisserie is a fine place. What they are doing there is fantastic, from the basic croissant to the elaborated cakes, everything I've tried so far was fantastic.

Prices are high but I'd say reasonable for the quality, keep them as they are!

We love to go there with friend to have coffee on the very French looking take and enjoy some sweets. Unfortunately it became hard to find a spot as the place is getting more and more popular, classic story.

If you are into pastries, that's, in my humble opinion, the best place in the city<//Text>

The sweets are better than the savories. Skip the cheese scone. Didn't have it but the egg salad looks delish. Will try it next time. The apple tart is most excellent.< /review>

This place has incredible pastries to the point where I'm not sure how they do it! We ordered the banana chocolate croissant and somehow they managed to keep the croissant fluffy and flakey while injecting it with huge chunks of banana and gobs of chocolate. The chocolate chip cookie was irresistible as well. I can't wait to come back and eat more pastries here, health outcomes be damned!<//Review>

Go. And go now because there is probably a line. I'm not a "wait in line" person but I'll wait all day for these pastries. Just ask for a box and get one of everything haha...but really....it's all so so good.</text>

Fabulous pastries.  The plain croissant is worth the trip all by itself.  We also had a savory croissant and biscuit.  There was a line, but it moved fast.<//review>

I love how they are sweet like a pastry should be (unless it's savory) but not so sweet like a sugar-bomb in your mouth that many pastry places seem to make. Also, their coffee is quite good. However, do not let that one $ fool you, its relative. This is SF and most pastries start at $4 (I'm talking the small ones) and go up to $7-$9. A sandwich will set you back about $11. This is one $ considering the area, though, and it was very delicious!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Amazing baked goods and lively atmosphere. Loved the kouign amann and banana chocolate croissant the most. Scones are also perfect. This place is pretty far from me but worth biking up a bunch of hills for!</Text>

The one and only B. Patisserie. You can’t go wrong if you’re looking for a bakery than here. Expect a line as usual inside and if you’re new here, get the Passion Fruit Bostock and a classic Kouign Amann. You will not regret it. In fact I’m certain you will be coming back for more!< /Text>

< Review>
Arrived around 10am. Standing room only and the line wasn't quite out the door. Timed it perfectly as by the time we left, just a few minutes after arrival, the line was out the door and heading down the block. What to say about this place? Their specialty is Kougin Amman, which I ordered 2 regulars and 1 special with strawberry and rhubarb. The KAs are incredible--my only point of reference is Dominique Ansel's DKA and I think b patisserie's are better (lighter, greater contrast between the sweet and the savory). Also ordered a chocolate croissant for my daughter and a almond apricot peach crossaint. Oh, damn, can't forget the cinnamon roll or the baguette. The croissants were melt-in-your-mouth beautiful and the cinnamon roll is off the chain--I love hint of citrus (orange zest?!?). The shop is organized so you can sit, if there is space, or easily take your lovelies to go. The line parades you in front of the pastries and an employee grabs what you need. The few people I spoke with were very friendly and thankful. This is a good point at which to end this review as I need to go work off the 750+ calories I just consumed.< /Review>

<Review>Everyone goes bananas over the banana chocolate croissants. Unpopular opinion: the kouign amann, though made like most in San Francisco, is not nearly as good as the large flat one which I think is closer to the real, traditional thing. Without a doubt though, b makes the best chocolate chip cookie in the city. Never disappoints, always so delicious.</Review>< pics>

Oh delicate pastries,  delectable cakes, scrumptious baked goodies and little bare hands...
Wait, what?!
As I was ordering few things I caught a staff member using her bare hands to place a little tartlet in a paper bag. Out of wax paper? All tongs got stolen?
Whatever the case might be, I don't know where those hands have been!
So for $7 per tiny cake slice I expect it to be handled properly, without extra freebie cold sore or some other "awesome" gift that keeps on giving...<//Review>

Fancy awesome is the best way to describe this bakery. The prices are def worth it, but a little much for an every day splurge. Seriously though, this is almost a "must eat at" kind of place. Coffee is excellent and pretty much everything we have tried, sweet to savory, has been amazing.  This is not really a stay and work kind of place, but there is plenty of seating both inside and out. No free wifi.</Review>

Learned about this patisserie from an online article. I checked it out a week ago and it lives up to the hype. Everything I purchased was delicious and the presentation of the pastries  were beautifully crafted. This has become one of my favorite places to visit in SF. The next time I'll try their other eatery, B on the Go.< /text>

The food here is to die for -- I think their products embody baked good perfection (similar to Tartine). Why only 4 stars? The line is usually out the door, so you'll likely wait 20-30 minutes to order. This detracts enough from the experience that I don't come here unless I really have a hankering; most of the time, I'll opt for something easier. Still, it is worth coming here once in awhile to remind yourself of what true artistry can achieve.</Text>

<text>A must. The banana chocolate almond croissant is what dreams are made of. The cookies are great and while I did not have any, the artistic pastries are gorgeous! They serve a few options for lunch sandwiches that come with a side salad and are also very good. I had the burrata tomato open face.<//text>< Pics>

Reminiscent of my time living in Paris. Enter the store to be greeted with a smile and warm welcome by staff behind the counter to the lovely pastries and gluten-free almond cake.  Only sadness is macaroons available only on weekends.  Between b.  Patisserie and Thorough bread,  my cravings for French sweet indulgences is easily satisfied</Text>

Kouign Amann is IT!  Similar to croissant, but squarish, more buttery, fabulous fillings.<//review>

Seriously, you have to have it. I have to have it. Because it is amazing. Layers of flakey, buttery, caramelized perfection. And don’t get me started on the sugary syrup flowing from the pastry as you bite in. Pronounced “queen ah-man,” the french pastry literally translates as “butter cake.” B. Patisserie serves the best one I’ve had yet. The smell of the bakery is intoxicating with a great view of the kitchen where Belinda, the namesake and pastry chef, does wonderful, wonderful things.< /Review>

Yes. Amazing. Totally worth the wait. Your stomach will thank you.

We had to wait a little bit to get a table which is totally normal for a place this size, but the awesome thing was they took our cell phone and contacted us when the table was ready! So we were able to run an errand in the time we had to wait. Great food, great service. Word on the street is these guys turned down a food network show because they said they were already busy enough! So cool</text>

Everyone goes bananas over the banana chocolate croissants. Unpopular opinion: the kouign amann, though made like most in San Francisco, is not nearly as good as the large flat one which I think is closer to the real, traditional thing. Without a doubt though, b makes the best chocolate chip cookie in the city. Never disappoints, always so delicious.< /Text>

We come here often, and there is always a line, though it moves pretty fast. Known for their kouign amanns, all their pastries are delicious. We haven't tried their sandwiches, but see those ordered often. And we would invariably go next door for some bubble tea, making a nice east/west afternoon snack experience.<//text>

<text>Probably the best Kouign Amann in SF. Not too pricey and good variety of KA and other pastries. Friendly staff and pleasant ambiance. I love their location cause their conveniently located on California street just outside Pacific heights where you can easily drive here and find parking. I haven't tried their drinks much but from.what I gather their good to. Seating is open with round tables and diner benches so great place to grab a bite with friends and socialize.<//text>< date>

<Review>Really really good bakery. I suggest getting the banana chocolat croissant if you want some yummy rich goodness! Warm is the best! The ham and cheese croissant is also good and served like a croque monsieur (bechamelle sauce), also better warm.

My third visit in two trips to SF, and I will always visit on subsequent trips. Great selection of rich delicious pastries and cakes, but also some excellent savory options too for those without the sweet tooth.

Most recently had the quiche which was truly fantastic. We also had a variety of sweets to share including passion fruit kouign-amann, raspberry scone, and chocolate cake all of which were just superb.

Absolute must visit when downtown, in fact go out of your way to visit here, you won't regret it.

I can't speak to vegan, gluten free, or other allergy options as they were not on my requirements when looking.</text>

This is an absolutely wonderful property. Charming and very English. Just what you want when spending a week in London. The rooms are small but the service at the front desk and in the bar and restaurant are top notch.l I would highly recommend making the Egerton your base while in London.</Text>

<review>Update: Came back to this place, haven’t had time to come back here until today once again got me the mushroom tartine sandwich, caramelized unions on top of a sourdough slice of whole wheat bread, tasted fresh too! lots of cheese, & mushrooms, i mean lots! with a side of mixed greens for 11 bucks, so worth it! for dessert i had their cranberry chocolate scone, this thing was huge & once again the product tasted fresh made that day. They got super friendly staff enough said! it was pretty busy for being one day after Christmas, i guess the people in here know this is the place to go to for fresh sandwiches, salads, & pastries, oh! had a warm cup of organic english breakfast tea, it was the icing on the cake if you get what i mean 😉👍🏽Highly recommend this place to everyone if your in the Lower Pacific Heights Neighborhood! you’ll love it!

I would recommend this place.

Great bakery for a light quick breakfast.
Be sure to ask for anything warmed up like quiches if taking things to go. I found my self eating a cold ham and cheese after making this mistake.< /Text>

The pastries were delicious.  The line was long and worth the wait.  However the two girls helping behind the counter seemed to be very short and impatient. I had my order ready and still felt like I was bothering them somehow.< /Review>

Hot chocolate was way too sweet and too soupy, need to be more thick. Croissant was good on the surface and texture, but still lacking of something in the taste compared to what I had in France.</text>

Delish. Love this place and always stop in for pastries or lunch when I am in the neighborhood. Areas of improvement needed: counter staff last couple visits were super snotty and tables were not being bussed/cleared in a timely manner to accommodate guests.</review>

Delicious pastries. Try to avoid standard rush times as line is very long. Moves quickly. Avoid ordering coffee as it takes forever.<//review>

One of the best bakeries in San Francisco. Getting here early ensures no waits and plenty of choice for the pastries. We usually come here once a week, buy a box of items and eat them every morning.< /Text>

< Review>
The Kouign Amann are delicious. Buttery layers on the inside, sugary flakes on the outside it's hard to have just one. And if you want something a bit richer, try the Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant, they manage to get half a banana in there while maintaining the classic flaky layers of a croissant.<//Review>

Giving one star purely to bring the average down. The quality of this place has gone down substantially. The baked goods can be undercooked, uninspired , and the place is messy/dirty.  It just feels like they’re churning out money instead of quality pastries.<//Text>

Really cute patisserie. Great place for a girls talk afternoon. Good coffee and pastries and they're well known for their kouign amann. (It's pretty good but i think it's too crispy and not chewy enough, but definitely worth trying!)<//review>

<Review>Holy cow, my mouth is watering just thinking abut my experience at B. Patisserie!! Amazing baked goods and pastries, also enjoyed a wonderful cappuccino with my sweets! Ambiance is adorable, (smells like butter!) great place to catch up with friends or even a small business meeting!

The "must get item" is the Kouign Amann Nature. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT ONE!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808580c961a0d5e7:0xea755410f0b98bb<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Finding B.Patisserie was one of the best and worst finds for a bakery in my life.  All of the items I have tasted are amazing, with the Kougin Amann being the highlight, I dream about it it is so good!  My only problem is that since everything is so good, I want it all the time and have to workout extra to keep off the extra pounds.  Definitely worth a visit.<//Review>

Cute patisserie with excellent pastry esp. the hard to find kouign amann or Breton cake.  They also have sandwich etc. with coffe and tea. The line is usually long indicating the popularity of this place.< /Review>

A good alternative to Tartine. The bread is delicious as are the pastries and cakes. Coffee is also very good. It gets as busy as Tartine after 10 a.m., and tables do not seem to rotate as fast.<//review>

<text>Although this place is usually crazy busy, it has all the feel of a popular Parisian patisserie. The light little space boasts a beautiful counter packed with an impressive array of both savory and sweet treats. Of course the iconic kouign-amann reigns supreme, but everything else, including cheddar-apple scones and simplistic croissants are worthy of your order. Grab an espresso and fight for a seat.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Depending on when you go, the lines can be a killer. Once you get through, order the banana chocolate almond croissant, a coffee, sit back & relax. This is the good life.</Review>

<Review>Finding B.Patisserie was one of the best and worst finds for a bakery in my life.  All of the items I have tasted are amazing, with the Kougin Amann being the highlight, I dream about it it is so good!  My only problem is that since everything is so good, I want it all the time and have to workout extra to keep off the extra pounds.  Definitely worth a visit.< /Review>< Pictures>

B. Patisserie is about four blocks from my house, which is both a blessing and a curse.  Their pastries are phenomenal, and I like to walk over on Sunday mornings to pick up a baguette and tasty treat.  Try the chocolate kouign amann, banana and chocolate hazelnut croissant, and the chocolate chip cookies with sea salt.  You will not be disappointed.

<Text>Like butter. This place is amazing. Their pastries are really good and rich, you can tell the quality of the pastries. If you are here, you have to get the Kouign Amann. Its delicious, probably because of the high butter amount in each bite.

We also got the bacon sandwich and the mushroom sandwich. I personally liked the bacon sandwich, the mushroom sandwich was a bit more bland. This place can get crowded, it's not the type of cafe you can sit with your laptop since it can get hectic on weekends.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808580c961a0d5e7:0xea755410f0b98bb<//Gmap_id></record>

The kouign amann are as good as people say. I like the chocolate ones. The crust is flaky, buttery, and absolutely delicious! Can't wait to go back to try some of their other items.</Review>

We were brought here by a local friend to try the popular Kouign Aman Nature. It is a caramelized, croissant-like flaky pastry. Loved it! Tasted so heavenly and wasn't too sweet. We also got a chocolate chip cookie and a valrhona fudge cookie, both of which were really good. Maybe a little too chocolaty for some. Everything is freshly baked. This place was packed so you know everything else should be excellent too!</Text>

At $5 per croissant i would say it's worth it in comparison with pastry prices at philz or la bolounge. However there's no comparison when it comes to freshness and taste. My only hiccup, which I won't count against, is the RBF cashier(glasses) and their paint thinner like coffee.</review>< rating>

<user_name>Cindy Nguy< /user_name><text>B Patisserie make the best Kouginon Aman!! As you walk in this cafe/restaurant, you are greeted by a line of freshly baked goods.  You won't even know where to start as they all look amazing!  They're like croissants stuffed with a sugary glazed. You have the option to get the  chocolate and seasonal fruit flavors as well.  All under $4.  There is savory pastries like bacon/cheddar scones and ham/cheese croissants.

There is also seating for breakfast and lunch.  Parking could be spotty as it's located near the Divisadero corridor.   Definitely worth checking out!</text><Time>1413474516940</Time><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmapID>

Upon first walking in to this bakery, I wasn't exactly sure how they were taking orders. There were a lot of people on that Saturday morning that I stepped inside. Lots of light and seating available and glass beautiful display case of all the gorgeous baked goods is what you are greeted with when you walk in. This place has been on my list for several months and was recommended by a co-worker friend of mine that urged me to go since I raved about all the delicacies that I found in travels in France, Germany, Italy. This is definitely a French bakery and it exceeded my expectations. I ordered a little box to be shared with my husband. The kouign amanns were just that amazing...flakey, crispy, the right amount of sweet, buttery goodness all wrapped up into one perfect pastry. I also ordered something that sounded very interesting: a pear, fig, almond filled croissant, which was also amazing. They serve four barrel coffee to go along with your desserts/pastries/breakfast. On the weekends, there is apparently more of a selection from I have been told and will check it out during a weekday to see what their selection is like.< /Text>

<text>Oh, this place is no good for a diet but I'm not even upset about it.
So B. Patisserie is no longer a secret, people will wait in long lines at all times of the day just to order a pastry but it's well worth the wait and everyone knows that.
B.Patisserie has become a Saturday tradition. I stop by on my way to go hiking and order something delish. Half of the time I have no idea what exactly I'm ordering but I don't even care because it's always good. However, if you're a tourist who is limited to visiting once, you must try the kouign amann. Hands down divine.<//text>< pictures>

One of the best bakeries in San Francisco. They have outstanding pastries and desserts and the coffee is delicious. I love the kouign Amann as well; their popular item. I highly recommend this spot. The pastry chef use to work at Gary Danko and has a Michelin star under her belt.< /review>

My favorite bakery in the city (even more so than Tartine). Their kouign amann is the best I've had in San Francisco, and they have a bunch of other awesome pastries (such as croissants).

The only minor knock on them I would have is that their coffee experience is so-so, but everything else is top notch.</text>

Food was good but counter staff was quite snooty, which was disappointing.  I got reprimanded for stepping out of line to look at pastries! They obviously think very highly of themselves. Very poor customer service.<//text>

The kougin amann is a delicious, just keep in mind that you really need to be careful or half of will be found on the floor, too Krispy maybe. Go for the bread mastery not the coffee.<//text>

Easily one of the best bakeries in the city. They have many varied options for pastries and cakes that are made fresh daily. Their open face sandwiches, Tartines, are varied and usually pretty good - they don't start serving them until about 11am though. Coffee is excellent.

My favorites: Chocolate banana croissant, kougin amann, bostock

Though there is almost always a wait, the lines moves very fast.</Review>

You know, their desserts are one of the best in San Francisco. Their chocolate chip cookie could use some work though. I'm updating with 4 stars instead of 5 because as of late, their customer service has been getting a bit snobby, especially when it comes to their imported white cardboard boxes.

I still stand by the kouign amann. I've discovered that the the kouign amann makes for the most talked about gifts :)</Review>

This is such a sweet place; not only are the pastries amazing (I had a Koiugn Amann nature and a strawberry almond croissant), but the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful. I asked which of the kouign amann were the most recently out of the oven, and after checking, told me the nature, i.e. without jam or other additions. This allowed me to sample the simple version, though it was far from simple! Ordering the strawberry almond croissant  allowed me to sample a fruity pastry, which the gal who waited on me advised was still warm from the oven, which it was, indeed, warm with a bright strawberry flavor, so good! There were all sorts of other things I'd love to try, including scones; maybe I can make it back another day while I'm visiting SF... Or next time I'm back.<//Review>

My favorite is the grande macaroon.  Kouhn Amman is her specialty.  I enjoy spending a weekend morning sitting with my breakfast pastry and cup of tea here.  In the evening, a 10 hour apple tart is a great way to end your dinner.  Front of the House Candace and Johanna are warm and friendly to everyone who enters the premise.  They take the time to explain what each item is.  When you are there, take a look at the wall, there is a macaroon tree!

There's always a line at this place, but since most people seem to be here to purchase the stellar baked goods, it goes pretty quickly. They're known for their incredible kouign amann, which they offer in a couple varieties, but do give the chocolate banana bread and pain suisse a try too.<//Text>

Food was good but counter staff was quite snooty, which was disappointing.  I got reprimanded for stepping out of line to look at pastries! They obviously think very highly of themselves. Very poor customer service.</Review>

You know, their desserts are one of the best in San Francisco. Their chocolate chip cookie could use some work though. I'm updating with 4 stars instead of 5 because as of late, their customer service has been getting a bit snobby, especially when it comes to their imported white cardboard boxes.

I still stand by the kouign amann. I've discovered that the the kouign amann makes for the most talked about gifts :)</text>

Amazing pastries and breads and cafe au laits!! This place had a line out the door on a Sunday for brunch but it moved and didn't have to wait. The kougin mann pastry was amazing!!!! It melted in your mouth, it was flaky, sweet, and buttery...just amazing!!!! The quiche waa delicious...it was light, airy and fluffy!! Yum!! The bluberry almomd croissant and almond chocolate banana croissant was another amazing pastry!!!! Both croissants were fresh, flaky, sweet and just pure delight of flavors!!!! WORTH THE VISIT!!!! WILL GO BACK...WISH I LIVED IN SF JUST FOR THIS BAKERY!!!!!!< /Review>

Great little cafe with a staff who genuinely cares about their customers.
Mainly went for the much raved about  Kouign-amann (I was recently corrected with the pronunciation of the pastry it's pronounced 'queen'-amann not kou-gen like members of my family have been pronouncing...)

There's always a line at this place, but since most people seem to be here to purchase the stellar baked goods, it goes pretty quickly. They're known for their incredible kouign amann, which they offer in a couple varieties, but do give the chocolate banana bread and pain suisse a try too.<//Review>

<text>Excellent sandwiches with the best bread so far in town!

I cannot rate it 5 stars because they don't have cappuccinos and similar hot beverages that would really go well with the nice selection of pastries they have.

Five stars for the service! The pastries, though, are a bit overrated. I've tried pretty much all the pastries. Some are really good and some are just average. Most are very rich, like the Chai Tart, so rich it can be a meal itself. At $6.5 per tart, hum...I'm not so sure.

The bakery certainly deserves the credit of being innovative and combining different ingredients/tastes in the same pastry, as in the green tea grapefruit pistachio tart and the coconut guava mango tart.

I'm a macaron fan, so I like how the macaron flavors are rotated often. However, sometimes they have the so-called "Mystery Flavors", and the staff couldn't even tell you what the flavors are. Or maybe they weren't supposed to?! A bit awkward not knowing what I was eating. The macarons are usually so sweet, that it's hard to tell what flavor it is. All the macarons I've tried are ganache filling.

Well, so much for the sweets (except for the quiche). The next time I go, maybe I'll start sampling the Tartines.< /text>

How ‘bout tweaking the topping on the “Black Forest”, instead of Cherries, try some thin slices of Strawberry, Passion Fruit and a couple of fresh Blue Berries…et voila, Foodies will add you to their Christmas lists.

One more thingy, why not re-name it with the original “Schwarz-Wald torte”, I’ll put a good word for you with The Chancellor, or, why not pick-up a theme like “Death By Chocolate”….
Either way, its finger-licking-good…

btw, your croissant are the absolutely best, I won’t tell you who’s 2nd, they're distant 2nd be assured, they do use theirs, croissant, creatively by using it for a kick a/s Croque Monsieur, something you might want to consider.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Get: kouign amann, macarons. Those two items took me back to my summer in France. Legit.

I've pretty much tried everything here (hey, carbs cure my weekend hangovers, ok?) Everything is good, but nothing that stood out like the kouign amann and macarons.

KA - Flakey, crispy, melty, warm. Its not overly sweet like most places and its not flakey to the point of being dry (cough mr. holmes)
Macarons - THE BEST MACARON I'VE HAD OUTSIDE OF FRANCE. It is a crispy shell on the outside and a moist chewy cookie underneath. I'm drooling writing about this now.
QUICHE- Almost forgot about this amazing slice of heaven. Get it.

The cookies here are good, but not as chewy as I like (more of a thin crunchy cookie) The flavored croissants are a little too raw-dough-y in the middle for me. The cakes are good depending on the flavor (some flavors change the texture of the cake and make it a bit too dry)

But yes, that line is worth it.</text>< pictures>

Great pastries. We got the plain Kuign Aman and the chocolate almond banana croissant. Both were delicious: flaky, flavorful and balanced in the sweetness although I feel the proportion of almond marzipan could have been higher in the croissant. It was so good we snagged a couple more items to go before we headed out. The Passion fruit bostock had an amazing chewy, juicy texture with crunchy caramelized edges. Yumm. The tomato and burratta sandwich was fresh and delicious too.
The cappuccino was average, but then again I live in Seattle and I know my coffee.< /text>

< Review>
Yessssssss. Hands down one of the best bakeries I've been too. This place is pretty hyped, but believe me when I say that it definitely lives up to its expectations. In my opinion, it rivals Tartine when trying to decide on the best bakery in the city. As most people have already stated, you HAVE to get the Kouign Amann. SO GOOD. It's the perfect balance of flakiness and warmth while still being sweet and fresh. I know this is the most talked about item here, so you best believe all the reviews. IT'S WORTH TRYING. Another great choice here? The chocolate banana almond-croissant. It has just the right about of gooey chocolate that's mixed in with banana and almonds. That plus a perfectly made croissant?! What more could you ask for?!?! That's definitely another must try. Yummmm. Looking for another reason to give B Patisserie bonus points?
The coffee! It never hurts that a place like this serves Four Barrel coffee, so do not fear if you think that you'll have to sacrifice great tasting coffee just to come here. This place has it all. I've only had one bad experience when coming here...you might ask, what may that be? A STREET CLEANING TICKET. And it happened because I was stupid enough to park my car without checking the street cleaning hours -______-

so beware of all parking signs!! But don't worry, that's just a tangent and has nothing to do with B Patisserie itself. Without question, this place deserves 5 stars.< /Review>

<username>Sonya Li< /username><user>114907595278616299758< /user><Review>Kouign amann translates to butter cake in Breton and it’s exactly that - the outside is crusty and it’s a dense, caramely, moist, buttery, sweet cake. When I sat down with my order, I took the prerequisite 100 pictures like a good Asian and immediately ripped a chunk with my grubby hands and shoved it into my mouth like a savage. It was light and airy, buttery, the cardamom apricot filling was the bees knees, and the fine cinnamon sugar on top made it the perfect winter treat. It was amazing. When I finally looked up, I noticed that the beautiful woman sitting next to me was elegantly knifing and forking her baked good so I brushed the crumbs off my lips, crossed my legs, straightened my back, and smiled demurely like the lotus flower I am.

Even though I sought this place out to taste their kouign amann, I ended up sampling several other treats.

My partner ordered the apple brioche tart. It was almost like a baked donut, but with a smooth vanilla custard in the center under the baked apples. It was good and my partner loved it, but it’s not on my list of favorites.

We took home the bostock and we were told it was twice baked broche soaked in passion fruit and topped off with raspberries and almonds. It’s crusty, eggy, and you can taste the passion fruit. The raspberries added enough acid to make your mouth water and greedy for another bite while the passion fruit brought a tropical feel to the dessert.

We also took home the chocolate banana smores tart which was surprising good because I hate bananas in my desserts. They tend to be over ripened and I have a distain for the fermented taste. The chocolate wasn’t too heavy, but the crust was too hard and there wasn’t enough s’mores for an even distribution of each element in evert bite.

If you visit, you’ll find Belinda Leong working hard behind the counter and it just makes everything so much sweeter.</Review>< GmapID>

Most everything else was expensive and not worth the carbs or the $$$.< /text>

(Translated by Google) They sell really good bread. The pie is incredibly delicious, but the savory and crispy crunchy taste is excellent. It wasn't expensive, so it came out with a bunch, but it was about $ 18. There are so many people that you have to wait.

(Original)
정말 맛있는 빵을 팝니다. 특히 파이가 미칠 듯이 맛있는데, 고소하고 파삭파삭 부서지는 맛이 일품입니다. 가격도 비싸지 않아서 잔뜩 들고 나왔는데도 18달러 정도였어요. 사람이 엄청 많으니 기다리셔야 할 겁니다.< /Text>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The texture is not too greasy, and the sweetness is suitable for the entrance. However, it is recommended that you first taste a few before you decide to buy other styles of pastry and bread (the bread crust is slightly burnt and bitter, but it depends on your preference). Fortunately, the waiter is fluent, or there is a chance to get a seat on the spot

(Original)
質感上不會太油膩，香甜度適合入口，但是建議購買時要先少數嚐過後做決定購買其他款式西點與麵包類（麵包類外皮稍微銬焦帶苦感，但是看自己喜好度），人潮不在話下還好是服務員動作流利，還是有機會可以當場座位嚐鮮< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwkR9fBcKyU18HZ64eC5w6wwfz162lGuSVpPqu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>
