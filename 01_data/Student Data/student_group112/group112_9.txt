Hubby got the taco plate and also liked it.
Nice service and music. It has this machine where you can pick any song you wanna listen too.
Highly recomended place.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJrTaCrSVwihlsIJq9ddjrom70PYhejizBARhE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3wpYufWWPuX0H_K4b39EkOwu7Tcw0xmTrdf5t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQ4YluR4gYMYXJ5txKjquGV-0ynbDRyADFf5jl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObmJ9RA_3r5f26qWUOgEfodIMuy_btxtFPKnoQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb0a5090fe3fb:0x417f6c88b90480c9</Gmap_id></record>

Damn good tacos. I went mid afternoon and there was a huge line for the restaurant. Took a good 20 mins after ordering to get them, but they are worth it. Asada and Carnitas were my favorite and I could pass on the chicken. They had some sauces, but none of them were memorable.<//review>

After the gym and a bike ride at Shoreline I took Gavin here to refuel.  We were both hungry and was ready to feast.  I don't eat papusas often but for some reason I felt that it was my destiny to consume some.  This restaurant is very small and it gets busy and after eating here I can see why.

Service was spotty.  I couldn't tell if they were short because they were busy or if it's because they didn't care or was annoyed that it was busy.  That was the impression I felt.. because this place was busy I sent Gavin off to fend for himself so he can hunt down a table for us whilst I order and pay.  We tag team all the time when we need to.  He found a table whilst I ordered the chicken burrito bowl, a chicken burrito (w/o the pico), and their beef papusa.

Gavin's burrito and my burrito bowl (really a plate) was served w/in 15 minutes which isn't bad but the papusas took awhile.  They do make everything fresh but still.. 25-30 minutes for papusas isn't what I was expecting.  I had to go up and ask.

The papusas were delicious.. I will learn how to make it myself.<//text>

<text>Went and ordered some carne asada tacos while I dined in and took some pupusas to go. The pupusas here are way too greasy. It’s hard to find pupusas that aren’t very greasy and here wasn’t any exception. I’ll just stick to the tacos and find another dish.<//text>< pics>

Awesome restaurant made salsa (red and green) in squeeze bottles.  I hate hate hate overpriced Mexican high brow restaurants that charge you $12 for 3 tacos.  This is the opposite of that!< /text>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Just when I was starting to complain that there aren’t any good, real restaurants in Mountain View, lo and behold, Rincon Sabroso shows up to save the day. I feel that I am entitled to share an opinion for this particular cuisine having lived in El Salvador. The pupusas were just exquisite and perfect: the revuelta mix didn’t skimp on ingredients inside and the hot salsa had the right balance between savory and spicy. This is my new go-to for Salvadoran food!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This Mexican/Salvadoran restaurant is very near our house but tucked back into the corner of a shopping center so we didn’t ever notice it for some time. Huge loss on our part! The pupusas and plantain plate are delicious. They’re really quite vegetarian friendly with no animal products in the pupusas masa or the beans. Try the off menu jalapeño cheese  pupusas and make sure to wait for their curtido (slaw) and fresh hot sauce before you dig in.<//review>

<Text>The food is ok, but the service this time was terrible, waited for 30 minutes for my order and nothing, so I went to ask and they went to fetch it from the pre-prepared containers they have.
It virtually could’ve taken 5 minutes after I placed my order, just pour from their container into the serving bowl, done.
It was lame I wasted 30 minutes waiting, plus because you paid up front, I put the tip ahead of time, so, not even a way to not tip them this time.
On top of that, not even an apology.
I would come again, but this visit really sucked.< /Text>< Pictures>

I travel from Santa Clara just to enjoy their food. The ladies and help are really hard workers and sometimes you have a line of people as they can not keep up with so many customers.

Such great food. Their sauces are delicious! I personally recommend trying their red sauce with your burrito. It's perfect for those who like to add a bit of a kick to their food!</text>

<text>Very little restaurant that seems quite authentic. I've only been once and just for pupusas that were very delicious. The Salvadoran menu sticks to papusas and platano. I did see a lot of burritos go out the door. Only Spanish spoken here.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>Great food. Their carnitas are awesome however this time I placed an order via phone for pick up and I ordered 2 wet burrittoes but when I got them they were regular burrito. However they didn't charge me for the wet ones so really no harm no foul.< /text>< Pictures>

Great place to get Mexican food or dishes from El Salvador. The ladies that work here are polite and provide good service. I've been coming here for lunch for about a year now and the quality has always been great. They cook the food behind the counter and it's always freshly made. The salsas are really good. Try the super burritos, nacho plates, or pupusas.<//text>

I usually come here for a late night dinner after a long day at work. They are usually open until 10 on weekdays.

They have a wide selection of food. I would suggest getting the papusas. They make it right in front of you after you order. I have had the enchiladas and burritos too. The meat is usually very juicy and flavorful. They have a liquor license and offer various beers.

The location isn't great (The shopping center it is located in can seem dark and deserted at night), but the restaurant itself is clean. The menu is large and easy to read and the staff wear custom shirts with the name of the restaurant. I think the owners are doing a good job of keeping the quality of the dining experience up.</review>

The place is a classic dive: dingy atmosphere & good food. The Sopes, pupusas, and caldo we got where on point.

*though sad to say they didn't have loroco.< /text>

<Review>A good Salvadoran dive. Food was good, but this is a cramped place, not much space between tables so get comfortable with your neighbors.

My only real issue with the place was the meat and pupusas filling options. I was just surprised they didn't have queso con locroco, and was hoping they had pillo adobado.

Otherwise it hit the spot, sopes, caldo, and pupusas are all on point.<//Review>< pics>

<review>This place has amazing food. Reviewers who  complain about slow service should go to taco bell.

Good authentic food with great taste. The meat is juicy and tender and the service is friendly. You will need to know the mexican/Salvadoran kitchen a bit I'm order to understand the menu.
The restaurant is not the nicest looking but who cares when the food is good and plentiful.< /text>

<text>I have been coming to this place for a quick bite and for the most part it's been okay... Today was not the case!

1) There was no greeting.

2) During ordering... when asked to modify one of my four plates the staff acted as if I had such an inconvenience.

3) Such a bad stomach ache afterwards.

Sorry, I know Jose but this is no way to do food.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Love the giant,  flavorful tamales, and they make the pupusas to order.  The wet burrito with the spicy sauce is also amazing - like a delicious cross between pizza and burritos. They made the carnitas extra crispy,  and the fresh onions and cilantro was also a nice touch.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1535053977664, 'text': 'Thank you! we also have delivery service this is the direct link from our kitchen to your table.\nhttps://meseras.com/menu-rincon-sabroso'}</Response><user_id>116021959418302995828<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Food (Mexican/Salvadorian) is delicious!  the service isn't that great but it's tolerable. The pupusas are perfect because they are not greasy at all. Best part is they serve alcohol.</Text>

They will be getting one star from me due to the fact they have on more than one occasion switched an item I ordered through waiter. Their excuse is they ran out, my orders are put in advance so there should be no reason for this to happen.</Text>

<Review>Horrible!!!!! Hmmm I am not sure what kind of people are reviewing this place, to say “great food” and “clean”???
So, I come from Los Angeles (traveling for work), we came here given the good reviews...First of all, we came in and we notice a bunch of whole chickens on the floor and you see more on a bloody bucket and the lady is picking up each one and putting it on the heat of the stove burning it. I actually asked what they were doing and the cashier mentioned, the lady was burning away the feathers to use the chicken for soup (Yuck!). Anyways, we proceeded to order....I ordered 3 popusas and my husband the enchiladas plate. It took a veryyyyyyy longggggg time to get our food. I was actually excited thinking they were going to be great since it appeared they were making it from scratch...WRONG!!! The popusas are the WORST I have ever had. PLAIN, no flavor, a bunch of flour and not much of the actual filling. My husbands enchiladas were better then the popusas but not the greatest. We wouldn’t come here ever again and don’t recommended. We still question, why does it have so many good reviews? Either these are fake or people up here don’t have taste buds.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>A lack luster, hole in the wall establishment with very friendly customer service. We ordered papusas and taco plates.  I appreciated the lady making papusas to order. We were there on a weeknight half an hour before closing time. After we ordered, I noticed they were starting to clean up for the day.  Unfortunately, that's when I saw that the cooks didn't wash their hands between handling the food ( making papusas, picking up toppings to put on the tacos, etc) and wiping down the counters/clearing the plates/cleaning the tables. Made the experience less than appetizing.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808fb0a5090fe3fb:0x417f6c88b90480c9</Gmap_id>< Name>

Carne asada burrito never fails. Ever. Consistently delicious. Last time I went, pupusa was solid (crisp outside, delicious melty pork Bean and cheese inside) and chicken tacos were pretty good (only because of the crisp taco shell). Otherwise have been hit or miss on tastiness of pupusa and tacos.</Review>

It was okay  carnitas were good and the real handmade tortillas too.  But the carne asada was nasty they cook the fish on same grill as meat so it has a fishy taste!   The lady didnt understand when ordering so I got all this food that I didn't want but whatever food is pretty cheap so I guess that's why I didn't know when we paid.  Will I go back No way better food in the area!</text>

I've only tried pupusas there, they are okay--tend to be very big but they are tasty. Service can be slow but overall is good place to quench your hunger.</review>

Pupusa are good,  tortillas chip are not fresh, no salsa to go with them. The menudo stay away from it, its terrible, tripes were not soft and probably under cook, no corn , broth verify light and no flavor. I would not recomend this place, I spend $ 17.00  for 2 pupusa could not chow down the10.00 menudo.<//Text>

<Name>Exit Kiwi</Name><Date>1369028061953< /Date><Rating>4<//Rating><Text>I love pupusas, so I get excited every time I find a place that serves them. They're excellent here. Greasy (unfortunately this is expected) but flavorful and filling. They don't skimp on the cheese/meat etc., and have different options for fillings. The people running the restaurant were happy to provide extra curtido when I asked and generally friendly.

The pupusas here are better than at Taqueria La Bamba, I think. But the parking lot is less convenient and the interior is not the cutest. It's pretty small and basic. I typically carry-out and definitely recommend this place. Just... maybe not for an anniversary dinner :)</Text>< pictures>

Best pupusas I've had in the area.  I like the beans, cheese, and loroco pupusa; not sure exactly what loroco is beyond "tasty".  This place is under new management; the prices went up, but so did the quality.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The service is terrible. They never have anything to eat. Waters to drink almost never have. Meats only have 2 available. Milanesas never have available. Pupusas only made of cheese and they don't taste good. 10 minutes for them to attend you and tell you that nothing you want is available. It is not worth coming to this place .....

<Review>Decent neighborhood sushi joint. It's got some solid menu items, but there's a few misses sprinkled in there. Sushi is of an alright freshness and cut. Service was fine, too. Seems to be a family run business< /Review>< pics>

NI-MO's has been our go-to place in San Mateo for years for both amazing, fresh take-out sushi and bento boxes, as well as their great patio seating. I love their hand-rolls in particular. This is a family run place, very family friendly, with high quality fish and reasonable prices (especially on Tuesdays, when sushi is 20% off!).< /text>

<Text>NI-MO's has been my favorite place to eat sushi since I moved here about 5 years ago. My husband introduced me to it when we were dating. He has been going here for years. Wonderful food. Excellent service. Steve makes a magnificent hand roll that I always order from him. We enjoy the conversation and food. Thank you NI-MO's for such amazing service.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We randomly bumped into Ni-Mo for lunch. It was between the two places next door so this seemed like the best option.

There are 3-4 small tables on the sidewalk with 4 tables under the large awning. They are a good distance away from each other. They did not have one-use menus though.

I got the 5 handrolls combo which came with soup and salad. The rolls were pretty large, but they didn't taste good at all. Super pass.

The servers don't seem to be paying too much attention to the "line". An older couple came and asked for a table and was told to wait by the sushi chef who happened to peak outside. Then a younger couple came by 5-10 minutes later but was misunderstood to be first in line by one of the servers. The older couple waited an extra 20 minutes for their table.</Text>

The pricing is extremely reasonable given Bay Area rents (12 buck lunches).  The portions in the lunch bento box were generous. The service was very efficient and friendly enough.  The hot tea was great - not too weak or strong.  There are vegetarian and omnivore options.  Seating is accessible,  armless. Place is clean,  food is fresh. Ambience is fine, but not amazing.  I think the flavors are not quite there to merit 5 stars,  but it is quite good.   Parking is usually on the same block.  To be honest I'm a little surprised given the good value and consistency that they aren't more crowded.  It may be folks prefer a peppier more hands on cheerleader type of server, or the slightly diner feel isn't fancy enough ambience for some. I like the things they do to be efficient like leaving the pot of tea,  the pitcher of water so you can refill yourself.  I know some folks prefer the more hands on hovering type of service that feels a bit more pampered,  but tbh I have always found that level of service a bit elitist. I appreciate not having a hawk like watchfulness to see when my last sip is gone and rush in to fill.  I find it more relaxing to do that for myself.
Somehow they've found the right balance of ensuring every need gets met (noticing when they forgot an item, quick to respond when we indicated wanting assistance -check) with allowing the space to not be overbearing. Only been here a couple of times,  but I'm sure we will continue to enjoy this venue when in the area.</text>

Food is not bad. Some dishes better than other. But the service definitely needs improvement. One of the ladies there is miserable and definitely should not be in the food industry. The other lady, Steven, and the younger girl are good. I don't think I'll be going back as there are a lot of other options. When I was there recently, we were treated as if we were unwelcome.</text>

It's not bad. I could probably go higher than three stars. Stick with the standard Japanese items. Don't order the short ribs which is Korean - not that good, meat too tough.
The owner husband and wife work really hard to make a living. There's too much competition in that area.<//review>

Reasonable prices, decent food and good service even though the people who run the business are not Japanese.
No inside seating is available during the pandemic. However patio seating is available.< /text>

Solid lunch spot. Had their lunch combo with chicken katsu and pork katsu. It came with a salad, bowl of rice, and miso soup for $10.95. Chicken katsu was made of thigh meat not breast which made it a little too fatty and oily for me. Overall good affordable lunch option in San Mateo. Don’t get their kalbi (beef short ribs) since the marinade is too bitter and the meat is too thin and get easily overcooked. We didn’t have to wait for a table either which was good. Service could be faster though.<//Text>

Just ordered take out from them. The fish wasn’t fresh at all. I put a California roll in my mouth and I couldn’t swallow because it was rancid. Sashimi was very very thick cut, not thin. Really nice people inside just not good quality ingredients.< /Text>

Want delicious, quiet, unique spot try this place inin San Mateo although the parking can be an issue you will not regret having the Bay island sushi along with the spider one and the Dragon sushi. The service here is amazing you will feel welcome from the time you walked in the sushi specialist will actually greet you as if you were family it's amazing!< /review>

Food is decent and service is good. We order Benton box for lunch and the servings are huge. We almost can't finish. And it's not that expensive either. They also got out door seating, good for hot sunny day.<//Review>

Unbeatable price for a set of multiple nigiris that come with soup and salad. The wait for food to be served around 7pm was a little long but it was a Saturday.  Quality of fish is decent and cut of fish was very generous.< /Text>

I ordered the assorted nigiri premium for pick up and ate it immediately. 2 of the first 4 fish were so tough and fiberous I couldn’t eat them and decided not to eat the rest, which I never do with sushi. Easily the worst sushi experience I’ve had in years, and I am surprised by how many positive reviews they have.</Review>

The chirashi sushi rice had a nice tang and the large pieces of sashimi were fresh and tender. As we love sashimi, we also ordered the premium sashimi platter. The slices were thick/generous, fresh, and delish! Yay! We found ourselves a new, favorite restaurant.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Ordered Oregon role, and it tasted awful (I eat sushi all the time and am not picky). I went to speak with chef who told me that something is wrong with me if I think his sushi is bad. “Must be your problem,” he said. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. Dash sushi around the corner is excellent.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I've been here 3 times now. Once, dine in, once, carry out, and once, delivery (via a 3rd party). All 3 times the food was very good. I tend to judge a Japanese restaurant by their agadashi tofu and theirs is hella good.< /Review>

<review>Quality for the price is rather phenomenal. Really enjoyed the fish, and ended up paying half what I was expecting. Would recommend for a regular go-to sushi spot. Tonkatsu was also pretty good.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Service was great. The sushi was solid but not exceptional. The miso was excellent.

This is a great spot for a regular lunch, but probably not a fancy dinner.< /Text>

<Text>I was there for dinner and ordered the beef sukiyuki and the Ni-Mo special sushi rolls. The sushi was delicious. The beef sukiyuki not so much, but you did get tons of food, like endame, salad and rice that came with it.</Text><gmapID>0x808f9e704bf47b1d:0x1bd023b7bbd6f54c< /gmapID><name>Ge Lo<//name>< time>

<review>Stopped for late lunch during the holidays. Nice lunch menu with an assortment of noodle, sushi and bento box options. All reasonably priced. Very good tekka don and seaweed salad. Others had assorted sushi plate, all fresh and tasty and large portions and donburi was filling too. Nice little place with great service. Will return for sure.<//review>< pics>

The prices are fair and the owner and staff are some of the friendliest people I've met. They have great vegetarian rolls and I've been told the sashimi is the best around. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!< /review>

For basic sushi and sashimi, you can't beat this place. Fish is expertly cut and portions are generous. The rice in the sushi is nicely flavored.
Excellent agadashi tofu, too!
I have had sushi in may San Mateo restaurants in the past month, and none beat Ni Mo. For the freshest fish, the best portions and best sushi rice, Ni Mo beats them all, hands down.
If you are looking for clever fusion food, go elsewhere. For Japanese food, this is IT.</Review>

Excellent Food! Great prices for bento box! I love this place. I been coming here for a few months now and this place is awesome. Never had a bad experience. Best thing is that they have their specials to go! Most Sushi places around here say "NO" to specials to go while here they say "YES"! Thanks Ni-Mo Japanese Cuisine.</Text>

The food is great here, but the service is hit or miss, at times it's fine where drinks are regularly refilled and the check is presented at a reasonable time, other times, I can wait thirty minutes to see my server again after I've been given my food.</review>

In a town rich with sushi restaurants, this is my personal favorite. Great service, homely atmosphere, and good sushi. Hard to beat.</Review>

< Review>
First of all the lady looked unhappy the whole time she was taking our order when it was time to pay we explain to her that we would pay separately she made a mistake about the payment and got mad at us not only that but she yelled at us and she start talking in Mandarin with the other employee and obviously we could tell she was talking about us. We were explaining it to her but she didn't give us a chance to speak.</Review>

I ordered the deluxe chirashi for $$$ and the sashimi was practically frozen. Super cold and the quality of the fish was bad. The uni tasted off and I love uni. I was looking forward to it and the quality of this place did not live up to the 4.3 stars that it has.

The waitress was rude enough to suggest that I may not have an acquired taste. They did not take the chirashi off the bill when I sent it back.<//text>

<Review>It was ok. Service was fast and the staff nice, but the fish came up in huge chunks. It was like eating raw fish steaks than sashimi which should be sliced thinner.< /Review>< pictures>

Location location location!  Lived here for there years now.  There are issues here as others have stated in their reviews but you are going to have that any place you live.  Overall I will take the lack of parking and other small issues because this truly is a lifestyle living here.  The park is walking distance to everything you need in life.  Including the ocean!  Plus I am very fortunate to be surrounded by really good neighbors which is important when living in a mobile home park with no distance between us.<//text>

Great location and I had resisted any poor reviews prior to moving in assuming. Despite the lack of visitors parking available as most use the spots as second permanent resident parking spots, unfortunately during my stay I've become very disappointed with management, several  instances concerning safety have occurred. Several instances of my door knob simply falling off out of nowhere occurred leaving a hole in my door, which management did not see this as a safety issue each time this was brought to their attention. This morning I was told that having a hole in my door was not a safety concern and the handy man would be by sometime tomorrow between 8am - 5pm to fix it. Why was this not fixed properly after the first occurrence and how am I to leave my home like this while I am at work?  Furthermore, instances of strangers moving my shed right up to the balcony was also not addressed in any way my management nor was there any concern. Strangers leaving random notes leaving phone numbers on my car were also again of no of concern with management. While the inside of my rented mobile home is nice, I'm disappointed in the way management has deal with such issues. Every rental community has pros and cons, I would expect safety issues to be prioritized. I will be moving out prior to my lease being expired for these reasons. I hope future residents will receive better service for this luxury rent being charged by this management company. I'll keep you guys updated on how much of my deposit I get back after hiring my own carpet cleaning professional and professional to clean the place the entire prior to my move out inspection...<//Review>

Steps from the sand! Monthly rent is fraction of comparable housing.
1 block from Huntington Beach pier and Main street. Great place to live affordably on the beach!< /text>

<Text>Pros  Best location. Cute little homes.  Really great little community and close to everything.   A block from the beach!

The cons.  Zero parking.  You only get one spot per house most homes. Some have two. Lots of loud cars and motorcycles race down Huntington street occasionally so if your sensitive or easily annoyed by loud sounds but there are plenty of quiet times too.  Occasional construction as they build new homes so be prepared for that too.

Over all an amazing place to live and I’m very happy here.<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< username>

<review>Well, if you're looking to rent a mini-house a short walk from the beach and you can afford the cost, this is the place. Unfortunately the, uh, "developers" are buying out/forcing all the long-term residents to give up their homes to make room for these mini-houses. Most of the residents have been there for decades and cannot afford to move. Bad karma.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Star, the new management company, has unabashedly decided to enforce it's policy of allowing only wealthy, single-car, no guests, no children, conformist, quite residents who enjoy sadistically being singled-out and forced to continually evolve to bolster management's maniacal, egotistic, money grubbing, power-tripping minds to be granted continued residency. They'll decide if you sell your home or give it to them. Common sense, decency, kindness, compassion and adhesion of law are not traits instilled in their heartless, soulless, cold-blooded, evil bodies. Unless, you're not a resident yet!< /Review></record>

<Text>Don't know much about this place, aside from a quick visit recently. It's a good location, but very run down. From what I understand the space rent continues to climb, forcing people to move.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>So many reviews about a horrible lady on the phone. I spoke to one and she was super nice. Told me that they were packed with appointments post covid, so the soonest consultation was 2 months away. Had to find another place. But, like, once again. Lady. Super nice. 5 stars.< /Review></record>

<text>I had 2 wisdom teeth removed at Crown Dental in National City a few years back and I was in miserable pain after,  I put off getting my other 2 wisdom teeth removed for as long as I could because of this. Then I got referred to Park Blvd. Oral Surgery this time and wow this place was way better. One lady at the front was slightly rude however, the rest of the staff is pretty awesome and caring. I'm very satisfied with this place as I am in minimal pain and recovering fast. I highly recommend this place, and will be returning for any future oral surgeries. Thank you!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1621889694096, 'text': 'Thank you for taking a minute to share your thoughts with us, Thomas!

<text>Receptionist was very rude. I called because I was referred and immediately she seemed like she didn’t want to even schedule me. First thing out her
mouth was we don’t do emergency extractions when I was clearly referred for an extraction, then went on to say how long it takes for insurance to be accepted and there weren’t any appointments until the end of sept in a very rushing tone brushing me off! Very helpful right, basically we’re busy and I’m going to tell you all the negative things so you can go somewhere else. Glad she doesn’t do the extractions!

Disgusting service. If you don’t like your job, quit!<//text>< Rating>

I’m very disappointed. I had oral surgery here. They sent me home with someone else’s prescriptions, their full address, name all of their information. And didn’t give me mine. So after calling
, they filled two out of three they were suppose to give me. After about 3  pm, they stopped answering the phone and didn’t return my phone call. Mind you it’s a Friday, they are closed Saturday and Sunday. I called the doctor to tell him, he told me to text him my info and he would send that last prescription over. He never did: I had to call him yet again hours later because he never sent it, for him just to tell me I should be fine for the weekend. This is so unprofessional, and the fact that I got someone else’s personal information means they gave mine to someone else as well.

And I did not use my real name, seeing that someone took all my personal info home with them.<//Text>

I was charged $140 for a consultation. The consultation involved waiting over thirty minutes to see a doctor. All he told me was they could remove my wisdom teeth he then looked at my paperwork and escorted me out of the room. I am very disappointed, $140 for three minutes. I was then told about my treatment plan in front of other patients, HIPAA violation.< /text>

I've had an oral infection from a broken tooth for OVER 6 MONTHS I've struggled with that has effected my job performance among other things with several consultations and many E.R. visits. I finally thought i had found help here although my appointments was 2 months out. All assistants and doctors were a delight but when it was time to make my appointment i was treated with CRUELTY!! Not only did reception seemed ANNOYED for me asking about my health care coverage Towards the end i was DISRESPECTED and refused service for not being available for the first few open appointments and inquiring as to why my availability was such an issue. As a single pregnant mother of a two year old with two jobs living over an hour away from the clinic my schedule is tight due to work and other appointments on my only day off in the week. Expecting to have to wait 2 more months like the first appointment I was doing the best i could to plan a time in the upcoming weeks when my daughter was taken care of and i could afford the travel expense.

< Review>
If I could give this place 0 stars I would!!

PARKING: When I first got here I struggled to find parking. Before my arrival I called this place and told them if the parking was an issue. The staff had told me there was no issues with parking. Very minimal parking availability.

ARRIVAL INSIDE THE OFFICE:  I got to the front door and read their sign before entering. The sign said that I had to have all my documents ready to show. So I followed the directions and as I walk in ready to hand my papers this lady named Merlly said in a rude way that she will not accept my papers unless I went first and washed my hands. If that is your guys first priority you should have that posted on the door outside.

THE BATHROOM: So I enter the bathroom to wash my hands. There’s barely any soap in there. The faucet is literally so wobbly. It felt like it was about to fall off. You guys should invest on remodeling your bathroom for your patients.

MERLLY: As I was filling out the paperwork I witnessed Merlly being rude to this elderly couple. They arrived on time of their appointment. Yet Merlly said in a very rude way that they had to come back 30 minutes later. The elderly couple were confused of why they needed to wait longer than what their appointment was. Merlly explained in a rude way that only 5 people at a time could be in the waiting room at a time due to covid protocols. You guys should not overbook patients that will maximize your lobby capacity and you should aware patients ahead of time that because of covid protocols that there’s a chance they are going to wait a much longer time then their appointment check in time.</Review>

<review>I went on June 1 which is still during the COVID-19 and had to go with a mask and only 4 people in the waiting room. But everything was fast I didn’t spend much time waiting, I had to wash my hands, they took my temp(which is good because they actually are going by hygienic standards during these times)got there filled a few forms and there was about two people ahead of me.
Finally it was my turn they put me to sleep because I had to get ALL my wisdom teeth out. I thought I was asleep for 5 min because I didn’t feel any pain when I woke up. In reality I think they took almost an hour which is pretty quick to have all my wisdom teeth removed.
I had to wait about 40 min for the effects of the general anesthesia to wear off because I was still dizzy and then they gave me medication and they wheelchaired me to my dedicated driver who picked me up in the back. Staff was really nice to me, from the receptionist to the doctor.

Update: It’s been about three weeks since I had them removed and it honestly took almost two weeks to not feel any pain anymore but that is just the pain that comes with wisdom teeth removal. I didn’t get any infections and I feel I had a smooth healing process.<//review><date>1592938238306<//date>< name>

I had a great experience here! I was so nervous going since I was there to get my top wisdom teeth out, but they made it so comfortable for me. The nurse took my blood pressure and as I was waiting for the oral surgeon they let me watch my favorite show, and that for sure helped my anxiety! They used IV sedation and I stayed asleep the whole time and woke up to them telling me I was all set to leave. They did a great job, and was super friendly to me.<//Text>

4.5.The only problem we encountered was the wait time which is understandable since it is one of the few oral surgery/wisdom tooth extraction places in San Diego. The staff and surgeons were very generous and calm which made me feel secure and well taken care of. All of my wisdom teeth had to be extracted and I was put to sleep. I felt no pain or drowsiness whatsoever. I also had no infections. I would reccomend arriving there 30 minutes before your appointment so that you can be seen as soon as possible.<//Review>

Yes I get it it’s crowded and yes I get that they schedule too many patients at once making the wait very long. But the staff is very professional and they are so funny! When I went for the consultation, the waiting room was crowded but when they finally attended me it was quick and they were kind. They told me before hand that it was not an appointment, they do consultations and it’s basically first come first serve so there is definitely a long wait apart from the time they tell you! Which is WHY I took a whole day off work. Then I came back to get all of my 4 wisdom teeth in one procedure and one of the employees gave me a tip! If you schedule for a procedure at 9am you don’t have to deal with the crowded waiting room or the long waits. Sure enough there was like 3 people when I got there. Came in at 9am was out by 11am with little to no pain. I was nervous about the whole procedure but they were nice enough to explain the kind of anesthesia they were using, which they put through my IV, didn’t feel a thing. 😊< /Review>

<Review>The staff was subpar, not friendly, definitely there just to do a job, and I wonder what you have to do to get a smile or any sort of friendly gesture. Wheres the customer service? When the front desk showed me my coverage was only for about half of the procedure, I did get a little emotional. I'm in severe pain from wisdom teeth and now I have to pull $1500 from nowhere. The only payment plan is a credit card you can apply for otherwise you have to pay upfront. I'm 22 and relatively responsible but I don't have 1500 to just hand over. She asked "do you know how insurance works?" Wow. The condescending comment was unnecessary and just made matters worst. I just left. In horrible pain and tears. There was no sympathy, no flexible payment options, nothing. I can't blame them for the price but they could've handled that a lot better considering I'm a customer who was in an immense amount of pain and they obviously only cared about the money. The assistant who took my X-rays was nice and funny and made me feel a little more at ease. So thank you for that! Otherwise don't bother with this place when there's dozens of oral surgeons in San Diego with flexible payment plans and great customer care.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Poor customer service through the phone & I can imagine when I go through person.

I’m reporting them to the state medical board. They have let me sit with this painful tooth in my mouth for over a month and when insurance wouldn’t approve the anesthesia, I HAD TO call them and get the ball rolling on a prior authorization with a three way call. It was denied again and they NEVER bothered to call me and tell me that so I might seek out someone that COULD help me. They were rude and the employee that does the scheduling was abominably rude. GO ELSEWHERE for your dental needs and I hope the state medical board shuts them down. Bad people that do NOT care about your pain of dental health. Btw, I never requested pain meds even once.< /Review>

<text>Appointment was for 2:30, I arrived at 1:45 to fill out paperwork for a consultation. They called me at 2:45 and was out by 3:00.

I rate it three stars because the service from the staff is not bad at all just the wait is a pain. The staff is super kind and truly care about your well being and ease your worries. The only thing that I hate about this place is the wait. I had my surgery at 11 and didn't go in until 2:30. But overall, it's an okay place to get the job done</text>

I’m not a fan of dental work AT. ALL.  The sound of the drill, the needles etc, it’s all just unpleasant and i’d prefer not to have to be involved with any of it.

I had a broken molar that really should have come out forever ago but due to my disdain for the experience, I just kept making excuses.  Dr Podstreleny came highly recommended and so, I took the plunge and made an appointment.

On the day of the appointment, the staff was excellent, instantly putting me at ease and getting me through all of the preliminaries.  Dr Podstreleny came in, took a look and told me he’d have me fixed up in no time.

From the novacaine (Which I didn’t feel going in) to the extraction being finished was about 15min, INCLUDING the 5min or so wait to get numb.  Very mild discomfort that can be expected when having a tooth pulled out but other than that, piece of cake and recovering nicely.

I’d absolutely recommend Park Blvd Oral Surgery and dental implant center for anyone needing services that their dentist doesn’t provide. (If only they were also general dentists, I’d have all of my families dental needs met here)<//Review>

Had a 10:30 appointment for removal of wisdom teeth and waited FOUR AND A HALF hours to be seen.

I understand taking some time to get you in for such a procedure as oral surgery, however this long is absolutely ridiculous. Especially considering it was required someone came with me to drive me home, so myself and my girlfriend now both have had to take full days off work.

According to the receptionist this is standard procedure for this place, so if you unfortunately have to come here keep that in mind.

Small waiting room, crazy arguing homeless people, receptionists were at least friendly and accommodating. The one I had spoken to repetitively was apologetic and was as helpful as possible.

When on the brink of cancellation, a large blonde shorthaired lady from the back came and spoke close to my face and overly aggressive explaining that I could cancel or wait longer as if I was in the wrong for requesting an update after nearly 5 hours of wait time.

With all that being said, actual procedure and follow up was professional and promptly.<//Text>

Horrendous experience. I had a consultation appointment at 2:30. At 3, I wasn’t seen. I asked when I would be seen and the lady at the front desk said in 15 minutes. Half an hour later, I asked again. She said there were 3 patients ahead of me. 5 patients later I asked again, she said she would check again. The whole waiting room went before me. I was seen around 4:30. I mean, seriously?? I finally got pulled back and they took one x Ray that took 2 minutes. I waited 2 hours.. to go back for 2 minutes. Guess that’s what “consultations” are now a days.

Surgery day, I’m scheduled to get all 4 wisdom teeth removed. Surgery is done, I’m loopy and my dad asked, “so all 4 teeth are out right?” “Yes, they’re all gone”. 3 weeks into my recovery, I develop a large, hard lump in my cheek. I go to the dentist and guess what they find? A wisdom tooth! They left one. After we established from the beginning that all 4 are to be taken out. And it caused me a lot of pain. Of course I’m upset and when I ask them what the deal was, they said they told me about it when I woke up. Umm... is this something you guys do? Make decisions without the patient’s consent? Then tell them about it when they are loopy from anesthesia?? And lie about it? They said I would get the chance to talk to the dentist over the phone exclusively, as they would call me back. And guess what? They never called me back.

Please, go somewhere else for your surgery. Now I have to go through this whole process over again for that last tooth when the whole point was to get them all removed at once for free. I’d much rather pay for quality service. Something they lack.</Review>

Surgery went fine but the after care and manner of the staff is horrible.  My job request a note since I was still having swelling and pain to make accommodations so I could take breaks between calls since it was making the pain worse. When asked to provide said note I was told they don't provide those type of notes. What doctor's office doesn't first ask if you'll need a note for work or say they don't provide them at all.

Quick to take the insurance money but can't do something as simple as write a note.  Complaint has been filed. Should've read the reviews before coming here. Definitely won't be returning.</text>

A horrible customer service experience!!!! Because they called me one hour before my surgery to tell me that my insurance wasn’t approved and even though I had them contacting my insurance for approval first before my surgery and they were working back and forth with my insurance company for 2 weeks ahead of time and they even called me the day before my surgery letting me know that I was scheduled for my surgery!!!!!  Honestly I don’t even wanna click on the 1 star button because there customer service is absolutely horrible and they never answered the phone either and they don’t return calls either. And they just totally disrespect customers! And after all us customers are the ones who are paying there salary and keeping them in business. So please , please, pass up Park Boulevard Oral Surgery and check out another surgical center on Yelp that has good reviews. Because there are plenty on here and I found another Dentist Surgical center that took good care of me and I didn’t have to come out of my pocket at all for the difference of $697.00 like they wanted me to.< /text>

They made her call me to pick her up at 12:30, I left work to pick her up and she wasn't even seen yet. The place is annoyingly packed and the customer service is horrible. They lie to you when you ask if it's almost ready. I understand why this place has two stars. This place should be shut down for unprofessionalism.

I had an appointment with Dr.Steven Podstreleny, DDS and when I arrived the office was packed with people. I was told to bring my X-rays from the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center to give to the receptionist.I had a list of medications etc.however, that wasn't the point. I didn't expect to be put inside of a dental examination waiting room for - it just have been well over one hour.
While I was in this waiting room - which was cold inside - I noticed a small sign indicating that I was not only being videotaped, but also "voicetaped."
Welcome to "the brave new world." That old 60's novel has finally become a reality and no matter what we say, do or wherever we go,"WE ARE BEING WATCHED!"
When I was finally seen, I was X-rayed by the same type of machine that was used at the Senior Dental center to take my X-rays, which means that my insurance company and Med-Cal may be double billed for the same set of X-rays ( The first set of Xrays should have been given to Dr. Podstreleny and this would have saved me a long wait.).
The tooth extraction process was another dismal process and it isn't worth talking about. It's over and so is that story. I need some rest!<//Text>

Had a appointment today to review my consultation early in the morning when I check in they didn't have me on their list, they said I made an appointment with them on August. I told them I made the call from that first week of the
month and made it on today. they don't know of the person I talked to on the phone and told me the doctor doesn't do consultations in the morning only the afternoon. The girl on the phone didn't mention it this earlier, with this confirmation their staff is clueless and unhelpful. They wasted my time and tried to move me on a later month in November in the afternoon, I couldn't take it. There's a reason why this place have some bad reviews and why they have a bad rep.< /Text>

I can't believe that a clinic in US could cheat at this level.

I was referred to this Clinic by La Maestra clinic on University Ave for my tooth extraction. I called them up to explain the situation and they quickly pulled my X-Rays from La-Maestra Clinic. Upon asking how much would it cost, they mentioned that unless I visit the clinic and doctor has a look, they can't say anything.

Upon visiting, doctor did not even look at my tooth but just based on the X-Rays suggested that it needs to be pulled out (which I already knew).
To my surprise, I was quoted $985 bill for the extraction, out of which I'll have to pay $457. This was by far the highest quote I had received as I had consulted two other DMD level dentists. I declined the treatment.

Then they asked me to pay $71 fee for consultation. When I asked why should I pay consultation when doctor did not look at my tooth and you only asked me to visit to get the quote? They did not have a convincing answer but in the garb of consultation fee the billing lady persisted. I felt cheated but paid the fee. It looked like a nexus between La-Maestra clinic and this clinic.

If this was not enough, 10 days later, I found that they also charged my Insurance company the same consultation fee of $71. I'm shocked to see that. Why in the first place would they charge me if Insurance could have paid that? And if I had already paid, why would they submit it to Insurance company?

I'm going to file a complaint against the clinic.<//text>

<review>HORRIBLE! The wait is outrageous! They seriously over book to where there is no place to sit in their tiny waiting room. I had a 1pm surgery appt and had been waiting more then 2 hours and they still couldn't tell me how much longer I had to wait. This is the worst run clinic I have ever had the misfortune to step foot in!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This is the best laundromat I've ever been to! I'm from out of town, Washington, so I do not know any others from around here. Compared to the ones back home, this one is amazing.</review>

< Review>
Went here because our local laundry was closed for Easter. This place was dirty! Trash was overflowing and the floor looked like it hadn't been swept in years. The way things are set up, you're always bumping into someone. It was relatively cheap and we got out laundry done but we will only becoming here for emergencies.</Review>

<text>I had a ton of laundry to do and wanted to get it done all at once and found this laundromat off a Google search. I got out first to check it out and found it to be large and clean with newer machines. Some of the machines were huge enough to fit a large area rug I have. Also you don’t need coins here, instead you purchase a card a swipe all your charges. The attendant was nice and informative when I asked her how to operate the machines. This place got 5 stars because the attendant was friendly even though I was interrupting her from another task. Unlike so many other places she was pleasant and didn’t give me any attitude. There were plenty of counter space for me to fold my things and a sitting area that was COVID compliant. As far as doing your laundry goes this was a very positive experience.< /text>< resp>

<text>I visited this place a second time and was very disappointed.  I brought my bags and left them near the washing machine to exchange money.  I inserted the money into the device, but it returned them.  At that moment, an employee came up to me and asked what I was doing here.  I replied that I was washing.  Then the employee asked to show my clothes.  I said good as soon as exchanging money.  The employee didn’t say very politely that I would immediately show my clothes.  Seriously?  I understand that everywhere people are concerned that the problem is with the virus.  I was wearing a mask and gloves and did not look like a homeless person, but I do not understand why such a negative attitude towards my person.  When I showed my clothes, the employee did not even apologize.  In this difficult time, when people are left without work, the business must value its customers.  I wanted to leave and never come here again, but I did not want to carry my heavy load once into the car again.  I stayed, and this employee all my stay tried to find any reason to hook me.  I am very unhappy with this.  I do not recommend this place to visit.

Я посетил это место второй раз и остался очень огорчен. Я принес свои сумки и оставил их возле стиральной машины, чтобы разменять деньги. Я вставил деньги в аппарат , но  оно вернул их. В этот момент сотрудник подошёл ко мне и спросил, что я тут делаю. Я ответил, что стираю. Тогда сотрудник попросил показать мою одежду. Я сказал, хорошо, как только разменять деньги. Сотрудник не очень вежливо сказал что бы я сейчас же показал мои одежду. Серьезно? Я понимаю что везде люди обеспокоены тем, что проблема с вирусом. Я был в маске и перчатках и не выглядел, как бездомный, но мне не понятно, почему к моей персоне было такое негативное отношение. Когда я показал мою одежду, сотрудник даже не извенился. В это трудное время, когда люди остаются без работы, бизнес должен ценить своих клиентов. Я хотел уйти и больше никогда сюда не приходить, но я не хотел нести мою тяжёлую однжду  в автомобиль снова. Я остался, а этот сотрудник все мое прибывание пытался найти любой повод зацепить меня. Я очень недоволен этим. Я не рекомендую это место для посещения< /text>< Pics>

Super clean and efficient washers and dryers. Open 24 HRS, and available parking in front. Many different sized washers and large dryers, perfect for bringing comforters and bedclothes. Coin only, but very affordable.
Attendants and owners are very friendly, and constantly cleaning and doing maintenance. Have been coming here for a few years now.< /review>

Charge $.25 to use the restroom but they refuse to supply you with soap to wash your hands. Owner talked to me and said he refuses to supply soap. Disgusting and dirty. Who knows what kind of germs there are here.</text>

All machines - washers and driers - are working properly and constantly maintained. Sometimes it does not receive coins, but the staff working 24 hours there always takes care of it immediately. Most staffs are welcoming and kindly treating customers. It gets crowded in the evening. After 10 pm, it is mostly not crowded. Washing machines are from $2 to $3.50. You can always add a washing cycle for $0.25 or $0.50. This area gets a little bit sketchy after 11 pm.</text>

Crowded and cramped. I felt claustrophobic in there. But ultimately what made me leave without washing my clothes was they had a very limited selection of laundry detergent available in the vending machine and all of it was off-brand.</review>

< review>
A loyal customer. Last few times I’ve been coming here noticed that washing and drying price went up no biggie I get it. But what took 25 cents to dry before now 5 quarters is over the top. I told the owner who was in house that day. Politely FYI your dyers are not drying like they use to. He was the rudest person ever, in front of my 7 year old he started to scream at me calling me a trouble maker and banned me told me not to come coming back.  Speaking to other ppl around me in Korean making a huge fuss of it. He didn’t believe me, he was calling me a names. I told him my son’s jeans were still really damp he refused to touch it and it was easier to dismiss me like garbage.  I will never come back here and spend my hard earn money here. Respect the ppl in the neighborhood your business is in!! RESPECT PPL PERIOD!!</review>

< Review>
Bad customer service.
Machine took my money and they automatically assumed that I was lying and that I was trying to wash my clothes for free. SMH... In fact, didn't even get the chance to ask if I could get my money back.<//Review>

Machine are my quarters and attendant was no where to be found. After I found him I approached him about the problem and he made it seem like it was my fault for not knowing that one of the machines needs to be smacked a couple times for it to work after I had already put my clothes in a new dryer since he was no where to be found. His response was "talk to the owner". Hispanic man at night, terrible terrible guy. Looks dirty and is a mean character.<//Review>

Wish I could give a half star instead of a one star... the worker here is horrible. I tried to use their dryer but this worker stopped me and told me to leave...somehow... Never going to this place again. Also some of the washers were flooded and didn’t look clean..</text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>It's considered a good day if we're able to do our laundry without one of our machines breaking down mid-wash.

Today was definitely not one of those days.
1/20/2019: I counted at least 25 W/D machines already out of service, and 1 of the 2 sinks out of use. It's a typical busy Sunday morning, so it really doesn't help the situation.

We go ahead and complain to one of the service workers about our washer. It clearly didn't complete the last cycle (rinse) since our clothes were DRENCHED. She looked at the machine, insisted we sign our name/problem/$ spent on a paper, and she'd return our $2 later.

We were already folding our clothes once the owner came around. My dad followed up with the problem and the owner insisted that the machine works (since others were using it, unbeknownst to them that it probably wasn't rinsing their clothes--again it's a busy day so for some they just wanna wash and go).

We call over the lady who helped us initially and it's like she had the 'Bird Box' blindfold on. "We showed you the machine, you witnessed the issue and had us sign a paper, right? What was the point of signing that paper then if you're not gonna do anything anyway?" The owner starts yelling at us saying we always complain... but how can we not if none of their sh*t works?!

Ultimately we weren't going to cry over TWO dollars. It's unbelievable that the owner doesn't care about customer service and will never return our money even if it was just a QUARTER CENT loss.  Greedy motherf*ckr.

He cussed us out and we gladly will not return here again. I already set my eyes on another better laundromat nearby.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Christmas eve I went to wash. I had asked for bill change and the young gentleman that was hiding inside the room questioned me on how much I was going to need. I told him I had a lot to wash and what difference it was going to make. He said it's a holiday and that I had to understand. I was getting annoyed and I told him if he was going to give me the change or not. He got annoyed and gave me the change. Now being that it is a holiday and you know that it may get busy, you need to plan ahead. Don't question a customer that is giving you business.<//Text>< pics>

Not too different from most laundry, but it feels like this place washes well than others I've been to. My only complaint would be the space; during busy hours, parking can be stressful and it can get quite cramped with people with narrow aisles. Other than those slight inconveniences, I consider this place the go-to for my laundry needs.</Text>

Decent 24 hour coin laundry with lots of washing machines, dryers, drying tables, vending machines for chocolate bars, snacks, juices, sports drinjs, laundry soaps, fabric softeners, coin changers. This is relatively clean laundry mat with adequate parking space and well lit. It has a restroom and an attendant who can help you with simple problems with washing machines, dryers, etc.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It seems that it has been about 7 years since I went to the nano laundromat here...
While doing the laundry that had been collected for several days, I am confident that it will bring me a moment to enjoy the momentary tranquility and relaxation that I have been passing by taking advantage of my lack of time.
I was enjoying the internet and opening the warm laundry from the dryer, which was not short, but it felt cold because of the chilly loneliness of Los Angeles. I already buried my forehead in the running laundry!!!!

It's on Western Road, but the wind is very cool, is it cool elsewhere?...

이곳 나노 빨래방을 왕래한지가 약7년정도된듯한데...
며칠간의 모아놨 던 빨래를 하면서 그동안의 시간적 여유가 없음을 팡계 삼아 지나쳐왔던 잠시의 한가로움과여유로움을 만끽할수 있는 여유를 가져다 줌을 자신한다.
인터넷을 즐기고 있다가 짧지 만은 아닌 건조기에서 나온 따뜻한빨래를 개고있자니 쌀쌀해져있 던 LA의 외로움과 함께하기에 추위 로 느꼈던 그것은 이미 개져가는 빨래 속에 이마 묻어놨네!!!!

여긴 웨스턴 길에 있지만 바람이 아주 시원하네요.다른곳은 시원한가요?...<//text>

(Translated by Google) When I was doing laundry in a laundromat around here, I was so absurd that I came here to wash the wet laundry in another laundromat.. Generally, the washing machine capacity is not large, so I had to wash it in two places. When I tried to take it out after drying it in two, I saw that my favorite dress at the front of the machine was twisted to see if it was stuck somewhere in the front of the machine, and it was caught in a crack near the door of the dryer, and I couldn't take it out no matter how much I tried to take it out. I heard that the clothes are going to be damaged by pulling them with force, so I couldn’t take them out, and I asked if I would cut them with scissors. I couldn't see any apology or responsibility. I thought it wasn't so big that anyone would see me as a wrong person...

이곳부근빨래방에서 빨래를 하다가 너무 어처구니없는 일을겪게되서 물에젖은 빨래감을 다른빨래방에서 세척하기위해서 여기로 오게되었다..대체적으로 여기는 세탁기용량이 크지않아서 두군데로 나눠빨아야했다.가장큰싸이즈의 건조기두개로 건조를 하고서 꺼내려고 가보니 기계앞부분에서 가장좋아하는 원피스가 어딘가에 걸렸는지 꽈베기를 꼬는것을보고 봤더니 건조기문근처의 파여진 틈에끼었고 아무리꺼내려해도 꺼낼수없었다.직원에게 빼달라했는데 옷에뜯기는소리가 나는데도 힘으로 잡아당겨대길래 옷이망가질것같다고하니까 그럼 꺼낼수없다면서 가위로 자를거냐고 묻길래 어의없어서 사장을 보고싶다니까 내일아침일찍오라고.....옷은 결국 낀체로 놔두고..아무런 사과나 책임의식도 볼수없었다 누가보면 내가 잘못한사람으로 보일만큼 대수롭지않아했었다...</Text>

(Translated by Google) On August 16th, I went to the laundry, but the soap bubbles didn't come out, so I asked the people who worked.
I turned three places in a large washing machine in front of the beverage machine (washing down blankets). It's a house with children, so I bought laundry soap there...

(Translated by Google) Unfriendly. When I first visited and I didn't know well, I asked to buy detergent, but I didn't know why I didn't like it. And if someone asks you, you have to answer. I want to buy a detergent. So I asked how much it is, so I just say the price and look back again. I didn't ask you a question, but I politely asked ... I still don't forget that look. Looking at a person like a cockroach. Then I turn the washing machine and I don't know why I keep staring at people.
When I first visited and pondered whether I made a mistake because I didn't know it, I don't think I made any mistake. It's crazy how you ignore people. I can't forget the look when I look at it. I didn't go to dawn or late at night ... I just didn't like talking. I went to run the washing machine once in the morning, and I just got dirty all day long.

불친절. 처음 방문해서 잘 몰라서 세제 구입하고 싶다고 질문 한번 했는데 무슨 못볼 걸 본 사람처럼 인상 팍팍 찡그리고 궁시렁거리면서 싫어하는 티 왜그렇게 내는지 모르겠음. 그리고 사람이 물어봤으면 대답을 해야지. 세제 구입하고 싶다니깐 무슨 세제하나 딱 꺼내놓고 먼산바라보거 있음. 그래서 얼마냐고 물어보니깐 그제서야 가격 딱 말하고 다시 먼산 바라보고 있음. 건방지게 질문한 것도 아니거 정중하게 질문했드만... 아직도 그 표정이 안잊혀짐. 무슨 바퀴벌레 보듯 사람을 바라봄. 그리고나서 세탁기 돌리는데 아니 왜 계속 사람을 힐긋힐긋 처다보는지 모르겠음.
처음 방문해서 내가 잘 몰라서 실수라도 한건지 곰곰이 생각을 해봐도 내가 무슨 실수를 한 건 아닌 것 같음. 왜이리 사람을 대놓고 무시하는지 이정도면 미친 수준임. 바라볼 때의 그 표정 잊을수가 없음. 새벽시간이나 밤늦게 간것도 아닌데... 그냥 말 거는것 자체가 싫었나봄. 아침에 세탁기 한번 돌리러 갔다가 하루종일 기분만 더럽히고 옴.< /Text>

Popped in here while I was nearby and wow. What an amazing sushi spot. I decided to try the special which was an oyster shot in ponzu sauce and quail egg, it was excellent. I also went for the shrimp tempura sushi with baked lobster on top- divine; and crab meat topped with spicy tuna, albacore and smelt eggs. We also had the edamame with garlic butter. Everything was incredible.< /review>

AMAZING! I ordered take out and was so impressed! Not only the freshest fish but the freshest wasabi and ginger I ever had. Wow the flavor was incredible. Easily top ten for the best sushi around. 🤤 You won’t be disappointed! All the staff are super sweet and staying extra safe too!<//review>

I adore this restaurant! They prepare first-rate meals, their menu is nice, The chief cook in that restaurant is very trained, I love a lot tasting all their dishes. The food is always of high class, the service towards the customers  is efficient. I frequently visit this restaurant and I was never disappointed. Highly recommended.< /text>

<Text>Ordered two rolls through Postmates, an eel avocado roll and a California roll with added roe. The California roll was pricy, the eel roll didn’t have much eel, and both rolls had an unpleasant sour taste. I liked that you could add things to the rolls, like the roe for the Cali roll, but overall was a disappointing meal for $25. Will not be ordering again.<//Text>< Response>

<rate>1<//rate><review>We had a waiter named denis, we specifically asked for no spicy mayo and he put it on our sushi. After we asked can you make a new one without it, he responded very rudely and said that’s what we ordered and refused to make another one and call the police. The police arrived and he was trying to be a victim, saying we were very rude. After we told the police officer what happened he told, he told the guy to make a new one without spicy mayo. The guys said he was offering that but we wouldn’t pay. I recommend you do not have him as a waiter very rude and bad. Not worth the price, I suggest izakaya sushi worth the price and good food.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>We went at 6:12pm on Saturday 3/30. The hostess definitely lost our business. There were two 2-tops outside on the patio. We asked if we could push them together for our party of 3 as our only goal that night was to eat sushi and sit outside. She said that they couldnt do it (which I understand, not a huge deal). The issue was her attitude. We would have gladly sat down inside but the hostess kept have a snarky attitude with us so we left. We went to Saruyi Sushi which is only two blocks away so if you're reading this definitely go there and not here. The food was amazing and the service was great(unlike at this smelly hot hell hole).<//Review><user>114494089514178604341</user><username>Will Cosden<//username>< Resp>

<review>Best sushi in LA hands down . Pricey but worth every penny and now they have the little skewers from chicken to mushroom. Sit at the bar and if you can meet the chefs , great attitude , service oriented and go out of their way to please you. Never had a bad meal in this place . They are in a new and much larger space now. Worth a night out on town to enjoy their Sushi</review>< rate>

Old tuna sushi that smelled bad. We informed our waiter who passed on the info to the owner/chef and the owner kicked us out after he made us pay for the miso soup. I wouldn't recommend this sushi place to anyone because they don't have fresh fish and the worst customer service.<//review>

The sushi is so yummy here.  The only down side is it is always crowded. You should make reservations, but it takes forever for anyone to answer the phone.  Good luck!</Text>

I was in extreme pain and needed to get to a dentist immediately the nerve pain was so bad pain killers didn't even work.    The problem was it was a holiday and nobody was open.   The Dr. came and opened his business for me on a holiday and took good care of me.   I'll never forget that.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>DO NOT COME HERE..
Not only did they NOT cover my gums completely with the blue gel to protect my gums,  they forgot about me TWICE..

There are two 15 minute sessions with the bleach on. The first time she left it on for an extra 5 mins. I didn't really mind the extra 5 minutes. But then she left me sitting there for over 30 minutes the second session! Thats over TWICE as much as it should have been on my teeth.

I was in pain still from the first session because she didn't completely cover my gums and instead of rinsing my gums off she simply whipped it and put on more of the protectant over the area. Even when I told her it was still burning all she had to say was " well its not on your gums anymore"

I had to get up and find someone to go get her to take the bleach off. She didn't show me my teeth and tried to get me out of there very fast which I thought was strange and so when I checked my teeth, a large portion of my gums were completely white.

My teeth themselves had terrible sensitivity and shooting pains with the slightest change in temperature. I couldn't eat or drink anything. My gums had been so severely burned from the bleach the flesh started to deteriorate and come off and bleed any time my tooth brush lightly touched them and even if i touched them with my tongue.

I left there in tears and they have not reached out to me or offered my money back or anything for that matter. I made it clear I was in pain and extremely upset. I will now be contacting a business law attorney.

I will attach pictures... Edit: for some reason you have to click on my review and select photos to see the pictures I’ve attached of my gums.

Just Go somewhere else!!< /Text>< pictures>

Going to the dentist has never an easy experience for me.  I’ve had some bad experiences with dentist in my past. I have to say the vibe in this office is so calming.  Dr Tibbitts is gentle and a perfectionist.  His office was able to accommodate me quickly and my end result was amazing.  He does excellent  work.  He listened to my concerns and put me at ease.  He is definitely my new dentist.  I feel lucky to have found this dental office.<//text>

It was our first time at Tibbitts and Associates. Dr Tibbitts and his staff took a great care of my wife and I ,and our two year girl. They did a great job. Also offered treatment plans custom to our needs.
Thorough, patient, knowledgeable and professional environment. Super easy to work with and affordable. Highly recommend them to anyone.</review>

I never thought I’d say this about a Dentist,
But I had a wonderful experience!!! The office staff was great trying to get my insurance figured out, calling me back immediately several times. Got an appointment very quickly, even though they had never seen me before, I asked for a more private room which they gave me. The office was cold and offered me a blanket(which I thankfully took😂) If your nervous about going to the dentist I highly recommend them!!!!!< /review>

Dr. Tibbitts has exceptionally good employees as they are kind, effective and Timely. I just had my wife there today and they removed her tooth immediately and she feels much better. I also had emergency stitches done here a few years ago and I was in and out. Go here if you need teeth removed or if you need teeth replacements, they also offer implants that are titanium. Care credit is an option as well. 12 months interest-free is how Care Credit works.<//review>

<review>Another great visit to Dr. Tibbitts office.  Jessica did a fantastic job cleaning my teeth.  She is very detailed and takes her time.  From my experience all the hygienists there are all amazing and thorough at what they do.  Dr.  Bramwell did a great job as well.  The whole office makes our family feel so welcome. 6 years and counting.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I travel quite far, passing many other dental offices on the way, for the unmatched services of Dr. Tibbitts and his staff. The office is clean and accommodating. The staff are inviting, informative, and efficient. Dr. Tibbitts and his associates are always willing to spend plenty of time with me to answer my questions and ensure that I am comfortable with the necessary procedures to make certain my teeth last as long as I do. As much as you can enjoy going to the Dentist, I enjoy going to this one!< /text>

Great experience.  Front desk greeted my husband and me immediately and she was very pleasant.  Dr Bramwell was our dentist.  He is very personable and did not rush through our introduction to the practice.  We felt very comfortable with our hygienists.  They were friendly and thorough.  We left satisfied that we had found a good dental office.</Review>

This review is for Dee Gomez. Dee is the Director of Dental Operations and she works for Dr. Tibbitts’ all dental offices, including Legacy Dental in Temecula, Marietta and Alta Vista. That’s the ones that I know of.
Dee and I met under circumstances that left me without a dentist and a job 1/3 done. Knowing what happened, she contacted me and offered to help any way possible and acceptable  for me, since I live in Palm Springs.
She was instrumental in providing for me the best dental care possible as long as I agree to drive to Murrieta. I agreed.
Dee is the most passionate human being, her compassion and willingness to help me has no limits.  She loves her job, takes pride in it and nothing is difficult for her.  Her help is very valuable!  She is just awesome!
I am 74 years old and yet to meet anyone who comes even close to her!
Dee, thank you from the bottom of my heart!<//text>

I had just been to the ER the night before for a broken tooth with severe tooth pain. They got me in early the next morning. Andrew and his staff did everything to make you feel comfortable. They really took the effort to get to know you and not force unnecessary procedures and expenses on you. I have never met two dentists that genuinely care about their patients needs, while maintaining their high standards of work. Spencer preformed each procedure professionally and communicated every step and checked with you to make sure there was no pain. Hands down these are the guys to go to for all your dental needs. Thank you to the staff as well.</Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< pictures>

One suggestion for Zoom teeth whitening is to ask about getting the whitening trays beforehand. I would have upgraded the experience if I had known. Otherwise wonderful experience I'll be back!< /text><username>Tiara Byrd<//username>< resp>

The office is clean, welcoming, modern, and they even have a fun room that my kids absolutely loved! Dr Todd and Dr Jeff are exceptional! They showed us around the beautiful office and my kids were taken care of by extremely well trained staff that are friendly and efficient. I was invited in for the check up and the Doctors are fantastic! They had great upbeat music playing and water in the lounge with lots of reading choices while I relaxed. The office has state of the art equipment and the dental chairs looked plush clean and even welcoming.

Dr. Tibbits's office never disappoints, which is the reason our family has been going there for over a decade.  Every single person in this office performs their duties with professionalism and they take pride in their work.  I always feel they really care.  I have consistently referred people to this office and those same individuals have thanked me because their experiences have been equally satisfying.  I definitely recommend this office.< /review>

I've been coming to this dentist regularly for the last 6 years. To date, I have had a dental implant, root canal, 2 crowns and various fillings and every procedure went smooth. Over the last 2-3 years my oral health has improved to the point that I only come in for cleanings because they've been able to put a stop to any decay, but the dentist always goes out of his way to find me and chat for a bit. I have referred several friends and family members who have all become regular patients and have thanked me for the recommendation.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I've been to a lot of dentists, and this is THE best dentist I've ever been to! Sunday I broke a piece off my molar. Somehow Monday morning they fit me in. I could tell they were very busy as I think I overheard they had a few emergencies (besides myself) come in that morning in addition to their regular appointments, but their staff was so professional and competent that they still took us all in like clock work. In fact, despite all the emergencies, my wait time was actually less than almost any other dentist office I've visited. I was additionally highly impressed by the kindness of each of the staff members, let alone the knowledge and skill of the the dentists that worked on me. Dr. Tibbitts was amazing. He inspected my tooth, immediately knew and explained the best solution, and they got right on it. And I have to say, unfortunately I've had a lot of tooth work done and the shots still freak me out, but the woman who did my numbing shots at Dr. Tibbitts' provided the most gentle, pain-free experience I have EVER had with dental shots. I was incredibly impressed and grateful. I don't ever want to go anywhere else. I can't recommend this dental office highly enough.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I’ve been looking for a new family dentist for awhile and just happened to see a Groupon offer for this office. I am an admitted scaredy-cat when it comes to going to the dentist but I felt so well taken care of here.
They definitely have a goal to provide great customer service! It is obvious that everyone in their office has been well trained to deliver a truly comfortable and informative experience for their patients.  The office and communication is run so efficiently, another trait I really admire!  My first visit was for a cleaning, exam and whitening and each person I met with was wonderful.  I was so impressed that I will be returning for a more in-depth procedure as well as bringing my family in for their dental needs.</Text>

They are extremely thorough and professional, handling routine exams for me, my wife, and our four children.  They recognize individual patients needs, fears, and concerns and are able to distinctly articulate the best options for each us.  They show patience dealing with with children that are sometimes hysterical, and other times need additional instruction on preventative home care.  When considering dental health care, If you have a problem, they will solve it, professionally, efficiently, and using cutting edge technology to evolve it.

We only trust Dr. Tibbitts and his staff with our family's dental needs.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Time>1546475061435< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>So how did I start my New Year you ask?.
By having to have a ROOT CANAL! Yes, the dreaded avoid at all cost procedure
Dr. Tibbitts and staff made the visit a breeze!
Just a pinch when injected and that's it. No pain.  Wore my earbuds, relaxed and wallah.

My entire family goes to them and everyone is always pleased with the outcomes....from cleanings to wisdom teeth extracted.

Highly recommend</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Very thorough. Perfect bedside manner. I'm new to California and needed to find a new dental clinic. These guys got me in the day after I called. Experience was top notch. So much in fact that I opted to bring my daughter in the next day. She was a little apprehensive as most children are on their first visit to a new dentist but she quickly fell at ease. Im pretty easy but if you make my daughter comfortable and happy you've done your job. Five Stars. 👍🏼<//Review>

AWESOME dentist. I had not been to the dentist in 10 years before coming here and what a great experience I'm so glad I chose this office. Everyone made me feel so at ease and so comfortable and I did not feel pressured to get any unnecessary dental work. The office was clean and modern and the staff was friendly I definitely recommend going here.</Text>

I have not been to the Dentist for 10+years I had a tooth ache and my husband referred me to Dr.Tibbitts and I was very afraid very afraid, because of past bad experiences with Dentist. I went and from the time I entered the door to the back office they made me feel comfortable and not scared to make a long story short the Dr pulled my tooth and I kid you not I felt nothing could not believe when he said he was done. I thank you Dr.Tibbitt and staff for your wonderful bed side manners and making me feel comfortable and trusting a Dentist again.😍😍😍😍< /Text>

<Text>Tibbitts and staff are fast and friendly dental professionals who run a clean and quiet office. I would recommend these dentists and their hygienists to anyone who is looking.

I just moved to Temecula and didn't have a Dentist yet. I lost a crown and Dr Tibbitts was able to get me in right away and I was in and out. He had a very nice office with a friendly staff. I would recommend Dr Tibbitts to anyone that wants to upgrade their Dentist.</Review>

Thank you to Dr. Tibbitts and his dental team. When I first met them they were the most accommodating group of people I have ever met from the receptionist to the back technicians. Not knowing what I was going to do being faced with having to wear dentures at my age, Dr. Tibbitts and his team they reassured me that it would be a very  easy transition and I would be happy with the end results. I can only say that I have not completed my dental procedure as of this date,  however my experience so far as been great. If I have to rate I would definitely give Dr. Tibbitts and his team a 5 star rating. Thanks for the experience.< /review>

Also had another daughter visiting from Colorado needed a root canal on a limited time schedule, they made it happen all while giving us the best service and experience we could ever ask for, my daughter used to be afraid of the dentist and now she said she wont go anywhere else, thank you everyone at tibbetts office you were a lifesaver</text>< pics>

<text>"I just finished cosmetic dental treatment and I am very pleased.  Dr. Tibbitts designed my smile with his lab and I approved the process.  There were some changes that I wanted to make after the first set of crowns came back.  Dr. Tibbitts agreed with me and was very helpful.  It was nice to know that he wouldn't accept the work unless it was perfect.  The staff were very helpful and even the lab was very good.  I was able to visit the lab for some customization.  I am now extremely satisfied with my new smile and get compliments often.< /text>< Response>

I avoid the Dentist/Ortho in general, but the team at Andrew Tibbits DDS office were fast, friendly, and I did not get any sales pitch.  I usually do not like dealing with the dentist visits, cleanings, etc, but I think I now have my preferred office for dental work.</review>

<Review>I haven't been to see a Dentist longer than I'm willing to admit, but for being a dental office, it was overall a good experience.  I went originally due to a root canal and crown that I had done some time ago and is now causing me a lot of pain.  They had to refer me to another Dentist, which meant I was still going to be in pain for another day.  I had also scheduled a teeth cleaning.  I was a bit concerned because it had been awhile since I've had them professionally cleaned.  She was so gentle and did an excellent job.  It was the best cleaning I've ever had done.  Because of the way I was treated, I would not hesitate to go back again.</Review></record>

<Text>I travel from out of state to see Dr. Bramwell. He’s the best dentist I’ve ever been to, and trust me, as a senior citizen, I’ve been to plenty! He is kind and takes his time explaining everything. Luckily, I have family close by, so I can always have a good excuse to come here...but even if there were no family, I’d still make the trip. Maybe not the least expensive treatment ever, but since ‘you get what you pay for’, I always feel justified. Dr. Bramwell just makes me smile, every time I see him...  and although it may not be cool to say.. he AND Dr. Tibbitts are..  are... easy on the eyes!!</Text><resp>None<//resp><UserId.>115628557574820524857<//UserId.>< Name>

Dr. Tibbitts is very personable and friendly--I think this is what makes him such a great dentist.  If you're looking for a dentist that doesn't intimidate you and makes you feel welcome, go and see Dr. Tibbitts.  He does great work and the office is beautiful.<//review>

I’m leaving this review even though my sons account pulled up,. Myself, husband and three teens started coming to DR Tibbits office
About 5 years ago.
Best dentist we’ve ever had! Hands-down. For so many reasons you have to find out for yourself :-) and Abigail doesn’t mean cleaning but in the nicest of ways :-) great job all of you thank you sincerely The Daga family</review>

We gave a few dentists in our area a try and were not very impressed. We heard about Dr Tibbitts from a friend and she said he was worth the longer drive for him. His office staff is extremely friendly and helpful with our insurance questions. Valerie (I think) called our insurance for us when we had questions regarding our much needed dental work. Dr Tibbitts is extremely patient, kind and gentle! He was even able to give me a crown AT THE APPT. It's nice to get that done without having to make a trip back with a temporary crown! My husband and I were very impressed! I love this office and will definitely be making the longer drive to our new dentist! It's such a relief to finally find another dentist that I can bring my family too and feel just as comfortable as we were before. Perhaps it was meant to be. Thank you Dr Tibbitts! See you soon for some cosmetic work! I really am looking forward to it!!<//review>< gmap_id>

Went in without appointment for a simple denture repair and next I knew I was in the chair getting ready for what I've needed to be done for a long time including new anchors for my implants. I was impressed with their effort to do an excellent job, not juse a good one< /Text>

Dr Tibbits and his staff were wonderful. Their state of the art facility is immaculate and very convenient. The friendly and professional care Dr Tibbits showed me made me feel very confident in his ability to help me with my implant consultation. Thank you!!!< /text>

<review>I had called to make 2 new patient appointments early on a Thursday. The lady said she'd verify my insurance, call me back & once that was done she'd be able to get my husband & I appointments the up coming week. Thursday went by, Friday passed, and here we are late Wednesday night...
I actually called today (Wednesday) @2pm. Another lady took my name & number & said the 1st lady was at lunch & would be back shortly. She told me to expect a call from lady #1 within 15 minutes. No one ever called me back. There's no follow through. I doubt the dentist knows that he is loosing business. I also doubt that any one is being held accountable for follow-ups.   Obviously they do not want our business. We will be taking our business elsewhere! We feel we shouldn't have to continue to peruse them, besides we have great insurance so it wouldn't have taken her long to verify it. Especially if I had just taken our kids to the peds dentist last week. Ridiculous!!! -5⭐️👎🏼<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Dr Andy came in on a Sunday morning for an emergency root canal.  Nothing fun about it but my experience was very positive.He was able to diagnose the problem and provided me with much needed pain relief. Thank you for your great service!</Text>

Going to the dentist is never fun. Especially as an adult. But if you do need to go see one, run to Dr. Tibbitt’s office. He and Dr. Bramwell are fun and make the visit pleasant. The office staff is efficient and take great care of you. I highly recommend everyone to come to this office.< /review>

<text>If you want a dentist you can not only trust but rely on completely....Dr Spencer Bramwell is beyond compare. He was my dentist in Arizona and had made a bridge for me that was awesome, only problem was that the temporary cement was not allowing for the bridge to be taken out and permanently cemented. Dr Bramwell said that he would re-cement it if and when it came out. Well, two years later when I called the office Dr Bramell was no longer there. He had sold the office and moved to California. Oh dear!! So I found him in Murrieta California and made an appointment. He was the only dentist that I felt comfortable with. Dr Bramwell is not only true to his word, but he understood my situation and once again fixed my problem and discounted my treatment. I recommend Dr Spencer Bramwell to anyone and everyone who may be afraid or apprehensive of going to a dentist. He is the best of the best.
Thank you Dr Bramwell  If your name was spelled incorrectly, I apologize , it was auto corrected.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I don't like going to the Dentist.  I've had my share of bad experiences. I was very reluctant to go.  I reviewed a lot of Dentists in the Temecula Valley. I got very discouraged.  So I decided to patronize Dr. Tibbitts office.  I was greeted with a smile and a very helpful staff.  In no time I was seen and placed in a chair in the caring hands of there hygienist. The cleaning and the X ray went very well.  I was very spoiled with there 5 STAR treatment.  Dr. Tibbitts came in and evaluated my teeth corrected my bight explained everything as if I was his student. I came in nervous I walked confident knowing I would be back with my family because Dr. Tibbitts is the right choice as our family dentist. I would highly recommend him to my friends and family.  Keep up the good work and thank you for making my experience at the dentist, a good one.

<text>Let me preface this by saying it’ll be long. So, upon the recommendation of some co-workers, and a quick review of Yelp, and Google I decided to call Dr. Tibbits office for an appointment. I haven’t been to a dentist in about two years, and my current/ soon to be ex-dentist NEVER has any openings. Any who, I started having some random tooth pain, and of course my dentist couldn’t get me in until September…seriously. Hung up on them and called Dr. Tibbits office and they said they could get me in the very next day! That didn’t work because of adult life, aka work, so I made my appointment for Friday the 10th. However, my wife woke up this morning….the 9th with super bad tooth pain due to a long overdue wisdom tooth that needed to be extracted. It was so bad I told her to call Dr. Tibbits and try to get an appointment, now mind you this is before I even had my appointment. She called, and they had her in the office within three hours, and now let the praise begin. She said that Dr. Tibbits and his team were the nicest, and most professional dental practitioners she has ever encountered.  Along with their awesome patient service, Dr. Tibbits was able to extract that tooth the very same day during the appointment time. My wife didn’t have to leave, or wait or anything.  That to me already makes me a patient here for life. Thank you so much Dr. Tibbits and your team for taking care of my wife, your excellent patient service really does stand out, and I will spread the word to everyone I know to come to your practice. Now I still haven’t even had my appointment since it is tomorrow, but I am actually looking forward to it. That’s crazy if you ask me because who looks forward to medical or dental appointments lol? A giant thank you again though to you and your team Dr. Tibbits, and one more thank you for answering all of my mother’s questions who accompanied my wife. I look forward to meeting you and your team.<//text>< user_id>

<text>Very happy with this dentist office. They are honest and a very good dentist office. I have had my daughter there a few times and she has never complained. I tried taking her to another dentist. She didn't like it there and wanted to come back to Tibbetts.
Today, I went there to get cavities filled and had the best experience, both the dentist Todd and Maureen did excellent work and made me feel comfortable.
I actually told them I could not believe how happy I was with the way I was being treated, and their service. The front office is very friendly and helpful.   I recommend this office for adults and children. They have a cool children's playroom while you wait.   However, you do need a PPO, but it will be worth it. You will end up actually going to the dentist instead of avoiding it.  They also sometimes offer Groupon's which is how I discovered them, I came in for a cleaning and I was more than impressed. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed.</text>< Pictures>

<text>As a physician, patient care is of utmost importance to me. I felt that dr Tibbets was very caring throughout my experience. I called him later in the day on a Friday and he was finishing up in the office but told me to come over as I had a problem. He saw me and did surgery right away so I wouldn't have a problem on the weekend. That is the definition of caring. I know a lot of dentists who would say they would see me after the weekend for their own convenience. Thank you dr Tibbets.< /text>< GmapID>

<Time>1497083283060< /Time><Rate>3< /Rate><text>The dentist and hygienist were great! Very friendly.  Had issues with my insurance though.  I called an hour before my appointment to get an email address to send my x rays to. When I called that's when they tell me that they couldn't verify my insurance.  I said,  well I have it so can you try again? I said in the mean time I'll call the insurance on my end too just to make sure everything was ok.  So,  now I'm driving to my appointment while trying to verify my own insurance which took forever and caused me a bit of stress . I was told I'm ok so I called them back and told them and they say,  oh yeah,  we got it too.... really? And you couldn't call me back to tell me that? So,  I go in and get seen.  Since I already had x rays done I was told they would still take them,  but at no charge to me.  Great! A couple of weeks later I get a bill for over $100. I have NEVER received a bill from a dentist for a Full exam,  prophy and xrays. I called and they said,  oh, you're out of network.  I asked them,  isn't that why you're supposed to verify and inform your patient of this BEFORE the appointment? It's the right thing to do.  She said they do and I would have been told.... yeah no.  Remember,  I had to verify my own insurance??? Anyways,  they charged me for the x rays as well,  but removed those charges.   Lady i spoke to could have cared less about it all.  She was like a robot on repeat.  I still owe them so I'm a bit annoyed about that but what can you do? And yes,  my treatment prices were outrages for me,  but then again I'm out out network so I guess they would be!<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>
{'time': 1497105313083, 'text': "Stephanie,\n\nI'm sorry about the insurance and billing issue.  I will make sure your account is corrected and has a zero balance.  You won't owe anything.  You absolutely should have been informed beforehand if there was going to be any out of pocket cost etc.  Ignore the statement you received.  If there's anything else please feel free to call me.

Back when I lived in Cali, I went to Dr Tibbits following a nasty bike accident that left me with a missing tooth. Friends and colleagues are always surprised when I tell them I have a dental implant, which speaks volumes for how natural it looks. Dr Tibbits & staff did a great job!< /review>

<text>I had to get a couple of teeth removed or extracted.  I am a very nervous type.  I had a bad experience when I was a child and I asked around and more than one friend recommended this office.  I saw Dr. Seewel and he was very caring and nice.  I have a dental insurance plan and it was valerie who helped explain the details of it.  I forget who was my assistant but she was really good too.  I hate trying to find an honest mechanic, dentist, doctor etc.  I checked yelp, angie's list and other review sites and I found them to all consistently say good things about Dr Tibbits and his office staff.  I don't usually leave reviews but I am going to start leaving reviews.  I live near French Valley and so the location is good.  From walking in the first time I was offered water and a neck pillow.  Digital screens everywhere and great service.  I waited less than 15 minutes in the waiting room and I have no complaints.  As far as the procedure, I don't remember too much but my recovery was pretty good.  It hurt for a couple days and then it started to get better.  I am glad it is over with.  It could have been much worse.< /text>< GmapID>

<review>Dr. Tibbit is nothing short of amazing!  Everything about the experience there was incredible- from the professional staff, short wait time, to the handling of my procedure itself, I was unexpectedly delighted (it's not too often you can say that about going to the dentist!).

Dr. Tibbit was recommended by a friend as the cosmetic dentist of choice in my area. I opted for the Lumineer veneers: having grown up with a less-than-stellar smile, I'm furious with myself for having waited so long to get this done.   They took their time explaining the procedure and going through all the details I needed to know before committing.  The procedure itself was painless and went flawlessly.  I've been "paying it forward" and recommending Dr. Tibbit to anyone and everyone interested in cosmetic dental procedures- I'm forever grateful to my friend for having recommended him to me!< /review>< pics>

Let me start by saying that I love the hygienists and the doctors here, especially Sally, my children really are excited to go to the dentist and see her. I agree with having trouble with the front desk staff in the past over insurance billings and procedures too. Most recently with the change in my insurance. I was notified that Tricare was switching to Metlife and didn't think to double check that the office was still a preferred practice which was my mistake. But I would have hoped that they would have notified me (and really all military customers) before doing cleanings on me and my children that I will now have to pay a partial payment.  Something that was usually and expected to be 100% covered until I got a surprise $113 bill in the mail. After calling and discussing the issue with them they agreed to split the bill in half.  I went in today to pick up our x-rays (and pay my unanticipated bill) and asked if they sent out a letter or anything to let Tricare customers know that they were no longer a preferred practice and they said no, that when a Tricare patient comes in they tell them then. Well they didn't tell me, or the other woman in the waiting room because it was a surprise for her too! It came off as sneaky and I really didn't appreciate it after being a customer for nearly 2 years.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I must say I picked this dentist because of the positive reviews. Yes, Dr. A Tibbitt is fabulous, but the front desk treated me terrible. Granted, they seem so very nice innitially, but then Valerie charged my insurance for Xrays I did not receive. When I called to point this out, she told me she would take care of it, but she did not. I received a statement few weeks later, where it was NOT corrected and called my Insurance to have them take a note of it.  My daughter has an insurance via her dad, and I was send a bill from Tibbits office  that my Insurance did not cover her treatment. Ofcourse not! I called and spoke to Valerie, again and pointed out they filed under the wrong insurance, she is under her dads, my ex, and not my insurance. Her response, and I quote:" We don't get in the middle of divorces, that is your problem" WHAT????  What does that have to do with the mistakes  SHE made, and I needed them to correct it. I think the fact I check all my statements and noticed they overcharged my insurance as well as my daughters for Xrays we DID NOT receive. Valerie was out of line, and she knows it, not even an apology when I called and asked for my paperwork, because I am certainly NOT coming back.<//text>

Way too expensive< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1501425944573, 'text': "Cynthia, I totally understand your comment.  Dentistry has become very expensive and mostly because of all the technology, office overhead and materials.  I know there are offices that are cheaper and many that are more expensive than mine.  I invest in CT scanners, Cerec 3D crown milling units, implants and more.  If there's something I can do for you and your family please let me know.   Sincerely, Andy Tibbitts"}</Resp>< GmapID>

Love this place, excellent customer service there are usually 2 older lady serving my family.  Been here a few times with my family and food and service has been consistently great.  Can't go wrong with Lobster w/noodles and crab soup.</review>

<name>Crissy Leen</name><Text>What a experience. My Vietnamese friend invited me and I’m so grateful. Is the kind of restaurant you come with your family or a big group of friends and enjoy all authentics. Even this meat soup was so flavorful. I enjoy also ordering the coconut water. I can’t eat spicy and they were able to accommodate my request. But for my friends that love really spicy they enjoy.< /Text><userid>117199205574557045629<//userid></record></dataset><record>

A fantastic place to go with family for the occasional outting. Seafood is fresh and delicious and if you go there, please please please try the Lobster and noodles. The lobster is moist and the noodles are the best I've ever tried. Also recommended the crispy tofu, clams, and soup. Not really traditional Vietnamese food but it's where all the locals go so you know it's amazing.<//Review>

I'm just not keen on the aquarium visible from the place you're eating... Because that's where you pick your.. food.. I mean the animal that you're gonna eat.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Very great seafood. I would not recommend order the lobster noodles to go. It doesn't taste great once you get home. Eat in is much better.<//Review>

The food is good, I think they have a really good cook, but they cheat on the weight of lobster and live fish everytime and that get me mad. I like the food, but I need to call out this kind of dishonesty. I see few other reviews complain about the same thing in Yelp.  They used to be really busy, now many people go to the one on 1st.</review>

<name>Coy Tran<//name><Date>1507354677652</Date><rating>5<//rating><review>We were a bit apprehensive considering the lower rating than the original location, but alas it was of excellent taste! Other than the crab maw soup everything we ordered was delicious! Salt pan fried shrimp were not oily and not too salty. Lobster was very big for 6 lbs medium sized at $17.99/lbs and very tender. Clams in basil sauce were also flavorful. They will accept credit card but highly prefer cash. Less crowded than original location on a Friday evening.</review>< pictures>

Nice place serving not just the regular Vietnamese fare but also specials like the deep fried lobsters in a bed of fried noodles, the deep fried soft tofu which they make so crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. If you are sensitive to MSG this is not your place. We went there for lunch and I was dizzy the rest of the afternoon. Cash preferred, free parking is available.<//Text>

I really loved this place. Went with my family - my folks used to come here in the 70s and they said it looks exactly the same. I can't say the service was great but the food definitely was. 3 of us got the "32 pointer" and it was fantastic. It's got fried shrimp, smelt, catfish, clams, and frog legs with fries. All of it was great washed down with a couple of beers and a well-made old fashioned. I'll be back.< /Review>

<Text>They dont give you the lobster tail! No one in our group ate any lobster tail meat. Only the body and claws. They left the tip of the tail for decoration. Check yelp, they have done this to others.

They also claim to be cash only. Who carries $200 in cash?! After some haggling and suggestions to go to a gas station, they finally took credit card.

Do not eat here.  They are newport tan cang in name only.< /Text>< Resp>

The salt and pepper calamari is absolutely amazing!!! I have gone here numerous times over the past 10 years and it has never disappointed. I've taken family and friends and everyone agrees the calamari is to die for. The lobster dish looks amazing but I haven't had the opportunity to try it here. It's on my list for my next visit for sure.< /Review>

Even after having a full lunch, we drove by this location and said LETS EAT LUNCH AGAIN! Hahah. We could resist giving Newport Seafood a try during our trip here, no matter how full we were. We came here right after a lunch crowd and i'm glad we didnt have to fight with anyone for some lobsters. We ordered ours with garlic noodles and it was the best decision ever. The smallest lobster they had was a 4 pounder- we didn't even make a dent. We ended up taking it to-go and brought it on our flight home LOL. The meat on the lobster is thick and you don't feel skimped for the price you pay- definitely a must try if you visit SoCal.< /text>

good food but horrible service honestly... once there was no one in the diners and they gave us one of the worst table there with not cloth no nothing...... but then people came looking like  they had a lot of money and course they had great service.... i recommend it for the food but its rare for goo service and they just start at you and watch your every move not cool but lame looks like they hate their jobs lies about prices went from 9.99 in person and then in the bill 15.99 wtf right was way better like a few years ago< /review>

<Text>The food is great, but the service is one of the worst around, you get ignored, food dropped  on the floor is ignored, sodas are served straight from the can you have to ask for a cup. If you ask for something you have to do it three times before it's brought to you. You have to get out of the cleaning ladies way or she will run you over. and she leaves the dirty cart next to your tableService is so bad that the good food doesn't make up for it
There is another one up the street at 4411 W first street that I will try next<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I went to San Diego on the way to Los Angeles this summer. The lobster method is very special. It is delicious. The lobster meat is very good because of the fresh super teeth. As for the price, I have no say.

It seems like they have good service. However I was quite upset and genuinely surprised when I have been given a quote for the car I test drove 2000 $ more that was listed on the website. A sales person kept telling me how amazing this price is and lying into my face. I would highly suggest to do you research online first across multiple dealerships in order not to be tricked before coming there.<//review>

Great experience buying a new car here. I ended  up with the car I wanted it. All the staff were very helpful, friendly, and answered all my questions.  Finance paperwork was  explained in detailed, warranty and maintenance plans. Very patient explaining different option and prices. Overall I am very happy with my new car and definitely a very nice buying experience!</Text>

Regardless of them being a dealership with commissioned salesmen, they were very honest and accommodating throughout the entire way. A big thank you as well to Dino, the primary salesman who helped us. He was very helpful throughout our time shopping, and was not pressuring whatsoever with the buying process.

Had great experience dealing with this dealer, bought Elantra SE and got good deal and it was quick.

APR they offered was bit high eventhough I had excellent credit score, becauese I didn't take extended warranty.

overall it was good. t<//Review>

Dropped my son's car off her today for some warranty work   - - may need to update the review after the work is done and/or after the dealer responds.

Dealt with Israel an Advisor in the Service Department who is a breath of fresh air here. We have gone here in the past (not much of a choice of dealers for this type of car as a few local ones have closed up) and this service department has been the haven for tired and not very professional service advisors who love to say no and think the customer is an idiot.

After dealing with Israel this place has a whole new vibe. BTW the waiting areas have been updated and cleaned and look good as well< /review>

We drove quite a ways to find the perfect car and Hyundai of Serramonte made it happen. They gave the price that they advertised, explained everything as it was happening, and did everything they could to get me in the car I came for. Simon was great! Very knowledgeable with fantastic customer service. The managers all came together to help me get the terms I wanted and explained everything that they were seeing so that I could understand. The best place I have ever bought a car from!< /review>

I don’t typically write reviews and I don’t typically praise car dealerships, but my experience with Hyundai Serramonte surprised me in many ways, as the easiest fix to the biggest car trouble I’ve ever had.

Israel was able to petition Hyundai to cover the cost of my engine repair, and also repaired every other recall  concern with the vehicle. During the time that my car was at the service station, Israel arranged for me to get a rental car, which was a breeze, and the cost of which Hyundai covered. The car was fixed and running like new within a month.

Can you believe this service?! Thank you, Israel and the team at Hyundai Serramonte!< /text>

5+ stars to Mark and Jessica. They provided exceptional service and were extremely courteous. They went out of their way to create a positive experience, which ameliorated the fact that I needed to leave my car in repairs for an extended period due to a manufacturer recall. Subsequently, I had positive interactions with George too.

The reason I’m not giving 5 stars overall was the decidedly negative experience I had when I went back to pick up my car. The person who inspected the temporary vehicle (I didn’t catch his name) was borderline rude. He either wasn’t working for Hyundai or didn’t care about customer service, or both. I don’t believe he appreciated the fact that not having your personal vehicle as a result of a manufacturing defect, and the way that encroached on personal schedule, can be stressful.

I hope the dealership makes sure that there’s consistency and continuity of excellent service. There are some great people working there. Again, Mark and Jessica were amazing. Wish everyone had their level of touch and customer orientation.<//Text>

I just moved to this area from Los Angeles and I’m used to my Hyundai down there, but wow the service is great here! Very nice employees and great customer service. I just came in for my routine maintenance and they also washed my car AND vacuumed it! No other dealership has vacuumed my car for me. It was wonderful!< /Text>

My first time having my new Hyundai serviced. Overall, everything was satisfactory. Work was done when promised at a fair price. Staff were friendly enough.  Facility looks a little make-shift with a temporary canopy covering the area where you drive in your car and inside it all looks like a temporary space. You wonder if they’re planning to stay awhile.< /review>

< review>
Long story short they told me that a 110 point check (or whatever they called it) was done on the used car I bought so it didn't need any repairs or maintenance. I took them at their word. I took it to my mechanic and it cost me $497 to repair the windshield wiper, alignment was way off, it need a new starter battery (it's a separate battery used in hybrids) because it was almost dead!, an oil change, and it needed a new cabin air filter (which they said was dangerously clogged and was obviously never changed). Their 110 point inspection (or whatever they call it) is bogus. Oh, and when I was signing the paperwork they added a $497 fee for something. I asked what it was and they said, 'It was already on the car', so in other words they didn't price it into the car until after I was signing the paperwork. I should have walked away but I'm a nice guy and just went along with it because I thought I was getting a decent price and wanted to get out of there. Never again, unless they want to send me a check for the $495 I had to pay my mechanic for repairs they should have done in the first place.

Update: Anthony contacted me via this review (as you can see below) and asked for my contact information. There is no way to respond to his him on this Google review. But you can clearly see my name on this review. So if they really wanted to 'make things right' they would simply look my name up on their computer system (because it's clearly available on this review) and send me $497 (at the very least). But do you think they really want to do that?</review>

Service done very fast. I got back clean car.

<Review>Getting a new car is always exciting. Wasn’t planning to actually buy it (was going to wait till got tax refund). But the salesman (left his card in my other jacket) was able to secure the financing for me and the car I wanted was “in stock”. The whole process went quicker than I thought it would (thought I would need half a day). The salesman and finance manager were very friendly and didn’t pressure me too much. Just pointed out options and left it for me to decide if I wanted the options (or not). Overall, it was a good shopping experience.< /Review>< Response>

We plan to buy a three row SUV. We told the sale that we want a test drive and compare with Toyota highlander and Honda pilot. The sale showed very little interests in showing us the car. He even pushed us to go Toyota and Honda first! We bought our new Pilot just 5mins walk away. I don't know whether Hyundai has a good vehicle because we never have a change to try it. But we definitely know they has the worst Sale.<//Text>

<review>Excellent experience at Hyundai of Serramonte! We were greeted immediately by Claudio, who was very knowledgeable about the various vehicles we were interested in. After test-driving two cars and voicing a preference for one, we were introduced to Andre.

Andre helped us negotiate a very fair price and then brought us to meet the finance manager, Quok. He was very helpful with the closing of the transaction and we drove home with our new Santa Fe!.

We would buy from Hyundai of Serramonte again!</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rate>

The work itself is good at the service center but they need to do training with those that answer the phone.  I had a problem (long story) and called to check on something the day after I had an expensive servicing done.  The woman on the phone was rude and short with me.<//Review>

Mark was very helpful and friendly - I hadn't done maintenance in quite a while but he was patient and explained everything very clearly. He was honest about the time and cost.

They've set up a comfy area with TVs and hot beverages if you're waiting and it's a quick hop to food/shopping too!< /text>

I didn’t feel like I was being pushed out the door when I was done.  Also, the young man that drives the shuttle is wonderful. Everyone treated us well. Great experience< /review>< Resp>

I was so pleased with the service at your service center. Everyone was incredibly nice and welcoming. We certainly appreciated it. Jessica and Vic were both professional and courteous. I would highly recommend your service center. From the smiling faces and free coffee...couldn’t have asked for better service.
Thank you for everything, Jamie & Jessica Frankos</Review>

Justin was a true professional. He listened to my priorities first. Then he explained my options very clearly and efficiently. His knowledge of both the product and the process of walking me through it are superb. Hyundai should be very proud to have him represent their brand.<//Text>

Each time when I picked up my car, the cashier always have someone bring my car out or it is already parked in the front. This time the cashier just handed me the key and said your car is in the left side of the parking lot?  I went out of the front door and walked to the left side of the building and looked for my car which is parked way down on the left side
. I noticed the customer in front of me had her car bring up to the front and there is no customer after me. Is this good customer service or ?<//Review>< pics>

Bought a certified pre-owned vehicle from Hyundai Serramonte. Car was clean and in perfect condition.  Worked with Nick, he was great and all staff were very friendly and helpful.  Nick called and followed up to make sure we were happy.  Would definitely like to deal with them again.  Made car buying a very pleasant experience.<//review>

My initial thoughts were to leave them a 4 star review but when I considered everything, I came up with a 4.5 so I rounded up.

While the service itself took much too long for a customer who made an appointment to wait, the team did their best to get the car complete and ready as quickly as possible, given the circumstances .they got a half star for effort, resulting in a full star overall.

I don't know if it's policy to always wash the car when complete but my first service did not include a wash, this one did.

I think if the dealership is able to retain their employees, (pay them well so they want to stay!), they have a good chance at becoming a 5 star service every time.</text>

Sherry was so helpful and gave us a few options for the repairs to our car! It was clear, honest and refreshing experience for car service shop.

Also, Jennifer who helped us the first time with replacing parts due to recalled items was very pleasant and helpful.</Text>

The people are excellent and super friendly and helpful. They always are willing to help and have a smile on their faces. I think they were backed up the day I dropped my car because they called and asked if I could pick the car up first thing the next morning even though I had an appointment. But my car was returned to me good to go and they even cleaned it for me!< /review>

Israel was an excellent customer service person. He took hold of the situation with Satisfaction guaranteed. He did a great job with a difficult customer, me. I am a old man ,75, did not Anaheim a shuttle to San Mateo Then offered a Tent a car. Too much hassle.  Then pushed up my repairs which was done in 2 1/2 hours. Plus they even cleaned the inside of my car! Thanks again Israel. Johnpatrickelly<//text>

I've contacted this service dealership based on Google reviews and so happy that I did.
Matthew has been amazing from the moment I've explained what happened to my car to the moment when I left dealership with fixed clutch.
The entire team has helped on the way: Matthew started with estimate which he hasn't changed even after the car has been diagnosed, Jefti (mechanic) did the test drive and explained what has to be fixed/replaced; I've received pictures and updates as the car has been fixed and felt confident about repairs that have been completed.
Even though it's not my original dealership, I will be coming back here for maintenance (hopefully no more unexpected repairs) and strongly recommend this friendly team for any work one needs to get done on their Hyundai.<//Text>< Date>

Claudio and Simom listened to my car needs and what I was set on. Not pushy but professional and overall being real people. I had a smooth buying car experience. People like them would mostly likely convince me to be a loyal Hyundai customer. I will be back for another car in the future.

Highlight of my experience: They honored and worked with my own lender that I brought in.

Walked into Hyundai just to check things out. Andre Kamali’s approached my uncle and I and asked how he could help. He was friendly and was able to answer all our questions. We had the test drive and I really liked the Elentra. But I told Andre that I’m just looking around and had other cars to test drive that day so I won’t be making any decisions at the moment. He gave me his number and told me to call if I had any more questions. I was impressed by their costumer’s service and I really like the Electra. It was easy to drive and the price was exactly what I wanted. Thanks, Andre!< /review>

I have never felt that way at a car dealership, but I was impressed with how they took care of me. Israel told me when I arrived to relax and have a seat while I wait to get my appointment set up then he came to me to discuss what I wante rd done to my car.

<Text>Sherry was the one who took care of me when I got there. I felt she had great customer service and told me what was going to be done on my car. She even added my service warranty info on my profile so I don't have to keep bringing in a copy each time I bring my car in...not like the 1st two visits where they didn't bother to add it and made me get the reimbursement myself. I also felt she didn't add unnecessary services to get make me pay more. Sherry explained to me afterwards what was done and what may need to be done on the next service.  She is definitely a nice addition to the front service desk.<//Text>< Pics>

I had a wonderful experience at Hyundai of Serramonte. I visited recently looking for more information and a test drive and I was assisted by Justin Johnson. He was helpful, knowledgeable, and patient. We were able to work out a deal and I am the proud owner of a new Ioniq! Make sure to check out Hyundai of Serramonte and ask for Justin.<//Review>

<Review>Excellent place to get a 30,000 mile service. It will cost about 900-1000$  but they do a good job.  The shuttle bus driver Victor was especially good- he was multi tasking and driving at the same time. Definitely in the ball.  Kourosh was also very helpful in suggestions on the beat way to take care of my car.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This past Sunday's experience with Hyundai of Serramonte was so very
excellent in every respect. Much, much of this goes to Erica and Bernie who
made it such a great experience. Fee in Finance made it a quick process and we were out of there nicely. Best of all we left with a beautiful Ruby Wine Tucson washed and filled with gas to start out the adventure.Now we
look forward to a call to bring the car in for a coating inside and out to protect our investment, Kudos to all of you!<//Text>

Erika was very nice and gained our trust. Originally were not thinking about buying a vehicle just yet and had our eyes on a Honda but during the test drive and talking to Erika, we began to feel comfortable with her and the vehicle and she actually made it easy for us to make a decision. We are happy with our new vehicle and it was a great chatting with her. We both agree and are so happy that we bought our new vehicle from there than the other dealership.< /text>

<text>Went for 3 recalls and they told me I would be there for 3 hours. After an hour I saw my car parked in front of the building. It seemed too quick for 3 recalls. They waited 45 minutes before giving it to me. As I was headed home I heard a loud noise around the right tire of my car. The fender liner was detached and torn once I got home. I went the next day expecting they'd replace it, but they just reattached it with a zip tie. The lady said they didn't touch that part but they checked my tires and front breaks for a courtesy check, so I believe they did. Then they told me my car was missing a part under the vehicle but they never put it on the report when I went for the recalls. I was expecting more from a dealer and thought it was unprofessional.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I'm still in the process of buying a car, but I wanted to share my current experience. Simon Calimlim (sales rep) greeted me and was unlike most car salespeople. He took me out on a couple of test drives and he patiently helped me narrow down my options. I really wanted to give him my business, but his manager couldn't come down far enough on the price. I totally understand that they have to run a business. Since I can't buy it from them, I wanted to say that Simon is a great sales rep. He gets 5 stars for being responsive and an overall cool dude.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1537037570872, 'text': 'Thank you for a great review.

<text>We worked with Sal, our salesman, and  Rich in financing. They were both easy to get along with and able to answer our questions. We actually had a lot of fun purchasing our new car. The process took us about 4 hours from finding the car, running credit and purchasing the vehicle. Sal & Rich made it easy! I will absolutely be returning to this dealership in the future.< /text><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Very efficient service.  Vehicle is ready as promised. Sometimes even earlier. Free car wash for me is a plus. Jessica, the service advisor exudes professionalism and brings customer service to a new level. Oh yeah , Vic is a very friendly and courteous transport driver. Great team.

My Hyundai Ioniq broke down while driving on the freeway last Father's Day. It was on the shop for 2 weeks. Though I'm starting to regret buying a first generation model the maintenance team was awesome. Sherry was constantly giving me updates the whole time and the rest of service advisors were promptly responsive for inquiries. Great team! I wish I could say  the same thing with the car. I'm starting to worry when the warranty expires.</Text>

<review>I am very satisfied with my Hyundai Elantra sport purchase! My sales experience was great and our dealer, Justin Johnson, was very patient with me in helping me choose the trim and color of my car. He was helpful in explaining he differences between the trims and made sure that I was happy with my choice and that I was able to find the car that I was looking for. He explained the features of the car and also showed me where the service center was. He was also very friendly and easy to talk to.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>I had a good experience and the team called me later in the day to tell me my car had been fixed. I originally thought it would take much longer to get done and wasn’t anticipating the timely response. When I got to the dealership they told me there were two burnt coils that they replaced and that I would be good to go. I was excited until the problem that I took my car in for in the first place, started occurring less than a week after they supposedly fixed it. I will be bringing my car back for them to check out again.< /review>< pics>

Mark did a great job explaining the possible service options for my first major 30,000 mileage maintenance for my Hyundai Tucson. He also mentioned that I would get a phone call when my car would be ready and surely enough he did just that. He also called me to let me know the stats I needed to know such as my brakes, etc. Very straight-forward.</text>

<time>1562116724422</time><Review>This was the worst car buying experience I've ever had. I felt like I was pressured into buying a car, and then I was antagonized by other employees (not the salesperson that was helping me) for asking my father whether I should go through with it. We agreed on a 3% interest rate for 5 years and I signed my contract. A week and a half later they called me to come back in, to tell me that the loan wasn't approved and that my interest was going to be brought up to 10%. I told them that I didn't agree to that so I wanted to get my old car back. They pressured me into keeping the car and said that I had no other option. So here I am paying 10% interest, even though I had good credit and my loan got pushed up to 6 years (they originally told me it would stay 5 years but when I read the fine print it was 6 years). I would steer clear of this place and go somewhere else where the employees won't try to take advantage of you.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Well, at first this place was great, all the way till you get to the end of the sale cycle then it goes strongly down hill. Bottom line is the team can't be trusted. It's a very common "used car salesperson" mentality. Highly recommend Hyundai as a vehicle, but it's well worth taking your business to Dublin.< /Text>< gmap_id>

My Hyundai , experience was great!
Sales crew all very informative and patient with all of our questions and we also got what we believe to be a great deal. Hyundai’s 10 year warranty is what made us decide on closing and going home with a new car.< /Review>

I always book the early appointments to be sure to get my car in a decent amount of time, which I did. This time I waited while the oil was being changed. The service was completed in a little over an hour.   Service was good, and the adviser went over the routine maintenance that was suggested at 90K miles. I declined because the price was ridiculously expensive.</review>

I worked with John who was my Sales Rep and Phi the Finance Mgr. I knew exactly what I wanted because I heard and read very good things about the safety features of the Hyundai Tucson. When I arrived I was paired with John. He was very professional and patient with all of my inquiries. Once I settled on my dream ride my husband and I met with Phi. We felt that Phi worked with us to choose the options that we wanted at a fair price. Check them out at Serramonte Hyundai!! We left feeling very comfortable and satisfied with our purchase.</Text>

< Review>
I don't normally gives review but this place needs one. I purchase a used car last Feb. after couple of weeks i found out that the AC Button has Malfunction. I tried to get a hold of couple of people and went to services they assure me that they will purchase the part and will follow up. after a month no one getting a hold with me and tried to contact the manager of services he give me round about and that they have change a used car manager. until now i don't have my AC Button replaced and My License plate still not available i Tried to get a hold of DMV clerk but no one is calling me back. Its a really bad experience. I wish i don't have to do this review but this place need to be trained about accountability.  More updates to follow.</Review>

<Review>This happen quite a long while ago.  I came in for a test drive Amazon promotion and was promised a certificate sent to me by email which never arrived.  Repeated calls to the dealership yelled no resolution.  Finally I was told it was a third party promotion and I had to call back 3 more times until someone was able to resend my certificate.  If you're going to run a promotion like that with what I'm assuming is 100s of people walking in I'd at least expect to have all the kinks worked out.  This was my first visit to any Hyundai dealership which didn't leave me with a great impression.  On a plus side the gentleman that gave me a test drive was very nice and he went through all the features on the car.<//Review>< Name>

Michael Pan was incredibly helpful and honest to deal with.  He made the buying experience very straight forward.  There were no shady tactics or feelings you were being taken for.  I would definitely buy here again.<//text>

<Review>I was impressed with Hyundai and my service rep Oscar. Hyundai honored their 10 year/100,000 mile guarantee by replacing our motor that failed with 82k miles on it with no charge to us. The parts for replacement were on back order and Oscar made sure to keep us well inform of all progress as well as setting us up with a rental car and a sweet brand new loaner car during our downtime. Even though we were without are car for close to 2 months we felt very taken care of.</Review>< Pics>

always a great help. Oscar is my go to guy he never lets me leave without understanding what's going on with my car and if I ever have to leave my car with them for a few days he makes sure that he calls me to keep me updated. I didn't get a complimentary wash the last time I left my car for a service, but no big deal .... the way they were able to accommodate me made up for it 😊</review>

Oscar (service manager) has been available, every time I called. When I have a question regarding my vehicle , I know I will be taken care of. That is a secure feeling. The courtesy vehicle is readily available to give me a ride to and to pick me up, so I can take care of errands while my car is being serviced.  Excellent service. - Esther< /review>

Again the rep hung up on me, so I called a third time and was not greeted at all, just immediately put on hold. When someone finally answers she was rude and acted like I was bothering her by asking her to do her job.

The Hyundai Serramonte was extremely helpful. I had an awful smell coming from my AC and called them for an appointment. I was able to get a same Day appointment which was fantastic. I dropped my car off around 11:30 and Juan, the man who helped me, was very attentive and friendly. He addressed all my questions and provided me with extra information that helped me understand what could possibly be going on with my car. I picked my car up at 4:30 and the smell was completely gone. It was very easy and quick to deal with Hyundai of Serramonte.< /text>

Hyundai Serramonte Service never disappoints.  Work is always excellent, thorough, and on time.  They never push services or parts not needed. Customer service is as one would expect -- courteous, helpful, friendly.  Oscar Delgadillo is my favorite go-to service advisor, although I'm sure all others are also very good. I give Hyundai Service Dept and its personnel an excellent rating.<//Review>

Brought my car in for maintenance. Friendly greeting from front desk. Service was completed in timely matter. More stars if they cleaned my car more thoroughly. Looks like they did not attempt to dust the dashboard at all and I couldn't really tell if they washed my car.< /Review>

The lock on my trunk was jammed and the worst part is that I'm an Uber driver and the customers luggage was still stuck inside! I was totally freaked out. Since this was a warranted part I wasn't charged a dime because they had to go through the back seat to get the lock opened. Although they were out of the part, they found out my local Hyundai dealership had the part and booked me an appointment the same day.  I cant say enough kind words as I was really stressed and upset over the whole ordeal S I had to sleep in my car at the dealership over night. Serramonye Hyundai took really great care of me.< /review>< Pictures>

I had an appointment on the 25th of April at 10am and promptly arrived but had to stand in line for over 30 minutes to turn my car in. The "service adviser" took my car and told me that my car should be ready at 2pm (regular oil change/75 mile maintenance & passenger occupant detecting sensor - under warranty). I phoned them at 3pm and was told that my car was ready. I told the service department that I would be on my way to pick up my car.
When I arrived, I was told that my "service adviser" was not available and I would have to wait until he returned. I told them that I was told that my car was completed and I told them over 30 minutes before that I was on my way to pick up my car. I had to wait for over 20 more minutes for a different "service adviser" to complete my paperwork so I could pay my bill and leave.
I was charged almost $300 in labor for an oil change, to top off my windshield fluid and add oil conditioner and injector cleaner.
I knew that the bill would be over $300 when I dropped it off because the "service adviser" advised me that my car needed the 75K mile service. There was neither tire rotation nor air or cabin filter replacement conducted (as per my instructions – my rear tires are wider than my front tires). I have been taking my vehicle to a Hyundai service center since I bought my car approx. five years ago but I will NEVER take any of my vehicles to Serramonte Hyundai Service Center again!
I had to request the itemized checklist from the cashier and did not have the opportunity to discuss anything about my vehicle upon leaving and paying my bill!
I’ll be glad to share my experience!< /Review>

Very friendly staff. They answer all your questions with at most insight and provide a great customer service. Don’t worry about grabbing a coffee before getting there for you servicing, they have Starbucks coffee machine on location. Work and time estimation is pretty accurate, which makes it easy to plan your activities.< /Review>

1.) First, when I arrive I say I am ready to buy, and this process needs to take under an hour, so lets fill out the paperwork now, get the details settled, and then I'll test drive the car to make sure there's nothing wrong with it. Well, they insist I drive the car first, and then after, sure enough, they take over an hour and a half to "work out a deal" with the bank. I'm aware that dealers use a "wearing you down" tactic by making you wait a long times so you just take a bad deal out of impatience-I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed this wasn't the case.
(Minus One Star)
-Note that they said it was a bank "requirement" that we get an extended warranty, since my credit isn't perfect and that would make the lender feel "safe" and give us a good deal. Sounded like total BULLSH**, but I figured, why not, I could probably use the warranty anyways.

2.) When they finally get us into a room to sign, they don't actually have papers.
No, they have a "DocuSign" tablet thing that, which not only seems FAR less secure than just doing things on paper, but also takes extra time to "flip" pages. I've bought cars at dealers before, usually it's boom-boom-boom, sign all these places and your done in less than 15 minutes. Not the case here.
(Minus One Star)

3.) During the horrible signing process, we are now running on being at this dealership for over 2 hours.
Then the DocuSign tablet "crashes" on the last page, and wouldn't you know it, they have no paper back ups, so we are left waiting over an hour before they get it back up.
(Minus One Star)

4.) We finally get everything wrapped up, and then the salesperson who had been "wheelin' and dealin" with the bank for us, comes and gives us one. single. key. I thought it was suspicious but more over insulting that when spending over 25 grand on a car, you can't give me an extra key for 200 bucks
-Don't worry, Hyundai of Serramonte does have a customers relations department that reached out via email after the purchase, and when I mentioned all these grievances, they responded with.... well they didn't, they just ignored me completely.
(Minus One Star)

5.) Last and best of all-
I'm not pointing fingers or anything, but the car I bought from them ends up getting STOLEN ONLY 11 DAYS AFTER I BOUGHT IT FROM THEM. Right out front of my home. No broken glass, alarm, or any notion of a forced entry. Come to hear from one the employees there that they actually sold a similar model car (SS Camaro) there after I purchased mine, and that car was stolen within a single day.
(MINUS 10 STARS)
Take note of the other one star reviews on here and DO NOT TRUST THEM. There is something not right going on over there.

Update: When I returned to the dealership to cancel my warranty, they never sent the paperwork to the warranty company. I called the warranty company 11 days after submitting the paperwork and they said they received nothing and it was still active. Incompetent and rude doesn't even begin to describe this place.</Review>< Pictures>

Everyone was very helpful. I was shocked to see such teamwork. We purchased a 2019 vehicle, and even drove it home to see if it fit in our steep driveway. It fit!!<//review>

My car needed a oil change, so I visited Serrano the Hyundai. I must say, I didn’t particularly care for most of the employees theirwith the exception of one. David. David came right over to me and took care of my needs without any hesitation. Because if David, I will most likely return again, but only to conduct business with him. Thank you David for taking care of my vehicle needs. Also, thanks for the great laughs. Cheers!</Review>

I was advised that the lock on my trunk was broken and it would cost $300 to fix but after I asked what was wrong the mechanic noticed that they actually locked the trunk and the trunk was in perfect condition. They were trying to provide a quote for something that did not need to be repaired. It was in perfect condition. So, how can I trust the price quote that was provided when they can't even identify issues with their own car?! I waited an hour to be picked up from Bart with their complementary pick up service and ended up having to take an uber because the driver never picked me up. I was advised that they would wash my car, that didn't happen. I was told I would be given a quote for something on my car and I never received one. Basically, worst service ever! However, the customer representative was kind and helped me as much as possible. Go somewhere else for service. I won't use Hyundai again!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Brought my vehicle to the service center and I felt that I could not trust the agent I dealt with. He lacked professionalism and detail while dealing with my vehicle. I brought it in for a diagnostic and my vehicle was not returned in the same condition I left it. I sought a detailed estimate with part numbers and labor detailed throughout for the repairs needed and was told "I can't pull that up". Did not expect this from a dealer. I got the vibe that I was being over charged with no reference material provided. This is definitely the last place I would recommend anyone bring their vehicle.

We originally had our eye set for two Pre-Owned 2017 Hyundai Elantras but we happened to stumble upon a Pre-Owned 2017 Hyundai Sonata with 33K for mileage.

Jonathan helped us out so much by making sure we got the best deal possible within our budget. After thinking about the purchase of the car for two day, my family and I were very happy with the condition and price offered for the car.

Although we weren't able to get the deal we offered to their management staff, we continued with our purchase for the 2017 Sonata for an amazing deal off the market for the Bay Area. Jonathan was able to fill up the tank with gas as well as giving the car a nice car wash before leaving the lot.

Without Jonathan's excellent service and help, I wouldn't be the owner to my very first dream car. If you were planning on checking out cars in the Serramonte Hyundai lot, be sure to look if Jonathan is working that day and you will for sure be in excellent hands.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I was looking for a used Camry and found one online that was located at Hyundai Serramonte. The car was in good shape but had a chip in the window and the panel between the driver and passenger windows was faded. Zamir said that both of those items would be fixed. They were not. About a month after the purchase I went to the dealership and was taken down the road to the service facility. The manager was out and I was told that she would call me soon. She did not and has not now even 2 months later.
I bought the car with cash. I told them I did not want a service warranty. They had me sign the papers with their finance guy who mislead me about the warranty contract. I thought the contract was one price but it turned out to be higher. I had signed about 20 pages at that point and didn't catch the fact that the service contract was different than what I was told.
The car was fine. They let me take it home overnight to test it. But beware the other items involved in the purchase.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I was greeted and assisted by the most helpful Jessica Petty. She assured me that they could definitely get that rear wiper blade purchased and installed in a jiffy. When she checked my VIN on the car she had to wipe away ash and dirt from my window just to see it...and I apologized for not having washed it prior.

<Review>Steven Li, Sales Representive was quite patient with this 82 year old lady. I had a budget and he and Tommy Gheran took the time to get me an economical car that met my approval with my budget. Steven is a people person. He listens to you; he did not try to sell me a car that I was skeptical of. I don't drive much. Just need a car for church, grocery shopping and short trips sometimes. Steven is energetic and I appreciated that about him. I love the car he and Tommy met my budget.

<review>Came in today to purchase and get a new key for my brother’s car and received the rudest customer service. Never informed by the cashier whom I spoke to, Patricia, that the car needed to be present and explained it to the workers but was treated with disrespect and didn’t care for the situation at all and didn’t bother to work with me. Would rate 0 stars if possible, worst customer service I have ever received. I would recommend corporate to hire/better train these workers as they were very rude and unprofessional in dealing with the situation. At least work on better communication as to not waste customer’s time.<//review>< pics>

<text>Had a nice experience with sales person Jonathan Martinez. He was one of those salesmen who truly wanted to help the customer, and I feel that even if we didn't buy a car from him, he would have been cool with that, too. The finance manager "Albert" was very patient and answered and re-answered all of our questions.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I was upsold on $4100 of accessory items: window tinting for $1700 and installation of rear sensors for $2,200 and $300 for rear bumper applique that is already installed and included in the msrp.

I was contacted recently for a pending resolution.  Once we reach an agreement, I’ll update the review to reflect any actions taken.</Text>< date>

Adam was really helpful and easy to talk to, not a pushy sales talker. Gave us the best deals into getting a new leased car, and considered our situation to benefit both the dealership and the buyer. Much Recommend to go to if you buy a car at hyundai.< /review>

Terrible experience more than once at this Hyundai Service center in Serramonte.  Had no record of the appointment I made online.  Didn't have the parts in stock for my recall.  Rescheduled for the following week and received a call as I was on my way that they didn't have the other part for service.  Essentially took 3 of my Saturdays dealing with this and I don't even think they did everything I needed done for my 22,500 mi service because they were focused on the recall parts.<//Review>

<text>Terrible customer service. Contacted Hyundai of Serramonte numerous times by phone and e-mail looking for information on a used vehicle they had listed. They first tried to tell me about a completely different car than the car I was interested in. Then never got back to me with information I was requesting. Instead of getting back to me they jacked the vehicles price up two thousand dollars and ignored me. I wanted more information before I wasted my time traveling to them. They made my decision easy to not buy from them.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>My experience at Hyundai Serramonte was disappointing to say the least. I went in with my mother in-law and we were met with gross incompetence nearly every step of the way. What should have been a simple buying process(we were paying cash, not even getting a loan) took 7 hours! I really like Hyundai's and this was our 3rd one in the family but none of us will ever shop at this dealer again.</text>< Pictures>

<resp>None</resp><Time>1561090521870< /Time><text>PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING A CAR FROM HYUNDAI OF SERRAMONTE.  The only thing this dealership has going for them is that their staff are pleasant to work with. But that's also probably how they get away with scamming and lying to customers. I should have backed out of the purchase of my vehicle when the Sales Manager was very pushy and wanted me to purchase it right then and there. I kept saying I wanted to sleep on it and he tried guilting me that he needed the sale that night. I did really like the car but felt uneasy. They kept asking for my social security number, and I said I did not want to give it. I was going to pay cash and I already knew what my credit score was. They said ok and proceeded to pull up the purchasing papers and such. I did not take the car home that night, I said I'd return tomorrow. Also, this all occurred at the end of October 2018. The next morning I was browsing online before I went to the dealership. As I look on their website, the car I was about to buy was $2000 less than what they were trying to sell it to me for. So, I went in and said I was going elsewhere to purchase a car since they lied from the get go. They said they'd honor the price online and give me a better warranty deal. The car was used and had no plates, nor did I receive plates when I purchased the car. They said they would order the plates and I'll received them soon. A couple weeks go by and I received my title and registration, but no plates. I called the dealership and they said it can take up to 6 months to get. I felt odd about this and decided to go into the dealership. They said their DMV person wasnt in but they will talk to her and she'll call me. Needless to say almost 8 months have gone by, about 20 messages and 10 drop ins to the dealership to talk to their DMV person, who still has never once attempted to contact me. They lied over and over stating my plates had been ordered and said it was the Sacramento DMV office who is at fault. I had to take the day off from work to go into the DMV to find out they NEVER ordered my plates. And I had to pay a hefty fee for my registration because they messed up on that too. I reached out to a manager who forwarded my email about how disappointing and horrible experience I've had with them. They not only ran my credit without permission once but TWICE also! They tried to cover their tracks with this one. Stating they had to, to make sure I was a terrorist. I called 10 other Bay Area dealerships who laughed when I asked if I paid cash for a car right now would they run my credit and they said no. They would run a brief inquiry to make sure I was myself, and this would not show up on my credit report. Once again another big fat lie by Hyundai of Serramonte. This next lady states she would refund me for the plates and correct the two credit inquiries. I thought this was great I was finally getting somewhere. Two weeks go by so I reach out to her again to ask when and how will I be getting a refund and when should I expect for them to contact the credit bureaus. She ignored me questions and tried to cover there tracks some more. I emailed her again and cc'd the manager who I thought was attempting to get this cleared but. It has been over 2 months since I have heard from anyone at this dealership. I asked for the trouble, hassle and lies they need to give me a full refund of my warranty and keep it attached to my car. Still no answer.  Even spoke to another Hyundai dealership and the Bay Area and they were appalled by what I told them about my experience. they stated they lied about credit run and they may be doing something shady beyond that with my social security number. I wrote this to help others before dealing with Hyundai of Serramonte. They are scammers and liars!!!!!! They will dismiss you and then never reply to your emails or if you're there DMV person return any of your calls and messages left! I truly wish I never purchased a car from Hyundai of Serramonte!!!!! This has been the worst experience of my life and how it is still dragging on 8 months later.<//text><Rating>1< /Rating></record>

< review>
If could give a zero star, I would do so.  When I purchased my Kona 2018 back in June 2018, the sales sold me an Express Five Dent and Ding repair plan.  When I needed to make a claim for a dent in March 2019,  I found out that the dent repair only covers dent without any paint loss.  Well, how often do you have a dent without scrapping off paint?  Almost never!  So I decided to cancel the remaining insurance coverage, because it is not useful .

I had to go to Hyundai  dealership in personal to sign a cancellation form.  The gentleman who processed the paperwork on 4/12/2019  was helpful.  He told me that if I do not receive the refund check in the mail in a few weeks, I should contact Lorie in their Business Office.   I thought it would be a very straight forward process, as the contract itself stated that at anytime the plan can be canceled.

What awaits me next has been a nightmare.  A month passed and I still did  not receive my $840.83 cancellation refund.  Thus I called Express Five. on 5/13/2019. The service representative advised me that the cancellation was processed and approved on 4/25/2019, and all necessary documentations have been forwarded to Hyundai for them to issue me my refund  since 5/22/2019.  If  there are issues, I need to contact the dealer's business office directly.

Since 5/13/2019, I have contacted Hyundai business office many times and given the following run around:  have to wait for Express Five to pay Hyundai dealer in order to issue me the refund; the business office manager is not in: waiting for the controller Patty, who is the only one who has the authorization to sign the check, who works at another location, who does not have a phone number I can contact her, etc.  The excuses go on and on.  In this age and time, I cannot believe a firm of this size is UNABLE to issue a legitimate refund of less than $1000 within 5 business day.

It is now 6/10/2019,  more than 3 weeks have passed, I still have not seen my refund check.  If this is how Hyundai  Serramonte manages its businesses, buyers better beware and  go to another dealership.   What happened to customer service?  Hyundai Serramonte was so concerned about your response to the satisfaction survey after your initial vehicle purchase, but falls way short of providing satisfying customer service afterward.

I hope to get my refund soon.  If not, I will complain to the Better Business Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, and seek help from Channel  7's Mike Finney.</review>

Started out fine. Got early appointment for factory software upgrade (no charge) and was serviced right away. Technician discovered car needed battery replacement so I agreed to the replacement. But now, my gas gauge is not working though was fine before going in for service. Now I have to go back again...what a waste of my time. Hope they didn't mess something up so they can charge me for a car problem that they caused. Will update after next visit.< /Review>

Helpful, low pressure staff that will earn your business.

Shoutout to Andrez and Abdul for providing me a smooth buying process.

Good:
Staff will reasonably negotiate out/reduce addons, paint protection, glass etching, costco/truecar. Extended warranty and service contracts are transparent. Honorably uses truth in lending and monthly payment as offers (No 4square).

Need improvement:
1.0) Fit car to driver's lifestyle
1.1) Non-technical people my choose the wrong car.
2.0) Be experts on the equipped technology.
2.1) I did 90% of the research about the vehicle and fair negotiation.< /review>

Very unhappy with my experience. It took many calls per day to try and get a hold of the secretary and service advisor. When fixing my ignition switch, technician burned out the car starter and had it to be replaced at my expense. Now, car smells like burning electrical parts and check engine light is on. Again, it is taking many calls from me to get a hold of service technician, and receptionist is clueless. I managed to get a hold of service manager on my own, but NO ONE from Hyundai has called me on the status. Emails and repeated calls to customer satisfaction manager are unanswered.

If my car is damaged, see you guys in court.< /Text>

Great experience ar Hyundai Serramonte. Fernando helped me get a great car. He was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable.  I was at the dealership at lunchtime.  They gave a yummy chicken skewer to eat when I mentioned that I was hungry.

I brought a 2018 Elantra Limited in the exact color I wanted. Galactic Grey. I am very happy with my new car.< /review>

<review>We visited Subaru first and had an unwelcoming experience. Justin at Hyundai was friendly, took care of us, helped us work within our budget, and got us what we needed. Working with Justin is highly recommended especially if you're afraid of being bsed by car salespeople. You'll get a good deal but definitely as with any big purchase like this be mindful of asking for all the clear costs and details and make sure your expectations are clear and they’ll work with you. Got a new blue Kona!<//review>< time>

<text>The sales staff and management are friendly and promise you everything. However will not put anything in writing. I was told I would get floor mats and a replacement key since the key was not in good condition. Since then I’ve been ignored by the sales people.

I made an arrangement with the finance department to pay a $2000.00 down payment and i would be given 2 weeks to allow them to process the checks. The dealership processed the checks before I received money and with my permission. Therefore caused the bank to change me a return check fee.

I’ll be posting my experience on Yelp and encouraging people to never buy a car there.<//text>< Pictures>

Never write reviews but I had to say something. I immediately got a sketched out feeling when entering the dealership, they offered a great deal and offered to put in new speakers, as soon as it came to signing they were back on their agreement and said they'd see what they could do. While I was waiting, two other men were discussing how they bought a car earlier and the paint washed off to show a bunch of scratches, and they didn't seem to be getting much help from the salesman. Super sketchy, the reviews are accurate. Listen to them.</review>

If I could leave 0 stars, I would. My car has been at this service location for a week to deal with 5 Hyundai recalls and engine problems, and  I have still not received an update or callback from my service advisor, despite leaving daily messages and making daily phone calls. Very disappointed with this service. Would not recommend.</Text>

<review>I appreciate this opportunity to share the feedback for the service of Hyundai of Serramonte. As a new undergraduate, many of my friends are also new undergraduate and asking about my experience of purchasing a new car at Serramonte Hyundai as they are very interested in purchasing one. Well,I honestly said to them: "if you like being tricked, treated with disrepect,they are there!". Unprofessional staff, wrong information, ruin away the benefits and services you could have. After purchasing a new car,  I went to the office and asked for help, waited for a hour and nobody helped me. ( technically not asking for help, just follow up with what I suppose to get)  Of course I did not wait for them any longer, so  I left my contact information and my inquiry, and they promised will call me. I waited for 1 month, nobody called, So I called in to follow up with my case and they promised to call back. I waited another 2 months, no one ever called. I dropped in the office again, asked for the status. Ridiculously, no one in the office aware of my inquiry until I told them at the day and on one ever contact me. My problem did not get fixed at all and all I found out was I was being tricked. All they said is they can't help, the person left the office no longer worked here. This is ridiculous!<//review></record>

Staffs are nice. Environment is clean. Service time is kinda long though. They offer Starbucks coffee here. Wifi is pretty slow but very stable. Not good enough for streaming videos or anything. However, it's stable enough for browsing. Well, much better waiting here than any other car maintenance shop.

Now for the down side. You can't do much other than waiting here. There isn't many places near by where you can go unless you don't mind a kinda long walk.<//review>

Absolutely the worst customer service I’ve experienced.   First, I was promised that the car would be avail at 1.  At 2, I texted the consultant and did not get responses.   What good is it to text me the consultants numbers with my cell novice if my text was not going to be answered??   At 3 I called the main reception twice who tried to locate my car consultant and on the third try I made it through.    He said he would contact the driver to pick me up and an hour later I’m still waiting for the driver to call back.   I finally called the main reception and they were able to setup the driver.    The only good experience was the driver, victor....he was friendly, responsive and did what he said he would.   Fire kourosh.....if I have to work through him again, I would rather go to another dealership.   Promote victor the driver ....he’s awesome.<//Review>

<Review>Went to get my breaks checked out. They quoted me $665 for just my front breaks and breaker fluid. I left and went to another shop where I was charged $289. I would never recommend this play. They see a young girl and think she’s dumb enough to pay $665 just for FRONT breaks! Never giving them my money again and I recommend everyone to do their research before going there.</Review>< Pics>

A week or so after the work was done I noticed that one of the daytime running lights in the bumper was not working.  It took me about a month to swing by to see if it just might not have been reconnected when the bumper was reinstalled.  I was unable to leave the car overnight, so I didn't return to have the work done until July.  By then, I might have expected that I would be unable to get it repaired under the original work order.  It was found that it had never been plugged in so there was no charge for the repair.  In addition, I needed a ride to and from my home in San Francisco which was provided by their shuttle driver for no cost and with a smile.  Really super customer service!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

Hyundai of Serramonte, m,wiserable experience! They pulled a fast one on us on the price. They did not make agreed upon repairs that we paid for. Took 13 days to take delivery even then it wasn't ready. Albert the sales manager needs to go. Will never go back and will tell everyone I know to avoid the place like the plague.< /Text>

Anthony'}< /response><review>The problem of poor gas mileage in the City was improved along with the delay in acceration by replacing the transmission,but the idle is still not smooth in neutral. I’m also still not happy with Serramonte Hyundai in that when I first took the car in for the above issues, I was told “there’s nothing wrong with the car!”  Don’t ever give that response to a customer. If there was nothing wrong,why would I have brought it in?  It took me complaining to regional Hyundai to get the issues addressed. When the technician rode with me, he agreed that something was wrong. What Serramonte SHOULD have said was “something is wrong but we don’t know what it is”. Regional engineers suggested replacing different systems over almost three months,until a transmission part was replaced. That solved the city mileage problem and stopped the acceleration issue, but didn’t solve the original issue of rough idle in neutral. The Serramonte technician who worked on the car was terrific: notifying me of the progress along the way. I guess that I’m disappointed with regional engineering that they didn’t know what was  wrong with the car in the first place. I CAN’T believe this is the only  Elantra that has had these issues. We love our Elantra, and would like to be able to keep enjoying driving this fun little car, and be able to completely recommend Hyundai to our friends and family. Thank you Hyundai and Serramonte Hyundai for your diligence in making the effort to solve the issues.< /review><gmap_id>0x808f7bee7aee7587:0xcfea9d45a28a618f< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Over many weeks of researching various cars I settled for a few brands. I had a professional and friendly experience with Simon Calimlim at Hyundai Serramonte. Over a span of a couple of weeks he patiently answered questions while I finalized my decision. He was very personable and knowledgeable with finance options. Never did I feel rushed or pressured to make a decision, unlike other dealerships. Because of his help, I am now a proud owner of a Ioniq SE Hybrid. Simon was nice enough to call the next day after purchase to see how everything was going. Great customer service follow up! Thanks, Simon!<//text>

They washed my car for me  as a courtesy because of the terrible service we received and they damaged the trim of my brand new car and lied and said they didn’t. They also gave me one price out the door then when we met with the deal closer they added on a $3,000 fee that wasn’t mentioned. Do not go here!!!!<//text>

So disappointed. Spoke to the used car manager about selling my car. During the call he repeated back my name and car brand and model. He also assured me he would honor the Kelly Blue Book price range.

By Saturday, my name, according to the dealership receptionist, went from Lori to Sherryn. The car went from a Kia to a Toyota. And the price being offered on my car went from $3000-6000 range to $1,000.

I understand that details get lost in the translation when people don't write things down. So I could forgive the mix up in my name and my car's model.

But it's bad and unethical service when the customer is accused of lying when the staff comes in $2000 less than what was quoted on the phone.

I used to love this dealership. But now that it's under new ownership, buyers and sellers beware. The truth may not show up during your transaction. Stay away!< /Review>

Sherry has been so helpful with helping me understand how to do maintenance on my newly purchased used car. She took the time to look through my paperwork with me and called Hyndai in San Jose to get more information. I also want to say how much I appreciated Oscars customer service when I was having an emergency this past Saturday. He is awesome. Everyone at Hyundai’s service department in Colma is the best, including Ariana at the front desk. Thank You!!!!!!</Review>

<Review>My experience was less than satisfactory' although my Initially experience started off well. I dropped off my car at around 10:00 am on Saturday and was given a quote ($1,600)and the car was supposed to be completed the same day. At the time I dropped off my car, I provided my cell phone number to contact me.  At around 5:15 pm I had not received any messages (on my voicemail or via text), so I called and left a message because at this time  the service Dept was closed. I waited to hear on Monday morning and had not heard anything from them, so I called again on Tuesday and spoke with the gal who originally helped me..  I was told that she did try and reach me, but I never answered and she did not leave a message. I asked if she Reyes to text me and she said "NO". She also told me that my quote was going to be higher because I needed tires and my brakes and rotors need to be replaced and I had two bad tires. She said my new quote was $3,000.  I told her that I would get the tires somewhere else.  After speak I g with her, she told me that the rotors would need to be ordered ecause they did not have them in stock. So at this point I had to get a rental car, which they provided.  It would be another two days until my car was ready. So, finally on Thursday I was able to pick up my car.  This was an unsatisfactory experience.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I'm giving it 2 cause I didn't even want to go there due to the rude receptionist I got in the servicing department over the phone. Usually Hyundai sends you a reminder of when you schedule your appointment. I received nothing and had to call in. Lady told my appointment had already passed and they most likely won't be able to take care of my car today. It was mostly her tone which just rude and obnoxious. I'm pretty happy I didn't go there instead I scheduled an appointment for the one in Dublin. Wayyyy better service.<//Review>

Service people are knowledgeable and friendly BUT the facility is a joke.  They park too many cars there, no place to park, my car was almost hit by a delivery truck since he had no place to move around.  When it came time to pick up my car, they just said it was over there, so I had to get it and get out of a tight spot.  when I tried to leave the lot, the cars parked everywhere blocked me in.  I had to go inside and tell them to let me out.  OUTRAGES!< /Text>

When they show you the price posted on the car, ask for the invoice (if they refuse, which they probably won't, ask to see their manager so they can give you the invoice). Request a price $1,000 below the invoice. If they refuse, say you're going somewhere else. Once they agree to the price, have them write it down on paper.

Before you sign your contract with them, make sure it is the price you agreed to- they WILL try to low ball you.

If you have a bad credit score, tell then you won't pay interest above 5%.

Tip: These guys are VERY pushy and they will try to make you feel guilty for not buying their car; even if you insist you are just browsing.

They will tell you the offer is only available for a limited time and that if you come back tomorrow, the offer might be gone. They're just trying to fool you.

I highly recommend walking away once they start with the pressure.

Good luck!< /Text>

<review>90% of the time, I leave a dealership very dissapointed and wonder why I went there but yesterday was so different.  Oscar was my service advisor. He listened to me. When was the last time a service advisor actually listened to you. We had a very nice conversation about my car issues and the Warriors Game coming up that evening while he was filling out my paperwork.  I got a call from him two hours later saying my car was fixed. Thank you to Ethan the mechanic for actually fixing it. I came in picked up my keys and went home with a smile on my face.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I'm giving it 2 cause I didn't even want to go there due to the rude receptionist I got in the servicing department over the phone. Usually Hyundai sends you a reminder of when you schedule your appointment. I received nothing and had to call in. Lady told my appointment had already passed and they most likely won't be able to take care of my car today. It was mostly her tone which just rude and obnoxious. I'm pretty happy I didn't go there instead I scheduled an appointment for the one in Dublin. Wayyyy better service.<//Review>

<Text>This Hyundai is under terrible management. I’ve had two cars processed as lemons thanks to their inability to properly identify and fix issues with my cars. In addition, they don’t offer nearly as many services that most standard Hyundai’s offer such as loaner car service. They simply don’t care about the customer and just want their money<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

You guys are always spot on. Even though I have to come to you all the way from San Francisco, I do because I am happy with the work done and trust the service I get. In the end "TRUST IN THE SERVICE" is what it is all about. I will keep coming back till the long warranty is done and then I will get a NEW Hyundai.</text>

Never have any issue here. It's the fourth year we've been taking our car there and we'll most likely keep going there.

Would give them 5 stars if they were closer to us.< /Review>

< review>
The problem of poor gas mileage in the City was improved along with the delay in acceration by replacing the transmission,but the idle is still not smooth in neutral. I’m also still not happy with Serramonte Hyundai in that when I first took the car in for the above issues, I was told “there’s nothing wrong with the car!”  Don’t ever give that response to a customer. If there was nothing wrong,why would I have brought it in?  It took me complaining to regional Hyundai to get the issues addressed. When the technician rode with me, he agreed that something was wrong. What Serramonte SHOULD have said was “something is wrong but we don’t know what it is”. Regional engineers suggested replacing different systems over almost three months,until a transmission part was replaced. That solved the city mileage problem and stopped the acceleration issue, but didn’t solve the original issue of rough idle in neutral. The Serramonte technician who worked on the car was terrific: notifying me of the progress along the way. I guess that I’m disappointed with regional engineering that they didn’t know what was  wrong with the car in the first place. I CAN’T believe this is the only  Elantra that has had these issues. We love our Elantra, and would like to be able to keep enjoying driving this fun little car, and be able to completely recommend Hyundai to our friends and family. Thank you Hyundai and Serramonte Hyundai for your diligence in making the effort to solve the issues.<//review>

<user_name>ale Tonda< /user_name><Review>The lady at the front door, was not cooperative at all.   I went there to get my car factory inspection done and of course I was looking for the results.  I asked her for help and she said that I got it all, pointing me to the bill!!! Bill has no results, of course.
Then, what also happened is that I checked prices on the web, before going onsite, and lucky for me I was prepared, otherwise I was gonna be charge 60 for a service that on the web was 30.
Do not recommend this place at all.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808f7bee7aee7587:0xcfea9d45a28a618f< /Gmap_id><Date>1519349745963</Date>< Rate>

Brad helped us out a lot and was incredibly down to earth. I cannot say enough about his likeable demeanor and willingness to help. 5 stars to Brad!

Everything else about this place is so-so. Maybe they are short staffed, but with everyone except Brad, I felt in the way, a burden, and was constantly looking for them as they had "to attend to something" but in reality were making more deals and juggling multiple customers at a time. Alex (young one) and manager Tommy both did this to me.
2-3 stars to everything and everyone else.</text>

<text>Since moving to the bay area in 2013, I've taken my 2011 Elantra to be serviced by 2 dealers in the east bay. I'm afraid I did not receive quality service. I moved to Daly City in 2017 and soon enough the time came where I needed issues with my car to be addressed. I found Hyundai of Serramonte and brought my car in. I am happy to say that by far my best experience has been with this dealer. All issues were addressed without excuse and now my car drives like new! Thanks guys!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>In all fairness, I cannot speak to the car buying experience at Hyundai of Serramonte, and most people probably won't have the experience I did. But I believe my experience does speak to their customer service, or lack thereof.

I went for a test drive in a Sonata plug in hybrid last night. Before getting in the car, the salesman told me the gas engine kicks in whenever the car goes over 35 mph, which I'm pretty sure is not true. He then turned me over to another guy to take me on the test drive. When we got into the car, the low gas indicator was on and the battery gauge showed low charge. I asked him if we needed to put some gas in, and he said we would be fine.

So we drove for about 5 minutes, including about a mile on the freeway. When we got off the freeway, a bright Check Hybrid System warning came on. I again asked if we should find a gas station, and he said it shouldn't be a problem. As we started getting on the freeway to head back, the car wasn't accelerating properly and then it dropped out completely, about 3/4 mile from the dealership.

At this point, I found the whole situation rather amusing. I sat in the car on the freeway shoulder for about 15 minutes before finally asking the guy if someone was coming to pick us up. He said he couldn't get a hold of anyone at the dealership, but he called Hyundai (Blue Link, I think) and said a tow truck should be there in an hour. I told him I needed to get back sooner to pick up my daughter, so we both started calling the dealership again. I kept getting voicemail, so I decided to walk.

When I got back to the dealership, I asked the vultures (salesmen) standing in front if I could speak to a manager. They pointed at one guy who was a Sales Manager. I asked to speak to a store manager, since I figured they would want to know what happened. He went into the back to find one and never came back out. Another Sales Manager asked if he could help and I told him what happened. He apologized and asked if there was anything he could do. I told him to put gas in their cars for a start. But most importantly, I told him to make sure they can be reached, if not by customers, at least by their employees, in case of emergency. Needless to say, I won't be calling them again.<//text>< pics>

I haven't bought a car in a while, so I was not very excited about going to a dealership to get my car. At Hyundai of Serramonte, from the moment I walked in, the staff was very friendly and attentive. Zamir was great to work with. He really listed to what I needed and wanted and he was not pushy. They presented me with all the options, so  I can make the best decision for me. I highly recommend contacting Zamir if you are looking a for a car.<//Review>

<text>Had a 8:15 am appointment.  My vehicle didn’t even get in until after 10 am.  Way too long to wait.  I need gaskets and seals replaced due to a slow oil leak.  Finally after 12 noon they said they had to order parts and would call when they came in to reschedule another appointment.  Next time will take all day so I’ve requested a curtiousty vehicle.  Allan (the rep who signed me in was extremely helpful)
I’ve had a half dozen serious repairs done on my 2011 Tucson under platinum warranty (thank God I got it).  I know this car is a “lemon “ but I keep fixing until it’s right!  Thank you for your help and I’ll see you soon AGAIN.< /text>< Pics>

Simon Calimlim was an awesome sales person to work with. Car buying can be so stressful and he made me feel at ease.

I brought my car in about 9:10 Friday 10/05/208 and it was a white Hyundai Elentra and my car died and would turn back on so it was some sort of screw that was to small for my battery thing. Sorry not to good at the terminology!

Today's visit was a great experience not only because my car was fixed but one of the employees, ISREAL, had outstanding customer service. I was very impressed to walk in and see a young hard working gentleman have such great professionalism!

Keep it up ISREAL!

I yelped this review, as well!</Review>

I received RED CARPET SERVICE from Serramonte Hyundai who did a full diagnostic on my 2005 Elantra. They kept my car overnight. They detailed my car and provided shuttle service to me back and forth between their shop and my home. They prioritized a list for me of items that need afternoon. I couldn't be happier!</Text>

I took my car in for it’s 6000 mile oil change and unexplained slow leak in one of the new tires!  I picked it up with assurance that everything was in great working order!  The next day I was stranded on the highway with a dead engine!  Still waiting to hear what happened.......< /review>

Overall, a decent buying experience. They gave me a great quote on the car, however, it was a  lil bit of a hassle afterwards since they accidentally sold the car in the color I had requested. They did go above and beyond to make sure I did end up getting the car I wanted, however, the bottom of the front bumper was extremely scratched, resulting in me having to come down again to have them touch it up (which took a full day....). They also didn't get all the documents they needed in person, which resulted in me having to continue to send documents of my pay stubs, etc. A decent buying experience, could be improved<//text>

Long wait time. It takes few days for electronic repair such as blind spot monitor system, lane keeping assistance, etc. oil change is done at the same day.
Advisors seen pretty busy at all times. So not much customer service.
Took my car for repair, they called if they can get my authorization for road testing. I authorized. However I didn’t authorize they take my car to whoever was testing my car to home. They even used my fast trak at 6:40am. That’s something I would never authorize.<//review>

<Time>1521151422267< /Time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>Long wait time. It takes few days for electronic repair such as blind spot monitor system, lane keeping assistance, etc. oil change is done at the same day.
Advisors seen pretty busy at all times. So not much customer service.
Took my car for repair, they called if they can get my authorization for road testing. I authorized. However I didn’t authorize they take my car to whoever was testing my car to home. They even used my fast trak at 6:40am. That’s something I would never authorize.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>So far it has been very poor.  If I could rate 0 stars I would. Had tires on my 2015 Genesis recalled.   I scheduled an appointment several months ago...when I went in they said they did not have tires.   I went in a second time and same result. Two wasted days.  Finally got a call back two weeks ago  and they say they are on back order and would call me.   After 3 1/2 weeks no call back.  I now have almost 8000 miles on recalled tires.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>On my first visit for a recall I had an appointment set. But it wasn't honored an and my service was pushed several cars back along with the walk ins. I didn't mind they said they were busy. Take note that this was an appointment I made two weeks prior visit. For some reason I had a feeling that she didn't care that i had an appointment and my info is on the system and it shouldn't take long to upgrade the ecm to a new firmware (recall).. I later on confirmed that I was treated like a walk in..it was on the service invoice I received. I even asked her I had an appointment but she insisted that I cant be helped till later. What's the point scheduling an appointment then? Overall the ordeal took 7 hours.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Pros: Large inventory in stock of the car I was looking for (2017 Hyundai Tucson Limited). Easy to get to from the interstate. Very nice and well-informed salesperson - Fernando. I enjoyed my experience with Fernando but unfortunately he fell victim to the overbearing Sales Manager.

Cons: My goal was initially only to test drive the car. I was very up front about that. When I stated that I wanted to think about it, the Sales Manager was so pushy, I decided to leave because he wouldn't lay off if me. As I was leaving he screamed out "You'll be back. You'll see." Sheesh.<//text>

I prepared work materials to keep busy during the 3-hr app’t and drove 30 min to your place only to find out that the parts should have been ordered for the repair ahead of time and they weren’t. That was Friday, today is Wed and I haven’t heard back yet so now I’m going to have to call and find out what’s going on. I lost more than an hour out of my day Friday plus the gas and the hassle. I do not intend to buy another Hyundai.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>This review is long over due. We came in to trade our vehicle for a lease. -1 month later, we got a call from the dealership that THEY made a mistake on the paperwork and asked us to go back to review, resign, renegotiate monthly, go through the whole nonsense again...
-11 months later, we get a red flag that we have been sent to collections FOR THEIR MISTAKE, dropping our credit score way low...it took them over a month to fix! For the record, we set our payments up on auto to avoid late fees when we first signed our lease...why are we targeted for their lack of attention?
-While this was going on, we receive a text message from one of the staff members asking if we would like to consider buying the lease-ugh HELL NO. DONT BOTHER US ABOUT BUYING YOUR CAR WHILE YOU HAVEN'T EVEN FIXED A CURRENT ISSUE THATS AFFECTING OUR CHANCE TO GET A HOME!
Recently, we made an appointment to have "our car" serviced and it wasn't ready on-time. Instead, we were told the car would be ready on the next business day, which for us, is a work day too...this car is for work, we are actually leasing it for our business- we don't even own it--------yet,
-we were not accommodated a vehicle for the inconvenience
-we were not even offered a ride to and from the dealership
-learned there that the car was actually recalled, hence the check engine light turned on when its barely a year old, right?
-and we had to pay $30 for a tire rotation when its free at Costco.

Because we leased through this company is why we thought "bring it where we're leasing it". Never doing that again. Go elsewhere. Seriously. On the day we signed our lease, we were asked to write a good review. Thank goodness, we waited to share our true experience so that nobody else has to go through what we did. Next lease, we're going somewhere else where customer service is valued.</review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>3< /rate><text>Brought in my 2012 Hyundai Elantra to do the service campaign recall. Everything went smoothly - until it was time to pick up my car. The minute I drove out the driveway, a huge blast of smoke came out my exhaust pipe, causing my car to stall and shut down. Thankfully I was able to slowly pull over to the side. I was literally right next door and in front of Lexus of Serramonte.

I called the advisor who was helping me previously and told her about my situation. She sent 2 workers to come get me and my car to bring back to Hyundai. I was then told that they were sorry for leaving out the important part of this recall - smoke will come out and your car will experience hesitation. Never heard of such effect after a recall before.

Other than that, the mechanic who fixed my car afterwards was super helpful!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1516403181371, 'text': 'Hi Ronni, I am sorry that you had a bad experience.

I was impressed with the knowledge and concern of the salesperson, Mel, and the ability of the sales manager Tommy to "craft" a sales solution that we were both satisfied with. I highly recommend them.< /Review>

<Review>Extremely slow and unprofessional service. Was told it would take 1 hour to service my car, when it ended up being almost 3 hours. The initial appointment I made was for 4:00pm, only to be told when I arrived that they can't return your car the same day if your appointment is scheduled after 3:30pm. They said they are "still figuring out how to put that information on their website." After returning my car, the hood latch was detached and laying on the floor of my vehicle. Very disappointed.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

We just bought the Hyundai Ionic plug-in hybrid and had a very straight forward experience with Hyundai of Serramonte. We worked with Bernz and she was really candid, researched the things she didn’t know (rather than trying to just saying what we wanted to hear) and really listened to what our priorities were. There were some up-sells presented, but never pushed and we were able to see the numbers how we wanted them e.g., total cost, monthly cost, interest, etc. This was a pleasant car-buying experience, thanks Bernz!< /Review>

<review>Went in for two recall issues.  Greeted by a friendly customer service agent, registered the car for service and 5 minutes later, in the shuttle which took me on a 10 mile trip to my work.  They called me and said the work was done and at 5:09 (during rush hour), shuttle picked me up and delivered me back to the service center. Both drivers were friendly and engaged.  Made the commute a pleasure.  Car was in the drive ready to go, 1 minute to go over the service recommendations (didn't know I had an issue with my transaxle), grabbed my keys and went off in a car that had been washed.  Great service!  Prompt and friendly, what else could you ask for.<//review><Response>{'time': 1501796527738, 'text': "Thank you for the 5 stars Phil, we greatly appreciate it.

<Review>Hello, my name is Frank Sibillo.  I purchased a 2014 hyundai veloster last year after leasing the car for 3 years.   I need to contact you today because i am extremely dissatisfied with my experience with hyundai on every level of my experience.   After 3 years of leasing the car, I purchased it.    Because the sales office never communicated with the service center, the service center threw away all of my belongings that were in the car.   Some of those belongings were my deceased brothers belongings that i had been driving with for 20 years since his death.  I have nothing left of his now.   My further frustration is that when i purchased the car, i purchased a package with oil changes.  4 of them i believe.  Every single time i come in for one of my oil changes, the service center says they cant find the package and that i need to go to the sales center and find out the information.   My needs as a customer require that the communication between the service center and sales center be streamlined.  I shouldnt have to make phone calls and find information you guys should have. I spent 25k on my car.  I would think that is enough money to make hyundai make every part of my experience  a good one.  Last time i was here, they looked and looked, then found the package i bought and told me that i had oil changes still in my account.   Now i return for my next oil change and yet again, nothing in the system and yet again i have a representative telling me to go find the info hyundai should have.    The representative offered me a free oil change but i dont want a free oil change, i want to use the one i paid for.     (Oscar is a very nice man) Unfortunately,  i am so disappointed with the level of service i have received that after today, i will walk away from the package i bought and call it a loss on my part because i simply dont want to do business with hyundai ever again.   This has been an awful experience every way i look at it.   Ive lost extremely valuable belongings that cannot be replaced and then wasted money on a service package that hyundai wont honor because of bad paperwork.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1537037786164, 'text': "I am sorry that your experience here with us was not that great.

Victor & the Shuttle Driver: very nice, friendly, polite, on time ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

David: nice, he tries his best to help and accommodate.
1.) he said our car has 60K cover warranty and I I have 4K mileage left. So he said if I have some issues I better have them check, before it’s all gone. So I said ok can your guy check my cruise control I’ve been having issue ever since, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. He didn’t mention any labor fee charge before when i pick up the car he said he will charge me $37 fee for it, which is upsetting. I told him I don’t know anything about cars as long as it’s covered ok check it.

2.) When I spoke to my husband about it he said
I shouldn’t be charge for the labor since we already pay for the warranty and we have 100k mileage warranty we extended it, so we have plenty left.

3.) I asked how long will it take my car he said Atleast 3hrs, i was told when the car is done the office will call me. I left my car 10:30pm, I called 4ish to follow up and he said yes it’s done. Annoying that I had to call, I was at the mall 6hrs With my toddler waiting and if I didn’t call I would have missed the shuttle last pick up.

I think that part needs more improvement. So that’s why I’m giving ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ But staff all in all are nice and friendly.<//review>

I had my first maintenance for my 2016 genesis coupe with them few days ago, had asked for an oil change and asked to get a few minor things fixed, such as the driver seat belt being twisted. They did well on the maintenance and oil change but never did the minor factory faults that I pointed out. Also they detailed my car after but I would give the detail job a 7/10 because they didn't do a great job with the windows. Other than that it was an ok visit.</Review>

Hello, my name is Frank Sibillo.  I purchased a 2014 hyundai veloster last year after leasing the car for 3 years.   I need to contact you today because i am extremely dissatisfied with my experience with hyundai on every level of my experience.   After 3 years of leasing the car, I purchased it.    Because the sales office never communicated with the service center, the service center threw away all of my belongings that were in the car.   Some of those belongings were my deceased brothers belongings that i had been driving with for 20 years since his death.  I have nothing left of his now.   My further frustration is that when i purchased the car, i purchased a package with oil changes.  4 of them i believe.  Every single time i come in for one of my oil changes, the service center says they cant find the package and that i need to go to the sales center and find out the information.   My needs as a customer require that the communication between the service center and sales center be streamlined.  I shouldnt have to make phone calls and find information you guys should have. I spent 25k on my car.  I would think that is enough money to make hyundai make every part of my experience  a good one.  Last time i was here, they looked and looked, then found the package i bought and told me that i had oil changes still in my account.   Now i return for my next oil change and yet again, nothing in the system and yet again i have a representative telling me to go find the info hyundai should have.    The representative offered me a free oil change but i dont want a free oil change, i want to use the one i paid for.     (Oscar is a very nice man) Unfortunately,  i am so disappointed with the level of service i have received that after today, i will walk away from the package i bought and call it a loss on my part because i simply dont want to do business with hyundai ever again.   This has been an awful experience every way i look at it.   Ive lost extremely valuable belongings that cannot be replaced and then wasted money on a service package that hyundai wont honor because of bad paperwork.< /Review>

<Text>Erika Lyons was the initial contact salesperson.   Her demeanor and professionalism in the car sales industry is unmatched.  Very friendly, attentive abd personable.  I was at the dealership with mybekderly father who is not astute with technology and Erika took the time and patience to explain everything to him.  She was extremely helpful.   10 stars for her.  Ive bought alot of cars in my life, currently own 3 Hyundais myself (all bought in Roseville).  By far Erika was the easiest going of all employees Ive met.  Honestly, if it werent for her, Ive would have had my dad bought his Sonata at the Roseville dealership where I already have an existing relationship.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1537037674415, 'text': 'Thank you for a great review.

We just bought the Hyundai Ionic plug-in hybrid and had a very straight forward experience with Hyundai of Serramonte. We worked with Bernz and she was really candid, researched the things she didn’t know (rather than trying to just saying what we wanted to hear) and really listened to what our priorities were. There were some up-sells presented, but never pushed and we were able to see the numbers how we wanted them e.g., total cost, monthly cost, interest, etc. This was a pleasant car-buying experience, thanks Bernz!< /review>

Service is getting better.  It is important to make a reservation / appointment.  Although as a result of the closures in Burlingame and San Mateo, the Colma location is somewhat inconvenient for Peninsula residents.  BUT:  they do provide rather extensive shuttle service.  And I have yet to be overcharged for unnecessary parts or services.<//text>

Brought in my van for a wheel alignment as per the shop that I just purchased new tires fro.. the van. Pulled badly to the left. Unfortunately it wasn't until 2 months later that the van was brought In. After my wife had brought in the van i looked at the reciept. Test drive states no pulling at this time. They gave it a nive wash. Test drive and wash $128.00. Oh I forgot also got a multipoint inspection which stated I need power steering fluid. Coolant and transmission fluid. Strange I just had the whole rack and pinion replaced by this very same shop less than 1 year ago for $2k. Are you telling me you didn't put in fresh power steering fluid? And the transmission was serviced by a factory dealer less than. 3 years ago. Last time you get any work from me.😡<//Text>

< review>
Got ripped off , they sold me a car of 20,00 for 30,000 they said that they will help you but they don’t do it. They added me the car service and the car service doesn’t care when I went for my first car check. They just car for the money, the volume of my car didn’t work well and they told me that they fixed it. They just lie lie and lie.<//review>

Greeted by a friendly customer service agent, registered the car for service and 5 minutes later, in the shuttle which took me on a 10 mile trip to my work.  They called me and said the work was done and at 5:09 (during rush hour), shuttle picked me up and delivered me back to the service center. Both drivers were friendly and engaged.  Made the commute a pleasure.  Car was in the drive ready to go, 1 minute to go over the service recommendations (didn't know I had an issue with my transaxle), grabbed my keys and went off in a car that had been washed.  Great service!  Prompt and friendly, what else could you ask for.</text>< pics>

The worst possible experience you can have at a car dealership. They wasted my entire day by promising me before I came that they would honor a price from another dealership, and after I picked out the car exactly, had everything set up and was ready to write a check, they refused to give me that price. I was called a liar (even though I had proof) and I was even told that the previous price they had given me was a lie! It was insane. They told me to go to the other dealer that was a bit further away to get that price so I said "okay, now I want to file a complaint because you lied to me and wasted my entire day", and then they sent some other incredibly aggressive and rude sales manager over who tried to negotiate with me again (yet wouldn't give me the price agreed to). When I said he was wasting my time, he said "I'm going $700 under MSRP so I'm buying your time for $700!" - what kind of logic is that?! You're still $1000 over the price we agreed to prior to me coming back in! They are so rude and illogical. It was the worst car buying experience I could have imagined. I love Hyundai, my family has bought several Hyundai's over the past couple years, and my next purchase after the Elantra was the Sonata, and yet that's how I get treated when I go in?! Unacceptable. Never go here. It's not worth it. Drive another 30 minutes and get some decent service that isn't pure lies and manipulation. I gave the manager a chance to fix this (because every business deserves a chance to make up for awful employees) after it happened yesterday, and he said he'd look into it but I never heard back. It's just crazy how little they care about how they treat people.<//review>

Their parts department is weak and pointless,
I went in looking for touch up paint, the guy in the counter seem like he was just unhappy and miserable at his job. I asked if he had the paint for this tucson, gave him a whole vin, he said it needed to be order, and it will take 2 weeks to get here, i placed the order and offer to pay for it on the spot, he said i will pay at pick up, they will call me when it gets in, is been about a month and no call from them. I wish there was another hyundai dealer near by, i guess i will check san jose for better results, stay away from this place.<//text>

I'm very disappointed with Hyundai of Serramonte. I knew exactly what car I wanted, and how much I wanted to pay for it. I texted with the sales guy before I came in and then still spent 3 hours with him while he tried to negotiate with the finance guy. The only hiccup was my trade-in. I was asking for the Bluebook value, to which the finance guy then said there was a discrepancy on my Carfax. But the Carfax report noted that this one problem entry could have been a typo. And the 20 other inputs in my Carfax showed that there was not a discrepancy. Then the finance guy tried to tell me that he could only give me a few hundred dollars for the car because of the discrepancy, and he'd have to sell it for parts, which is all a lie. Dealers bundle the cars into lots for auction, but it was irrelevant, my car didn't have a discrepancy. We were talking about an expensive car that I was going to buy, and this guy was lying about the value of my trade-in. So I left and went across the bay to Hanlee Fremont Hyundai and bought the exact car for exactly what I wanted to buy it for at Serramonte, and they confirmed that the error on my Carfax was common and not a discrepancy and that the value I was asking for my trade-in was correct. I will never go back to Serramonte Hyundai.<//Text>

We had a great experience leasing a new car here last week with help from a lovely salesperson by the name of Bernz. My partner and I walked in to look at some Kia Souls that we heard this dealership had on the lot, and we quickly became interested in the new 2018 Hyundai Elantra GT once we set our eyes on it. Bernz was very knowledgeable about the car and helped get us quick answers to all of our questions. She was very relatable, friendly, transparent and patient with us. We came back the next day for a test drive, and Bernz even showed up an hour early for her shift in order to be on site for us. We were extremely satisfied with the customer service and are happy to recommend this business (and Bernz) to our friends. I'd give it 5 stars, but we spent over 5 hours there and the majority of the time was waiting because they only had one finance person on site who was tied up with other customers ahead of us. Outside of that, great experience!</text>

<Review>Nope! Called to find out if they had a part for my 2010 Santa Fe- First time I called I was told that the computer was not working, took my number to call back- which he never did. I called back the next day and he told me they did not have the part- and could not get it. - that I should order it over the internet- I told him I had actually looked but did not know the part number- he said it was "right there on the internet"- offered to pass me along to service department.  hmmmmm so I called another dealer, who actually asked me the last 8 digits of my VIN number so he could look up the part- which the other dealer had so I went there (20 miles more) an purchased it.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Absolutely terrible. Made an online reservation for a safety recall on my vehicle 2 weeks before appointment. Drove all the way there to only have them tell me that they don't do those services on the weekends because they don't have the staff for that. Here is a thought why not CALL beforehand knowing that you see the recall service reservation come through online?! Waste of my time and all could've been reconciled with a thing called a telephone. Wish I could give 0 stars. Also the service location is different from the dealer and is almost impossible to find being behind another dealership with a sign the size of 9x11 piece of paper off serramonte blvd. Thanks for nothing.< /Review>< pics>

Unbelievable!!! Ok, wow where to begin here. I moved to South San Francisco about 8 months ago. I went to this dealership to purchase a car because rolling in a big passenger van is hell finding a parking space. So, I came to these guys looking for a good deal on a reliable vehicle. I found this 2003 BMW X5 and really liked it. I put $8000.00 cash down because I figured that my credit was not all that good. One
of the finance companies took my loan and it was all good. 7 Months later I still do not have my registration for the car. I did some snooping and found that they wrote in the wrong address that I had never lived and disregarded my actual mailing address and did not even put that down.

Today, I am idling in a parking lot waiting for my fiance to meet me and I noticed that my car was steaming. I shut the car down and went to look. What do you know? My radiator is leaking. I know I purchased a warranty on the car. When I called them they hung up on me and when I called them back they told me to just take it to a BMW dealership. I told them I called the dealership and they said that it would cost me $13-15 hundred dollars just to tear into it. This pissed me off because here I have a car with no registration, and now its busted up and im out a ton of money in the process!

Do yourself a favor, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE to purchase your car. These people are frauds and will say anything just to get your hard earned money! Poor customer service. Poor DMV administration skills. They do not honor any warranty you purchase from them!</Text>

Some dealerships are actually pretty good, some not.  Serrramonte is a NOT.

Could not reach by telephone any department to schedule a service on my Tucson which is only 2 months  old.

Finally made an appointment via computer only to arrive and find a dysfunctional and poorly managed service center in which I waited 15 minutes to be greeted. Was told (reminder......I made an appointment a week ago) it would take 1 1/2 hours to look at the car and another 2-3 hours for the repair (uhh.....i stated on the appointment the passenger door  latch was squeaky, not some larger unknown concern like  an engine light was  on).

Yikes!  Unnnnnnnprofessional. I will  look  for  another dealership.</Text>

This is my third car i bought from zamir and like the previous two expierences i felt no pressure and all over a smooth transaction. With Hash and Rick as Zamirs Manager and Phi as our Finance Manager we recommend these guys for your next purchase. Just ask for Zamir, and you'll have a good time.</Review>

He invited me to come and see the car, I was a bit hesitant, as the reviews of this place are abismal.... He said that it was a good day to get the car at a lower price "because it was raining and the day was slow".. guess what? I went, and he showed me a lower trim of the car I was looking for, and told me that one of their executives had taken the car I wanted out during the weekend. I told them that I needed that specific higher trim ,he apologized, and I checked a couple of different cars. He told me he would call me on Monday when he had the car I wanted back ... On Monday, he did not call me, answered my emails or texts. He simply just ignored me :-( .... A couple of days afterwards the car was not on their website.

very pushy aggressive... these people lie too much
every word coming out from their mouth is all bs

there sales manager tommy is biggest liar never explained what I was paying for untill i went over with my contract having cliget, warrenty and bunch of other stuff that cost more than 8k !!!!!

Do not ever buy from this guys I hardly disrecommand. They were focus on monthly payment and never went on the pricing for what I was paying...

I ended up purchasing from Capitol Hyundai they were very professional and honest

DO NOT GO IN TO THIS DEALERSHIP !!!!!!!!!!!</text>

Hyundai services treated my car very great! One of the workers helped me out a lot. His name is Oscar Gardillo. He really helped me out with getting my brake lights changed and helping me out with a situation i didnt really know. There was a wire that wasnt connecting on my brake lights and Oscar helped me out by ordering the car piece for me and the mechanics did it right away as soon as I dropped my car off. I recommend hyundai services a lot. They take good care of your car no matter what. Mahalo again hyundai🤙🏽</Review>

Bought a USED CAR. They told me my down-payment would be high. I had 7000 cash. They said that's good. So I trusted that. Then on top of that sold me extended warranty and gap insurance, (which later found out I don't need it because it dosent apply to me) and they marked up the price. Defenetlly never buying here ever. Only crooks and theives here. Avoid it or make sure u ask a real profesional to check everything. I could have gotten an brand new car with 7000 downpayment! And they didn't even mention that. I'm going with Toyota this time and I put 500 as downpayment. And my payments are the same as my used one. Wow. My mistake for trusting this place. But never again.</Text>

I've been meaning to review for a long time. The customer service is terrible. Also, the ongoing issue of front end noise with suspension problems was explained as a "loose tool in the trunk"
Yeah, no thanks.
Beware of this dealer and mechanic shop. They are unscrupulous.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>1) When booking an appointment, was told there was a shuttle available to drive you the office and pick you up. When arriving for the appointment, was told a shuttle would only drive you to a location but NOT pick up.

2) was told 3pm estimated completion. Texted at 2pm to see if it was on-time. No reply. Called at 2:30pm and left vm.  No reply.  A friend was driving me as a favor (since there was no loaner or shuttle), so I could not have him on-call indefinitely. I just had him drop me off at 3:30pm.
Car was not done until 5:15pm. I never did receive a reply to my text or phone call.

3) car smelled like cigarette smoke when I got into the car. Very unprofessional.

Overall not a pleasant experience for my first time at this dealership.</Text>< pics>

<review>Absolutely 100% horrible service!! I called 9 hours before coming to this business to inform them I wanted to look at a car that I would like to buy if all checked out. I told Bernz, the saleslady that I live 5 hours away and that I would be trading my car in for the down payment and having my dad co sign because I have a good credit score but just not very long credit history. we stayed in contact through text the whole drive down to Colma CA. When I arrived at the dealership that night I was told that the car needed a new power steering and I could not take the car for a few days. I was not informed this before when I called NINE hours ahead.

Since I drove all that way I decided to trade my car in and start the buying process and just come back in a few days to pick up my new car. they said they will give me a loaner car but then came back and said they will loan my own car back to me for the few days. I declined and just drove home with my dad. A week goes by and I get a text saying the car will be ready by Friday. I ask about the loan and she says to call the financial guy. I do and he said he couldn't get my loan approved with mine and my dads name so he just put it in my dads. I inform him that this is not ok seeing as how it is my car. He said he would call me back and never did. the next day I tell the saleslady that we wont be coming until the financial office calls us with the details. never got a call!!! we decided after TWO weeks of not having a car and not getting any information out of them or being able to get ahold of them on the phone, that we would drive down there and take my old car to a different dealership.

On our way down we stopped at a different dealership and got approved for the same car (a year younger with more miles) right away with a 5.4% interest rate. The amazing salesman Joel drove me to this other dealership to pick up my old car to trade in. When we walked in the manager said I already bought a car and kicked the sales man out. I then found out that they are SISTER STORES. I try to get my car back and they said I signed a contract. I informed them of this horrible experience (again) and they say they got both our names on it just for a interest rate that was high then the original 8.9%!!! While I am basically being help hostage and getting a run around, they have someone go tell the salesman that drove me there that if he didn't leave the property he would be arrested. they wanted him to leave me there!!! His manager told him to tell me to leave with him and they would deal with the old car themselves since they are owned by the same person!!

I dealt with over 5 different people at Hyundai Serra Monte and it was the worst car buying experience ever!! I am so thankful for the sister store that helped me out. I would rate this with a negative star if I could. would never ever recommend this company. so very shady! Can never get any real answers and very rude! horrible communication and even worse costumer service. This place should not be in business.<//review>< pictures>

Public Service Announcememt: The parts and service center for this dealership is by far the worst I have ever experienced. I dropped off my car at 1pm for a recall and was told that it would be done by 3:30pm on that same day (Saturday). They called me at 4:45pm right before closing time to tell me that my car was not only NOT done, but I would have to pick it up two days later on Monday morning. I have plans tonight and would be without a car for Sunday and a way to get to work on Monday without paying for an Uber out of my own pocket for their negligence and inability to do their jobs on time. I called management and their Service Manager said I can pick up my car....without my service on my car being completed. REALLY? Because that would solve ALL my problems. First and LAST time here.

I hope this is a warning for you all.<//text>

Not helpful at all, seems like they are trying to get every dollar out of the customer they can. Not how normal Hyundai dealerships act. Customer service is terrible and they do not accommodate the customer in any way. Never coming back to this dealership.< /text>

Not helpful at all, seems like they are trying to get every dollar out of the customer they can. Not how normal Hyundai dealerships act. Customer service is terrible and they do not accommodate the customer in any way. Never coming back to this dealership.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I am very happy with you. I have a long time to take my cars to his workshop because my first visit was a beautiful experience, I was very well attended by Mr. Óscar Delgadillo and the attention he had with me was the best, From that day I have not visited another place, I have been visiting them for years and I congratulate them because all the team of workers have the same goal of customer satisfaction and in the end the customer is the main support of the economy of any company. Congratulations.
