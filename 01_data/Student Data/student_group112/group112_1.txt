Friendly staff. However, there was one employee who doesn’t wear a mask and was serving customers. No other employees saw it as a problem. As a result, I don’t really trust their covid protocol.

The food is ok. We feel it’s not salty enough. Good price though.

Overall, it’s not a bad choice but I wouldn’t recommend it.< /Text>

<date>1617831773733< /date><Rate>4</Rate><Text>I loved watching the movie 🎥 " Crazy Rich Asians". No, not for the rom-com storyline, but  the scene where Golding takes Wu to the Newton Food Centre aka "Newton Circus" and orders food from the various hawker stalls!  Made me drool and crave Singaporean food!   A mix of delicious food influenced by Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Malay and Portuguese.

Killney Kopitiam (Palo Alto), has a good selection of tasty Singaporean food. Reasonable prices and good service. Can I be on the cast of "Crazy Hungry Asians"?🤣< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUKsVACHN7OlXz_u_FdNug37jtMFNNAX-2hpXd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPj9xZTZb6vYzAtk94DmySvILbBz5TMhAhFmETX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqUpKBAW9FaQYuSrLKvHECj5D20fAxQti5VwEs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObYPAg_XEsXm9HbODBS0Ec_1zLRiyMZkV4EydU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq_TWWyjo3eqdiGbe7SyVdE7zNa14VhJGYuTw0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMginltPR8h5UibJw4BtsugBCSNx1-my0lSyDtu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyolUOIDa15ZfAYZc2bPn3KWGRRoV_T4HQiE7V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3Dkfq6OrAutBpV5JkNZnZBfllfhabrMWzLhzp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcSfnSHam-V7tD0GYoHovF0lXqvEN5rVS9dW02=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVyzl1wSN7d976IL2H8P_NT8VshAa5uDmDOAAl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

< review>
Impressions from 3 Singaporeans:
- Kaya toast was legit.
- Teh was OK. Not enough tea flavor, but at least it wasn't bitter, which happens if it's over-steeped. Could also taste the condensed milk.
- Nasi lemak: Rice tasted like coconut milk but was also far too sweet. I still enjoyed it though. Sambal and the other ingredients were mostly legit.
- Prata: they put spring onions on it for some reason, which overpowered the flavor of the prata.

Overall a relatively decent attempt at Singaporean food, considering the dearth of other good Singaporean restaurants.</review>

Food was very authentically Singaporean (I'm Singaporean) and tastes great. Nasi Lemak had a good amount of coconut milk, and the Chicken Rice chicken was prepared very well.

A small complaint is that the Char Kway Teow was a bit too oily.<//review>

The Food
If you ever looked for Singaporean food in the bay area, you might realize Killiney Kopitiam is a popular choice. Probably also the closest genuine choice? (Don't get it confused with Kopitiam Cafe in Milpitas though.) I've been there a few times and compared it a bit to my experience in Singapore. Here's also some dishes I've tried
- Yuan Yang (w/Tea & Condense Milk)
- Kaya Toast
- Nasi Lemak
- Laksa
- Char Kway Teow
Most of the selection is pretty good, though I would say they are missing a bit of flare when compared to Singapore. But they still taste good with nice flavors. I would like to go back and try some of their other selection like Bak Kut Teh and Chicken and Rice. Whenever I go to Singapore, I must get Chicken and Rice!

The Miscellaneous
Killiney Kopitiam is on one of the main streets, but there is a decent amount of street parking. They seem to have opened recently, but haven't got a chance to use their inside, cause pandemic. They have takeout or outdoor seating, though your mileage may vary. They have a pretty good selection on their menu, covering most of the Singaporean dishes. Their service is also pretty friendly and sincere.</text>

<Review>Finally get the chance to try famous Singapore Killiney Kopitiam and I have mixed reviews. The customer service and staff are very friendly and ensure that you order fast and get your meal ASAP. I only tried mee siam and it was just so so since I have tasted better at home or back in Singapore.  I wish to give them 5 stars but the kopi C have so much room for improvement. It was diluted coffee and does not have any taste at all. The kaya toast was ok and they should not get that wrong 😊<//Review>< Pics>

Refer to their website for more updated opening hours for pick-up. Laksa tasted lemak and sambal has a kick. I'd prefer more taucho in the Mee Siam, but that's just me. Had it the next day, just like in Singapore, for breakfast. Garlic noodles was surprisingly sedap, the parmesan did that. Would go back again when laksa craving hits.<//text>

Authentic and tasty Singapore food! Loved the ice tea kaya toast and Bak Ku Teh!

I grew up in Singapore and now live in Palo Alto so it’s great to be able to find a Singaporean restaurant so close by.

The wait is a bit long but each time I went they did their best to serve as best as they could.

Great experience overall and I would highly recommend!<//review>

<user>109335992756924141039</user><Review>Singaporean food is one of those cuisines that is usually way better in the country of origin. It's got a "little of this, little of that" feel that's tends to result in overdone, overwrought dishes. The solution - bring the country to you! The dishes at Killiney Kopitiam are restrained and delicious.
Just be aware that as soy sauce is to chinese cooking and fish sauce to vietnamese and thai, is shrimp paste to singaporean... It might take a bit of getting used to, but the laksa is addictive once you're there!< /Review><Name>Anand Hattiangadi</Name><time>1615666019508</time><response>None</response>< Rating>

<Review>Love this new restaurant! The iced tea with condensed milk is amazing. I got the nasi lemak and mee rebus and they both tasted like the ones I had in Singapore before - kudos to the team and chef for being able to replicate the dishes here in Palo Alto without compromising the authentic taste of the food. Prices were reasonable too.

Also, I have to say the service crew is polite and friendly, while observing social distancing and keeping the place clean, neat and sanitized.

Highly recommend. Will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.</Review>< userid>

Mind you, there is no monolithic version of various Singaporean dishes and every restaurant has its own rendition, but I like Killiney's versions in Singapore and here. I seldom write reviews but felt compelled to do this one.

Stepping into the restaurant to place my order brought a tear to my eye, as the place smelt like a proper Singapore food court / Kopitiam (Coffeeshop) with its mixed aromas of Kopi (coffee), teh (tea), toast etc. I ordered several dishes: Roti Prata, Chicken curry, Mee Siam, Mee Rebus, Mee Siam, Seafood Bee Hoon, even iced Teh-C Siew Dai (tea with evaporated milk and less sugar). Tastes just like what I've eaten at the original Killiney Kopitiam(s) in Singapore. Tastes like home.

Mee siam:
Gravy tastes just like what Kiliney's sells, which is a bit in the thicker side of the spectrum of what one can find in Singapore, with more tamarind flavour and less coconut milk. The Bee Hoon (rice vermicelli or 米粉) is a bit thicker but that's consistent with Bee Hoon in general here.  That's mostly just texture anyway, the flavour is great. They even have chives and thin sliced tau kwa, which really completes it.

Mee rebus:
Tastes great, again just like what Killiney sells in Singapore. I prefer my mee rebus with a bit more ground nuts but that's just me. Certainly an authentic mee rebus. Not something I've really ever seen in any other restaurant here. Make sure you finish it with the provided kalamansi limes for max flavour! Could be enhanced even further with a drizzle of Kecap manis (dark sweet soy sauce) and julienned green chillies.

Char Kway Teow:
Pretty good, but somewhat lacking in wok hei (the blend of flavours emerging from the Maillard reaction and smoke as a result of rapid high heat wok cooking). The Kway Teow (thick rice noodles) was rather thicker than what one would typically get in Singapore, but had a good flavour.

Seafood Bee Hoon:
Highly recommended, better than their Char Kway Teow imho. Balance of flavours is good and the chef fried it well with some decent wok hei. Make sure you eat this piping hot for max effect.  Transported me back to a zi char (cooked food) stall in a Singapore Kopitiam.

Chicken curry:
Really good Nyonya style curry, more Singaporean-tasting than any other version I've eaten at any restaurant here. For the less initiated, this is quite different from Thai yellow curry or Jndian curries. I was hoping for a larger portion though, this is essentially an individual-sized portion, essentially one chicken drumstick and potatoes. Tastes just like what Kiliney sells. And it's actually different from curry sauce provided together with the Roti Prata. Killiney in Singapore sells the base sauce in foil packs for home cooks, and they should do so here too! (*hint hint Mr Woon*)

Roti Prata:
Tastes fragrant and light like a Kopitiam roti prata. Shiok and Indo restaurants in Menlo Park and Palo Alto make good roti pratas too, and Indo's may be a bit crispier than the one I got at Killiney. That could be because it was a bit cold by the time I brought Killiney's home. Killiney's also much cheaper than Indo's, $6 vs $9.

Mr Woon, the owner of the Killiney franchise in Singapore, is Hainanese, and the Killiney Kopitiams are typical Hainanese kopitiams. The Hainanese migrants to Singapore established themselves as formidable cooks serving under British colonists, and their cooking is a blend of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Western flavours (just like the melting pot of Singapore). This is reflected in the dishes on offer at Killiney (e.g. chicken curry - blend of Chinese/Malay/Indian, Hainanese pork cutlet - blend of Western/Chinese). Interesting factoid: many of Mr Woon's family members went to Stanford, so there's a Palo Alto connection here.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN38Q8i4VVjQjRVgnujBjW_UZADq4rRq967E6o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2IuudvKbidZuM_PwfS64HeF1uTnsZ4bLBNFo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNChrl8V4wXijykGUC91coWqQoT2wtZRuwhIX8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHMDTjjcCoaqBKtX7II4B29QJE7elEPacbGE4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoS19GfDQ26SPXVZRGiD8Rs_Ivkq7JA48v8CU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG6pL-edbZ6j4IDj4fG832B8ZEGUWlAQ2DDsU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Their Char Kway Teow is authentic.

While the upfront cost ($12.99) seems high, it was exceptionally filling and tasty (i.e., you more than get your money's worth). The Kway Teow was on par with what I had in Singapore. Will be back again.< /Text>

I live in the neighborhood and have been waiting months for the restaurant to open. I arrived at 7:52 and was turned away. The cashier said last call is 7:45 . I was not dining in, and the couple in from of me was still at the register ordering. The sign posted outside reads open until 8:00pm.
The cashier was not even apologetic.
I give an F for customer service.  I have actually had better service in Singapore .< /Text>

I've been wanting to check out this kopi tiam ever since they opened up, but only got a chance to do it yesterday. I've been to their original location, and although it's not as good as the ones in Singapore, I think their food and coffee are still pretty good, and definitely satisfy my cravings.

I ordered kaya toast, hainanese chicken rice, and kopi peng (iced coffee with condensed milk). I really enjoyed them all, and the chicken rice is comparable to the one I used to get in Singapore. The coffee was also good, but the kaya toast felt a bit off. I'm not sure how to put it, as it's not bad, but it just doesn't feel the same as the one I usually get.

The food is a bit pricey, but still worth it. When I was working in Singapore, I go to Killiney or other kopi tiam branches almost every day in the morning before work. Safe to say I won't be doing that here, even if it's close to my place.

All in all, it's definitely good enough to satisfy my craving for kopi team, something that the bay area has been missing all this time. I will definitely come back (just not too often).<//text>

Was told at the counter there’s a 40 minute wait time for soft boiled eggs!!😆. The Kopi-o was nothing like it is supposed to be. No trace of condensed milk. Waited 30 minutes for a cold kaya toast. If you’ve been to the original in Singapore they would serve it all hot in 3 minutes.< /Review>

<Text>Authentic Singaporean cuisine. Things are spicy enough to have a 'kick'. Nasi lemak and Laksa were both good or Shiok as we would say.

There's about 5 indoor dining tables for 3-5 seats per table on first floor. And another 6 outdoor tables. Parking (next to Taipan) and tables weren't too busy at 11am on a Sunday but fills up by 12pm. There's a constant stream of people ordering every few minutes and many are doing takeout.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMgdSCE0YtDLE-2F2NMw_gbYUFtNcbzDfEZpGK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<text>ordered delivery. lived in Singapore for 9 years and, as many others have posted, this place is pretty spot on, a little taste of home

char kway teow - missing the oysters but otherwise the flavors are on point

hainanese chicken rice - solid. like that all 3 sauces are provided instead of 1 or 2 like most places do. rice and chicken could've been more fragrant but its better than most places around here

curry puff - never had a sweet potato one in Singapore so this was a bit weird for me but it was good

laksa - maybe a little thin but still great tasting<//text><Time>1606667306861<//Time>< response>

What? Broken rice for chicken rice??? Since when was that a feature in Singapore or Malaysia? I love to make money too, and I know PA or MV do not have diners that were on SE Asia recently. But this is daylight robbery, and frankly embarrassing.  You no not represent the best of Singapore or wherever.</review>

Had the nasi lemak. Pretty good- though it would be nice if the sambal is more spicy ;)

Wanted the Hainanese pork chop but it wasn't available.

No queue on Friday after 1pm.

<text>Amazing authentic food!!!! I haven't had such authentic Singaporean food since leaving the country 15 years ago. The laksa, nasi lemak and chicken rice are all authentic and delicious. In particular the chicken rice has excellent tender juicy chicken that is vastly superior to other Hainanese chicken rice places. The rice is rich and fragrant with chicken oil and the soup is delicious as well. The laksa comes with some exquisite prawns of excellent texture. The broth is decadent and flavorful. The nasi lemak is also competently prepared, with perfect chicken wings and delicious rice.< /text><GmapID>0x808fbbc825183607:0xe6cb3ab95cbe9a4d<//GmapID><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQn0eRtc0-4y_iIxrNn5IFWOueVDVQCXmnzt0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Date>1602394285930< /Date><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

5 stars for the food/staff and 4 for the wait.
Very good, authentic Singaporean food at reasonable prices for downtown Palo Alto.

Would recommend the nasi lemak and laksa. We wanted to try the bak kut teh and char kway teow but they were out of those dishes by the evening. Get there earlier for lunch if you want to avoid this!

We waited about 40 minutes for our order and the staff seemed really apologetic about the wait. Seems like they are still figuring things out and I hope they can have a system to notify us when our order is ready (text, email), since we wouldn't mind the wait as much if we could walk around downtown.

Will definitely come back and try again when ordering is a bit easier!</text>

Came here to try out the Singaporean favorites but was very disappointed as all the best menu items were not available including kaya toast, curry puffs etc.</Text>

Waited in line for half an hour and waited 40 more minutes for food. I don’t think it is because of weekend, the speed of order and service is so slow!!!<//text>

<text>The customer service was great. My family & I haven't been to a Baskin-Robbins in years so it was a nice treat after taking care of other errands in that area. It was sooo hot that day, my chocolate cone in a cup melted on me as soon as I got in the car..lol..so on extremely hot days make sure to grab napkins :)< /text>< userid>

Just to clarify for some people that review this Baskin robins doesn't receive anything from postmates or doordash to make ahead Everything is made when the person from post mates or doordash arrives.  That way it's fresh. Hope this helps some people.</review>

Friend ordered some stuff from postmates and the store held the order for over 30 mins put a drink in a bag rather than a tray and poor driver didn't know and probably has a stain in her car and made a mess in my house cuz the bag dripped everywhere. WTF!</text>

< Review>
I acquired the best dentist I could ever imagine when he took over my previous dentist’s practice, a long long time ago. He is kind, attentive, patient and does excellent work. I have stuck with him all these years and he helped me get all amalgam silver (mercury) fillings out and replaced. And has been great resurfacing area that no longer had good contact. I feel blessed to have had consistently great experiences with him as my dentist after having terribly traumatic painful experiences as a kid and developing dental-work phobia. Philip Fletcher is  delightful dentist and his staff are amazing too. Dedicated and sweet people. I have relaxed there knowing I am in good hands and my teeth will be tended to quite well and painlessly.<//Review>

Best dental referral ever. Have been with Dr. Fletcher 13 years. My recent visit was a post-COVID19 first.  The attention to safety protocols was impressive and reassuring.  Lying in the chair was surreal, almost therapeutic because it was so 'normal'. Teeth were cleaned, oral cancer checks were performed, dental health was checked. Over the years, our family's experience has been that Dr. Fletcher always puts patient well-being first.  Highest recommendation< /review>

I've been going to Dr. Fletcher for 6 years and he has been a phenomenal dentist. Dani is a fantastic hygienist and has helped me keep my teeth clean and improve my overall dental health. Where it is routine cleanings or a crown or filling I would highly recommend Dr. Fletcher's practice to anyone.<//text>

I have been coming here for years but this was my first visit since COVID-19 procedures were put in place.

I would have never thought it possible but I feel even safer now than I ever did before. As soon as I walked into the office and proceeded to my chair I could immediately smell how much cleaner the air was in the office. It was a relaxing and reassuring sensation.

Everyone was still as respectful and accommodating as ever and clearly safety protocols are at the top of their priority list. Good job guys!

Two thumbs up for Dr Fletcher and company! 👍👍😀‼️</Review>

<Review>I have gone to this dental practice for many years.  When I moved out of the area, it only took two dental cleanings for me to decide to come back to this wonderful dental office.  They have done a very careful and thoughtful way to  bringing back patients with this covid19 pandemic. It sure makes me feel very confident to continue my coming back for care.<//Review><rating>5</rating>< gmap_id>

<text>My mouth has suffered from "military dentistry" for much of my life, so I put up with an awful lot.  I don't think that I've ever heard of someone who ENJOYED going to have anything done.

That said, and in the midst of the shelter-in-place, I had a crown come off (from another dentist so long ago that I don't even remember the procedure, much less the dentist).  My wife has said great things about Dr Fletcher, and when she heard about my crown, she called his service. I expected to have to wait months, but he responded to me right away.

He agreed to come into his office and do the repair.  Not only that, but he explained what he was doing.  As my wife and others have said, he has a great chair-side manner, and I have found my new dentist..<//text>< Pics>

Dr Fletcher is extremely personable and has a great sense of humor. He takes the time to educate you clearly on your oral situation in a manner that is very easy to understand. This is a phenomenal practice and I would not go anywhere else.</Review>< pictures>

They are the best. If you are looking for a skilled, honest, friendly dentist, give them a call. Dental hygienists are all so very good, receptionists are so understanding and accommodating.

<Review>One if the best dental office in the Bay Area as far as I'm concerned. Everyone in the office is professional, kind, courteous and they are always happy to help. Dr. Phil is very thorough/open in his explanation based on what he sees from your X-rays. His estimated time on the procedure is nearly on point all the time. Very cautious and conscience if you feel any discomfort while they are working on your teeth. I wish I could say that for the last few dentists I had seen in the past. I'm staying with him till I lose all my teeth!!</Review><rate>5<//rate>< resp>

They are always friendly, thorough, professional and very knowledgeable. Definitely go the extra mile for their patients. In particular, they are well-trained on COVID-19 protocols.< /text>

<Text>I can't say enough good things about Dr. Phillip Fletcher. His practice is in Palo Alto and he has been amazing with my special needs 3 year old as well as my formerly dental-phobic 11 year old. As a father of 4 kiddos himself (he has pictures on the walls), he is excellent with children and works wonders to ease adults as well. He also did the most thorough oral cancer exam I've ever had as part of his new patient protocol. His technology is state of the art, and you don't wind up paying extra for it. His staff is also easy to work with and his dental hygienist my daughter actually asked for by name the next time around. His whole team makes every effort to make every visit as easy and pain-free a process as possible. Also you can actually make an appointment request online and someone will call you back to schedule. That's perfect for tired mom's like me who often don't think about things like making appointments for myself until after my kids are down. :)< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Dr Fletcher has been amazing to our family!  He is so warm and welcoming.   We have three young children all under the age of seven and it's hard to wrangle them all to get their teeth cleaned. Dr. Fletcher has bent over backwards to accommodate us, making it easy for us to come.   My son grinds his teeth and chipped one of his molars. Dr Fletcher did a gorgeous job repairing it. The kids love him and the treasure chest they get to choose a prize out of. He is so fair on pricing and the best dentist I've ever encountered! I couldn't recommend him more.< /Review>

< Review>
I think a sign of a good dentist is having a lot of hi-tech gadgets.  Not that the gadgets necessarily make for good dentistry, but I figure that if the dentist is worried about spending time and money to be on the leading edge in technology, they're likely also doing the same to be on the leading edge in dental practices.  Since I'm not a dentist and have no idea what the latest and greatest is in dental practices, I look instead for the tech (which I do know a little about!)

Dr. Fletcher has some great equipment.  Flat screen monitors everywhere, even over my head as I lie in the chair.  A digital X-Ray machine which immediately shows my teeth on that flat screen monitor over my head!  An optical digital camera he uses to show me what the new filling looks like!

What's more, Dr. Fletcher and his staff are really friendly.  I was waiting in the lobby this morning with my kids while my wife was getting a filling, and mentioned to the receptionist that I thought I had lost a filling recently.  She got me in for a same-day afternoon appointment to have Dr. Fletcher look at it.  When he heard about it, he told her he might as well have a look at it immediately--save me some time since I was waiting there anyway.  They let my kids come in and sit and watch (since they otherwise would have been unattended), and they entertained them while they waited.  They found the lost filling and repaired it in about 15 minutes.  Fantastic experience!< /Review>

<Text>The facility was gorgeous!  Very clean, well organized and laid out in a manner that kept you busy while their expert staff worked their magic on your bike.

Had the opportunity to interview Shasta about the Vintage Monkey not once, but twice, a few years ago. It's amazing how much things changed between our first two interviews and how much they continue to evolve. Extraordinary people building an extraordinary place. Keep up the great work.</review>

Pretty tasty pizza! We got the gourmet garlic chicken and it definitely delivered with the garlic. The crust was thin and crispy and it tasted like eating a fresh baguette, which was a nice surprise! This place is family owned and run and they were very friendly people.</Review>

After Fremont, Milpitas and surroundings are my new areas of exploration. So last night I explored this Pakistani/indian Halal restaurant in Santa Clara. Their specialties are Pizza, Pasta and Burgers. They also serve Chops, Wings, Breads and Salads. I tried Pizza in Supreme flavor. Pizza was well topped and rich in taste. Crust was also awesome. So i decided to add burger, pasta and wings in my wishlist and will try in future in shaa Allah. The guy on the counter was humble enough to gave me details about the food i wanted to know. Right now dining in is closed due to Covid.<//text>

You can order online or call in.  Slice and Postmates works and they take credit cards.  It's a take out place with parking up front.  The pizza tasted great and was loaded with toppings really well.  They can make the pizza the way you want it if you want to drop or add things that is.  Limited options of drinks available.

<Review>I absolutely loved this place ! Not only is it halal, but the portion sizes are huge and the owners are very friendly. I also appreciate that they are a family run business.

I ordered a diablo pizza and a garlic chicken pizza from them during Ramadan. While I had to wait a bit for my pick up, they ensured that I had dates, water and samosas for free to break my fast. How thoughtful is that!

I thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas : the diablo one had halal pepperoni (I think it’s lamb or beef) and turkey bacon. I had never really had anything like this before and absolutely loved it. The garlic chicken was cheesy and finger licking good. I liked that they gave complimentary red chilli flakes and grated Parmesan.

Definitely going to go back and try their other flavors. Wish them the best.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgqvB1sNR_aXx37Lz7TGGVQjSAN73ZKMxzLuMK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwNGxqAXqsDuf1MDzWmiKUuiRsB-pEX1353CW5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQf5r8Fc0F0N7nCa9rXxIJvWSXh1dPLzrEgMcj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt74xa47pEPLMj7Ll59K0omRdMzjlrLNe0poWu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJcYN61JcPYcAxUUPFO61N1QraicMU0-PNuw-O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>{'time': 1590998046386, 'text': 'We really appreciate your feedback.

Slice has them as “Krusty”. Anyway the pizza is decent, the crust tastes chewy. The pizza didn’t come soggy. They didn’t skimp on toppings.</review>

Simply amazing.  All their food (Pizza, burgers and wings) are cooked fresh and high end. All 4 flavors of their wings are worth trying.  The family that owns and runs is this place is super nice, friendly and goes above and beyond to provide superb customer service. I love supporting them and coming back.  I have also tried their Nihari which is part of their special Indian food weekendmenu which is great as well. I'm just afraid that I'm now getting addicted to this awesome place lol !!<//review>

I just ordered another time today and the quality was just as good.  What stands out is the quality of toppings (amount and even spread almost till the edges).  Other places leave a bit to a lot more bread at the edges that aren't covered with toppings. So if you don't like eating plain pizza bread you'll appreciate this kind of pizza.< /Text>< Time>

They always seem to mess up my order. It's either burned, under cooked, or missing items the wings are also very inconsistent. Worst fast pizza the best one out of all hands down is on 17th and Julian in san jose<//Review>

Love this authentic 🇸🇻 Salvadoran food! Pupusas pupusas pupusas , this place is old school if you are a fancy butt and want kiss butt. Get out of town with that flashy attitude if you want good food made and prep by genuine people here is another spot to add to the collective, the hot habanero salsa is on point the loroco pupusas are great, horchata awesome you can call ahead if you dont like to wait or get take out.. Only CASH repeat Only CASH. They had card before idk what happend. Peacefull quite place yes bring the family they will love it.. I know mines does.</text>

<review>two days ago was our first time in this fine restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the attentive service, with the magnificent  dishes and booze and with the decent payment. We will definitely visit there in a short time.< /review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Aly's Restaurant Familiar is an excellent place to savor the best dishes with the original flavor of the best Salvadoran Gastronomy, you will have the privilege of being served with courtesy, respect and kindness, but the most important thing is the tasty dishes that they prepare at the moment you order them, you will find dishes from our beautiful land, which will hardly be served anywhere else in the San Fernando Valley. I recommend this place, I frequent it with my friends and I invite you to visit this fabulous place, where the most demanding palates are satisfied, They will leave with a smile from ear to ear, full of happiness. I give it an AAAAA !!!!

Recomiendo este lugar,  lo frecuento con mis amigos y los invito a que visiten este fabuloso lugar, donde los paladares más exigentes, son satisfechos,  Saldrán con una sonrisa de Oreja a oreja,  llenos de felicidad.  Le doy una AAAAA!!!!</Review>

<Text>Shady, corrupt preorder system for new consoles. Was told lies about preordering when I put down deposit. Then told lies that they weren’t getting a second wave when Microsoft did send out another wave and then they changed stance and said they were probably only online and my preorder deposit wasn’t a preorder. Left the store extremely upset< /Text>< Pictures>

Called about going to the store tomorrow for preordering the series x. They told me dont bother coming in all there consoles are already spoken for. I said how preorders don’t go up until tomorrow. They have been taking people’s money for preorders for months to hold them spot for one. Shady back door business.< /review>

I have always been a fan of GameStop. Only thing I was not happy about is 10 games I wanted, they did not have in stock. They even had the games on the shelf, but not in stock<//review>

I use to go there so much everyone knew my name and was always happy to see me. Now I get happy greetings but it's more about what they can try to push on me and less of the genuine happiness to see me. It pushed me away from going here, I miss the old way of doing things</Text>

Sometimes you get good service other times you don't. I didn't have a bad experience until the last 6 mths or so. Now I don't want to go in there. Very rude and had friends hanging out and being very arupt and loud. Not sure if that person or those still work there and don't have their names but I don't go there unless I have to now.<//text>

The store doesn't always buy things back and if they do it isn't enough money to be worth it. The refurbished items tend to not work. Also the customer service is spotty.</text>

<Review>Went there twice. First time to fill up and repair my acrylicsl nail. Was really happy with it.
The second time, I took an appointment the day before, but still had to wait 35min for someone to show up and take care of me and my friend.
Pedicure is feeling really nice.
However, the regular manucure... I paid an extra $5 for a French and the day after most of it is gone just by washing my hands (gently...). I am really annoyed with that! But in general it's a good place.
Just make sure to have cash or venmo on your phone because they don't take card.</Review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I moved here last summer and was in search of a new nail place. I had several recommendations for tracy's and I am so happy I listened to everyone! I have had a different nail tech every time but every single experience has been great! There can be a bit of wait for walk ins but their business is worth it<//Review>

<text>lady was INCREDIBLY rude. charged me 20$ more then what it said on their website. i asked the lady how much my nails would cost and she was silent and wouldn’t tell me. nails were not even and poorly shaped. i showed them a picture of what i wanted my nails to look like and they didn’t use the colors i asked for. overall i felt taken advantage of and will not be coming again. do not recommend.<//text>< Rate>

Great waxing spot! I have yet to get my nails done but both times I went for a full leg and Brazilian were great experiences. Both times different women but timing and technique were awesome. Little pain in waxing and made me feel very comfortable. I always check when I get home and didn't find any stray hairs thankfully. Check in for a discount on waxing services. I've had friends recommend this place for nails and I am looking forward to getting them done here. Thanks Tracy Nails!<//text>

I came here for my wedding nails and they went above and beyond. I brought in a picture from Pinterest, and I wasn't sure if they were able to do it. The owner took my nails on and made it happen. They did SNS on my nails to strengthen them and make them longer. Then using gel nail polish she was able to get the color and the glitter I wanted. The nails lasted 3 weeks, and removal was a breeze.
They do a good job every time I have come here! And I'll be coming back for any nail needs.< /review>

This was an amazing place. My boyfriend and I went to get a pedicure. We got there about 8 minutes late but they were totally amazing. I got an pedicure and it was amazing. I love the environment! My brother who is a huge basketball fan was cheering with the staff and it was great to be around friendly people. Price was very reasonable. I made another appointment to take my daughter and I will defiantly be a frequent customer!!!<//text>

Tracy Nails is a clean, comfortable salon with excellent experienced staffs. I discovered it by mistake but truly a happy one! Super relaxing and tidy, this place is my go-to nail spot. Everyone here is friendly and accommodating to whatever you need for your nails. I absolutely recommend checking them out on a day you'd like to feel pampered and well taken care of!<//Review>

I went to Tracy Nails for the first time almost 3 weeks ago to get some acrylic tips for an event I had. They were able to make a same day appointment for me and a friend, and were immediately ready when we walked in. I had never gotten my nails done in Capitola, as I had heard nothing but bad stories no matter where my friends had gone. I decided to try Tracy Nails because none of my friends had been there before, so I had no bad stories in the back of my head.
The guy that did my nails was awesome at explaining what everything was, and was very understanding of the fact that I had a lot of questions (I'm a scientist, I like to understand what's going on around me!). He also really listened to what I wanted (I can't have too long of nails in the lab, but wanted them to look a certain way), and double-checked every step of the way that I was happy.
They came out looking great and I will definitely be going back soon to get them refilled.</Text>

This is definitely my favorite nail place. Had a wonderful experience. I've been to many, but keep returning to Tracy Nails. The technicians are very friendly and do a great job. Good customer service, a relaxed environment, relaxing and bright. They are very meticulously, gentle and patient. Very happy. I'll definitely come back!<//text>

My favorite nail salon I have ever been to in Capitola by far (I have tried a few over 4 years)! Can't believe I didn't come here sooner. Customer service is top notch and the staff is great. Nails look wonderful too! I'm definitely coming back for future appointments.</Review>

I was looking for a last minute nail salon and I was so happy to find Tracy Nails.
The place is clean and a staff - nice lady that did my nails absolutely did a good job in my mani and pedi. She was very meticulous in her work, took her time and I didnt feel rushed at all. I really loved how my nails turned out! I will definitely recommend!</Review>

<Review>I'm new to the area and found this place on Google... WOW! I am beyond impressed by how friendly everyone was and how SUPER clean and cute the salon is. It was very quiet when I went on a Wednesday evening, the somewhat hidden location might do the place a disservice from getting a lot of walk-in foot traffic. The friendly and funny young man who did my shellac mani and pedi was absolutely meticulous and attentive. And of course on top of all this, my nails look amazing! I will definitely be back.< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< Date>

<Text>This place is highly recommended. Love this place! Such a nice place. The place is clean and super modern. Super cute atmosphere and great customer service. The staff were amazingly nice and took great care of me. Everyone is very friendly as well and talented. They are very personable and tentative and always have a smile.  They have a ton of different color options. Plus, their prices are extremely reasonable for how high end the salon feels. Will come back!<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1596208007840, 'text': 'You are very nice. I appreciate your time leaving feedback for our store. See you soon.'}<//Resp>< rate>

I had a great first experience here this afternoon! I was happy with the cleanliness and outdoor chairs. I got a great basic gel manicure from Dolly, who was very attentive to detail. Didn’t feel rushed to get out. I also appreciated that the person answering the phone earlier in the day told me ahead that they are cash only.</Text>

I'm new to the area and found this place on Google... WOW! I am beyond impressed by how friendly everyone was and how SUPER clean and cute the salon is. It was very quiet when I went on a Wednesday evening, the somewhat hidden location might do the place a disservice from getting a lot of walk-in foot traffic. The friendly and funny young man who did my shellac mani and pedi was absolutely meticulous and attentive. And of course on top of all this, my nails look amazing! I will definitely be back.</review>

I've never found a salon where they care more about customers, take their time, guarantee their work, and  are so friendly!
It's been 1 years and I won't go anywhere else!
I love Tracy Nails!! Couldn't recommend them higher...< /review>

<review>I've been coming to the Tracy Nails for a couple of months now. I regularly get my nails done about twice a month. I love everyone that works here. Everyone is super friendly and really knows how to do nails!!l Everyone here is really talented. I also found that the pricing here is very reasonable compared to nail salons in the area. The nail salon is also very cleanly, relax and qiuet. I will keep coming.</review>< Pictures>

Amazing. Clean. Comfortable. Fun!
Came for during a bachorette weekend for my cousin. We made an appointment with another salon not knowing they couldn't accommodate the three of us at the same time. So we headed to another salon which was also booked up for the afternoon. One of the women there recommended Tracy Nails and it was the best recommendation ever! They were able to do all of our manis & pedis right away. Super comfy arm chairs during the pedis. Can't beat that! The women were all amazing - so much fun & entertaining. The price is completely worth the experience and it's one of the best salons I've ever been to.<//Review>

I've been coming here for 9 year and never truly never had an amazing experience. They rush their services, rarely do a full cleaning under the nail (finger or toes), and stress and push you for tips (and push for cash).. but this last time.. they ran after me saying I didn't pay.. i told them three times I venmoed Tracy before I left (they dont take cards cause Covid but cash is okay 🤦🏼‍♀️) and made me go back to the front desk to show me Tracys phone saying there is no payment when MY NAME was at the top of her venmo payments.. i didn't appreciate how I was treated especially after giving them generous tips they truly didn't deserve (see picture with edges not fully painted). They officially lost me as a client.</text>

< Review>
I am so impressed. I am somebody who is very picky about my Nails and Salons etc.. today was my first visit at Tracy Nails in Capitola. I was very nervous to try somebody new however the salons are not open yet where I live in Campbell. Tracy did my nails. She did the most amazing job and I am absolutely impressed I cannot speak  highly enough about it. I am allergic to powder liquid nails so Tracy molded my coffin shaped nails from Gel. The most beautiful set of nails I think I've ever had. My pedicure was impeccable and I even opted to have my lashes done. You won't find a better price or a better job on your lashes as well. Trust me when I say I am very picky and I cannot believe I left without one complaint and completely impressed. I can't even believe it. Bring your business here. This place is awesome. If you look on to the walls you will see that Tracy Nails has won awards every single year since they've been in business for being the best nail salon in Capitola. Thank you Tracy!❤< /Review>

Awesome!!! The atmosphere was quiet, clean and relaxing. I really loved my nail tech, didn't get her name but she really took her time with me. I highly recommend this shop, it's well worth the few extra bucks!<//review>

<review>Best nail salon ever. My girlfriend and I walked in a few minutes before they closed on and they were still happy to squeeze us in for pedicures. They offer a deluxe pedicure, and a hot stone massage.  The massage chairs for the pedicures were the best I've had, and the staff was very friendly! We will be happy to drive out of the way to come back here regularly.💗<//review>< gmapID>

< review>
@@@@@This was my first visit at the ""TRACY NAILS"" and bonus it was also my birthday! I came alone for some exclusive pampering that my husband wanted to treat me with.
I love the boutique feel and although it is a beautifully big place it is rather cozy. I also appreciated the personal tour and the opportunity to order my first ""beermosa"" which was particularly delightful. I ordered the service ""On the Rocks"" and added the yelp complimentary scrub. It felt amazing! My service provider was awesome with the service and small chitchat but I really do appreciate the sweet happy birthday song and candle with chocolate that was offered to me. I'm going again for sure.< /review>

If you are looking for a calm and relaxing place to get your nails done, Tracy Nails  is the spot!  They only do natural nails, so there isn't any noise from the hand drills or the nasty acrylic smell which I appreciate.  All the team members are friendly and welcoming.</text>

This place is easily one of the best places to get your nails done in this town. I get my hands done with mistress
which I think is the owner and my feet by girl. Everyone does an awesome job. My eyebrows always stay on point because of them as well. Only one girl does the eyebrows but I forgot her name. love love love this place. It's a must.&&&<//Text>

I took my 80-year-old grandma here for her first pedicure ever and she had THE BEST experience. The staff were super friendly, helpful, and accommodating - making her feel comfortable. She had so much fun! They are clean, professional, and very well run. Tracy is also an impressive philanthropist and funds families, orphanages, seniors, and people with disabilities in different communities in Vietnam, so supporting this salon definitely goes to a good cause. Highly recommend!</review>

<review>I can honestly say this is one of the best gel manicures I've ever had! I'm usually disappointed when I get my nails done and I am so excited to finally be happy with what I got. Very fairly priced too.  My favorite part was sitting in front of a window as I was getting my nails done and the view - made the experience even better. Thank you, I will be coming back!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

The quality you get really depends in who you get. These were done by Helen, very happy. Last set was done by Trang and those would have only gotten ⭐⭐/5. The main reason I keep going back is because they can almost always get you sat within 10 or so minutes.< /text>

We waited just 5 minutes without an appointment. The staff were very friendly comapared to what I've experienced before. The reason for 4 starts because of the smell of the chemicals and also the communication is hard. I asked for gold and got yellow.

These people gave me the BEST pedicure and shellac mani. I went here a few days before my wedding and got a pretty typical bridal set of nails (soft pink).

Let me just tell you- the shellac nails I got here lasted longer than the 50+ shellac manicures I've gotten over my lifetime. Seriously good stuff. My nails didn't chip AT ALL. EVER. Over time, the only way you could tell that my manicure wasn't new was because my nails grew out..so obviously just a natural occurrence.

The people at this salon were SOOO amazing and sweet. I brought a group of six women and they were able to accommodate all of us. We were in and out in 90 minutes and we all left very pleased with our services!!!

I recommend this location if you are ever needing to look for a trustful and 10 star results.< /Review>

Tracy's is amazing! I have had great experiences here and the services are priced well so you can get your mani pedi fix without emptying your bank account. They also offer waxing & eyelash services too!</Review>

Had a pedicure, she clipped my toe, never had this happen elsewhere.  Super busy crowded place, not relaxing at all, I'll stick to a smaller low key place.  Good prices here though for pedicure<//Review>

<Text>Recently started going to Tracy Nails.
I've been twice now so I figured I could make a review (in case the first time was a fluke ;)). But so far, my service has been wonderful, my nails are consistently done well (I get complimented on them often) and I love my nail tech!
They've got a returning customer in me!<//Text>< pics>

This has to be the largest salon I have ever seen, let alone been to. 10+ chairs for pedicures, and over 30 people doing nails. Not sure on the numbers of people, but it was clean and well run.< /Text>

<text>🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹I'm super picky about my gel manicures and  does a fantastic job about 95% of the time.  They get really close to the cuticle and sides of the nail bed. The really good people even put a layer of polish on the tip of your nails before doing a second coat of polish on the entire nail.  I never go anywhere else now for my manicures.🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹</text>< pics>

Every now and then I get a rush job or the nails are uneven. I had a super quick pedicure and felt like she rushed through it. I understand that it's a la carte but that's supposed to be a relaxing experience. They also don't let my feet soak long enough and I need to let them know that the water temp is always cold. I've been in the beauty business for many years and know what to expect. Again, for the most part they do a great job. Just don't be afraid to let them know what you want.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808e156b61efbd0f:0x122ef6695167fecf< /gmap_id></record>

i would not recommend. i said i wanted a full set and they gave me a manicure. after they realized their mistake they made me pay and extra $5 for the inconvenience that they brought on themselves. i was clear with my instructions start to finish. they were being quite rude after and they were all giving me dirty looks. at the end my cuticles looked horrible, my nails looked bumpy, they were horribly painted, and they made me bleed 3 times.  this is the worst nail experience i’ve ever had.< /Text>

*******My  resolution this year is to treat myself to pampering and girly treats.
I had such a good experience today. I got SNS nails today in a beautiful glittery grey-blue.  the technician that did my nails and she was very friendly and answered all my questions (I am new to fancy nails;). ) she made my formerly ratty nails look amazing and it made me feel more put-together and happy. Thank you for the good experience, attention to detail, great skills, and really nice customer service. ******(())< /Review>

<Review>Wow!

A few years ago, I would get my nails done often and they never compared to the service I received at "Tracy Nails". I'm definitely staying with this salon every time I do my nails from now on.

The employees here are so kind. She's sat with us while we were getting our nails done and she was so easy to get along with and talk to! She made the whole experience so easy going and we didn't hit that awkward silence stage where you don't know what to do with yourself but stare at the wall.

This is the place to go to if anyone wants an amazing experience. They took their time on your nails too and made sure they looked perfect.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808e156b61efbd0f:0x122ef6695167fecf</gmapID></record>

So relaxing.  They do a fantastic nob with the biggest selection of polishes.  I'm picky with my polish.  Go to Tracy's nails and get your feet soaked.  My feet look cuter than ever now.  I'm really impressed with the remodel!! Nice Big screen TVs to watch.  Friendly staff and fair prices.</Review>

Very relaxing. I got the basic mani pedi. Good rate.
I have tried several different salons closer to my house and they just do not compete. Super friendly staff that always help pick out the right color. They take their time to do a perfect job. I have been going to this salon for 2 years and it is the cleanest most consistently excellent salons in the city.  I always leave happy! Can't wait to go back!</Text>

Very very rushed. The fastest pedicure I’ve ever had. Was not relaxing at all. From the time I walked in the door to the time I was sitting to dry was 19 minutes. Definitely not a 20 min massage. And they left so much polish on my skin. Not satisfied at all.</Text>

<review>It is one of the better salons I have been too. One commonality of all the salons is that they rush you thru so the can service more customers and sometime they skip procedures or do a poor job.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I am obsessed. I've been coming here for over  and refuse to go anywhere else. This is the best nail spa. So. Clean. They open fresh styling tools. The place is always so clean and stylish. Fruit infused water. Warm tea, fruit, coffee--the receptionist always offers beverages. Wine & mimosas! the owner is the sweetest  and always makes sure you're happy. My nails stay looking great for 3 weeks with sns. Relaxing music. Great selection of colors from gel to sns - cool designs and chrome too. I've switched so many friends to this place because they are sooo great!💧💧💧💧💧< /Text>

In Capitola it's do hard to find mani and pedi for a good price along with a good staff. I'm all about hygiene and many places don't have that. I've never felt so blessed to do my hands and feet like this place. All the girl work excellent and take their time to detail. What I love most is the atmosphere I feel in the salon very welcoming. The color to choose from are almost infinite. I will definitely be coming back weekly to get my hands and feet done.< /Review>

I do not recommend this place, in only of  for 3 days after getting my acrylics nails set put , it broke! I didn’t even do anything that could cause it to fall off, also rushed way to fast, and when doing the file it my sling around my finger nail started to burn!< /Review>

I would not reccommend this place. Three of my nails broke in the span of a week, and it’s not like I do a lot of work with my hands. They also weren’t too friendly and they rushed my service. Their prices are cheap though so you get what you pay for.</review>

I have had both pedicures and manicures, and for each you see them open new utensils before starting. The default scent of the sugar scrub for the pedicure is lemongrass, which smells divine. The manicure came with an extensive arm and neck massage (which I appreciate but I was not aware was coming, so heads up if you're sensitive to touch outside a traditional massage).

Ask for a stamp card if they don't give you one, because you'll want to come back.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808e156b61efbd0f:0x122ef6695167fecf</gmap_id></record>

I had a French tip manicure and my daughter had her toes and fingernails painted (just the basic). At first I was so impressed with all the time they spent massaging our legs and such.  Well, without my asking, apparently they charged me extra for services I didn't ask for and in the end, the bill was like 25 dollars more than I expected.  Because I did not know what the norm was-we've gone once before many years ago-they totally took advantage of us. I had even been inquiring about the prices before we got started bc its hard for me to afford such luxuries.  The massaging chairs are great, but if you find yourself getting a long massage and a leg scrub you did not ask for, know that they WILL charge you extra.  So annoying!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

My nails look awful. The salon seemed confused on how to use dipping powder. My nails are thick and uneven not to mention not even close to the color of the sample. I wish I could post a picture. Horrible!

Edited to add...the owner corrected my nails.

Horrible service waited more than an hour an 2 People came in and went before me. Don’t recommend AT ALL. Tracy’s nails doesn’t even do good nails they are just cheap have bumps in the nails and leave dust in the nail polish.<//Review>

Edited to add...the owner corrected my nails.

I had a bad experience here. I called ahead for an appointment for dip nails. Right away I could tell the tech did not no what she was doing. She would not listen to me either. When removing my old set she over drilled an hurt my real nail beds several times. She cut my fingers with the drill in 3 places. When she was finally putting on the final top coat I kept telling her to put on clear gel. Of course the normal top coat did not dry. At least 5 techs came to look at my hands. It was awkward enough that the customer next to me asked if I had gotten something special.

Finally a different tech removed the top coat and put on gel. The whole process was 2 hours!!!!!!! Plus my nail beds are so sore this morning it’s like I got a new set.

I will never go here again.< /text>

Worst set I’ve ever had. When they were done, it looked like I already needed a fill. A week later my nails are falling apart and oh they didn’t even paint the sides of my nail.<//Review>

I found her in Facebook and I saw all these pictures of the extensions she made I thought I'd try myself she charged me $400 for the hair extensions only one week after the hair looks really bad 4 weeks later I go to her and show her how my hair looks like she said I'll take it off for you so basically I paid $400 to use fake hair for 4 weeks she didn't offer me anything else and by the way she does a horrible job on lashes.< /review>

There is a MASK MANDATE in place so this is very dangerous and wreckless. You lost a customer by not following CDC or Covid guidelines and now I have to drive somewhere else to get my car cleaned. Thanks so much. Please don’t support this place as they need to be reported for putting their customers at risk. Horrible service too no one even came to ask if I needed help and the person who picked up the phone was super rude.<//text>< name>

Online it says they close at 8pm on Thursday so I called to verify since most places have alternate schedule due to covid and a man said they close at 7pm. Showed up right before 6pm and they turned us away saying they were closed. I called to ask why they tell me 7pm if they were only going to turn us away. The man who seemed to be the owner stated sometimes they (the employees) do close without telling him. That was completely inconvenient,  annoying and unprofessional.</text></record></dataset><record>

I brought my car to USA Detail and Car Wash after neglecting to clean my engine bay for six months. I had ridden it through the desert in playa dust, which is known to corrode and destroy engine components that get exposed.

I finally got around to it, and Jesus at USA Detail was there to help me out. I thought it would hardly be possible to clean because of how coked on the dust had become over half a year, but the job they did was simply outstanding.

I also got a simple car wash (in and out) and since the job took a little longer than expected, Jesus threw on a wash of my carpets and even fixed a huge scratch on the side of the car, free of charge.

Will definitely be coming back and highly recommend this place to anyone considering it, the team does a fantastic job.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>My car looks brand new.. on the exterior..so that’s great. But on the inside, they definitely didn’t do everything they were supposed to do. And I know it’s because I had a Groupon. I walked up and asked for a detail and said I had a Groupon. And he immediately asked to see how much I paid for it. Not the level of the detail I purchased, bu how much I paid on Groupon, even after discounts. So this was the basis of the level of detail they were planning to do. They didn’t vacuum my carpets. And if they did, they never completed the job. They didn’t clean the middle console. I didn’t really need seats shampoo’d but you can tell they didn’t even think about it even though it was included. All of that is to say that please don’t get mad at customers for purchasing Groupons, be upset with your boss for marketing on there. But truthfully you should be happy because it brings you business. And even after all of that I gave a reasonable tip based on the original price because they took their time with my car and deserved it. Just please be better, because you can have loyal customers through great experiences.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2c60dd7106221:0xfe0bafeff3bc8cb2<//gmap_id><username>Elizabeth E.<//username><resp>None< /resp><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

These guys are great! Always worth the money and even willing to negotiate. I bought my car used and it had a few stains on the interior, brought it here and it left spotless. Not sure what magic they used but it worked! There's never a wait when I go before work! The staff is nice too. So lucky this place is around the corner from me.< /Review>

I've been here twice and they take good care of your vehicle. If you're invested in the appearance and cleanliness of your car then I highly recommend it. I'm like half way, I care about how my car looks a little so I come here as a treat every other month or so. I'm always happy with their work here when I do come though.< /review>

They did a great job! My car was filthy and now super clean it only took 30 minutes and it was $35. I have a full size sedan. I would definitely recommend getting your car washed here. Everyone who work there was also very helpful and polite.< /text>

I spoke with Jesús, the manager, who took the time to help me put together the right detailing package for what I needed and match my budget. Not only was their customer service on point, Jesús made sure it was on time, as promised, and I'm delighted with the results!

Jeff has been super helpful, accommodating an appointment for car wash and clean, on a short notice on Sunday. My car was broken into that morning and I was looking to get rid of all the glass and dirt to get my car back to normal. Daniel did a wonderful job getting the car washed and clean.

Very good services. Kids had the seats extremely dirty and they left them looking brand new. 4 seat camaro for 100$ bucks(25$ per seat), plus they threw in the car wash for free and even waxed it😁 Very pleased.👍 Really helpful guys, was even offered a ride home if I didn't want to wait during the process.<//Text>

So I paid via Groupon for a Complete Interior and Super Exterior Detailed Wash.... Well it took almost 3 hours and it was poorly done I even gave a tip but regret that because the complete interior is still soaked even 3 hours later. I will never come here to get anything done they did a poor job with even the car wash my windows are streaked and stained. I'm not happy at all they didn't even want to give the paper floor mat without me asking for it. Too expensive even with the discount for the job not to be done right.</Review>

After negotiation got them down to $200 (before tip). It was a rental car and there was no reason to sell us expensive detailing. Felt like they were dishonest in their price quote. They did, however, cleaned the car well.<//review>< time>

It is the best place for having your car washed. Since the place of my preference was closed I had been looking for a car wash that do a good job and this is the one. Everything is done by hand, no machines during the washing, so it takes time. There is a resting area with a very comfortable chairs. If time is your worry feel free to go somewhere else to have your car just soaked! Here you won't be disappointed.</text>

I’ve been going here for two years now. They always do a great job on my car , they close pretty late  which works perfect with my schedule. Ask for Magen he's always pleasant to talk to and never lets you down.<//text>

Terrible customer service , overpriced for the poor quality car washes they do and they will try to overcharge you . My car needed a basic wash and the man who i spoke  swore up and down that he need to pressure wash my car  so he wanted 35 dollars for a basic wash. Went home sprayed the car with just water and the dirt just slid off. Will never come back , after 10 yrs of being a customer. They got greedy and the quality isn't as good.<//Text>

Such incredible work from the guys here at USA Detail & Car Wash. Jesus and the team here got my car looking BRAND NEW inside and out very quickly and for the best price. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a fantastic car wash!</Review>

Been going here since it was teos car so been years today i find this place is now usa company and i was used to paying 15$ for a wash now the price is 25$ although they do the same job cause most of the guys r from way back i dont believe its worth the 25$ for a wash...vacuum armor all on tires over priced and definitely unfortunately this will b the last time ill come here.</Review>

<Name>Alex Kuznetsov<//Name><review>This place is top quality with friendly employees and owner. They have a big selection of Russian candies and chocolates.  They also have a huge selection of cooked and prepared Russian products that include things like fish, meat, chicken, mushrooms, crab, etc. You won't find any of these elsewhere in the valley. They are fresh and most of the time made the same day. If you want something made ahead of time then you can order it in advance.

Other things to look for here are Russian dumplings. While they are bit more pricey than other places they are still of great quality.<//review></record>

The selection is huge with varieties of meats, cheeses, fish, etc. The staff is super friendly and helpful, and everything I've tried has been priced reasonably. They have a convenient parking lot on the side too!

My personal favorite are the crepes (blintzes as they call them) which are honestly out of this world.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) Excellent shop! Always fresh food. And cooking - you’ll just lick your fingers! The presence of a pharmacy with Russian medicines is especially pleasing!

"Русский" магазинчик. Средний выбор продуктов для "ностальгирующих". Стоянку найти рядом трудновато. В туалет не пускают, что очень снизило мою оценку этого места...<//Review>< Time>

<gmapID>0x809a50976ded7fc7:0xd58b43782b1a3c7e< /gmapID><review>I've been going to this particular Denny's since 2010, ever since I was raised in the county. And WOW this is the Worst service I have ever had. I am SO disappointed at the lack of common sense and this is the last strike for me. The food just isn't that great and never gets cooked right. We usually order easy meals but still. Watered down sauces here beware. Super salty chicken, barely cooked please dont eat their beef or chicken here it has expired packing dates they swap. And the worst part was the pickup order on the new app. Whoever thought it was a good idea to put heavy food items on top instead of the lightweight chips thanks. Hire non-retards.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Good food & nice time with the family.  My server seemed really tired though.  They work some tough hours!

Went again yesterday for lunch & my server was not very friendly.  Even took my soup without asking if I was done. I wasn't. Didn't ask many questions I did the asking but my food was great just not the service.  Maybe he was stressed due to it being busy.  Sad good food & stressed servers.< /Text>

Food was great, otherwise this would’ve been a 1 star review... server/cashier not friendly in any way, horrible representative of your company. You need to hire and now, employees like this will cost you business</Text>

As always, the consistency of good food at reasonable rates. Minor glitch...menu changed. I am certain this is due to Covid regulations. No waffles, which is why we chose Denny's in the first place.  ☹ Service was great and we will return.  It has been months and we missed our Denny's.  Glad they are open for dining IN.  Please bring back the Waffles. 😎💖</Review>

So Denny's is one my favorite places to common eat breakfast their burgers are fire . I always appreciate the service I have except my experience she did forget my toast but I'm not gonna mark any points because I love Denny's that much I've never been done wrong the employees are always nice every time I go to any Denny's. But every time I walk into a Denny's or any restaurant I always ask can I do Google reveal and I always tell mom basing my opinion off my experience</Review>

Food was good...service was okay but with the times as they are, I was glad to sit and be served. Gotta say though...when tgey were serving outside it was kind of a nice change.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Worse service ever , we waited at least ,45-50 min still no food . I asked how much more time before we received our food to 2 different waitresses THEY BOTH said "let me check and never came back to say sorry were having problems in the kitchen, or its going  to be an extra 10 min . Absolutely nothing Breakfast was ruined at that point so decided to leave horrible horrible service. I can see if the place was packed with people but it wasn't so no excuse I think the waitress simply forgot to put our order in more then once or somethings just wrong with the flow at this Denny's . Went next door to Carl's Jr's not even 5min and were eating .So disappointing.</Text><Date>1575143780691</Date>< Response>

<rating>4</rating><Review>It was a perfect time to come because this particular day the restaurant was not busy. The food came out quickly and perfectly hot and tasty. Everything was clean including the rest room and parking lot. The server was all business which is to say she wasn't unfriendly but didn't really try to be attentive nor social and my tip reflected as much. Because I came in wearing a back pack she may have assumed I am homeless, big mistake on her part.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Denny's has always been a good stand by place to eat, when traveling, or at home and you just don't feel like cooking. You always know what to expect and you never disappointed. Never much surprised either, that is until last week. I had an incident with my heart which wound me up in the ICU at Marshall for 10 days. When I got out the family wanted to go to Denny's so I reluctantly tagged along. What I found out was they have a few heart healthy diets and the one I picked was exceptionally good. The price was right, the atmosphere was Denny's so all around I had a great experience. Thanks Dennys!</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< userid>

This place was bad there is one server who was nice but the wait to sit was long. Not only that but the wait for food was literally 1 hour and 30 minutes the milk was going bad which you can clearly smell. The bathrooms were terrible dirty and grime stuck everywhere. The food was not bad but you can tell it was sitting for a good while before it was brought out I feel bad for people going here. To top it all off people which were sat after us got their food first. I feel bad for the one waitress which was nice due to the fact she had to try and calm customer's down from anger and work on holidays.<//Text>

<Text>I usually visit this Dennys late at night after midnight. This is when I don't feel up to cooking and want something simple. During the week it's pretty quiet during these times and the wait is very short. There's a female waitress whom I can't remember the name, but she is very friendly and demonstrates a hard work ethic.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>This was my first time in this theater. To say the least I was surprised when I walked in and found I had a bar Liquor counter in front of me and it was also a restaurant. And then you can sit in your seat in order food. This baby fine for some people but it didn't turn me on. So wouldn't be my favorite theater if I lived in this area.<//text><userid>104591106443797788507<//userid><Response>None<//Response>< pictures>

<Text>Really wish I could review this higher considering I grew up going to this Denny's and loved it growing up but it seems like they are going a little downhill. Staff was nice and attentive but we were not very impressed with the food. Talking to others, they've been very consistent in serving almost rock hard biscuits which I'm pretty sure isn't a staple of theirs. Everything else was fine and we were sat down very quickly.<//Text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Terrible Experience.  Was treated like dirt.  My wife was told she was wrong.  Tried to complain to manager and waitress came talking smack about the situation.  Wife got upset and left.  Manager followed her to lot and said meals would be comped.  Then manager came in and charged us for the meals besides hers.  Terrible experience.  DO NOT Recommend at all.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Went to have breakfast today and I was talked Into a better deal then what I ordered, because it came with more food and a free o.j. or coffee. But when I went to pay my bill it just said I owed $32.47
Sadly I realized later much later, How did it come to that.. When I looked at the slip it did not show anything I ordered. Not one item, just the total. I was shocked. WHAT DID THEY CHARGE ME FOR.
Not going ever again. Where are the prices for the meal I ordered???< /Review>

It's a Dennys. Its reasonably priced filling food. Middle of the road quality. Servers were friendly and the food was served reasonably quickly. Honestly it's sit down fast food. Not great, not bad.</review>

After 5 min of ordering drinks I had to ask the waiter for my coffee. There was only one other couple. Then after waiting 40 min I asked where our food was. He said it's coming shortly. Waiting almost 10 more min for our food. Then there was about 4or 5 other tables. Finally got our food and the pancakes weren't done all the way and neither was the bacon. I picked off the cooked parts. I asked for a diet coke and was given a coke.
Yes we should of left. We already waited this long and we were traveling. After eating and on the road I was so nauseated. Definitely will not be stopping the anymore.<//text>

<review>Good food. Good staff. Thanks to the bald gentleman, with the skull tattoo on his left fist, who was wearing the leather bracelt and paracord on his right hand. Very skillful customer service.

Dull customers! I specifically go out to restaurants at 1 am to easedrop on interesting conversations from shady folks! The only people who come are boring people with no criminal records! Go somewhere else for weirdos! You won’t find them here.< /review><username>Walter White<//username>< Response>

<Text>The experience is horrible.  The food was nasty. Everytime we have gone we have had to wait forever for our food. The food we did order was cold and tasted like it was under a warmer. The hot cocoa wasn't even hot maybe luke warm. The waitress would make excuses like oh we are under staff or something like that. When we actually wrote to Denny's and complained we did not get ANY response back. Would not recommend.  Go somewhere else besides here. I wish you could give no stars because they deserve negative stars. I give this negative 5 stars.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Pretty good diner as far as Denny's go. Our server had some good-spirited sass to her, which was an amusing change. Biscuits and gravy were as good as Dennys can do and eggs were sunny side up as I like them. Free refills on coffee were timely and just the thing for powering through the rest of the day.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Get with the times and allow online ordering, for the love of all breakfast foods, please.

I've been waiting for several months now, ever since they even advertised on tv that Denny's had online ordering. You type in Placerville's Denny's on google, and there's a specific link that leads you to order online.

You can add everything you want to the cart. Only when you get to nearly the end of the transaction at hand, does it tell you, Oh! Well that's not gonna work. Just call.

It's annoying. Please set it up soon.</text>< username>

< review>
Possibly the worst dining experience of my life. We heard every excuse in the book, from being understaffed, to "it's not my fault" but there is NEVER a reason to wait 1.5 hours for food!!! They knew before we sat down that they were understaffed because a waitress that should be fired called in an hour before her shift and a cook called in a day before their shift and yet they still neglected to inform the people they were seating that it would be a minimum of an hour before receiving any food (if the server actually got it correct). All the people who arrived at 10 a.m. did not receive their food until after 12 p.m. and the only people that received a discount were the ones who screamed about the wait. By the way, the manager was in the kitchen "cooking" badly and everyone who receive their food complained about it being cold. We (a party of 3/value menu) also received cold food and when we complained about it, received food with a pound of hot gravy or hot butter on top of cold food. We did not receive a discount and were not able to eat our food or talk to the manager because "he was busy" after an hour-and-a-half waiting. I honestly hope everyone at this location is fired and the restaurant is closed down. By the way, there way, 2 men ( obviously regulars) that came in 30 minutes after 4 of the groups in the same section arrived, and had been waiting an hour, were sat, fed, and on their way before the other 4 groups. When one of the other groups asked why they were offered a discount and shut up. Worst, by far, worst experience of the 30 or so people that I've ever heard fight for eggs to date! Shut this place down or inform your customers of your incompetence when they walk it!!! I will be contacting the corporate office in hopes to make a change.<//review>

Who doesn't like a good ol' Denny's Restaraunt?
Been going to them for year's...at least since I came to this area back in 1991. It seems like this one that's left off of Placerville Drive is one of the only one's left in Eldorado County. Their always friendly, open 24 hours, and have good appetizers you can share if you don't want an accrual meal or while your waiting for your meal. Either way, it's always a good atmosphere and kind workers</review>

<date>1527128441627</date><text>Absolutely atrocious.
I've ordered food several times from this location and it seems as though in the few months since I've been there quality has gone down considerably.
Ordered a to go burger and not only did it explode in the, much cheaper now, container from restaurant to car the bourbon sauce is now a very liquid overly sugared teriyaki sauce.
Really disappointed in the quality cuts.< /text>< gmap_id>

Absolutely awful service. Waited for an hour, after 15 mins of being there, our order was taken and when we asked 45 mins later when our food would be ready, they didn't  know. There was only 2 families there when we got there, after an hour, 6 other families arrived and also waited.  We ended up paying 10 dollars in drinks and left. Our waitress name was Helena and was so unprofessional.</text>

I don't know if it's just a sign of the times, but I've been coming to this Denny's since I was a shorty with Gramps. Anyhow. The service was pathetic, the waitress was rude and though there was nobody in the place it took FOREVER to get my meal.< /Text>

Sat over 5min, I ask the manager for a different section as our server kept neglecting us, and the manager shook his head 'no'. As I pushed for my request, he said 'I'll send someone over.'
I came over because the person they sent keeps neglecting our table, never even got drinks, no greet, nothing.
We walked out.
I've worked these kind of jobs for years. That's ridiculous and unprofessional. Never again.< /Review>

Experienced rude service by a small guy, in his thirties, who shaves his head. He seemed to go out of his way to be rude to our table not sure why? I'm a quiet person so I didn't say much. I'm a good tipper but this time I didn't feel like tipping. In addition, this is the first review I've ever written, that's how bad the service was by this one waiter that I felt so inclined to say something about it. I've had other waiters at this same restaurant and they were all pretty nice, but this one guy made me not want to go back.<//text>

Food is always good. There's a different Denny's closer to my house but I commute an extra 10 mins to this location bc the food and service is much better.< /review>

First of all I have to say I am VERY impressed with the manager, Tom. I called in a To-Go order on a busy Sun. morning, when I called back later to say "Thank you" Tom recognized my voice & even remembered my name! He was very upbeat & made it a JOY to order from him :) (Also kudos to him because I assume he was manning the front because they were down a staff member, & doing a great job!). I ordered my eggs over-medium & bacon crispy, I was worried my egg whites might still be slimy & I'd have to re-cook the bacon also. But not at all! The eggs were soo perfect, exactly what I wanted & the bacon too! Oh & the oatmeal is perfect (I like it more runny than thick). I'm pregnant & was really craving this, so I could not be more happy right now :)) Previously I chose to stay the heck away from Denny's (for about 8 yrs!) due to several negative experiences years ago at a diff. location, I won't say exactly what the last straw was because it's gross, but basically there was something in my food that shouldn't have been there :( So you can imagine my apprehensiveness about eating at any Denny's. Since visiting this location 3-4 times my trust in Denny's (at least this location) is fully restored! Every time we go the servers are upbeat & polite making it an enjoyable dining experience, & I've been pretty impressed with the food being cooked to order as well. Lastly it's a nice atmosphere, I don't know if they re-did it or maybe there was a steakhouse there previously & they kept the design/ deco., but it's a very nice setting as well. This location has turned me into a Happy HaPpY customer, very nice establishment :))) Thank you Tom & staff at Placerville Denny's!!!</text>

First time was bad the second time was okay it takes a long time for them to get to you and even though they didn't have a lot of people they still took a little bit too long right away they asked us what we'd like to drink we said we'd order the drinks when we order our food she said okay then about an hour past and she finally asked us what we'd like to eat weed told her the stuff and then it took about an hour and a half to get our food there's only about 18 people they're not a lot and then we got our food<//text>

If I could put 0, I totally would!!!!! We as a group like Dennys a lot especially when we travel, but this location by far the worst customer service ever! Not only did we come to an empty Dennys and were waiting for 40+ minutes to get our food, one of the party members didn't get his good at all! The waiter ended up asking what is it that you ordered?! Totally unacceptable and plain rude. Will never go back to this location again!!!<//Review>

< Review>
I wish I could talk to the owner! I get it’s a Small homophonic place, but come on. Took 30 minuets to get out food. The waitress never even checked on us. Was rude when she did talk to us. Coffee tasted really bad. She didn’t ask if we wanted creamer like she did for the other tables. We went to pay and the (I think was the manager) had to print out our receipt. Kept tapping it for us to pay. Wouldn’t listen to what we had to say. And when he finally did he talked back to us. I didn’t drink the coffee, and he processed to say “I’ve been drinking it all day, we woke 33 gallons of it”. I don’t care it was a bad cup, don’t talk back to your costumers. I grow up here, this was my favorite place to eat but now after that rudeness never again. We chose to eat at your establishment. And you chose to be rude. My food was good, but you can tell it sat in the window. You could tell that the woman didn’t want to serve us. And the guy at the register was even worse. You never talk back to your costumers!  I will be making a complaint over management.< /Review>

The food is okay, the wait staff can be extremely slow and it can be too cold inside (while you eat you shouldn't be shaking).< /review>

We had to wait more than 45 min for our food to arrive although there were not many people in the restaurant there was only one cosinero. I think they should be a little more careful to have enough staff to serve customers on a Saturday night.

Llegamos a este lugar después de un viaje en carro de 4 hrs. Tuvimos que esperar más de 45 min para que llegara nuestra comida aunque no había mucha gente en el restaurante solo había un cosinero. Creo que deberían de ser un poco más cuidadosos respeto a tener personal suficiente por atender  la clientela un sábado por la noche.</text>< Pics>
