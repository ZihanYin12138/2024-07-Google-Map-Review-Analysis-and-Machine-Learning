<Text>I actually like this little park for many years it was very ran down by drug addicts and the new management has turned that around, older tenants can't get away with what they used to so they are mad at management but the girl in the office doesn't set her hours nor the raise increases maybe everyone is directing their anger to the wrong people!  They are actually very nice people and very helpful if you act right and with all these horrible comments who wouldn't put a lock on their gate, I would too!  Move out if you don't like it!  you won't because you won't find a better deal!< /Text>< rate>

No security in park. Management says they can't do anything. One trailer is bringing all walks of life in our park known drug spot and nothing is done about it. We love this park. Nice people live here. Management knows the problem n turns the other cheek.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

This place is ridiculous I might add. Increase in rent to pay a maintenance to fix up their place? Full of people living in other people's storage sheds. Electricity is not calculated correctly.  Place just needs better everything. Not worth it. Makes sense why more and more people are moving etc. Discrimination at its highest here. No one's rent here is the same raises are all different due to what they feel suit. Star management company isn't great either. Rarely in office. No calls back . It goes on .< /Text>

Haven't lived here but about a year. Two increases in the rent for no respect from management at all. Place is horribly kept. However, looking at managements home looks very updated. New fence,and everything. Noticed that there's a  lock on fence towards front door.  Why is there a lock? What if your tenant is having a emergency of some sort? This place isn't worth it. I've seen more than 10 families move out.... should tell you something. Poor poor management. Place would be great if managed correctly.< /text>

Seeing isn't believing here my friend's. Place is a Rip off!!! Notice corporate comes to visit they get on there stuff. Moment they leave it's back to normal. Rules don't apply to them ever. Goes out the wrong way, down a one way but has audacity to get on other's for doing it. Place is a joke.< /review>

Hasn't anyone noticed how everything has risen since new horrible management came. Everything has changed and not for the better either. She has no respect from anyone here due to her only picking and choosing who to pick on. She does choose favorites. No one here is treated the same. And she never has to follow the "rules" so y should anyone else? She does delete comments unsure of why ? Actually, I know why because people are actually calling her on her mess. New hours with little time. No weekend days in office. Meanwhile her office is connected to house not understanding big deal on how she can decrease time frames. But here washer and dryer have went up in price. Rent 2x there's absolutely no parking for guests due to only 3 visitors parking for the entire lot. Smh.she only seems to pick on people on the 1st row where her cameras are significantly pointing at certain tenants spaces. Descrimination at it's finest. Yes there's a lock on her gate so there's no way to walk to her door in case an emergency. Just all in all they new completely new management.<//text>

<Review>There's been better management before this lady.she Definitely down graded park. Maintenance sucks.she Discriminates against Tennant's a lot. Only picks and chooses who she says things to. Really unhappy. they need better management here. New management. she barely is ever even working. I've been there 4x each of which are during her minimal hours of operation now. Mon-fri am9-1pm. Not even open Saturday anymore. So lazy. Maintenance isn't any better I see the elderly man work harder and more than Andy the actual main maintenance man.smh< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

DON'T DO IT. SIESTA SUCKS. POOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. RAISES RENT 2XS IN ONE YEAR TO PAY MAINTENANCE MAN TO WORK ON HIS PLACE AND NOT PARK. OLDER MAN WORKS HARDER THAN HIM. THEY RAISE WASH AND DRY? AND SEEMS LIKE UTILITIES KEEP SKY ROCKETING AS OTHERS HAVE SAID. BEEN CALLING MANAGEMENT COMPANY NO RESPONSE?! USER'S ARE WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE EVEN FOR PPL WHO'VE LIVED HERE OVER 5+ YRS.  SHE COMES AND MESSES EVERYONE'S STUFF UP. NO VISITORS PARKING AT ALL. RAISES RENT AND UTILITIES.... AND WASH+DRY 2XS . MEANWHILE WE HAVEN'T HAD A FRONT DRYER IN OVER 2 MONTHS NOW..... WHAT IS THE MANAGER OR MANAGEMENT COMPANY FOR IF THIS PLACE LOOKS THE WAY IT DOES. CLEAN UP THE ELECTRICAL CORDS IN MIDDLE OF TRAILERS HANGING, EXPOSED... ETC..  FENCE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED... FIX THIS PLACE..... AND WE'RE PAYING FOR HER TO LIVE HERE. FOLLOWS HER OWN RULES SO MANY PPL HAVE MOVED..  IT'S CRAZY. EXITS PARK GOING WRONG WAY. U CAN DELETE MY COMMENT. I'VE SCREEN SHOTTED THEM ALL.

<Date>1509472382472< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>Noticed deletion of comments. Place isn't kept up at all. Management sucks. Rent has been raised 2xs within this year. For poor management. Also she doesn't really ever be in her office limited hours which have decreased even to no weekends which how can people who work mon-fri 8-6 speak with her? If she's only in the office when people are at work. Not to mention she's lazy and so is her boyfriend the so called "maitnence" letting the older man do all the hard work. There's also a lock on her front gate which is to her front door. So if there's an emergency how is one to contact you if no one ever answers phone, in their office or lazy and do jobs poorly. This place needs no raise in rent especially if the fixes they make are half ass anyway.</review>< pictures>

She works and improves get place. What about the outside gate around park?  What about wash runs and the broken washers and dryers.  The side pathways. There's so much work here. The supposed " playground. " Improve parking. I seen a comment about her lock. Lol funny thing she removed it.  I seen it too thought very odd for a "manager." She poorly keeps this place. We do better in our own here. Rules apply to whom she choses.  One way. Not worth the two rent increases not any lol. Addicts live in ppl sheds lol.  All kinds of crazy stuff.<//Text>

<review>Service was 5-stars—very attentive.
Food was 3 to 4 stars.
Had the Premium Omakase—all the darker fish (salmon, toro, uni, yellowtail, etc.) were delicious, flavorful, and well textured, but all the whitefish (snapper, kanpachi, albacore) were chewy.  Maybe some of the fish was just off that night?
I did like the rice; had a finer taste than many other sushi restaurants.
My friends that I dined with all felt similar about the sushi although we differed on the rice and almost wondered if it was brown rice.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>One of my favorite sushi places in all of LA county! The sushi is traditional and fresh. It's pricey but I highly recommend the Omakase set because it is amazing.</text>< Pictures>

<review>This was our second time. I am so glad it tastes just as good as the first which was 2 yrs ago. We ordered the premium omakase (chef's picks) for $60 per person. It comes with 18 things. Appetizer, 14 nigiris, 1 handroll, choice between miso soup or fried shrimp head, ice cream (whatever the flavor is that day: it was green tea this time and last time it was black sesame). Right now they only serve outside and to-go. There are three tables outside so you need to reserve ahead of time. I wish I lived nearby so I could go all the time! Love love love this place!</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Incredible sushi for the price!!

We got the premium omakase which included an appetizer, a bunch of nigiri, and dessert.

The appetizer was flavorful but a bit heavy for me. The fiancé finished my plate so he clearly loved it.

I love places like this one where the sushi chef handles the sauces and wasabi, and I don't need to dip anything in soy sauce. They asked if we wanted our shrimp head fried or cooked in miso soup which was kinda fun.

The sesame ice cream was delicious too - I wanted just a taste and ended up eating the whole thing :)<//Review>

We were looking for an affordable but quality LA omakase experience and Sushi Chitose far exceeded those expectations. It's a fairly small space hidden away in a quiet residential neighborhood. There are basic and deluxe options for omakase priced at $45 and $60. We opted for deluxe as it was still a bargain relative to the standard LA fare.

The quantity was impressive, in total there were probably around 14-15 rounds with a couple consisting of multiple pieces. As someone with a large appetite, I was definitely satisfied by the end. The style was by and large pretty traditional without any crazy experimental curveballs. However, the level of technical execution was evident in the fresh, pure, and focused taste of each piece. A couple pleasant surprises included a monkfish foie gras starter and maybe the best uni/ikura pairing I've ever had (hard to beat that proximal Pacific freshness).

The service was also very good throughout the meal. All in all this was an incredible bargain, maybe among the best in the city. I'd highly recommend Sushi Chitose to any level of sushi lover.<//Text>

<text>Easily the best omakase in the entire South Bay. My friend brought me here the other day and after trying almost every fantastic sushi spot in the area Sushi Chitose tops the list. Reasonable prices, friendly staff and of course amazing sushi makes this my new go to spot. The premium Omakase blew my mind just as much as the standard Omakase, both are a excellent choice.The non-sushi items like there Shishito Peppers and craft beer from Japan were to die for as well. I drive by Sushi Chitose weekly and never noticed it. The outside is extremely low-key but when you step inside the small, quaint Sushi bar it is warm and inviting. I feel like Im going to be talking about Sushi Chitose for awhile as I can not stop recommending this spot to my friends and family. Do yourself a favor and check out this hidden gem.< /text>< Time>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I almost didn't go in and that would have been a huge mistake.  To say this place is unassuming may be an understatement! ...but this ended up being in the top 2 sushi experiences I have had (next to Japango in Toronto).  The omakase was fantastic and I challenge anyone to find a better fish selection for the money!  Super fresh cuts that melted in my mouth...so I kept going when the omakase was done.  My experience started with monk fish liver.  I learned that I actually do like this after having it here.  Then, from the pictures:
1. Hamachi (premium yellow tail)
2. King Salmon
3. Madai (red snapper with mint and ginger...amazing!)
4. Blue Fin Tuna in soy
5. Yellow Tail (great,  but not quite as good as #1)
6. Maguro (tuna)
7. Not sure
8. Shenaji (premium mackerel)
9. Albacore Tuna
10. Ebi (Shrimp)
11. Hotate (Scallop)
12. Uni (Sea Urchin)
13. Ikura (Salmon Roe)
14. Toro hand roll
15. Unagi (Freshwater Eel)
16. Tamago (Omlet)

As I said,  I couldn't stop the so the chef kept going,  which ended with some even higher premium cuts!
1. Aka Amadai (Tilefish)
2. Isaki (Chicken Grunt Fish)
3. Kinme Dai (Alfonsino/Golden Eye Snapper)
4. Seared Kama Toro
5. Nadoguro (Blackthroat Seaperch)
6. Then I ordered the spicy hotate roll for dessert...

I really enjoyed my time here and would highly recommend it!</Text>< pictures>

Traditional sushi restaurant, no Americanized rolls. Sushi is tender, seaweed has high umami, eggs have great egg flavor (a bit sugary, but that's the traditional recipe), belly cuts available and melts in your mouth, perfect bite sized nigiri. Some may say they are too small, but I'd prefer quality over quantity. Without talking to the chef, but the philosophy seems to be striving for perfection in the simple, traditional, understated but quality foods. Only one nit is that I'm super picky on the quality of uni and tonight the uni has that strong nasty/fishy taste which is a big disappointment.< /review>

This place has very tasty food at a good price!
I used to order from here about once a week but they would always get my order wrong. Their excuse was they were transitioning the menu.
However this time the food was prepared on time and it was very fresh.</Review>

<Time>1606199634152<//Time><Review>Disappointed summarized my review as I was quite excited to try this little restaurant but it fell far short of impressing me based on reviews and rankings this business has for sushi in LA. First, when you walk in  you are hit in the face with a distinct fish smell which already tells you the sushi is not being kept cooler than room temp which was also apparent when served due to taste and texture. The selection of sushi is appreciated but the quality is not up to par with reviews or ranking in the LA area for sushi. I saw this ranked in the top 10 in LA and am highly disappointed. People there is better places in LA!! For those of you looking, keep looking as there are better. As such, I will not be returning. Last, if you are questioning my sushi taste as I can hear you already saying that I don't know. I have and still do travel the US about 90% of the year eating at some of the best sushi restaurants across all of the states. I prefer sashimi or nigiri but above all else, I prefer raw fish, no cooked fish or seaweed wrapper masking the true flavor. I am a purest.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The best sushi I have ever had in the south bay. It's expensive, but the quality of the fish is top shelf and beyond. It is not your typical sushi experience. It is very Japanese tradition sushi. You will not find a California roll or dragon roll at this place. Its a small place, but the sushi eating experience will blow your mind. An absolute must try. Plan on spending some money, but get ready to experience sushi like it's supposed to be experienced.<//text></record></dataset><record>

This is traditional Japanese sushi. You will NOT find California roll on the menu and other sushi rolls or cuts that you are use to. This is the real deal for sushi. A bit pricy but the fish and the chef/owner is worth every penny. The best sushi restaurant in the South bay by far.< /text>

By far the best sushi I've ever had! I wouldn't call it cheap, but the price is good for the high quality of sushi.< /Text>

Being a lover of sushi I am a little embarrassed that I didn't know about this amazing place until now! Sushi Chitose is a small sushi restaurant in Redondo Beach that serves really fresh sushi at a really great price. We came for the Omakase, of course, and got the $60 premium omakase which is about 16 items. I almost could not believe the quality of the seafood we received at the price of $60! Sure, we didn't get some of the more fancy ingredients like in the $200 sushi spots, the food was really good and unpretentious. Some of my favorites that were served that night were:

Monkfish liver (appetizer): flavor was so intense but made refreshing with the bed of seaweed.

Sweet shrimp: ok, not hard to like sweet shrimp, but they offer to deep fry or make into miso soup the remaining shrimp head so that was a nice touch!

Scallop: you can tell that it was super fresh. It was so tender and soooo sweet, even people who don't like scallop will like this piece of sushi.

Salmon: normally I do not care for salmon during an Omakase course but the salmon here was amazing. So buttery it almost melted in my mouth.

Blue crab hand roll: like, come on, a whole hand roll for your Omakase course? I have never been anywhere else that served a hand roll, let alone blue crab! Need I remind you that the Omakase is $60?

Sushi Chitose is definitely an instant favorite. I would definitely come back because everything was perfect - food, service, ambiance, etc. I would highly recommend making a reservation here, especially at the bar if you're going for the Omakase.</Text>

The food is just normal, nothing extraordinary. Probably the place has a high rating because there are not a lot of sushi places around.

Minus 1 star for size of portions: twice smaller than what we used to get usually.
Minus 2nd star for the prices.
50 dollars for small portions of just OK food is too much surrounded by poor interior is too much.</review>

You won't find sugar in the rice, mayo in the rolls, or weird non-traditional rolls that are often times called "sushi" at other restaurants.

I'm picky as all hell, and this place earned my faithful business.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This is a good spot in Redondo where you can get Japanese style sushi (and typical made to order rolls). Flat price for Omakase - chef's choice handmade pieces with appetizer and dessert. A good selection of sake, good service and delicious food. Don't expect it to be out all together and don't expect to be stuffed from the set meals. Socialize, drink, taste and enjoy the nigiri and atmosphere at a slower pace. Sit at the sushi bar if you're going to order Omakase and make a reservation ahead of time during the weekend. They tend to get busy.< /text>< pictures>

This place is great for sashimi and less popular for rolls. They have a chef's choice special which seemed to be what everyone seems to order. Only note was they tended to be a little heavy on the wasabi.<//Text>

Overpriced and mediocre.
Don't assume you'll get a high quality food because it"s pricey and looks genuine.
Menu is very limited and fish variety is maybe 3 or 4.
And  don't order the rolls. Because you'll get undercooked rice with something like ground fish inside which I couldn't taste anything beside rice and seaweed.
Won't come back again.<//Review>

<text>The best of all worlds - incredibly fresh ingredients, superbly skilled sushi chefs, the owner/sushi chef is deeply committed to quality, and the wait staff is friendly, attentive and efficient,  This is traditional sushi - if you are looking for crazy rolls, go elsewhere.  Don't be put off by the "strip mall" exterior - this restaurant can hold its own against any high end traditional sushi bar.

The non-sushi menu is simple but also outstanding.  Perfectly prepared tempura (no grease, all fresh ingredients), the black miso cod would give Nobu a run for his money, and the spicy tuna salad is perfection.  There's more than this, as well.

Small but excellent selection of good quality sake's.

Extremely fair pricing - you'll pay a lot more in Los Angeles, and it won't be as good!

Finally, you must try the blue crab hand roll - this is a signature dish.

I dreaded writing this, because the place is small - if too many people go, less room for me and my family!!</text>< Pictures>

<Date>1616480489209</Date><rating>5</rating><Review>Couple of years ago, I went to Santa Clara to visit a Real Estate Agent. During that time I had some mortgage and rental properties real estate tax issues, I had to look for a CPA firm on Google. I found Bhuiyan & Associate, CPA on Google. I was in rush, without appointment, I went to Bhuiyan & Associates, CPA firm in Santa Clara. I was welcomed by Motin Bhuiyan without appointment at his office. After I reached his office. I explained all my rental property tax and mortgage tax issues, He listened carefully all tax related issues and explained me nicely. I  understand how to deduct mortgage interest along with other expenses associated with my rental properties can also be deducted ."
Bhuiyan & Associate CPA is an experience, knowledgeable , professional CPA firm, I ever seen before, who helped my 3 years back Tax.
I am so glad, I found him on time.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Matin helped me on the spot, since he had time between his appointments.  My CPA with another firm cancelled last minute due to a family emergency and wasn't available before my deadline, so I  Googled CPA and found Bhuiyan & Associates, CPA with great reviews.  Matin was knowledgeable and helpful.  Thank you Matin!</Review>< Date>

Bhuiyan CPA and his staff take the fear and uncertainty out of tax service. They listen to us with a genuine approach to understand our specific situation and continually give us advice like we are family. They have the proven experience we needed to feel confident in starting and running our business and they have provided us the peace of mind that no question or detail is too big or too small. We feel lucky to have their accounting expertise as a readily available resource and they are our trusted advisor for our business and personal taxes.<//text>

< Review>
Contrary to some of the "1 Star" reviewer's experiences, I have had nothing but cordial and transparent relations with this company. I went in recently to have some complicated taxes filed and was helped by Mr. Bhuiyan personally. Not only did he review everything I had provided in a systematic approach, he also drew upon some resources and deductions I did not know I qualified for. The work was completed, presented, and filed in front of me during the one visit. You know exactly what you paid for and are filing. Mr. Bhuiyan also provided tips and hints on how to help your upcoming tax reductions for the year ahead so you can plan accordingly; priceless.

He was very well mannered and of course the outward appearance of his office seemed what some have quoted as "messy", but again it is tax season and he was extremely focused amongst everything. In terms of pricing, we asked up front and he had a set price without ambiguity or "sketchiness". His pricing is extremely competitive for the area.

His office also provided stickers for the kids as well as snacks to munch on during the duration of the appointment. Parking is convenient and appointments are flexible.< /Review>

The tax session was quick and got some good advice.
Was able to get some concrete answers to questions which I was unsure about and couldn't find information online about.
I was also able to schedule an appointment at 7 p.m (i think you can schedule up to 9 pm!) so did not have to take time off from work. Most other firms usually have a 9 to 5 rule so this was really convenient.< /Review>

Brother Motin from Bhuiyan & Associates helped me with my first tax return!  I have to say, I was very pleased with his services.  Not only is he a friendly and patient tax preparer, he is very knowledgeable in his field of work.  I'm definitely coming back next year, and would recommend him to anyone looking for a tax preparer or someone to help them with large or small scale investments.<//review>

Me and my entire family have been coming to bhuyain for about 10 years now and we couldn't be happier with the services this company provides. The employees are organized, pay close attention to detail, really care about customer satisfaction and are very friendly and polite. The services are very affordable and their work ethic is efficient.  I would definitely recommend this company for anyone and everyone who wants to file taxes and/or deal with financial affairs hassle-free and affordably.< /Review>

Mr. Motin Bhuiyan is one of the most friendly and honest CPA I have worked so far. I used to file my taxes through other CPAs who would false promise me, I tried H&R Block, nothing comes even close to what Mr. Bhuiyan provides. They give you complete peace of mind and do your taxes according to rules and regulations. Since I have discovered them, whenever the tax season is around I just give them a call. And within hours they file my taxes. This year I gave them my W-2 at midnight and saw their email around 4 in the morning that my work is ready! Highly impressive. I highly recommend them!</Text>

< Review>
My experience with Bhuiyan CPA was good.  created an LLC in 2014 with 2 foreign partners, which made the tax returns more complex than usual. I was expecting, because of the unusual complexity of an otherwise simple return, that I would have to pay a steep fee. but no, the fee was small and I also received a lot of great advice and guidance that might have come with an extra charge at another company.
All in all, having Bhuiyan CPA do my tax returns turned out to be great value for money.
Mohammed provided me with a good tax savings strategies, Keep up the good work. Thanks< /Review>

Motin Bhuiyan, the owner and chief tax accountant, is the most friendly, honest and hard-working tax accountant you will ever work with.
I would highly recommend them if you are looking for Tax or Book Keeping services.</review>< Pictures>

I wish I could give negative stars. HORRIBLE experience. Not professional at all. Made us wait even after taking an appointment .VERY IMPATIENT just because we are having doubts and we have done a bit of our own research !!! He MISGUIDED us.  Would have made us lose $10k if we just nodded to what he said. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.<//Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>My advice to you guys don’t ever trust a cpa especially this guy always ask him what he is doing and how much he will charge you before doing anypaper work with him or you are going to be screwed,thats what happened to me cause am new here in the US and came to study and i was told that he is an honest guy and after i gave him the money and went back home and checked what he have done for me and i knew that he charged me alot for nothing and i could have done it for free cause its just a form you download online and its free and its not even for the taxs and he charged me 200$,
And cause my brother in law told me about him and he deals with him and i had no clue how much he will charge and didn’t ask cause of his reputation but he took advantage of me cause am new to this kind of stuff and trusted him.
And the funny thing after what happened i texted him and told him what you did is wrong and you took advantage of me and charged me alot for almost nothing so his reply was that he have to pay his bills and if i came in different time of the year he would have charged me ALOT CHEAPER and thats specifically what he said.
Bottom line don’t trust him unless you do your research and ask how much he will charge you for anything</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

BhuyanCPA has been helping me with my tax documents since 2007. I am travelling everywhere in the United States but I always knock Mr. Matin, when it’s come to tax filing. He is very organized and patient with my questions. Mr. Matin gives solid advice and take the stress out of tax season. I trust my taxes in his capable hands. Mr. Matin is extremely helpful. I highly recommend him.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I have been using the services of Bhuiyan & Associates, CPA, 2118 Walsh Ave, Santa Clara, CA 95050 for the last many years. Motin at Bhuiyan & Associates is the owner and a very reliable person. I have three W2s in my family, a couple of stock trades and kids's education expenses. All I did was to leave my documents with him for only three days and thats all. He called us for signing the final documents and my tax papers were out with the IRS on-line, the same day, right there. I am expecting the refund soon. I would highly recommend Motin at Bhuiyan & Associates as a reliable person. Just an FYI that he has staff with Viet, Bangla and Spanish language expertise also that can help in personnel or business tax. He charges very nominal amount of fees that are much much lower than other CPAs. That is another reason for maximum benefit by filing taxes with him.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We had a small business that was closed in 2009.  To add salt to injury, the IRS sent us a bill for $500k and a 3 year audit notice.  My savvy business friend said "Get Motin."

Motin certainly masters the audit game.  He knows how to organize and present data convincingly. Motin helped to conclude the audit in 4 months.  It was certainly not a cake walk, Motin delivered the best possible result, "no adjustment." The IRS sent us the refund owed plus interest.

Motin give us our piece of mind back.  Worth every penny!< /Text>

He is not at all professional and kept taking calls in between after making us wait. Did not bother answering our doubts clearly and was very impatient. He would have lost us more than $6k in refund if we hadn't done our own research and gone to the IRS tax assistance centre. Choose this place only as a  last resort.< /Review>< Pictures>

This management company is complete Nightmare and UNPROFESSIONAL!! Ran into a problem and spoke to a women (who I’m not naming on here) and she was the most rudest person I’ve talked to in my life(not kidding). She was extremely disrespectful to me and argued with me for 15min for a mistake they did! I’m trying to contact her boss to make a complaint and all of a sudden no one knows the number or email to give me. I am Compelled to write this review to let people know this place is an absolute joke and it is kind of sad to watch a company with great potential be dragged down by an unprofessional empty shell of a person. Absolute disgrace. If I could give 0 stars I would. It is a nightmare dealing with that person.< /Text>

This is the worst company!! They support their lying management! If 2 managers at the complex tell me something then you should abide by it. Rather the manager at the apartment complex said I was lying. Jodie is the worst! She doesn’t care no customer service they just go by whatever they want. Attitude for sure! Very unprofessional! I will be going to the better business bureau! Do not rent from this company! Any complex owned by them.</Review>

<Text>I live in a rental unit managed by Manco Abbott.  While I like the rental unit, the management company is about the worst I have ever dealt with.  They do not give timely notices of changes ( I received notification on the 6th that my lease must be renewed at the end of the month and my rent is going up but if I choose to  move out, I have to give 30 day notice.)  The State of California requires that landlords give tenants 30 days before changes to the lease agreement are made just as the tenant is required to give 30 day notice to the landlord.  I know that my next rental will NOT be a Manco Abbott property.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I paid till the last day of money rent., however, they are asking for three months’ rent in additional as notice (notice sent and acknowledged by their agent ) and penalty. However they got the notice and the key and rented plus they have been paid almost one year without occupying's the unit, Many apartments are waving rent at this time, but these guys are asking more than actual rent.
I do not recommend this place for anyone who seeks good place and good mamangmet. their alleged money will be disputed forever and raised on all websites and to all authority’s level< /review></record>

I have lived at the Stonegate apartments a little over 2 years, started in the 1 bedroom upstairs and i now have the upstairs downstairs townhouse. My daughter and I really like it here the office is always ontop of any requests or maintenance concerns, clean grounds, and overall safe and family friendly. Very affordable and nearby good schools and close freeway access. Highl

The Gates At Figarden is a beautiful, upscale community with many thoughtful amenities and great neighbors!  The location is ideal, with shopping, dining, and service needs surrounding us.   And to assure that our living experience here is a joy, our amazing resident manager, Heather, not only tends to all our concerns efficiently, but creates and encourages all kinds of social gatherings through which many friendships have developed!  We also have a friendly and competent handy person, Brad, who is always reliable and caring!  Love it here!<//Review>

My husband and I own a commercial roofing business that services the central valley. Manco Abbott has been one of the best property management companies  to work with. We have enjoyed being one of their vendors for four years. Their dedication and commitment to servicing their customers and tenants definitely stands out above others. The staff is always working their hardest to take care of each persons needs and are always super friendly to deal with. We highly recommend them!<//Review>

Just like Vue Day, same thing happened to me I asked if that was all I needed to do and they said yes three times while being recorded. Days later I had a 1,300 fee. Called Corp and they said “there’s too many callas to look through them” lol. I went to collections because they didn’t even tell me who I had to pay the fee to. Seems like abusing they’re power to get extra money out of tenants. I would really really want you to think bout it for a while. This company made my life spin a bit. Not worth it trust me !

Sadly i can only give them a 2 out of 5 stars for the time being. Ive lived here since 2015 and have had an ok experience so far. The previous manager had mishandled MANY other tenants accounts and had been accruing late fees due to balances not being communicated to us (late fees are $85 a month) and many of us have a big bill that we had no idea was happening.< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>At the time of the lease renewal, we specifically asked if there was anything further we needed to do before we left the office that day, Scotti Hoole, the assistant manager replied "No".

It was the wrong answer.

Based on the wrong information given by the assistant manager at Stonegate Apartments, automatic payment was not automatically applied upon the lease renewal and a late fee was summoned. It is no where mentioned in the contract that you have to reapply for automatic payment--clearly even their own staff did not know this procedure as she led us with the wrong information.

Poor management and their staff does not know enough about their job to give us honest answers.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>Lived in one of their apartments. While living here, our van got graffiti on it and a giant rock went through my bedroom window. When we moved in, there were stains throughout the house. After moving out, Manco Abbott took over $1000 out of our deposit due to "pet urine" in the carpet, in which they replaced. Our dog is over 14 years old and has not once peed, pooped, or vomited indoors since he was a puppy. They robbed us of $1000 because the apartment complex (Stonegate Apartments in Fresno, CA) did not see that that the carpet was already stained throughout the apt prior to us moving in. We even pointed out the stained when we moved in but the apartment complex refused to do anything about this. We took EXCELLENT care of this place and even spent DAYS cleaning it to the best of our abilities when we moved out. But they only gave us about $40 of our deposit back. I do not recommend Manco Abbott unless you are willing to lose money. Unless, of course, they are willing to work with us to get our money back. We might have to take this to a higher level than Google Reviews.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1498680439731, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear that your stay with us was less than satisfactory.

I have to admit this is the classiest property management company in the Fresno region. They take care of their people and properties better than any company in town. I know, because I deal with all of them.</review>

<review>I rent an apartment that is managed by Manco Abbott, Inc at Le Provence on E Foxhill Dr. I always love driving into the complex because the grounds are always kept clean and the foliage nicely trimmed. I truly like the attention to detail, as I sometimes see maintenance crew walking around dusting the inside covers of patio lights around the premises. In the 3 months of living there, I have had a total of 7 maintenance requests--all of which were completed within a 30-minute to 24-hour period (depending on the severity) and to my total satisfaction. The girls in the front office are extremely pleasant and helpful. Blake always greets me with a hug, which I love. They recently were able to track down an expensive delivery of mine that was delivered to the wrong apartment, within a very reasonable amount of time. The amenities offered, which are included in the price of rent, far exceed my expectations, and I love to take advantage of them all. Manco Abbott and Le Provence offer luxury living and they take it to the next level.

Before doing business with Manco Abbott, I did my research. I found Manco Abbott to be a good, sturdy company that was easy to work with. I was living in San Luis Obispo, and went through the entire application process through phone and email. I only saw photos of the apartment through pictures, and once I arrived to move in, I was not disappointed. It was the easiest application processes that I have ever gone through, and it wasn't even done face-to-face. Finally, I can always trust a business that is accredited and has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Truly an awful property management company. After we moved out, they attempted to not only keep our entire deposit, but also charge another $600 for "pet urine". We've never had any pet in our apartment. They actually accused us of stepping in it and tracking it back inside. What??!!
And when I called for clarification on the charges, I kept getting the run around until a few months later I received a collection summons from them. Terrible communication and customer service.
Renters beware, they don't care about anything but money.<//review>

For over 10 years Manco Abbot managed our apartment buildings in Fresno.They did an outstanding job. Each month we received incredibly detailed reports as to the income and expenses, a reconciliation of the budget versus actual income/expenses and commentary from the supervisor. Each week we received reports as to the number of vacancies, the traffic viewing the vacancies, the repairs that were in progress and the events that had taken place on the property. At tax time, they sent a reconciliation for the entire year which made our tax preparation a breeze! Greg Bethke was the supervisor who oversaw the our on-site mangers. I can't praise his work and dedication highly enough. We went through several disappointing management companies before finding Manco Abbot and never looked back after that. I would without a doubt hire Manco Abbot to manage any property I own.< /Text>

Complete bait and switch. They lie about the gym facility and knowingly give parking slots to tenants knowing that those slots have a history of car theft and vandalism.  There is also no guest parking. I live at Park Ridge Apartments. It is managed by Manco Abbott. This apartment complex that Manco Abbot manages claims to have a gym. It is a gym that they refuse to air condition. A gym that they keep at 80 degrees in July. Meanwhile the office right next door (two class doors link the office to the gym)  is where the manager and staff work and it is a nice and cool office where staff can do their paper work in comfort. We residents, who pay the staff's salary with our rent, have to cope with an 80 degree gym if we want to work out.  But the staff sit at their desks in a nice cool office. Residents are charged the same amount of rent as if the gym were in working order when it is not. Because an 80 degree gym in a hot Fresno summer feels more like sauna and therefore cannot be considered inhabitable for physical exercise.  Not to mention that the tv remote in the gym has been lost for 2 weeks and hasn't been replaced so you look at this tv with a blank blue screen that tells you to push OK to start it. Manco and Abbot are so deceitful and cheap that they refuse to pay for air conditioning in their gym and won't replace a tv remote.  I believe they really don't want anyone to use the gym. They just need the gym for show and to lure residents into the paying high rent at Park Ridge. Then Manco Abbot makes the gym so intolerable that no one will use it and if no one uses the gym then the equipment stays looking brand new and Manco Abbot doesn't have to purchase new gym equipment or make repairs. Meanwhile, if you moved to Park Ridge for the gym and signed a lease only to find the gym to be inhospitable then you'll just have to suck it up. As for the parking there is no guest parking. I've had friends have to park on the street on a Friday night. It's embarrassing. And they won't let you rent a a garage and keep your space, it's one or the other. Cars in parking slots are stolen or broken into. Last month two people woke up to find holes in the back windows of their cars.  The car that's assigned space #127 is always getting broken into since it's right by the walkway. Manco Abbott just keeps assigning this space to tenants. It's wrong to give a parking space to a renter when they know that the car in that space will likely be vandalized or the car will be stolen.  Manco Abbott seems to have no respect for their renters. They do whatever they need to lure residents here and fall short on their promises of a posh gym facility with cable tv and withhold information regarding high crime parking spaces.  Don't move to a Manco Abbott managed building. They'll likely offer you some sort of deal but don't take it. It's not worth it and you will regret it.<//review>

< Review>
With the abundance of cannabis clinics roaming in the San Fernando Valley, Famous Roots stands out as the most efficient and inexpensive way to receive top-shelf medicine at reasonable donation prices. I cannot stress how proficient they are at describing their product as I find their expertise to be more encouraging as I choose my medicine. The females working here create a comforting and relaxed environment which differs from the generally overused seductive, female-led sales. I shall continue to rely on Famous Roots for my medicine because they are reliable, they have a great location, and their products are on point with the top companies in the cannabis industry.<//Review>

The Best?? That's a joke!! They're super slow, the Bud-tenders act like they could really care less, horrible selection and prices! Don't waste your time here when One Stop Healers, which is really the best dispensary, is just 5 minutes away down Foothill!!</text>

I arrived at 2:15 and was told no way they’re too busy. Then when I told him i was the person who called and was told 2:30 he said I could wait for four other cars to be done and it would take over two hours to get to me.

I hate leaving bad reviews. But how can people do business like this????? Tell me to come the next open day. Be professional.</Review>< Rate>

<Text>I went to get my Grandmother's 2002 Toyota Camry a smog here and they had it done in 45 min flat. With 2 cars ahead of us. Terrific service. Been going now for the last 4 years. Two vehicles every 2 yrs.  Thank you for being so kind.< /Text>< pics>

I like everything from this location for my car.  The guy's who work there are really carrying & friendly.  They even gave some a deal for my car.  An estimated that I got from them, I liked it because is a little more to pay, but they guarantee their work.  That's something that you can't mist it.<//review>

If i could give this guy 0 stars i would. Not only is he a legit scam artist. He also charges everyone different prices. I went in A day before explaining to him that i have a new battery( new batteries need to run 80 miles or more to pass the smog... Everyone knows that). So we came in the next day and the guy went ahead and did the smog check before checking if my battery passed. So my car automatically failed. He asked us to come back, but we are not. (HE WANTS TO CHARGE US AGAIN). He also doesn't grant you the coupon ( saying SUVs and trucks cost more & the coupon states any car)... Im definitely reporting this guy.</Review>< resp>

Fast, friendly and convenient. Only took 10-15mins to get my car smogged got a great price and they will fax your smog paperwork directly to the DMV saving you time. I highly recommend this business, anyone that needs their car smogged come check this place out.< /Review>

Showed up for a smog check during business hours and the place was closed up tight.  The mechanic at the business next door suggested calling the smog guy and "maybe" he'd come in to do the test for me.  No answer.  Had to go somewhere else for the test and had a great experience.< /Review>

Dude working there has really Bad customer service you can tell he hates that job. Hours are not accurate and on top of that, guy is not experienced enough. Failed my car over a sticker ,  Went to a different smog shop and passed. I'd stay away if you dont have a newer car or if you like customer service.< /review>

Showed up at 9:50 AM on a Tuesday and nobody was there! Company left hand written note on door saying "Sorry for any inconvenience if we're not here". Well... I just drove from Olive Dr and sorry doesn't help me get a smog. Word of warning about this shop, you're rolling the dice coming here since the operators do not even open on time or when the hours say. Frustrating to say the least...< /Text>

<review>A little difficult to find, had to rely on signage posted in window of tire shop, and a couple of small A frames at the curb. There was no open/ closed sign, so I called the number on the on- line coupon, only to find out they opened at 9:30am, after being there at 8:30?? Also failed to honor the coupon , being told that I had an 8 cyl. engine , and it would be more $$$$..... Nothing noted on coupon in regards to this. Would not recommend this shop to anyone!!!</review>< userid>

<text>DO NOT GO HERE. This place is a cash grab and the smog technician will just charge you whatever he wants. Brought in a coupon advertised on his website and he refused to redeem it, saying that I wasn't purchasing the correct type of smog. He also failed to mention that if your check engine light is on it's an automatic fail. He tested anyways and charged me. I know it's supposed to be courtesy, but it is apparent that this business has none.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I got there at 9 am which was the time it said it was supposed to open but, he didn’t get there till 9:30 so after I waited half an hour for him to get there  I asked him if he could smog my 1992 f150 and he told me no, even though there was a sign right behind his head that stated “ we smog everything”.<//Text>< user>

This place sucks, he refused to smog my truck because it was a 1998 dodge ram, he said he had appointments & that's why he couldn't do it even though the place was dead & he was just sitting there being lazy. So I left & called him saying I needed a 2005 car smoged and he said he had no appointments to come by I then said it's me from the 1998 Dodge ram I thought you had appointments. He said it takes too long then clicked...it only takes 45 min to smog my truck all other cars take about 25-30 min. F this place!..</text>

I first call and ask how much will it be with the coupon and everything and he says $45. I show up with my coupon and dmv paperwork, he says "oh coupon is only for regular smog, you need a STAR smog, i can do it for 10 dollars extra and there's a debit card fee for $2." Don't come here they're just wanting to take your money, take your business somewhere else!< /Review>

This place should be investigated by BBB. Took the car in 4 times the guts couldn't get it to pass so drove down to another smog service and it passed in a few minutes.< /text>

<review>Atlantis is very narrow street. The gate is at the south end. They unload my trailer in one hour and 20 minutes. Clean yard. Friendly people.< /review>< Pics>

But something happened after quarantine. Either new management or something else. They became to be a very nasty receiver. They are by appointment only now, but at the same time they can change the appointment  anytime before your delivery time. No one cares and they are like sorry, reach out your broker or Tesla.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Maybe cause they recently reopen but there was a long line of trucks waiting to get unloaded.  Got there around 4am and left 7:30pm!!! Probably 20-30 trucks parked around the warehouse and outside on the street waiting. Old security guy at night is cool and also lady at the receiving office. Uber eats not deliver to this location, no restroom either. Overall, the whole day wasted and not so great experience.</Review>

Best jerky place I have found long ago. Being a Singaporean, I missed these jerky flavors and textures. The way they make them is exactly the same as they are in Singapore. I do prefer the pork than the beef, it is much more tender.<//Review>

<user>109276198786312078883</user><Text>Came here looking for coconut soup like I have gotten from the East Coast.

The place is in a nice little plaza, and has petty nice and clean decor. The staff was friendly and she made sure that I understood that the soup has some spice to it. (Not that I have an issue with spice)

The soup was absolutely delicious and reminded me of the restaurants I frequented back home, and I will be back to try the rest of their cuisine!< /Text>< Resp>

I found this place is better than the one on N.Y. The jerkies we tried  were very good.  Because it is Singapore style, they are sweet and not savory. We tried the regular beef, spicy beef, pork n also the bacon.  Really like the bacon jerky.  Is we go back to L.A., I would buy their jerky again.< /review><Name>Sally Wong</Name><Gmap_id>0x80c2da8dd0de7b6b:0x3a39ef469b087949< /Gmap_id>< rating>

Must Try Restaurant. Menu has a lot of options which lets you want to try each one. Prices are very cheap yet the food is amazing. I come here often and every time, I am satisfied. I recommend the unique Stone Bowls.< /review>

This is the second meal pal at this restaurant and i would like to say they're so thoughtful they separated the soup from the noodles to prevent it from soggy noodles. The white curry was so good I wanted more after finishing! The drunken noodles from my first meal pal was also very good nice n spicy kick!< /review>

<text>Real Singapore-style pork jerky, bak kwa. I was buying this weekly. The various variety of jerky include original pork slices, bacon, coin, spicy, beef. Family run. Friendly staff. They have mail order in the United States and you can get a sealed package in the mail pretty quickly.< /text><time>1567227328764< /time>< resp>

I like their friendly and approachable personnel, the quality of their products.  I like their packaging. Good for gifts at Christmas and New Year.  I recently placed an order with Fragrant Jerky to send to a relative in L.A. area.  The package was lost (or stolen) en route to the destination.  I later found out that the address was incomplete because I was given the wrong address.  I called up Fragrant and Jeff answered the phone.  I could tell they were real busy from the background noise and Jeff was catching his breath.  I was amazed that he still answered the phone in spite of the hectic holiday orders.  He also called me after work hours as a follow up.  That's what I call PERSONAL TOUCH.  How often you have a life personal answering the phone to talk to you?  And how often you get personal assistance right away particularly during such busy holiday retails.  I have no doubt that Fragrant Jerky will, if not already has, become very successful and keep growing if they maintain their personal touch.  The story does not end there.  Jeff replaced the order without charge and sent it out to my relative the next morning and they received it just in time for the holiday.  I offered to buy for it because it was my fault to have given them an incomplete address causing the loss of the package, but Jeff would not charge it.  They now make a regular customer of me.  I've actually placed two other orders at the same time and each was received promptly.  And all the recipients are happy with the quality and taste.</text>

<Review>I order from WMalaysia Beef Jerky, at work and I've never been disappointed. Food arrives hot + quickly, and is SO good. You must get the Roti with the potato curry sauce - it's divine. I've also tried Mee Siam, Penang Char Kway Teow, and Penang White Curry Laksa so far, and I'm working my way around the menu.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2da8dd0de7b6b:0x3a39ef469b087949<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We brought two bags of Singapore jerky (they called in ROUGAN or BAK KWA in Singapore) back to LA over our Christmas trip to Singapore but one bag was confiscated by US custom agent at LAX but my husband’s bag was not discovered :) so we very much remember the taste... o so so good!!!.  Fragrant Singapore Jerky in Rosemead tasted very authentic and much the same to the Singapore version… in fact my husband preferred the one we brought from Rosemead because of the meat texture and flavor of US pork meat.  I think they are the only Singapore Jerky shop in the US.  I highly recommend jerky lover to try it.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>This was an incredible experience. Both sales associates were going out of their to assist all of the customers. Answering all of their questions and being so polite. I only came in for boots, but decided to purchase insoles in my own. There was no attempt to up sale additional products. I would highly recommend this store.< /text><time>1604384136179< /time>< Gmap_id>

My first time buying work boots 👢 and had a lot of choices but the reputation of this company is big in between workers...very happy with my purchase! Love the fact that they will replace or fix anything that brakes on your shoes...good job guys!!<//review>

I live in Riverside, the Riverside Redwing store closed many many years ago. So I drove to the Moreno Valley. The Moreno  Valley location wouldn't exchange the boots I bought 2 days ago with my receipt from the San Bernardino location. Mark the salesman told me returns have to take place at the original store of purchase. So I drove to the San Bernardino location Dave & Greg helped me locate a new pair of boots at the Fontana location. Because of the hassle of me driving from Riverside to Moreno Valley to San Bernardino, they refunded me my money. I drove to Fontana and to my surprise they had 2 pairs of 8 wide steel toe water proof boots. I bought my boots and went on my way. Redwing is and will always be a great boot company. Shop the San Bernardino and Fontana location's, I might even try Corona. But I would bypass the Moreno Valley location all together or at least until they re train Mark the sales clerk who refused my exchange on proper customer service.< /text>

I love red wing boots!!! Fontana is by far the best store I have visited . Safety is truly a must for me and the amount of care, knowledge they have is outstanding! Plus the free shoe laces, free cleanings and free minor repairs just put the cherry on top ! Thank you for all your help.</Text>

<review>Stopped by the Fontana location to shop for some boots. I was greeted and helped by the friendliest staff who were pretty informative and helped with any questions and concerns I had.
To my surprise they actually carry women's welding boots! I purchased a pair and they are not only durable but super comfortable. Big thanks to all the ladies that work there! Makes me happy to see more women in our field of work and now they're the ones operating a Red Wing Shoe Store. Great place!<//review>< user_name>

<Review>I went in to get my work boots cleaned and oiled. Only to find out that there was a little spot that got my foot wet and they're supposed to be waterproof so they replace my boots for free. That's so awesome I had no idea they did that. Red Wing Shoes has an awesome warranty on their products and they stand behind their name 100%. I would not buy any other work boots other than Red Wing Shoes and Boots. I love my Red Wings, William Wilson.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Stopped in here for another pair of work boots. By far the  most comfortable boot any one can wear Red Wing boots. I've tried them all  Danners,Whites,Ariat,Georgias,Die Hard,Justins,Thorogood,wolverine's,timberlands,etcThis place has excellent customer service very knowledgeable about there boots and sizes. Give them a try. Stopped in yesterday 7/25/20 @5pm to buy another pair of work boots. The guy opened the door and said sorry this is my last customer, I'm not taking anymore customers.  I told him I called before coming and they said they close @6pm. They lost a  valued customer I wont be returning to this store EVER. They had 5 stars I wish I could give NO stars.<//text>

Boots are ok,  but they wear out way too fast and are overpriced.  Once month and the steel toe is exposed already.  Same as last several pairs.< /Text>

I don't generally write reviews, but I felt it was necessary to offset the negative reviews.  I have actually been avoiding this store for some time due to the bad reviews, but my feet were killing me and I KNOW Red Wing shoes are the most comfortable work shoes I have ever owned.  The gentleman manning the store greeted me as soon as I walked in, he was both friendly and knowledgeable, and took the time to go through several sizes of shoes based on the information from their foot analysis machine to find the right boots for me.  Put them on and the heel pain was instantly gone just like the last time I bought a new pair of red wings.  They also gave me a military veteran discount.  I would recommend this place to anyone who was looking for a great pair of work shoes.</Review>

< review>
Don’t usually shop at fancy footwear stores buh I really needed a pair of boots that feel comfortable  and will actually last. Anyways I went to redwings in Fontana and the ladies in the store really pulled thru and took their time to get me the perfect pair of boots I don’t usually do reviews buh after a week it’s the best decision I could have done! really satisfied with the visit and would highly recommend this store.<//review>

<text>You better call first before driving all the way over there.  Just left there and there was a sign on the door out to lunch until 4pm.  Sucks for those of us who drive an hour away for them to be closed for lunch at dinnertime.

Customer service is bad. I've gone a couple of times and the employees really seem uninterested in helping you. Whenever they do help they act as if they really don't care to. Taking my business elsewhere. Thanks but no thanks Red Wing.<//Review>

Drove here for a cleaning and polishing.  Told that I would have to leave them overnight because they only had one employee on hand and couldn't do it.  I don't have time to come back as I am from out of town, a little frustrated to have my time wasted.< /text>

Great service. They were very nice and very polite. There food was amazing!! I'm a trucker and I travel all across the U.S and have eaten in a lot of ramen places and this one i can honestly say is on my list of places to visit again when I got another delivery going to the area. Keep up the good work and the good food. I'll see you guys next time ^_^<//review>

<text>First time visit definitely the beef ramen i have ever had.
Spicy miso was delicious the spiciness was very subtle. One bowl will fill you up, by far best in town would definitely come back here worth the 2 hour drive from downtown LA!!</text><time>1618713659698<//time>< username>

I recommend ordering from here. Please read towards bottom about the packaging.. being grocery style paper bag or your own. Not packed for driving AT ALL JUST HEADS UP..  So...Fast online order. Was ready before expected time and was notified as well👌🏽👍🏼 Food was plenty warm by the time I got home. They were very friendly.  If you read this Ten Gu Ramen,  I will suggest thinking of a different way to pack the food.  We are driving usually on a pick up. The tower stack method is plastic bag doesn't work.  Constantly I had to grab food as containers fell on side.  The broth container being one.  Very frustrating when trying to drive.  Please invest or come up with a driving friendly packing.  Maybe paper bag with containers spread out at bottom so us drivers can set on seat or ground so it all stays in place.  One on top of each other straight up does NOT work.  Besides that which I feel has nothing to do with rating, the food was great!!! Thank you Ten Gu.   I recommend to order from Ten Gu< /text>

<Text>I had the chashu ramen. The ramen was perfectly cooked. The broth was good, but lacked something I could not quite pinpoint. Maybe not as rich of flavor I have had at other ramen places. The soft boiled egg was perfect. The pork was soft and flavorful. 8/10< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This Ramen spot is really special. It's unlike anywhere else ve been, and the pork bun is delicious, especially for people that like a small spicy. The ramen soup is very tasty!< /Review>

The ramen was delicious, especially for the price, considering that ramen in Cali can go for 20+ dollars. So if you are looking for a lower price point, this is an option that you should consider seriously.</Text>

We went for an early dinner at 5pm, it was great. Best hangover food. It's like a little slice of Korea. I can't remember the last time wait staff opened the door for me. My noodles were just the right spiciness and my wife doesn't like onion but she really enjoyed her noodles.<//Review>

I had an excellent experience here with my family.  The bowls were very large and filled with a large amount of food. I didn't have to wait long for service, and the staff even offered forks when theysaw my wife and son having trouble with the chopsticks.  I definitely enjoyed my experience and suggest it at least once.<//Review>

Very good ramen. It was spicy but I added chili oil to it because I just like spicy food. Our waitress was awesome. We tried the spicy cucumber and spring roll appetizers and they were delish. Just wished the spicy cucumber was a bit more fermented and it would of been soo good. We will be going back for sure</Review>

I'd place this right above O ramen that's located on Ming ave.. two amazing places to check out, but make Ten Gu your 1st choice. Beer is tasty and smooth, the Thin and thick ramen are absolutely delicious I had to try both. The service is incredibly polite and the atmosphere is quite and very chill. Only one downside is the fact that it is very small. Not sure how many people can eat there, but I'd bet around 45-50 people can dine in at a time before you'd have to wait outside. I'll keep passing by to give them my patronage.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80ea41dc5cf2083d:0x43f1ab4cecfe72d7<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Menu has variety of food selection (not just ramen), good selection of beer and sodas. On top of delicious food, nice music, service was amazing and restaurant itself clean and pretty. Definitely will be visiting again and suggesting everyone doing the same.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>So I have never been to this restaurant before, but I have been to other ramen places, and I’ve never seen a place that Freezes their already hard boiled eggs or at least fully thaws them out before serving. The pork belly in the ramen was also cold. The broth was the worst part, it tased like boiled water and had no flavor. My friend that I took with me ordered a chicken ramen, and said it tasted like standard packet ramen. I will personally not come here again.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ea41dc5cf2083d:0x43f1ab4cecfe72d7<//Gmap_id></record>

I've been to several ramen places in Bakersfield and I would have to say this would be my go to (Kamisama [mehh], O Ramen [just alright], Re-mix [great quality, but pricey]). The service is great, place is clean and food was really good.

Service - The restaurant is not that big (commercial building, next to Jamba Juice) so staff is small (2 waiters, 2 chefs, 1 in back). Although they are small, the wait staff was very attentive and polite. The space may not be ideal for big parties, and  they do offer take-away.

Food - In my opinion, this ramen joint would be up there with the ones I've tried in L.A., just to give you a comparison. So the first time I came I had the Chashu (pork) Ramen, the amount of Chashu you get is plenty compared to other places in Bakersfield. This time, I got the chicken which had a good amount of chicken as well. They do have seafood, vegetable, and spicy options available. The main reason why I favor this place is the type of noodles. It doesn't taste like the cheap kind, and you have a choice between thick or thin. I do not like noodles that are over cooked and mushy, and this place cooks it just the way I like it. Presentation is on point with green onion, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and of course an egg.

They also offer a variety of rice bowls and appetizers. Soft drinks are available in a can with ice, and plenty of Japanese alcoholic beverages.

Hopefully you will give this place a try!</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The soft crab wasn't good but the spicy cucumbers, kimchi, and the spicy miso ramen was delicious.  The spicy pork ramen wasn't that good to me.  I am excited to see what else they have to offer.  The decor was great and the service was excellent.< /review>

Sad day in Thai food History. Food is not spicy and they will not make it spicy for you. The broth has no flavor sad. I urge you people to try oh-ramen here in bakersfield they have the best ramen here in bakersfield.

I order a spicy soup and Tapatio is way spicy.<//text>

Just horrible This is really sad this place is only for people who don’t know what real ramen is the ramen broth doesn’t really taste good the noodles itself are not good either but what made me dislike it more was the egg they give you a hard boiled egg it’s not even yolk wasn’t runny I sat at the table waited for my ramen to be done I tasted it and left to get some ramen at “Oramen” and I got the Usual a tantamen ramen I would rather eat a cup of ramen then to eat at TEN GU RAMEN any day it just tasted microwaved</text>

(Translated by Google) The shop in lane 133, the alleyway are easy to find, decorated like the common Japanese restaurants in the movie: D. The restaurant is quite few guests, quiet. . The price compared to the Japanese food is cheap, of course, the food size is also "cheap". A bowl of regular ramen noodles (you can order more topping and charge extra), my stomach is only half-empty (I probably eat a lot of hic). Hard noodles, light broth, are generally of medium quality. But cheap so should be acceptable. Fried scallops eat ok. Haven't ordered other side dishes so don't know, maybe come back later to try, especially rice: D. There is only one waiter who is the owner, right? Serve quite a long time. Not suitable for those who are in a hurry to eat and drink. On the table there are available food tick sheets, what to eat then tick and give to the mistress. It is recommended that even if she ticks sometimes she will forget to make sure to eat)), like me, I ordered some more topping in the bowl of noodles and the noodles brought out nothing and ate as well as supplemented. Topping ordered more but at least ate the scent of flowers. The owner is very very friendly and fun offline. Of course also forget. For example, the 4th day when going to eat ramen was discounted but did not remind her that she did not remember.

Quán trong ngõ 133, ngõ to, quán dễ tìm, trang trí trình bày giống như những quán Nhật bình dân trong phim ý :D. Quán khá ít khách, yên tĩnh. . Giá cả so với mặt bằng chung đồ Nhật là rẻ, tất nhiên kích cỡ đồ ăn thì cũng "rẻ" theo. Một bát mỳ ramen thường (có thể gọi thêm topping và tính tiền thêm), vào bụng tớ chỉ được lưng lửng bụng thôi (chắc tại mình ăn nhiều hic). Sợi mì cứng, nước dùng nhạt, nói chung là chất lượng bậc trung. Cơ mà giá rẻ nên tạm chấp nhận được. Sò điệp chiên ăn ok. Chưa gọi các món ăn kèm khác nên ko biết, chắc sau sẽ quay lại thử, nhất là cơm :D. Quán chỉ có một người phục vụ là chủ quán luôn thì phải? Phục vụ khá lâu. Không phù hợp cho những ai đang cần ăn uống vội vàng đâu nhé. Trên bàn ăn có sẵn tờ tick đồ ăn, ăn gì tick vào đó rồi đưa cho cô chủ. Khuyến cáo là dù có tick đôi khi cô ấy cũng sẽ quên nên phải nhắc cho chắc ăn )), giống tớ gọi thêm mấy cái topping trong bát mì mà mì mang ra chẳng thấy gì thế là vừa ăn vừa bổ sung luôn. Topping gọi thêm nhưng mà ít lắm ăn hương ăn hoa thôi ạ. Được cái cô chủ rất rất rất thân thiện vui vẻ nhé. Tất nhiên cũng hay quên. Tỷ như ngày thứ 4 đi ăn mì ramen được giảm giá nhưng ko nhắc là cô ấy ko nhớ đâu ạ.< /Review>

We were on a getaway from our kids on the East Coast. We are so grateful to Dawn and the entire staff for our wonderful stay. Our canyon suite was absolutely beautiful and we were able to enjoy the patio and pool immensely. The grounds are beyond stunning and lend a very tranquil, relaxing feel to the property. We are already dreaming about our return!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This hotel is great because it gives discounts to returning visitors! Their generosity astounds me. This is a meal that everyone should prepare! I'd like to come here!< /Review>

This place is an oasis in one of California’s most beautiful regions. While you’re 5-10 minutes from the city, shops and restaurants, you feel like you’re in a remote country getaway. The terraces open up to fresh wooded air, quiet, and beautiful gardens with swans and flowing creek. It’s something quite magical. The rooms are modern and the staff is off the charts helpful and friendly. I came here to do a stop over from a road Trip and brought my bike with me. There are some great rides along Mulholland Dr, through the canyons, Griffith Park and Santa Monica beachside ride. So if you like the outdoors, this is yet another reason to stay here. It’s my favorite  destination in California along with the Ritz Carlton in Santa Barbara.<//Review>

This property has just been renovated so you'll enjoy beautiful rooms and nice comfy bathrooms with a separate shower. I like the bar staff and the outdoor area is nice to sip a drink or have a cup of coffee.
I liked the spa which is located next to the gym. Service in the hotel is up to the "Hotel Bel-Air standard" with all staff being very attentive and gracious.The cafe in the hotel (not Noe) is not so great. I had a casear salad with green chili sauce--it wasn't pleasant.<//text>

Great hotel with affordable price. Their "social hour" with free drinks worked as a great warm-up before my husband and I left for dinner. Great location  with lots of options of dining and things to do. The staff was kind enouugh to allow us to leave our luggage in the hotel for four hours after checkout, so we had a chance to go out before heading home.<//Text>

staff here was really great. above and beyond in terms of friendliness and eagerness to help. from the valet to the bellhop to the front desk guy--each person provided stellar service. I'd stay here again. but watch out parking is $48--although that's comparable to the lots in the area.< /Text>

Our second visit was flawless (I said in my last review that this was a place you'd want to come back to again and I meant it). The HBA doesn't rely on flash and superficial luxury to impress. Superb comfort, attention to detail, and quality of service is what sets it apart. The staff is truly the best I've seen in all my travels and you can feel they enjoy and have a genuine pride in managing their guests. Even though it's exactly what we came for, still amazed again by how private the property is despite being a quick drive from all that LA has to offer.If you've never stayed at the HBA, do yourself a favor and try it at least once, and I guarantee you'll want to come back. If you've been here before, enough said, you know what I mean.<//text>

The Hotel Bel-Air is a rarity in LA where most 5-star hotels offer friendly but casual (ie loose) service. The HBA staff is top quality and ride the fine line between friendly and formal with aplomb. The atmosphere, rooms, and facilities are the most private you'll find in LA without having to drive hours out of the city. The menus for the restaurant and in-room dining don't seem all the special at first glance but each seemingly regular item is prepared to perfection. This is not your standard hip and stylish LA 5-star boutique hotel. The HBA exudes comfort and class and makes you feel like you're on vacation at a resort. A true getaway in the city, this is a place you'll want to come again and again... and again.<//review>

There are a handful of high class and historic hotels in Beverly Hills. Then there is the Pink Palace... aka the Hotel California.  A magical place full of old lore and legend. It was here two years before BH even became a city. When it comes to reliving the past glory days of Old Hollywood, this is as close as you will come. The staff here is impeccable and do not put on any airs. They even parked our Cadillac and Camaro right up front with the Rolls and Bentleys. When you stay or visit THE Beverly Hills you too become part of the story and the tradition. And as the song goes, "You can check out any time you like but you can never leave!"< /Review>

The staff and room are super dog friendly. The room was clean and private with secure courtyard parking right off Washington Blvd, very close to the Marina and downtown. The cafe has a great menu with good coffee and the owners (managers?) are very friendly and respectful. Very clean rooms with a nice breakfast nook and small kitchenette.
I spent the New Year with my Labrador Pele. She mostly slept and comfortably spent some of her final days here.<//Text>< Pics>

Absolutely fantastic! My husband and I booked this last minute after a very stressful travel day and within minutes of walking in, we were upgraded to a nicer room and given a complimentary bottle of wine since we had missed their "sipping hour"! The customer service from Jared was outstanding! The room is beautifully decorated and the bed is very comfortable!</Review>

He was very understanding and apologetic, which I appreciated.
He refunded half our money, and gave me two free nights in one of their large suites, free of charge.
These gestures were appreciated, and thoughtful. When a business takes responsibility and does what they can to make things right, I have much respect and grateful for that.
One star off for the first bad experience.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Had an absolutely wonderful stay here. Though it was too brief, had a great night sleep and two of the best meals I’ve had at any hotel, anywhere in the world.
The room was clean and quiet. The outdoor fireplace and hot tub/pool was very relaxing at the end of a couple long days.
Every single staff member was helpful and courteous. Hope to make it back someday and looking forward to checking out their other properties on my travels.< /Text>

Service and amenities stand out here; staff are pleasant and always willing to help in any matters. Room upgrade was given to us for free as the room we were to stay in was not ready yet. Seamless valet and restaurant service. Really lives up to the hype and expectations!< /Review>

Me and my boyfriend Cameron went. And we loved it. The pool, hot tub and spa was relaxing. The wine and beer at Bar 19 was amazing and good. The Polo Lounge food was really good and the servers were really nice. The rooms were nice and clean and modern. And we had fun at the tennis court<3 Definitely recommend and coming back soon< /review>

I just visited the hotel for lunch for the first time. I was impressed
with the food and service. I really enjoyed the tour of the property
with Steve Sorg. The grounds are beautiful' and well kept. I am
looking forward to returning soon for a weekend stay.< /Text>

Another plus, we were driven in their courtesy vehicle which is a Rolls Royce ghost.  Never in my life did I feel pampered and special, during my stay at this Four Seasons location. What a memorable stay!!

Overall, it's worth every penny to stay here, as pricey as it is, it's a great treat if you're on a budget.

Absolutely, I will be back, and for an LA area hotel, this is the place to stay.  Enough said....<//text>

<review>I have stayed at luxury hotels all over the world, in terms of service and hospitality, nothing comes anywhere close to the Beverly Hills Hotel. I would go back to LA just to stay there. I highly recommend the bungalow experience - grab a bottle of champagne, light the wood burning fireplace, put your feet up and stay in for the night.  Thank you to all of the fantastic crew that make this hotel great!!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA_1E81u0O4Y-yBS6CAh-HAAkYx-qDQYDQ9z6y=w150-h150-k-no-p']},

Came here for a charity event and was very impressed with the hotel. Incredibly friendly staff and beautiful decor. Excellent location close to Beverly Hills and West Hollywood.
Valet parking took a while to get the cars as it was a big event and they were super busy.</review>

This is by far the best and most luxurious hotel in the Greater Los Angeles area! The rooms are beyond elegant with the finest decor and materials. Service is exceptional everywhere in the hotel and it's restaurant, while very expensive, deserves at least 1 Michelin star. Expensive parking.< /Review>

This restaurant was truly amazing.  We were here celebrating a friends birthday at a dinner with about 10 people.  The food was terrific.  Risotto was incredible and the rib eye was to die for.  Great atmosphere, good vibe, friendly staff.<//Text>

Beautiful hotel centrally located in downtown LA. Our stay started out a bit rocky, but the customer service more than made up for it. All it took was one call, and Toi absolutely took care of us. Management should take note, Toi exemplifies what customer service should be, and we truly appreciate her effort. She went above and beyond to rectify the issue, and that made all of the difference. Thanks, Toi!</text>

<Date>1592903863671</Date><rating>5</rating><Review>The Beverly Hills Hotel is such a wonderful little place!   It is so clean it's amazing!   Super comfortable everything!  Kitchenette w fridge, microwave and coffee maker and all the supplies. I was here for the second time, but this time during the pandemic.  I would go NOWHERE else during this time.  I knew from my first visit how impeccably clean they are, so I wasn't worried.  I'm sure they added extra precautions, it smelled so clean and taken care of.  But it did before too.  Fatima is a total gem!  Her husband too!   They go out of their way for your comfort and safety.  Love them, their Villa and all that they do!  Oh!  Their cafe with home cooked amazing meals is the icing on the cake.  The food is wonderful!  And well worth every penny!   Delivered right to your room!   Thank you Fatima and team!</Review>< pictures>

Cute place and very quaint. Friendly staff. Nice owners who helped us when my mother booked a room for three of us and she didn't have a place for her medical device. So they were very accommodating and understood.</Review>

Amazing. Low key elegance. The hotel itself is just incredible, the rooms are large and comfortable. For drinks head over to Nineteen, the bar. For food and drinks, the Polo Lounge is historic. The grounds are just all Palm trees and the tropical foliage is just perfect. I love this place. A true oasis in the city.<//Review>

What a joy.  My wife and I are wrapping up a five night stay in this dreamboat place. When we were here, the bustle of LA disappeared.  This is a very special place.  The rooms aren't large, but they are immaculate.  I don't know how I'll wrap up the day without a passionfruit mousse -- the restaurant is also adorable< /text>

I thought there might be something rather pleasant about taking morning tea at the Four Seasons. I even dressed up for the occasion, because you want to look your best in a swanky place like this. where the crowd's sure to be classy.<//text>

This place is amazing, a real hidden gem.  Everyone is super nice and it has an amazing atmosphere.  The rooms are a bit small, but very clean and suitable.  Nice bathroom, HD flatscreen, mini fridge, desk, and breakfast bar.  There are also little hang out spots outside your rooms.  They have chairs and tables to lounge at.  There is also an awesome cafe as well.

Overall, it's cheap, great people and service and more than fairly priced.  STAY HERE, you will be satisfied.<//Review>

Came to the pool bar and cabana. Really a nice place for a midday light meal. Salads are very nice and the poke bowl was excellent. Outside seating is cool and very comfortable. Staff very nice and helpful. Wonderful relaxing time.< /review>

<review>Was craving avocado toast. This is not in Larchmont. The avocado toast looked much better in the pictures, it was not as toasty....also had the Vietnamese coffee, they put way too much half and half and it was very bland. Not the best experience.

I had the best experience ever! The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you feel at home, that are happy and feel catered to. They treat everyone like a movie star. I couldn't complain about absolutely anything. 5 stars!!</Review>

Solid 4.5 stars
Clean, quiet and friendly staff
Only issue was I'm not crazy about hotel rooms that are carpeted.  My guess is they do it to reduce noise from people walking around on floors above you.< /Review>

<review>I love this place! I stumbled upon it by blind luck during a visit to west LA. I had been very dissatisfied with the options on the big travel sites. It was very expensive (roughly $120+) to stay at the main hotel chains, and apparently they aren't even that great. So, stuck in traffic on the 405 near Culver City I'm checking Yelp for what other options I have close by. Villa Brasil popped up and they had great reviews. Out of sheer curiosity I stopped by to take a look. It was $85 a night that weekend and I asked if I could preview the room. The manager was very nice and agreed without hesitation.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

There are many choices for luxury hotels in this area. We HIGHLY recommend The Beverly Hills Hotel because of Momodou at the front desk.

An absolutely beautiful property (in the land of many beautiful, famous hotels), but it's the service that makes The Beverly Hills Hotel stand out.< /text>

Attempted to attend the holiday market, but they were immediately at capacity. They didn't have the parking capacity or adequate manpower to inform the endless line of cars that they wouldn't be allowed in. Looked like the attendants were selectively allowing cars in. This event should consider  utilizing a shuttle service and partner with a nearby school for additional parking. Was really hoping to enjoy the hotel and this beautiful event.</text>

The owner made me feel welcomed (not the over the top fake nice, but genuine). Nice comfortable sitting area in the front of every room, tea light candles gave it the extra touch at nite, breezegy (even on a hot afternoon), AC is nice & cold, kitchen w/ sink (coffee maker & microwave, small refrigerator),< /Text>

While I was perfectly happy with almost everything at the Four Seasons, I regret that it wasn't a little grander in ways that are fitting, firstly for a prestigious hotel in Beverly Hills, and secondly for the outfit I was wearing. Would it be too much trouble to introduce a designated dress code? Then I wouldn't have to stare at someone else's bare hairy thighs while I'm eating. Of course, my raised expectations are not the management's fault. Nonetheless, I'm deducting one star - and one entire Season - for this.</Text>

Hotel Bel air is in a beautiful canyon and the Christmas lights with the other decor give you a great holiday spirit. The garden vegetation along with the pond and swans give you a serene feeling of being in paradise. The rooms are clean and tranquil. The masseuses were excellent and a must to add to a wonderful experience!< /Text>

I was a little skeptical because of the bad reviews but boy was I wrong. Me and my girlfriend got a three night stay through Priceline. The people in the front counter were very nice. The valets were nice people as well. We order r food one night through Uber eats and we're not provided utensils in our bag. Luckily, a very nice elderly security guard came up to the fourth floor and provided us with silverware, that was going above and beyond and I greatly appreciate that. I would not mind staying here again. Thank you The Beverly Hills Hotel<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Date>1576760361993</Date><Rating>5</Rating><review>This is my favorite hotel in Los Angeles. Tucked into a wooded canyon in the exclusive Bel Air neighborhood.  It's a small five star property offering suite-like accommodations at a premium price.  It offers an upscale restaurant, bar catering, room service, concierge services, car and driver, business center. When l was there it was b owned by Rose which also operates the Ranch at Hana on Maui, the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, and the Remington in Houston.  All of which are extremely plush, highly rated hotels and offer only the finest accommodations and service.  The Bel Air is also one of the most desired place outside Mañibu to have your wedding and reception. Outstanding property,and if $700 a night and up is in your budget this is where to stay.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>The room was average size, but had everything I needed. Wall-mounted TV, wi-fi, clean bathroom and shower, heater/AC, refrigerator, microwave, kitchen sink. It was very clean. My bed happened to be pink, which was interesting...and my bedside lamp was pink as well...hmmm...

Parking was great, atmosphere was pleasant and most of the people staying there seemed to be older. Overall a very charming place and great place to spend the night. Very conveniently located too, it's right off the 405 and really close to all of West LA.</Text>< Pictures>

Clean, attentive to details which is what you expect here, and it is what you get. I have been coming here for many years. It is nice to see people that I have gotten to know over the years. The Fountain shop, Polo Lounge, are excellent. Worth noting- the CONCIERGE are the BEST. They do their homework, know the area. Great ideas to plan out your day, any sites, restaurants, or simply very trustworthy. If I got lost, they stayed on the cell until I was at my site, or safely back at the hotel. Having stayed at other supposed 5 star hotels, and asked their concierge questions, they did not know their area. I always compare, they are not the BHH.
Few concerns. But I know that they go above and beyond from my room to numerous details that make my trip more relaxing. Regardless of how busy they are, they are always kind, and run to bring my car right away. Centrally located. Easy access to head out in any direction.
Very highly reommend.<//review>

We didn't stay here (stayed at The Chamberlain in West Hollywood) but went here simply to go to the Polo Lounge and say we'd been... I was expecting it to be stuffy and the staff to look down on anyone who wasn't a guest, but, I'm pleased to say, I couldn't have been more wrong
The staff were all attentive and friendly
The prices were reasonable and we had a great time ... loved it... will def visit again when we're in town in October< /Text>

Owner couple is typically super Brasilian nice. Their restaurant next door is awesome too. Each room has a little patio set outside where you can hang out sipping a drink. Although I've never been to Brasil, it felt like I was there.<//Review>< pictures>

Front desk Staff is EXTREMELY rude. I called one month in advance to book a garden room with a view for myself and my fiancée and they showed us to a basement room facing Sunset Blvd and simply said “that’s all we have tonight”. No apology was made for not honoring our booking. The room was over $1000/night and very load AND dirty. We opened the mini-bar and a water bottle inside was open and half drunk! Disgusting. I called the fro t desk and the concierge laughed and said he would send someone up to change the bottle but nobody ever came. Dinner was expensive and disappointing. The soup was stone cold when it arrived. Do not stay in this hotel for a special occasion. There are so many other choices and you can do so much better than the horrible Beverly Hills Hotel.< /review>

<text>I had a wonderful stay here with my sister and best friend. I think if you are visiting L.A it is just an experience that you should try, even if for just 1 night. We spent the day mostly at the pool, pleasantly surprised that it was not crowded at all, there was so much space. We went for a swim during the evening as well and enjoyed the under water music whole floating in the pool looking into the starts and palm trees. Unforgettable moment. We had drinks as well in the Polo Lounge, really enjoyed that part as well! Everyone is very attentive and proud to be part of this hotel. I definitely will try and come back again!<//text>< pictures>

The Beverly Hills Hotel is Iconic, you have to go and have a drink in the Polo Lounge or the other club upstairs which I prefer. If you Valet Park and get a drink valet parking is taken care of. There's just something about this place that's pretty great to go and have a drink, even dinner.</Text>

The café is substantially smaller than I expected for a major hotel, although there's a wee patio area outside that, like the inside, has television screens - something people can no longer do without, apparently. Nobody is able to just sit and drink tea and be contented any more. Distraction is everything.<//text>

< Review>
I love Hotel Bel-Air
I stayed here this past weekend and I really did feel like I was in Brazil!
The decor of the motel both the inside and out is beautiful.
I felt like I was staying at a Brazilians house, eating brazilian food, listening to brazilian music, while I talked to some brazilians I met on my stay. Sounds like I pretty much went to Brazil right!

The owners are extremly nice and welcoming.
There is also a Brazilian restaruant right next door.
You can call in and get your food delivered to your room!
And to top everything off staying at Villa Brasil is very affordable!
I love this place.
I highly recomend staying here, you're seriously in for an adventure!<//Review>

Simply gorgeous and breathtaking.

No wonder why this is the hotel of choice for celebrities, royalty and you and me.
Swim in the same pool as Oscar winners and dine to no end.
This is the ultimate experience that will create memories to last.

Once and a lifetime experience. We stayed here on our trip to L.A. It was pretty amazing. Food is pricey but, that's expected here and seeing I paid a good amount of money for one night, I just sat back and took it all in. Sat in the lobby people watching and it was a pretty cool to imagine all the people who have graced the hallways past and present. Never thought we'd be here. It was a great experience and if its in your budget, definitely worth a stay. People were fantastic, reception at the front desk was top notch. Aside from expensive food, this place was one of the best places I have ever stayed at!  9.5!!< /text>

The Polo Lounge restauraunt has always been the epitome of class and elegance.  Make sure to try their Negroni or their chocolate soufflé if you are craving something decadent!</review>

Gorgeous California hideaway, nestled in Bel Air’s Stone Canyon; go for a perfect brunch or a romantic getaway in their fireplace/patio bungalows.  Top service to match the top pricing but unique to any other hotel in LA. Jazz in the bar is also a highlight.< /Text>

This hotel is iconic, so it's already got that going for it. Really nice hotel; I used to make delieries here, but never stayed. The location is very easy to get to as it located smack dab in the middle of some major Beverly Hills cross-streets. This hotel is not going to come cheap, but it's nice, so if price isn't important to you, then you should definitely check it out.< /Text>

<text>Stayed here at the beginning of July for 2 nights, and not impressed. Hotel has no ambience, it is like a ghost town. Staff was friendly but upon arrival I was in shock that such a well known establishment has no music or any type of character. Yes, it is a famous hotel and that is the only thing they can milk out of it. The lobby smells like a funeral home and has no wow factor for the price. It really smells like an old grandmas house. With what they charge they can afford a nice sound system with great aromatherapy. The only thing I actually liked was the Fountain Cafe. Best tuna melt!</text><response>None< /response><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1564929853822< /Time>< Rating>

This is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at. Once my husband and I stayed at Bel-Air we never stayed at another hotel in LA. The property is absolutely stunning, a secret and tranquil garden. The service is impeccable and they’ve thought of every detail. We always brings our dogs and they welcome them with open arms. Our dogs are our family so this means the world to us. In addition to our pups, every single detail is on point and every request is fulfilled.<//text>

This hotel is as unique as it's reputation. A wonderful experience. The 1912 bar is great. It doesn't have the Polo Lounge's notoriety but it has a great atmosphere. What can you say about the pool? There is nothing more to say - it is an icon.< /Review>

Rich in history and it is often the choice of legends who sometimes even call this, The Pink Palace, their home.

<text>I had 6 big bags with me at check in. The hotel stuff saw the struggle, did not offer any sort of help. For a 5 star hotel This is not acceptable. Room was smelling funny, worn out blankets.very little amenities. Dirty coffee table. Beds were comfy. But everything else was a terrible mess. I had a lot of expectation and to make things worse after I had my buffet breakfast which comprised of 7 items in total. The waitress came in with a bill to my surprise.  18 dollar for morning breakfast. Never doing this again! Horrible experience< /text>< pics>

Really, should i even do this review... It's the four seasons! I'm gonna say, very consistent with what I expected. From ordering a microwave for my room too lounging in my big plushy robe, it was all i expected it to be.

Definitely on the list for the come back tour :-)</text>

It was all worth it stay here in The Beverly Hills Hotel. From ambiance, hotel itself was so nice and clean. My hotel room was well arranged and cozy has a nice overlooking. That was an excellent service  experience.<//review>

<Review>Superb! A wonderful experience; from the entryway to the Polo Lounge, great service that is reminiscent of the way things should be done. Thank you Beverly Hills Hotel for a great evening with my great artist friend.</Review>< GmapID>

<Text>13 plus acres of privacy and loveliness. Wolfgang Pucks restaurant on property is elegantly simple and extraordinary at the same time. Sea Bass is delectable. Though the hotel and her mysteries are intriguing it is the well trained, courteous and delightful staff who bring us back.< /Text>< Date>

The bar at the Bel-Air Hotel used to have that same dated air. Later, someone came along and ripped it out during a renovation, replacing the classic Hollywood charm with something gray and soulless, presumably to appeal to the kind of trust-fund kids who have money to burn but no taste. I've never been back since.<//review>

One of my favourite places in LA - all year long. It's a World class hotel, always a great place to stay or visit! It's charming, iconic, timeless and elegant. Elite crowd. The staff is always professional, detail oriented and kind, service is great. Location is good, beautiful areas, gardens, pool and nice restaurants.</review>

<text>The Hotel Bel-Air is an incredibly luxurious and wonderful Resort. The grounds and environment are Immaculate, with beautiful plants, flowers, and Lawn areas. There is a natural Creek, with trickling water, swans, and ducks. All these lend to a tranquil and beautiful atmosphere. My room was wonderful, luxurious, and very comfortable. The staff are attentive and very friendly, and  they treat everyone like royalty. A stay at the hotel Bel-Air is an experience not to be missed.< /text>< pics>

The rooms are beautiful and the grounds are unbelievably wonderful. Just like a big garden. The Hotel Bel-Air is a private retreat away from the noise of Los Angeles, but close to the shops and restaurants of Beverly Hills.  I️t is an excellent hotel.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Staff is very friendly and the rooms are nice. I went to the coffee shop for a quick pick me up and got a single shot of espresso. It was 10 dollars for the single shot of espresso. I get it, they gotta make money. But when I pay so much for a stay making every amenity that expensive is ridiculous. Have some complementary coffee or something 10 dollars for a single espresso is absolute lunacy.< /text>

Gorgeous old Hollywood romance with beauty and style. Swans in the water. Marylin Munroe's swimming pool (now sadly missing it diving board. Lots of attentive staff there when you want/need them invisible when not you don't. Food is elegant and light (best by the pool). Expensive as hell of course!< /Text>

The Hotel was very nice, well appointed, newly rennovated/new, and I enjoyed staying there. The staff was good, breakfast each day was good (hot and inc. in price of room) and my room was large with a new flat screen TV. The colors and decor throughout the hotel was really pleasant, bright/nice colors and contemporary style.<//text>

The cafe is a fun and yummy local spot with a cool dinner vibe. A latte is $11, a 2 item omelette is approximately $28, validated valet $10...costly but good!< /text>

Nice quiet location. One of La's oldest and most famous hotels but it is a little dated and could use a refresh. But all in all still a classy place to stay. Grounds are  well kept and friendly valet staff makes you feel welcome from the moment they open your door.</text>

<Review>Nothing short of excellent.  The view from my balcony room on my most recent stay was absolutely breathtaking, as are the beautiful gardens throughout the property.  Swim in the pool, it’s heated and there is music that plays UNDER THE WATER!!!!  (I know, right?!?!?!?!) ….but best of all, the staff is so very attentive, it’s truly remarkable.  Trust me, you won’t be disappointed.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Hotel was nice. Very comfortable bed, nice bathrooms. Hotel food was delicious. Quietest hotel I've ever experienced... even the toilets are ultra quiet. I think prices are a bit high for what you get, but maybe it's just California prices.< /review>

Love and need to go back! I just returned from an incredible weekend at this gorgeous hotel. I have stayed in some big names in the past that were a disappointment. Luckily my friend suggested this place and it was perfect! I am returning in the fall and will be booking here once again! Great staff great service great location just perfect!<//text>

I am not sure if it is just because you expect the Hotel Bel-Air to be amazing and so it is, but, this was an amazing place to visit. It was a very cold night and the staff apologized and insisted I come back when it is warmer. The cold did not get in the way of the experience. As you enter and then cross the bridge it feels a little "Secret Garden" like. If I had a home in that canyon I would want it surrounded with the same beautiful foliage they have worked into the property. The staff is very professional and quick to help with anything I needed for the night. We hosted a group for a cocktail event and their food, wine and environment was perfect for mixing and mingling. It was cold outside where the couches were and though they had heat lamps it would have been good to have an indoor sitting option.
The renovated rooms are fabulous. High ceilings, beautiful furniture, good layout.
Our after hours were spent in the bar enjoying a subtle piano player and fireplace. It feels like a classic part of LA history.<//Review>

This is the most amazing place to stay if you want a moment to escape LA and life and relax in style.  The bar with live piano and brilliant photography is to die for as are the veggie chips.  The rooms are spacious and sophisticated with everything you could dream of an more.  This is one of the nicest hotels in the World.  Ive traveled almost everywhere and have stayed at the best and this is in my top 3.  Bucket list hotel for those who really appreciate good service and staff, hotel quality and amenities.< /review>

Food is good, but not the best I have had.  Still, you are paying for the ambience and the service, and both are pretty unbeatable.

A fantastic special occasion place.  Sit outdoors if you can as the weather here is usually amazing all year round.  It is amazing for brunch and for dinner.

Inside tip:  Their fried chicken is served only Sunday nights, and it is amazing.</text>

This pink palace, otherwise known as The Beverly Hills Hotel, has long been a favorite among Hollywood stars both old and new. In 1956, Gregory Peck and Lauren Bacall filmed Designing Woman by its pool. The Polo Lounge was a favorite drinking haunt for Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and the rest of their Rat Pack. Today, it remains one of the top places in town to see and be seen.

Insider Tip: Don’t miss the hotel’s Fountain Coffee Room, which has a curved soda fountain counter and iconic banana leaf wallpaper<//review>

My name is George Anton. Hollywood film director. I love it here. The Beverly Hills Hotel. For over a century, The Beverly Hills Hotel has been the spot for Hollywood's brightest lights, the ultimate beacon of glamour. She greets you like a movie star from the moment you pass the iconic signage, step onto the signature red carpet and enter the grand lobby. Welcome to the legacy. The Beverly Hills Hotel<//review>

Terrific for a relaxing getaway, yet close enough to nightlife, shopping, great dining, and tourist attractions if you are looking for those activities.  Historic hotel, newly renovated and nestled in a canyon residential area of Beverly Hills.  Great staff who makes you feel welcome, on site gym and pool, beautiful spa, and the rooms come with the latest technology and beautiful decor.  Family and pet friendly, plus the food of Wolfgang Puck.  The lounge has a cool celebrity vibe.  Don't miss the Tina Turner wall or the swans in the "lake".< /review>

This Place is a double five star meaning it’s a five-star restaurant in a five-star hotel. Want to experience amazing service in amazing food and go to the Beverly Hills Hotel everybody there is top notch. There are people that if were there for 40+ years now that’s a good sign!<//Review>

<review>Loved their spa. It's very private and relaxing, and feels luxurious. The massage was very good. The whole setting there feels like you are somewhere far away from the bustle of Los Angeles. I parked at the property with valet (cost around $10-$12) but I believe there is street parking before you hit the hotel if you don't want to pay. I would go back in a heartbeat.< /review>< resp>

We stayed at the Bel Air Hotel last June during our holidays in California and although it was booking at the last minute, we managed to get a fantastic price for the room. Firstly, the location is just perfect, hidden in the Bel Air area, it's really a cozy oasis in the bustling La, the neighborhood makes it even quieter, with all the green and palm trees. Attention to detail is simple everywhere. Very friendly and helpful staff, always ready to help you in any way possible, they can.<//text>

The great iconic hotel. So sad that it is owned by an evil tyrant who promotes KILLING gay and lesbian people by stoning them to death in his own country. Boycott this place until it has a new owner.<//text>

One of my favorite neighborhood spots in LA.  I am NEVER not in the mood for Hotel Bel-Air.  It's almost absurdly pleasant.  Lunch, dinner, afternoon or evening cocktails, whatever.  It's tranquil but always fun. Food and drinks are wonderful, and every member of the staff is courteous and thoughtful.  Beautiful indoor and outdoor seating, the grounds are lovely.  It's a perfect place to go for a little respite from the bustle of the city.<//Text>

<Text>The location of the hotel is great because it's so accessible while being completely private. You'd never know just how spread out it is from looking at it. The rooms are amazing. Presidential Bungalow is worth every penny. Service is second to none. Special accommodations are their specialty. They add personal touches for every guest.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My favorite hotel in the world. A luxurious step back in time. Beautiful and private, incredible food and service. Love the bar (as do celebrities). The valet gave us a ride to a restaurant! Romantic and all around perfect.</Text>

For the most part this Hotel is great. Sometimes very noisy when crowded with kids banging doors closed. Parking lot can get tight. Very good location and clean. The staff is very friendly and the free breakfast is decent and filling. Very easy access to highways, restaurants and shopping.< /text>

<Text>I would recommend this place to anyone who likes luxury travel, or is looking to splurge on a ro***tic getaway. The amenities in the room are pretty standard. The service is excellent. We always had transport willingly available to us from the resort. Offer nice price packages over weekends some times.< /Text>< pics>

I picked up some folks going to airport. Very nice establishment. The only thing that pops into my head is, why can't I live like this? Why do (I) have to live in my car in a warehouse parking lot like an animal? This is the lifestyle I am meant to live. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong! 😉<//Text>

Love this hidden hotel amongst the hustle and bustle of the city.  Trees make the hotel beautiful and as if you arent anywhere near a city.  Staff was attentive and awesome, every whim taken care of with no issues.  Highly recommend staying here if you need to get away but dont want to travel too far.</text>

A very relaxing and elegant hotel to stay. The service at the Polo Lounge is professional and attentive, the lobby is spacious and comforting, and you will definitely feel the elegance of Beverly Hills in almost every detail of the hotel. The only comment I have to say is that for our extensive stay, we would've loved if the hotel had done some extra  five star touches to make the stay even more memorable. That would even make us come back sooner; overall, though, the hotel is amazing!< /review>

<review>I always have love the ambience of this little hotel ,it has a very retro feel to it but still high-end and classy as you would expect.
The servers in the restaurant are always kind and courteous and very knowledgeable about both the food and the wines.
The rooms however crack me up sometimes I can't figure out if they ever left their grandmothers house and just bought nice things to go in it.
The suites are very spacious with all the amenities and has a very homey touch to it.
And the beds are so comfortable the pillows are comfortable and they have a big comfortable comforter. I could sleep for days and days in that bed</review>< Pics>

<Text>Went for a drink at the pool bar, other than checking this off of places to see/things to do in LA, there's not a whole here. What you would expect from a famous Beverly Hills landmark. Service was good at the pool bar, food was alright. If you're there at the right time, you'll see some people you see on TV.<//Text>< pictures>

The service is top notch, the food & drink are the best (for birthdays/anniversaries, order a gorgeous handmade cake ahead of time) and if you see celebrities, just let them be.

Oh my god I've attended the event there The Pink Pump Affair. This hotel is so beautiful and totally over-the-top. The event I attended there was beyond anything that I could say. The food service that they gave during the event was a phenomenal. I made a donation to the fundraiser and I won a gifts. Who don't live gifts and surprises. I had to take pictures of the bathrooms because they were so organized they were so beautiful so outstanding late out walking through the lobby I was overwhelmed and and I felt like I was a star in the thirties the forties the 50s to 60s to 70s. Just can say I love this pink Hotel< /review>

<review>First off, you can't beat the classic nature of the Beverly Hills Hotel. From the plan tree wallpaper to the photos on the wall of the Polo Lounge - where I just happened to brunch right after I proposed to my wife. Visit, spend the night, but whatever you do, get a chocolate malt in the coffee shop downstairs. It's pricey but 200000% worth it. One of my most favorite hotels in the whole world.< /review>< Date>

<Review>First time here. The decor is an acquired look. Obviously, customer service would be over the top because of their reputation. Room service staff very professional. If I had a choice, I would choose a"hippier" place to stay in L.A.</Review><date>1514374967963< /date></record></dataset><record>

<review>I stayed here with my two dogs and anybody that travels with dogs knows how important it is that their dogs (or dog) are accommodated for and absolutely appreciate it when they are treated with respect as if they were people. Hotel Bel Air made every effort to make me feel comfortable and my dogs feel comfortable with very plush dog beds and individual dog bowls and water bowls and freshly packaged dog biscuits already in the room before we got there. The hotel however does not offer a specific dog food menu but will literally make exactly what you want and how you want it when ordering room service. The grounds of the hotel are absolutely gorgeous and have plenty of pathways and grass areas which is also a major plus for walking the pups.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Always love staying here. The service is always above and beyond my expectations. The rooms are recently renovated, so although the hotel is old and historic, it feels brand new! Location is the best for Beverly hills as it is more private and serene, nestled in the middle of a residential area. Can't say enough good things about this place!</Text>

Service is fast. Staff are courteous. Rooms are clean, relaxing and well kept. Location is fine but it will be more awesome if its walking distance to shopping areas, supermarket and pharmacy.< /Text>

<text>The valet staff outside is highly unprofessional to say the least.
It's ok to be courteous to a ride-share driver,even if you're not making tips off of them .
Just because you're in a "special"mood doesn't give you the right to be condescending,disrespectful and prejudice.
On a lighter note, if your employer is a muslim,I think you've lost the "right" to act/be a racist bigot.

I wish HR is more selective hiring the first faces customers see when they first get to the establishment.<//text>< pics>

<Time>1492407666224<//Time><rate>1</rate><review>Drinks in the bar at 7pm which was so dark and underwhelming, I couldn't read the menu. Service adequate but not good, no water  was offered. TV was on at the bar which is crass.  Paid my bill with cash and whilst waiting for valet parking ($12 a complete rip off) bar man came charging up saying we hadnt left enough money. I tersely told him I'd left $40 dollars in cash which the female bar woman had taken. The dollars left with the bill were the tip. We were furious, he was apologetic which was too late, he should have checked before making an accusation. Worst experience ever in 5 star hotel. Over rated, appalling service don't waste time or money visiting.< /review>< pics>

Overall, I loved this hotel--sparkling accommodations, lush gardens, lovely pool.  Staff courteous and helpful.  It is out-of-the-way, in a private, intimate setting.  Which is great, except that you are dependent on the hotel for meals, coffee, snacks, in short--everything--because it is located in a residential area that is miles from the city.  The cost of these extras exceeded the cost of the room (there is a daily charge for wifi--who charges for that anymore?).  Restaurant prices are exorbitant--which I wouldnt have minded if the food were good, but it was MEDIOCRE at best…and you cannot walk down the street to other restaurants.  No coffee-maker in the room (you have to buy theirs); no iron in the room (you have to pay for pressing); you get the idea.  Bring lots of cash, because everyone has their hand out.  My husband characterized it as the greediest hotel hes ever encountered.  That said, I still enjoyed it!  Next time, Id probably have food delivered.</review>

Loved this place! Would've sat outside if temperature was about 10 degrees warmer. Brunch was delicious! I rated food 4 starts because my friend ordered yogurt and it came in a very small stemless martini glass, and honestly, Paying what we did for it I feel like you should've received more. One more thing, mimosas were $12. I don't mind paying for nice things but $12? Overall, I recommend this place and would definitely come back and tell my friends!<//text>

We had brunch at the poolside cafe. Great ambiance, friendly staff. Food was decent and didn't really stand out or satisfy, especially at the prices, but you're paying for the atmosphere and the experience. Not sure I would go back for a meal on a random day, but on the short list of places to go for occasions or if we have guests from out of town.<//text>

<text>We can only echo previous reviews in that the gardens make this such a lovely place to stay. The surprising part was how conveniently located it is to everything. The rooms are nicely sized.

<review>I spent three nights at the hotel in early December for a business conference nearby and had a terrific experience. The staff is friendly and accommodating without being overly solicitous, rooms are spacious and comfortable (and quiet!) and facilities are ample. Was especially impressed with the food - from the minibar selections (from Dean & Deluca) to the delicious restaurant...</review>< response>

< Review>
They destroyed this once elegant and beautiful establishment.  I patronized the dining room on many occasions and, in fact, was there to partake of the last meal before they closed for a protracted renovation.  A few weeks after reopening, I went to see what was done.  I recognized almost nothing.  It's a disaster.  Having lunch, I realized I was being subjected to Queen's Freddie Mercury singing "Everyone Bites the Dust."  I love the song and Queen but during lunch at the Bel-Air?  I think not.  I have not returned and many others have done the same.  What a tragedy !</Review>

The difference is really in the bathroom, which is a highlight in the Loft Room or the balcony/Jacuzzi which is the best feature to the Canyon Suite. The hotel is nestled in the beautiful Bel Air neighborhood and you will thoroughly enjoy a daily walk in this peaceful enclave. The overall atmosphere is classy and comfortable as a getaway.</Text>

It's The Beverly Hills Hotel, that's why I love it! What's not to like! The rooms are huge, the lobby is beautiful, the hospitality staff is so nice and accommodating!

<Text>I love this place!  When we checked they upgraded us for free to a mini suite which is a corner room!  The view is spectacular!  We have stayed here before and love it every time.  The staff is very attentive and happy.  The rooms at spacious.  It is close to ATT park so if going to the game or an event  you can walk from the hotel!  You won't be disappointed if you stay here.<//Text>< Pics>

second stay at this gorgeous resort, everything seems to be perfect except this is second time in a row that room was not ready for check in when we arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm, otherwise entire stay was perfect. The manager did comp drinks and appetizer at the bar for the delay.</Text>

Excellent location with great rooms that are very spacious. But what makes this hotel in credible is the history and also the service currently provided by the staff<//text>

<review>Everyone had thoughtful suggestions for things to do during our stay in LA, and were prompt in attending to our needs. The setting of the hotel is so refreshing after a long day of shopping or simply fighting the LA traffic. It's the old lack of training and visible ***agement.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I recently stayed three nights and my experience was simply incredible!  I didn't want to leave and I can't wait to stay there again.  The staff is so professional, friendly, courteous, and really make you feel welcome and right at home.  Also, the service and food at all of the on-site dining/drinking options (Polo Lounge, Fountain Coffee Room, Cabana Cafe, and Bar Nineteen12) is second to none.  Stay here, you will not be disappointed. I don't generally write reviews but felt compelled to do so because my experience was just so remarkably good.  Thanks B.H.H.!!! I'LL BE BACK SOON!<//text>

<Review>We really enjoyed our dinner here when we stayed at the Hotel Bel-Air.  I had the fish and chips and it was delicious.  The fish was excellent and the chips were nice and thick.  My boyfriend had a steak that was also very good.

Had an amazing birthday dinner with my wife. I have lived in La for 20 years had never been here before except for a wedding. When I came there for that I knew I had to bring her here for this. She loved it home run.</Review>

Nothing can be said that hasn't already been said about five-star accommodations and service and food.
Unfortunately this gorgeous Mecca is owned by an a****** bigot. Not to be overlooked, but the staff and their tips should not suffer because of this fact which the wonderful staff has no control over...... so I enjoy but I still say the owner is an a****** bigot every chance I get. I also tip the stuff extra for having to put up with the stigma.< /review>

<Text>Due to the unprofessional room reservation system, as I experienced on 3/6; I had my room revservation confirmation# already but once I brought all my luddages to the lobby. One guy incharged in "Directior of assisstant room service position" appearedat the lobby, show me a picece of paper  and have me sign up  in order to reject my reservation.
"WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION IN ADVANCE before the customer arrive; for this reason Hotel Bel-Air SHOULD NOT reach any 5-star WORLDWIDE standard at all. I even don't want to give them any star. This is such kind of trash made whole Bel Air area become like LAUSY community. This hotel did not fit with  Bel Air community expectation at all.

Never been to the Beverly Hills Hotel, it looks really beautiful but I have a few questions.
Do any of the rooms have mirrors on the ceiling? Can you get pink champagne on ice there? And although you can check out anytime you like, can you ever leave?< /Text>

Gorgeous, iconic, and an important piece of California history. The Beverly Hills area actually gets its name from this hotel. Anybody who can make the time should at least stop by.< /Review>

A pleasant and comfortable hotel, excellent location, the hotel is built in a typical Los Angeles residential building, residential apartments with a pool and Jacuzzi in the center, quite expensive parking services, a nice little restaurant that provides a meal and coffee. The place is pleasant, the service is excellent.<//review>

Disappointed for the first time, the carpets were stained badly, couple pieces of trash in parking lot, had to ask for water 3 times, felt like I was a bother, just wasn't anything like what I have experienced in the past. The attention to detail seemed to be declining..</Text>

<Text>I have dined here previously and throughly enjoyed it but recently went to the Cabana Cafe for a birthday brunch I coordinated for a friend and was very dissapointed in the service. For a restaurant that charges a high premium you should expect the same attention to service. We ordered 4 dishes , 2 of which were French toast that came out COLD. They took ours away while our friends then had to eat their meals. It just wasnt a great experience especially for someone's birthday. After all that it took a while to get 2 new French toasts (our friends had basically finished eating). The service this time was slow and poor enough for all of us to not return in the future.</Text>< Response>

As good as it gets. So many great places to eat on the 11 acre spread in the heart of Beverly Hills. The staff and service are an example to all, from the valets to the front of house to the service staff at the restaurants. If money is no object, but your standards are best-in-class, then count on this place.</text>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Food: One home-run (large portion of Puck’s signature Wiener schnitzel) and one C+ short ribs nightly special (too fatty and a tiny portion), and an excellent chocolate souffle.  Atmosphere: not quite as elegant as the old restaurant but still beautiful and, for the most part, quiet enough to have a conversation (a rarity in L.A. these days), but the noise increased (though not too intrusive) when they piped in (bizarrely) some country music, and it was about to get much noisier at the time we were about to leave, there being a large wedding taking place seemingly throughout the hotel, with multiple music venues.  Something worth checking out when you make a reservation.  As to all the reviewers who complained about “exorbitant” prices: give me a break!  Wolfgang Puck plus Hotel Bel-Air does not equal MacDonald’s prices.</text>< pictures>

We went to go have lunch at the Polo Lounge and the service was amazing and on point and the drinks were really good. The food was meh, we ordered mains and an appetizer and the meat tasted very charbroiled, a little bit of a flavoring is good, but it was an overpowering. Overall the food the drinks and service and ambiance were all wonderful but the food was not worth the price.< /Text>

Still the most refined oasis in any major city but Wolfgang needs to spend more time at his restaurant. Ate twice at the restaurant, dinner was very mediocre. Not up to par for a Puck restaurant and service slow..< /review>

The food was very good, but I will say that it felt a little overpriced, but I suppose that's ok given it's really cool history. The Fountain room in the basement is my favorite, it's a mandatory stop for me every time I'm in town, and you have to try the apple pie!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2bcf12bd777e1:0x8f0e72ca4c31466d</GmapID></record>

We held a birthday brunch for 10 people here on Sunday, granted it was a perfect LA day which added to the atmosphere, but it was just a very special place, with excellent food, great service, and terrific ambience. We were there for 3 hours! no body wanted to leave, I suppose the flowing champagne helped ! great exeperience and not as expensive as you would think.</Text>

<Text>I came for an event which was hosted in the rodeo drive hall of the hotel.
I parked on the street to avoid valet fees.
Inside doesn't seem as fancy as I expected.
I possibly would add an extra star if I stayed in one of the rooms for the night and rated it, but hey maybe another time.<//Text><Rate>4<//Rate>< username>

< review>
After learning my brother was in a serious car accident in Saint Louis Obispo my wife and I decided to drive down to LA and check us into the Beverly Hills hotel. We wanted to take my mother's mind off my brothers accident. Explaining the story to the Hotel staff they checked us into one of the bungalows. Keep in mind I did not find the price for a room any higher then a quality hotel room. I work for hotels and this hotel had to top any hotel I've ever stayed at. The staff, the service, the decor. Everything about this property: is 5 stars. One example the hotel staff did for us was one night we were going out for dinner, the concierge provided a limousine free of charge. Another experience was in the Polo Lounge. One of the patrons claiming to be a producer was annoying by trying to cast my wife in a film. The manager of the Polo Lounge would not let us pay for any of our cocktails. Working for the hotel industry for over 20 years this is unheard of. I would like to thank the staff for five star hospitality.<//review>

This is a five star hotel! What a wonderful staff! We got a deal on their website and even got an upgrade when we arrived. This is a place everyone should stay at least once in a life time. If the walls could talk, what wonderful history of the who's who. We look forward to our return again. Hope to get the same room with the secret exit. :) Thanks to a wonderful staff!

Great location, beautiful hotel but the food is ridiculously overpriced compared to its quality. Portions are too small and not tasty at all. It is not worth it especially when you consider all these great restaurants in the area.<//Review>

<Review>We stayed at the Hotel Bel-Air for several days during New Year's and did not have one complaint! The hotel is in an excellent location. They offer free wi-fi and a free wine hour from 5-6 pm and the staff is excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. We will definitely be staying here on our next visit to CA .< /Review>< pics>

This place isn't any great place.

Hubby and and I came on a Friday night for DineLa. We were early and seated very quickly. There are booths and in the center are tables. Ambience is romantic with dim lights. It could get cold since seating is sort of an outdoor area patio but it's kind of covered with heat lamps. Hubby had to grab a coat.

Food was good but not great. Maybe it was the set menu for DineLa so I'll have to come back to try the other regular dishes.

Parking isn't great. There's street parking across the street if you come early enough but other wise there's valet with the hotel.</text>

I was picking up someone at hotel. The valet wanted me to go to a middle lane. My guests were in front by the first lane pulling up to the hotel. He dashed to my side of the car started pounding his hand repeatedly on my car like a crazy person. Screaming at me and continued to pound on my car. I was startled taken aback and could not believe any 1 star hotel let alone a so called 5 star hotel would allow a valet to behave like this. I was scared and shaken and basically assaulted by a valet. I called the hotel to review the tape. The manager called me back and tried to defend his behavior as a tap. I drive a Mercedes and this was not a tap. I was disgusted by her defending him. I would never stay at this hotel. It is disgusting and a disgrace to Beverly Hills. T<//Text>

Since I was a young fellow in the 80s, I've always had a great experience there, whether as a guest, attending a lunch or directing a video. It's a place of history and mystery.< /review>

Came here over the weekend to catch the NBA finals. Had a few drinks and appetizers at their bar. Food and drinks were delicious! Staff and bartenders here were very friendly, however there was a waitress who kept on conversating with a fellow colleague. The room was quiet enough and all you heard was her conversation about Coachella and whatnot. Somewhat unprofessional at such a high-end establishment. Remember to see the seans before you leave!< /text>

The staff is fantastic! Not in a disingenuous (stuffy) way. Maybe the last place you'd expect that to be the case, but even with being taken aback at how immaculate location is, the "realness" of the staff completely outshined. Six out of five!<//Text>

< Review>
I was going to be married there, in June 2010, but due to an unexpected (ahem) pregnancy, we were unable to. We called to cancel 9 months in advance, giving them ample time to update their timetable.

The hotel decided they ought to keep hold of our $1500 deposit, and didn't offer to exchange it for a short stay there or anything.

You owe us, Hotel Bel-Air.<//Review>

< Review>
Unique hotel and dining location tucked away in the hills of Bel-Air. Finest, superbly prepared cuisine, operated by Wolfgang Puck for Dorchester properties. Great table service. Could be a good spot for star gazing, as the secluded location and very pricey menus attract members of the "hoity-toity". Bring lots of cash.< /Review>

You should be ashamed. Svend Petersen worked for you for over 40 years and you can't even help the guy. He's 86 years old & had to sleep under a bridge.

My wife and I stayed four nights at the hotel couple weeks ago. We were celebrating her birthday and our anniversary. Prior to our arrival we were very excited for staying at the BHH- iconic, legendary etc. Upon arrival we requested if possible to have a room with a nice view. The front desk person assure us in a very condescending voice, the room we will be staying in is very nice and with a view, an upgrade from what our reservation was for. To our surprise, it was everything but! The room not only was very small, noisy being on the second floor, the worst was the tiny balcony with view of the wall and the dumpster. What a disaster! I did go back to the front desk, and a different person took care of the issues. Unfortunately it's a little too late, the excitement was gone. We stay at luxury hotels, for the experience, the nice accommodations, bathrooms and toiletries (which the BHH has the most generic products), the attention to details. Alas, BHH is more about being stuffy, outdated, confused staff and more like a three stars hotel than a luxury five stars one. The good news is, we have a lot better options for our future visits to Beverly Hills and the surroundings.<//text>

<review>Years ago, the food at the Polo Lounge was amazing, but from 2012-2016, I have found the taste, presentation & overall quality of the food & the beverages very subpar, and mainly seems the consistency is completely lacking. Not worth the $1500 bill at the end of the Father's Day meal my family had.< /review>< Rate>

The best place to stay  in la by far!! For business or pleasure they do it just right we told them it was our honeymoon they put pink rose peddals on our bed by turndown service in the shape of a heart! everybody knows you by name even the cleaning crew! And the thing i was most impressed with was that all the staff step to the side when your coming down the path! They dont miss a beat from the decor to the spa! Bottom line if your looking for SERVICE this is the place!!</review>

Great chill atmosphere at the bar, service great and linguine dish was yummy.  Bartender went out of his way to hunt me down pickle juice to add to my Kettle One martini !

<rating>4< /rating><review>We stayed in a bungalow. Unfortunately when we got to the room the bathtub wasn't really clean. Plus the room really needs to be redecorated. It was dark and the walls were dark and had a single window which was obscured by bushes outside. It was small and very pricey. Not what I expected from a hotel of this class.<//review>< pictures>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>This review is strictly for the Polo Club restaurant. We finally went here from brunch yesterday after my girlfriend had been pleading for us to try it for months.

Needless to say, after going here once, we won't be back. Don't get me wrong, the grounds were lovely and the service was fine. It's just that the food quality was literally that of a Howard Johnson complimentary continental at a price point befitting its Beverly Hills address.

I got a chorizo omlette with hash browns. It honestly looked and tasted like it came out of a frozen package from Trader Joes. It was caloric sustenance, no more and no less. My gf got the french toast, which was slightly better, but again, a rather large letdown. For $24 a plate and $7 coffee (not to mention $9 valet service), we expected a great breakfast. Instead, we left feeling taken advantage of.

Go elsewhere. Almost anywhere is a better value.</Review>< Pictures>

Really disappointing as it has such an established brand. We didn't even get any glass cups for our drinks - two of which were prosecco! The food was also under expectation. We went to the cabana cafe</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>The best hotel in Los Angeles, probably North America, and quite possibly the entire world. A marvel to any luxury traveler with an eye for detail. They didn't miss anything. Sometimes when I'm here, I play a little game with myself where I try to find fault with some aspect of the the hotel and I can't do it. It's on the pricey side (but no more than any other luxury brand) and it's totally worth every penny. If you're looking for tranquility in the big city, world class service in the most luxurious and peaceful setting imaginable, then you've come to the right place.

I'd recommend this place as the perfect venue for an incredible date, to pop the question, to have the wedding at, or to go on your honeymoon at. I think you get my drift- it's one of the most elegant and romantic spots in the world. Everything here is world class.

The food is incredible. Honestly, they do room service so well here, that I often prefer to dine in than go out to some of my favorite restaurant in LA. It's kind of a funny thing, but the Hotel Bel Air may be home to the best Huevos Rancheros in the world (honorable mention for the steak frittes.) They also have an amazing bar area with one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had.

The rooms are really the masterpieces of the structural part of the hotel though. From almost any point in the room you can control the temperature, the lights (there are such convenient settings for them too,) or order any of the services the hotel has to offer. The miss no details, right down to the heated bathroom floors in winter. I'd invite anyone who's reconsidering a remodel of their home to come stay here for a couple of nights to take notes on features you might not have thought of, but will instantly recognize as perfection.

And the real masterpiece is the service. My only warning is that once you've been treated this well, you may not feel like anywhere else really lives up. For an incredibly busy person, this is the place for you. I have them unpack and pack my bags upon arrival and departure (they do about ten times a better job than I could and in a fraction of the time.) The concierge desk here rivals that of any in the world. Just tell them what you're interested in, and they'll supply you with an insiders itinerary for whatever it is you fancy. I saw them handling the medical needs of a guest so well yesterday that I secretly wished that they working in my doctors office when I got back home. They got me into an impossible restaurant within an hour of my asking and I can tell you from experience that doing these kinds of things is the norm out here.

Lastly, I know there's some controversy with the owner of this hotel, but after I thought about boycotting this place it occurred to me that I would most definitely not be doing any real damage to this man on the other side of the world who's worth 20 billion dollars. Instead, I would be hurting the people I've come to value most in this city. I'd imagine the people who are really suffering are the employees of this hotel, who are probably losing their jobs wholesale from this boycott thing. They're genuinely some of the most intelligent, empathetic, knowledgeable, and caring people in this city. So I am still very happy to stay here, because I'm for supporting them. I can understand the other perspective, and it's certainly valid, this is just my two cents.<//Review>< pictures>

This place is the cats' meow, the creme de la creme, the best spot in town to rendez-vous.  I visit my clients at their homes or in hotels and know all of them in Los Angeles and this one is a fairy tale, world class location, decour and service.  It is simply the best.<//review>

Food was good, atmosphere was kinda stuffy and service was slow (which I imagine is intentional for people who want a leisurely meal but we were hoping to leave earlier than we were able to)< /Review>

My company had a conference in Los Angeles (we make fake vomit and dog poo). Normally the Fake Vomit And Dog Poo Conference, FVADPC for short, is held in Pittsburgh in February, but this year due to a mix up with the booking agent, we ended up in the Beverly Hills Hotel. Now most members of FVADPC are of a working class bent. We like beer, pizza, football and whistling at construction workers. We also are, as a group, a bunch of practical jokers as our choice of profession no doubt informs. This seemed to rub the other hotel guests the wrong way, though I could hardly blame them I guess. One morning they are enjoying their 3oz $50 freshly squeezed orange juice, the next they are seated next a large sweaty man in a tattered sports jacket and a shopping bag full of fake dog poo. The staff were not well pleased either. I mean the worst a maid has to deal with on a daily basis is some questionably stained sheets and copious amounts of left over cocaine. The last thing they want to see when they pull off the bedcloths is a vast swath of quivering fake puke. (We used the deluxe version for one maid, the one with the bits of carrot and corn) However, the place was fantastic! The pool had water in it and you would not believe the muffins! Gus from Wisconsin ate 28 organic bran muffins at the first breakfast. He never left his room after that. We enjoyed the conference and the guest speaker, A Leslie Nielson look-a-like. Also we got to tour the famous homes of Beverly Hills and we were allowed into 3 stores on Rodeo Drive. Next year we are back in the Sunnyside motel in downtown Pittsburgh. It won't be quite the same.<//Review>

Yes I miss the Golden Girls decor. The renovation is more Shahs of Sunset than Bel Air. The location is still magic and the food is much better. The Valley girls behind the bar a clueless and will bring you the wrong food order over and over and over again.<//text>

<text>Well where do I start, one particular member of staff kept rolling her eyes at me while talking to me there was no eye contact and she would often go and assist others while dealing with my complaint, this was my third trip to this hotel and I can tell you it will be my last I sent an email and had no reply truly disgusted.</text>< Rate>

<review>(Translated by Google) One of my favorite hotels. Great service. Good with car service that drives and fetches you. The rooms are nice but can differ in size. We have lived in different rooms with and without a balcony. Breakfast by the pool is difficult. Nice to hang out by the pool, have lunch. Well worth going down to the garage if you are interested in cars, there are a number of classics parked.

(Original)
Ett av mina favorithotell. Fantastisk service. Bra med car service som kör och hämtar dig. Rummen är fina men kan skilja sig i storlek. Vi har bott i olika rum med och utan balkong. Frukost vid poolen är svårslaget. Trevligt att hänga vid poolen, äta lunch. Väl värt att åka ner i garaget om man är intresserad av bilar, det finns en rad klassiker parkerade.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-_z1sdC5CQnBwq0YzOei4Gc4jmyKXNa8FnWUz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvorxCA7qe9xTiyEhMDaCWxYIiHC463LyLrhr2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4lPJ-K9uNa_Ux_MHnShY1Q_m3y0KcC2C2lQ-R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFsZVhiGkyN_M9SZWYnm57HTDAK1Mi4HddHLdA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1soytjcx1l1EmEot_CkOViakerUFld04UO237=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWuUW0lWgDAITVdvEKyEGE9gkiKU9Q0Wq6E2cx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSNrR1CJZ1wXdmrGyEcTgvcqqkRxmdKnYeVU9y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMO8em5OsEpV5sYmMehCN9kz7TJXU2r-YvCf_kg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhEXvfF0Pe1JUA-lm9EaRbMqQ8MJuzs7oH5iNQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) The hotel from the outside is very nice, it seems tiny, although I don't know quiet because the roads there are super busy. They have about 4 or 5 valet parking at the door and the surrounding mansions are impressive.

(Original)
El hotel por fuera es muy bonito, parece chiquitito, aunque tranquilidad no se yo porque las carreteras que hay son super transitadas. En la puerta tienen como 4 o 5 aparcacoches y las mansiones que hay por los alrededores son impresionantes.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) During our stay in the United States we spent a few more days at this wonderful hotel, where everything is done to satisfy the guests. Maybe a little expensive, but the game is worth it because in this establishment we feel privileged. The bungalows where nothing is missing are upscale and very luxurious. In the restaurant the dishes are irreproachable and better every day, served by an experienced staff.

(Original)
Lors de notre séjour aux états unis nous avons passé à nouveau quelques jours dans cet hôtel merveilleux, où tout est fait pour satisfaire les clients. Peut-être un peu cher, mais le jeu en vaut la chandelle car dans cet établissement nous nous sentons privilégiés. Les bungalows où rien ne manque sont haut de gamme et très luxueux. Au restaurant les plats sont irréprochables et meilleurs chaque jour, servis par un personnel expérimenté.</text>< time>

(Translated by Google) It is an ancient and historic hotel, the destination of all Hollywood movie stars. Nice atmosphere, good service. I didn't sleep but had lunch, I must say well and with great service, at the pool restaurant. Well attended and pleasant, even if the structure, with its dated architecture, and the "moquettona" everywhere in my opinion needs a breath of renewal.

(Original)
È un albergo antico e storico, meta di tutte le Star del cinema di Hollywood. Bella atmosfera, buon servizio. Non ho dormito ma pranzato, devo dire bene e con un ottimo servizio, al ristorante della piscina. Ben frequentato e piacevole, anche se la struttura, con la sua architettura datata, e la "moquettona" dappertutto necessita a mio avviso di una ventata di rinnovamento.< /Review>

De nouveau une expérience parfaite. Le service est de très haut niveau avec un personnel toujours très attentionné, très efficace et très réactif pour faire de votre séjour un moment unique. L’Hotel Bel-Air est idéalement situé au sein d’un grand espace paysagé avec différents lieux de résidences discrets qui communient avec la nature. Les Chambres et les Suites disposent de tout le confort et de l’équipement moderne d’un hôtel de ce rang. Ambiance magique !<//Review>

<Time>1524873600000<//Time><Review>Expérience remarquable qui se confirme chaque année dans ce lieu exceptionnel situé sur les hauteurs de Bel-Air avec un accueil et un service irréprochable.Idéal pour un court ou plus long séjour en couple ou en famille avec un grand choix de chambres et de suites intégrées avec harmonie aux jardins paysagers magnifiques. Chacune d’entre elles a ses spécificités avec pour certaines un patio privatif voire même  un jacuzzi.Calme et quiétude assurés pour celles et ceux souhaitant s’isoler du monde quand ils le veulent pour mieux profiter en fin de journée ou le soir de l’ambiance du Bar réputé pour ses cocktails ou du restaurant Wolfgang Puck. Mention spéciale pour le personnel très attentionné et le management attentif à ce que l’experience Client soit parfaite.< /Review>< resp>

(Translated by Google) A must-see for LA, a real journey back in time. Staff caring and smiling. The dishes lack a bit of originality for the restaurant by the pool.

Incontournable de LA, un véritable retour dans le temps. Personnel au petit soins et souriant. Les plats manquent un peu d’originalité pour le restaurant en bord de piscine.<//text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) A historic luxury hotel in Los Angeles .. some shops are also in the interior .. obviously not cheap prices for both the rooms and the shops. You can still visit the lobby, shops and cafe. For the pool instead you need to have a pass. The hotel is also famous for star photo shoots!

(Original)
Un hotel di lusso storico a Los Angeles..all' interno anche alcuni negozi.. ovviamente prezzi non economici sia per le camere che per i negozi. È possibile comunque visitare la hall, I negozi e il cafè. Per la piscina invece bisogna avere il pass. L hotel è anche famoso per i servizi fotografici di star!</review>

Une nouvelle occasion de séjourner à l'Hotel Bel-Air avec cette fois le plaisir de découvrir la Stone Canyon Suite qui fut un temps la  Presidential Suite. Exceptionnel ! Un grand séjour avec salon doté d'une cheminée, un bureau, une Master Bedroom avec un espace coiffeuse, un dressing et une salle de bain superbe (+1 à l'entrée). La Suite s'ouvre sur un grand patio équipé en mobilier avec cheminée externe et un grand jacuzzi. Expérience extraordinaire à recommander et à vivre absolument.< /review>

Lhôtel est excentré mais très très agréable, un havre de paix, un magnifique jardin, une belle déco contemporaine et accueillante. Un service souriant qui ne dit jamais non, sisisis ça existe.Franchement génial. la seule chose, ne pas prendre la chambre VIP, grande et belle avec un petit bassin dehors MAIS très proche du système daération, climatisation de lhôtel donc un bruit non stop lorsquon est sur le balcon.</text>

<username>Hotels.com reviewer< /username><Review>Das Hotel befindet sich in einer sehr ruhigen Gegend von Bel Air. Die Zimmer wurden alle vor ca. zwei Jahren renoviert oder komplett neu erstellt. Der Zustand ist hervorragend. Wir hatten eine Canyon Premier Suite, welche unsere Erwartungen übertroffen hat.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It's wonderful, I think that 5 stars are "nothing", this beautiful and very authentic Hotel deserves another 5 stars. We went with my wife to have lunch with my friends Zach and Kami, being pleasantly amazed by everything, it is worth visiting it, its gardens scented in Jasmine, the greenery, its pool, seeing is a whole. Thanks guys!

(Original)
Es maravilloso , creo que 5 estrellas son la "nada", este bello y muy auténtico Hotel se merece otras 5 estrellas más.  Fuimos junto a mi señora a almorzar junto a mis amigos Zach y Kami , quedando gratamente maravillados por todo, vale muchísimo visitarlo, sus jardines perfumados en Jazmines, el verdor, su piscina, la ver es un todo.
