<Review>Was looking for a certain game and had to call around to locate it. I was directed to call the Panama location since they were the only one that had a copy. Brooke answered the phone and was asked if I'd like to have it held for the day. She was already helping a customer but greeted us when she had a moment. She was very pleasant to talk to and very knowledgeable. She told us about the membership special that was offered and all the perks. I was very excited to learn that I could use the rewards to purchase Microsoft points! I rarely have someone at games tops so informative and outgoing as Brooke. I will be returning to this location even though it is the furthest location from me.< /Review><user_id>115442468443032244243</user_id>< rate>

That's how I enjoy shopping at places. It invites you to not be afraid to buy the game you want. And they take the time to help you. Instead of rush you out and take your money lol like most game stops do. Trust me. If I want a game. I go here.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
The staff are great. We enjoying going in there cuz the staff are so helpful & curtious. My son is in the Navy, & was coming home for Christmas, & I had no clue what to buy him.(& I don't play video games at all. The only thing I knew; that he had a PS4) The staff asked a few questions about him, that I did know the answers to, & they made a suggestion of a game he might like. (Also letting me know I could return it if he didn't like it!!) My son came home, opened his gift, & LOVED the game!! The staff also let me know what was about to expire, via the points we had  earned, which really helped cuz it got me my sons game free, plus a huge discount on all the other items I was buying. I really appreciate the staffs help w/ this cuz as a mother, I just wanna see that smile of their faces, when you know you picked the right gift. They helped make that happen, for me & many others. I just can't give this store, & its staff, high enough marks. Thanks.< /Review>

Busy. Employees did not offer any help. Was there for about 30 minutes and not even a "hello" or "how can I help you?" Usually a young woman by the name of Brooke is there and she's very nice and helpful. Wasn't there today. Left empty.</Review>

Good customer service. Every time you walk in you hear "Hey welcome to gamestop" either followed by asking how you're doing or followed by a "we'll be with you in a sec." Good selection and are usually pretty well stocked. Only downside is depending on what's releasing and what time it is, it can be slightly understaffed but even then they manage to get through everyone.< /Review>

<Review>Very deceitful.  I was shopping around for about $500 of equipment.  Gamestop seemed slightly better, but only because the sales associate plainly lied about the benefits of the rewards program.  So, I spent an hour in their ridiculous line only to find out later I was cheated.  The manager pretended nice, but his actions did not reflect his demeanor.  They did not make the situation right.

Do not buy from this store.  Definitely do not expect any kind of rewards, rebates, or benefits that they promise.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Reserved a game for pickup at this location.  Get an email that says (and I quote) "Your item is Ready for Pick-up" as well as "We will hold your requested item for up to 24 hours".  Arrive there and the manager asks if she can help me.  As soon as I mention the game, she frowns and says, "I don't think I have any of those..." and goes to the back to check.  She comes out and confirms she does not.

Here's where it gets strange.  I try showing her the email, but before she looks at my phone she backs away and says excitedly, "If you didn't call we didn't reserve it!"...erratic behavior, and strangely aggressive for the manager of a customer service-oriented business.

I am now without the game I was looking forward to gifting for Christmas, all because either this Gamestop branch, or perhaps Gamestop as a company, don't seem to understand what "Your item is ready for pickup" means.  A supremely negative experience...will not be returning to Gamestop in the near future.</review>< name>

Very nice place but I hate when you call them you get an operating machine instead of real people you never get through the people to talk to me I just hang up better and drive all the way over there just a question or see the other game available.< /review>

Horrible. I go preorder GTA V on ps4 and no problems everythings fine. I had told the manager i have no id only a permit she said it was fine and to make sure i bring it. The next day i go to pick it up and a different person says no we cant give you your game without an id. She sees the previous manager said it was ok and still wont give me my game. I ask if i can cancel my preorder and if they can give me my money back. They say no you need an id for that too. They pretty much yook my money and gave nothing. Im still trying to get my game.< /Text>

<Review>The staff here was very helpful. I've had some bad experiences at VS stores, but this team seemed very on the ball and the girl at the register happily helped me order the product I was looking for. I expressed my concern with being in temporary housing so she expedited the shipping free of charge so that I would receive my package while I was still in my current place.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><username>Lylee Nguyen< /username><text>Came to make a return. Was not greeted by cashier. Line was super long and only 2 cashiers were available. A male cashier was too busy engaging in small talks to other employees, disregard the wait time of customers. A customer had to call him out about needing to make a purchase before he stopped his chit-chat. But after he helped that customer with her purchase. He continues to make small talks and did not help customers until he was calles out again. Very unprofessional. It's a shame that VS fails to filter out inconsiderate employees during their hiring process. With services like this, no wonder shopping traffic in malls are dying leaving many retail stores to closing. I will unlikely shop at this location again because they do not respect customers' time. Easier to shop online and get better quality--ie. Aeries from American Eagle.</text><Time>1576457083873<//Time><user>108632259252112107584<//user>< Gmap_id>

<text>Unfortunately, the lady helping with the person was so nice and helpful, so I hate giving 1 star... BUT.... When I was paying they offered me a REWARDS card. I said sure to the REWARDS card NOT A CREDIT CARD. They opened an account without my knowledge and charged my purchase on to it while I was trying to pay with my debit card. What a scam! I hate credit cards and now I have to go through the process of paying and closing the account. The staff should be more clear of what they are doing. Very disappointing...<//text><Date>1558154520164</Date>< Response>

<text>It is one of the major reasons that I go visit Tanforan Mall. It is usually not too busy with manageable waiting lines as well as reasonably well stocked items. The only weird thing was at the pass 2 times that I visited there (about 2 weeks apart), I saw police officers talking to their staff. Since the officer was taking notes, I don't think it was just chit chatting. Hopefully nothing major & VS will stay there.< /text>< Name>

I stopped by this location to possibly exchange a pair of underwear that I purchased a little bit before black Friday.

When I stopped by I asked an associate if they could assist me with finding the pair of underwear that I purchased in another size.  After asking the associate/ merchandiser  Samantha for help, she was not really responsive and was not inviting. She had a very mean dementor and did not go over and beyond to help me.

I decided to then go to the store manager Herold for assistance, and he began talking to me in a belittling way. I tried to ignore his rude approach to customer service. And came to the conclusion that maybe they were just stereotyping me because of the way I dressed or maybe even my race. I am very disappointed in the customer service at this store location, I'm an expert in the retail industry,  The way I was treated in this instance was heartbreaking. Maybe they dont like dark skin black women shopping at their store.

I no longer feel comfortable shopping and welcomed at this location. I will be filling a complaint.</Review>

< review>
Absolutely worth the money!!!   My flight left at 6:30 AM so I needed a pick up at 4 AM Zach pulled in right at 3:55!   He was nice, professional and most of all SAFE!!!   I’ve had bad rides a few times from this location to the airport at these early hours and I didn’t feel that at all!   Will use you every time I’m there which is a lot!

Thank you so much!< /review>

I traveled to San Diego for a business meeting with a client and booked Gold Coast Town Car Service. Mike was a pleasure to work with—very professional, personable, and timely. The travel experience was top-notch, and I'd recommend Mike and Gold Coast Town Car Service to anyone!< /review>

Beautiful and clean car! Our driver Juan was above and beyond. Not only on time, but early, eager and ready for us when we were ready to leave our wedding party. He was seriously one of the best drivers we had EVER seen. Knew exactly where he was going, attentive, and friendly. We were actually sad to say goodbye to him when the trip was done! If possible, ask for Juan when hiring Gold Coast - you will NOT be disappointed. We will definitely be using this service again!</text></record>

Mike and Anthony really go above and beyond every time to blow our expectations out of the water. I have never found a company so willing to go the extra mile. Their care and attentiveness is why you should use a town car service over Uber or Lyft! Highly recommend!< /Text>

Experience stress-free transportation with Mike & Team at Gold Coast Town Car.  For 7+ years in San Diego and Hawaii, my family gets impeccable service in meticulously clean, luxurious vehicles. Every staff member is professional, friendly, calm, capable. Seamless &  proactive: When our international flight was delayed, Gold Coast proactively pinged us, to say all was well.

We have been using Gold Coast Town Car Services for the past 6 years to and from the San Diego Airport. Mike and his team are fantastic !  The cars are immaculate, the drivers are friendly and professional and their fees are very reasonable.  They are always on time and it is easy to make arrival and departure changes when the airlines have schedule changes.  We have referred several friends who feel the same.  A great company.</Review>

Absolutely the most professional and dependable car service on Hawaii Island and in the Southern California area. They are our go-to car service for transport to and from San Diego and Kona International airports. Returning home to Kailua-Kona from travels, the longtime drivers have become friends over the years providing the friendliest, aloha-filled welcome home! Highly recommended!</Text>

<text>These guys are the real MVPs!  I had a group of 10 putting together a big bash all the way from San Diego to the House of Blues in Anaheim.  We needed a Limo in San Diego that wouldn't be afraid to drive on up to Disney.  Mike here at Gold Coast wasted no time in his response to help me put this together.  Fast and easy booking process, check!  Friendly and professional chauffeur, check!  Competitive and all-inclusive rates, check!  Super sick Mercedes Sprinter Limo, check!  Everyone happy and a damn good time, check!  Thanks again Gold Coast, we will be back for more.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Called up Visa Concierge last minute (midnight the night before for a 6am pickup). They pulled through and booked a car for myself and four colleagues with Gold Coast. Honestly, I had no idea what to expect but as soon as our driver (Anthony) picked us up my anxiety was immediately relieved! Anthony was as professional as can be. He went above and beyond to make sure our journey was seamless. With a little extra time at the end of our trip, he graciously gave my colleagues and I a tour of San Diego and surrounding areas. His knowledge was remarkable and it was an extremely pleasant experience overall. Car itself was excellent- luxurious, clean and tidy. Perfect for executive and business use.

Thank you again, Anthony!<//review>

My family and I had the pleasure of working with Mike and Anthony while we visited San Diego. To say that they are both exceptional professionals would be an understatement. I had extensive interaction with Mike prior to the trip in coordinating various excursions that we had planned and details that kept changing, and he was always extremely timely and kind and accommodating in his responses. We first met Anthony when we arrived at the airport, and we were so impressed by what a genuine gentleman and knowledgeable professional he was that we requested him for our other excursions, and Mike did his very best to accommodate that request. My family had unique needs, and both Anthony and Mike went out of their way to meet those needs and to make our excursions so very enjoyable and comfortable. As a federal criminal defense attorney, I am extremely particular and always look for people who practice their professions in the manner in which I practice law. Mike and Anthony are at the top of their profession, and I highly recommend them without any reservation and look forward to working with them again in the future.<//Review>

<Time>1519759782930</Time><rating>5<//rating><Text>We have been using Mike for several years and he is the only consistently reliable service we have found in San Diego.  Professional, friendly service and always on time (actually always arrives early).  Perfect for transfers to SAN and LAX airports or even a trouble-free relaxing ride to Vegas if you want to avoid the hassles of flying or driving yourself.  Unlike the inconsistent and often regrettable experiences we have had, using the well-known car service apps on our phones,  Mike and his team never disappoint and will always be our go-to for any car service needs in San Diego.  Even for last minute rides you may need late at night, or for a spontaneous getaway without much advance notice, or a last minute itinerary change, Mike and his team are always accommodating.  Anytime we contact Mike with a question or to set up a ride, he gets back to us right away, making trip planning quick, easy, and painless.< /Text>< pics>

5 STAR all the way!  Mike, Alan and Alan made our wedding anniversary trip to San Diego stress free with their SUPERB service. Not only did they meet my somewhat last minute schedule, they did it with professionalism, kindness and a can do attitude. They all made my husband and me feel like we were family and not simply a client.  I was handed a rose of all things on our ride to dinner one night! Amazing group of individuals.  Thank you ALL so much.  I HIGHLY recommend GOLD COAST TOWN CAR SERVICES to anyone that visits San Diego or surrounding areas.  I will be back!!</Review>

<Text>Bottom line, they are the best town car service company available.  I don't normally take the time to write reviews for companies, but this one went above and beyond what was required of them that I want to let others know what an outstanding company they are.

They have excellent communication and are so accommodating to their customers' needs.  They are really on top of things.  When their passenger's plane was delayed, they still were there when they landed as they monitor the passenger's flight status and plan accordingly.<//Text><gmapID>0x80d9553afcd7730b:0x481b3d59c9765ce5< /gmapID><Time>1391620822717</Time></record>

I absolutely love Gold Coast and their staff!!!!

I first learned of the car service back in November 2016, from a colleague who recommended them for taking me to the airport for business travel.

I have not strayed since.

I refuse to use an uber or lyft simply because of the impeccable service Mike and his team provides. I love their SUVs, usually Tahoe sized and above. Always clean inside, and it smells amazing!

Whoever comes to pick you up from home/airport will help you with your bags, which I truly appreciate as I am not as physically capable as I used to be in my youth.

The staff appearance is professional, usually in either a full suit or business casual -- more on the business side. Their attitudes and friendliness go a long way. I appreciate every ride they have ever given me.

You can't go wrong with Gold Coast. They have never left me stranded, no matter what time of the day I need to be picked up. I think the latest/earliest time once was when I arrived into San Diego at 3:00 AM! Mike always makes sure that either he or another one of his drivers is there to take you home safely.

If for whatever reason, the driver gets held up, they will let you know and communicate it to you ASAP via text or phone call. One time a driver of mine got held up by traffic. No big deal, I was able to kill time by smoking a cigarette and stretching my legs after a long flight.

They are very accommodating to the fact that stuff happens! If your flight gets delayed, just text Mike ASAP and he will make sure that there is someone there to get you.

5 stars to Mike and his team. You guys are awesome!< /Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Upon moving here out of state, I was looking for a dentist office that was welcoming, attentive to care, and methodical in speaking to my oral hygiene. The entire staff, dentist, and hygienist were all these things! The ambiance is calming and non-judgmental. Everything was explained before, during, and after any dental care. I cannot wait to go back again and again. I will stick with this office through and through just based on the very good first experience and impressions I had.<//Text><user_name>Evan Faidley</user_name></record></dataset><record>

This was the third dentist office that I’ve been to in the past 4 years and today was my first visit. I am more than happy to share my 10 star experience at this place because they all deserve it. Dr. Tran as well as all his assistants that I’ve met, Sam and Bianca exceeded my expectations. They’re all professional, down to earth, hospitable and above all care about making me leave happy. I’m yet to experience his work, but I’m confident that I found the right dentist. They have me and my family clients for life. Thank you again!</text>

<Text>These people are super friendly, gentle, and know their stuff. I have GAD and trauma related to a childhood dentist, but Dr. Tran and his assistant Sam took their time with me and assured me I'd be ok, and to let them know if I needed to stop at any time.
The office is state of the art, the dentistry practiced here is just brilliant and very gentle. Staff are amazing.
Thank you guys!<//Text>< pics>

Extremely friendly staff. No wait time, you walk in and go straight to the chair. Great setup with the streaming services (Roku, Netflix, etc) and very nice to see the XRAYs happening and having explanations. Josh Tran is conservative and straight forward about your options and what he sees. Also pricing seems reasonable.< /Review>

Dr. Tran is a professional dentist!
I have excellent experience in his office and about wisdom tooth extraction he did for me. It took about 10 mints. overall!! I really glad I switched to Highland Dental.
I strongly recommend Dr. Tan as your dentist.

I had an excellent experience at Highland Dental. This was my first visit with them; the office was clean and the staff was very friendly. The exam rooms are modern and comfortable - they offered to play music or you can watch TV during your cleaning. The hygienist was really sweet and did a great job with my cleaning - even showed me a before and after :) Dr Tran was very easy to talk to and made sure he addressed any questions I had. Overall I would highly recommend Highland Dental and am glad I made the switch.< /text>

<review>I have had horrible experiences getting dental work done in the past, which has caused extreme anxiety going to the dentist, which had also resulted in me delaying treatment. I expressed these concerns today at my appointment as I was receiving 5 fillings today to Samantha as she was the one assisting the Doctor. She was very kind and understanding of my anxiety. She prepped me for the fillings by giving me numbing gel. So all I felt was a minor pinch while they injected the local anesthetic. Have two shots, I didn't feel a thing. They made sure I was comfortable. I was even able to listen to Frank Sinatra on the TV while they worked on my teeth. Literally the Best Dental Experience I have ever had.

Thank you Highland Dental! 🦷<//review></record></dataset><record>

I’ve had my fair share of horrible experiences, the horror stories about the dentist we all dread 😣 For the first time in my life I have had such a wonderful experience! Every person I came in contact with in the office were so nice and seem genuinely happy to be there. Rudy did such a great job cleaning my teeth while being gentle & explaining every step of the process. The doctor  was the nicest dentist I’ve ever met in my life. I’m looking forward to continuing treatment with this amazing team!<//Text>

I strongly recommend this dental clinic.  Dr. Tran is excellent and he takes care to explain and discuss what he is doing.  His staff are also highly competent and thoughtful, and always smiling.  I had quite a long course of treatment and never felt bad after a visit.  The atmosphere in the clinic is wonderful.  If you have a protracted visit, fitting crowns for example (the crowns are made in house, which saves a visit), you can watch a movie or listen to music.</Text>

Went to get O rings for my lower denture/implants. Left no better off than when I came in, just $200 poorer. What did I get for my $200? An apology! That’s not what I was looking for, I was hoping for dental service. Disgusting!<//Review>

Another excellent visit to Highland Dental!  Great care, great staff, great music. I am a long term client and my only complaint is that my wait time is always too short so I can’t drink my coffee!  😁.  My family is happy with Highland as well. If you are local and ready for a change, just do it.</text>

I was greeted by beautiful smiles. Check in was fast and easy, no paper work. Love the office setting and it's high tech. I have to say Rudy is probably one of the best hygienist I've come across. He take his time with you, very gentle with your teeth but yet thorough. Last person I met was Dr. Tran, we talked briefly about my teeth. He seem like a nice person, he has a happy face :). I love happy faces. From today's visit, I would say this is the best first visit experience to a dental office.<//text>

Rudy is by far, the best dental hygienist!  I have been coming Highland Dental for more 8 years.  Today I come here for the routine cleaning which I didn’t do it for a while.  Rudy is so professional; engaging; friendly; thorough; gentle and patient.  He takes time to explain everything and spends almost one hour to do a regular clearing ( not a deep clearing).  Moreover, Rudy is willing to go extra mile to instruct me how to use waterpik to take care of my teeth.  I have never felt more comfortable at a dental office and know I will be back every 6 months.  That is what I call caring.  And this is hands down the best dental office in Hayward.  I strongly recommend Highland Dental to anyone who is looking for a quality treatment you can trust.</review>

I went to Highland Dental for the first time today and it was great! They have tons of new technology from updated  x-ray machines to T.Vs in the exam rooms. My hygienist took before and after pictures of my cleaning and was explaining at every step. He had some great information for me about what was happening with my teeth and about cavity prevention specifically for me. My experience was extremely customer centered. They really did a great job and I felt like the cleaning was super thorough and professional. I will definitely make this my new dentist and will recommend them to friends.</Review>

Always a good experience at Highland. All of the staff are exceptionally skilled, knowledgeable and efficient. I have been to more than a few dentists over the years and Dr. Tran is by far the best and always surprisingly fast. Since I started going to Highland, I've never doubted that I receive the best possible dental care.</review>

Highland dental is the best, and Dr. Tran is very professional and knowledgeable. Before I found this place I have been to many dental offices, but never felt like I found the right place. I highly recommend Highland dental if you are looking for a dental office that care for their patients.</Review>

Had my second visit yesterday (first visit 6 months ago).  I am very happy I found this office when I moved to CA.  Everyone on staff from receptionists to dentist are caring and friendly.  There is a genuine approach to tooth and gum care and I don't feel like I'm getting pressured for additional services. They listen...and respond to me as a patient.  I highly recommend this office.<//text>

<text>Coming here for a number of years. This dental office is a real gem. The doctors are very skilled and us the latest technologies. For example perfectly fitting crowns and bridges are produced in the office within the same session on computer-controlled machines based on computer-based measurements taken by the doctor. Highly recommended!</text>< Pictures>

They have both treated my wife for a couple years now and have been incredible with her, and seeing how great they were with her was the only thing that even got me in the chair. The more we’ve gotten to know them, the more we’ve found that these are genuinely sweet people who really care about their patients. Professional, knowledgeable, and incredibly caring... I don’t know what more you can ask for. Well, perhaps you could ask that your dentist has an excellent support staff as well? They have that covered, too.

<rate>1<//rate><review>My husband and I have been coming here for a while. They recommended I have a deep cleaning which I had done (paid mostly out of pocket). Later when I go for my 6 month regular cleaning the receptionist at the front tells me that I have to pay out of pocket. The reason being you have to have a special cleaning after a deep cleaning. They weren't upfront about the cost of this beforehand. I feel  misled by them. Costs need to be stated upfront. It shouldn't be a surprise the day of the cleaning! Receptionist wasn't really helpful apart from stating 'oh you should have been told but I guess sometimes there's an error in communication'. I canceled my appointment and canceled my kids appointment with them
too.< /review>< Pics>

<review>I have been going to Highland for the last couple years and I appreciate the friendliness and efficiency of the dental assistants.  My appointments take no more than 30 minutes.  The only thing is I have asked for referrals and they said they would call me back but they haven't; though honestly I also could call them back - it's just hard to find the time during the day. :)</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808f94781190b53b:0xfb133aa4a6da1b40<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Tran in particular was probably one of the nicest doctors i ever met. i asked him questions and he took his time explaining things to me when i asked more. this is too often taken for granted. doctors dont have a lot of time and to find one willing to explain whatever questions you have is not too common. thank you for the great experience Highland Dental! i will be back soon. and i will recommend this place to any people who need a caring dentisty!<//Text>< Resp>

<review>I’m usually terrified of going to the dentist because I just had really bad experience in the past, but at highland dental, everyone I mean everyone is super friendly and the way the staff talks to you is as if they genuinely care. They also send a lot of reminders and makes it super simple for anything you need in terms of booking appointments their flexibility is awesome.< /review>< Pictures>

This was the first time I have been to the dentist where I enjoyed and wanted to stay and chat. I loved that they use the latest technology also the staff were great, friendly and respectful.  My appointment was at eleven got there early and they were ready, no time wasted. I even learned about posting on Yelp.  Thank you can’t wait for my next appointment< /Review>

<Review>I've been going to Highland Dental for about a year and a half now and I'm very glad I made the switch.

When I first started coming my teeth weren't in great shape. Dr. Tran and Rudy both gave me good, non-judgmental advice on how I could improve my dental health. They took pictures of my teeth and explained clearly what the issues were amd what might happen if I didn't take care more care of my teeth. Most importantly, I didn't feel like they were shaming me or trying to make me feel bad. In fact, they were very understanding and because of that I took their advice very well.

My teeth look so much better than they did over a year ago when I first started at Highland. I understand why I need to keep up my dental health and I understand how to do it best. I come in every 6 months with new questions and always get helpful answers.

I highly recommend Highland Dental for their professional and effective care - and of course the awesome TVs on the ceiling that make cleaning that much easier. ;)<//Review>< user>

Best Dentist experience ever!
Professional front office and the dental support staff are the best.  Modern equipment showed me exactly the state of my teeth
Dr Tran was kind and professional and explained the procedure in including the treatment plan in simple terms, very good experience for me

Changed my perception of a dental visit!< /Text>

<Text>The people are great and friendly. The staff know what they’re doing. The make the experience smooth and convenient. Everything is modern. They hand you an iPad for check-in. While getting your teeth cleaned you can choose a movie to watch on Netflix or listen to music. There’s even a screen overhead while you’re lying down. Cleanings are thorough and advice is spot on.

The dental office has advanced dental equipment. It makes the treatments much easy with  high quality. The environment is neat and clean.
The practice of Dr. Josh Tran is professional. He is a good listener, with patience. He answered all of my questions with details.
The dental visit turned out to be pleasure and satisfied with the job well done.<//text>

EVERYONE IS AMAZING. Let me start by saying this...I HATE THE DENTIST but everyone made sure they changed that. From the moment I walked in the door to when I left back out, best experience ever. Very personable, thorough, and accommodating.< /text>

I used to hate going to the dentist until I started going to Highland Dental!  They are very friendly, explain everything and make you feel very comfortable! I have very sensitive gums and they are so careful I dont even feel any pain like with other dentists.  I also love that you can watch TV,  Netflix when they are working on your mouth so time flies and you ate entertain!  I highly recommend Highland Dental!<//review>

They (and their great staff) make you feel right at home and enjoy being there - as much as a dental visit can be enjoyed.  =)  They know their stuff and continue to keep up-to-date with changes so that they can really provide the best to their clients.The office itself looks really nice too -- but I've seldom had much time to enjoy it since they work really hard so that folks really are never waiting around for the dentist.< /Review>< pics>

I came here after reading all of the glowing reviews, and having a less than satisfactory appointment elsewhere. Both the dentist, and dental hygienist were extremely clear and helpful in their explanations of the issues I had with my teeth and the treatment necessary. I will be continuing my future dental services with Highland Dental of Hayward as long as I live in the bay.<//text>

My crown came off prematurely and Dr. Josh fixed it at no charge. Dr. Josh is a good person and provides excellent customer service.

He was responsive when I complained and came in specifically on his off day to replace my crown.</Text>

It was my first time going to a dental office in two years and it felt like I have been going there for years. Rudy the hygienist was so willing to answer all of my questions and Dr.Tran was very lay back and easy to talk to.  Before I left they made everything very clear of what are my next steps and what it will cost me, so no surprise fees at my next appointment, YAY! The office is transparent and they make sure you know of everything that is going on, nothing is done behind your back.  They take before and after pictures of your teeth, with a High Quality camera. I haven't stopped talking about my experience, its a great fit for everyone.< /review>

<text>I love this dentist office. I have been going here for about 3 years now. The staff is very friendly, and especially nice to my toddler (whom I also take here). I went in yesterday because they had a slow day and could fit me in early and since they didn’t want me to have to come back in they even got my filling done same day. They have TV’s so you can watch tv while they work on your teeth.</text>< pictures>

I'm always hesitant to try new places when it comes to...well...anything. The staff were super helpful and friendly. Dr. Villas is awesome. She came in and listened to me rant about what I'm looking for in a provider and what I'm hoping to accomplish by switching doctors. She met and exceeded my expectations. As I have only been there once, I can't say too much (which is why I kept it at 4 stars). But so far, so great. I'm looking forward to my next visit! (Who says that about a dentist? This girl does!).</review>< Pics>

Love my Dentist and the staff.  I started going to Highland Dental in a crisis situation two years  ago-They got me through that situation with genuine concern not just for my damaged teeth, but for me.  I've been going back ever since. Wonderful and efficient staff, great Dentist, client friendly atmosphere and they are on time! I would give them more stars if I could-Highland Dental is the best!<//text>

The staff were very courteous and knowledgeable. I saw Dr. Tran and he consulted with me, did what we minimally had to do in order to create a treatment plan. It felt very honest and down to earth. I have not had the best experiences with dentist. I seem to keep fixing the same teeth. My gut tells me this may be the dentist I have been looking for. I’ll keep you informed as the next year goes on. We all know some differences occur between patients but I’ll try to remember to update this. Keep smiling.</Text>

I've been coming here for more than two years now and every time the experience is great regardless of the procedure: cleaning, fillings or root canal. I like friendly and professional staff and their sense of ownership of their work, I like that this office (both culture and equipment) is not stuck in 20th century.<//Review>

<user>101272572996630847893< /user><text>Practice is neat, cute, and very clean. Very helpful staff and both doctors were awesome. Really felt like my dentist and the staff were honest to me and cut out the bs. The dentists here are friendly and have sense of humor!
They fixed my issue fast and easy, and the results looked awesome! They broke down the costs and were understanding about the financial part.
Trusting a dentist is like trusting your mechanic, if you know nothing about it you have no idea if they are ripping you off or not. But with a dentist its a little harder to get a second opinion without spending more money! So I loved that everyone was straight forward, with the good and bad for both parties. I fully trust these dentists and their staff, I will keep coming back.
And its pretty neat that both husband and wife are dentists working together :)</text>< Rating>

<Text>I've been a patient for about 2 years now. I am very happy with my dental hygienist, Rudy. He is patient, communicative (he let's me know what he's doing and about to do), and very thorough. I do feel I'm in good hands with Rudy. I look forward to my cleanings every six months, as long as he's there.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Highland Dental has the perfect combination of location, modern decor and technology, and great people. Everyone is incredibly friendly yet professional.  There are screens in the corner of the exam rooms and also hung from the ceiling so you can watch shows while your teeth are being cleaned (you get to choose what to watch on Netflix, Hulu, etc.).  I appreciate the explanations and pictures shared while examining and cleaning.  Definitely happy to return for future appointments.</Text>< resp>

It had been quite some time since my last dental office visit. Needless to say, I was a bit concerned about what my experience would be. Thankfully I am pleased to say that this has been the best dental office experience I have ever had. Very pleasant and personable staff from the 2 receptionists to the dental assistant and doctor.

Unfortunately they are not within the Metlife dental network :/. I may have seek out another doctor who is.<//Review>

<review>Definitely one of the best dental offices I've ever been to. The office is clean, dental equipment is high-tech, they offer refreshments and Netflix or music in the patient rooms - how cool is that?! But most of all, the staff is the absolute best part of my dental visit. Dr. Sahota and her assistant Samantha made me feel really comfortable during my visit. They were non judgmental and enthusiastic about oral hygiene habits and options for treatment. Vanessa helped by explaining my insurance benefits as well.<//review><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I am among those out there who have an ilogical fear of going to the dentist. Let's just say I am not a stickler about going every six months as I know I should. The team at Highland Dental were very non-judgemental, made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. Rudy explained everything he did before he did it so I was prepared, and checked in on me just the right amount to make sure I was doing ok. He was thorough but with a gentle hand - much easier than other cleanings I have experienced.
Eventhough I live 30 mins from the office, it is well worth the trip and am proud to say that I already booked my 6 month follow up.

Thanks again!</Review><time>1567041239458<//time><user>115231214911554819824</user><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

I brought my son to Highland dental for his first check up. He was incredibly nervous after having had a poor experience with a medical physician a year ago and really wasn’t keen at all to see a dentist. The staff here were excellent at each and every step.  They spoke to him like he was a person, explained what would happen and took the time to make sure he was comfortable.

The actual check up was detailed well carried out and everyone was really relaxed and made things go really smoothly. I honestly could not be happier. Thank you so much for making my sons experience with dental care such a positive one<//review>

<Review>Highland dental is super convenient for anyone who lives in Hayward Highland area. The staff is friendly and make you feel at ease. They were great with my son who is 4 . I've had a root canal as well as a couple of caps done there. And will be going back for more caps.
One of my favorite things about this place is that they have plenty of 📺 to watch , even while you are laid back in the chair. With access to Netflix, Hulu ,ESPN, You Tube and many others. I actually look forward to going to the dentist😀.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>the best dentist I ever had

I am so happy I found this dentist office. Dr. Tran is the best, and the whole office works together like a team.  Everyone treats patients with a lot of respect and kindsness, and they make sure you dont feel pain. It is also wonderful that they can do crowns in one seating - you go in, you leave 2 hours later, and everything is done . I made my husbands and my kids switch here too. Also, no problems finding parking, and easy to reach.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>Always a pleasant experience! The office is beautifully decorated and comfortable. Nice TVs available in each room with Netflix, Hulu, and Pandora, Youtube Tv, they are definitely up with the times. The staff is always personable and very knowledgeable about what is best for your dental health.

Josh and Verna and the whole team are great! Very personable and very skilled! I've went in for cleanings, pulling my wisdom teeth, and a root canal... although unfortunate, I am very fortunate that I have them to make each process very easy to go through. Not sure if it's my toughness or just them knowing what they're doing but I can honestly say my major jobs (wisdom teeth and root canal) did not  hurt as bad as everyone keeps saying.

They use the most up to date technology I've never even known about! And you can listen to music or watch a movie while getting work done haha. Definitely a plus.

Plain and simple I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new dentist.</text>

Amazing staff, awesome customer service, incredibly talented team. Beautiful interior as well, got two screens with Netflix in each room, one on the wall and one facing down for you to watch as you’re getting worked on. The beautiful ladies at the reception desk offered me tea or coffee as well, and were lighthearted and playful which also created a fun and comfortable environment. Instead of doing paperwork for my first time at the office, all forms were done quite easily on a tablet, which was frickin kickass. A pretty girl named Celia cleaned and flossed my teeth, who was very likeable to say the least, and Doctor Joshua Tran was exceedingly knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I usually don’t do reviews for anywhere at anytime, but I know how hard it is to find a good dental group, and I have no doubt your experience will be the same if not better 😏</Review>

<Review>Dr. Tran and his staff are by far the BEST dental group I have ever had. Everyone is friendly, the office is immaculate and Rudy is the best dental hygienist ever! My TMJ has NEVER flared up during my procedures or cleanings. Dr. Tran has the latest technology, he uses the Cerec machine to do crowns onsite on the same day! With my first crown (different dentist), I had to wait weeks for my crown to arrive and when it arrived it was not the best fit. No so with Dr. Tran , patient care is his priority and it shows! Thank you everyone at Highland Dental of Hayward.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Got a same day appoitment for a bad toothache and everything went good (customer service at front desk , getting registered,etc) nice office, clean, TVs to watch in the exam room while your waiting is cool.  Quick to get me into exam after check in and paperwork ..They took-x-ray of tooth only to tell me they couldn't help with my problem. A wisdom tooth needing to be pulled so they referred me to an oral surgeon, so no way I'm getting this tooth that is giving me extreme pain on Saturday afternoon that oral surgeon was NOT open on Saturdays . Next thing. Dentist was nice and prescribed antibiotic and a Norco.  However, the front desk gave me a prescription for JUST the antibiotic. Being in so much pain and me not thinking to look at the prescription before leaving, I went all the way to my pharmacy only to discover Highland Dental staff only gave 1 prescription for the antibiotic . I had to call them, and them go BACK to the office to get rhe Norco prescription .Why couldnt they have called it in you ask? Norco cant be called or faxed in apparently it can only be hand written by the dentist and dropped off at pharmacy to be FILLED. Not the best first experience hence the three stars other than that I probably would recommended to someone cuz this is maybe a minor thing just inconvenient and disappointed to have to wait to get my tooth pulled to have some relief long-term.<//Review>

Second time there. Routine work and cleaning. Once again, courteous, professional, knowledgeable and accommodating. Great space and location. Parking is easy. Wifi and Netflix while you wait or during your procedure. Very detailed explanation for potential issues I may have in the near future and provided advice on how I can slow the process.<//Review>

<text>Highland Dental of Hayward has been great for our family. After trying multiple dental offices in the bay area for us and our kids we knew this was the place after the first visit. My oldest came home from his first visit and I did not have to remind him to brush his teeth and has since taken much better care of his teeth.  On my last cleaning  my 5 year old wanted to watch and visit the Doctors. After they finished my appointment she asked the Doctor if she could get her teeth cleaned, they made room for her and proceeded to clean her teeth. For the first time she did not complain or have any issues throughout the checkup and cleaning process. I am so revealed to have found Dr Tran, Dr Villas, and all their staff for my family's dental care.</text><Gmap_id>0x808f94781190b53b:0xfb133aa4a6da1b40</Gmap_id><time>1416508010804<//time><pictures>None<//pictures><name>R2D2 173<//name><Rate>5<//Rate><user_id>106470273310628577876< /user_id></record>

<rate>5</rate><text>I never take time to write reviews......let alone for a dentist visit!  But as I finished having the best experience ever at a dentist I felt compelled to write a review. Everyone was personable, and professional. The place looks more like a spa than a dentist office. The first time I called, Chau answered the phone. Nice and professional. Knows how to make you feel at ease. As I came in, I was greeted by Virna, one of the owners and a dentist. Professional and very pleasant and in her down time a wonderful decorator.....as she designed the place!
Her husband, Josh, did my exam and my cleaning together with Jessica. Hands down the best experience I have ever had at a dentist! I would certainly drive to see them again, which is a statement in itself, the good news is that I dont have to: they are around the corner. Come see them! You will gain in more than one way.
Congratulations Highland Dental for a job well done!<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><review>This was THE BEST experience I've ever had at a dentist (or any doctor for that matter!). The whole office is chic and nicely done with a medium sized neat waiting room which I sat in for less than 5 minutes. The intake form is laminated (yay for being eco-friendly!) and everyone from both receptionists to the hygienist and Dr were professional, knowledgeable and made me feel right at ease. Huge plusses for having TWO tv's in the room with Netflix! I will definitely be coming back!<//review>< Pictures>

I love the fact the the billing staff is up front regarding what my insurance may or may not cover. Also love the fact that my dentist called twice to make sure I was ok after the root canal procedure. My husband picked up my phone since I was driving when she called the 2nd time, and he even agreed that most dentist would not have made the 2nd call.<//text>

Came to get my car serviced for brakes and oil change and received excellent service from the front desk right away. Service techs were very professional and gave me a full detail on the service they were going to perform. My car was left in perfect condition definitely making them my preferred tech for any future services to my car.

Great customer service overall. Jose is so thorough when he explains things.  This is the best shop I’ve ever been to and the only one I’ll ever trust.<//text>

I don’t know anything about cars, but my friend recommended this place, and I’m so happy I went. Anabel at the front desk was so friendly and made me feel  comfortable and that I could ask as many questions as I wanted. It’s family owned, so it seems like the siblings work really well together. The shop and waiting area is really clean and doesn’t even feel like an auto repair shop.

My car had been making a noise and it ended up being a piece of metal hitting the wheel. They fixed the problem and also did an inspection. I even got pictures sent to my phone so I could show my dad what was going on with my car. I ended up fixing a couple of things that I had no idea needed to be fixed.

I am glad I went and definitely feel like I can trust them with my car.</review>

<Review>Never grew up enthusiastic about cars so when my “inner fender,” I think that’s it, got damaged I was a little lost. I drive a lot and my son is usually in the car with me so getting such good customer service during my quote call meant a lot. They were really honest and knowledgeable about how to fix that peace above my tire, while remaining patient with me. The service price is fair and I will be writing a follow up on how the job comes out after my appointment. Thanks again guys!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I make the drive all the way from Baldwin Park to Colton because I trust them to do the work correctly and efficiently, so it’s worth it to go out of my way. Also my experience with other shops that might charge less is that you definitely get what you pay for. Proshop will go out of their way and I trust them to take care of my car and my parents cars, too. Last time I came in they did an amazing job with my oil changed in my car service I definitely recommend them 10 out of 10 ! 👌🏼< /Text>

<Text>Definitely my “go to” shop for everything in auto repair. I have been their client  for years and recommend them highly. This particular visit was maintenance but they have been exceptional with engine work, AC and heat issues among other things.< /Text>< user_id>

I love Proshop! I love to spend my money at family owned and operated yet professional vendors. They are so honest too! If they say you need it, you need it. Not like other places where thy just try to take advantage of you as a woman or that fact that you don't know much about cars. They actually take the time to educate you and make sure you understand what is going on with your car. I also like the fact that they take pictures so they can show you what is literally wrong with you car. I would definitely recommend this place.<//text>

Good service. I went by myself (as a girl) and didn’t feel like they played any games or tried to talk me into fixing something I didn’t need. I went for an oil change, they changed it, gave me some tips on things that could be updated soon (filters, spark plugs - with pictures provided on this handy webpage feature they use) without forcing me to do it on the spot, and that was it. The price for the oil change was really good too, about $35-$40.< /Text>

<text>This was my first time visiting Proshop Automotive and I will definitely be returning and sending them anyone I know who needs their car looked at . I was happily surprised with the way they make this report along with pictures of the issues your vehicle might be having along with a color code that tells you how bad it is . I think people will appreciate this extra thing they do because they include an actual picture of the problem area from your car and send it to you in the report so you know there’s an actual problem . Also super helpful if your husband or wife is at work and you need to share the cars’ issues and agree or not on a repair . The staff is super polite and attentive , the place is super comfortable with bottled waters and coffee as you wait .</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Proshop Automotive is cutting edge. The technology they use is incredibly impressive. Plus, there is a check-in system that prompts and email with a link to your car's service record. There, you can view recommendations, see photos of the problems the technicians find, and you can approve or deny any work (and see all estimates) before you find yourself stuck with sticker shock. These guys are thorough and super polite and friendly. If you have questions, they take the time to answer them. I'm a repeat customer and will continue to be their customer in the future. They make car repairs as painless as possible. Plus, if you are within 10 miles of the shop, they will come pick up your vehicle and bring it back to you when the work is done. Each time they have worked on my car, they even bring it back washed and shiny - inside and out. I hate having my car serviced. HATE IT! However, the great folks over at Proshop Automotive make it so easy and painless that it's actually kinda fun! I sincerely appreciate the photos they post with any of their findings. That helps you see that you're not being snowed over. There is never any pressure to do any of the work they recommend. They're just as polite to you if you tell them to do it all as they are if you decline all the recommendations. Super fun bunch! Superior customer service! Excellent repair work. Cutting edge technology. But, what's really cool is the effort and care that goes into considering their customer needs. These guys genuinely care and it shows. I will keep taking my car to Proshop Automotive because I feel completely comfortable and these guys have earned my trust - which says a lot because I'm always skeptical. So, I give this shop an A+! 5-Stars! Two thumbs up! Whatever rating system you prefer, they get all the marks! Great job, Esteban, Jose, and all the Proshop staff! Thank you for your care and concern! It means a lot.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>My husband went in today without an appointment and he was in and out in like an hour and a half. They were very professional and straight to the point in regards to the diagnostic of my car. We found out what was wrong with my car as well as they showed him the reports of the diagnostic and explained everything in detail of what was wrong. They recommended options that we could take before fully committing to fixing anything major — they even told us that there was a recall on the airbag of the passenger side. I would definitely recommend coming to this place. They are very professional and informative. One last thing, after the diagnostic—they won’t fix anything without your authorization. This is a huge/major plus on those who are very weary on places that would do things to your car without your approval.< /Review><user_id>103291696742795914962<//user_id><gmapID>0x80dcad29f729a895:0x4b4a26f85ec574a3<//gmapID></record>

I have finally found an honest, worry free place to take my car. Before, as a single woman I would take my car for repairs and almost always get ripped off. Now I have no worries and I recommend them to everyone that needs auto repairs.  When I have questions, the owner addresses my concerns and takes time to explain. He is very knowledgeable. The mechanic is excellent in his quality of repairs. The office staff is always friendly and eager to help.  See for yourself the quality and great Customer Service Pro Shop has to offer.<//Text>

The work we do and the customer service we provide is the most important parts of our business. It was a surprise to see your comment since the only interactions we've had with you have been over the phone in well over a year when you've called for a couple of estimates. As we've explained, it is quite difficult to assess the entirety of your needs without actually seeing the vehicle (especially since its been so long). If pricing is your top concern, we do hope you are able to find a shop that can provide you with services at the rate you need. We are sorry that we can't be your shop of choice but wish you good luck on your car service needs."}</resp>

<text>I love this place because they create a great family friendly environment for people to play and get better at soccer. Parking can be hectic at times and you definitely need to keep an eye on your kids because it can get crowded at peak hours.< /text>< Pictures>

Got assigned an interview to which they made me a resume without my consent, I had told the company I didn’t write it. Horrible experience with this company I do not recommend.< /review>

<Name>adrian brambila< /Name><text>I got a call around 10 am and was told that there was a job opening and they need me to be there at 12pm and i took the job.. i was told I could bring a friend. then I get another call from balance staffing saying pretty much the same thing just to clarify, I guess. I asked the lady on the other side of the phone if I could bring a friend like they first said because I had already told my friend about it he wanted to work too. Then she says I can’t, so I ask then “why was I told I could bring a friend?” She said she was going to have to call me back. I said ok. I called them at11:30 because I haven’t heard not a word from balance staffing or anyone. I get a call back about 5 minutes later saying that I had lost the opportunity because I gave her attitude. What kind of system they working with. Terrible experience. Never will I work for balance staffing again.</text><Gmap_id>0x8090541d39346853:0x8c17e9c5f6387cdb</Gmap_id><user>109584148118892379910<//user>< resp>

I just wanted to say thank you too Michelle and Patricia for landing me a solid job. I came into balance staffing back in may. They were very professional. And took my skills and experience seriously. A week later I was placed at Don fresco a fantastic company with many great employees. They are very respectfully and welcoming there. I must say I have worked for many employees who can care less about there employees and there capabilities. Don fresco is a wonderful working environment. Full of family oriented individuals. Truly a blessing to go to work here. 5****< /Text>

Second time using this agency to find work. Service was fast and much better than my previous experiences. Met with Jose and he was able to find me a great job. Kept me updated all the way by text and phone. Jose also personally helped to set up a great interview and Michelle from Balance Staffing was there on my first day at my new job to walk me through the door and ensure I met the right people. My experience so far has been great and I felt really well prepared. Highly recommended.<//review>

You have to call many times to get a hold of a recruiter. Then when they say they'll call back they never do. They used to be a good place to work with but not anymore.< /Text>

If you have the full intention to complete the process of finding work and being steady, these people will help you walk through this with deliberation.

Bless Maria and her ladies and men. They've not only listened to me and many more working people, but they helped me find suitable work in a friendly and meaningful way.

I'm very grateful to Balance Staffing of Modesto.< /text>

<pics>None</pics><review>Things looked promising in the beginning applying at this temp. agency. I had seen their job post for a job fair that they were holding for a major production company in the Bay Area in Nov. 2016. I attended the job fair, applied, and then followed up with their interview and assessment dates that same week. I had passed the tests and the assessment they had; filled out the necessary documents to work for them, and was sent out for a physical. At the time, others including myself were informed that it may take up to 3-4 weeks before being contacted about a start date. Two weeks passed by before I decided to contact the agency to see how things were going and I was notified that I was one of several who had called about the progress and was told to wait until after the holidays (I called the week before Thanksgiving.) and to wait for a call. So I did. At that time, I had already received a payment card and a copy of my background in the mail. Thanksgiving came and went, so did Christmas, and New Year's. Around January I tried contacting them several times, but no one seems to answer their phones. And the option to leave a message was out of the question because their voicemail was also full. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of a receptionist on two occasions and leave a message for the recruiter I had applied with. I got no reply back, not even an email. This started to be a waste of my time. Being optimistic, I had also applied at the Stockton branch when they had their job fair for the same assignment in February 2017. I was asked what had happened since my file was still in the system and I explained to them the situation. They told me that they would talk with the recruiter at the branch that I had first applied and would give me a call back. I was told that previous branch had tried to contact me, but I know that I did not receive any calls or any other forms of contact. I was then told to wait for a call back to see what the previous branch wanted to do if I should retake the tests, assessment, and fill out necessary paperwork. Unfortunately, I did not hear back from both branches. A total of 5 months was wasted. I was ready and willing to work. I had no planned vacation, appointments, or other priorities that might have disrupted my employment for the 6 month contract for the assignment.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I applied to Balance Staffing in Merced a few weeks ago, met with a recruiter by the name of Virdana. she offered me a job in Modesto, I took it because I really needed to work but she failed to explain what job entailed. it was an immediate position and I was not sure about it but then she said that if I didn't like it to call her and she would help me find something else. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for me. I contact her and let her know I was not going to continue, she appeared upset that I left the job. I told her I needed something local. she didn't seem to understand or didn't care what I was looking for to began with. After that, she was completely rude, saying maybe I need to learn how to understand and follow instructions. Since then shes rejected my calls. Don't waste your time going to Balance Staffing Folks, this person is completely illiterate and rude. I don't even know if shes even speaking English. She didn't even take the time to ask me what I was looking for  and what my experience was. This was a complete waste of time.

How funny, that Balance staffing has their Reviews filtered to where they won’t show any reviewd less than 4 stars. This truly deserves a negative star.<//text>

<text>All the staff employees from the front desk, recruiter and the employee inside the computer room helping clients with questions and concerns were for REAL and DEDICATED professional people. They were easy to talk with and really cared about the clients that visited their office. Special thanks to "Jose" for a possible job placement that might fit my skills and experience. I had a very excellent experience here at this Modesto branch the atmosphere was nice. I'm just happy to have visited this branch it was different.

The city where I'm from (Sto*****) they were nice during the application process,  BUT once its done. I tried calling the recruiters a week later and try to stay in touch with a certain position, job, etc. they were rude, i got lots of run around and never heard  of them since.<//text>< pics>

I never in my 53 years of professional experience worked with a temporary agency. My experience with Balance has been quite benificial and very rewarding. I am very pleased with their responsiveness and concern to my needs or questions. I would highly recommend them.

That was then, before my injury. I retract the above statement in its entirety. While working dealt with personal in San Jose, not a problem ever, after injury nobody can answer questions referred to safety team who is an invisible joke.<//review>

<Review>They don’t accommodate to people with disabilities. They never return your calls, in fact when I applied I don’t think they even tried to get me a job because I never heard from them after that. The whole situation was just weird and would not recommend. Probably easier to just apply at McDonald’s, the pay is the same.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Maria Ramero one of Balances A+ Recruiters is a go to individual who has a niche for finding you a job or kind that for you and your skills. She has assisted me for the past few years now with lift operator, warehouse, material handling, sanitation, and shipping opportunities. There are many great recruits located in the modesto branch yes these ladies are holding it down.</Text>

Can’t even get a hold of these people. Their number that pops up on google doesn’t even work and their website only gives you the option to contact their social media with no way to email them. Just wondering how you get clients when there’s no way to contact you???????<//text>

The office is very clean and organize. I want to thank Michelle Maltizo. She's very nice, respectful and she found me a job less than a week. So, thank you Michelle for your time and effort.< /Review>

Yes I agree with all the reviews.  They had me write a review upon hire, little did I know how incompetent they are.  even if you pass all their tests for employment, they don't call or return your calls about temp assignment or employment.  I'm sorry I ever signed up.<//text>

<review>After being laid off from my previous job, I came here and got an interview from them in a fast and timely manner. My recruiter Claudia got me back on my feet and I can't be thankful enough to express that to her. Hopefully you are reading this, thank you. Plus their staff were friendly as well.<//review>< Time>

<text>Very unprofessional company recruiter left half way through filling out all the paperwork then never returned messages, only way I could get the place to even answer the phone was to block my number, and if i did happen to get ahold of my recruiter she had no idea who I was or what work I was looking for company recruits and acts like they have work even when they have no work then gets irritated when you call asked what's going on. Seems like they're running some sort of scam like selling you personal info</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
This place was a bad experience for me. They sent me to a forklift job and the guy who was training me told me I was doing a great job for my first day on the job. I was looking forward to going back in the next nite to continue my training. But when I get home balance calls and tells me that my assignment has been cut due to work performance. I found this to be offensive considering I gave 110% at the job and my trainer told me I was doing good too. They said they would try to find me something else but haven't heard from them since.<//Review>

< Review>
My boyfriend applied and interviewed for a position, his recruiter repeatedly sent him txt msgs from her personal phone,asked to friend him on FB and even went as far to meet him at the job site after 1130pm to wish him good luck,promising him good pay, good hours...but at what cost??
She didn't care he has a girlfriend and made their business relationship uncomfortable for both of us...so ladies beware!  Very unprofessional!</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Balance Staffing placed me at Seneca Foods and my second day at work was my last! I was yelled at by Seneca suporvisors and was sent home for "not doing the job the right way," when it wasn't even explained  to me properly. Coincidently, I was the ONLY blonde haired blue eyed woman in the entire cannery practically, and was given dirty looks and treated unfairly! That's called DISCRIMINATION and is illegal last time I checked. I don't suggest anyone works through Balance Staffing or Seneca.< /Review>< pics>

< review>
They (BALANCE STAFFING) discriminate against people who actually want jobs and keep them. I went in there and it was filled with immigrants that didnt speak any english (ARE THEY SURE THESE PEOPLE ALL HAVE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS FOR WORK?). I dont discriminate against any race, but seemed like i was applying for a position in the fields. Very unprofessional place to apply for employment. Doesnt seem like they are of any help to anyone. Very disrepectful receptionists at the desk and the recruiters. They speak to you like you are stupid, dumb or ignorant. This place is a scam. They pay a low pay grade in an economy where we do have needs to survive such as family, children and the high bills we face in our everyday lives to provide for ourselves and our families and children. They terminate people and hire new candidates to replace the old ones because they dont want to pay the pay raise people are entitled to receive. Ive been there 5-6 times on follow ups on any recent employment positions and have had no success at all. I keep getting the run around about there are no positions available for any type of jobs. If there are no available positions through this company then why accept new candidates and lead them on with hopes of finding and obtaining employment? Thats what i was told by the receptionists at the front desk and the so called recruiters. I didnt bother to pay attention to any names because this place is a joke. Id rather go to another agency because this one is only helping out their own race. They said they will call again if ANY positions should open up. Worst palce ever.

ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS FOR EVERYONE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT... GO ELSEWHERE. THIS PLACE WILL BE THE WASTE OF YOUR TIME. SAYING THAT ANY JOB IS BETTER THEN NO JOB, BUT THERE ARE NO JOBS HERE AND YOU GET THE RUN AROUND WHICH ARE BASICALLY ALL LIES. MOTIVATED EMPLOYMENT SEEKERS, I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF US ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF A JOB AND THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO APPLY. TRY OUT OTHER STAFFING AGENCIES AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL FIND EMPLOYMENT WITH AN AGENCY THAT IS MORE UNDERSTANDING, COURTEOUS, RESPECTFUL AND HONEST. AN AGENCY THAT WILL GIVE YOU A CALL BACK AND NOT LIE TO YOUR FACE AND MAKE UP REASONS AND EXCUSES FOR NOT HAVING ANY TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT IN THEIR AGENCY. FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE??? GO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF AND SEE HOW MUCH OF A WASTED TIME AND HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE YOU WILL RECEIVE.

They don't even deserve 1 star. Their employees have no customer service skills at all, they never answer their phone, and to top it off, they didn't call me when it was time to start my assignment.
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

Never again will I go back to this place, one of the lady's that works there was really rude when I asked her a question she assumed I didn't know something  just because I didn't know the definition of a word, if I could give this place half a star I would!</review>

Fantastic food and great prices. We came on off hours, so there weren't many people and our order came very fast. They also served us each a small bowl of complimentary ice cream at the end. I will recommend this place.<//Review>

Very good price for enormous amount of food. Not saying the food quality is top (some sashimi weren't the freshest for example) on the market, but it's decent for the price, and again, amount of food, I can't seem to get over this. Def worth a try! Totally recommend!!!<//Text>

Good combo deals. Rolls were good too but ended up being average priced sushi restaurant. Staff was nice. I would come again because of the bento box deal. It's nice to share a roll and the bento box between two people.<//Review>

Value here is pretty good, especially if you get the 5 piece nigiri + 5 piece sashimi for $10. The service here is pretty awful though, it is both slow and disorganized.</review>

<text>Great food for a really decent price.  Love this place, it's like our second kitchen.  We're here almost every week.  You get a lot for your money.  You'll go home full without breaking your bank like other Japanese restaurants. The owner, Mr A, is friendly, very hands on- usually at the counter making rolls- and always makes us feel welcome.  We're very happy it's close to our house too.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The sushi here is above average. The biggest down fall to this place is the service. It is incredible slow. I have been here 3 times now and the sashimi is always the last item to come out. Why...? It's raw fish that just needs to be cut. Our rolls always comes out before sashimi. Also on our last visit one of the workers was arguing with the owner!< /text>

Interior is dim and not too noisy, self-seating anywhere on the day I ate there. Service was of no issue, but server was not helpful with questions on some sushi rolls. Miso soup and edamame given were complimentary, it seems. Food is good, shiitake rolls were especially flavorful. Strawberry ice cream given when finished.
Issues: server has no energy and brought down our mood. A tad bit rude when dealing with my friend.< /Text>

I visit A's Sushi often, the workers there are kind. My favorite is the bento which consists of terryaki, veggie tempura, California roll, rice, and one more item I think. After you get dessert.< /review>

Reasonably priced.  Miso soup, edamame, and ice cream served free of charge with my order. Sushi chef also gave me a sample of seared halibut and white tuna sashimi.  Very good fish and pictures of all rolls on menu which helps me decide.</text>

I rearly put out reviews for restaurants since I travel quite a bit, and have chance to sample all kind of food in USA, but this time I feel like I am obligated to write it due to their great service, fine tasty food, and wonderful price. We ordered bentons for various of 2 to 3 items, price from $9.99 to $12.99, and man! that came with lots of good tasty Japanese Style  food, from grilled Salmon and Saba, to Pork Katsu, to teriyaki chicken, California roll, to tuna sashimi..., It is the place for a quick and delicious meal, lunch or dinner.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The other restaurants in this shopping mall have been eaten, and this family has not tasted it yet. There are too many Japanese dishes nearby, and I usually go to a familiar restaurant to eat.

這購物中心的另外幾家餐廳都食過，就這家還没有試吃過。這附近日式料理太多，通常會去熟悉的餐廳吃飯。< /text>

Jimmy and his staff are absolutely amazing. As a guy going into a traditionally female atmosphere they always make me feel appreciated and welcome. I'm diabetic foot care is of the utmost importance, Pedi's aren't just for women anymore. Jimmy and his staff got you covered!</text>

The customer service is exceptional, and the quality of nails is amazing.  Robert went out of town and Lucy did my nails and I was just as happy. Everyone is so helpful.  Definite five star business</text>

<Text>Have been going to Jimmys for years. I like Robert because he does the dip which looks thinner and more natural. Yesterday I went in and had my nails done only. No pedicure. It cost me 75.00. I was shocked. I can’t afford this every five weeks. I’m on a fixed income. I may need to find another salon. Today. One day later one of my nails peeled and it was very sticky underneath. Not sure what caused this. I will be calling them tomorrow. Very disappointed< /Text>< Response>

< Review>
Very pleasant but today on WED APRIL 24TH (( I was not Happy )) with the service this Lady gave me. ■ After going there for 4 years Straight & Always Supporting one of their employee gave me a bad pedicure & Pretty much she wasn't trying to Listen to anything i have to say. At the end I Complained but I Felt like it was a Waste of my Time. It's kinda Sad that after 4 Years I may start Looking for another place & Honestly speaking won't refer Anyone over there.</Review>

<user>114895746667761411291<//user><Text>Nice looking nail spa. Me and my friend wanted a pedicure and I also needed my eyebrows done. The wait for the pedi was way too long, understandable because I didn’t have an appointment. However, they got me in in 20 minutes for my eyebrows! And I liked it. Very clean touch up!</Text>< date>

<Text>I showed up ready to spend money. It was one minute to closing. I wanted a Mani pedi. They sent me away. I found another salon .3 miles away that was happy to take my business. One tip I would give nails by Jimmy is no handwritten signs tapped to your front door.  It's not inviting for the customer.< /Text>< Rating>

Sorry, we couldn’t take you today because it was late for us. All my staff and I are all have young children at home that we like to get home to. Well you know...you have kids too.

Had my nails done by Houng today and he was awesome. After 15 years of going to a different salon I will now be switching to Jimmy’s. He took his time and made sure each of my nails were perfect.</review>

It's been less than a week and the polish is chipped and looks awful. She also did not do a good job on filing my nails.

< Review>
Never had a particularly great experience here. Pretty standard. But I came out of there with a toe fungus that hasn’t gone away in years even after medication.. My mom warts on her feet that haven’t gone away even after treatments. I’ve witnessed improper cleaning techniques or complete lack in general. I will never go back and I would caution against others going as well.</Review>

Highly recommend this bakery! The staff and baker are super nice! Custom ordered a cake for my parter’s birthday and it was great! Can you guess what it was from the photos? 😉</review>

Trusted and reliable. Always open early. The breakfast bolillos are the best. They have a taco truck each night and they do street tacos that are delish< /text>

Don't let the location drive you away from this gem. The area seems a bit sketchy but man is it worth it. The bakery itself has some of the best pastries I have ever tasted, not over sweet or over produced.

At night there is a taco truck out front which toes just T.J. style tacos. I had the chorizo, adobado, and asada,  each were juicy flavorful and filling. You get your money's worth at this place.</review>

Amazing place for quality Mexican breads and Mexican dishes. They even have cake and so many options in the Bakery 😍👍  I’ve been coming here for years and recently moved, now driving the extra miles all the way back to Su Pan bakery to get my fix.<//text>

<Review>This place sells more than just fresh bread. Here you can get tortas and smoothies, even chilaquiles. The pastries are great, the bolillos stuffed with cheese or with ham are great, you can even get chocolate covered strawberries. There’s something in the store for everyone. On weekends, I recommend calling in ahead for any food as that is their most popular hours.<//Review>< Pics>

They make great sheet cakes and have very tasty cream danishes. I come from a culinary background so I know a thing or two about pastries. This bakery knocks everything out of the park!</Text>

<Review>Stopped in after completing 3 of the 5 Peak Challenge (hiking). Had a hankering for a Carne Asada Torta and a diet coke as a reward for myself. They have to supporting condiments of delisciousness sauces, one green, one red, alternating sauces in effect! I also purchased a pastry which they have many! Some kind of magical half cheese half raspberry jam/jelly Danish. What in Tarnation is this magical treats??
Come on down for great chow!< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOClQwv8EO41RL14HOd82IWAp5AXogUe-i8IME2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQMe77Md5_yl1gwnLu9iG6TOrlKieRGf2IVIU5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80d95423ebbaa857:0xb6f15c12dea1f5fc< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
This place gets all 5 stars for the great food, coffee, and you cant leave without getting some pan. They also have cheesecake and smoothies. Everything is good. We came to try thier tortas and they surpassed expectations. We had the torta chilanga and torta cubana. Full of flavor from your ordinary torta. Highly recommend it. It comes with a side of fries. Plus they serve Cafe de Olla!!! If you dont know, now you know. Come and try it. The bread is always great and fresh. Plus you always want to have pan at home to satisfy that sweet tooth. We always come here for pan but will .wake sure to get a torta as well. The service is great as well and  nice ppl.</Review>

The best Mexican bakery and breakfast place in SD. If you want something authentic, tasty, and a great value this is the place. All bread and tortillas are made in house and absolutely delicious.< /Text>

Amazing family staff. Super friendly and always serving samples preventing them from wasting a lot of food. Really clean and love all the pastries and lot of foot traffic in the morning but there are many people also working in the morning so it’s a quick and easy place to get a coffee and pastry under 3 minutes!! They also have great cakes, even though I haven’t tried a whole slice I have tried the sample and it is delicious!!<//Review>

<Review>I needed to order a cake for my friends baby shower. I went a few days before, and the baker and staff were so nice and helpful. She helped me decide on how big of a cake was needed for about 25 people. I sent her pictures of some cake ideas, ended up choosing buttercream frosting with piped vines, and inside vanilla cake with strawberries. It was ready for me to pick up by 10am, it turned out perfect, plus it tasted so good!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<name>Jennifer Gomez< /name><date>1564865562763< /date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>I went and ordered a cake, spent like 2 hrs there choosing the decorations, size and making sure the lady was able to make the cake. When it was time to pick up the cake they gave me a plain simple cake that they keep in the fridge in the front they just wrote happy birthday on it! I was very disappointed. They offered me the money back from the decorations but wanted to charge me full price for the plain cake 25 dollars with the words happy birthday! There buttercream frosting is not good at all. This place is a Joke. If they couldn't have it done on time or at all they should of called and let us know so we were able to find somewhere else.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The lovely people who work here are always kind, warm, welcoming, and, full of laughter. They are through and helpful in making sure that the product your looking for is what you receive. If they are sold out of your usual choice they make whole hearted recommendations to new products. I've never had a disappointing interaction or purchase at Su Pan. Every meal exceeds my expectations.  Every time I come here I wish I bought more before I left!!! My favorite breakfast spot and panaderia hands down.

Service is so-so.
Waited in line while cashiers counted their cash. Never before been to a store where both registers counted cash while customers were waiting. We also had to clean our own table.

Good selection of sweet delights and everything looks good.
We had the Tres Leches (vanilla). Ours was a little too moist and the bottom consisted of a thin chocolate crust which I think detracted from the overall flavour. It was okay but there are better to be found in San Diego. Barra Barra Saloon in Old Towne (San Diego) is better.

Better yet,  make the 7 hour drive to Seaside, CA., and have the absolute best Tres Leches in California at La Tortuga Restaurant. Yeah, I know, it's a long drive. Do you want the best or don't you?</text>

We came here because it said online that this was the best Tres Leches in San Diego! I can honestly say that this is absolutely untrue. Hell, this was one of the worst Tres Leches we've ever had. Dry, boring, had very little moisture from milk. Safeway has better Tres Leches! Do not come to this seemingly sketchy part of El Cajon for this abomination in the name of Tres Leches!<//review>

< review>
The best panaderia in this part of town. The cakes...just drool over the awesome selection while you're there. My favorite right now are the chilaquiles with green sauce. The best I've had in San Diego in 20 years. They have a nice modern cash register I'm pretty sure takes Apple Pay and that kind of payments. Usually pretty clean inside, and there's always people sitting down eating. Parking can be tight but it's worth it. Good good good and pan dulce.<//review>

<text>This is my torta spot. I never get anything else except for the supreme torta, it has everything I want on it. Although there are a few cooks in the back, only one person I know in there makes it the best. I don't know her name but I know who she is. Besides tortas, I like a little desert with one of the many pastries to choose from.<//text><Name>Claudio Cruz<//Name><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

I made an order by phone about 15 minutes before after I got there I wait like 5 minutes making a line to pay and it turns out that they did not place my order just the cashier was still writing it on a paper and they tell me that if I wanted to order what I still had to wait  about 15 more minutes until the orders of others passed that bad service< /text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad customer service! Seem to bother when asked about the answer very rude manner and rue menu were two people behind the counter and were talking among them without being very attentive to my order and it's a shame because we like the food here.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio al cliente! Pareciera que se molestan cuando les preguntan sobre el menú contestan de manera muy grosera y ruda estaban dos personas tras el mostrador y estaban platicando entre ellas sin ser muy atentas hacia mi orden y es una lástima porque nos gusta la comida de aquí.<//Review>
