Staff at emergency were so rude. You can help people without being rude or giving nasty comments or putting people down. They need people skills. Some professionalism and common courtesy from staff would be nice. I guess Sierra view doesn’t hold their staff to any certain standards when dealing with the public. God bless them because they need it. And God bless all the people that got to deal with ugly staff.< /Text>

Went to the ER and I'm completely satisfied with their help the nurse was so nice and showed she really cares. They made me feel so comfortable and glad I came here . Wayyyy better than kaweah delta. Kaweah delta doesn't give a s*** if you're feeling ill just sorry feel better but sierra view went above and beyond.</review>

Would be 5 stars but staff violated HIPPA during my wife's stay. Her status was coming from every direction except from the one person that had legal authorization to be updated. Me her husband. Talked to them over and over. I am being ignored hoping it will go away. I need a HIPPA attorney< /Text>

<Text>I came here because of severe abdominal pain, waited more than 6 hours for the results. I could’ve gone to a professional hospital in LA and this hospital still wouldn’t have given me my results. I also talked with a guy who came to the same ER in fear of being in the midst of a whole HEART ATTACK and he’s been waiting even longer than I have. Highly suggest going anywhere but here. You could probably die and still be waiting on your results.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80eab81490f93cbb:0x5f89e7a805be3065<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If you want to wait 2-3 hours in the ER waiting room and for them just to send you home (and going to another hospital and they keep you) this would be a good place to go too. Horrible Place better off going to another hospital. Just in it for the $.</text>

Honestly Idk why this hospital has so many bad reviews...I guess it depends on the day u go if they are in a bad mood or good mood...The times that I had gone to the ER for myself and my daughter we have been treated very good...Also in the delivery section floor the nurses are always nice to me...I had great experience with both my baby deliveries...And now yesterday 11/23/20 I had surgery and I was treated great by all the staff...Or maybe they look rude or sound rude if u the patient talk back to them...But I had had great visit experiences...< /Text>

<review>My sister brought me to the ER us both thinking that even though I was feeling awful that it wasn't life threatening,  but I was taken to the back after a short wait and after my EKG things happened FAST. I was having a heart attack and everyone that helped me was fantastic,  they got me hooked up and ready for the ambulance in what seemed like seconds, I'm very thankful for them all, otherwise I'm sure I wouldn't be here now.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I was at the emergency room for three hours for kidney stones. They did blood work and still had like eleven patients ahead of me. Had to drive to Delano hospital for treatment with "that pain" which took another hour. I never received treatment or results from my blood work yet I still had to pay. A rep calls me to make payment arrangements and never sends the bill. I just received a collection statement requesting full payment. I have no words for this experience. One star is too much.<//Review>

<Text>I would give this establishment a no-star review if I could. The amount of women I personally know that have either actually DIED or suffered life-threatening symptoms after delivering their children here is outrageous and tragic. The labor/delivery nurses are completely at fault due to their delinquency. It is common for nurses at this hospital to leave gauze and other surgical objects inside of their patients after a surgery (e.g. all the women I knew that delivered here had gauze left inside of them and suffered infections and one actually lost her life). And to top all of this inadequacy off, the doctors/hospital affiliates (when informed of these issues) ride them off by stating that "nurses get confused/busy and can mess up, it is not a big deal". I suggest anyone interested in delivering their child here take heed of this warning and find yourself a decent hospital. I have no idea why the nurses at this establishment are so unorganized and lazy (like come on did they not learn the most basic rule that one should always take count of your surgical equipment prior to and after a surgical procedure in order to avoid leaving something inside the patient). I just wish that the hospital would uphold better standards/protocol when hiring/training their nurse staff. I get that it is very common to call out the "nurse" for being "half-witted" but I am sincerely concerned at the lack of care these individuals carry for their line of work. Seems like all they care about is a paycheck and the hospital simply cares about not getting sued. I would never try to demean the hard work that comes along with these medical jobs, but I truly do not think that they care about what they do and that is pathetic. Just because the patient does not fully understand their rights, does not mean one should take advantage of that. Shame on any of the employees that have taken part of or have been passive to these issues.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1565279633310, 'text': 'Jennifer, thank you for taking the time to share your concerns about these unacceptable practices that do not follow our hospital standards.

This hospital has no regard to you as a patient.. your time doesn't mean anything to them... if you go to the e.r. forget about having a life and having things to do.. they take hours and hours to get results back to you.. they don't care how long they are taking they're being paid hourly to be there..mean while you've been down there for hours not feeling good and starving to death by the time they're done with you..its ridiculous and rude..</Review>

<text>Went in to ER with symptoms of a stroke. Waited over 5 hours to get a room. The only reason I’m giving 1 star is for the first Doctor I seen. I don’t know his name, but he immediately ordered tests, showed a tremendous amount of concern did an excellent neuro exam and admitted me for further evaluation.  After he went off duty the physician (if you want to call him that) came in, asked what happened and as soon as I started talking he turned and walked out saying he was going to find me a bed. I had to spend the entire night on a gurney in the ER and the entire next day. It took over an hour each time I pushed my call light for help until a night shift nurse named Michael (a traveler) came in and was right there for me whenever I needed anything. They moved me to telemetry that  evening after change of shift.
I got so many different answers from staff that after 3 days we left completely confused. Too much detail to go into. Just wanted to basically say. I will NEVER go back there again.</text>< user>

<Review>Came in to the ER after a self-inflicted suicide attempt the day before, to ask for a mental evaluation, waited around an hour and a half to speak to an assigned nurse (not the staff that did basic heart rate tests and allergy questions) and another hour and a half hour later to see an actual doctor-- I interrupted Dr. Safarian when I was upset and wanted to leave by that point because I didn't feel the clinic was appropriate, and then he threatened to withhold me "involuntarily for days" if I interrupted him again. Which I did, when I reacted in disbelief and asked "are you threatening me?" and I was kept there for several hours until they got fed up with me asking if what they were doing is legal or not. The doctor's first inclination was to order me not to interrupt him again because I was upset, and then move to forcibly keep me in the hospital "for days" without outside contact.

The nurse that was assigned to me kept saying he'd get my clothes, but after the fourth time asking I peaked out the doorway and saw him having a casual chat with a receptionist. On top of negligence he was just flat out lying to my face, 20 ft away.

At one point they took away the phone I asked for and refused to return it, denying my family who were waiting in the ER and only 'allowed' me to leave after coming VOLUNTARILY, if I saw the same doctor who threatened me to 'clear' me to leave. Awful place. Awful people. The only positive to that day was the crisis worker they had to bring in, which gave me a list of mental health clinics to go to for a mental health evaluation and a contact number to lodge a complain. I went the same day to the clinic.

I hate the fact that my grandfather is currently sick in this same hospital and has to stay there.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1565802482131, 'text': 'Hi there, we are glad that you voluntarily came to our hospital.

They maybe deserve half a star.... that should be an option.  The nurses are unwelcoming,  stand offish, and seemingly disinterested in patient care.  They act as if requesting help or information is a major imposition on their time.  Personal conversations prioritized over patients. There seems to be only ONE dr. to oversee patients.  WOW. I keep reading horrible review after horrible review spanning back months.  How embarrassing. Please don't direct me to call a patient care line because it clearly is as ineffective as the staff.<//text>

<Review>As a former employee of 26 years at Sierra View District Hospital I have a lot to say about the hospital. We had some great leaders there through out the years. It all stopped when they merged with the Lindsay hospital. Alot of my staff where let go do to less seniority. I was given a hit list to get rid of some of my employees from the Administrator and my Director at the time who where from Lindsay. I refused to do this so i was brought in and demoted and was offered less than half of my current pay. I would be making less than the new employees hired after my 26 years of service. I am very glad to see they are no longer there. I worked with the Doctors and Nurses for 26 years, they where all great, i could not ask for better. I was heart broke to leave my staff and friends with no notice. I thank God they have better leadership now. My advice to them is take care of your loyal staff, they are hard to come by. I have relocated to Oregon since leaving, and I am working in the Mental Heath field, this is my true calling. In closing i believe they had to hire 3 people to replace me.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Our family first time experiencing a family member stay in Porterville Hospital and I must say we really loved how the staff treated my Mom and all the family members that went to see and stayed there with her. The nurses are so friendly always offering coffee to us every morning and there was no limit of people that could be in the room and no time limit. The only bad thing was the EMERGENCY Room we lasted 9 hours before they finally said that they where going to admit my mother but other then that her say was very well.< /review>

Came in with my mom because she had a severe stomach pain and wouldn't stop throwing up. Sierra View hospital helped her out a lot and she is making a good recovery now :) The nurses were very nice to us and kept checking up.</review>

<Review>I had surgery at this hospital this past week. I will say I was very skeptical and worried because of all the reviews I’ve read.

But I’ll tell you this, the PreOp RN Manuela was wonderful - she got my IV in with one stick (which is a big deal) & was very friendly, the CNA was very nice as well and oriented me to the room and what I needed to do.

The circulating nurse Julie was very comforting and explained to me exactly what was about to happen. I was able to carry personal conversation which not all nurses do.

The anesthesiologist Dr. Dillol (not sure if I’m spelling it right) was wonderful, I expressed my worries to him and how I was trusting him basically with my life and he made sure to comfort me and inform me very well to the point where I trusted him. He was very patient with me and my concerns, I also received a call from him the day after to see how I was doing.

Dr. Reader, my ENT specialist & surgeon did a great job from my first office visit to now that I am 1 week postop without any complications.

I’m not sure how every unit in this hospital is, but my experience here was great. Thank you.< /Review>< pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>came in for emergency treatment for my husbands life threatening condition after being shown to a hallway bed seen by a p.a. My husbands while suffering with chills and fatigue. Was set upon by nurse phillip who upon seeing me and my husband homeless situation demanded him to get up immediately to move to another room . seeing that he needed assistance didnt offer any nurse phillip threatened to call security even after my husband informed him that he was weak and needed a minute then told us he had one minute to move before he called security. My husband nearly fainted in his rush to switch rooms. Thank god he didnt. Just because we are homeless we were treated like animals instead of humans. We were embarrassed and frightened. By far the worse emergency room and hospital ever.< /review>< Resp>

I went to get stat mammo and breast ultrasound. There is a lump and I have a long family history of breast cancer. It's been days and the rad still hasn't read the study. This hospital is the worst when it comes to patient care. They should seriously be investigated.</review>

I would never recommend going to the ER here! Apparently they have only one doctor so we have waited over 3 hours and still have not seen a doctor! With the amount of people that go to the ER in this town you would think that they could afford to have more than one doctor!! I should have driven to Visalia Hospital!!!</text>

I would give no star if I was allowed to but I have to give one in order to write a review. I have never been to this hospital but it is a nightmare. The registered nurse is rude along with the old lady who accompanies her. It is as if there is nobody else in that backroom that can help besides that one RN in the front. I left as soon as I saw how rude they were being and how long the wait would be. There were people who had been in car accidents sitting and waiting for two hours. This place NEEDS to be shut down.< /text>

<review>Worst hospital trip ever.
Not a single member of the staff even acted like they cared about what was going on. I had to ask for a blanket 5 times before finally getting one. The doctor ignored everything he was told, then disappeared for the remainder of my visit. The nurse went on her lunch without saying a word. I've never experienced such incompetent apathy from a team of medical professionals.

Bottom line: Take the time to go to another hospital. It just might save your life.< /review>< date>

<Text>This hospital is the worst ! My dad final days of life the nurses and cnas on the third floor left my poor father laying in his poop and pee for longer than an hour. Took me several times just to have someone come change him well the cnas and nurses were laughing and talking all loud about things outside work. On top of that when I approach them they talked very rudely towards me saying I never called them when I did through the nurse call button  which took them another 30 minutes more just so my dad could get changed. And on top of that I told my dad’s RN he needed to be changed. No one came until I started saying this would NEVER HAPPEN IN VISALIA. This is the worst hospital to go too. I wish I could give no stars at all. I wish my poor dad final days in that disgusting hospital weren’t spent like this. Left him sitting on his butt for three days straight they never  bothered to turn him. And gave him a bad open butt sore. Worst experience me and my family went through well my dad was waiting to be sent home for hospice care. !<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1567103687915, 'text': 'Anna, this is not how we want our patients to be treated and we are sorry that you and your father had a horrible experience at our hospital.

My personal experience with this hospital has been a "mixed bag"; both good and poor.
The main complaint is the ER, which has overall good, caring nurses but DREADFUL doctors!
There is a woeful lack of ER beds available, resulting in far too many seriously ill patients having to recline on chairs pushed together, rather than getting a bed...or even a gurney.

However, the main hospital is well run and efficient and-unlike the ER-has caring, conscientious doctors.
I received overall good quality care each time I was admitted for surgical procedures and overnight-or longer-stays.< /Text>

< Review>
Horrible Emergency Room, took my mom last night at 6pm. She had been throwing up for 2 weeks straight and lost 7lbs she looked so pale and could barely stand I didn't want to wait till next week for her appointment with her oncologist so I decided to take her. We were in the waiting room for 2+hrs  Then were finally called to a room at 9pm. They just hooked her up to the monitor and no one came back in at all till 1230am. I finally got frustrated and went to tell the nurse that she just wanted to go home  The nurse said "okay then" and just walked away.  20min later the doctor came in asking what was going on, he was sooo rude  it was unbelievable he wouldn't even let her finish her answers. Instead of her feeling relieved that a dr was finally there she felt worse. We told the nurse we want to leave now we're not waiting for the dr to come back if he ever does decide too. I get that its busy but why not have more doctors there. There was only 1 rude doctor working. It's my fault for giving them a 2nd chance, it would have been a lot better to make the drive out to Visalia.  She goes to Roger S. Good cancer center there at Sierra View and they are amazing I have no idea why the ER is completely different.. would give this negative stars if possible.<//Review>

Treated there many times over the years and been happy.  Kinda bothers me though why people go to KDH in Visalia instead.  Layoffs few years ago and I think it made a big difference in employee morale as a whole.  Treat staff great and they will treat patients better and in turn have more patients and therefore,  better profit margin and client loyalty!< /Review>

Horribly slow process in the ER compared to other prominent hospitals that actually stands by their commitment of excellence when it comes to urgency and patient care I say this because I’ve sadly known a patient that passed from waiting too long in this ER.as director Shay Moore should really re-evaluate and step up her protocol.</text>

Chris Seitz P.A provided thorough information to not only my physician but also to me as the patient.

I have seen the E.R. Techs and nurses provide some of the most optimal care.  They care about their patients.

Keep up the great work.</text><user>109382797287171169084< /user>< Pics>

I think that some of us tend to only comment or write a review when we are angry, and yes the place gets packed but only because other people do have health problems too. The staff has always been so nice and really made me feel like they cared! In and out in 30minutes!</Text>

<text>This is by far the worst hospital. Especially labor/ delivery I was scheduled to be induced and it’s been a few days that they just keep giving me the run arounds. And to top it off I’m in so much pain but since I’m not dilated enough they can’t keep me. I’m past my due date so I just change hospitals and I’m going to deliver in Visalia this hospital doesn’t care about anyone especially the nurses in labor/delivery!</text>< pics>

<review>This hospital should be shut down or get better employees!!! I got there at 1:00am & end up leaving at 4:50am without being seen. I find it very unprofessional that the employees that were there all they did was be on their phones & talk about the patients. Then to top it off they too busy not paying attention they overdose a patient & were talking about it like it wasn't nothing. I recommend everyone to just go to Visalia hospital instead of Porterville!!! Be safe & go to a place that know what they are doing instead of going to Porterville & u just might end up dead!!!!</review>< pics>

The doctor didn't run any tests on my son when he came in there with his right side hurting. then gave him pain pills and told him he was free to go. He is still there. I called and told them he cant walk and can hardly talk cause the pain is so bad. he don't need pain pills he needs to know what is wrong , what is causing the pain. Some doctor they have huh. I told him to tell the dr to run tests so that he knows what is wrong.<//text>

<Review>If there were a way to give it negative stars, I would. If I were in need of dire medical attention and had the choice between being taken here or just left to die, I would choose being left to die. I feel I would have a greater likelihood of survival being left to die than being taken there for treatment. I wouldn't put it past this facility to have someone brought in for a broken leg and they end up removing both kidneys and sending the patient home with no kidneys and an untreated broken leg. This may sound ridiculous and far fetched, but ask yourself, "is it worth the risk to go here or is there anyway I can get to another hospital?"</Review>< Gmap_id>

My father had a very bad experience while in the hospital.  Our family decided that it was necessary for a family member to be with him at all times so that they wouldn' t mistreat him.  Very sad!  No one should be mistreated--especially when they are sick.</Review>

<text>NO THANKS

Never had been here till last week  but I came here after a whole 24 hours of not being able to hold down anything, severe abdominal pain, high fever, etc. finally after an hour of waiting and throwing up still in the waiting area, the Dr came by for 2 mins and said you will have to go to the other side because you need an IV, so after sending me out (still throwing up in the blue bags they give) I waited a whole 2 hours to be called to the other side and they put me on a bed in the hall! After sitting on the bed for over an hour the Dr on that side told me i was not feeling well because of my period and that there was NOTHING wrong with me! Y'all I was so mad, so dehydrated and still throwing up I just walked out. How can this "Dr" tell me I don't feel good from my period?? I have a surgery scheduled in 2 weeks and I am so scared and nevrvous to do it at this hospital. If the ER staff are that uncaring, boy am I in for a big surprise!< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80eab81490f93cbb:0x5f89e7a805be3065</Gmap_id></record>

There is a reason why this place went from HOSPITAL to MEDICAL CENTER and it can't be for any good reason's right. Well after multiple bad experiences here if we need urgent care we go to Visalia and if it was for the kids we went to the children's hospital up north. I can go off an multiple near death experience from friends and family members but only know of 1 good experience and that was with me in 2008 and that's the reason for 2 stars and not just 1. Well you are more then welcome to come in for your self and create your own experience if you haven't yet. Lol<//review>

<Review>Sorry but my mom always told me I'd you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all. For this one time in going against my mom's suggestion. The emergency room is horrible. My sister in law was in the emergency room for over 7 and half hours waiting to be admitted into the hospital. She actually saw 2 Dr's, andthey both had different opinions. I really felt the Dr's were very incompetent. I'm sorry to have to leave a review like this because this is the hospital in my own town and we have no other options except to drive to Visalia over 30 miles away. All this money they're putting into this emergency room/Hospital has no made it even a little better.</Review>< Pictures>

Hospitals should have high standards. One thing wrong ruins the experience cause well its your or your loved ones life on the line. Ive seen sick contagious people on the same floor as people being wheeled in for surgery. Long waits to see anybody. Me and my girl had our baby here and i been here for 24 hours and counting and they have refused to give me food so i have to leave my girls everytime i get hungry and that gets expensive and makes me feel like im not there for them as much as i should be. And one night we went to see our baby in the nursery and no nurses were at the station. One fonally showed up and we asked her to help us get in cause we needed to feed our baby and she grabbed her paperwork that was unrelated to what we were doing and ignored us after talking to us. We had to wait for 2 more nurses to show up before one of them let us in. Its a shame cause there are some nice people here but a few bad things ruins the entire experience cause well its a hospital and we should expect the best from somthing thats supposed to save lives<//Review>

<Text>The OB / Labor Floor was great while i had went into labor and finally got sent from the ER . While i was giving labor my sons Dr.Lisa Garbner she was great. They worked as team and it went fast . Now being discharged took sooo long. But the ER experience was horrible . Extremly worried my son at 2 months got a high fever of 101.4 and has went has as 102.1 extremly dangerous for an infant. As we wait...... for what flt like 2 hours my son kept jerking and shaking.i had thought  he was going in to shock. So i ean to get a nurse. And it tokk almost 10 min . For her to find the doc. And as he checked my son and what i mean is just looked him over and felt his temp he said okay.... now tell me why u are cryjng.... and i said what ? Why i am crying ? What do u mean ? Look at him why does he kepp doing that (as he crys so much he cant evn brethe. ) he says what do u mean hes a baby hes guna cry.  And i tolf him no he dont cry l ike that there gots be something wrong. Thwy just smerkdd and asked me .. os this ur first baby. ? I repky yes. And he smiled and said okay ill just send my nurse to get blood and  and urine sample  with took them over 3 times to gwt the neddle in because the nurse didnt seem to have a clue or was pre pared .

Hospitals should have high standards. One thing wrong ruins the experience cause well its your or your loved ones life on the line. Ive seen sick contagious people on the same floor as people being wheeled in for surgery. Long waits to see anybody. Me and my girl had our baby here and i been here for 24 hours and counting and they have refused to give me food so i have to leave my girls everytime i get hungry and that gets expensive and makes me feel like im not there for them as much as i should be. And one night we went to see our baby in the nursery and no nurses were at the station. One fonally showed up and we asked her to help us get in cause we needed to feed our baby and she grabbed her paperwork that was unrelated to what we were doing and ignored us after talking to us. We had to wait for 2 more nurses to show up before one of them let us in. Its a shame cause there are some nice people here but a few bad things ruins the entire experience cause well its a hospital and we should expect the best from somthing thats supposed to save lives<//Text>

I recently had to go to ER.  I couldn't talk but was aware of everything.  The doctor was RUDE!  To say the nurse & phlebotomist were BAD would be a step up.  They couldn't get any blood so they stuck me >25 times including feet, neck, back...  I had the bruises for 2 weeks to remind me!   The urine sample was worse but I won't go into that.  There is 1 wonderful nurse that kept checking up on me but I wasn't lucky enough  for him to be my nurse.   After it was all said & done, they sent my CONFIDENTIAL (HIPA LAW!) records to 2 doctors' offices without my consent!
A couple years ago my husband was admitted to SVDH for 5 days.  They were "waiting for a consult from Stanford" (really? Stanford made you wait 5 days???) and forgot to give him the prescribed medicine after the first day.  I begged them to send him to Fresno or Stanford but they refused. Finally they released him  at 8 PM on the 5th day.  He was back in ER 6 hours later.  THANKFULLY that ER doctor recognized the true emergency & personally handled the transfer, by ambulance, to Fresno where he underwent emergency surgery.   That neuro-surgeon  said my husband should have been dead or a vegetable due to how serious he was.  Thank God for miracles & watching over him!
I DID have a good expedience in the OB department when I delivered my baby (13 years ago! )The nurses & doctors in the Labor & delivery ward are WONDERFUL.  Many are still there 13 years later.   Still its not appropriate to give an extra ☆. I'd write a separate review and give it ☆☆☆☆ but that wouldn't be a true reflection of the hospital as a whole.  SVDH needs CHANGE!   Maybe they need to NOT have 4/5 board members be doctors!!< /review><rate>1< /rate>< time>

The staff is rude and incompetent. I always heard horror stories but I gave them the benefit of doubt and that’s where I went wrong. This is by far one of the worst places I’ve been.< /Review>

<Review>LOVE this place! I went to two different shops one day after searching online for my next artist. Striking out twice not liking the artists I talked to I was feeling defeated when I drove past this little brick tattoo shop. I said what the hell let’s see what they got.. went in and was greeted by the owner. I looked through the books and couldn’t decide! They were all great! But I picked the man that greeted me. I could tell he had talent even though the style I wanted wasn’t his usual style I knew he would kill it and he did! I couldn’t be happier with my first one and going back for more!!<//Review>< Time>

Been going to Jace for years, about 18 years now.  His color is phenomenal!   Zero scaring,  a very light hand and his work stands the test of time.   Super clean environment!  He did my sleeve recently and free handed the whole thing and it looks absolutely great... the rest of the artist are very professional,  funny and all around good vibe in the shop.  I really cant say enough good things about this shop.  I have taken both my daughters to get their tattoos and they wont go anywhere else.< /Text>

<review>Jace, the owner of Brickhouse, has been tattooing me for a little over a year now. Every piece I've ever gotten from him is beautiful and each one he helps design to suit me uniquely. He has created such a welcoming atmosphere in this little shop and has a wonderful team of artists. This would be the perfect place for someone's first tattoo as every artist in the shop is very talented and kind. Once you go Brickhouse, you won't go back :)</review>< pics>

<Review>Highly recommend! The shop itself just has a nice feel to it as soon as you walk through the door, it’s very clean. The artist I went to was Ryan (ig: babywillcry) I loved my tattoo, he drew it himself as well as a tattoo he had done for my friend a while back which I think says a lot, I personally really like how it’s not just a copy paste type of deal here, and I’m definitely sticking to his work and this shop for my next pieces!</Review>< UserId.>

Always friendly staff. Super burrito is HUGE for 9.75!?! Tomatillio Asado salsa has just the right amount of spice and amazing layers of flavor. So glad they are my neighborhood joint.</text>

Terrible  customer  service, i needed  a moneygram  and the lady didn't  want to help me because  the name on my id, didn't  match  the name on my account, i told  her i got married  and  i had my married  certificate w me, but she just  act ignorant  to the fact and tell me to leave. So freaking  rude.  No buelvo  a este lugar.   Despidan a esa inepta.  Del turno de lunes por la tarde.<//review>

Totally different approach in costume business, price and variety is good specially one day after Halloween 🎃 they offer 50% off on all stuff at second day.
Must of good items would be gone by that day or even days prior to Halloween.
Need to pay a visit in advance, also they have good parking lot in back of the building</Review>

it's insanely huge and literally had every novelty ANYTHING you could ever want. only thing is that everything is pretty expensive, but there are a few good deals on certain items. just gotta look for em!... which is pretty entertaining in a store like this.</Text>

It's gone down. They need an upgrade on costumes. Same thing year after year. And you can tell if you're a late costume  shopper like myself the leftover costumes were the same leftover costumes from last year. I was eager to look for a costume for my little ones when I came in I instantly became uninterested nothing new, I left empty handed. They had a sale going on but nothing worth buying.< /Text>

This store reminds me a little of Party City and a Halloween store.  They also have sports shirts for different teams and countries.  Overall, I think it's a unique store and that's a good thing.< /Text>

<Review>This store is closing permanently. Everything is 50% off, but it's mostly junk now. About half the store is gutted already. They're even selling off the manequins, fixtures, mirrors, and wall panels. Sad to see you go! :(<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Aahs! has been around forever and is filled with tons of fun gifts. I went here for a Christmas party where we were doing a White Elephant gift exchange.

They had a 90% rack that was filled with Duck Dynasty stuff. I was able to buy $200 worth of  stuff for only $20. It was a huge hit at the party and was a great experience.

Friendly staff and good prices. Check it out if you need something small or random for a friend.</Review>

They took away my backpack and said we dont allow bags or pack packs. Even tho there were tons of people with back packs and bags. So I felt judge as a criminal. We left as soon as we realized it.<//review>

A lovely new place that excels in all areas. You're instantly immersed in a clean, modern ambiance and greeted by ardent hosts. I'm big on simple menus with each dish being exemplary which this restaurant really comes through on. A personal favorite is the Szechuan style chicken with chili sauce, you won't regret it. The Dan Dan Noodle is also quite spectacular with a striking balance between spicy, sweet, and just overall full of flavor.  If you're looking for a lighter dish, the Greenland Halibut is very fresh and incredibly tender. It's not the busiest place as of now, but I can definitely see it growing into a local hotspot. Oh, and best of all are the low prices for the quality you're getting. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!< /Review>

This place doesn’t get one star  pork wasn’t cooked in the soup, the containers broke in the bag, the only good thing was the fortune cookies because that was pre-made. The health department needs to walk in there today.
Not to-mention that there was a piece of glass/rock in the soup!<//text>

<review>Good Food at affordable prices. My favorite is the mandarin chicken and garlic sauce chicken, you have to try it! I've been coming her for 10+ yrs, this place never fails. Parking is a bit tough, but I don't mind walking.< /review>< Rating>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Perfect for satisfying your Chinese food cravings, especially after a night out! Sam Wo is open until very late in the night so it's perfect for those wanting a bite after bar hopping before heading home. The space is a little cramped and very no-nonsense, with some seating downstairs for smaller groups and more seating upstairs for bigger groups. They were able to accommodate several groups of 7 or more upstairs, though there was a 10-15 minute wait and we were pretty squished together. There's also a free photobooth type thing right outside the restaurant that your group can play with while waiting to be seated! Service is very no-frills, fast and efficient. There's only one bathroom downstairs, and there's often a line for it.< /review>< rate>

Came here with some friends and ordered a bunch of stuff - 3 orders of XLB, 2 types of pan fried pot stickers, siu mai and dry fried green beans. Everything was really good! 10 XLB for $10 is a good value - places in my hood charge $10 for 3 which makes me really sad.<//text>

Solid for quick deliver! We ordered general chicken, fried rice, and dim sum combo. Dim sum was bomb. General chicken was crispy and their broccoli was fresh. The only thing, their fried rice wasn't completely fried. And this order arrived way earlier which is good.<//Review>

<review>No beef with scrambled eggs. Unacceptable, it's a classic. Anyway, the lunch specials are good. The menu is a bit small but there are enough items to pick something to eat. The portions are small as well. I order egg rolls in addition to my entree. Grab lunch here. I don't know too much about dinner here.<//review>< Date>

The food here is amazing! My fiancé took me here for my birthday and it was one of the best birthday dinners I have ever had. They are located in Chinatown so parking is difficult. The ambiance inside is very nice, with a bar area, high ceilings, and nice lighting.< /review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Little China Restaurant is committed to giving the Los Angeles area a place to go for affordable and health consciously prepared gourmet Chinese cuisine. With made-to-order service, freshness is assured. A few of the specials include orange chicken, garlic chicken, sweet and sour chicken and shrimp with black bean sauce. Enjoy eating in for lunch or dinner at Little China Restaurant or call for take out or delivery. In addition, party trays are available for gatherings and events.

All the typical Chinese menu items are well represented including plenty of chicken, beef, pork, seafood and vegetable choices on the lunch menu. Vegetarians will enjoy the tofu with garlic sauce or the vegetable chop suey. For something spicy at Little China Restaurant, try the curry chicken or twice cooked pork. Kick anything up by asking for extra heat during preparation.< /text><GmapID>0x80c2be4f8e86892f:0x1e599a6515906f16<//GmapID>< time>

First time to eat here and I was impressed that the foods are so delicious. We ordered two entries and the place is presentable.The only downfall is that I think the price is way expensive compared to others. Nevertheless, this place is a gem. Their customer service is great.
Parking is terrible but there is a daily parking  nearby that cost 5$ a day.<//review>

It's so sad...they have good food but the delivery is HORRIBLE!!! Ordered at 5:15 pm waited over an hour then called only to be told their driver doesn't even arrive until 6:30pm!!!!!! This happened once before and I decided to give them another chance after not ordering for over a year...and once again this happens!!!!!!!</Text>

This is standard Chinese food but it is always good and not expensive.   I have eaten in and taken out regularly for years.   It has changed very little.   Always consistently good.  If you are into neighborhood Chinese food this is the spot.</review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Little China is a very friendly family owned restaurant. I have been enjoying their food for at least 5 years now. I always go there when I crave wonton soup and pork fried rice. (The garlic tofu and buddas feast are good too. ) They know me and greet me with smiles. Always delicious comfort food especially when it's cold outside. The only reason why I don't give them five stars is because the parking lot is small and the spaces seem more narrow than most. Also, the traffic from the other restaurant seems to attract a crowd that parks terribly and it makes it difficult to get a space most of the time. Aside from that, this is my go to place for consistently yummy chinese food. Give Little China place a try.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2be4f8e86892f:0x1e599a6515906f16<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I don't know what happened to this place cause it used to be amazing!  Maybe they lost the Chef but what ever the reason, I had lunch there today and truly - it was the very WORST chinese food that I have ever had! It was tasteless and a waste of $16.00. The service was ok, and I was very surprised that when I left - most of the food from past diners who left - was left on the tables as well - so I guess my experience wasn't just from me!  Stay away!< /Text>

Definitely not your average Panda Express, aka crap "Chinese."
This place is pretty darn decent.  The parking situations isn't too bad.  The restaurant is located across the street from Universal City Nissan, in a small plaza, but there are plenty of parking in their lot or metered.  The restaurant itself isn't glamorous, just the basics and not too impressive in size, with daily specials located on a small dry erase board.
I have only went for their lunch specials on the weekdays.  I can recommend the Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Garlic Chicken, and the Fish Filet in Black Bean Sauce.  Another that I recommend, but does not have a lunch-size, is the Kung Pao Beef or Little China Beef.  Portions are huge and definitely filling.  The egg roll included in the lunch special actually has pieces of chicken inside! Only down-side with the lunch specials are that the soup of the day is only served for dine-in only.  I always have my food to-go. If you order to-go as well, make sure to ask for the dipping sauce for your egg roll (if you need it), a spoon, and hot sauce (if you need it).    Those items are always left out of the bag for some reason.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It seems that he is not very friendly to Chinese-speaking guests, the owner's face is very ugly, and the food is unsatisfactory. Not recommended.

(Original)
似乎對說中文的客人不太友好，老闆臉色甚是難看，食物出品差強人意。不推薦。</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The boss and the wife are very nice, delicious, authentic, and big enough. I can't go wrong when I come. I like it very much.

< Review>
Pretty cool cash only bar, with a jukebox, pool table, and normal selection of alcohol. Only reason I'm docking a star is the cleanliness of the place, especially the pool table and surrounding area. Worth checking out if you're in the area but bring cash if you want to avoid the atm fee<//Review>

Stars because they were open later than the rest and had a pool table. I was dd with friends who wanted to let loose. Place was small, dirty, smelly and shady stuff going on in the back. Definitely not a tourist destination, nothing but locals at closing time.< /Text>

Really decent prices compared to the resort prices to be found pretty much everywhere else in the area.

Friendly staff and a good atmosphere.< /text>

Only place I know of in Truckee where you can get high end draught beers for under 5 bucks.  3 doors down the same beers are 7.</text>

<gmap_id>0x80c2c63c9fb08bd5:0xf35c986c63d574cb< /gmap_id><user_name>Jill Valentine<//user_name><text>I rented one of their hotdesks for a while there, and I do not recommend it. They do lots of loud and unnecessary events that make it really hard to focus and work. For some of them they straight up remove the desks, leaving you no choice other than finding somewhere else to work or just work from home.
I remember a particular time when a gentleman named John S. (from LACI) set up a photoshoot with very bright lights pointing directly to my face (imagine a car high beams 10 ft in front of you) while I was working on my desk. I just moved a small plant pot that was a few feet on my side so it blocks the light that was literally blinding me, and he approached me and just moved the plant back 3 feet to the side. I told him I couldn't work like that and he just told me to go work somewhere else. I did indeed go work somewhere else, permanently.<//text>< rating>

Amazing people all over the campus. This is a great venue in the arts district where science, technology, engineering, and art meet. (See what I did there? of course, math pulls it all together) I am very excited to see the impact from this community.  Every week is a buzz of energy and I highly recommend anyone interested in the future check this place out.<//Review>

Went to a professional development training here - very nice modern interior and exterior, full machine shops, wet labs, dry labs, work spaces, a cafe with snacks, etc. Great location in the arts district. Sometimes I feel like the back halls are a bit labyrinth-like when they didn’t necessarily need to be - overall the layout of the building feels a bit quirky and odd. The art work on the walls is very cool throughout.<//Review>

Great place to learn about renewable power and other tech stuff. They have CNC machines and 3D printers if you were ever interested in how they work. They also can do jobs for you for a price. Parking is a pain though.<//text>

<Text>It's an innovative campus, they have different workshops to help people build their projects or prototype. I was impressed with their CNC machinr lab and 3d printing lab the have some next level stuff in there. The downside is availability and training. It's a bit expensive too.</Text>< userid>

Incredibly impressive facility for startups in clean energy. Space was wonderful for hosting a company event for a training exercise. Easy parking with lots of parking spots for electric cars.</Text>

<Text>This location is home to the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (or LACI for short). It's a "place where entrepreneurs, engineers, scientists and policymakers can collaborate, promote and support the development of clean technologies and LA’s green economy".

In essence, it is one big collaboration space with various 'cleantech' startups, community groups, government agencies, and the like all working in close proximity to one another in order to bring about discussion, thoughts, and ideas to the progression of making this world (and LA in particular) a cleaner and greener place.

The LA Dept. of Water & Power has a large chunk of this area dedicated to a "Customer Engagement Center", where customers and the public can come view energy efficient technologies, water saving practices, and the 'home of the future'. People are able to come and view various smart appliances, lighting ideas, and water saving options, all the while learning how to earn rebates on them.

It's definitely worth taking a tour here, or coming to visit, as it gives you a sense of all the new and interesting ideas that are cropping up around green and 'clean' technology.<//Text><name>James Costanzo< /name></record>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Great Farmer's Market with a variety of vendors.  The market is small maybe 20-30 vendors but all have great quality products.  Lots of fresh vegetables, fruit, and fresh cooked food.  Most of the vendors have vegan friendly options.  This will be my go to option every Saturday for fresh, local produce.< /text>< pics>

This farmers market is slowly growing so this rating may improve over time. Right now the best things are the coffee company that offers coffee at $10/14-oz bag, and the fruit stand with peaches, oranges, nectarines, pulots, and other stone fruits. The fruits are exceptionally sweet and fresh compared to other farmers markets I've tried.< /review>

This farmer’s market is what our community needs!! Fresh, affordable, local and mostly organic produce at very affordable prices, knick-knacks and jewelry and plants and bike repair....it’s truly a gem in our backyard. I hope more people come to support this and that it continues to grow!!! Thank you so much to everyone who’s helped this come to life!!</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Great little farmers market open every Saturday. Getting there is very convenient -- a nice walk or bike ride if you live in the area or if you need to drive there is plenty of free adjacent parking. The booths are in the Lincoln High School parking lot on Dana Ave where there are large solar panels which provide shade. I've been getting my weekly supply of fruits and vegetables from this market since it started, very happy with the quality. I also always get some of the great hummus.

It is unfortunate that dogs are not allowed to be in the area where food is being sold, but this is legal requirement for the market to operate in the city and not lose its license to operate. Dogs are welcome outside the food vending area, and there is a dog park at Lincoln High School too. We sometimes bring our dog, and one of us hangs out with the dog under the shade of one of the solar panels while the other shops.<//text>< Pics>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Being able to once again walk to a neighborhood FM each Saturday is fantastic. We get our all of our eggs, strawberries, and stone fruit there each week, along with at least one yummy treat. The cashew-based milkshakes, cold-pressed juice, and Italian baked goods fill that last slot quite nicely.

After years of having a bike she was less than confident about, my wife bought a refurbished cruiser from the non-profit Community Cycles at the FM a few weeks ago. She loves it, so much that I just donated her old bike, and my daughter's outgrown 16" bike, this afternoon. They'll refurbish them, sell them, and the proceeds go to provide bikes and free maintenance to those that can't otherwise afford them.

We'll be back each and every week!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Great local market. Diverse selection of goods and very friendly vendors who are eager to share free samples. A fun place to stop by on a leisurely Saturday to enjoy the live music and pick up a snack. I’m not sure why the only 1-star review says “no dogs”. There were at least three when I was there today.

This market is in a great location near 3 public schools, a library & the Rose Garden. It has plenty of parking and the shade cover from the solar panels above keeps you cooler in the summer and drier when it rains. I really like some of the vendors, including the rice krispy treat vendor and the hummus one. This summer, the blackberries are delicious; we've been buying 5 packs of them every week and eating them as a healthy dessert!< /Text>

Hardly any vendors. I bought some prickly pear cactus ( to eat!) from a vendor and she plopped them in my hands rather than putting them in a bag ( I had to ask for a small paper bag) and I spent 20 minutes at home pulling stickers out of my hand.<//review>

A small but mighty, neighborhood farmers market. Several food booths, a variety of produce stalls, knife sharpening and more. This market will be open all year if it is supported by locals and beyond.< /review>

<review>Such a cute place,came here for a little nieces birthday party.
They had 2 pools, and 1 under conduction but it was pretty awesome!!
There was a kid pool in its own sections, fences away from the bigger pool, it makes it easier to book for parties and the other pools also fenced in from the others. Super cute!<//review>< rate>

What a neat place. My buddy lives in this neighborhood and I was impressed at the way the HOA has used their funds. I dont know if the HOA has any issues but this gives me hope in them. We played pool so that's all I can really comment on and I think the bumpers could use some help. However, we had fun. Also, the space that night was being used by some elementary school kids for a Christmas choir choir event was really sweet to experience even of only from the sound. I did see the pool and hot tub from the billiards room and they look wonderful. We plan on hitting the hot tub soon.< /text>

At present 2 of the pools are not available.They are under construction. Both the regular pool & kids pool are usable until at least the end of June. Somewhat disappointing since summer has already began.</review>

The upstairs area is a very nice place to study. The pools are far too strict though for the most idiotic things. Ive been told multiple times in the past that I was not allowed to use the lap pool due to my age even though I was just swimming laps. If this is a selling point to get you to move to an HOA, then it's not worth it due to the unlikeliness of actually using the facilities on even a weekly basis. There are food trucks every Tuesdays during the summer which is awesome.</Text>

<user_name>Janice Bailey<//user_name><Text>We attended a 40th birthday party for a nephew.. The clubhouse staff were cordial,  hospitable,  friendly,  and attendant.  The inside spaces are clean,  large enough to host 150 people,  and gave access you the pool area which has an adult pool,  Jacuzzi,  wading pool, several patio tables with very sturdy chairs, and 2 or 3 large covered barbecue areas with picnic tables.  Towards the end,  a female staff person came out to give our host last minute instructions. She was elated at the progress of our cleanup and stated they usually  have to come out to ensure the guests have cleared and  cleaned the area but they came out an hour ago and our area was already being cleaned. She thanked our host!!<//Text></record>

Beautiful clubhouse, abusulutly breathtaking. It's has all the top notch amenities, and the staff there takes security very seriously to make sure of the individuals that are members belongs there. I was very impressed with their system of security, and the staff were very informed and curtisous. I have church family that lives in the community, and was invited to have a BBQ in the Anatolia Clubhouse...< /Review>

I have been taking my kids to Gentle Dental for awhile now, everyone in the office is very friendly and professional. They have responded very well to COVID guidelines. Cassandra, in particular, is awesome! She is great with my kids, especially my younger one, who is always nervous at the dentist.<//Text>

I highly recommend this place. Staff are very friendly and answered all my questions regarding insurance and out of pocket costs. Before we proceeded with any work, we went over my monthly payment plan, what my insurance covered, and what I would have to cover. They educate you about the work you will get done through some quick videos and answer all your questions with a smile. Thank you Gentle Dental for making me feel safe to come to the dentist during this time. Excited to come routinely knowing I have a great office.< /Text>

<user_id>103010803949801337678<//user_id><Review>Dr. Simonian recently made a new set of dentures for my father and they are terrific! Actually, he made his previous set as well when he worked in the Riverside office.

Dr. Simonian is by far the best dentist I’ve ever had. His knowledge, experience, and chair side manner is what everyone hopes their dentist will provide.

The office staff was professional and courteous. Although due to CoVid there isn’t a waiting room, there is ample area in front with a bench to sit.

My experience with the Rancho Cucamonga office was pleasant and easy. I highly recommend.</Review>< Date>

<review>I love this dentist ! First time was a great experience . The dentist usually makes me nervous which is why I hadn’t been in 2 years .
The tech Cassie was super sweet and informative about all my questions . The hygienist Leslie was a saint . I ended up needing a deep cleaning , she was gentle with the numbing shots even though I was a complete baby and made me relaxed and always checked on me . She did a thorough job and my teeth and gums already feel 10 times better. Great staff , glad I found my new dentist< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I have been receiving my orthodontic treatment initially at Gentle Dental Pomona and then continuously at Gentle Dental Foothill since over a year ago.  I am so pleased that I decided to pursue my treatment through orthodontic team at Gentle Dental Foothill.  My each visit with Dr. Abed and the other team members has been so professional and exceptional, and I know with confidence that I am in the best hands!  The office staff, Navi and Rosa are very kind and caring and greet me with genuine smiles no matter how busy they are.  I recommend orthodontic team at Gentle Dental Foothill without any hesitation to anyone who is seeking professional and exceptional orthodontic treatment.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I've came to this Dental Office with my family and every time I come we're always welcomed with a smile and such a welcoming vibe, the receptionists are so nice, the Dr. is really great at they're work; very professional at what they do and describe everything they're doing to you to make you more comfortable with your visit. I would really recommend this Dentist Office to all my friends and family and new visitors as well.<//Review>

First dental office where I don’t wait 2 hours in the waiting room and then another hour inside on the chair. The doctor gets straight to the point and was not advised that we needed an endless number of work done. Overall, the staff at the desk and the dental assistants are very friendly.<//Text>

<text>Extremely pleased! Had a bad experience at my previous dentist, but was transferred to Gentle Dental Foothill (Rancho Cucamonga) when the Pomona location closed. I think it will be a great fit! Dr. Simonian was warm and friendly, and explained everything thoroughly. Christina the dental tech and Rosa in the front office were kind and patient, which means everything to me.

Today I decided to attend a different dental office due to bad experiences at my old one. Gentle Dental welcomes you from when you open the door walking in to when you are leaving closing the door. The doctor Sielski was very nice from the start. He told me what procedures needed to be done and the front office helped me out with a payment plan. I left the office very pleased with my first appointment.<//Review>

Years ago, I used to drive all the way from Orange County to Riverside County to get my teeth cleaned by Dr. Michael Simonian. Why? Because, he was literally the ONLY dentist that I could find that wasn't trying to swindle me. As far as I'm concerned, his bedside manner and technique are bar none. He's the guy you refer patients to who might be afraid to go to the dentist. He is super sweet and honest. Sadly, he left California altogether, and set up shop in Nevada for years. I was sure that we had lost him for good. Recently, my mother was looking for a dentist, and she found a certain name that sounded awfully familiar to her. Luckily, I was there when she asked me about him, and now she is a believer as well. I couldn't be happier that Dr. Simonian is back where he belongs, in California! If you are looking for a dentist, please look no further. Because, you will NOT find a better dentist anywhere. This man simply cares about doing it right, and doing it honestly. I can't tell you how many other dentists would try to pull the wool over my eyes, and I would have to go to him to get the honest to goodness truth. Dr. Simonian has saved me a lot of time, grief, and money over the years. Now, he's taking care of another generation of my family. God bless you Dr. Simonian. I hope you never retire or ever leave us again! :)  Yes, my mother and father drive all the way from Orange County to Rancho Cucamonga, just to see Dr. Simonian, because he is absolutely worth it.  If you have Gentle Dental, please make sure that he is your doctor!  You'll be glad you did.< /text>

i am 55 yrs old and this is my first google review. I set up a yelp account- that I said I would never do, because I was so impressed. It took me 4 years of looking but I finally found an honest dentist that does great work.
They got me right in as a new patient, did the exam, gave me options and advice, and most importantly didn't try to force me to buy a bunch of unneeded work like western dental & most of the others I tried.
the front office staff is awesome, and the new dentist is spectacular. he is very professional and knowledgeable for his young age and I am looking forward to having him take care of my family. I already sent my wife to them and she also had a great experience.
I hope this review helps their rating- im not really a google reviewer. but i wish i could give them 10 stars. i think the last dentist there must have been really bad, because there is no way that the current staff only deserves 2 stars! i think they must have low stars because of the last administration.
I trust these people and highly recommend them.

RDA Cassandra was also awesome and carrying to make sure that I knew why to do after the extraction and the proper way to take care of it. The receptionist Navi was awesome she helped me out with filling out my paperwork and helping me get just a simple coupon to help my payment. Like so carrying. TC Rosa super amazing she found every possible way I can still get helped today and the best cost efficient way to help me with my procedure from here on out. Hygienist Leslie super carrying made sure I was comfortable and gave me great guidance on how to continue to take care of my teeth. Overall I would tell everyone to have this office as your dentist. They are carrying kind and concerned about anything that may happen to you. Love love love them. Thanks for the best experience at your dentist office it was well noticed<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

They have the worst billing dept. I paid all my bills on time and paid off the CARE CREDIT early. I was then surprised I few months later when I checked my credit score. Turns out they sent me to collections for an additional $400 that I was never sent a bill for. I called and they said my insurance did not cover a portion of the work done. So they billed me. I never received a bill, or a phone call to tell me of this. I was given a tel # to corporate so I can question this bill. I left at least 6 voicemails in 2 weeks with no response. The staff at Gentle dental could not help with this either. So I left one last voicemail to corporate that I am trying to contact them to pay this bs bill. Only then did they have staff from the dentist office call me back. I found it very disturbing that they only called me when they thought I was gonna give them money, rather than hear my complaint about their billing practices. I refused to pay on principal. They stated they would wave the charges, and remove my debt collection on my credit. Well it's been over a year and I still have the debt collection reported on my credit. Don't go hear. I have family who have similar billing issues with this place.</review>

<Response>{'time': 1500677435025, 'text': 'Gabriel Menchaca, Gentle Dental accepts most, if not all, insurance plans.  Each plan has their own guidelines and fee schedules.  Our policy is to estimate our patients’ copayments based on the current information in our system. The insurance companies will copy us on the Evidence of Benefit (EOB) that is sent to the patient.  The EOB outlines what is being paid by the insurance company and what, if any additional fees, are the patient’s responsibility.  We will send a statement to the patient shortly after the EOB is received.  There are multiple communications sent to the patient before being transferred to the collection agency.  We hope you will give us the opportunity to serve you again.

<Review>The food was super yummy, no doubt about that, but where my rating is based off of is the customer service at this location. I ordered 2 sides, a corn dog, and one slider. It was Memorial Day (5/31/21) and I placed my order at 8:44pm. Wasn’t a busy day but I still waited 30minutes for the food to arrive. Also, when a server brought food out to a group who was already there before me, she started recommending someone else from that group a food item, took money from him, and in no time brought out whatever item she had recommended.. like if her only priority was that one guy… I understand the wait at a restaurant and I’m patient but what I don’t understand is the wait for such a small order. I mean, even the group who ordered AFTER me got their food first. On top of that, some items from my order were burnt! I’d definitely give this place another shot since from what I tasted it deserves another shot, but they’ve got to work on their customer service and the quality of the food they're serving.

*From the pictures: Although you can’t tell very well, the corn dog and the onion rings were really burnt and had a bitter taste to them. The really tiny slider was so yummy but $2.50 for that?! Yikes! And the cheese tots were also super yummy but they’re pretty cheap with the cheese:/< /Review><Name>Veronica N< /Name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2dm99ubOPRKWCoqZbFuKP61PsWPC56hH1JTlW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN84wtO6g5Zn3Q9nLK1hZji6S_D7eq0d63A24g0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><UserId.>117388824932897549196< /UserId.><Rating>3< /Rating><Resp>{'time': 1623104942630, 'text': 'Hi Veronica,\n\nThank you for sharing your recent experience at Dog Haus Biergarten Northridge with us.

<review>Ordered the bratwurst burrito, T-Mex Sausage with Southwestern tots and a cold 805. The food was delicious and I definitely ordered more than I could eat. The sausage was juicy, had great flavor, fresh toppings, soft bread and good sauce. Tater tots were so crunchy outside, tasty sauce and cheese. Burrito was hefty and filling with good flavor. Washed it all down with a cold 805. The staff was friendly and it was clean inside. Thankfully they had outside seating, cute lights across the top and a tv playing football. It's located along a strip of other shops and there's a pretty big parking lot in the back. They have a bunch other tasty options so will definitely be back.</review><username>Anna “Krimzin Art”< /username>< GmapID>

I come here today 5/25/2021 and the young lady with the glasses, Tiffany helped me with my order and her customer service was absolutely amazing she recommended the chicken sandwich and even that was amazing to. Along with the respectful attitude and swiftness she had while taking my order. She has a lot of patience. 10/10 would totally recommend</Review>

<Text>I got dog haus over in canoga park and it was amazing but I ordered from the northridge location today and was not impressed. There were STEMS in my beyond breakfast burrito so they clearly didn't separate the arugula leaves from the stems. The beyond meet was dry and burnt. The egg is over done and rubbery. It also wasn't put together very well. I'm not impressed. On top of all that it was significantly more expensive than in canoga park and not sure why. Can't even eat this it's so bad which is incredibly disappointing compared to how great it was at the other location.<//Text>< Rating>

I love hotdogs and my go to hotdog spot is usually Dirt Dog but it was a little out of my way so I stopped by here and I was not disappointed. Ordered Sooo Cali dog, Cowboy and one corndog and one sausage corndog. Wasn't a fan of the the sausage corndog but everything else was fire. Plan on trying everything on the menu at least once.< /review>

<review>Food was great but over priced. When you pay a high price for a burger you expect it to fill you up and this burger didn't do it. Tastes great but not feeling.But this is not why I'm leaving a two-star review. I'm in the service industry and customer service everything to me. I sat at the outdoor table and the little sign that reads dirty or clean was set on dirty. When the guy brought out my food I asked if he can clean the table before we eat. His reply was, oh I think it's clean they just forgot to slide the little door that reads clean. At that point he reached over and switched it to clean. With covid going around, everyone has the right to have a clean spot to eat. As an employee his response should have been, my apologies, let me clean your table for you. Regardless of what he thought, he should have cleaned my table so that my son and I can feel comfortable eating. Management please make sure your employees are accommodating your customers needs. As customers coming into your establishment we should be feeling safe but instead I had a very unpleasant visit.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I really enjoy food from the Dog Haus but I’ve had food from this location multiple times and it’s not good. The fries and hash tastes like it’s cooked in old oil. See the photo of the bottom of the barrel hash browns we got. It wasn’t very good. I would suggest going to the Dog Haus on Tampa.< /Text>

< Review>
This restaurant is very nasty. As I was waiting for my order, I observed a Door Dash delivery driver pick up an order and with that order there was a drink that came with it. The Door Dash delivery driver was told that he had to fill the cup up with the drink that was listed on the order. The Door Dash delivery driver put his hands inside the cup and touched the inside of the lid. Then that delivery driver will be delivering to a customer. I don’t know why this restaurant allows the drivers to fill those cups up for customer with Covid-19 being a priority. Someone could get sick from that carelessness. This restaurant is not taking those precautions at all. Also too many homeless people hanging around this restaurant outside. I don’t recommend coming to this location. I will be reporting this all because I have video footage I recorded</Review>

I HAVE ATTENDED THIS PLACE FROM DAY 1, I HAVE A LOCAL OFFICE NEAR BY. OWNERS ARE BEUTIFUL PEOPLE.
WHEN THE OWNERS ARE THERE THE EMPLOYEES HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THINS LIKE THE HAPPY HOUR DISCOUNTS.

I ATTENDED TODAY 5/3/21 AS USUAL AND I DRINK THE 1ST LITER AT REGULAR PRICE THE 2ND IS ALWAYS AFTER 3PM THE CASHIER REFUSED TO GIVE ME THE DISCOUNT ON A LITER.

VERY DISAPOINTED AND LEFT..........<//Text>

I haven't been going out for food much since the shut down but I was REALLY craving a Dog Haus dog! 🤤 I was glad to see a familiar face, Noushin is always so friendly! Mohammad Ali rang me up and he was also very nice.

The food here is AMAZING! SO MANY unique and tasty dogs along with quite a few other mouth watering items.

I definitely recommend Dog Haus. *Tip: sign up for their app, it's easy to use to browse the menu and order thru, plus there are some REALLY great perks!

Pretty disappointing. Corn dogs burnt, food was greasy, staff apathetic and was ready 20 minutes after the pick up time they scheduled.<//Review>

This was my tenth time visiting Dog Haus, and I'm still struggling to say anything bad about this franchise! The Northridge location is particularly impressive and consistent. See below for my full review of this spot.

Pros:
• Delicious food! The frieburger is a MUST if you like eggs and fries in your burger. 🍔
• Fast service!
• Bomb happy hour deals!
• Extensive tap list that's filled with beer fr local breweries! 🍻
• Clean and maintaining Covid safety protocols!

Cons:
• Honestly, none! 🤷🏾‍♀️ I mean, I'd love it if the food was slightly less expensive, but I still find it to be well priced for the quality.<//review>

Vegan impossible burgers and hot dogs for the win! Food is great. Didn't try the beer. They need to get more organized about outside seating, or close it and be strictly take out. Trying to figure out if tables were clean was not a pleasant experience. Get your stuff for take out.< /Review>

Waited 30 minutes for 2 breakfast burritos. When we finally got our order, the eggs in the burrito were raw. Not jist sunnyside up but absolutely raw egg whites and all. Took it back for a refund.
I was really looking forward to trying the breakfast burritos.Very disappointed!
They refunded me for the burritos but still charged me $6. for 2 very small drinks!
Horrible service, even worse food.</review>

I ordered the double cheeseburger with grilled onions and it was one of the best burgers I’ve ever tasted. The buns were sweet which added texture to the already tasty burger. Highly recommended.</Text>

<Text>I haven't been going out for food much since the shut down but I was REALLY craving a Dog Haus dog! 🤤 I was glad to see a familiar face, Noushin is always so friendly! Mohammad Ali rang me up and he was also very nice.

The food here is AMAZING! SO MANY unique and tasty dogs along with quite a few other mouth watering items.

I definitely recommend Dog Haus. *Tip: sign up for their app, it's easy to use to browse the menu and order thru, plus there are some REALLY great perks!

Man, it's hard to find a good hot dog spot, especially when you're vegetarian, but Dirt Dog is that spot! With its loudly played, yet not overbearing, music and upbeat and friendly staff, the all around experience is great, not to mention the fact that they actually have good veggie options! It's a must try!<//Review>

Got our food to go. Unfortunately when we arrived back at our complex, the food just fell off the bag and dropped on the dirty floor. Found out that the bag doesn't have enough glue to hold weight of food. Called them up and they couldn't issue a refund over the phone and that it had to be done in person. We were just hungry and wanted our food so they re-order our food and gave us new bag. They were aware of this issue and had a few other incidents, hopefully they'll get this fixed.

Rating is for the delicious dogs and service. The place has an industrial feel and always plenty of parking in the back.< /review>

< Review>
DogHaus was awesome. They have so many options of hot dogs, links and burgers. The quality was excellent and the presentation of the food very nice. The groupon is def worth it, but without a groupon, the prices are still affordable. For vegetarians, they have a veggie dog and sides you could munch on. The portions are good, so you may not need to get a side with your hotdog or burger. Other than that, it was worth the visit, I drove from LA to Northridge. The restaurant felt like a fancy "millenial" wienerschiztel...idk if I spelled that right, but hope you got my drift. You can dine-in or take out. This is one of my fave new spots.<//Review>

Man, it's hard to find a good hot dog spot, especially when you're vegetarian, but Dirt Dog is that spot! With its loudly played, yet not overbearing, music and upbeat and friendly staff, the all around experience is great, not to mention the fact that they actually have good veggie options! It's a must try!</text>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>This used to be my all time favorite halal burger place, but I recently found out that the bacon is pork, and it comes in a lot of menu options such as their burgers and hotdogs. I thought it would be halal turkey bacon because the store claims to have “100% guarantee of no cross contamination between beef and pork” But if they put pork bacon in the items themselves how can that be true? It’s common sense. I had to throw away an entire burger and honestly I lost the trust I had in them.< /text>< pics>

Great food lots to try. Lots of options and choices. Vegan veggie chicken chilli.
Staff friendly and helpful personable.
"The hype is real"   the parking however is horrible... Got there about 30min before the 12 lunch rush and drove in circles for about 20mins. Its crammed and crazy. But I would go back for the food. I would love to go try something different each time.  Great job Dirt Dogs</Text>

Worth the hype! Everything about this place is awesome. The food was fresh flavorful and so unique! Must try if you are in the Los Angeles area. I also tried their watermelon agua fresca and it was AMAZING!< /Text>

<text>My food was somehow overdone on the outside and underdone on the insides, and besides all that it wasn't great.  Plus it took a long time to be served compared to everyone else at my table.  With everyone wearing masks and the volume inside the place it was hard to communicate properly, but I was straight up ignored by what appeared to be a senior staff person who was too busy doing whatever to look up.</text>< pictures>

<rate>4< /rate><review>As a vegetarian who didn’t give up meat because I didn’t like it, I’m always thrilled to be treated like a “full citizen” at meat-centric restaurants, and I got that treatment here at The Dog Haus (Northridge, CA location) where they have a veggie hot dog, a veggie sausage, and a veggie burger all available to go on any of their menu items.

It’s an order at the counter, small-ish establishment with craft beers on top and a family friendly / bar environment.

I was glad I could order anything off the menu and specify the vegetarian protein I wanted in it, though I rolled-my own with the the vegan apple sage sausage with mustard, onions and sauerkraut and cheddar cheese. This was super yummy. The flavor and texture of the veggie sausage was spot-on…the bun was perfect and I would definitely eat this again!

I also had tots on the side…these were perfectly cooked, not over done, not underdone…just the right amount of crispy on the outside with the inside being as tender as it should be.

Pair that with the stout on draft beer and I felt like a full fledged human being eating at a meat restaurant despite my vegetarianism. It was all super-yummy!

My son had a veggie hot dog with ketchup. He didn’t love it but I think it’s because there was too much ketchup on it, but in my eyes the veggie dog itself on his sandwich looked pretty good, and large (unlike the small veggie dogs you see in packages in the market.)

Since I was dining in, I wish the beer had come in a real glass, even a reusable plastic stein instead of a throw away plastic cup. I saw someone drinking from a large stein and think if people are dining in they should automatically serve in reusable glasses instead of throw-awayables (or at least ask what you want there...better for the environment and "nices up" the experience a bit to not be drinking out of a plastic cup,  but other than that I loved the meal there. The service was super-friendly and fast and I will definitely be back again!< /review>< Pictures>

What a place to go for amazing food. Not only is this place professional with amazing staff, but also has high quality in the food that they offer the customers. The Hangover burger is the way to go honestly. Their meat is so fresh and i really appreciated the atmosphere every time that I go. I would recommend going with family, friends, or just to grad a quick bite.<//Review>

<text>Great tasting food, but a bit over priced IMO. Ordered online for pick up and tracker said almost 40 mins to pick up, I showed up like 10 mins early to find my food was ready. Even though the tracker said still being prepared, I got my food and it wasn't warm anymore. They need to update the tracker to show customers the real time status. Plenty of parking in the rear of establishment or on street in front.<//text>< Pics>

Yeah it's a local chain, but it's a good one. This version has beer, ample parking, outdoor seating, and access to the Dodgers channel. Dogs, burgers and sides are all good with lots of interesting toppings, and they have beyond beef sausages and impossible burger patties for the non-meat eaters. Friendly staff. Portion sizes are reasonable so over-order if you eat a lot.</review>

<Text>DogHaus was awesome. They have so many options of hot dogs, links and burgers. The quality was excellent and the presentation of the food very nice. The groupon is def worth it, but without a groupon, the prices are still affordable. For vegetarians, they have a veggie dog and sides you could munch on. The portions are good, so you may not need to get a side with your hotdog or burger. Other than that, it was worth the visit, I drove from LA to Northridge. The restaurant felt like a fancy "millenial" wienerschiztel...idk if I spelled that right, but hope you got my drift. You can dine-in or take out. This is one of my fave new spots.</Text>< time>

<Text>Yeah it's a local chain, but it's a good one. This version has beer, ample parking, outdoor seating, and access to the Dodgers channel. Dogs, burgers and sides are all good with lots of interesting toppings, and they have beyond beef sausages and impossible burger patties for the non-meat eaters. Friendly staff. Portion sizes are reasonable so over-order if you eat a lot.</Text>< username>

< Review>
The food wasn't fresh. I asked for fresh taters and was told that they're made in batches every 30 minutes and he refused to make me fresh taters. (And the beer was flatt) Because of that I only go to the BURBANK location. Just seems like there more experienced and have a better crew there.

Have been here a few more times since then and outside of the taters everything else is bomb !!! 💯</Review>

Soooooooo goood! We went here randomly because we were craving street dogs... OMG the best!!! We got the elote dog, the flamin dog and the house dog with asada fries and everything was great! The fries needed a little bit of seasoning and I was not a huge fan of it but everything else was amazing! Since I went for the hotdogs and fries was just a bonus I'll keep it at 5 stars!< /Review>

Dog-haus that is in Northridge is the best place. They have outstanding foods. The environment is very friendly, and the beer line is outstanding!!!!
It’s the best Dog-Haus in The Valley yet. They have outside seating and a lot of parking space in the rear side. I’m eager to eat at this place again. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

The staff here is super friendly & helpful. After two recent experiences at this spot, I am eager to return again in the near future. The delicious novelty of putting everything (burgers & dogs) on King's Hawaiian Rolls was an unexpected delight! They have a nice selection of beers too. I still want to try the tater tots with chili & cheese on top.</Text>

I think the problem is that staffing lacks. For example: One person managing the phones and taking orders at the counter is just not a good situation with a line of 4+ people, particularly when they are clearly dealing with a GrubHub customer. Another time they obviously screwed up an order by scraping off the sauce, but thankfully it was replaced. If this place wasn't in walking distance to my home I'm not sure I'd go as often as do.< /Review>< pics>

<review>I had the cowboy hot dog, the cheese fries, and the chocolate shake, all of which were really great. The dogs are great, bacon wrapped, and served on a Hawaiian roll bun. The fries are good and not soggy. The shake was tasty.
Highly recommend. They seem to have a happy hour for alcohol as well.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>WARNING LONG READ! I had a bad experience about a month or so ago. Last night I went back by myself, to the same DogHaus, ordered my food and waited for takeout. I purchased a Groupon voucher the day of my bad experience, and didn't use it. My niece, who's recently paralyzed in L.A. told me she wanted to see me, and to bring something new and different from the valley. I thought to myself she might like the Dog Haus. I ordered the Mensch, spicy chicken, and  cheesy taters. Due,to me using a voucher you must dine in. The young man explain to me the dilemma, but he honored me a one-time courtesy. I didn't have to explain anything to him,  he was extremely generous and courteous. It was late and I was not looking forward to the ride to L.A..  While waiting, I had a chance to watch the young lady at the register, she was very welcoming to all who approached her, and very patient. She also acknowledged other customers as they were walking in to dine. While I was there  the line became very long, but everyone was pleasant. This gave me a sense that they too know that love, and comfort food is being served in this establishment. When my food was delivered to me the gentlemen informed me, that he had given me a 10% discount on my next order. I thought that was nice. I'm  so glad that I'm  a person of second chances. I experienced an easy flow ordering, food cooked to order, and a goody with delivered. All this to say that the drive to LA was not what I  wanted, but my niece eating those cheesy taters w/ ketchup was priceless. She loved them more than she loved the Spicy Chicken. She ate the sandwich and we got to stay up til 4am, talking about the last 2 months of 2020. Thanks Dog Haus, I don't drink beer, but I will be bringing my folks whenever they come to the valley to  visit.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

We also had the pleasure in meeting one of the owners as well as his younger brother. The owner is in this business with his heart and soul. You can see and feel it. You gotta try it! You will not regret it!< /Text>< Rating>

We love this place! We have been coming here once a week for years and it's a family favorite. We've tried most items on their menu and I can confidently say that they've got some of the best burgers, fries, and hot dogs I've ever had anywhere in Los Angeles or elsewhere for that matter. You must check it out if you're in the area. The quality of their food is amazing. The service is excellent and they really take pride in the food they serve. It's a completely fabulous experience you're sure to enjoy!< /Text>

.79 for side of ranch dressing! At least full the cup to the top. Cheap place charging so much and skimping on the dressing. Noticed service and quality gets worse over time. Not long till they close and something better opens up. Upon reading others review the owner/manager couldn't care less by only responding with a cheesy lame copy paste response. I expect no different.<//Review>

Amazing service from Farbod. He treated my kids very well, gave them some cookies for free to please them. At the end, my daughter wanted to pay for and extra cheese on the fries, and he didnt want to charge it. Super friendly and polite. The food is great, and the amazing service just make us want to come back more.</Review>

The food was good but let me tell you about the service.
The last time I went there I had just had spine surgery and I felt awful.  It must have been apparent from the  way i looked and the neck brace I was wearing.  I was the only person in line and I could not get waited on.  The manager and staff were arguing  about someone's beer bill and how to charge them.  I think it must have been obvious that I could barely stand but stand I did.  When I finally  ordered my food I was thinking the  bill seemed kind of high.  When I looked at my receipt I realized they charged me  for the two beers for the other customer.  I ordered a shake for my meal and it arrived when I was leaving.  They did take the two beers off the bill though.  I emailed  the company about the poor service and got no response.  They are  probably  ticked off that I didn't pay  for the two beers.< /Text>

Very good hamburgers and dogs. I love the fact that the buns are from Hawaiian rolls. I got the downtown dog, which was very good.  I also got the hangover haus burger, which was amazing, and the egg was the best part. They sell pints and liters of beer. Nice spot. A must try if in the area.< /Text>

<Review>Cute decor inside and out. Friendly and helpful staff. From the conversations, lots of return customers. We ate the chicken sandwich but that is not what they are known for so not fair to comment except that it was ok and a choice for non beef eaters. Would be nice if fries were included with the meals.<//Review>< user>

The food is good.  How ever the burgers are way too messy.  Falls apart after 3 bites but I guess that's how it's supposed to be. 🧐  not too crowded. Good burgers fair priced.</Text>

<Review>The food wasn't fresh. I asked for fresh taters and was told that they're made in batches every 30 minutes and he refused to make me fresh taters. (And the beer was flatt) Because of that I only go to the BURBANK location. Just seems like there more experienced and have a better crew there.

Have been here a few more times since then and outside of the taters everything else is bomb !!! 💯</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I had a holy aioli with impossible patties and extra bacon.

I know getting bacon with a sustainable plant based vegan burger is blasphemous, but it's bacon.

They use Hawaiian rolls as buns so you can pull off a piece and share but you probably wont want to because this is one of the most delicious burgers out there.< /Review>< Rate>

This place wasn't all that great. The atmosphere was more of a college hangout, the food wasn't anything special and it was overpriced. Two of the three burgers ordered were prepared improperly and had to be remade. The worker informed of this mistake wasn't very pleasant about it. She informed the cook whom in turn looked back at us with a disgusted look, making it a little uncomfortable. It wasn't till we talked to the shift manager that the problem was resolved properly. She refunded our party for the bad experience and comped our next visit. She is the only reason I decided to give this place three stars. Despite the generosity of refund and comp, this establishment will not receive my business. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone I know.< /text>

This rating is fake.
No way do they deserve over 4 stars.
I'd give zero(0) stars if available.
I give it the lowest rating possible based on service. Plus, horrible delivery service.
Beware! Sodium Nitrate.< /review>

Excellent burgers and sides.  This is NOT your typical fast food.  It's a premium  burger or dog.  Those complaining about "overpriced" need to understand this.

The burgers are generous.  You taste REAL beef, not "breaded" by product.  I've had both the onion rings and tots.  The rings are excellent and the tots are not greasy.  The service has been friendly each time I've gone.  I look forward to returning.  I appreciate the classic rock music and overall atmosphere.  The servers are attentive and the food orders are quick, especially when burgers are made to order.

If you love burgers, Dog  Haus is a must.<//text>

I am post this review to help people with dietary restrictions.

I'm celiac and before I ordered food from them I called the store to make sure my impossible burger would be 100% vegan and gluten-free. I was assured by their chef and manager that I was safe. Minutes after finishing the burger I noticed my usual reaction and started digging around the internet to find out that they don't have gluten-free buns, much less gluten-free and vegan buns.<//review>

Delicious food and great beer selection. They even have a few vegetarian options that can be vegan if you ask. The staff is always friendly and there is plenty of parking and seating.< /Review>

Good food and friendly staff. I enjoyed my "Little Mule" burger but did not like the 4 slider buns it was served on. We also ordered the hangover burger, mensch burger, and Scott Baio-some dog.  While we enjoyed all the food, we liked the hangover burger the best.</Review>

Hot dog and bun are great. Chili and sauerkraut are such small portions. Save your money. Stick with just the hot dog. Expensive for what you get.</text>

Good variety of beer on tap. Interesting selection of food. Problem for me is that I'm not a fan of sweet Hawaiian bread which they use for buns. This food is savory to me and doesn't go well with sweet bread.<//Text>

This place is great. If you like hot dogs and hamburgers then this is the place for you. You can build your own or have one of their many creations. Also tator tots, fries and onion rings are available as sides. Beer is also served here and they do happy hour specials in the afternoon. A little pricey but defintely good eats.<//review>
</record></dataset><record>
<review>Finally tried this place. Got the beer battered chicken sandwich. The chicken was so thickly battered and soaking in oil. Had to pull off all the batter so I could just eat the chicken. Onion rings were the most disgusting onion rings ever. Cheese tots were fine. Won't be returning here.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c29bac50cf4285:0xef08fdf34f8d1ae4</Gmap_id>< user_name>

<rate>3< /rate><text>I used to really like this place, but the time before last I tried to order my usual and they had changed their plant-based sausage. I hadn't tried the Beyond Sausage before, but I figured I'd give it a go. After ordering and waiting nearly 30 minutes for 2 hot dogs to go, I noticed on my receipt it just said 'bratwurst' so I asked the cashier who rung me up if that was for the Beyond Bratwurst I ordered and he said "yeah, bratwurst" and I asked again "BEYOND bratwurst?" And he looked so confused and just shrugged and said "bratwurst" again. At this point the owner of this location comes over. Let me also add that on their menu, it is literally labelled as "Beyond Bratwurst" if you don't even know the name of something on the menu right behind you, I have no idea how to help you understand. The owner at this point understands what I am saying and begins to make excuses for her employee saying that the menu is new and they haven't gotten used to it. Then she tells me that it'll take another 30 minutes because the vegan meats are kept frozen, but if I want I can just have the regular bratwurst because it's almost done. She says this implying that it is my fault it'll take longer by being vegan when in reality if her employee had just listened to me it would've been finished at that point. I was clearly upset still so she offered to give me a refund. I paid with the mobile app because I forgot my wallet at home and she said there was nothing she could do to refund me since I used the app. I understand that's not her fault, but if she's the owner she should've been able to figure out another way to refund me. She eventually gave me two coupons for free items which didn't really help me because it was only for that location which is the furthest location from me AND it meant I needed to go back there which I didn't plan on doing. So I finally got my vegan bratwurst, ran late to pick up my boyfriend, and then got to try the Beyond sausage for the first time. 2 bites in, I couldn't stomach it and threw it away. So much for all that waiting and my free menu item coupons. I loved the Field Roast they used to have there and while I'm glad they've made a huge step in having an entire Plant Based vegan menu with Impossible Burgers and Sliders and 2 types of Beyond Sausage, it tastes too much like meat for me and it doesn't sit well in my stomach. I literally gave up meat because I didn't like the taste so it's great if you still like the taste, I just don't. I did go back to try it again when the circumstances weren't bad and I used those coupons (about a month later), and this time I did finish the hot dog, but it was more because I was hungry and it didn't make me sick that time even though I still didn't care for the taste. If you like the new vegan Beyond and Impossible, you'll probably like Dog Haus, but this location is now one I won't go to again.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I am a man who loves his beer and loves his dogs, and let me tell you, this place has the best of both. I could probably scarf down these dogs every day and still be coming back for more. The flavor is stupendous, although the food is a little messy, so be prepared for a sloppy time.<//review>

Their dogs are the best. A bit pricey when ordering multiple items, but amazing food overall.</review>

Very cool design, decent food, decent selection + vegetarian options.
Some of the dogs are just way too big unless you have a shark bite. I was struggling keeping it together. Good flavor but very messy to eat.<//Review>

I just changed my review from a5 star to a one star. New owners who don't get it. They cut the bun and sausage in half and charged more. It's like eating a kids meal. Your kidding right? Changed product also. Awful. Won't be back. To bad<//text>

I've gone to the dog haus in Noho,but stopped by the one on Northridge and everyone was very friendly. Tater tots are to die for very crispy. You need to try the downtown dog that's my favorite.

<Text>Located inside an old IHOP on the Western side of Reseda Blvd.  Very large parking lot located in the rear.  Small entry to the lot from Reseda that's easy to miss driving by. Much easier entry from Baird.  Menu consists of hot dogs, sausages, burgers, and sides.  Handful of beers on tap (pint, liter, or pitcher).  Burgers are well made and flavorful. Buns are King's Hawaiian Rolls (4-per burger), whichs sounds odd but works pretty well.  Utensils are located near the soft-drink machine you pass by on the way in.  Variety of tables and bar seating, with some available outdoors.  Service is decent.  Prices are on the high side, but not ridiculous and generally worth it.<//Text>< Pics>

I enjoyed the Holy Aioli Burger, which is one of my favorites. My husband enjoyed another fav, the Mench, which has plenty of pastrami on it. We also shared a side of well done tots. We called in the order and it was done within 5 minutes of my arrival. There's a nice bar top that I briefly waited at. If you live in the area, Dog Haus sends frequent coupons...BOGO burgers etc. Also, I received an additional 10% cash back through Yelp 🤑 My only complaint would be the fact that the Reseda street entrance is not accessible for entry/exiting, which is a safety issue given that there's only one other public exit.<//review>

<text>Sorry guys the food was awful!  Tasted greasy and frying oil was awful and made tater tots taste weird.  Sliders were not good.  We had burger, beef dog and corn dog sliders.  One bite of each was the extent of what we could eat cause one more distasteful than the other.  Hawaiian bread didn't make up for less than awful taste.  Only good thing was manager refunded for the sliders...not the tater tots I just realized from my refund check.  However, not a good experience and will never return.< /text>< rate>

The mule burger was amazing, and very very messy. The Thai currywurst sliced sausage had great flavor and was spicy enough to make me feel alive.

Def recommend this place as a quick savory bite to eat. Cool atmosphere and decent prices too.

Pictured Thai Currywurst. Mule was so good and so messy I couldn't put it down.</Review>< Pics>

Dogs and burgers are good, but beware of promotions, they are misleading. Ask for specific details before ordering or you'll be screwed.<//Text>

Dog Haus has become my go to place for hotdogs. I just love how their hotdogs taste with their Hawaiian bread buns.

You can customize your hotdog with the many different toppings they have or you can just order one of their specialty hotdogs. My favorite is the downtown dog and fries with bacon and egg on top. It's so good!

If hotdogs is not your thing, they also have burgers and sliders that you can order.< /Text>

I own a restaurant and if my employees close 10 minutes before my posted time they would be replaced not only that they stood and watched me wait to order for 4 minutes before they told me they were closed honestly we have about 35 potential customers in a 1 mile radius we will drive to Topanga next time thanks for nothing<//Review>

{'time': 1563398784936, 'text': 'Hey Kenneth,\n\nOur items may cost a bit more than those you can get a fast food restaurant, big box retailer, street vendor, or convenience store, but those type of businesses don’t offer the proprietary recipe dogs and sausages, signature flavor profiles, high quality ingredients, made to order items or dining experience as Dog Haus.\n\nWe’re proud of our food, and we source the best possible ingredients to make it, such as 100% genetically tested Black Angus beef from Creekstone Farms that is certified humanely raised, vegetarian fed and free of all hormones and antibiotics. We also serve vegetarian fed poultry and Premium Iowa Pork, both of which are hormone- and antibiotic-free. Our mission to serve the highest quality food includes nitrate-free sausages and hot dogs that are free of all added nitrates and nitrites. What’s more, all of our dogs and sausages are made exclusively for Dog Haus by our Würstmacher, Adam Gertler, using proprietary recipes.'}< /response>
