They had so many retro candies and the food was CHEAP and tasty!! They have a January deal for $6.99 and you get a spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and a 32 oz drink!<//Text>

<Text>Customer service is superb, thanks to the blonde morning cashier. I ordered the double cheeseburger with Xtra grilled onions and light condiments and upgraded to the combo fries with any size drink.  Spent under $10 and the burger was fatty! Had to be a 1lb+. The fries could use some work for they were your average crinkle cut. There's nothing really negative about my experience. Great team, great food and I have recommended it to several friends. ** Perfect bread to meat ratio**</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

There food is amazing. But they are so slow! I always call in my order and ask them how long it will take. They always say, “oh it will be quick, 10 min no problem” I still give them double the amount of time and when I get there I wait another 10-20 min.</text>

<review>This place is amazingly delicious! The burgers are great! The fries are delicious but a bit salty (sometimes). Make sure you tell them to add light salt. You can order ahead! Open 24 hours!! They have a soda machine that has many options! They are friendly and always ready to get your order. They also have ketchup, mustard, ranch, and relish (Heinz) packets! Not pricy at all!
The store has just about everything you need inside! So much retro candy as well. Yes, they have alcohol and ice cream. Definitely add it to your burger list!<//review>< time>

Gas prices and what ever u may need inside the mini Mart are  always over priced. But if it's a bite to eat you've stopped for prices are very reasonable and they have daily & monthly food specials. This little gem always serves up something tasty to eat!<//Review>

If you only have 30min for lunch which includes your drive time, phone your order in ahead of time.  But, if you have a full lunch hour, the prices are great, the food is great, and the classic diner feel is wonderful.< /review>< Pics>

Open 24 hours. Convenient store that sells a lot of neat throwback candies, pastries, etc. One of the best and only place (besides Denny's and Ihop, etc) you can walk in, sit, and eat food that's cooked when ordered, any time, at a good price. They also have awesome milkshakes.</Review>

They have a great product but the staff can be very lazy and they hate making shakes. I work near by and I go there a lot. Lately they find every excuse in the book to not make a shake. Because of that, myself and my coworkers are not going there anymore.<//Review>

<Review>The 1 pound burger they have for sale on Wednesdays is absolutely worth it, and easily worth more than the $5 I paid for it.

The one mistake I made was not pacing myself and eating too much too quickly.

The place is kept really clean as well, and has lots of 50s kitsch to keep you entertained while you eat.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

The food here is made to order 24/7! Drunk at 3 a.m.? Hungover at 1 p.m.? Need a juicy 1/3-lb hamburger to make it all better? Then this is your spot. 4 stars because sometimes the skinny guy behind the counter can be a jackass.</Review>

First time here we came for shakes. Cookies and cream was ok. Mint shake was awesome! We came again and got a burger which was really good. Big patty that tasted really good. Also got the chicken strips that were equally as delicious.<//Text>

They dont deserve 1 star at all super unprofessional , non-reliable. The lady told me to come back Wednesday after speaking with her on monday and she was not in the office and had not called the irs yet to get my tax return . She left a message with her co-worker for me and did not even bother to call me her self or send text nor email .<//review>

This was our first time meeting Geoffry and we were comfortable with him right off the bat. Considering the anxiety of having to change our tax person after 4 years. We look forward to working with him in the coming years.</Text>

<review>Since switching to H&R Block from using TurboTax I have been able to earn more credits and I have the peace of mind that everything is being done correctly.

<username>Don Sherman</username><Review>Exploited my elderly parents. My honest and ageing parents had H&R Block prepare their taxes. Once H&R Block had intimate knowledge of their financial situation, knowledge of their savings, income and expenses, H&R Block found it beneficial to provide them a loan in anticipation of their tax refund. H&R Block did not perform in a fiduciary manner. My parents had all their bills fully paid and had more than one-hundred and fifty thousand dollars in their savings. As elderly people, their thinking process’s had declined and there was absolutely no reason to take an exhorbiant interest  loan using their tax refund. Do NOT use H&R Block for your tax preparation and share this review with any persons in need of income tax preparation.< /Review><UserId.>104078465552887707879< /UserId.>< pics>

I've heard that it's a good place to start at, that's it. Trying to get ahold of ANYONE in charge there is a lost cause. Trying to report baseballs hitting our cars in the neighborhood from their baseball practice, reporting student cars parked in front of my driveway, and now trying to get anything done about the excessively loud music played while their baseball practice is going on....no one responds. The neighbors and I can hear the music from six houses down across the street....and from inside our homes!!! Their coaches clearly are not concerned about teaching any moral values or respect.< /text>

They offer in person, online, or a little of both to fit your schedule. Bakersfield College is filled with people who are ready and willing to help you achieve your educational goals, and have campuses throughout Kern County.

< Review>
Looking back, I realize that BC is one of the best Community Colleges in CA. Yes, it's imperfect. But there is opportunity here for those who aren't quite sure what path they want to follow. I was the first in my family to ever attend college. I wasn't ready, but BC allowed me to learn how to study, to prepare for the rigors of four-year college. Most of the classes I took here transferred to the Univ. of CA, where I finished my B.S. in 5.5 years total. After that, I earned my doctorate from the Univ. of Arizona and did cancer research. My point is: it's okay to "start small", because it's where your journey takes you that really matters.</Review>

Great educators! Wonderful environment I never had an issue everyone was always helpful. BPD even go around and leave you notes on your vehicle if you left your car unlocked or if you left valuables visible they work great with the public safety department and make the entire campus welcoming.< /review>

<resp>None< /resp><review>This would be my second year at BC and the first year was okay. The staff wasnt the nicest but i got by. The second year has been nothing but trouble. The counselors aren't helpful and I'm 5 weeks into the semester and they have yet to give me my financial aid. I've called left emails gone in and they keep telling me that I need to wait because they fell behind. Why should I have to wait because you cant figure it out? Financial aid is supposed to help us pay for these expensive books and movies and online websites that you make us pay for. How does that help when the money wont come until the end of the semester? The financial aid staff was nothing but rude and did not try to even help me understand and then got angry with me when I showed distress. Overall not happy. This isnt the college for you if you are counting on receiving financial aid.< /review>< Date>

I've had a great experience at BC. You can only fail if you don't help yourself. Professors have been great. Yes staff is stressed usually but that is because of the high volume of students. If you want to succeed you will. If you fail thats your own damn fault.< /Text>

< Review>
So far the instructors i have had are great but the damn school itself sucks ass milking students for their damn money! Great example that i just noticed today all along the side of the campus by the bluffs it was okay to park there during the spring semester now im not sure if the city had the NO PARKING ANYTIME signs put up or the school had it put up and even if the city did put them up its completely rude that the school didn't try to fight to leave that parking area available for students that cannot afford the schools super OVERPRICED parking permits for a community college especially right here in bakersfield! I have been buying the parking permits because i can afford it but it makes me mad that students are almost being forced to buy the damn parking permit or park a mile away and even then still have the residents around the school make complaints about students parking there.< /Review>

My jr college years were great. Quality education is one of the best in California.
You can see a lot of structure improvements throughout the campus.
Make parking accesible to everyone.<//Review>

Terrible experience from before I even enrolled. Expect to get half-assed help from fellow student workers . Expect to get a cold and douche bag response from Nicky Damania when handling serious issues. I especially loved my professors getting mixed up about textbooks and getting accidentally dropped from one of my classes! There is no organization in this college! Counselors will sign you up for classes you may not even need for a major that may not even be yours. All around mess. EOPS is a god damn joke.  Money money Money!!< /Review>

The campus is too big, classes too big, teachers are lazy, counselors don't know what they're doing, and this place is a black hole. You start but never finish. I transferred to Taft College and had a much better experience.</review>

I actually was in attendance the night Memorial Stadium opened in 1954.  People weren't used to traffic conditions and many ended up being late not having timed it properly.  The 'Gades used to play their games at Griffith Stadium and I saw a Potato Bowl game there in 1953 against Compton College.  I haven't been there in over 25 years but the games were always sold out during the years I lived in Bakersfield .  It was a bit sad for me when I had the chance to go to game in 1987 and the attendance was very low. I only attended for a semester in the mid-sixties but it was pretty good at that time.< /review>

It's my first and only college so far but this place has been great. I am one class away from graduating and could not have done it if not for the amazing scholarship and financial aid opportunities provided through FASFA, the college, and local sponsors. The professors are great for the most part and the online class options work wonderfully around my hectic work schedule. The campus is very large and parking can mean a long walk. Only concern is safety due to the surrounding areas and increased crime in our city, but the school promptly notifies students by email of local reported incidents on and off campus to keep you informed. I'm so glad I chose this school as my first college. Thank you BC!<//Review>

<Review>Financial Aid office often cause a lot of trouble and hardly help resolve it. Couple of rude students and there's always car break-ins, drunks in the library, and creeps walking up to students. **I once faced a student who wanted to offer me a job and he wouldn't tell me any details about it but he really wanted me to meet him downtown so that he could interview me. I declined his offer from how sketchy it sounded.** There's often annoying people on campus asking you to sign petitions and will harass you about it. The supplies in the book store are doubled the cost than what you find at Walmart but only go there for scantrons and bluebooks. The only plus side about this school is the professors. There are some professors that care enough about your wellbeing.< /Review>< gmap_id>

So unbelievably dissatisfied with the customer service of this school. If they had the a ability BC would let you drown intentionally. They are not here to help you at all. Their online system doesn't always work, and when you call to get help with something, no matter what department you call NO ONE ANSWERS. And if they do answer, they don't know how to help and transfer you to someone who will not answer their phone.  Bottom line, Go to Taft college. I have many friends and my mom who enjoyed thier experience with Taft.<//Review>

the campus is quite nice and large. the issue I have here is the service to students. There is an obvious lack of attention to service to students over the phone, even during non school hours when there is availiable staff that hardly have any students coming in for questions. Even in other campuses that I have went to the service was much better. If you're trying to.get help from genuine staff that care to help students this isnt the place, they are flawed immensely to providing you much help at your convenience. Either get more staff Bakersfield College or make some major changes in how you provide your service, because what you are doing isnt working!< /text>

This place is hell. Youre stuck in a room with 55 students and the class only can hold 35 people. Which you'll be standing or sitting on somebody lap. The teachers dont care if you pass our not. I don't like This experience at all. Then good percent of students who you get partner up with most likely tell you they have a bf or gf. Which how the hell are you suppose to do a group project when no one want to give you there number to do the damn groups project. I ended up doing the project alone and the rest of them got and A. Thank to me. Never ever want to be at this school.<//review>

Worst school EVER!!!!!!! I graduated from here with a 2.78 GPA and I had the worst experience here. This school has a mess of problems ranging from incompetent staff, professors with an agenda pushing propaganda, failure to process materials by state deadlines, horrible construction practices leading to numerous detours. Please by all means avoid this school like the plague that it is. This school should be shut down.....it deserves to be.<//text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>The only reason I gave this one star is because zero isn't an option. I can't believe the amount of incompetency and absolute uselessness, not to mention indifference, that I was met with first time I've ever interacted with this school. Don't let the four or five star reviews fool you. This school is out for one reason and one reason only: to make as much money as possible at the expense of those that have no other choice. While this may not encompass all of BC's teaching staff, who are unfortunately brought down by the greedy administration, it does reflect your future experience if you are unfortunately enrolled in any classes here. For some, Bakersfield College is their only option given their circumstances. The administration feeds off of this. I am lucky enough that I have a choice, and I will most definitely not waste it on a school that could not care less about the well-being or future of their students.</review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) No good tha service is very bad. They never have a truck and the workers spend it smoking in front of the gas bubbles, that only reflects the responsibility of this negosio, the prisoner is fine but just looking at the workers smoking outside, I don't come back

(Original)
No good tha service is very bad. Nunca tienen camvio y los trabajadores se la pasan fumando enfrente de las pompas del gas eso solo refreja la inresponsavilidad de este negosio el presio esta vien pero nomas por mirar a los trabajadores fumando afuera yo ya no regreso</review>

(Translated by Google) I love because the prices are good
And clean they have clean breezes and paper to clean your glasses and gives you your gas

<text>We were so impressed with the professionalism and courtesy CBX Roofing provided us. CBX was the first company that told us we had a 40 year roof. Even though there were many places of dry rot, Robert assured us everything would be fine. They replaced all the bad plywood quickly and efficiently even in the hottest week of the year. It was amazing to see how fast they worked, answered all our questions and kept us posted all the way through the process. Robert and his crew were there for us when we needed them. We would definitely refer them to our family and friends. Thank you so much!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Review>David the Project Engineer was absolutely amazing. From start to finish he followed through with every detail and always available for questions. The work was done by his professional staff in a timely manner as promised. The crew was efficient and cleaned up all debris. They covered my pool and protected my trees and cleaned my gutters of loose debris when it was completed. I highly recommend David and his crew for an amazing job! Thank you Ben for getting me started as my first point of contact with my insurance company.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Tyler inspected my roof for hail damage. He was courteous and professional. I was pleasantly surprised to find out my insurance would cover a complete tear off and new roof because it was 22 years old and getting close to needing replaced anyway.
Robert was my project manager. He was very professional and also courteous. He was easy to get a hold of and happy to answer all of my questions. The job had to be rescheduled a couple times due to the weather, but no one can control the weather so that is completely understandable.
Workers showed up on time and worked hard. They were all friendly and kind. The job was finished in a timely manner and to my satisfaction. They cleaned up all the shingle scraps and I only found a couple nails they missed, but not in my tires, thank goodness!  The roof looks great and has no leaks. I am very happy with the new roof. I only had to pay the deductible for my insurance.
CBX made the whole process extremely easy for me. My insurance company called and asked me a few questions one time. Other than that, CBX did all the legwork and that made me extremely happy!<//review>< pics>

There’s was too much miscommunication on their part. Took them nearly 6 months to start and complete the work after said date. We even had to remind them to complete some other work as stated on our contract. After all was said and done we received a bill for an extra $10,000 for extra roof work they claimed had to be done. Makes sense to me that if an extra $10,000 worth of work needs to be done, that they let the homeowner know before beginning the work. Even so, we weren’t able to figure out how they calculated the extra $10,000. Were not rich here and our insurance company won’t cover whole amount charged. Turns out we’re not the only ones they’ve done this too. So, definitely look into all of your options.< /review>

CBX Roofs recently replaced the roof at the home of my mother.  We were fortunate to have Jeremy Robbins as the project manager. He was pleasant, knowledgeable and responded promptly if needed. Kudos to the roofing crew...they worked diligently during the summer heat.  They were thorough and they did a good job with the clean up. Only praises to CBX for a job well done!<//text>

David and his crew did an awesome job on our new roof. We love it! Due to my insurance company this project was a nightmare from the beginning. Phil and all of the office staff at CBX rolled up their sleeves and went to work advocating on our behalf. They were able to assist us in a manner like no other roofing company could! We greatly appreciated their efforts. Once approved, David and his crew went to work. They were all respectful, on time, and communicated with us during the entire process. Would not recommend any other roofing company other then CBX! We love our roof! Thanks to all.</Review>

<Review>I haven't used them YET, currently still in the process. David has been incredible. He's very detailed, communicative, responsive, and goes as far as doing check-ins to get updates from me. He asks questions and is very thorough. I love his attitude towards his job and he even mentioned the roofing crew is on a company team, so the family vibe goes past David onto his coworkers. He's always so bubbly and has been amazing to work with. I look forward to moving forward with the job! These guys are given a high recommendation from me. Thanks crew! And thanks David!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>CBX replaced our roof and did a great job. They did every thing that was promised when we signed the contract. The estimater, Tyler Chapman and project manager, Dave Hakes were outstanding. They were very professional and easy to work with. They both knew what had to be done and performed every thing in a timely manner. The crew was very well trained and worked fast and did a great job. They cleaned up very well and left the house and property in good condition when they were finished. I was very happy with the entire job.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

<text>While they do very good work. Miscommunication with the non English speaking crew, resulted in a few bumps. I was also told I would get a military discount; but it was listed nowhere in the contract for the part I had to pay for an upgrade. Cody was very knowledgeable and professional.<//text>< pictures>

My whole experience with CBX roofs was professional and personal from my first contact with Landon Wells, project lead, to the completion of my roof under the supervision of Robert Wessely. Robert kept me informed of each step of the project and worked well with his amazing, hard-working crew. Thanks for a job well-done!< /Text>

<Text>My experienced started when a CBX roof inspector arrived at my home and explained that my residence is located in an area that had experienced a severe hail storm.   The inspector told me that other homes in my area had experienced roof damage from this storm.  The inspector offered to inspect my roof for free, so I agreed to the inspection.  When the CBX inspector came back down from the roof he explained that he had located hail damage.  The CBX inspector suggested that I contact my insurance company regarding my hail damaged roof.

After a period of time had passed another CBX agent met with my insurance claims agent and they inspected my roof together.  Both men agreed that hail damage was evident on my roof, so the insurance claims agent started the approval process to replace my entire roof.

This week a CBX crew along with their supervisor, Robert Wessely replaced my roof.  The work performed by the roof crew was excellent.  The crew was extremely well organized,  and they were friendly.  Supervisor Wessely was excellent at coordinating the effort.  And he kept me informed of what to expect throughout the process.

I rate the job process performed by CBX  as being a top notch effort.< /Text><time>1626465837381< /time>< user>

So, really happy with CBX roofs and their team on the ground, they have done a great job with our roof replacement due to hail damage, and even negotiated with insurance to get our outbuildings included, which was not part of the original claim. Great leadership from Robert, and just an efficient and helpful company. I highly recommend them.< /Review>

<Text>I had two houses that CBX put new roofs on. From the initial contact with Landon and dealing with the two project managers Robert and Harrison was a pleasure. They both were very professional and always did what they promised. The crews they managed were unbelievable. Very hard workers. Got the two large homes completed in two days. No mess left behind. I highly recommend CBX< /Text></record>

I & my wife would like to say thank you to CBX Roofs Company, David Hakes the project Engineer & staff for helping replace my roof after some storm damage ( Hail ) & dealing W/My home owners Insurance. They were very courteous & answered any & all concerns which I had on a few occasions. I would highly recommend this company to any who are needing new or replace roof.

<text>We had your roof replaced by CBX Redding last year. They did such a great job! Jeremy Robbins took care of us from beginning, all the way to the quality check at the end. The crew that worked on our roof was incredible. The hardest working group of guys I've ever seen, even in the 105+ degree heat. Our roof looks great and we are very satisfied customers.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x54d2ed84f4f02a4d:0x700f194ced4f0d17</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was so impressed with Robert and his crew. They tore off 2 roofs and replaced them in 4 days. Robert was great, he kept me posted on all things pertaining to the roof all the way through. I was very impressed with everything they did. And that crew,WOW!<//review>

CBX roofs did an amazing job replacing our roof due to hail damage. They coordinated with my insurance and made it extremely easy.
They showed up on time and the crew were really nice and professional. They finished ahead of schedule and left our property spotless.
I honestly have nothing negative to say.
I highly recommend them and definitely would use them again.</Text>

<Text>CBX just finished replacing our roof that was damaged from the hail storm in 2019.
They handled the claim with our insurance company from start to finish. They pulled the necessary permits from the city. They are also handling the minor repairs needed to pass final inspection.
They walked us through the whole process so we knew exactly what to expect.
Completed the job right on schedule.< /Text><UserId.>107722311769922490479<//UserId.>< rating>

CBX Roofs is absolutely fantastic.  Cody Lucero was the project engineer and he was super professional, friendly, responsive & all about customer service.  We had the same experience with his associate Dave, who visited the house in person when we had a question.  The installation crew was great, respectful of the property, cleaned up well after, etc.  I wholeheartedly recommend this company!!< /text>

I wanted so badly to give them 5 stars because for the most part the roof looks great. However a couple of snags I ran into and I feel they can potentially help. First, the sales rep made it a point to push me towards an energy efficient shingle these were all lighter colored shingles and definitely would not have been my first choice but I did what the guy was telling me I should do. I ended up picking the darkest energy efficient shingle they had but it was still very very light. I was Then told literally as my roof was being done that they are all energy efficient and I could have went as dark as I would have liked. 🤦🏻‍♀️ imagine how frustrating that was for me. I mean it’s a roof it has a job to do and doesn’t need to be esthetically pleasing however I would have preferred a darker shingle. Next is I can never get anyone on the phone for this company, it always goes to voicemail. I have had zero correspondence with them since my roof was placed about 2 months ago and I have called a couple times now. I am sitting here with a supplemental check from my insurance company and have no idea how I’m supposed to pay them. The people I spoke with are great. It was quality work. I just hope they reach out to me soon.< /Review>

The crew was very professional. They were kind and honest. They cleaned up after they were done. We had to have the old roof removed and a new one put on. When they left it was very clean and we were very happy. Easy to communicate with. I would recommend them to anyone.<//review>

<Review>I have to let you know how much I appreciated your company. The crews that worked on my roof were very professional. Even though their was a slight language barrier, they never got upset with me if I didn’t understand the answer. We just kept trying until we both understood.  I would have that crew work for me again. I loved how we both tried to understand each other. If everyone else in this world would try this hard, there would never be any more hatred for people who are different. I love all God’s children.< /Review>< Pictures>

I couldn’t thank the upper management and bosses enough for everything they do for us employees. They treat everyone at CBX like family and go over and above on everything they do for us and the community. Thank you CBX and for giving me the opportunity to be a part of such an amazing company!

These guys were great!  Our project manager was very professional the tear off crew had the roof off and cleaned up in 2 hours and Ron and Bob were excellent at the repairs and new roof installation.  I reccomend CBX for anyone needing a roof.  Excellent company.</review>

<Text>Robert and his crew were always the upmost professional, polite and extremely hard working. Robert and his crew took time to make sure every detail on roof and also on the ground level looked exceptional every day they were here. They really made a lasting impression with us. I will refer them to everyone I run across that needs roofing.</Text>< Pictures>

I would recommend CBX Roofs to anyone who needs a roof replacement or repair. The Crew Leader "Robert" was excellent in his response of any questions or concerns I had, his Crew respected him and followed his directions. The Crew did a outstanding job. My roof was complicated with Hips and Valleys and was a complete tear off and replacement, they still did the job within two days! I was shocked to say the least. I had many questions about the work and how cleanup was to be done etc... It was all done with Roberts help in that time frame. I am super happy with my roof, I admire it everytime I come and go from my house.
A final note being that there are always some type of issues that arise on a job like this and the best way I found was to let Robert or any good Crew Leader know right away and it will be taken care of instead waiting until the job is done and everyone is gone. Thanks CBX Roofs...<//review>

We had damage to our roof caused by a hail storm.  The original adjuster that our insurance company sent only inspected the roof from the ground and stated that there was not enough damage to warrant repair funds. We called CBX and they did a thorough inspection of our roof and found quite a bit of damage.  They provided an estimate and worked with our insurance company to cover the replacement of our entire roof because of the extensive damage caused by the storm.

Scott was assigned as our manager and that was a HUGE mistake and one that I will not go into as I was told that the situation was taken care of.  Due to construction related issues and zero communication from our manager, I had all but given up hope and we were going to have to take legal action. I made one last attempt and finally spoke to Brad in the office. I instantly began to calm down as he seemed genuinely concerned and embarrassed for what seemed to be our ongoing nightmare. He scheduled an appointment for that day and was on the phone with his quality department while he was speaking with me!

A few days later another Brad made contact and made an appointment to have all of our concerns addressed and fixed. As promised Brad and another worker, Jeremy showed up, told us in detail what it was that they were going to do and how long it would take. Truth was I was holding my breath the entire time and simply didn’t need to!  The professionalism that both Brad and Jeremy showed was amazing!  As they stated, they were done on time and maintained a very clean work environment.

A few days later, Brad from the office called to make sure there was nothing left to finish up.  Brad, Jeremy and Brad definitely went the extra mile for us after a bumpy start.<//Review>< pictures>

Everything went great from scheduling time for CBX to come out and to put on our new roof. I was pleasantly surprised when they were able to remove my existing roof and with in 3 days we had a beautiful brand new roof! Shout out to Cody who ran our project and "The Brads" who followed up with us when we had some questions. WOW that was a lot of hair!!!

We called other companies in town with one stating that it would be over a year before they could come out! I didn't want to Wait...
I am happy to report that it has since rained a few weeks ago and there was no more leaking!

Over all I am very happy with the work they did. I would absolutely hire them again and will highly recommend them to all my neighbors and friends.< /text>

CBX Roofs inspected my roof and provided an estimate in November.  I gave them a deposit and was told that work should begin in early spring.  At the start of March they called to schedule the replacement for the last week in March.  They verified all the project specifications, and told me that my project manager would contact me the weekend before work was to start.  Sure enough, my project manager Robert Wessely called me on the Saturday before the project was going to start to finalize all the details and give me a timeframe.  His crew arrived right on time and did a tremendous job, completing the replacement in 3 days.  During those 3 days, Robert communicated the status of the project as well as expectations of inspections.  On the third day, the roof was finished, the entire area around my house was spotless and the crew left no trace that they were even there.  The entire process was smoother than I could have anticipated.  I would highly recommend CBX Roofs, Robert Wessely, and his crew for your roofing needs.< /text>

<Review>Robert is a true professional. He always kept us informed of what was being done and when. We have a large roof that has lots of skylights. His crew had everything completely done in 4 days. His crew worked really hard and were very professional as well. I would recommend them to anyone.< /Review>< Pictures>

Dylan did a great job communicating with us and our insurance to explain how everything would go.

Robert and his crew were awesome, very respectful, patient, on time and thorough. Our roof looks amazing and they got it done faster than we had anticipated. I wouldn't recommend any other company, but CBX Roofs.</review>

David and his crew from CBX were fantastic ! They did a professional job and got it done in 3 days including the inspection. I needed few extra jacks and vents they did what I asked and more. I always try to do business with local company's and CBX with their team is one I will come back to anytime I have need. Great job guy's !< /text>

<Text>Last fall I was told March at the earliest.  Since Feb was such nice weather I called Jeff and said how about it.....??  He put it together and on March 1st, a couple crews were back in town and came to St Charles.  They did four houses in four days,  some times helping each other out to get them all done.  After joking and smiling with some of the guys they loosen up a little and they seem to be having fun at it. A couple 12 packs of Corona and some citrus at the end of the job brings some pretty big smiles from them.  Communication was good with project manager and billing staff and the whole experience was positive, and as far as I can tell the job was done right, and it looks great.  Thanks CBX Jeff, Brad and Adam.  I'd recommend CBX to anyone looking for a roof.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

I recommend CBX Roofing to everyone in and around Redding. When David from CBX arrived at my house in early December we were supposed to have our roof completed within a few days. But then a series of unfortunate and unforeseen events ensued that kept the project from being completed until mid-January. So how does CBX rate so highly on a project that took longer than originally expected? I could go on and on about how great our experience with CBX was, but I will keep it to three main reasons.

First, when the old roof was removed they found a dangerous configuration of illegal wiring that had been installed many years ago by the previous homeowner. CBX worked with the city on our behalf to ensure that the future design was up to code and, more importantly, safe for my family. They also coordinated with our insurance company to get an electrician to bid the project as quickly as possible. But then the rains came. For those of you in this part of the country, you understand our rainy season is quite unpredictable but pretty consistently wet through December and January. We knew we would be roofless for much longer than we wanted. We were nervous, but this was the second time that CBX rose to the occasion. David and team sprang into action and made sure our roof was tarped to protect us from the crazy wind and rain we experienced over the course of 3-4 weeks. During that time we had a couple of leaks (water always finds a way in), but each time it happened David was onsite to readjust or add a layer of tarp to prevent any actual damage, one time even at 6:45 on a Sunday morning. But the CBX team didn’t stop there. The third house-saving/money-saving/life-saving/marriage-saving moment came when the CBX office went to bat for us with our insurance claim. They fought for us and ended up saving us thousands of dollars because of their understanding of claims, codes, and the overall insurance process.

This could have been a nightmare experience, but with CBX it was merely a little bump in the road. The entire team we interacted with: Dan, Bob, Ron, McNeal, and Jeremy to name a few… everyone involved was friendly, professional, hard-working, and helpful. If you want someone to make sure that your roof not only gets done right, but also that you will have an excellent experience from start to finish, then call CBX. I am sure all of the Project Managers are great there, too, but if I were you I would specifically ask for David. For us he was the difference. He kept us informed, he was always accessible (sorry for all the calls and texts, David), and he even made sure my children kept their distance from any nails on the ground (which his team soon picked once they got off the roof!).</review>

<Text>CBX ROOFERS are TOP DOGS of roofers.  Watched other roofers in the neighborhood replacing hail damaged roofs, CBX blows them off.  CBX ROOFING team Landon, Project Lead and David, Project Engineer, and Team, knocked it out of the park. After Landon's initial inspection and estimate and color choice. They showed up a month early!  Did the tear off one day, called for the county inspection the next day, the crew installed the new roof the next day  complete..  The job was complete in three days, just waiting for the final.  Roof looks GREAT!  Quality installation. Professional work by the CBX ROOFING TEAM!!!! Just paid the insurance deductible. THANKS SO MUCH!  MICK & COLLEEN</Text>< name>

Can’t say enough about CBX and what a great job they did for me. They did what they said they would and even finished quicker then expected.  Great experience and I’ll use them for any other roofing needs I have in the future.<//text>

<review>The roofers were supposed to come at 10:30AM to begin repairs. We appreciated the later start time because my husband works late nights and needs to sleep in. They arrived at 6:30AM the first day, and 7:00AM the second day. Both days they let my dog out of the yard and my husband found our dog in the middle of the street.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< user>

Not only is the job fantastic but I have never met such giving people. The generosity this company has had with Redding is mind blowing. Chad,Troy and Jarred have made Redding their home. I can’t thank you Cbx enough. We are all one big family here !< /Text>< pictures>

We had CBX replace our roof after a hail storm here in town. They were very responsive at the beginning when they were trying to acquire our business. After we signed the contract it all changed. I had called several times to get the schedule date and did not have anyone call me back after several calls. When I finally heard from them and received a date, we scheduled a few days before I left for vacation so that I could be home for the project. I had a large dog that would not have behaved well with them working and I wanted to be there to keep the dog from barking etc. They call me a couple of days before the start date and they had to push the project back. I wasn't happy but I understood. They completed the project within a few days. It took several weeks for the final inspection to come back. When they finally charged me it was much more than the original insurance approved amount. The original quote was $14,000 and the final bill was $21,000. My insurance ended up not covering all of it and money I was given for other hail damage repairs went to the roof bill. I was trying to work out the details with my insurance company to see if they would cover more as I was having to pay more than my deductible. Suddenly I heard from CBX all the time requesting payment. When I needed to get ahold of someone I never heard anything but when money was due they were contacting me often. I had a small portion of the final bill that was due after insurance basically told me I should have shopped around for pricing. I sent an email to the bill employee after I made a partial payment that I would pay the remaining balance in a few weeks. She said that was great. About a week later I get a notice in the mail that a lien was placed on my house. No warning at all. I could have found a way to pay this had I known this was going to be happening. My parents who had 2 roofs done by them received a lien as well around the same time frame. It understand the need to collect payment but I feel the customer service was lacking the entire time. A little notice would have been great. I highly recommend anyone looking to get a roof done by cbx to weigh other options. I know other people that had good quality roofs done with less headaches for much cheaper.< /Text>

He worked closely with our insurance company to make sure absolutely everything was taken care of quickly.  Harrison was very responsive and is an outstanding communicator.

< Review>
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!  They are from out of the area and do not care about building a business!!  My quote for the roof was originally 15,000 and then ended up being 25,000!!  My house is only 1,400 sq ft... The office was very unhelpful and would not tell me why the roof cost 10,000 more then the original quote.  They said my original quote was the bare bones.

The workers were smoking cigarettes on my front porch, they were drinking beer before they were completely off my roof and off my property. While they removed the roof they were so ruff that they messed up the covers of the vents on the inside and we had pieces of roof in our house.

All around pour business conduct.  Go with Tugwell or someone who is local and wants referrals!< /Review>

Review # 1 (first impression)
Put in a request for an inspection and was answered by Parker in less than 24 hours, set up the appointment easily. Parker was on time and answered my questions to my satisfaction about the process,  how they work with city inspections, what type of code requirements I can expect  and what my out of pocket expenses would be. I am happy that CBX will take the whole project on, working with my insurance and getting my roof replaced.

Review #2 (Job well done)
So now it is April 2020 and the roof is finished.  I was told that due to the backlog of roofing jobs in my area and weather it would take this long to get it done so no problem with the wait, also having someone from CBX touching base with me from time to time really helped me know they were working towards getting the job done.

David, my project manager made sure I knew what to expect, kept me informed as to the timeline / process and made sure I was informed as the project progressed. Naturally there were some issues with my roof, rotten sheathing, repairs to be done. These issues were handled quickly and professionally. David called and explained the issues prior to the repairs without trying to pressure me into additional expenses and worked with me along the way. David gained my trust by overseeing the completion of the job and making sure it was a quality job. The whole crew was very friendly and professional, which in my opinion reflects on Davids leadership.

As a maintenance supervisor, I am very satisfied with the completed job and recommend CBX roofing.< /review>

We needed our roof fixed after the hail storm sure CBX was quick to respond and come out. They gave us a good quote and even promised us gutters. We were sold. Instead CBX put the wrong plywood on the over hangs, they ran it the wrong way, they promised us gutters never gave us new ones while in the process they  dented our old ones and now they don't want to fix it right.

<text>Due to Hail damage back in May of 2019, we were able to submit a claim through our home insurance (AAA) to help us replace our roof because of the damage due to the hail storm. The ball started rolling once I made that call to AAA. I would like to thank Sky Larkin and Daniel Brooks from AAA. I would like to thank Alexander Lyons and David Hakes from CBX roofing. Our roof is beautiful and we couldn't have asked for a better company to work with. I would highly recommend CPB Roofing!!! Good job guys!<//text>< Rating>

CBX installed our roof and did a great job. They went beyond expectation. Robert was the crew lead and stayed in contact with me  through the process. They covered a few items additionally at no cost. I walked the roof upon completion with Robert and the work was solid. A few minor points need to be revisited, but they were handled in less than 24 hours. We're happy and would certainly recommend CBX to anyone shopping for roof replacement.< /Review>

CBX roofs just finished my roof. They did a fabulous job. It looks great and the clean up was amazing. Doesn’t even look like anyone was here.  Robert Westly was great to work with, always kept me informed of what was happening and what the next step was.  Thank you so much for the fast service.<//review>

Ben has been very help full with my claim. Very understanding and has had commuting the job at hand. He is very personal with me with the claim for my roof. Couldn’t ask for a better person for the job at hand. He is very out going in helping me with my problem with my insurance. My insurance carrier is going to drop my insurance soon. I can’t get another carrier till my claim is done on my roof.  Ben is doing all he can to get the job done for my so my insurance don’t laps. I appreciate all the effort that he has done. He stays in contact with me and let’s me know what’s going on with the work at hand. I would recommend Ben as a straight forward person and does all he can at the job at hand. Thank you been will recommend you for other jobs in my neighborhoods.</Text>

Didn't show up for our scheduled appointment on a Friday that I rushed home from work specifically for. No call or show for 4 days after. Finally received a call from inspection later that next week explaining they wanted to reschedule. I would of understood if you would have called that evening and said they couldn't make it but 4 days after no excuse!< /review>

The inly complaint, but not really was that there were a lot of nails and debris left for us to find and pick up. Considering all they did pick up, that was not a huge concern.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Then, when done, they did two follow ups to make sure all was done and no trash left.

CBX replaced our roof due to hail damage. Ray was the initial contact who met with our adjuster. Colton directed the team that completed the work in a couple of days.  Both were easy to work with and very committed to our satisfaction.  They suggested a couple of  upgrades and our roof looks amazing.</Review>

<Text>Not exactly sure how this company rated a 5/5. The only reason I'm giving them a one is it won't allow you to comment otherwise. I called them as a courtesy to my neighbor who works there to get an estimate for a  new roof. I have had (4) NO CALL - NO SHOWS with them after them setting appointments with me. FRUSTRATING to say the least. I had to call them each time and then when (Jay) the man that was supposed to show was forced to call me after I called the office I got an ear full of "F-bombs" with the apology. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! So much for trying to do a good neighborly gesture! Moving On!!< /Text>< date>

I had a new roof done in Feb due to the last severe hail storm in Redding. CBX completed the roof in only three days and i couldnt be happier with the service and professionalism i received from Robert and his crew. Robert took the time to come to the house (several times each day) to check on me and his crew. I like that! Nice doing business with you guys.<//text>

Well I set an appointment because I noticed the color of a room in my neighborhood I liked.  Appt. 10:30 no show...called office at 11:00 gave them my name, #, address - 3 times....she said she would send someone out...I said I had an appointment at 1pm so needed someone fairly quickly.  Someone called 1 hour later - said he got the wrong address and he was on his way.  I said why didn't you call me - didn't have my number - why didn't you call the office an hour and 1/2 ago for my phone # and address.
Then he repeated my address wrongly...I said I didn't have a good feeling about this...I used to be a sale rep and I really wouldn't handle this way.  He said haven't you ever gotten the wrong information from your office -yes but I called right away...He waited 1 1/2 hour to call me.  I asked if he had the samples I asked for - I was interested in lighter color one...all he had was darker color....You know this really wasn't going well.  I thought I would give them a chance and ask to speak to a manager - to get someone more experienced out to my home...at this point I really didn't trust what this person would write for an estimate.  I called the office asked for a manager - why - I'm a disgruntled maybe soon to be customer..we don't have any managers - just us in the office.  Hold on I may have someone that can' help you...is he a manager...pause, yes.
Are you a manager...pause...yes...whats your name , gives me first name, whats your last name.  I need to know who I'm talking to before I give you my last name.  Well, for a manager not to give me his name, not a manager.  IF I HAD THIS MUCH TROUBLE TRYING TO GET TO A MANAGER, HOW DO YOU THINK I WOULD DO IN A YEAR, AFTER I HAVE PAID THEM FOR MY ROOF.......BIG LESSON...I WILL BUY LOCAL!!!</Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Last May (2019) our home sustained significant roof damage when a big storm blew through Redding.  I contacted Triston Spinks of CBX Roofs (Project Lead and Estimator) to inspect the roof while I initiated a claim with my insurance company.  He worked closely with our insurance adjuster to make sure the damage assessment was complete and accurate.  His experience, knowledge, AND persistence with the adjuster resulted in authorization for a complete re-roof.  Triston was highly responsive and he approached this estimate professionally, with enthusiasm, and he is an exceptional communicator.  His dedication to providing the best customer service made this project possible.  Thank you Triston and CBX Roofs for your commitment to quality by delivering a beautiful and exceptional new roof!<//Review>

< Review>
CAUTION:  If you have the Open Eave type of roof structure common in Redding,  CBX uses staples that penetrate completely through the wood causing splinters making repair and repaint necessary!!

This was not a problem with our original roofing.

CBX completed our 4800 sq ft hail damaged roof in approximately two days.

Reroofing with shingles makes a huge mess, but our property was cleaned beyond expectation at the end of the job.

The crew worked through 107 degree temps and spent very little time off the roof at at their beverage cooler.  The quality of the job almost met our expectation plus some and incorporated the new code requirements.

The cost was less than other local contractors and CBX handled the cost of the claim with our insurance company.  Painless for the homeowner.<//Review>

Walked into a really well decked out waiting room/gift shop. Loved that they had refreshments while you waited. Desiree was my person and she was so welcoming and friendly. I did my first hot stone massage and it was awesome! Also enjoyed reflexology massage as well. The changing room had these delicious chocolates! When I came out, the staff had brought out a lovely birthday surprise treat.....enjoyed a fruit tart while overlooking the golf course. I rarely give 5 stars as usually there is always room for improvement but for Spa Barona it was a stellar experience!! Can't wait to go back!< /Text>< pics>

One of the best spas I have ever been to. Customer service is top notch. Quiet, relaxing and enjoyable. Heidi is bar none the BEST massage therapist I have ever been to. I have been to massages around the world and she is number one! Julie is the most patient and friendly nail specialist! She is a perfectionist and if not done to her standards she redoes the nails. She paints like an artist! Try them, you will never want to go anywhere else!< /Review>

<review>Sara was professional, kind and thorough.  I loved everything about my facial!  My face looks amazing and she makes me wish I could have her prep my face everyday! The spa was equally beautiful and relaxing.  And all of the staff were especially kind and accommodating.  I'll be back. :)<//review></record>

<review>I have been extremely tense and stressed the past month, my boyfriend decided we needed to go get couples massages last minute. We called same day, hours prior and they were able to accommodate our request . I got the deep tissue massage and let me tell you it was wonderful ! So relaxing, they listened exactly what our needs where and I feel 100 times better. The staff is so kind and they provided us with great customer service ! I will definitely be going back there, well worth the money !<//review><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Fantastic service. I had the best haircut from Michelle, an excellent therapeutic massage from Dawn, and a relaxing facial from Sarah. The spa itself is very clean and comfortable, and they offer so many different services that you wouldn't think would be available at a casino/hotel spa.
I'll definitely go back the next time I visit Barona.<//Text>< rate>

<review>Great service took very good care of myself and my wife for a couples massage. I had Heidi and my wife had Esther they are both very caring and respectful of our needs to become less tense.  This was my wife's first massage so she went with the sweetest relaxation massage she is now addicted to massages when previously said she hated them. They really did a great job I would definitely recommend this to friends and family .</review>< response>

<Text>I found the Spa services and all the lovely and attentive specialists became the highlight of my stay at the Barona Resort.
My Oxygen  Facial with Vanessa has left my skin looking and feeling amazing. And days later the effects are being noticed.
I would highly recommend this Spa to everyone.
Thank you especially to Nancy.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I have had many massages but, not once did I ever feel so relaxed when massaged by Daniel. Unbelievable. I will wait for an opening.</review>

<review>I had a great experience here! I had a massage and facial the day after my birthday and they were both wonderful! And when I mentioned it was my birthday they very sweetly gave me a beautifully decorated plate of assorted pastries and chocolate covered strawberries! I had an awesome experience here.<//review>< response>

The only reason I didn't give the facility 5 stars is the lack of amenities (steam room,  jacuzzi, etc).

<review>Wow! What can I say? EXCELLENT, UNBELIEVABLE, SUPER!!! I have to admit, usually I leave the spa treatments, massages and all that stuff to my fiance. But she talked me into getting a couples massages amd I must say it was the greatest experirnce Ive ever had. The staff at Ambience Day Spa is excellent...beyond excellent. And the massage?? Oh wow!! Lets just say that I may have a new habit. They are truly professional and definitely worth it. Dont cheat yourself, Treat yourself! Give em a try.

< review>
Denise was sooo great. . I've only had 1 other massage at a high profile place and the experience was noooooo where near what I got here... I walked out of my massage feeling like I was walking on air, I was totally relaxed.. Cant wait to go back again.. Thx again Denise..

P.S. Monique at the desk is soooo very helpful and friendly.. All the staff here, gets two thumbs up<//review>

Hi Producers, have enjoyed your products for many years! Back when Al Radka used to spell it out! Really like the new handle design, makes for better control!</Review>

<text>You guys have not been the same since 2 years ago we own a small business and everytime we get a shipment their excuse is you guys are always out of stuff, it's like a routine now every week it's always something out of stock so I don't how a big company is always out of stuff or if the worker is just lazy to grab it, so yes if I can put a no star I would, because this is not ok when we run out and can't sell anything because supposedly you guys are always out of stuff I just don't get it.<//text>< Response>

Not only was it disgusting they allow people to use the color of their skin to dictate what the outcome of a situation is. I'd never recommend this place to anyone. They give people split days off and will never move u up unless u are related to someone</Review>< Pictures>

This place says you'll work some overtime, expect to work nearly 12+ hours a night. Be prepared to have supervisors edit your time card so you can work more without taking a second lunch. Beware of the vault department, don't talk to anybody and if you're harassed or threatened by certain vault employees don't alert management. Once you do, expect retaliation. Rumors will be spread about you, and expect to get suspended without pay. Don't work here, it's so poorly run, machines constantly breaking and cockroaches galore in the break room.<//review>

<Review>I grew up with this milk and I have seen the changes of design of the logo and milk packing. I love the fresh taste of the milk. I love the fact that the milk is from the Central Valley. Buying local is good! This milk is a gem of the Central Valley. The taste is still the same throughout these years. Keep it up!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Love the product but hate the packaging. I buy a lot of milk at Costco but the handles to grab the milk carton are really, really poorly designed. They should not be on the face of the carton but on the ends. Grabbing it by the face is so very awkward. This design flaw has bothered me for about a year. Costco’s older milk carrier had the handles on the end. Much more user friendly. Please, please redesign milk carton for the double gallon product. It’s actually a bigger deal than you might imagine.

We had been receiving weekly producer deliveries to our location for 15years in the Dinuba area. Now that Gregg is gone a guy named Christian Martinez took his place and stopped doing business with us without a word. We called Producers directly and they said we must deal with Mr. Martinez. When we called him he said we don't buy enough milk. Not only did he not tell us how much not enough is, we don't even get a chance to negotiate because he never attended an agreed upon meeting. We could have bought more but now Producers gets this review.< /Review>

< review>
Producer's is not a good neighbor or a company I trust.
The enlarging of their parking lot at 450 E. Belmont is a major invasion of an older neighborhood.  Producer's owner entered into a signed and notarized  agreement in allowing them to use the property as parking lot and  Producer's  would retain part to the historic buildings and maintain the property.  In the years of using the lot it has been allowed to deteriorate.  Now Producer's wants to enlarge the lot with more trucks and an additional entrance on Ferger Ave.
This sounds and looks like the old "bate and switch" con game.  I wonder is Hoppy would be happy with the attempt to further destroy a family neighborhood.< /review>

<Text>Con Artists. I passed one of your trucks, showing two cows in the grass. Your poor factory farm cows don’t know what grass is. Or grazing. What’s natural for cows. I bet you liars advertise “Natural”

Our cattle are incredibly happy and receive the best care possible – our farms are family owned and operated, and have a 100% rating with Validus Animal Welfare… we’re top rated in the nation!  While our farms may be larger in size, they are still handled with the caliber of care that you expect from the smallest and closest of family farms.  From free stall bedding that’s made twice daily, to ample fans and misters to keep our ladies cool during the warm Central Valley summers, to comfort paths to and from our milking parlor, to top-notch feed that’s grown and sourced locally and overseen by certified nutritionists… I have never seen happier cows that have received better care, and I personally grew up on a small family farm that raised cattle as well.  I hope you have a wonderful day, and thanks again for reaching out! –JF'}< /Resp>

I tried this place based on reviews. I should have listened to the 1 start review before mine. The Orange Chicken was hard as a rock. There was virtually no chicken, and all crispy outside. The Fried Rice was bland, and the Chow Mein was just gross. The Veggie Rolls were soggy. I wouldn't recommend this place. We'll stick with Panda Express.</Review>

Best Chinese food in San Diego if not entire Southern California. The people are friendly. The food is amazingly fresh. The fish the noodles!! Should be called Imperial Heaven. So good here.

Family owned for years. Great people. We know people that drive from LA just to eat here!< /text>

<Text>came here on the recommendation of a friend. prices are excellent, and the food was very good....orange chicken was some of the best i've ever had anywhere.  kung pao chicken, chow mein, and egg rolls were also very tasty. 👍
interior is small and sparse, but clean and tidy.
the asian couple, that i assume are the owners, were quite nice.
parking lot is terrible. it's way too tiny for the number of shops/customers and apparently 99% of the people that frequent that small strip mall have absolutely no idea how to drive or park. 😐 despite that, i would absolutely go back.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Excellent Chinese food.  In fact, this is favorite Chinese restaurant in San Diego and I have been to just about all of them.  The portions are large and the people are very friendly.  I have never eaten there but always place a large order for family to eat at home.  The portions are so large the rest lasts for days.   The chicken wings are unique and delicious.< /Review>

Today I stopped by and the health board had shut it down for VERMIN INFESTATION!

I tried this place based on 4.4 stars and other people saying it’s the best Chinese food... NOPE! It’s one of the worst I have ever had. Orange chicken was way too sweet and had weird taste. Even fried rice and noodles were terrible. They also confuse people by saying 2 item combo for $6 something but rice counts as one? You basically always have to pay $8 for two item plate. Just don’t go...<//text>

<review>They give large portions, but the food isn't good, well at least not the orange chicken, Kung pao , beef and broccoli, and noodles. 2 plates and 2 drinks almost $20, which isn't too bad if it's really good. I love food and not really even picky, but wouldn't recommend<//review>< Pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The customer service is very good until they speak to you in Spanish, do not want very tasty and up-to-date food and they serve very well. They do not accept credit cards. Oh! I only pay cash, but it doesn't matter. It is good to have cash handy for whatever

The coffee is pretty good, and the location is convenient in the mall. It's the best coffee in the mall.

However the baristas can be a bit rude (they seemed exhausted every time I visited) and that was a consistent trend. There's also better coffee in Palo Alto, so unless you're shopping in the mall I would recommend looking around.</Review>

<text>First time at this location. Easy ordering and an entire wall of pixel glass separation of the entire store front. Seems like a lot of people ordered ahead of time but we ordered there and it was easy and safe.

We ordered the New Orleans Ice Coffee and a pour over. The Ice coffee was made with oats milk and was really good! Would definitely get again.

Staff was very nice.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

the cocoa was a bit on the strong side bitter for my tastes, temperature could be a little hotter too. Service was good but on the slow side consider it was not too busy!< /text>

Smaller version of the Blue Bottle on University, but equally great coffee and liege waffles (yum!). The ambiance is clean and sleek, and the service is fast and nice.

The avocado toast was also super fresh, a little more on the citric side, but the seeded toast itself was delicious.

They also offer alternative milks like Oat (Oatly), almond and soy milks.</text>

<Text>Horrible, taste like I was drinking cleaning chemicals. Asked them to remake our coffees to hot chocolates and they generously did, but even the freaking hot chocolate tasted like kitchen cleaner.< /Text>< Resp>

Really good coffee. Clean and cool interior design. Always enjoy the natural light coming in from the cool skylights. A little short on seating capacity but overall a great place for coffee lovers.< /Text>

Love Blue Bottle coffee - afaik this is only the second Blue Bottle in the Bay area ( the larger one being on University Ave in Palo Alto).
This place is clean, simple, and brews just as great coffee. Complimented with delicious snacks and bites.
Coffee takes time to craft but worth it.< /Text>

Always hard to give people bad news about there cars and what they need but he was more than willing to help take some of the financial burden away and was very genuine about what th car was going to need...I appreciate the help and effort. The techs there were pretty fast and efficient considering the work I needed to have done. Thanks for everything all you guys at Evans tire and wheel s< /review>< pictures>

<text>Evans Tires did a great job outfitting my mom's car with new tires.  All pricing up front, great selection, appointment was easy to make, she was walked through everything on the phone and in person.  So courteous.  Super clean in the waiting area.

<Text>Awesome experience!!! I called yesterday and spoke to Pablo who was more then helpful when it came to picking the right tires for me. Pablo gave me options and explained the benefits to each one. I arrived today and Chris checked me in and got everything taken care of for me. Everyone was polite and every customer left with a smile. I don’t typically handle car stuff that’s usually my husbands area of expertise but since we had a flat tire I had no choice. It was overall a wonderful experience thank you to everyone.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Unfortunately, I got a flat Friday night. On Saturday morning, I called Evans on Magnolia, Chris ordered the tire and made sure I was set on Monday. Went in and both men at the front counter were very professional and helpful. The person closing my claim was very helpful and assured me all tires were topped off, when he asked it was already done-right one!!
Thank goodness for the lifetime tire policy!! I will continue my business there and recommend them too!</Review>

Evan’s tire has always been amazing! Excellent customer service on the 877 number (Spoke with Jason & he rocks), and their in person quality is just as amazing (Worked with Chris at this El Cajon location and he also rocks). 5 stars, will definitely tell everyone I know and be returning.  : )</Text>

My wife needed brakes and I began to do price comparisons. One company gave me an estimate of $2,500 to include rotors and everything that came with it. I later remembered about Evans treating me well when I needed a tire fixed a while back.

When I went to Evans, Chris began working and gave me a great price and my wife asked about doing the maintenance. She also asked about putting tires on my car.  In essence, we paid less than the $2,500 the other business quoted us and got the wife's car completely done and new tires for my car.

Thanks Chris for being there for us.< /text>

We have been using Evans Tire for the maintenance of outfought vehicles for many years now. We depend on them for tires and also routine oil changes and other maintenance. Their people are always courteous and knowledgeable and they will refer us to the dealer if they don’t do a particular service.</Review>

Adam was very helpful and helped me with options of tires and choose what fits my need plus stand in my offordable range. He also explained how the TPMS sensor works as it was an issue for me and had got that all sorted out. I would highly recommend Evan Tires service for you. Customer care is there.</text>

Horrible customer service.   Adam, completely ignored me when I came in and I waited about 10 mins to be acknowledged.   I was having issues with my tires constantly losing air and asked a question about if it would be possible to get new tires IF my current ones were bad.  Adam preceded to scold me by saying that's not how the warranty works and that just because I want to work that way doesn't mean it does and that just because I dont like it. I had to cut him off and asked how the warranty works.  He then refused service and told me to call Carl the manager.   Worst Evan's Tire I've ever been to.  Do not reccomend at all. Also,  I still don't know how the warranty works.  Unfortunately,  I have to get my tires looked at but this will be the last time I give them my business.< /Review>

5 stars for honesty!   We have used them for Tires, suspension and oil changes several times on several vehicles and always been satisfied.  The most recent oil change they said the valve cover gasket was leaking and need to be replaced but they would need to order the part in from Honda.  We had them do the oil change that day.  Next morning noticed oil leak on the driveway that we had never had before, we chalked it up to leak at the gasket.  Way things worked out we took it to Honda to fix the gasket.  Honda advised gasket did need to be replaced but also that the oil pan was stripped and was leaking.  They said whole pan would need to be replaced.  We took car back to Evans and at first they took a stance with my wife that it was Hondas fault.  She left vehicle with them to look at. They then called shortly there after and said they had in fact replaced the plug and that their guy installed the wrong plug, they were able to put a new plug in and correct the problem.
Mistakes happen it is how a company responds when they do.  Evans could have made this a huge fight instead they realized they made an error, admitted it and corrected it.  Couldn't ask for much more then that.    Well they could come clean the oil stain off my driveway I suppose, LOL.< /text>

Excellent work on the brake system.  Only issue I had was that the price I paid wasnt the same as the estimate because of taxes.  The difference was around $50.  That's significant to me.  In the future i believe it would be prudent to include all relevant taxes in the estimate.  That is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

Would definitely go there again, everyone was friendly and helpful. Keep up the great work guys! 😀😀<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< review>
I ordered tires for my truck , they weren't exactly what I wanted, The other tires weren't available  ,but I  bought the same brand, the price went up by $40 but still acceptable ..
Nice smooth ride..
It was pouring rain all day. I  had to go somewhere else to get a cup of coffee. But I'll  go back to Evans..thanks!</review>

Very happy with the service.. Because of a holiday we had a hard time finding the time to pick up the vehicle but they took care of it and given us time to pick it up. Big truck takes up valuable space, I have to thank them are norm is too get are stuff back fast so this was just a hardship for both us and them. Great costumer service.<//Review>

I went in for tire rotation and oil change. We normally get our oils changes at another shop, then have to go to discounts to rotate tires.We decided  try evans for new tires and oil changes they are a one drop shop and match prices! Chris very professional !!!!! Not only with me but other customers and how he answers the phone calls!!< /review>

<Text>I went to Evans tire to get my truck new tires with my stimulus payment. After pulling off tires they noticed a big problem oil all over brakes, pliers, rotor, called me which is dangerous if driven told me how much it would cost. First I was like know way I can do this after. That money just made it. I paid. Then I felt great 👍 driving now safety first.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80d9584766ca2bc9:0x232adbfcc0c8c887< /gmap_id><Date>1616310725423</Date><response>{'time': 1616605383766, 'text': 'Thank you, Kevin, for your wonderful review.

I normally go to the one by Sports Arena Blvd. They have always been awesome. Decided to go to this one cause it was closer. Evans has always had good prices in general for tires and services, but there were some things lacking at this location in particular. In the past, even if I couldn’t afford to get my tires aligned right away. They would always check (since it’s free) just so that I was aware of wether it was needed and when I had saved up some more I could come back and get that done at a later time. Here since I couldn’t pay for the alignment, they didn’t even bother to check. Also the person at sports arena was always very thorough. He would give me a copy of the work order before and of course the receipt after the service. That wasn’t the case here. The service itself didn’t take too long, but I think in the future I’ll be making the trip to the Sports Arena location.<//text>

Very poor service.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone.  Poor tire quality.  I had problems, the wheel was not properly secured after replacing it, this led to the fact that my wheel almost did not fall off when I was driving.I'm very scared.  Take care of yourself guys.  Choose a reliable service.  Not this one</Review>

<Text>I've been going to Evan's tires for a few years now for regular maintenance and tires for my 2010 Prius. I've been helped by a man named Chris there and he seems to be a very honest and helpful repairman. He gives me the information I need about my vehicle large and small and gives me recommendations about what is critical and not. I've been to other repair places that always seem to find something "wrong" with my car and are pushy about getting it replaced. I've been to Evan's many times and been told my car is in great shape with no addition work required or there are minor things wrong that don't need to be addressed unless I want it done. I will continue to go back for anything they can help me with.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>I have used Evens Tire & Service Center on N Magnolia a few times. Their salesperson gave the best customer service, very curious and friendly. It didn’t take them long and they informed me of an existing issue that I was aware of. Buy 2 and get 2 free really saved me money.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>We purchased new tires and alignments for both of our vehicles at Evan's Tire in El Cajon in 2019. Every time we bring either vehicle in for routine tire rotation they are always very pleasant and do not try to push additional services on us. They are extremely thorough with a complete car inspection and the prices are definitely lower than going to our dealer.  We recommend them to all our friends and family.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>5</Rate><review>Evans Tire & Service in El Cajon is the Bomb! They totally blew Discount Tire out of the water with their price, service and professionalism. I showed up 20 minutes before they were closing and  told them that I desperately needed it done that day and they had no problem staying late and handling that for me. The gentleman that did all four tires for me was very professional and extremely efficient. He definitely needs a raise! The very next morning I got to test the quality of the new tires. I was running a half hour late for work so I put the petal to the metal in my V8 going up Highway 67 to Poway from El Cajon. I was very impressed with the quality of the tires as they hugged the road while racing at a breakneck speed. I got to work 5 minutes earlier than what it usually takes me when I'm late. All in all I give them a 10 out of 10 or should I say 5 stars? I am very satisfied with Evans Tire in El Cajon and recommend them to everybody.</review>< Name>

Great service overall. I've been here a few times for different vehicles. My most recent visit went smooth as always. I brought in two loose wheels that I needed matched with a previous set. They pulled me up in the system and matched the set without any issues. I dropped the tires off at 5 pm and they held them until I could pick them up the following day.< /review>

Visited El Cajon Evans Tire for tire repair.  Service technician noted that tire could not be repaired and recommended replacement.  Both service and tire techs were excellent.  Able to replace 2 tires at discounted price.  Out the door within an hour.  Great team work.  Clean store and professional customer service.</Text>

< Review>
Still driving on a tire with a broken sensor , finally after waiting all day for the new one, horrible experience, bought 4 new tires and had a belt replaced,  oil change. Lied about the reason new tire was losing air. Said it was my sensor. Not losing air anymore sensor light still on and old sensor still there, their solution was to put a plastic stem ! Said the new sensor we waited all day for... wasn't programable , but my light would go off in two miles. Not. Truthfully I think they just wanted to go home since it was closing time.< /Review>

Chris was awesome. He remembered me from months ago. Helped me as much as I could afford. Schooled me on what i needed to know about my car. Then called me and told me about an offer to help me have a better running car. I plan on going back for more services and the topper is they are super close to my home.</Review>

I was in for a flat tire. They told me they didn't have it they would have to order it. Cool. It would be in the next day. I'm delivery driver driving on a spare is sketchy to me. I call two days later they told me it was on backorder. They don't know would get it in! I asked if they could get it from a different location they told me they could not.. So they called me within a couple of days. I don't know what happened I could here background noise but no voicemail. So I called back they told me they found it at an another location and I could pick it up. So I asked them to change the oil, check tire pressures and rotate tires. Per instructions when I tires from a different location. So I get my car , tire pressures were low , change oil  message is still on. So makes me wonder if they did anything I ask them to do and paid for. Hmmmmm<//Review>

<review>Went to have my brakes checked out by this shop who previously did the work. I was met with an attitude as I was describing the problem to the gentleman at the desk. I thank the mechanic who did the test drive and decided to have me come along and show him the problem. Upon leaving it seemed whatever the mechanic did worked, but as I got in my car later the squealing sound of the brakes returned. Too frustrated to go back.< /review>< pictures>

The folks at Evans Tire in El Cajon are our go-to mechanics.  They are honest, skilled, and never try to up-sell or pressure you into paying more than a fair price for exactly what your vehicle needs.  They've even done quick tire fixes for free at closing time!  How about that for dedication to their customers?  If they can't help you, they give you the name of another shop who can, and tell you to say Evans sent you to help you get the best price and service.  The guys at Evans are outstanding.  I highly recommend them.  (Only drawback is they're so busy, and the parking is limited, but hey, the service is too good to miss.)</Text>

Adam writes me up most of the time. Always courteous and wait time is very minimal. The guys working on your car go the extra mile. The older guy always finds the little things. Recently found a rat nest obscuring my cabin filter! In and out, love these guys.< /Review>

Needed an alignment on my truck unlike most places you have to set up an appointment. I was in a bind and needed an alignment right away and they were definitely right there to help out. Had to do a few more repairs on the truck afterwards and had to get another realignment took care of me right away without extra charge. Chris was extremely helpful. Thanks for taking care of me Evans tire. This is the store on Magnolia Ave in the Santee and El Cajon area.<//Text>

<Review>Made an appointment the day before for 10am. Dropped off at 9:55am. Left without tires at 12 because nobody had even touched the car. I should have know when they were running behind when I came in to make the appointment the day before.  Bad buisness practice,  I mean whats the point of an appointment? Omw to wait again because they didn't want my $650 too badly, and I am unwilling to support a buisness like this< /Review>< Pics>

In normal tire shops change tires for free if there is a guarantee.  But you have 45 & a tire for each replacement, even if there is a guarantee.  This is not a normal service.

Came here because they used to be on top of it and great. Now extended wait times and an attitude pretty much advising me they are too busy to take me. I spent 3 hours waiting on a tire rotation.  When I buy tires again I will not do it from a place that cannot follow through with a simple rotation. Used to get oil changes there too but not any further.
Not to knock Evan's in general, Poway location is great just too far from home.</review>

Took my tuck in because they had the best price for all that they were doing. 2 front tires and an alignment. 250 bucks cant beat it. Also looked at everything for free . Said they will look at tire monitor system and the weird wobble in my steering for free. Got everything done quickly with no hassle need some tire monitoring stuff but fixed the steering problem for free . Thanks Evans tire for making my vehicle safe and not blowing a huge whole in my wallet for the Holliday’s!<//text>

I was very disappointed with discount tire they ordered the wrong wheel different bolt pattern completely different wheel that we never discussed then once the correct wheel showed up the tire was too big because no one cross reference sizes so I did not go to discount tire whatsoever purchase the wheels myself and tires came to Evans tires not only did they beat the price for installation but they can also do an alignment and save me a trip I would definitely recommend anyone considering new wheels and tires< /Text>

My only go to location for maintenance of my car - be it - tire needs or oil change. It sure seems like one would think that they are only about tires, but, let me assure you, the excellent  service from Chris & his Team of very knowledgeable guys, got me as a loyal patron for many years now.  Chris is the hardworking & very honest & a great representation of the quality of product & service that I've experienced at Evans Tires at the Magnolia location in Santee, CA.<//Text>

The service was great. I called, placed on hold for a minute, and then Chris picked up to help me out. He listened, checked tire availability, and help me set up an appointment. I been going to  Evan's for about 8 years and once had an usually experience last time I went. I had to go to santee, I live in Chula Vista, to get aine rc car stuff and found them out there. The location is not hard to find. I went after work and it was busy. I got out in less than 2 hours for 4 tires, alignment, and oil change. They also did an inspection. Thanks Chris and Evan's tires.<//text>

Was disappointed with the Service manager, as I was quoted $122 for 2 tires mounted and balanced total. Ended up paying $10 for a tire pressure sensor rebuild kit that I located for $2. My final price was $138. I will never go to another Evan's Tire , nor will I ever refer anyone to. I mentioned to the manager that sometimes you need to do something in order to keep a customer,  like waive the $2 part . Not charge 500% for it. He obviously disagreed, and now Evan's tire has lost many more than 1 customer.< /Review>

<Review>BIG SHOUT OUT TO CHRIS! Great shop and team! They take wonderful care of our cars! Thank you!

Great service and communication with this shop! Took my wife's car in for an oil change, ended up doing a 90k mile tune-up (it was needed). Priced reasonably and they were even cool when we ended up picking up late from the shop after business hours. We've been looking an auto service shop since we moved to El Cajon 2 months ago and I think we may have found the right spot! Keep up the great work!<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I have bought and serviced my vehicle here many times well that stops today.  I went to go a get a patch cause my tire has a nail in it.  And these guys don’t want to patch it cause they want to sell me more tires due to going past the 2mm.  They did not give a care about my safety of my child or me and after being a good customer for so long this is the service I get.. I’ll be spending my money at Costco cause they patch my tire no questions ask..</Text><UserId.>106175303311831349083</UserId.>< gmap_id>

Also Juan was great about calling me and explaining a leak I had that needs attention. Thanks guys! I totally recommend this shop, great job<//review>

Not only are the people at this location rude & impatient they treat all customers as if they're expendable. Not only that, they damaged the tire pressure sensor on my car while installing new tires then tried to lie and say it went out on its own & tried to charge me $85 for the repair they caused. Needless to say I will never be going back to this location. Seems when a franchise has an el cajon location that location is always bottom of the barrel personnel wise. Save yourself the trouble go to any other location in San Diego.< /Text>

Fast service but damaged my TPMS sensor that I had just replaced and said they did not do it funny it was not rolling around inside the tire before I got here, took it to the manager and got resolved. best not to argue with a mechanic and his truck.<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><userid>103585325539449527742</userid><Rate>5<//Rate><text>I took my 89 300zx Turbo in for tires, and an alignment.  While we were there we added a synthetic oil change.

They got the tires and oil change done at the same time, as an efficient technician should do.  Also started with those as the old tires were in no shape for a proper alignment.

The shock came when they told me they found a problem.  We walked out to where my car was in the air with the wheels off.  They discovered that not only was the left rear control arm bent, but the frame was bent as well.

They were honest when they told me they cannot do the alignment with the control arm.  They also advised that even with a new control arm, they may not be able to align the car to specs due to the frame damage.

They took the alignment off the ticket automatically, and advised me that the car should be towed and not driven.  I was allowed to sign a waiver of liability and drive the car off.

I really appreciated their honesty and the fact there was no blame game.  They treated me the same way I tried to treat my customers as a technician before I became disabled.

I do plan on going back to them with any future needs that I can't take care of myself.  I will also refer others to them if asked where to take their car.

Thank you Parker and the team at Evans Tire.< /text><time>1546737056150< /time><username>Richard Wheeler<//username>< Pics>

I called in to get a price on their buy 2 get 2 free deal. I understand I called eight minutes before closing but I knew the tire size I just wanted a quick quote and set an appointment for tomorrow. I was transferred to the tire department after a hold the gentleman came back on the line told me they were busy. He quoted me on a set no problem but when I asked about a different brand I was told "the tire department is closed you have to call back tomorrow." It would have taken another 30 seconds to provide me the other quote. When I got off the phone I looked at the time and it was still two minutes before closing time. Needless to say I will be buying my four tires elsewhere tomorrow.</review>

Ken at the front desk is extremely professional and courteous. Evans Tire corporate prepared the deal in advance expertly, with great insight and patience. But on the actual install, the tire pressure was very different on each tire and I had to drive around the block and come back to get it evened out. Will definitely come back, but attention to detail could be improved. They were very apologetic and took care of everything extremely quickly. Not a long wait at all, within an hour of closing.<//Text>

Horrible place...first set of tires i bought here nobody said rotations are free. I paid to go elsewhere because i didn't know they do it here when you buy a set of tires. Second set of tires the new employee puts ALL my hubcaps on wrong where the valve stem didn't line up right, On top of that i didn't even know that until my hubcap comes off on the freeway causing me to inspect all my hubcaps...they tightened the caps so much they broke one. I tell the employees and nobody apologized or said a word about it. I made it a point to tell him not to put my caps back on. Then i thought, you know i don't even trust them to take them off now so i did it myself. I knew better than to ask them to buy me one because I'm sure they'd say no then I'd get irate and i didn't want that...but i would've accepted an apology today...didn't get one...not willing to accept one now...go elsewhere! I have to go back for tire rotations but i really would rather not.< /Text>

<Text>Today Evans went above and beyond for us. We see Chris there and I called super frantic after my tire pressure light came on after my four year old had dental surgery. I called and he said come on in and they would fill them for no charge. I pulled into bay 1 and didn't even have to get out of my car. The young gentleman filled them all and my light went off. Today was a rough mom day and they totally saved me with this favor of kindness. I will never forget the ease they gave this momam.

Great guy that worked the counter. They got everything done in a reasonable amount of time too. I was walk in so the wait being short was nice, they take appointments so I would say an appointment is always better.<//Text>

Good tires for a decent cost. It took longer than estimated, so they offered an additional discount to the alignment, which is cool. I would come back to this place in the future.</review>

<Review>Don’t encourage your customers to make appts online (specifically picking what time they want to come in) then tell them that appts are not available on Sunday. The employee at the front desk talked to me like I was stupid for not knowing this. Perception is reality and my perception is you should’ve honored the appointment and spoken to me with respect. Trying going on your site and scheduling an appointment for a Sunday, extremely misleading and your employee needs to speak to customers from the customers point of view. Will not be using Evan’s tires anymore.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_id>

Staff was friendly and actually showed me the cracked bushings on my front end instead of just telling me. I appreciate they did not try to sell me unnecessary items. I am a little upset (4 instead of 5 stars) because they put nitrogen in my tires vs. regular air and nobody has nitro where I live if tire goes low.</review>

Why offer a service, you seem to NEVER have time for?  You claim to offer the service, were if a tire is fixable you'll fix it for free.  I guess that service is only available, when there's no PAYING customers at the establishment?  Discount Tires it is, from here on out!<//text>

I have canceled my last review which was very negative.  I am giving Evans Tire and Service Center a 4 star rating because the manager rectified the problem that I had. I wasn't happy with the fees charged, but he called me and explained things to me and he was able to show me that customer service is his priority.  We will continue to use Evans as our tire shop and for any other service that is needed.  I would recommend Evans to my friends.< /review>

<Review>Evans is great, I've never really had a problem with waiting unless it was a Saturday or Sunday and then yes, you're bound to be waiting an hour to an hour and a half. They always honor my lifetime alignment when I go in with no hassle and gave me a quote on tires that was I was able to use two months later!</Review>< pictures>

It took 2 1/2 hours to balance my tires, change oil, and balance my tires when I had a 1:00 appointment . I got there at 12:45 and didn't leave until 2:15 ....there was only one other customer in the waiting room...I will not return to that Evans again.<//review>

Only really had a problem once about 3 years ago and they made it right. Sometimes lines can be long but that's generally when you go in late on Saturday morning or Sunday and yea sorry gonna wait that's a given. Been going here quite awhile never had an issue with them honoring their coupons or anyone else's. My suggestion speak to the manager there he's super cool and takes care of you.</Text>

If I could rate them negative I would. They tried to upcharge me $300 for a "torn break line" that I did not pay and I came to find out the hose was just lose. I will never go there again. Terrible place trying to take advantage of someone because they think I don't know cars.</review>

<Review>Don't waste your time or money here. The staff, management included, is rude and unprofessional. The boys who work here are eager to do work but are not trained or managed well. If you ask management, Alex specifically to remedy any of his staff's mis-steps he will be rude and indifferent about the situation. Not only did this store have to keep my car over night to fix a tire, they left the contents of my trunk scattered while they looked for a spare. When I called to pick up my vehicle on my lunch break, the manager assured me that it was ready. When I arrived, they hadn't even changed the busted tire I arrived with. Save your self the headache and visit a different store.< /Review>< UserId.>

<UserId.>111301728133119566113< /UserId.><text>My car overheated, Evans replaced all my radiator hoses for $700 plus dollars, overheated two more times in 24hrs, needed three tows- thank God I have AAA. Went back to Evans and they told me the temperature gauge they installed may have been faulty, they can't tall for sure. They offered me $100 discount on getting my water pump replaced for another $700 plus. No discounted labor, which I feel they should have since they didn't catch the water pump the first time, plus they tried to tell me I shouldn't have driven out to the Palm Springs after having my hoses replaced?! My daughter and I have gone to Evans in El Cajon for years. We used to see the same people all the time and felt like they did a good job and never tried to gouge us, had good customer service. I don't recognize any of the faces any more. And my daughter brought her truck in this New Year to have a basic tune up, ended up having to come back twice because the engine kept skipping and it wasn't freeway safe. I can officially say that I'm done with Evans Tire.</text>< username>

Evans Tires on Magnolia in El Cajon is horrible, starting with the manager. manager attitude is very bad. he's very tart. He's not a very nice person at all. I brought my car back for balance and rotation. he lied about why my tires were separating. I went to another tire place they explained it all to me and he was lying. he did not want to replace the two tires that were bad.Ten thousand miles. Also the buy two get two free is total bull s!#h. if you call Discount Tire and ask a price and you call Evans and ask the price they're almost exactly the same. U dont get a darn thing free. Anyway they ripped me off, they should have replaced two of my tires. Magnolia Evans Tires lied, beware don't go to Evans Tires especially the one on Magnolia

I had a 10:00 am Saturday morning appointment for new tires.  I showed up at 10:00 am and no tires, however I was told "they're on there way...".  I waited until 12:00 pm, still no tires and the manager said he couldn't contact the driver.  I got tired and left.  I went home and called the distribution center.  The distribution center told me the tires were never put on the truck but were waiting in "will call".  The second time I've experienced bad service from Evans Tire and Service Centers.  Never again.<//Text>

<Review>Made an appointment for 730 in morning for Saturday. They opened at 730 so it was the first appointment. I sat here for an hour watching peoples cars come and go for same thing I brought my car in for. I asked what the deal was with my car and asked why it hasnt been in Garage yet. They sat there and argued with each other of why my car hasnt been looked at yet. By far the worst Evans Tire I have been to. I will never come back to this one.

Guy on the phone Epi said $265 out the door for 4 new tires with a warrantee, then when I get in another guy Chris says no, you need to get an alignment done unless the warrantee will be void. They said alignment is 60 or 70, yet somehow the total came to $355? In addition I believe the guy I was dealing with in person was QUITE rude seemed like he hated being there or something. This place seemed fantastic over the phone but a tragedy once I showed up.  I'll definitely be going back to Discount Tire. Yikes.</review>

Evans tires is no longer what it used to be. I will no longer be a customer for many reasons, the most recent one was when they REPEATEDLY TOLD ME I NEEDED A TRANNY FLUSH. The computer guy at the front desk and his mechanic in the back swore i needed it, they showed me the color, the texture, everything...but what they didnt know is that I had just recently had one done somewhere else 1 month or so ago, I had my receipt in my car I brought it and asked them, why would i need that service done when i just had it done. They apologized and said they have no clue why the color looked like it was vital for them to change out fluids...they wanted $280 from me thats why</text>

Carl is very unprofessional, especially for being a manager. Long story short. I bought brand new tires here and was told by my mechanic that something in my tire was making a clicking noise(it sounded like a bearing was loose in my axle I had no clue the noise was coming from the tire this whole time) carl refused to fix my band sensor that they broke when they put my tires on and claimed I broke it by hitting something with my tire. (I never have before).  On my paper when I got my invoice back it says and I was told I needed a new sensor because my other one was bad and my light came on now. Before I got new tires that light was NEVER on. Therefore they broke it when I got my new tires from them and that's what caused this noise for months. Carl called me a liar and said I was fishy in front of customers and was EXTREMELY rude. Before he left he said "if you're husband wants to talk to me tell him to call me" you guys suck never having you guys touch my car again</review>

< Review>
They post ads and send you flyers but they always find a way to avoid their own posted  discounts.......two years ago I purchased four pirelli tires from Magnolia shop in El Cajon....I asked for my free alignment but they said it doesnt apply to my purchase....a week later I received a flyer of free alignment on purchase of 4 tires.......I called them they appologize and said come back to do the alignment but with another car NOT the same car the tires were installed ......!!! what a stupid idea
Lately, my daughter went to them again because they have buy 2 get 2 free for the Pirelli for $250 again they denied saying it does not apply on the size purchsed ....so they charged $328 which is the market price ........and again they said the alignment is not free but you get 30%, however, their invoice showed full charge with no damn 30% off ............same old story.......they always have excuse< /Review>

This place has to be the worst of all. I went in to buy 4 new Pirelli tires and they said I needed an alignment. When I left I tested out the alignment and the car would not drive straight. So I took it back the tech took it for a drive and then put it back on the jack to rotate the wheels. As the tech that put the tires on started laughing at the alignment guy even know they were rotating the tires. Then he test drove it and said it was driving straight now. I took it for another test drive after and it still would not drive straight so I went back and picked up the tech to show him. After that he did his second alignment even though the store assistant manager said it was the tires. We took it out again and I still would not drive straight. They ended up switching the tires with and new set and it still did not drive straight. They took my tires off my car a total of four times and did two alignments. Also now my air bag light is on. The assistant manager ended up cussing me out, the tech test drove my car without wearing a seatbelt, and the assistant manager was smoking in the warehouse and when he came in to check me out he smelt in smoke. This is the worst customer service I have ever been to.< /text>
