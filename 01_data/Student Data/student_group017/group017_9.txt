<Review>These guys were fabulously awesome. I went at 8am on a Saturday. Craig (boss man I think). He explained it was half day for them so most likely would not be able to look at my car till Monday..The Stability Control light was on. He Explained it was safe to drive around town till Monday. I came back Monday. First of all the diagnostic test was only $75. I  recently had tires rotated and wheels aligned. Well nothing showed on the exam and they couldn't reset the dash light and only charged $50. So many others would not have been morally considerate..I'm new to Alameda.they will surely be my go to auto servicer's for more serious conditions. They had plenty business and treated everyone as they mattered. Great guys👌</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>Engine warning light came on. They accepted me to go round within 10 muns. They checked the computer. Even checked what the code was telling them on the car. Couldn't find a problem reset the engine warning light. Explained what to look out for. Excellent service. I would recommend these guys to anyone on Alameda.<//Text>< pics>

<Time>1613184361460<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><text>Incredible service beyond expectation. When my emergency roadside assistant told me my car wasn’t drivable, I found this place nearby where I live. All it took was phone call — they accepted my request for my car to be towed there. In less than 24 hours, they fixed the main thing and found additional issues. They called me for permission to fix more things, which they finished in just a few hours. Royal Auto Repair truly gave me the “wow, that’s incredible” moment. The price was reasonable as well. Servicemen were very professional and friendly. Definitely will revisit if I need car related help! 5 stars without question.< /text>< Pics>

Craig and his mechanics are hard-working and extremely honest people.  The business is fixing cars and no hype.  These guys are very trustworthy.  I took my family car (Mazda5 Minivan) to them for strut replacement and a noise coming from the front end.  Craig and his mechanic Kevin troubleshot the problem with the noise and finally after 2 previous trips to the dealer, found the problem and replaced worn control arm bushings.  The car now drives and sounds great.  I recommend this shop.< /Review>

<text>Top 3 reasons why I'm happy with my visit:

1. They fit me in on a Saturday to recharge the freon before a heatwave.
2. After a continued lack of cold air they quickly and easily diagnosed the problem.
3. When all was said and done the price was more than fair.

Will definitely be coming back!</text>< gmap_id>

My husband and I have both had our cars worked on here. This week, we took them in to be serviced as we’ll be driving 2000 miles away to move to the Midwest next week. I had to post a review because this team of mechanics is hands down the best. They ask you how you are, they have a sense of humor, they’re incredibly personable and kind, and best of all, they seem to have such empathy and understanding when it comes to breaking the news that your car needs some expensive work done, and they make it obvious that they want to help you out by giving you options and explaining everything in detail so you can choose the path that works for you financially. They don’t just skip over the fact that there might be a cheaper part that will save you money, just so they can make more. They try to get your car done as fast as possible to ensure you don’t overpay for hours and hours spent with them doing god knows what. They break down everything they did for you. Both my husband and I were disappointed to learn that we’d each be needing $400-$600 in repairs for our cars to make them safe to drive cross-country but the guys here obviously knew that was rough, and were kind and empathetic the whole time without pushing us to do anything. We trust them, they work WAY faster than you’d expect given how busy literally every place in the Bay Area can be, and we just both really appreciate them! PS: Craig is the one we’ve worked with the most. Super super good dude. Thanks Craig!</Text>

<Review>Mechanics are very friendly and personable. Usually give you great advice and service. Only discrepancy to that is our last visit they charged us $6 to fill the washer fluid and charged an hour for labor to replace the cabin air filter which takes 5 min max to do it yourself.</Review>< UserId.>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I brought my car in for an oil change. They said I needed my rotors replaced. I pushed back saying that my dealership looked at it a month ago and said it was fine... they insisted so I decide "well they have great reviews, everyone else says they're trustworthy so I'll listen to them." I kept the rotors. Now that I'm back in my home town I got the rotors inspected by multiple people, they are within factory spec and could've been resurfaced. The folks here saw my out of state license and figured they could cheat me out of hundreds of dollars. Very disappointed, I trusted them and they treated me like an ATM.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
My husband took our car in Thursday morning because it was making funky squeaky sounds. They quoted us a very reasonable price to change the brakes, adjust the belt and do a tire rotation. They exceeded my expectations, I'm very happy with everything. When I came to pick up the car Thursday evening, I realized they went above and beyond by fixing our bumper which was a little loose. I would recommend them to friends and family for sure! Thank you CJ! I never met CJ but that's what the receipt says! 👌< /Review>

Truly the best experience I have had with mechanics!

My tire got hit pretty bad by an object that also caused for the sensory wires to get cut. I took the car in immediatley and 2 hours later they called me to tell me they were able to fix it AND had already ordered my new tire, and the price was much cheaper than I would of thought.

Everything was such a breeze, Craig and Kevin were so awesome, helpful and sweet. Definatley will come back if I ever have a car emergency and would suggest it to anyone!< /Text>

My elderly mother, who does not have internet access, brought her car in there regularly. After a small repair, her car developed a small oil leak that the shop said that they would fix, since they caused it. She dropped her car off on a Thursday and was told she could pick it up Monday. She was there Monday and they hadn't even touched her car and they didn't seem to care that they inconvenienced her for four days. I can't say that I've been to the shop, but I doubt I ever will, nor would I recommend that anyone else should either.</text>

<Review>This place is a real shop. Great variety of merchandise. Got go wrong here. There is no better feeling than walking thru a door to be greeted by family u know the place were you no matter what circumstances and the Owner here is o e of those people he's as real as it gets if you been as  fortunate as I to introduce yourself and got to know one another you know what's up.. Go out of my way to go here first as u should.</Review>< pictures>

AVOID! Worst smoke shop anywhere (on either side of the country). The slow-witted mongrel stoners that that giggle in the backroom are useless, lazy, and lack basic communication skills. This shop has higher prices than any other store I've been to in the Bay Area. They won't allow you to return*defective* equipment that they sell and are happy to rip off their customers. Take your business literally ANYWHERE else.</review>

<text>A hidden Culver City spot with a lively vibe to share plates (and pitchers) with a group! Creative twist on Mexican cuisine - Queso and guac to start,  squash and okra for some sides and pork, chicken and shrimp for your mains! Flour and corn tortillas are available.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Hope this place does well. Basically a newer, smaller, even more casual version of Bar Ama in downtown. Wouldn’t say the queso was as good as the one I had at Bar Ama, but it’s been a while and I still recommend getting it and adding more chips to eat it with. Really like the idea of the bigger format meat dishes to eat with handmade flour tortillas. Got the Denver steak and one of the roast chickens (Mexican marinated one) and while they were cooked well, it came out just a little cold. They could maybe be sliced better so you can fill up the tacos more easily. Service was just a little slow but overall I really like the concept. Also recommend the homemade craft sodas, those were cool. Pricing is really solid.<//Review>

One of my favorite spots for tasty texmex. Fell in love with this place from the 1st taste. I had a brother come into town and he asked me to go back here. It has a great atmosphere. If it wasn't far from my work I would come by more.</Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Time>1574891412768< /Time><Text>Service was fast for all portions of our meal - quite impressed at how efficient their kitchen is. The food was beautiful and the queso fundido was very Tex mex flavored. However there were a couple of dishes which were too salty. The pork dish and the dessert of hoja Santa pana cotta had too much salt for my liking. The salt chunks were too big for the dessert and overwhelmed an otherwise good and beautifully textured pans cotta.
Also for a $13 adult beverage I would have hoped that the drinks were not watered down or as small as they were. My sangria glass was smaller than the candles on the table! All that being said I think if they can monitor the salt a bit better this place could be great since their charred snap peas was great and since they have so many ve he table options would be a great spot for mixed vegetarian / non vegetarian folks.</Text>< Name>

Delicious food and aggressive staff. Worst service we’ve had in a bit in Culver. This place missed the mark greatly on a good first impression. Our party was told 45 minutes, ended up at an hour and a half with no text confirmation when ready, and they lost our waitlist entry - host had an attitude about it that bothered our group after such a long wait. Long wait to take our orders as well. It’s very easy to be nice to diners, from our restaurant work experience. Kindness and competence are simple.</text>

Nice atmosphere and delicious food. From my experience there was some serious wait(Way more than expected)  to compensate we got guac and ciders on the house though. I would go again but maybe try not dinner hour or reservations is possible.</Review>

<review>We had seen the place had changed it's concept and were excited to try after seeing the menu and photos of the food. It did not disappoint. We ordered the grilled shrimp, grilled mini corn, and the pork dish, with rice and beans. It was all delicious and beautifully presented. Fresh, flavorful and great service too. Look forward to trying everything eventually. It was fairly quick too, so great before catching a movie. I wish success for this new awesome restaurant!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>The food and drink are consistently delicious with the Queso being an absolute must. That being said, service is rather lacklustre and timing needs serious improvement. This would be a great place to go before a film at the Arclight, but the food comes out far too slowly for comfort. Perhaps it’s time to look into hiring a (new) expediter... I really love the food, so am hopeful they get there act together when it comes to service and timing ASAP.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Almost don't want to say how good the food and vibe is here, 'cuz the place is small, and there probably will be lines to get in. That said, I gotta say that Amacita is a revelation. Go. Thank me later.</Review>

For a couple of years, this was the Baco Shop, a fast casual place with good food. Now, the owners have reconfigured it as a sit-down Tex-Mex restaurant and bar. There is a similar place downtown, Bar Ama. The food is good. Delicious flour tortillas are featured in many dishes. Queso was well garnished, and a summer salad with peach and tomato was delicious. Pork shoulder pibil was very good, served with three puffy & yummy flour tortillas.<//text>

<Review>We know Josef Centeno from Orsa & Winston in downtown and the earlier Baco Shop which was in this location. While we were saddened that Baco Shop closed, we're more than happy with the change to Ama-cita (Tex-Mex). This was a wonderful find and much closer to our home. We've eaten there multiple times since their opening a few weeks ago.

The menu is tapas style and intended to be shared. There are a number of vegetarian and vegan choices so my wife doesn't go away hungry. But there are meat dishes, like carne guisado (braised marinated beef), to satisfy the carnivores. There is a nice balance between innovation and tradition. Food is delicious. Don't look for tacos or enchiladas. It's Tex-Mex, not Mexican.

Rather modest wine and beer list until they get their liquor license. Staff is friendly, cheerful and helpful. They may still be working out some of the opening day kinks but if Josef's other restaurants are a guide, Ama-cita will operate in tip top shape shortly.

There is a limited amount of patio (street side) dining. I don't know if they take reservations. We've come on the spur of the moment but the restaurant is already popular and can be crowded.

Parking is a problem, particularly for handicapped people. There are city parking structures a few blocks away for those who are mobile. We use Lyft.< /Review>< pictures>

My second stop of the morning.  A short walk to Paloma/Ocean from where I parked.

Once you check out the soldier, soak in the view or take a nice walk along the shore.<//Review><date>1613252934186</date><gmapID>0x80dd31ab2a01e173:0xd5b8d6a28febb87f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice Green Space Park; long & narrow. Came out to fly RC Gliders, just off Coronado & Ocean. There is also a nice paved bike/pedestrian walk below the bluff.<//text>

Nice place to take photos and take the family to the beach. It's now a very clean and relatively safe area. The statue is a replica, and I heard there are many of these all over the world. Just Google it to see.</Review>

<Text>The lone sailor statue is something you must see if you are down by the shore. The lone sailor faces the shore and the view is beautiful especially when you can catch a glimpse of Catalina Island or a perfect sunset.< /Text>< Pics>

There is something very moving about this statue that stares into the sea with his duffel bag at his side.  There are also identical memorials near Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco  and about 14 other locations all over the USA, including the original in Washington, DC..<//text>

Went to Stater Bros. only.👍 Excellent staff. They helped me find several things I was shopping for. This was just my second time there. Manager
Rich Martinez, Parsons - great PR worker, Isaac in the meat dept, Ryan the checker, Ashley the courtesy bagger, Lexi the parking lot cart retriever all get an "A" for their great service!🌝😄👍🙋‍♀️🇺🇸<//review>

(Translated by Google) The newly built shopping plaza is convenient for the people. There is a foreigner’s supermarket in the plaza. The price is the regular price of the old American supermarket. It is more expensive than the Chinese supermarket, but the things are absolutely fresh.

The process was very quick.  We discussed everything via phone, text or email.  When we had agreed on everything, we went in to sign papers.  We were in and out in two hours.  Super happy with our Tahoe!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Had a 10:30 appointment.  Got there at 10:30.  Was told to wait out side door for next available person to help me.  Stood there for 10 minutes, was only person in line and no one ever was available.  Finally just walked in a asked is any service person working as still hadn't seen one free, remember I was only person there.  They told me to go wait by one guy and he would help me next.  Stood at his counter for another 10 minutes before he could help me.  Finally gave him my name said I had appointment at 10:30, 20 minutes ago.  He looked me up and saw that I was there for a software update on my Volt.  Took my keys and said he would process my service in a bit.  Would take 2 hours.  Said I didn't need tp wait for paperwork as there was no charge.  So I left.  Now 11.  Started calling at 1:30, never got anyone to help me.  Called multiple times.  Finally just went to dealer at 3:30.  Went to the same person.  He couldn't find my info in the computer by my name.  Looked for about 15 minutes.  When he found it mutter something like it was in his name, what????  Said car was ready and go wait outside as he would call someone to get it.  Waited outside for about 15 minutes, finally went back in and asked him if car was ready.  Said let me go check.  Walked away for about 20 minutes.  Came back and said they were bring it up now.  About 20 minutes later someone brought it up.  I had to wait at dealer way too long to drop it off and to pick it up.  This was not a good experience for me at this dealership.</Text>

<text>I was having problems with the fobs and as a result, could not gain entry into my car.  With the help of a locksmith I was able to enter, but the dash read that it could not detect the fob.  The locksmith changed the batteries which helped.  I was able to get the car to your dealership and found the service writer, Carlos, most helpful.  He fixed the problem and I was on my way in no time.<//text><UserId.>106196640297237633720< /UserId.>< name>

Although the service tech was good, the service team was definitely short handed and running about.  The service area is crowed, having to be within 2 feet of people moving about in the small room. Should be re-configured for better Covid distancing.< /review>

I’ve had to stand around to be helped! No one apologizes for the wait, nor have you been helped yet! I think it’s rude that no one even says hello as they walk right past you. As a customer whom is also in the customer service business, I feel that anyone you come in contact with or walk by someone, that you should acknowledge them and not act as if you didn’t see them.</Review></record>

< review>
I had a fantastic experience at Silver Star. Ruben greeted us when we entered the dealership to look at a vehicle for my daughter. He asked what kind of car we were looking at for her and then introduced us to Freddy to help us find a car. Freddy was extremely friendly, polite and very knowledgeable about the vehicles we wanted to look at. He showed us some options and we decided on a new 2020 Trax. Ruben worked with Freddy to get us the best price and financing for the car. I would definitely recommend all my friends and family to go and see Ruben and Freddy if they are looking for a new vehicle. The process was very easy and we were out of finance very quick. Thank you to the Silver Star staff for letting us borrow the big green bow & helping us surprise our daughter with a beautiful new Trax with awesome Redline package!! She was very surprised and loves her cute new Trax!!< /review>

Made an appointment online to get my car serviced (Chevy).  When I got to the dealer (Cadillac because Chevy service is closed),  I found out they no longer offer shuttle service.  This was not mentioned on their website-the website allows you to set up a time for shuttle service. Please update the website if the shuttle service is no longer available.  I wasted my time driving there.  With the prices they charge for servicing at the Cadillac dealer, I'm surprised this service is no longer available. May be time to find another dealer.< /Text>

One headlight wouldn’t work, and it turned out to just be a burnt out connection the size of my thumb.  Cost me $208 and the light didn’t need to be changed.  I could have gotten the same service result for less than a third the cost with 15 minutes of effort and a trip to the local auto parts store. I was charged $140 for labor despite the fact the job would only take 10 minutes at the most.  I also was told they would charge me an extra $180 to even try to diagnose an issue with my USB port. They take advantage of everyday people because enough wealthy people don’t care to be overcharged.  It’s not the way to help customers.  It’s just a way to help their bottom line.< /text>

You relocated your service and it took me 20 min. To find the new one. Once I got there I waited in the lobby for 10 min before anyone even acknowledged me. My car was finished and nobody noticed me that it was done. There was no record of me even being there when I arrived even though I have had my car serviced there before.<//Review>

Augustine and your finance manager were a pleasure to deal with. They exemplified patience and professionalism in putting together the lease for my car. The whole process was seamlessly done over the internet through emails and texts. Augustine even delivered my new car and picked up my old one, making this car buying experience completely painless and safe.<//Review>

<review>Was told at check in it would be 2 hours, they had the vehicle for over 6 hours. Vehicle was not cleaned. Paper mats and plastic covers left in the vehicle when picked up. Was told the $20 for tire rotation would be removed from the bill, it wasn't. The estimate neglected to include the cost of parts/fluids so after receiving a $50 coupon discount I still paid more than the estimate. All in all, a poor experience. Unfortunately, it is the closest dealer to me.< /review><date>1609268020294<//date>< user_id>

<text>I would definitely not recommend this dealership. everything from the sales to financing down to the customer service in the service department. When I purchased my truck I was offered GM financing, but the financing department messed and submit my credit application multiple times, even though i was approved by GM already, after fighting with the Financing supervisor to have them fix the problem, they then offered me a service contract which I purchased and they didn’t apply to my account, and haven’t been reimbursed the 1600 dollars it costed me nor has anyone returned my calls. brought the truck in for the first service took 1 and 1/2 hours to drop off because they couldn’t find me in the system, I had a 7:30 appt the next day. when i arrived at 5pm that night my truck hadn’t even been looked at, then they tired to give me someone else’s truck thinking it was mine. after repeatedly asking to speak to manager none were available. This is hand down the worst experience i’ve ever had buying a vehicle. and there have been no attempts to reach out and fix the problem. and my truck still hasn’t received the service i dropped it off for.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1613577734255, 'text': 'Hi, thank you for your feedback.

<text>Only called the service department to get basic information on hours and if i need to make and appointment but before I got to ask,  I was asked whats wrong with the car as if they're picking and choosing what to work on. I had to stop that women from talking and asked if I need to make an appointment, she responded with "oh thats all you wanna know?"

I hung up. What a shame and nope I will not nor ever do business with that store just for that reason. Who knows how long that been going on.

Too late to apologize, perhaps your chevy store needs to talk about that.  I only give 1 chance and thats already gone.</text>< Pics>

<text>Hi. I never write comments like this. I usually just move on from a bad experience, but in this case I thought it may help to warn anyone buying a used car from Silver Star Chevrolet.

So take these comments for what they are worth to you.

A couple of weeks ago I saw a Honda Element listed on Carfax. It was for a good price and it had everything you would normally see on a carfax ad of a car for sale. It did only have one picture.

I left from San Diego early monday morning to see it in person, test drive it and buy it. I did not need financing, I was ready to buy.

The drive was long and hot. 3.5 Hours it took me to drive from San Diego.
When I arrived, they a nice sales person told me it was not for sale. I said, it is for sale and if its not why is it online. He said, I tell them not to list cars when they are not for sale. I asked to at least see it. He said it was in their shop and I cant go back there.

After a few minutes of feeling like i was in the twilight zone, I said I wanted to talk to the manager to at least see the vehicle. The finally relented and brought me to the Honda Element, which was NOT silver at all. It was a completely other color. It was dirty and not prepped at all. They said they were waiting on parts for the air box to be put on.

All said, I started it up and decided I wanted to buy it none the less.

OK, so up till this point, they have a car listed on carfax for sale that is not for sale. Its not even legal to sell (airbox) and its dirty and has food all over it like a family just dropped it off.

Now he walks me to another sales person who he wants to handle the sale.  Both of them give me their word that when it gets the airbox on it, they will call me and I can come pick it up.

I Drive back to San Diego. A reach out by text to the sales agent every couple of days. Can he give me an update. Can he send me pictures.
He says its still waiting to be fixed and he will try to send me some pictures.

Friday comes (5 days), I text him and ask him if its ready. He sends back a text that ITS SOLD!  And how sorry he is that someone there sold it with out him and the first sales person knowing.

In the 5 days I waited for this Honda Element, I lost out on two others.

Thanks Bob and Johnathan for your word.

Lastly, I get an email from the Manager Ruben, entitled "we value your business"
"We want to make sure that all of our clients are treated with courtesy and respect, as well as provided the information and opportunity for you to have a hassle-free purchasing experience."

<Text>I will not be coming back to Silver Star Chevy. From the time of purchase of my 2019 Chevy Bolt EV Premier (12/01/2019) and over 1 year later, this has been the worse purchase of a vehicle in the last 32 years of buying cars. The car was sold to me under the wrong VIN, I drove off the dealership missing the car charger. The car sale paperwork had to be redone. A used car charger was delivered to me the following day, which I had to return to the dealership after receiving a new one. The alarm system that came with the vehicle was not activated, and had I not followed up with that, it never would have. Then I received my financing statement, and after inquiring about the VIN number, I found out that I would be paying off the wrong vehicle. That had to be corrected. Then my registration and plates came for the wrong VIN number. Then the correct plates came with the correct VIN number. I had to take the wrong plates back to the dealership.

Then my DMV renewal arrived. I received renewals for 2 vehicles. I called Silver Star and was directed to the appropriate department. They prepared and emailed me two DMV forms, and instructed me to mail in my payment with those forms (not to renew online). I did that. I was able to secure a better interest rate through refinancing the auto loan, but the DMV was nearly 3 months behind processing their DMV registration renewals. In order to refinance my vehicle I had to go to a local DMV and pay the fees again. Now I've paid for my registration twice ($506 x 2), hoping that I will receive a refund at some point in time.

Since the first few days, the car dash had a service warning for "pedestrian friendly alert." I called 3 different local dealerships Sliver Star, Keys Chevy Van Nuys, and Paradise Chevy in Oxnard) for more info, but was not provided any information. I was recommended to bring the vehicle in, but would not be provided a loaner until the dealership ran diagnostics to see if it was a warranty issue. I am a healthcare provider. I commute 45 miles each way several days per week to my office. I could not be without a car. Then there was a recall for the vehicle, and I was able to secure a loaner due to some other warranty-related issues. Upon inspection of the vehicle I was informed that the "pedestrian friendly alert" was malfunctioning due to rodent damage of a wire harness. I explained that I have called about this issue since the first few days I had the car, but to no avail. Preliminary estimate was $370. The service manager took $50 off, so it ended up costing me $320. When the service adviser informed me the car was ready, I asked them to charge the battery prior to my pick up. That was not done. I have never had such a bad experience with a vehicle purchase or service. I like my car, but not enough to deal with this type of service from Chevy. This will likely be my last Chevy. Very frustrating experiences.</Text>< Pictures>

Jorge went over and beyond to recognize that I was 80 miles from hitting the 60K warrantee milestone and, therefore, did a much more thorough inspection only to discover that I had an oil pan situation that was still under the 60K warrantee. This saved me $800. Also, the actual cost was $100 less than quoted. H was also able to expedite the wait time as I had come in from Calabasas and had an important meeting I needed to attend. Exceptional service and kudos to him and the service team that were 3 people short and had to deal with an irate customer who was rude and disrespectful, to say the least. Mel.</Review>

Bought a vehicle from this dealership and a second key for the vehicle was promised as part of the deal to purchase. After months of calling with an update on getting the key, they kept saying it was on back order. Now (to no fault of the dealership) I have lost my key and have to get the vehicle towed to a dealership in order for them to make another key for car.</text>

I’m kind of disappointed of your service!
I called your service and explained the problem and I’ve been transferred to OnStar service to tow my car to your service department. I waited for 6!!!! Hours for tow truck arrived! A several tow companies affiliated with OnStar called me and told me a stories about their technical problems.
After my car was fixed ( takes 2 days to change 12V battery)! I got my car not washed as all dealers do.< /text>

<text>We bought a ZR2 here and the buying experience was zero pressure (a relief considering the "usual" dealer methods). They worked with us and gave us all the time and space needed to make the best decision possible. Also, great to note the team environment here vs "one person is on commission so every man for himself" attitude.
Special shout out to Ruben for working with us! 😊< /text>< pics>

I had a bad experience with the sales team at Silver Star earlier this year so I purchased my Colorado elsewhere. However, I recently took my new truck to SS for service and could not have had a better experience. Had it there by 8 AM and I was on my way home by 9:00 AM. Fast, friendly (thanks Becky), competitive pricing and communication via text when my truck was ready to be picked up was awesome. I'm happy I gave them a second chance.< /Text>

1. Phone calls answered promptly and politely (Megan). Able to get service appt. sooner than with Rydell, Simi Valley, or Keyes.
2. Accurate assessment of engine oil life reported - I chose to defer service.
3. High voltage system trouble codes cleared, battery coolant checked, software updates, and tire checks done no charge.
4. Engine and trans coolant, brake fluid exchanges completed - all service done same-day!
4. Had $75 off coupon applied.
5. Service rep. Carmen Perdomo stayed after 6 pm to wait for my arrival to pick up car. Courteous and pleasant, she made the experience a joy.

Excellent service - thank you Silver Star!!< /text>

while your phone receptionist is almost useless, and your signage needs work, and no one knows where your Chevy service is located, your service reps were excellent, and very helpful once I found them after having been directed to three different locations to find the service entrance.< /Review>

<Text>this dealership keeps disappointing time after time.
service department is lacking of communication, they are happy to transfer you to another extension just to get rid of you even though no one picks up on the other extension, just a voice mail... they are very efficient at sending you surveys after every trip there, there are number one at doing that, well guess what, your service suck! be less worry about the feedback people leave on you and actually give them GOOD costumer service and fix the damm issue with the car!  then you won't be worried so much about the surveys.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Looked at the vehicle one day ran through finance and all. Could not decide but that evening I told the rep I would be there the next day to close the deal. Made an appointment and drove the 100 miles (one way) to seal the deal and they told me they sold the vehicle before I got there. No call or anything, just a wasted day and wasted gas. Beyond unprofessional<//Review>< Pics>

No integrity at all!!!! My story is too long but had a buyback on a Chevy Blazer. Ruben (sales Manager) sold the car he had put away for me while my buyback was pending. They lied to me about covering my rental car expenses..... ended up with a $1000 bill. Found out through their employee, Megan, that Silver Star should have covered the expense. Now fighting for reimbursement. Beenwithout a car for 3 months. Never going back!< /text>

<Review>Stay away from this sketchy dealership! They tried to get me to sign a lease agreement with a higher price than what we negotiated and tried to justify it saying that it didn't matter what's on the agreement because my payment would remain the same! Make sure you understand your contract glad I made sure it didn't add up and walked away! Beware of the deception occurring here!</Review><userid>109118810592374705441</userid><Name>Marisa Portillo</Name><Rate>1</Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

The service I received at Silver Star Chevrolet was excellent. Carmen Pedomo did an great job addressing all of the work that needed to be done to my car and making sure the work was promptly completed so that the time I was without my car was minimized. I highly recommend Silver Star Chevrolet Service Center for any future work you may need to have done to your automobile.< /Review>

<user_name>Phoebe pha< /user_name><Time>1589162218238</Time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>The police was called in to help me- the Sales Manager had my car without giving me any paperwork for my lease return. On Sunday, May 10, I came in to return my car lease that I purchased from them. They told me I had to come back Monday. This isn't right bc I had already called a few days before and they said I can return this weekend! They took my keys, car, registration card without providing me the paperwork. Fishy! I asked them to at least handwrite a note and Ruben had an attitude, " I can but that won't do anything for you." Then they tell me that they can't provide the paperwork bc their system is down.  My friend, who knew more about lease returns, told me they are required to give me proper lease return documents. He questioned how the finance system is "down" yet they are still able to finance cars sold that day.  I phoned GM financials right at that moment and the GM case manager said the dealership should be able give me the paperwork. Bottomline, I did not get the protocol service, they almost fooled me in letting me walk off their lot without any evidence that I dropped my car off.   My friend was mad that they took the car without giving me the paperwork and he called the police. My friend was mad how they took advantage of me. On top of that, Reuben told the police that we are not allowed back to their dealership and he wanted me off their lot. I was waiting there while the police talked to him. Don't worry, we'll take out business elsewhere! Why can't we return the car on Sunday?! Why am I asked to come back the next day? Why didn't I get the proper paperwork? Is it because it goes against their sales goal for the day- corruption! or was that he was lazy? It wasn't professional nor  ethical to let me drop off my car without giving me any paperwork. They led me to believe this is how it is done until my friend advised me otherwise. Now I am stuck another day of owning this car and this dealer (Reuben) has "banned" us on their private property. Let me tell you, this dealer doesn't want to take back their own leased vehicle, disrespected us and shamed us.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Terrible experience, I am in the beginning stages of purchasing a new work vehicle. I went into this dealer and asked for pricing on the their most basic 1500 Silverado. The sales person tried his best pitch but I’m not ready to buy.
The manager would not give me MSRP pricing until I gave them my personal info.
I was told if I didn’t let them put me in their system they would not give me the basic pricing.
Obviously I left. On my way out the manager shouted “good bye”.
I will be purchasing a new work truck but definitely not from this place.< /Text>

Well, the car i was leasing is ok , i was pretty shocked to find out the sales person who is the manager of the store sold me a car with defective part. I had huge headache for the past few month to go and fix everything every second
They refused to take the car back and give me something new that actually don’t need fixing< /Text>

<Text>Silver Star continues to raise the bar when it comes to customer service and repairs. My service performed was for a Chevy recall, as I walked into the service bay to check in I was greeted by staff and immediately was attended to. Within 5 minutes I was checked in and asked if I required a shuttle(which I didn’t not need). I was promised a 1pm pick up time, I received a text at 11am that my truck was ready. I highly recommend Silver Star!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Had my 2014 Express Van 4500 chassis motor home serviced at Silver Star for a recall on a window switch.  The service writer, Lamar Franklin, did an excellent job of logistically arranging the repair at their service center across the street which handles larger vehicles.  Once at the service center the Lead Tech, Jose, immediately started in on the repair and had me out of there in minimal time.  Jose really knows his stuff!  Overall, an outstanding experience!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Bad customer service. I have been leasing cars for more than 10 years and because of their mistakes gmfinancial is charging me extra money. Now is on me to fix their mistake. Thanks . Last time leasing with you .

And they respond saying to contact them and I have 3 times and you say there is nothing you can do. This has been going on since August and it’s now mid November. I’ve even talked to the manager frank. But when I call Gm financial they always ask they ask if I’m the dealer or a customer so the dealer could easily try to clean up there mistake<//review>

<review>Overall, it was excellent!! Sales team I worked with, Konstantin and Theo, was great.  The only thing I didn't like was that accessory charge (+$1000.00 for alarm,..etc) was added to MSRP.   Also I didn't like that we added extended service contract cost to financing.  I am still pondering if it is really needed.  It would be more desirable to offer the extended service contract separate from car purchase contract/financing. If I am to score with numbers I will give 4.5.<//review>< Response>

My check engine light came on and I checked the code, and learned that there might be an issue with my catalytic converter. So when I took my car in for an oil change, I asked about checking the catalytic converter and discussed issues that could be happening with the catalytic converter with a service rep. The service rep told me i would have to pay $160 for them to check it out. I declined. My issue is that the rep failed to advise me that California law requires car dealers to replace catalytic converters within 5 years or 100,000 miles (whichever is first) FOR FREE. Two months later, I found that I do need a replacement and my 5-year warranty ended 4 weeks ago. It will be $2k to replace. This place has lost my business forever.<//text>< pictures>

The diagnosis of my car came out all normal. That shows Chevy needs to come up with better diagnosis methods to identify the possible reasons for mileage drop. For 4 years I did not have any issue with electric mileage. One fine morning the mileage dropped by 7 miles. I observed the car for one month making note of my driving, climate control etc. After one month of observation only I took the car to Chevy. But that fact aside the front desk service from Carmen and pick and drop service was outstanding. These employees deserve raise or promotion. Very refreshing to meet with these hardworking folks.

<UserId.>111760144552466433706<//UserId.><text>I was surprised that we were allowed to do test drive alone without sales person in the car. The negotiation was short and effective and everything else is standard. One thing that I'm not happy with is that we were told the car's odometer reading was 19 miles, and that's on the paperwork as well. However, when I got the car, I found it had 152 miles on it already. If I were told ahead of time, I wouldn't be bothered at all. I wouldn't even ask for any discount on that mileage. That fact that I found out about that after everything was singed just make me feel uncomfortable.
One week later, I just found out something that made me very unhappy. I was checking the purchase agreement and found out that they put in a KARR security system for $795.  I remembered I was asked to sign some paperwork mentioning KARR, but was told the dealer took care of it. I thought the finance manager meant it was free or was included in the negotiated price. He never told me it would cost me $795 extra and there was no price on the paperwork I signed. This is cheating!!!<//text>< gmapID>

Brought my 2018 Equinox in for the 15,000 mile service and oil change and as always, Becky in the service department was on it. Extremely friendly service and was in and out in 30 mins! Very happy with Silver Star Chevrolet.<//Review>

<Time>1560622008096</Time><UserId.>107142563409653677371<//UserId.><text>I have been Silver Star Chevy for a couple of services since moving to California. Both service visits were good and on par with most high end service centers.
I blew out a tire the other evening so decided to go into Silver Star the following morning when it opened. I was greeted by a service member named Becky, and informed they did not have my tire onsite - it would arrive from the warehouse in the afternoon. My car also had a recall (that I was unaware of) and Becky informed me they would work on it while we waited on the tire.
I was offered plenty of refreshments and snacks while I waited, as well as a free shuttle anywhere in the area if I needed, however I stayed put.
Becky managed to get hold of the warehouse and they brought the tire over early in the morning, the service center worked on the recall, and I was shocked to get a text from Becky informing me that my car was being washed (complimentary) and I was ready to go before lunch! GREAT service, extremely friendly staff, and would recommend to anyone in the area.< /text>< response>

< review>
Live in the area for 35 years and have purchased three cars from Courtesy/Silver Star Chevrolet.  I have also purchased three from others because Silver Star did not have the vehicle and sadly left it to me to locate the vehicle as I wanted and needed. I have serviced all my GM vehicles at Courtesy/Silver Star over the years.  I have a leased truck that must be returned and it was leased from a different agency because Silver Star would not do a dealer trade even after I located the vehicle and told them where to find it.  Now they won't allow me to return my truck to their dealership unless I commit to buying a new vehicle from them.  The fact that I do service my Chevrolets at their agency apparently doesn't qualify me as a customer of theirs.  The fact that the car I wanted that they would not dealer trade for is apparently my fault.  Not the ideal way to build customer loyalty.</review>

As a heads up to those customers that have sports cars, you might want to choose another dealer to service your vehicle.

I had my son's Sonic serviced at Silverstar and they did a good job, oil was changed, tires rotated, car washed and ready when promised.

I figured I'd have my G8GT serviced there, and that is when it went off the rails.  They did service the car, however the car was abused while entrusted to the dealer.  The car had been driven hard, with significant tire residue left over from burnouts on the front of the mufflers.  The guilty party tried to cover their tracks by washing the rear wheel wells and zeroing out both the trip odometer and the MPG average.  However, they forgot about the undercarriage.

Additionally, I had a brand new scratch on the drivers side of the car that I had to buff out.

To add insult to injury, they told me that my rear tire wear was low...on one year old tires.  I figure the check was done after all the burnouts.

If you have an economy focused car I think you are safe with this dealer doing your service.  If you have a performance car, I'd shy away.  I know that I won't be back.</Text>

Would go no place else for service on all of our  General Motors vehicles which include a Cadillac, Chevy and Oldsmobile.  The service is the best, especially the staff.  Dominic, the Service Director is aware of everything that goes on and makes absolutely certain that the customer is satisfied.  We have been going to Dominic at Silver Star for many years and have never been disappointed....only very, very happy.  Thank you Dominic for all of your assistance and for making us feel very well taken care of.  We will stay in the GM Family as long as we can keep getting service at Silver Star with Dominic and his exceptional staff.<//Review>

I highly recommend this place, specifically ask for Addis.  He is a terrific salesman that is honest, genuine and extremely hardworking.   He went way out of his way to find us the exact vehicle that we wanted, which was no easy feat.  And having just moved to the area, we needed to return a rental car and purchase ASAP.  He worked with me on his day off to locate the car, and ultimately drove to San Diego and back to close that night.  Oh and he hung out with my kids while i signed documents during the painfully long signing process that is involved in every car purchase.  He is awesome.  He also seemed to have the support of the dealership so that is why I give the whole place 5 stars.< /Text>

Craig Florio at Silver Star Chevy was great.  Seemed very knowledgeable
and courteous.  A windshield had to be ordered.  I never had to call to see
how long it would take.  Craig called me everyday to keep me informed.
When it arrived Craig called and we set up an appointment and the
windshield was installed on time.  Had my corvette serviced at Silver
Star previously and have always had a good experience.<//text>

Excellent experience. I was quoted a price and when I was asked to pay the price was lower. The jobs were done nicely, quickly, and they even arranged for a shuttle to bring me to work and pick me up an hour later when my truck was done.< /text>

<Review>I just wanted to post up about a bizarre experience I had with SSC about a month ago which is still bugging me. I'm cross shopping for a small truck and decided to stroll over to SSC at about 2pm on a Saturday. There was literally nobody on the lot so I cruised around for about 20 minutes when I was approached by a member of the sales staff. I told him I was looking at Colorado's and wanted to see their offerings. He quickly asked what I was looking for and told me he had the exact one I wanted. I pointed out that I needed the Long bed model and wanted to Diesel. He said yeah yeah I have it. Walked over to the short bed model which was fine but I politely told him it wasn't the truck. He asked if I was a "Tire Kicker" to which left me really confused...? As I stood there trying to figure out what he meant he told me that those are hard to find, good luck, and walked away. Crossed Chevy off my list at that very moment.
Good luck SSC with your crowded dealer lot.< /Review>< Pics>

It is really bad business practice to charge someone for a diagnostic test and not being able to fix or remedy the problem.  I brought my vehicle in for repairs and you tell me that you can't fix it.   And then you charge me $165.00.  WHAT????  I have lived in Westlake Village for over 45 years and this is the kind of business you run.  Being retired on Social Security you know how to gouge the seniors.</Review>

I had my previous service rep, Bob Geary, assist in Thousand Oaks for over 10 years. I was extremely disappointed when I heard Chevy suggested he take an early retirement. It takes a while to establish trust with a service rep and we had built that trust over time.

Now I have to establish a new relationship and TRUST a new service rep?!? Christine was exceptional, helpful and knowledgeable but I would have preferred my former service rep.  I’ll give Christine & Chevy a chance over the next few visits and see if that same TRUST can be established.

The shuttle drivers in Thousand Oaks silver star Chevy are also excellent.</Review>

<review>I like bringing my work truck and gf suv here. They change the oil fast and wash our vehicles when they are done. Their prices seem fair. We usually pay around $55 to $65 for a oil change . Those other drive thru oil change places charge $45 but they dont rotate tires, wash our vehicle and who knows if they use factory recommended oil.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>I shopped around  on the internet for 4 weeks  to learn and be well informed  so I can get the best deal for my money.
After finding out what is the going price and all the charges  for the City Express LT Cargo Van with the technology package.
I called Mr. Patric Rodriguez from  Silver Star Chevrolet
I  was very impressed with his honesty, very well informed about the cargo van, competent and professional.
It was a cash deal and I needed to make sure they are hoops.
I will highly recommend Mr. Rodriguez to any one buying a car

<text>I regret purchasing my new vehicle at Silver Star Chevrolet last week, for the reason being that this dealership uses deceptive methods. The lying and deception is blatant at all the management levels. The finance manager, made changes to the final contract that I did not catch till after the fact. I was charged $695 for an optional theft deterrent device, upon inspection by myself and a Silver Star service mechanic, it turns out it is not an alarm system. When I brought this to the attention of the Sales Manager, I was informed that is a program that will repair my windows free in case they are broken into. How is this a theft deterrent device?

I was also offered by the finance manager a extended warranty program for $686 and that he would drop the APR if I chose to add it. But on the final contract the listed price was $1686. When I asked him why this had occurred, I was told he had dropped the APR rate on the loan to make up the difference of a $1000. All these actions are very deceptive, I really hope most auto dealerships don’t operate this way.

Lastly, I also had issues closing the driver’s door on my new vehicle immediately after leaving the lot. I was informed by the service department that I would have to return and leave my vehicle for the day to get it repaired. Upon returning later that day, I was informed that there was some miscommunication and that something else had been repaired that was loose, the door issue was never addressed. In the end, I agreed to leave the door alone, I decided I’ve had enough.

There are just some of the issues that occurred with my purchasing experience at Silver Star Chevrolet, unbelievably there were still more than these that I did not post.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<review>I visited several dealerships before I came to your establishment.  Every single one of those dealerships provided an excellent service. However, Mr Percy Cruz' demeanor, professionalism and impeccable customer service is second to none. On my next business for my daughter's car, I will be seeking for his outstanding service and I know I will be leaving with the best deal and confidence making car shopping an easy task.</review>< Pics>

<Text>I brought my Volt in for the replacement of an inside wheel well cover. There was also separation of the front quarter panel from the bumper and damage to areas where the bumper and panel connected. Silver Star offered two choices, a "quick fix", involving zip-ties, or the "expensive fix", replacing the bumper and quarter panel.
I opted for the "quick fix", expecting it to be only acceptable until the more expensive one. To my surprise, their work was invisible. The new wheel well part is in place, with zip-ties fastening it, from the underside, to the bumper and quarter panel. It looks and feels solid and one would not know the work was done.
In addition, the car was cleaned, inside and out...and it needed it!
These people take good care of you!< /Text>< pictures>

Art was wonderful in setting up the deal. He was straight to the point and told me what he could and could not do. We handled everything over the phone and when I arrived at the dealership, the paperwork was ready to go. He was nice enough to stay late for me as I was coming from over 30 miles away. I am planning on using him again in the next couple of months.</text>

I had the pleasure of buying a car from Rick Mueller at the Cadillac dealership and it was just that, an ABSOLUTE PLEASURE. From the moment we walked in and Rick introduced himself to the time we were walking out with the keys to our new truck- it was the best, most enjoyable, and even a little fun experience I have ever had BY FAR, out of all of the 15 vehicles I have purchased over the years. Even when it came to price, Shawn Morretti stepped in to help us get the deal done- BIG thank you Shawn! We were lucky to get our dream truck and a wonderful experience to boot!! GO HERE and ask for these gentlemen- you will NOT be disappointed.< /text>

Purchased a new Chevy Colorado. Tim the sales consultant took excellent care of me. No pressure, no sketchy deals, great service from start to finish. They offered way more on my trade-in than I ever thought I could get for it. Even Tim was shocked when the appraisal came back.

The sales manager pulled strings to get the exact Colorado I wanted in stock. The finance department was great and got me a lower interest rate than my bank saving me a thousand dollars over the life of the loan.

Excellent experience, great price, completely satisfied with my purchase!< /text>

<text>Worst service department ever. Turned my rotors without asking and destroyed my brakes. Then told me I will have to pay $500 to fix them and throwing around "good will" like they are doing me a favor. They told me this was covered the first time I went in and then trying to pawn it off on me. Left me stranded with no ride and no car. Service manager was a joke. This is the worst experience possible. Stay away !! Take you service needs and warranty items else where!!<//text>< pictures>

Thank you for an excellent experience at your dealership. My transaction was done through a professional team and I’m enjoying my ride with my Chevy Volt 2018 everyday. Special thanks to Adiss for his help. He walked me through all features and I almost sat down there and played with my cell phone while everything was done at light speed. Will definitely recommend everyone to go see Adiss for their next car purchase/lease.</Text>

Really?  You call and get put on hold twice for a total of 13 minutes, should have known then that this wasn’t going to go well.  You show up at 1:20 for a 1:30 appointment.  Your told an hour to an hour and a half for a simple oil service?  Quick Lube?  You finally ask what’s going on after no one says anything to after 1 hour 40 minutes, only to find out no one touched it!  So much for caring about customers.  My lease ends May 10th, guess where I will NOT be spending my money!!!</text>

Absolute worst experience with their internet sales team. Ready to purchase a vehicle and they refused to handle details remotely since I cannot make it into dealership until deal is worked out. With so many options to buy a car better off finding a place that will work with you and show flexiblity. Worst process to get pricing and information. They want you in person or on phone. With modern times no reason this can’t be handled remotely for busy people. Who wants to waste hours with a dealership nonsense just get to the point, make a sale and drive off. Not here apparently.</Review>

Service department leaves a lot to be desired. Went in for a oil change and a tire rotation. They left all the tires at 34psi not at 36psi as recommended by the manufacturer. Oil life was still on the dash, I have to read the manual to change it to normal.  Hard to mess up stuff this easy.  Won't be going back.< /Text>

Outstanding job in every respect. I will become a repeat customer. They did a superior job on all of the items I was concerned about. They kept me up to date on the progress with phone calls and text messages. Even though I arrived to pick up my car after hours, they opened the service department up for me so that I could get it. I can't say enough good things about them.<//text>

With such fast and reliable service, I decided to have some other general service work completed too.  To top it off, when I picked up my truck, it was vacuumed and washed.  I would definitely recommend Silver star Chevrolet for their excellent customer service and their fast, reliable, fair pricing service work.< /Text>< username>

<text>So very disappointed in this dealership. Post sales support/response is absolutely abysmal. I have been trying to get a mistake in the paperwork corrected and it has been almost two weeks and still has not been taken care of. Don't expect anyone to call you back right away. No one seems to talk to each other.</text>< user_id>

<Text>I purchased a certified pre owned vehicle in 2015 and bought an extended warranty for 60months or 100k miles. I contacted Joe in  finance  on August 21 to verify my warranty and asked questions about how I would transfer my warranty if I sold it I could or canceled it I could get back a portion of what I paid. He verified I still had 2 years left or up to 100k miles which ever comes first cause it was effective May 2015.
The following Monday August 27th I brought my car into for a ticking noise. Service pulled up my warranty as well and verified it. I later received a call that my warranty was expired in 2017. I spoke with numerous people and basically it came down to saying that my warranty started in 2012 when it was originally purchased from the first buyer! So basically they sold me a warranty the was already 3 years old! I have proof from their screen that it said effective May of 2015, 60 months or 100k.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I'd give 0 stars, if I could! Received horrible customer service from Ruben Romero. The sales contract was not properly explained, I was overtaxed and I was rushed out of his office as he refused to address all my concerns. I was charged $295 plus tax for Edge Guards, an accessory that was NOT installed in the vehicle I purchased.

When I asked Ruben Romero (finance dept) to show me the Edge Guards "installed" on the vehicle he said that he didn't have time?! I left the dealership under the impression that the Edge Guards were installed in the vehicle. However, since I could NOT feel/see any Edge Guards on the doors I went to a closer Chevrolet dealership and I was advised that the vehicle I purchased DOES NOT have Edge Guards installed.

Now, trying to get fix the issue I have called Ruben Romero multiple times, but he has refused to assist. He is the most stubborn/bitter person I have ever met, very difficult to talk to and unwilling to listen. I have also sent an email in regards to this issue to David Fooley (sales manager), but I have not received a response...

Update: Spent DAYS trying to get a call back or response from dealership manager, NO ONE assisted (not even salesperson reach out to me like he said he would). After several days I finally received a response from Mr. Panosian.  He was very kind and assisted in correcting the issue of being charged for something that was NOT installed in the vehicle I purchased. Mr. Panosian processed the refund. Although the issue was resolved, I still would think more than twice before I decide to purchase my next vehicle from this dealership. This dealership would be a better place if Ruben Romero would not be an employee there.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e8251e4e5c0863:0xe0712d47c3995b49</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Next day, service advisor confirmed that warranty will cover and it will be done by Friday or latest next Monday, if they have to order a new transmission. I picked up a regular economy rent a car in the meantime. I called back today (7) days later, Monday and the advisor tells me they still haven't brought the transmission down to know what needs to be done "because this is not a regular Chevy" he stated. Sounded like I took in a Rolls Royce Suberban. You gotta be kidding me, in seven days your technician hasn't done anything and you're telling me it can take another week. I asked if they can put me in a similar car so I can get my work done, since that's my work car. Now adviser tells me sorry it's more cost to us. Lost trust worst service ever. Other Chevy dealer will get the job done PLUS give you an equivalent vehicle in the meantime.
I'm so upset and frustrated!!! Bad bad bad</Review>< Pics>

<Text>My service advisor was Rebbeca Ispas

Outstanding...listened to me; answered all my questions; treated me with respect...I am 87.  Told me the oil change,  lube, tire rotation, and multi-point  Instepection would take about 90 minutes. I had my car back in under 60 minutes.  I received a printed inspection report, which I truly appreciated. Outstanding  service and kindness, AND
my Cruze was sparkling from the car wash they included free.< /Text>< rating>

< Review>
They are always very fast which is one of the big pluses that I like about going there. It's better to make an appointment ahead of time because if they're really busy you show up they might not get to you fast enough.

normally I would put five stars, but the prices have gone up and instead of the company incurring fees for washing the cars they have now added that to the consumer.

:-( I got a standard oil change and tire rotation plus a car wash. The wash is fairly nice but my windows are still really dirty. The oil change rate was $79, but they got me a $25 coupon so it cost me $50 period that's a lot more money than I've ever paid for all change self and then the tire rotation was $20. Yikes.

All in all they were faster than expected which was nice, but the price is a little steep for me. Thankfully I only get an oil change every 3 months<//Review>

<review>After a bad customer service from another dealer, I decided to look on line for a 2014 TRAVERSE with navigation system, & live chat pop up, I provided my information along with what I was looking for. I received an email couple of days later from Sherry Virsen asking if I had found the TRAVERSE I was looking for. Sherry & I exchange few emails & set up an appointment to meet in person so that I can see what they had on their lot. They didn't have what I was looking for, but they went ahead & look to see where they could find one for me. And they did! Very happy with their service. David Swain was really helpful too. Yesterday I met with another David (internet manager) who kept me on the look by calling to let me know when the car was arriving to their lot. He was very nice & helpful too!!<//review>< pictures>

Had a quite of an experience with them here ... The sales guy was very nice but towards the end they said they had made a mistake on the ad and basically tried to do bait and switch...  Can't believe people still play thouse games</Text>

<text>We were looking to lease a Chevy Cruze LTE to replace an aging Pontiac Vibe. We contacted other dealers in the area but they were no where near as helpful as Daniel Ybanez. His knowledge of the vehicle and finance separates him from much of the sales people we encountered at other dealers. Daniel continue to contact us after the sale to make sure everything was correct and provided additional information we requested. We will definitely work with Daniel on future leases or purchases.</text>< pictures>

< review>
I was originally referred to Silver Star through the Costco auto program. Daniel Ybanez
contacted me, and since I knew exactly what I wanted, the entire transaction was completed over the phone. He ordered me a 2013 1SS Camaro. Silver Star didn't even need a deposit. Daniel kept me informed weekly about progress, and made an appointment to deliver the car when it was convenient for me. When I arrived at Silver Star, what a presentation. My car was beautifully detailed and parked under a canopy for display and safety. Daniel explained all of the details of the car and answered any questions I had.
Next I saw Mel Otte to do the paperwork. He was as professional and friendly as Daniel. He explained everything I was signing and the extended GM warranty which I also purchased.
I was very pleased with the transaction from start to finish. I would recommend this dealership to anyone I knew who was buying a vehicle. It is no wonder that your name is &quot;Silver Star&quot;, but in my opinion you deserve a &quot;Gold Star&quot;!!
Thank you again for making this a great experience.<//review>

< Review>
Best dealer on the west side! I wanted to lease a chevy crude Eco. Silver Star Chevrolet was the best group in town they took the time i needed and explained to me all the options when getting the car. they even worked out an amazing deal that nobody anywhere in the LA and inland empire could match. only small problem is that when my current car came down to it's turn in day Silver Star couldn't find an Eco for me to take. so i unfortunately had to negotiate an extension on my current lease. as soon as that ends I plan on calling back these wonderful dealers and seeing what we can do moving forward.

if your looking for a place to get a chevy Silver Star should definitely be your first and only stop.

talk to Chris Lopez dude was on point!</Review>

<text>I want to bring to your attention an experience that I had at one of your dealers when I purchased my vehicle last week.

I leased a 2017 BOLT LT from Silver Star Chevrolet in Thousand Oaks, California on 9th August 2017. The dealer cheated me because we talked about the deal at $3500 down with $165/month payments.

Here are the 2 concerns I have
1.	The never told me that $3500 down payment would NOT include the first month payment which they took from me right away
2.	The tricked me and forced me into buying the lease protection plan for $825

I would have never known that I got cheated until my friend Rishi Goel lease the exact same vehicle with exact same features on 11th August 2017 from Simpson Chevrolet of Garden Grove and he got the exact same deal with first month payment included in $3500 down and also the lease protection plan was for $375 rather than $825 that I was tricked into buying.

Now that I have already bought the vehicle I am STUCK but I want you to be aware of the fact on how I was cheated so others do not get cheated the same way I did.<//text>< time>

After several attempts the service manager finally called me back and told I should not expect it to look as clear as my phone camera. I had to get my husband involved. They checked and there was a problem and they downloaded new software. Clearly they think women are idiots. I kept getting calls from them telling me to change the oil at 700 miles, when we took it in they said no 1500 miles.

<response>None</response><review>This space sounds great! The lobby is probably the most fun. There are so many different types of furniture in the lobby it's pretty great! The space is also historic because Frank Sinatra recorded pretty much all of his music there. Again, an awesome recording space!</review><Rate>5</Rate>< Name>

< Review>
The studio has many facets. The holiday decor was fun,  the bathroom was unlike any I've seen before and the waiting rooms were very comfortable.  The recording studio has everything necessary to record hits. The staff was kind,  helpful with instructions getting around from place to place within what first seems to be a maze. I enjoyed my time here.<//Review>

<Review>I love coming here but how I get treated depends on whose working. The younger lady that works there is extremely rude but the older lady is very nice. That's the only issue I have really but thats also why I'm only giving 3 stars< /Review>< username>

Some things never change and small places like this seem to stick around in our town. It's not always a negative thing. This is a landmark here in Merced...just saying 'Bernies' around these parts, they know exactly where you're taking about.
All your lil corner store type needs.<//text>

This was my second time in the store, the first time I only purchased food items and my experience was ok. Today I purchased alcohol, keep in mind im 39...he carded me which wasn't an issue to me, I completely understand the law but when I explained I only had a copy because my wallet was recently stolen he asked me to prove it was me by first signing the paper id to compare and then asking for any other cards with my name on it and THEN said are you sure this is you and acted like I was lying, yes my id is me with make up on and I wasn't wearing any at the time of purchase but he was so rude and accusatory that I will most definitely NOT be back!@@< /Text>

Never have craft beers in stock. Always Blame the distributor.
Save Mart has better selection and stock. Cheaper also!

Response to owner:

It wouldn't be a big deal if you were honest about things.
I've come in and bought the same craft beers from you over 10 times, and then all of a sudden you don't get any in, saying the distributor is the problem.
Bullocks!
I ask every time I'm in if you ordered it, and the response is always bs.

Jeldy jeldy. Don't be a bundurr.</review>

< Review>
It's a great place to grab most liquor that you might not have heard of, also a hard time finding someplace else.</Review>

Great liquor and grocery store. If you need cigarettes, alcohol or lottery tickets this place will have you covered. The owners are friendly and will help you find what you need inside of the store. i normally come here for a fountain drink but at other times I come in for a snack or a grab and go.<//Review>

Bernie’s liquor is OK I stop there every blue moon but basically the smog shop is right next-door to their business so I do business smog in my vehicles they have two small shops on both sides of them so basically I’m at smog shop not Bernie’s liquor by the way the staff are nice at the liquor store<//Text>

East, right after Kraft entrance, if not too busy when you go.  Dont check in before two hours from your appointment. You'll be too early. Don't  check in right at your appointment time.  You'll be marked late. I was advised to check in two hours before appointment time by the recieving clerk.</text>< user_name>

<text>The drivers keep sweeping their trash into the street, despite repeated requests not too. This is irresponsible and problematic, as we keep having to repair tires. If kraft is going to mandate that trailers be cleaned, they should provide a place to sweep them out that isn’t in the middle of the road.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Worst place ever!!! Lines take forever, people are rude & discriminatory towards female drivers. They can care less about your hours or even when you’re supposed to load according to the information you have.</text>

Walked in and service was immediate and friendly. No problems. Elsa did my mammogram who was delightful and professional.  She was kind and friendly, but always professional.
I will continue to use Breastlink for my mammograms and recommend Breastlink entirely.  👏👏👏<//review>

<Date>1592086301151<//Date><rate>4<//rate><Text>Quick check in, friendly staff, and ideally located for me!  I went to Breastlink on Westminster Ave. in Garden Grove.  Only negative was the initial call to schedule, which came from a third party scheduler(Radnet?) that tried to schedule me quite a distance from my home (Santa Ana) instead of at the facility that is about a quarter mile from me.  I would have thought the staff were more familiar with their locations.  Sound quality was very poor on the three calls it took me to schedule the appointment!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Service was one of the best I have had. It was very well organized, clean, and friendly: once my appointment was scheduled, I was provided with information online including  the medical form to fill out, so the staff already had it ready before arriving. Via text staff kept me informed upon my arrival: for safety reasons (Covid -19 prevention) they asked me to wait in my car at the parking lot or in a shade outside (that way I didn’t came in contact with any body else), then they texted me when My techno was ready for me. Once there they were friendly, no wait line at all, ready to take me in, nice and clean. I felt safe. Te Mirian was very nice and patient.  Very well done!!!< /Review>

My technician was Elsa—what a lovely lady!  I was in the building for another X-ray & the ladies at Breastlink graciously took me early. Very professional, easy procedure. The office is beautifully decorated & super clean.< /text>

I was nervous, because I've never had a mammogram, but the lady doing the exam was kind and understanding and explained everything and made me feel really comfortable!!<//review>

Very pleasant experience.  It was my first time getting exam.  Everything was pretty much done ahead of time they had already completed 90 percent of my paperwork when I arrived I just had to sign in a few places and answer some health questions I was in and out fast.  Staff was kind and efficient.</text>

They were SO friendly! The radiologist Elsa could not have been sweeter! She helped me feel comfortable plus it didn’t hurt AT ALL! Very clean office and the whole thing literally couldn’t have been better! Thank you so much for a great experience for a mammogram. I will go back!< /Text>

The people at Breast link Women's Imaging were all wonderful from the word go. I would highly recommend them. They took a very scary time and made it a lot easier. Thank you, Breastlink!</Text>

I took my mom in for a mammogram and it went very quickly. They were very polite and accommodating to my mom's needs. My mom usually doesn't talk about the service she receives wherever she goes unless it's really good or really bad. She was quite happy with her experience. When my mom is happy, so am I.</Review>

I’m 47 and For the first time I had a mammogram and my experience was  awesome!! Honestly I never wanted to go. I always try to avoid it cuz I herd a bad and painful experience from some of my friends and that’s why I was so nervous about it.. But now That I did it I  feel very happy that I went to this place because the lady  who attended me and did  the x-rays she was soo nice, so kind and careful.  Also all the stuff is so friendly and quick and the place is nice and clean.I definitely will recommend this place to all my friends.</Review>

I really did not want to make or keep my appointment for the mammogram but it had been so long since my last that I bit the bullet - took the first appointment that was available - 9:15 PM which seemed strange being so late but I went.  The office is nothing fancy but it was calming.  The staff were welcoming - the wait was brief - the tech was so sweet & made sure I was as comfortable as possible.  All in all it was a positive experience & I'm grateful.

Thank you,

It was such a comforting experience that they let me have two different appointments in one visit. I opened the door, filled out some paperwork, and went in for the tests without a wait. It took less than an hour to do both appointments. The technicians were very nice too. It certainly was a great experience.
There was one thing I was concerned about, that was when one of the technicians kept coughing and she seemed like she was coming down with something. I am still worried if I got something from her...
But anyway, thank you for the nicely done quick work.< /text>

I went in for my appt, was told bc my order wasnt signed by the doctor therefore the appt can't be done.  If it is that important than that should have been informed and requested prior to appt, how would i know to read a dr order.  No manager onsite when requested so my time to set aside to get there has no value to the front desk.<//Text>

I was well pleased by the radiologist or Mamogramoligist!! She seemed very understanding of how I felt throughout the process. I just learned today that while they have a protective device to help keep us safe during the cancer causing radiology I was never even offered it? I wonder now why it isn’t made as a mandatory part of the process. Thank you 🙏< /review>

<review>I was nervous to get my 1st mammogram at the age of 33. This facility went out of their way to get missing paper work from my doctor. They were all very professional and the nurse that preformed my mammogram was really friendly. She made everything go by super fast and pain less. I would go back to this place for sure.<//review>< pics>

I went in for my appt, was told bc my order wasnt signed by the doctor therefore the appt can't be done.  If it is that important than that should have been informed and requested prior to appt, how would i know to read a dr order.  No manager onsite when requested so my time to set aside to get there has no value to the front desk.</Text>

A mammogram is very uncomfortable  but the office and staff were gentle and did everything  they could to make the test as easy as possible. The only complaint I have is for the verbal directions to tell new patients to go to the back of her building to park or that there is an elevator in the front. Many patients are elderly and can't walk that far or climb stairs.</Text>

But i never recieved a call or email to pick up, my CD, I transferred back to Kaiser and i really need the findings of the last Mammogram from this place,  I've been pumped with Hot Flashes Meds that could turn into Cancer, u merc to keep a close look into my Mammos<//Review>

The facility is dirty, messy, the changing room door is broken. The ultrasound room is stack-up with boxes on top shelf as the patient under on the table doing ultrasound. The ultrasound room window is wide open looking out to the neighborhood. There is no trash can.</text>

The staff is very pleasant and considerate, the wait time was nothing. I was taken in immediately after I had done my paperwork. Having had MRIs taken before, in other supposedly upscale facilities, I can say that this place is by far a much nicer, much more pleasant and comfortable experience, thanks to the professionalism, caring, and considerate people who work there.

<Text>Great experience with techician inside. Very nice staff.

One problem at check in process. After waiting patiently for a good amount of time, another patient complained about waiting for 2 hours and I thought it was a good idea to come check. My name was marked done and 5 more patients after my name were also blacked out. If I didn’t get up and ask, I don’t know if I would ever get called. The staff said sorry and started on my paperwork. Seems like waiting patiently is not always good.</Text>< Pictures>

Ultra sound tech was hard to understand. Huge language barrier. She also wasn’t listening when I spoke to her. I told her what I found in my breast and she kept repeating lump when I distinctively told her I do not feel a lump. There was also a student (I’m assuming) in there quiet the whole time and this person wasn’t introduced as a student. It was really uncomfortable. When they came back into the room the “student” was smirking as though they were laughing a second ago and then tried to stop before they came in. When the tech out the line on my chest she squirt it all over my face!!!! And then said sorry but didn’t wipe it off. When I asked for an extra towel she tossed it at me. Then, at the end, the radiologist read the test for legit 2 minutes. Then came in with my results saying it’s clear. And also adding that the ultrasound isn’t the correct imaging I should be getting and that I should’ve gotten an MRI.

Won’t ever come back here. Ever.<//Review>

<Text>I love Breastlink. Checking in can be a small hassle. But, once in the back the men & women make you at ease & comfortable.  I went in today for a Bone Density test.  In 2015, Breastlink found two small cancerous tumors. They were all over it. My primary physician was not. He is no longer my primary
Things have went great. Surgery.  No reconstructed surgery. I like my scar. It's been a few years, am taking post cancer meds, to keep the cancer away.  Thank you BREASTLINK !</Text>< username>

I try to always I respectful of other people's time. I showed up before my requested check in time and sat in the waiting room until 30 minutes AFTER my appointment time and then in a secondary waiting room for another 30 minutes after that!!! I understand these things take time and delays are to be expected but that was way longer than it should have been. annoyed.< /review>

I have appointment at 5:00 pm today for my ultra sound. I have to drink 32oz of water an hour before my appointment, I was there on time and my bladder already full but I have to wait 30 minutes before the technician came.
I have been ultra sound every six months, the other 2 technicians always on time because they understand I had to drink 32oz of water an hour before I came and with my full bladder was uncomfortable and they didn’t want the next patient will be late.<//text>

<text>The place is very clean and the staff are all very nice. My only complaint is that over the last twenty or so years of taking mammogram, this is the first time I got some bruising and swelling. It took the lady three trys to get the angle right on my left breast. By which time my breastbone and surrounding tissues were already bruised.  I think either she is new or does not have a good grip or gentle touch. She is very nice however. My previous two years were perfect though.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

My primary doctor’s office didn’t send an authorization prior to my appointment, and Michelle, one of the receptionists, stayed on the phone calling multiple people for almost an hour to try and make it work. Despite the circumstances of my primary doctor’s error, Michelle went above and beyond her job. Often times, some people in the medical industry can be numb to people’s situations... Michelle proved otherwise! She’s a wonderful asset to the company.</review>

We had to wait for one hour while the technician took a lunch break.

<text>Bone Density Test, all went well. It would have been nice to have a little information as to how it was done and what to expect before my appointment. And that I  didn't need to hold my breath like you do with x-ray. And if I needed to remove my jewelry before hand.</text>< rate>

<Text>I had a breast ultrasound today.
After 1 and half of waiting, i was taken into examine room by an ultrsound tech who was  unfriendly.
I simply asked a question...she became nasty telling me that she has to do her work....
She was a robot..
Heather, manager called in for mediation,
NO MORE FRIENDLIER THAN THE TECH.
This is not a nice place to get ultrasound done.< /Text>< pics>

The front desk staff was very courteous and helpful checking in.

The imaging tech was gentle and very good at explaining what she was doing while she performed the exam.</Review>

The lady who did my mammogram for me did such a horrific job. It hurt so bad, and even though I told her, she didn’t care. I have had mammograms done for the last ten year, but it never hurt this bad. Bad patient care. Other places told me step by step what was happening and what to expect. This girl did nothing. Horrible.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I would recommend this facility to any who needs to get a breast exam. I had my first exam 31 years ago at a Memorial Hospital, it was the worst. Long lines, rude, like cattle, hurt, and was told if something sn't normal we will call you within the month.

This facility I was greeted with a warm smile n a friendly hello. I requested a special dressing for the exam, they were more than happy to assist me. They were kind, courteous, and geniuses with answering all my questions. They eased my nerves by having a conversation regarding my life and situation, and share a part of themselves. I felt like a queen and left my appointment 28 minutes after I arrived, knowning I had made a few new friends.
♡♡♡♡♡
☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆  10 stars for the entire staff. Thank you !<//text>< pictures>

Also, the patients came to have mammogram might be exposured their privacies in the public through the windows of the room.  Please cover the windows in the mammogram's room.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

They called me because they had a cancellation so I was able to come in earlier than my scheduled appointment and when I got there I was able to get in and out and the woman who took me back remembered the procedures that I had last time remembered me and wasn't trying to rush the process plus they're open till 10 p.m.< /Review>

My appointment was 9:25. I walked out the clinic was 11:00. The waiting time was very bad.  I was wondering if the receptionists go by the appointment or by the first come first service.
I also suggest that we should have a clock on the wall so the patients can record the time when sign in
