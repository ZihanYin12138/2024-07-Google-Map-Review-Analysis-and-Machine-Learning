< review>
I am visiting from out of town for the week. I picked up some flowers for a wonderful girl. I called them first to see if they had the flowers I was looking to purchase. Thank goodness they did! Other florists around told me the ones I was looking for were coming out of season. Some lovely people warmly greeted me. They had just gotten som peonies fresh in that morning. All I had to do was pick which ones I wanted. The florist behind the counter did a phenomenal work of art, adding some other elements as well as some Lilly's. I highly recommend going here for any of your florist needs!<//review>

<review>They did exactly what I’d ask for at the last minute for my girlfriends birthday since I was out of town, they delivered it to her house very fast and quickly. It was affordable and made her whole day! I am in shock. Everyone turned me down except for this place and I am so grateful.
Thank you Dave!!! I will be back.< /review>< Pics>

Went online from out fo town to send flowers to a friend.  Easy shopping and easy checkout.  Got a picture of the flowers today from my friend and they looked better then online.  Only thing is I never received an email confirmation of the order so I was a little nervous.  With everything going on these days, it was a simple process overall, and beautiful arrangement.<//Text>

<text>Ordered this beautiful arrangement for my husband and kids through Teleflora and was fulfilled through Dave's!! Its absoulutley BEAUTIFUL and AMAZING! Dare I say better then what was puctured!! (Balloon wasn't included I added it)

The ONLY issue I had was NOT THE FAULT of this florists, I ordered this particular arrangement for the vase it was advertised on Teleflora's site in. Working with a floral company in the past I understand things like that are only available as long as the supplies last. However the same arrangement w/the vase is still being sold on Teleflora's site with no mention of the possibility of it coming in a different vase. Again none of this is the florist issue. After contacting Teleflora they are sending the correct vase from their warehouse.<//text>< pictures>

I found Dave’s on the Internet and called from South Carolina.  The gentleman who took the call was so nice and understanding of why I was sending the flowers and how I wanted them to look.  He assured me he would send a really nice and unique arrangement.
My friend really loved the flowers and the photos she sent to me showed just how beautiful and exotic the flowers were. Thank you Dave’s Flower Box for bringing my friend some joy at a difficult time.</review>< Pictures>

Jim was so kind and had wonderful suggestions for additional touches with my wedding decor. He clearly has a lot of experience working with flowers for weddings, and his attention to detail is delightfully amazing. The standard bouquets already in the store are great as well, and I will be stopping by regularly to treat myself to some floral arrangements for the house after my wedding weekend.</review>

<rating>2< /rating><text>I got a big bouquet of flowers for my birthday sent over from my family in Russia. It was delivered on time, which was nice. But while the arrangement must have once been pretty, the flowers looked wilted right away and barely lasted two days. The pink roses had grey, rotting petals on the inside and even asters and stargazer lilies which usually last a long time looked far from fresh. I sent a picture to my family to thank them (from the most flattering angle), and they were disappointed saying that they had ordered a much nicer bouquet online. It's a shame, because I'm sure my loved ones paid an arm and a leg from overseas for this online flower delivery.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80d954e4ccc55adb:0x9d6906113f858e13</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

For my first experience with them, I called in with a last minute bouquet request, and gave them a price range. I let them talk me into keeping the slightly larger arrangement because they said it would work better. They tell me to wait a half an hour. I'm in a hurry, so I go down there after 15 minutes so I can leave the second they're done, and the bouquet is already waiting. It's gorgeous, and, all in all, very reasonably priced for how great it looks. Service was friendly, and I will definitely shop here again.<//Text>

One of the main reasons you choose the option to have flowers delivered is for the recipient to be able to receive all the joy, and excitement that goes with receiving flowers at work .  It is pointless to deliver the flowers when the recipient is not there, and to have somebody else sign for them. You are taking away the point of having the flowers delivered. So,  the next time that someone tells you the person will be in to work at 12:30, how about you deliver the flowers when the person is AT WORK!...not 3 hours before they arrive to work. I'll give you 4 stars because the flowers were beautiful,  I picked them out. But not five stars because you suck on the delivery... which was around $20 in addition to the flowers, and she wasn't even that far away from the shop.<//Text>

This was last year and I keep telling my friend from Reno to call you directly when he orders flowers, but I think he still uses a wire service.  The roses from the other local florists don't hold a candle to ones I received from your shop.
I plan to call the service he uses to update their files. Maybe they will list you as the florist to use here in San Diego.  I hope so!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Time>1441494949758<//Time><user_id>115326192257580901792< /user_id><Response>None<//Response></record>

Pretty much my goto spot to get flowers in the area.  Prices are fair, and the flowers always look great.  They also have great service and a good variety.</review>

I ordered online for delivery, and they produced a beautiful, interesting arrangement that my girlfriend loved!  The delivery guy also gets points for carefully checking on the phone what was a safe place to leave it.<//Review>

<text>Walked in and waiting to be acknowledged but never was. The older guy just looked at me, and then went back to reading his paper. The lady was on her phone and never looked up once.

DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY: I purchased flowers for my wife for Valentines Day online on 2/5/18. DFB never delivered the flowers. I called the store and asked for a manager to call me back on 2/14/18. I never got a return call. I called my bank and disputed the charges. To this day I have never heard back from DFB. However, looking at my bank, DFB has the audacity to fight the dispute for flowers they NEVER delivered!

BUYERS BEWARE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!<//Text>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>We visit Jane quite often for good food and a pleasant environment. The bar is good, with a sure hand and eye producing fine cocktails.
On this occasion though, it became apparent that there were a few flaws.  I had the veal marsala and my wife had the special Hawaiian swordfish.  Whilst both were tasty, the basic flavors of the meat and fish were completely shrouded by the sauces.  My veal could have been almost any light meat, the swordfish any firm fish. As I said, tasty, but a bit of a let down.
The desert, a semi-freddo with caramel was delicious,  but not a semi-fredo.
We'll go back, but without great expectations.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Jane has great food with good presentation and flavor along with a lively yet relaxing atmosphere. They have a wonderful cocktail and drink menu. The staff is very pleasant, always there to greet you with a smile and do the most they can to make for a happy tasteful experience. Recommend for any occasion.</review>

<UserId.>110635643184041676815< /UserId.><Rate>3</Rate><review>Though my experience at Jane at the Marketplace has been mostly positive, today in celebration of my sister's birthday...I have a few exceptions.
First of all I must say that our server, Catherine did a very good job. She was cheery, and informative. Ditto the dude in charge running the front end.
I have always liked the environment here: big space, cloth napery and good quality glass and cutlery. A mid priced  restaurant with the class to fill the space with touches that make a difference in our overall enjoyment.
There were 4 of us today and we ordered:
Med Pizza
Blackened plank Salmon with french fries and Mango/Citrus coulis
Turkey Cobb with Gorgonzola
Red Onion Rings
Coconut Cake
Last time here i ordered the (i assume) Special Pizza which was a pretty spectacular Prosciutto, Mushrooms on a white, cheese sauce. A very delicious item. (i've attached a photo of this pizza to this review along with the Med pizza)
This Med Pizza was a major disappointment. The crust was lifeless and tasteless and was an odd tan color: as it it were whole wheat which it doesn't seem to be based on the menu description. Something was off with this dough: not leavened enough? Leavened too much?
The Buffalo Mozz was good but there just wasn't enough Olive tapenade to make an impression. Worst of all, the greens were dry when they should have been dressed. Even dressed with just olive oil, salt and pepper. Where was the Balsamic?
My sister very much enjoyed the Salmon and found the Mango/Citrus  sauce a tasty accompaniment to the fish. The Salmon was of excellent quality and grilled as ordered. A very good dish.
The Turkey Cobb was good: all of the accoutrements were prepared very well though the Gorgonzola pieces were ridiculously big. Odd to be sure. Also the Turkey was good: obviously not deli turkey but either bought or cooked in house. The greens were crispy and fresh.
The Firestone Red Onion Rings are once again pretty perfect: light, well seasoned batter but also fried very very well. This item is a prime example of a simple dish elevated to ultra goodness because all of the pieces are handled with care and in a careful, thoughtful manner.
The Coconut Cake arrived with a candle which was unlit and no one from the staff to sing Happy Birthday. Huh? a 200 buck lunch ($50 check average for each of us 4) and no one could spare the time?
Despite that, this cake is as coco-nutty as you can get. The cake itself was tender, fluffy and redolent of coconut . Both the buttercream and filling were delicious. The portion of cake sits in a milk-style sauce jam packed with coconut flavor. No artificial coconut "extracts" in sight or in the taste of this cake!
I can see  why people love this item.<//review><Response>{'time': 1596047023578, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write this. I will address all of the food issues you had with the chef.

<text>We had dinner here and we're very surprised with the quality and taste of our dishes. We started with their salmon pancake which is exactly what it sounds like and it was awesome. It has smoked salmon, goat cheese, a pancake base, and caviar roe. For dinner I had chicken with capers, lemon sauce, fettuccini. Wife had a seafood medley style soup. We shared a gluten free chocolate cake which was dense and very sweet.
The prices were completely reasonable, especially for the quality. The ambiance was nice as well. We sat out on the covered patio with heaters. This is a good place for a family too. We will definitely be coming back.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The atmosphere is casually elegant without being pretentious. The menu is thoughtfully curated which results in entrees and salads that are delightfully delicious.

Service was great, prompt, and friendly. Drinks were fine. The food was not good. The kitchen made some odd, bland choices. We got the mushroom pizza that I really didn't like, which is odd considering I like anything that has mushrooms on it. The quality of ingredients wasn't the problem - I just felt like the kitchen didn't know what food was.</text>

<review>I am from out of town. Jane at marketplace was recommended to me, so I tried it  that time of year is wonderful. the staff was very nice and the service was excellent. I had the fish and chips and they were very greasy and there was something bitter in the fish flavor.  I noticed several other males what did look very good.  however I won't be able to try any other dishes I think it's worth a try< /review>< Pictures>

I have had the chicken picatta TWICE it was so good! I don't know what other reviewers are talking about. My wife had the baked Alaskan Halibut- awesome! Service was excellent. Wine pours could be a bit more generous, but lots of local restaurants are a little stingy in that regard. We will be going back !<//Review>

Enjoyed brunch here this morning. Very very good. Atmosphere was pleasant, servers were polite and attentive. Food was outstanding. We started with the eggplant pate & olive tepanade which was incredible. I had the Frenchy omelette, perfect and the scalloped potatoes were very good. My wife had the chilequiles, and with the tomatilla sauce. She enjoyed them very much . The coconut cake with vanilla sauce to finish was the perfect way to wrap it up. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience there andand absolutely reccomend this place well.</text>

I’ve been to this restaurant twice and my experience was wonderful both times. On this visit, I ordered the Grilled Chicken plate for dinner. It was absolutely delicious. It had a light cream sauce that was delicate and complimented the Anaheim chiles and chicken. The roasted potato side had so much flavor, I could have easily eaten 10 more servings. For dessert, I had the pecan tart, which had just the right level of sweetness. The service is excellent as well, I’d highly recommend eating here!</Text>

Jane has become our "Friday night" dining special restaurant.  My sister usually orders goat cheese pancakes and I love chicken piccata with lemon caper sauce.  Recently I substituted scalloped potatoes for pasta..wow, I love the way Jane does potatoes.  We usually arrive before 5:30 so we can get in on the happy hour options.  When we leave the place is packed and there's a line out the door.

I highly recommend Jane for the food, service, and ambience.<//Text>

The burgers here are absolutely amazing. Great flavor and variety. I haven't tried their appetizers yet, but they have a large, varied selection to choose from. The location is nice, with a beautiful patio. Service is generally very good, but we have had a few experiences of having to wait a long time for follow-up twists like drink refills, the check, etc. I would highly recommend this place of you are looking for fresh, high quality food and a generally great experience.< /review>

The people are nice and the place is cute, but the food was mediocre at best.  We seriously waited about 45 minutes for the food to come out and when it did the recommended steak frites were well done when we ordered medium rare.  I would not go again.</review>

Very disappointed with our experience at Jane.  We had planned to  celebrate our granddaughters birthday at Jane.  Granted we should have asked but we brought her requested family cake and was informed that the restaurant had their own pastry chef and there would be a $20 charge if we wanted to consume the cake we had brought at the restaurant.  I returned my cake to the car and thought we would make the best of it without our family cake!  Unfortunately, our experience did not improve when our dinner was served.  The food was very mediocre.  The pizza was tough and greasy, the pork sandwich was fatty and the filet was the caliber one would expect from a chain restaurant. There was no recognition of our granddaughters birthday from the restaurant,  not even a scoop of vanilla ice cream! $225 later we went home and enjoyed our traditional birthday cake. Would not recommend Jane based on our experience!<//review>

<text>This is a good choice if you are in the Goleta area.  We shared the oysters to start, and for the main courses we had the flank steak in chimichurri sauce and the mixed seafood and vegetable stew in coconut cream broth. All were excellent. The wine list was very good, in fact it was better than at a more expensive restaurant we dined at off State Street in downtown SB.< /text></record>

Jane is one of the best Farm to Table places in Santa Barbara. Their food quality is great and it is always fresh. The only reason my rating is low is two times I have been served chicken in my vegetarian order for which they apologised but that doesn't change the fact that the Waitress made a mistake.
Anyway, I still go there occasionally but everytime I am there my fear of having issues with my order are always doubled.</Review>

Very nice atmosphere! Polite servers. I didn't give 5 stars because the pizza came with a whole lot of kale, which I don't like at all! I believe the kale was not mentioned in the menu and that's why I didn't know about it.<//Text>

The food was good not great. I had the smoked salmon and prawn salad. The service was not good at all. We sat there waiting to be acknowledged but the server waited the 15 minutes for the happy hour to end even though the pair of ladies next to me ordered off the happy hour menu. It was disappointing.<//Review>

The few times that I went, the food did not live up to the downtown location. Everything is just a little off. For example, the chicken picatta is tasty but super greasy and the burgers were good, but since they were out of buns, we ate them on ciabatta.

Service is pleasant in the restaurant, but when we tried to plan a private party there, the communication was terrible, and I felt we were treated badly and blamed for things that weren’t communicated to us properly. Fortunately, we had a mountain of email evidence that proved it wasn’t our fault, and only then did they become apologetic. It was ultimately resolved to our (somewhat) satisfaction, but I was disappointed in the customer service overall.< /Text>

One of the best happy hours in town.  Lunch and dinner here are fantastic.  The pizza and greek salad are highly recommended. Great service too.  Highly recommended by a SB/Goleta local.</review>

I feel badly writing this because I've always been fond of this restaurant, however last Friday I was turned down at the door because they could not accommodate my baby in his stroller. The patio was closed due to the fire and they had a private party in the other room, however there were tables available in the main room and the hostess turned us away. I feel this is definitely a form of discrimination.< /Review>

<Name>cristina chapman< /Name><Review>This is the second inedible meal I've had at Jane. I had the fresh fish sandwich. It was not fresh! Coated with so much mayonnaise and butter I couldn't taste the fish. It made me feel sick to eat that much mayonnaise. I told the waitress and only ate 2 bites but they didn't adjust the bill at all. Not impressed.< /Review>< resp>

Jane has some of the very best food in Santa Barbara and the setting and ambiance in both restaurants makes a perfect date night. But seriously...the food!<//Review>

Excellent food, wood oven pizza and salad.  A little pricy but worth the $. Great selection of food and nice servers.  The coconut cake is incredible.</text>

I bought Fuel wheels online with Jason and he was able to get me an excellent price on the wheels and lug nuts! Shipping was fast and the wheels were well packaged, communication was very responsive and he had incredible knowledge on the fuel line-up.<//Text>

< Review>
Daniel came recommended to me by a friend from high school.. so glad I checked out his shop.. they do quality work, are super nice and helpful, great prices, and the best thing is his suggestions are all about helping you not making money.. I was thinking about adding a control arm and adjustable lower control arms to fix a steering issue.. with would of been 700 plus labor, Daniel suggested using a boot kit that cost 36.99 and accomplished the same goal.. he could of made money on the parts and extra labor, but he choose to educate me and help me.. to me that’s the most important thing you can ask for when choosing a shop to work on your vehicle.  They are my go to for anything on my Jeep .. integrity is everything!<//Review>

Overpriced, quoted me at 4 hours for a job that literally takes about 1.5 hours at the most. These guys just want to drain you instead of finding and keeping customers.<//review>

Daniel went above and beyond making sure I found the rims that I wanted for my new car! Truly an incredible establishment that legitimately cares about their customers. Extremely competitive not only with their services and selection, but their prices as well. Thanks for restoring my faith in customer service. Signature will be my go to place from here on out.</review>

The service there is truly the best. They are very helpful and go above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied and do not pressure you Into anything you don't need or can't afford. Daniel there is one of the nicest guys I've met, just really someone who genuinely cares about your needs, and their shop foreman Dale is an expert when it comes to making your ride look amazing, be it a lift kit or some sick 24" wheels, he won't quit until it's perfect.

<text>This place is awesome. The service you get there is top notch. They truly do care about the customer, before, during and after the sale. They're prices are reasonable depending on your taste.

<Review>I personally know the owner and I have seen him grow into a amazing man and a consummate professional in his trade. I would be comfortable taking any vehicle to his establishment for aftermarket upgrades and maintenance. I hope this review helps anyone looking for a reputable shop with a customer first attitude. Signature Performance Tire and Wheel is a great spot. Keep up the good work Daniel and crew!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>I worked with Jason from across the country and he had the patience and formidable knowledge of his products to make me comfortable in making my first custom wheel purchase. I was concerned but knew what I wanted and he assured me of exactly what I would get. That's what I got and it's been about five months since installation and I still haven't had a day of regret. Very good experience overall. I'd easily say I'd do it again but it's just not a service made for repeating often. Nonetheless, I'd definitely recommend anyone to deal here.< /Review>< pictures>

I highly recommend this place if your looking for a lift on your vehicle. They did a nice job lifting and adding new tires and wheels to my Subaru Outback. Really happy with the outcome.</review>

<Text>I love this place because they are honest and don't try to rip you off like most auto places. Daniel & Jason are amazing they know a lot and they sit you down and go through what needs to be down on your vehicle. Also they have a amazing financial payment solution if you can't afford what needs to be done. It's called SNAP FINANCIAL GROUP it's  Up to 80% approval for bad credit and no credit at all. So go in and ask for Daniel or Jason.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf198ca609f3:0x69ccf69a343caff< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Jason was very professional and helpful with tire and wheel selection. When the wheels came in and were wrong he personally drove to the manufacturer and picked up the right ones and then picked up my truck, did the work and dropped it off when they were done. Real top notch service!<//Text>

<Review>Never again. I’ve bought 2 sets of wheels and tires. First set came with busted up center caps and they actually replaced them but it took them over 3 months so I rode around with no caps that whole time. I just purchased my last set from them which again came with a center cap issue and I had to ride around a week with no cap. Deal breaker for me was my tires were very out of balance. I have been to 2 different shops and they won’t balance out right. They offered to pay for nothing of course. So now I have a truck that vibrates like crazy going down the road. Buyer beware they may be cheaper but you get what you pay for!!!< /Review>< user_name>

I purchased a set of 6 Monster Mayhem dually wheels and 35" atturo tires. Upon delivery there were a few issues with luh nuts not coming correct and a wheel with damage. I sent Daniel the information. He never go back to me. Now at less that 5000 miles the front tire started to sperate. I've left a message with Daniel but not holding my breath . Very unhappy customer after spending so much .</Text>

They installed them free of charge, 3 hours labor free, amazing! The installer did a stellar job, he explained what he was going to do, then walked me through step by step and showed me what he did. Quality workmanship, exceptional customer service. On top of that he saved the bar code from the box and informed me of a $100 rebate I was not even aware of, cha ching. Thank you Signature Performance, I couldn't be happier with my power running boards.< /review><Rating>5</Rating><time>1449862040651</time><user>111898066759867163540<//user><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

There are not enough stars to give SPTW, Daniel took care of everything my truck needed (wheels, tires, level lift, and tint).  I dropped it off before work and picked it up at the end of the day.  Great service and great people, I will recommend SPTW to everyone I know!!<//review>

<Text>I purchased a set of Foose Wheels for our new Yukon several months ago.  I had a custom job and the whole SPTW team took great care of us.  My wife is extremely happy with her vehicle thanks to their great service.

Last week, our psi was down and realized we had a nail in her rear tire.  I was able to swing by SPTW and within minutes they had thrown my car onto the rack and repaired our tire free of charge.

Getting good quality, reliable AND affordable service these days is a rare find but this company knows how to take care of its customers.

Thanks Rob, Daniel and JD for getting me back on the road so quickly!</Text>< Date>

<Review>I had an issue with a competitor of SPTW. I had special ordered wheels and the vendor billed me and never delivered. I went around and around to get no where. MHT had the wheels but could not sell them to me because I wasn't a vendor. After several phone calls to MHT they referred me to Daniel at SPTW. He was super!!! He negotiated with MHT for me, got be the best deal available and had the wheels shipped (with tracking numbers) the next day. Even though I had a horrible experience, my wife cried and cried about, Daniel made it a positive outcome that I could live with and.... my wife is happy! The wheels were for her. THANK YOU Daniel!!!!<//Review>< gmapID>

Too my Mercedes G55 to these guys.  Was initially leary about taking the vehicle to a shop that was non-MBZ.  Had them mount, balance and align the tires I ordered, and install a steering stabilizer (org one wore out).  Could not be happier.  These guys were professional and I'd trust them to do any suspension/wheel work.<//text>

These guys are great! I've gotten several gel manicures here. The spa is very nice and clean. All of their equipment is new and you can tell they work hard to keep everything nice. I got a pedicure too the last time I went and the classic pedi. The staff is incredibly sweet. I've had all 3 of them do my nails now and they're all great. I can't recommend them enough.< /review>

Love doing my mani with Lucy! She's the best and always leaves my nails exactly how I like them. When I would do gel, I would do them with Emily and she was my favorite! Love her. Out of all the nail salons I've been too, this one has been my favorite and I've been going here for about 2 years now. All the other techs are great, but they just happen to be my favorite. Color selection is okay, and price isn't bad considering I'm always satisfied with my nails when I leave here.<//review>

I often pass the shop on my way home and liked how it looked from the outside. I came in to get my nails and feet done for my birthday and fell in love with the atmosphere and the customer service. This is my second time and I'm still in love. Even brought two new customers. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking.<//Review>

<Text>Nancy is a miracle worker. I was recommended to her by one of my friends over 10 years ago. I have been getting my eyebrows done from her and only her. I have consistently received compliments on how perfect they are.EVERY time someone ask me where I get them done, I always refer them to Da-Vi. but I always always always ask for Nancy. If she's not there, I don't get them done. I get them waxed and dyed and they come out perfect every time</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f79c71a2e7a75:0x25da607afa56b86< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<text>This place is crazy! The workers are rude and they obviously talk about there clients.  They are way over priced. $60 for a pedicure and $45 for nails. I have been here more the a couple times only because there is a lady there named keren that dose really good nails. I keep hoping the experience will get better but it just seems to get worse. I think I would rather go to a place where I am comfortable and feel relaxed then do this again.< /text><Time>1561237865001< /Time><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x808f79c71a2e7a75:0x25da607afa56b86< /Gmap_id>< name>

<rate>1< /rate><text>I came here with a friend to get a full set. Let's start by saying that the man who greeted us was very nice and placed us at tables right away. He said our techs would be with us shortly. My friend had someone working on her nails within five or so minutes, however, it took nearly 30 minutes before anyone got to me. I knew what I wanted (shortish almond nails, fairly simple - I had a pic and everything). The tech who worked on my nails was rude, barely said a word to me the entire time.
My second issue was with the color - I chose a muted bluish-green, however it was actually a bright teal that had been painted on the tester so long ago that the light had made it the muted color I liked. I didn't realize this until after she'd already started.
Third, and probably the worst problem I had, the nails (acrylic nails) all came off within 10 days. I believe the first one popped off (like an $8 Sally Hanson glue on nail set that you get at Walgreens) after about 5 days. It literally peeled off and took an entire layer of nail with it. I probably could have glued it on like one of those cheap press-on because the entire nail came off in one piece.
This manicure just didn't last and it wasn't a pleasant experience to get them done. I would recommend finding a different salon.<//text>< Pictures>

HORRIBLE. Do not go here. I went in to get 1 nail fixed and they were rude unprofessional and unsanitary. She scratched up my other nails and the one she did is thick as hell, and is also longer and bigger than the rest. I knew it wasn't going to be perfect but i am appalled and how bad this is</Text>

Please! If you know better. Go elsewhere. The women are rude! I went there to have my gel removed. I was charged $25.00. She didn't even take all the gel off. I also asked her to file my nails short & round. She kept making the nails pointy like a knife. I even showed her the picture of what I wanted. She kept shaping them with sharp point on them. Then she put a clear coat of polish over it. My nail felt like sandpaper because she didn't remove all the old gel.  When I told the manager. He said it will come off in time. Also a nail salon were the girl wear Daisy Dukes? That's not good business attire! I will never go back!!</text>

That’s the worse place to do nails at... I contact health department they don’t clean the equipment she took me at we another customer and she didn’t clean anything just start my nails ... then the customer complains that she didn’t like the color so she left me without saying anything all I saw is her leave to me sitting and go start fixing the customer nails. When u talk to the guy at the reception he start yelling at you. Why should I pay money to be yelled at!!!! They don’t deserve even a star</review>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>I walked in to get my nails shortened, a fill, and a different gel color. I liked that I was sat down as soon as i got there considering how busy it was. I had long acrylic ombre French tip sharp angular coffin shape. They clipped my nails, they started to smooth out the nail bed and I told the nail tech I didnt want them to touch my cuticles but they didnt listen to my request, my thumb cuticles ended up cut and bloody. The application of the gel polish wasn't great they did a couple of layers I suppose to ensure it wouldnt chip. But the nails came out round and clumpy which isn't my personal taste I was trying to keep the nails a short square angular shape.  And when I had left the my hand grazed something and I looked at my nails and noticed that due to how clumpy the nail was an indentation was made. Due to my own time constraints and because how busy they were, I didnt find it reasonable to stay there to nag them for what I wanted since I was already there getting serviced for an hour. I was charged 40 + tip. Honestly I wasnt happy with my nails but i was in a time crunch and this was the closest spot available.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808f79c71a2e7a75:0x25da607afa56b86</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The lady who assisted me was so RUDE, I was looking for a refill and she kept saying I needed a new full set, she violently teared off the previous nails and while I was telling her it was painful she kept on going, she was pulling my hand every time she could, I accidentally bumped my nail into the lamp and she was very upset to redo one single nail, she started yelling in her language, which, of course, I couldn’t understand but I was certain she was talking about me, it was so annoying.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>DON'T GO THERE THEY LIE ABOUT PRICES. THEY WILL SCAM YOU!!!! 35$ GEL FULL SET BUT IF YOU LUKE COFFIN SHAPE U HAVE TO PAY 55$ SO DISRESPECTFUL. AND WHY DID THE TECH ONLY RUB LOTION ON ONE LEG AND CHARGE EXTRA FOR BOTH LEGS. IM SO LIVIDED THESE PEOPLE ONLY WANT TO STEAL YOUR MONEY. DONT LET ME FORGET TO TELL YOU HOW THEY LIKE LAUGHING IN YOUR FACE WITH THEIR NASTY BREATHE. ITS ASHAMED LOCALS CANT GET A DECENT NAIL SALON WITH HONEST SERVICE.< /text>< Date>

I had a horrible experience here.... as soon as I walked in they rushed me to a chair , the lady doing my nails (Leslie) rushes while gluing my nails on . one of my hands the nails were so crooked it looked like they were throwing up gang signs... my pinky nail was pointing straight up ... it’s 35 for full set with regular nail polish and 45 full set with gel polish.. I got the gel polish because they literally only showed me the gel polish as if it was the only option even after I asked for regular nail polish .... I don’t know how but my gel polish had air bubbles in it .. it’s was just a horrible experience DO NOT GO HERE< /review>

My mother got her nails done and expected to get a french manicure and they told she could not afford it. So they made her pay for a manicure that looked like white out had spilled on her nails. Crazy people for discriminating my mom!<//Review>

Took my daughter here to get her hair braided for the first time and it look fantastic!! The ladies make you feel like home and they really have a passion for what they do. I will definitely come again and I highly recommend this braiding salon!!</text>

<Text>This was my first ever salon experience in my life, and the ladies were so nice and helpful; friendly, and gentle. My hair looks so bomb and so excited to share my selfies with my friends, this place is a great place to come and get your hair done! Bonus they did the exact style that I wanted, exactly how I envisioned it.

<text>Teza is the BEST in Sacramento. She knows all the latest styles. So neat and clean braiding. It’s worth every dime I spent. Teza is the ONLY person I will let braid my hair but this is a family affair and I love the positive energy. Black owned and operated!! They are sisters and these SISTAS can braid! This is the place to go. One stop!</text>< pictures>

From Florida, I needed knotless plaits! I found Teza African Braiding Salon on Google. I contacted her, she got me right in! Very professional, and friendly! She got me in and out! Her braids are very neat, I’m completely satisfied. I’ll recommend this braiding salon to anyone in the California area!!!!<//Review>

I showed them a picture of the braids I wanted and they made it happen for me! The braids were neat and the women were friendly. However, they're a bit pricey in comparison to some other braiders. Overall, I recommend this salon.< /review>

Unprofessional. She makes appointments then has you sit for three hours.  Still doesn't do the work or follow up.  Simple corn rows for a child is 100. Please.  That's robbery. Negative  50 stars.< /Review>

<text>Ishia and Teza are awesome!! All I can say is yesterday I met them for the first time, but it feels as if I've known them a lifetime. Ishia did an awesome job on my hair. I came in for individuals and she advised due to length of my hair it may not work. She actually did them a little smaller and they're EXACTLY what I expected. She was even careful with my thin edges. I most definitely will be a long time customer!< /text><userid>110085222032750715202</userid><Response>{'time': 1613441166378, 'text': 'Thank you'}</Response>< username>

<text>I hate leaving bad reviews but unfortunately I had a very bad experience with this salon. I called and got a last minute appointment to do two simple braids (cornrows) with attachment. I brought my own hair and was told it would cost $65. I thought the price was outrageously high but I was desperate. I arrived at the time I was told to come only to be left waiting for over 30 minutes by a customer who had walked in minutes prior. When I finally started to get my hair done the person doing it clearly did not know what she was doing. She redid the left braid 3 times. When she was done I looked in the mirror and what I saw was something that resembled a child's work. Uneven, sloppy, messy braids. I contacted the owner with a picture of the work hoping for a refund, or even an apology for what her apprentice did. I got NOTHING. No response. I would stay far away because this place is expensive for no reason with subpar quality.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Teza is very respectful and extremely good at what she does. My hair is beautiful!!  She gripped every bit off hair and made me feel comfortable. It does not hurt! Teza and her mom and sister are so cool and straightforward! If anyone is looking to get there hair done this place is the place for you! African braids are not cheap but they do last for about 3 months! It’s in the way they braid and it’s up to you to trust them and also to know that you are indeed in good hands! They are fast 3-4 hours for single whew Chile I am super fine and I thank them so much for accepting me thank you teza and her mom and sister! See you guys soon!!!< /Text>< pics>

I’m very skeptical about letting new people do my hair. However, I decided to give Teza a try based on her pics of previous clients. I’m so glad I did. She was so pleasant, personable, funny and professional. She just created a client for life. When I say she just laced me and got me in and out. I’m super tender headed (Don’t judge next) but she was gentle, but braided tight. How? Not sure but the girl is magic! I will be back after these grow out and there after. Thanks Teza see you next time boo! XOXO</Text>

<Text>Teza is the most talented African braider in Sacramento! If you can grip short hair and braid it you’re good! Not one braid has fallen out since I’ve gotten service from her. Therefore, she is my only choice. I wouldn’t have anyone braid my hair but her! If you’re not Teza you can’t touch my hair!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x809adb14409c9ed7:0xe739cf88221fa002</Gmap_id>< Date>

DONT GO HERE.!!! If you are are black women who wants to keep your healthy hair. All they care about is how fast they do your hair. They either don't care about the health or don't know how to take  care of healthy hair. Either way dont go.< /Review>

So I decided after 20 years, to get my hair braided. I started my search for a hair braider not knowing what I wanted but knowing that when I saw it, I found it! I started searching on Thursday night and found Teza's photos of her work on Friday morning. She was able to get me in on Friday afternoon and the rest is history! She listened to what I wanted and gave me just that. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair and gave out her information to everyone who wanted it!

I am still getting compliments on my hair 6 weeks after having my hair braided. She is the best at what she does! I love her & her work. You will not be disappointed. Call her today to schedule an appointment. Thanks again Teza! God bless you!</Text>

<Review>Teza and her staff are awesome! My first and 2nd visit with her was great. I just recently had my third visit with Teza. Every time I'm extremely impressed with the work she does. I would recommend her if your looking for a braider Teza is the one she's always courteous to her clients.< /Review><date>1568865568567<//date><GmapID>0x809adb14409c9ed7:0xe739cf88221fa002< /GmapID>< rating>

<Name>Tyreen Hodge<//Name><Review>I have been getting my hair braided by Teza for about 6months now. Each experience has always been great. I'm always happy after I get out the chair. She braids pretty fast and they are always neat. I get ALOT of compliments everytime. She is also kind and have great customer services.  I have witness her interact with multiple clients that walk in as well as on the phone. She is the only person I go to for braids in Sacramento. If you are thinking braids or dreds. give her a try. Her salon is clean and conveniently located and fairly priced. You won't be disappointed.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate><date>1576187388711<//date><Response>{'time': 1576192630835, 'text': 'Thank you honey'}<//Response>< GmapID>

Docks are kept clean and security patrols at night. Office staff were very helpful from application all the way to move out. Rate is probably the best you’ll find in San Diego for a small boat too. Plus access is right off the highway, and you’re 3 minutes from a West Marine and 10 from Home Depot, if you’ve got more of a project boat. Overall would recommend to anyone looking for a slip.</review>< Pictures>

Best marina in SD hands down. I’ve had my sailboat there for 3 years. Clean, safe, gated. Excellent parking. Bathrooms are spotless. Andy the dock master takes pride in managing to keep the place in top notch shape. Leah and the rest of the staff also clearly are passionate about outstanding customer service. Great bar and restaurant in the marina next door only a 5 min walk. Quick and easy 5 min drive to tons of stores and restaurants in Chula. Fair prices for slips. It just doesn’t get much better than this.<//Text>

< Review>
This has been our marina for about a year now. The marina grounds are kept beautiful! The staff are friendly and always willing to lend a hand. There are laundry facilities a small gym and showers. Everything is kept very clean. The marina is gated with key only entry which makes us feel safe. The boaters in the marina are all friendly and considerate of you and your boat. The location is great easy access to stores, restaurants and banks. The slip fees are average cost for  San Diego call for fees because they can change. And depend on your boat size. We love it!!!<//Review>

The staff is amazing, always ready to help and go above and beyond to keep this place spotless and accommodating. I was in Mission Bay for 5 years which had it's pluses and minuses. I am really liking this location and the proximity to all kinds of goods and services. There is no airplane noise like mission, shelter and harbor all experience. I enjoy bay sailing and all the bay has to offer, so for me that is another plus. California Yacht Marina is a solid value and a terrific place to dock!! They even had a Holiday light promotion that encouraged decoration, mine is the smaller sailboat.</review>< user_id>

Excellent customer service! I got married over 3 years ago here and it was an amazing experience. The yacht view during sunset was phenomenal to the eyes. Our wedding evening was a night we won't forget. The staff was kind and friendly. They worked well with us during all the rushes and stressful situations for this event. We loved and enjoyed our time here. The Nautical theme pavilion and its round tables that came included were perfect. I highly recommend this place for those who want a bay view scenery and a pleasant evening event by the water. Thanks CYM!< /text>

< Review>
In town for medical needs and needed some beads to work on my fundraising efforts. Found this gem of a local shop. She is so nice! I'll be down here a lot so sad to learn she will be closing her doors end of Nov. I wish her well on her new journey!</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Beautiful beads that I couldn’t buy. I was having issues with my bank and they for some reason marked my card as lost or stolen. She said she couldn’t give the card back to me under any circumstances. I was so upset my husband had to call our bank, and by the time he spoke with someone who said that is absolutely not true, and that if I show proof of my ID I can get the card back. Well I did, and it was already in pieces. Just 1 day before we left for a trip across the country. This women basically stole and destroyed my card due to her misinformation. She’s lucky I didn’t call the police. She could have talked with someone from her bank, she could have tried anything to help, but instead she was condescending to me when I started to get upset and acted like there was nothing she could do, and she ordered me to call my bank to ask for a new card, trying to not get me to ask questions about this circumstance to my bank. Not saying this will happen to you if you go there, but this is the kind of person who runs this shop. The shop dog there had FAR better customer service than this woman.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ29SIPv2z-Bu7y_qVW1obS_45oPJVaSwTgxei=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>I love this store and have since I was a child.  Beautiful beads, antiques, kitchen items, and art from all over the world.  The kind of store I go to just to enjoy being there, but never end up leaving with nothing.  Some of what they have is very pricey, but some of it is surprisingly affordable.  Take your time looking around!  Fun store, and they're incredibly nice to children, particularly given how many breakable things they carry!< /review>< resp>

I loved this Bead store!!! I bought a necklace at a different store, but I needed earrings to go with it. I stopped in Global Beads last week, and the woman (I think Maggie) was wonderful! She spent so much time with me choosing matching beads and putting it all together.  She is so knowledgeable and knew exactly what would work. Got compliments as soon as I walked into work Tuesday.  I'll try to attach a picture.< /review>

This place is so cool it brings out the Gearhead in me. Yes yes beads are for girls!! but there are just so many cool different types of beads in this store!! They even had old Chinese coins to make things out of!!
As I walked around I spotted a hand made, really cool bird, made from some kind of semi-precious Stone and sterling silver. Just had to have it C: so it flew home with me C;</Text>

I love global Beads!  Everyone that works there  is so helpful and kind. I've taken many classes there  where I've learned so much. I just took this class this week. It was so fun!  The other people in the class were so nice too. If you need help this is the place for o go because you will receive excellent service.<//Review>

<Review>Adorable vintage shop on Castro street. Lots of floor space allows this store to offer everything from furniture to housewares, there are a bunch of treasures to find here. There is also a big section for beads and trimmings for craft or sewing projects. The staff are really nice and friendly, and the prices are not terribly expensive either! I'll be back for sure 👍< /Review></record>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I Love this store. The  some beads are brought in from Africa, and other countries . They have gold findings available  for a special piece i want to make, and I've bought  replacement gold findings to repair jewelry I need to repair   myself. This is a nice way to save money, by not using a jeweler  . was speaking to the owner who has a passion for beads and creates  pieces herself.  The added Antiques  is a welcomed surprise , since there are not  Antique shops easily found in our area. The prices are higher than  cheaper quality beads found at Joann's and Michael, however , the prices are reflective in the quality and fact that they come from Africa, India ,and where ever the owner can find  unique beads and art  work. If you have a broken piece of Jewelry, the owner, Kathlene,, will help in it's repair. This is a cool store. I'm glad to have it close to where I live.<//text>< user_name>

<Text>Looks like this place has a set amount of customers that they cater to and are not interested in growing any more. The lady at the counter was too busy with someone else to help and when she finally did, it was too sure they don't carry such beads. I was hoping she would share where I would order them online, again a very abrupt answer. You would have better luck and customer service at Michaels.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808fb7339034b229:0x60be616f7eeec9fa< /Gmap_id>< name>

<review>I have been visiting this store on and off for over 10 years and the woman manager (always thought she was the owner) has never been friendly. She can be helpful, but like many of the other reviewers, each time I'm there, I'm reminded that she is "not nice". Too bad. I had always suspected the prices were high and the other reviews certainly confirm that. I'll continue to go because it's fun to look at all the beads and it's near my home but I always feel kind of robbed and dirty when I leave knowing that I affirmed her attitude and approach by giving her more of my business when she did little to earn it.</review>< pictures>

<review>Terrific store! Amazingly varied items, and the owner (or manager) Kathleen is terrific! The go-to shop for beads, an earring or pin back, jewelry, mini-netsukes, actual wooden (modern)  netsukes and inro (complete with ojime), and other amazing items.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I wanted to support this store instead of checking out Joannes or going online but the sale person made it impossible. She was extremely rude, dismissive, and not helpful. I ended up just walking out - not a business worth supporting.< /text>

The gentleman, I can only assume to be the owner, was very courteous. He saw my wife and I waiting outside and provided us free water bottles. He also let us go inside while we wait for our car which thankfully felt air conditioned (not sure if it was though, but felt really nice and cool inside).

Service was amazing too! We were in and out within 20 minutes, and that's with waiting for another car ahead of us. I know where I'm coming and recommending from now on.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1592411322513, 'text': 'Thanks Will  we are glad we made ur smog check experience easy and convenient and feels good to know that after 15 yrs ur satisfied with economy test.

It was okay to leave work early years they couldn't the cater to you at the customer Indigo out of the way to make sure that the customer is satisfied with whatever parts or whatever they may need I would highly recommend going there to get whatever they need done respectfully Rudy J Tapia</review>

<review>Best experience so far in getting a smog check for my car!  Was helped out by Jesus who provided very friendly, honest service and in my case I think the actual smog check took only a few minutes, probably spent more time talking than the actual test. The place lived up to it's name in being economical. Highly recommended, will definitely come back!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Javier was a 10/10 employee. He was very helpful and friendly and helped solve my problem and helped other customers at the same time without any of us feeling like our time was wasted. He is an expert at time management and multitasking and a pleasure to do business with!<//Text>

Instead they will try to sell you overpriced items and make it sound like they are giving you a “deal”. I went to the store last Saturday and talked to the salesperson (Javier). I wanted a wireless device to connect my macbook pro. I also wanted to upgrade my phone so I talked to him about that. He offered a screen, a phone case and a wireless charger and said he was giving me a “deal”. I was charged $300 dollars that day and wasnt given a receipt. I went back yesterday to get a receipt since nothing that I paid for was showing up on my Verizon bill. The receipt showed two charges of “set up and go” of $20 dollars (dont know what that was), a phone case for $35, a wireless charger for $40, a phone screen for $65 which was way overpriced and tax fees. The wireless device and phone were added to the plan but no payments made towards those devices from the $300 dollar charges. I wanted to exchange the phone for a smaller one, so I tried to return everything except the devices. Javier would not refund the phone case I returned or explain the extra charges from the day before. Instead I was given the “runaround” he kept repeating he had helped me and given me a “deal” and he was getting in trouble for all this “help”. The fact is he did not give me a receipt or explain the charges the day before, it was unclear that I wasnt making any payments toward the Verizon bill. Instead I was sold items way overpriced, spent hours going there waiting in line to just be given the runaround when trying to get a refund the next day. The store policy should be a refund if the item is returned within 14 days. Also, there should be a receipt given the same day (if not printed it should be emailed). And there needs to be a clear understanding of charges up front. Too many irregularities in this experience, I would not recommend going there.< /review><date>1599548758240< /date>< Response>

Javier was very kind and patient helping me set up my phone. He had to do a lot of multitasking as several people kept showing up because their phones had no service due to an accident in Marina. He was very gracious going outside to explain what happened. Then he had to help me finish up with my new phone. He deserves a raise.< /text>

<Review>Wow Terrible customer service! I’ve never left a negative review about any place before. When  I tried coming in to the store to switch phone service from at&t I was told that with 1 hr. and 45 minutes until they close he was unwilling to help my family and me. I understand COVID restrictions and having to wait in line but there was only one other family in front of us. Thank you for the easy decision to go with another carrier.< /Review>< date>

<Review>Retail store wanted to charge half as much as the phone in "additional fees"  and lied to my gf and her mom about swapping in a phone that is purchased directly. Wouldn't stop trying to scam them when I explained that this isn't a new process to me and that I knew they were lying.< /Review>< pics>

Not helpful. Interesting that this location has poor data signal and then they try to up sell hotspots which don’t actually help with data signal or amplifiers that can’t be used in a mobile way. Careful with retailers, they will discreetly tack charges on to your phone bill that are hard to remove. Go to the official store if you’re a Verizon Customer since it’s already ripoff prices.</Review>

<Review>My daughter broke my phone at night and another store location was closed even when their hours said they were open.  Went to this location to try to get a new phone before the end of the day and the staff was amazing!  Super helpful and very personable.  I was helped by Mirhadi and he got me set up with a new phone and accessories at the end of the day so I could go home with a working phone :)  Great customer service and would recommend to others!< /Review></record>

The people mentioned below are still cool afaik....that being said.

This store claims they are just an affiliate and not full on store. They cannot do things like transfer lines according to their staff. So basically you're better off going to Costco or best buy where the deals are better.

Great staff. Super helpful! I didn't buy anything but had a TON of fun sitting at the round table waiting for my buddy to upgrade his phone. Everything went perfect.</text>

<text>Thanks to the service I received this will be my last phone purchased at a Verizon store.  The experience took over 1.5 hours, left the phone and info with him, 2.5 hours later I received a call that the phone was ready.  Then I had to wait for him to finish it which took over another hour.  My "free" accessories - he said he could not give me a price on until he rung them up.  That cost me $180 and I didn't receive a case that even fit my phone.  I went back to the store and he threatened to charge me even more if I returned them.  Not happy.  Extremely Mad. This is such a shame since it would be good to have a reputable dealer here in Marina but this event has shown otherwise.<//text>< Pics>

This was my first time visiting this store. I was having a problem with my phone. My iCloud wasn’t backing up. One of the employees I think her name was Diana. She took the time to fix and explain my problem even when they were busy. I will come again to this store.<//text>

I'm doing 3 stars because I give the carrier on my route 1 star for Lying that my package was undeliverable "because of a dog", we have no gate and No Dog! But I give the worker in the office 5 stars for caring about the matter, and following up to make sure my package came the following day.<//Review>

The employees will steal your mail if they think it’s a check. I have informed delivery which shows the images of mail pieces scheduled to be placed in my PO Box. For the last few years, mine and my families state tax refund checks were never delivered in the box! I’ve opened a missing mail claim online but it does no good.< /text>

As a struggling single mom, I went to park at the empty post office parking lot because their was no parking anywhere, with all my kids. After i got all my kids out of myvehicle,  a post office attendant man rebuked me publickly for parking in their half empty parking lot. He couldnt even over look for the sake of my children... And the fact that it was empty. I got up and left with my kids, was trying to go to the store next door. What happened to the days when men got up and gave their chairs to pregnant moms. And men opened doors fchairs up elderly. And moms with kids were treated with half decency..
Hope he feels like a complete gentlemen  and a big man...< /review>

< Review>
Dumbest people run this place.... I have told them a thousand times to leave my packages on my doorstep. They refuse. I have asked to sign a waiver or a form releasing liability and I get a run around every time. I sleep during the day and work later at night. I'm not awake to receive the packages. I trust my neighbors. I get packing slips on Friday stating to come in the next day when they are CLOSED. They TELL YOU to come in when they are CLOSED. UNACCEPTABLE!!! I have driven there with it being a holiday/closed COUNTLESS times. I hate this post office. I wish I didn't live near it sometimes. Received my packing slip on Friday and it says come in today 2/13 Saturday at 9am. I arrived and promptly banged on the doors and yelled and the people I could hear walking around. No response. I hope someone important reads this cause this post office needs to clean up their act and wipe those smug looks off their faces everytime I tell them to leave my darn packages on the doorstep!!! Tired of fighting these people!!!</Review>

<response>None<//response><Review>Genuinely the WORST post office I've ever delt with, after messing up the delivery of my package they told me it was delivered, then it wasn't delivered, then they COULDN'T deliver, then it was my final notice of delivery, then that they never had it (they can't even figure out what they're doing). After calling them repeatedly DURING business hours to be told they weren't open, when I finally got through I was told they don't have my package, they don't know where they sent it and rudely hung up on me...if I could give it negitive stars I would.< /Review>< user_id>

<text>Ridiculous, postal service...I have a regular gal Felicia, wonderful however if she has a replacement they are NOT REQUIRED TO CHECK AND SEE IF THERE IS OUTGOING MAIL IF YOU ARE NOT RECIEVING MAIL ...what the hell do they do then..this is not the first time that this happened ...this is outragous and beyond stupidity on the USPS..we have bills to take care of.(and wish not to do certain ones online).and for those of us who like to keep the USPS going and paying the crazy price of stamps, pick up outgoing mail...i spoke with Erickson over at Lodi PO..i asked him to send out someone to pick up my outgoing mail...so now someone who probably is already doing their job , now has to do someone elses because the incapable people at LPO, can't look 4ft over to the right of their pathway to ck for outgoing mail..
Lodi has some lazy substitute carriers...< /text></record></dataset><record>

One of the Worst postal places. Phone is always busy and staff not very helpful. Packages sometimes lost or delivered to other addresses. I had a package to be delivered yesterday 6/29 according to tracking and today is 6/30, it shows package is out for delivery since 6/29 but nothing. I am at work and constantly trying their phone number but it comes up busy. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
8/26/19 another package out for delivery and was not delivered. Reason for not delivering "Animal interference" i don't even have a dog, not even a bird 😁. They have been delivering for years and still don't know if i have a Animal or not? My neighbor has a dog but fence between our property is 6 foot high and their dog has no way of interfering in my mail delivery 🤦‍♂️.  Package delivered 8/27.<//Text>

Extremely disappointed with service of a person named JEFFEREY M. WALLORY. I had an appointment today at 1.00 pm with their Passport service to apply for my kids aged 7,5 &1. No body opened the door till 1.07 pm until I asked  the front desk to call the person in charge for passport applications. And then JEFFEREY M WALLORY showed up without any appologies for the delay. I had all 3 application forms ready to go, just needed him to take passport photos of my kids. He was moving too slow, ignoring our concern of other timebound commitments, talking to other staff members for vague reasons. Finally he took their pictures, printed those and started clipping them to the application forms . Just then I noticed that he took horrible pictures ( for $15 each), my 5 year old son’s picture looks like if he has a deformed face. We asked him if that is the picture he really thinks is suitable for my child to carry on his passport for next 5 years, his blunt reply was YES!
Can somebody ask this BIG SLOW MOVING CREATURE ... the how hard is it to make another click on his camera?
He was disgustingly rude!
My concern is that how am I going to explain this to my cute child that Why his passport picture shows a deformed face. And an INCOMPETENT person ended up working with a government run department, ‘ cause he assumes that all of the people at service are superheroes ☹️<//review>

We are waiting for some very sensitive mail and with them messing up and always putting our mail into someone else’s slot, who knows if we will ever get it. I have also called them and the people I talk to don’t seem to know anything. Horrible service.

<Review>They not only said they delivered my package but they do not know which apartment number. The supervisor Makaun -I have left 4 messages and still no call back. No concern as to where my package is.  Another supervisor took a message and still no resolution. Horrible customer service or knowledge of standard postal delivery. If it is an insufficient address it should go back to the sender not shoved into a random mailbox in an apartment complex.<//Review>< response>

<review>Let’s be honest when you are out of state you are always afraid to try somewhere different especially if you have  a favorite back at home. Trust us you will not be disappointed when you eat here!!! The best Mexican restaurant outside of our hometown favorite on the East Coast!!!<//review><rating>5</rating><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>102827951438385859697< /user_id>< resp>

Well guess I have a new favorite restaurant in Napa.  Carnitas were delicious, nice char to outside but didn't take any of the tenderness away.  Excellent corn tortillas along with rice and refrieds.  Service and drinks again excellent.  Highly recommend< /text>

Plus, the food made me sick all the week, I had take an antibiotics for the infection in the stomach. This restaurant have only one bathroom for gender and most of the time the line to enter is very long and besides are dirty. I will not be back ever. Before was a good restaurant but it looks like not anymore.<//Text>< rating>

<Review>Was glad that they had ample outdoor seating available. They're pet friendly and are located at a great spot in downtown Napa.

The service was okay, although food was delivered lightning fast probably because the food wasn't particularly delicious. The star of the show was the margarita we ordered. But let's be real, can you really go wrong with a margarita at a Mexican restaurant?

P.S. Don't order the Diablo Shrimp unless it's for a spicy food challenge.< /Review><Response>None</Response><UserId.>110921594482445873868< /UserId.><Date>1615153210707</Date>< Pictures>

Pretty terrible, everything is very wet, salty and OVERPRICED for what it is. Food came out rather fast, then we waited 20 minutes for someone to come to our table to get the check. Outdoor seating was nice but they didn't even bother to turn on the outdoor heaters when it's 5:15 (so already dark outside) and 60°, other nearby restaurants had THEIR hearers on, very cheap of them if you ask me. In the end we got 1 appetizers and 2 entrees which came out to about $50.<//Review>

The carnitas quesadilla I had was most excellent. I asked for a hot salsa & was treated to a delicious well blended thick masterpiece. The only thing that could have been better were the chips. They weren't horrible. But I've had better there.< /Text>

<Review>Everything was pretty good, the burrito I ordered had more beans than steak but it was still good. The thing that really saved this score was the deep fried ice cream. It was so good that if I didnt get full on beans I would have had a second ice cream.<//Review>< Pictures>

We dined here before a show at the Uptown. We set at the bar and had the combo fajitas. Everything including our drinks was excellent.< /text>

<Review>We asked them to leave the sour cream off the taquitos, and to substitute my rice with extra refried beans. They got the order right. They were generous with the guacamole, and it was mostly avocado with about 2 chunks of tomatoes and a bit of minced onions. I ordered the Don Perico Omelet, and again they were generous with the avocado. My only complaint is that the refried beans tasted canned to us, especially since last night we had great refried  beans at a different restaurant. All in all, though, we’d return here.< /Review><time>1532668523881</time></record>

We've been coming here for over 8 years when were in the area for lunch, and it never disappoints. I always get the Enchiladas Suizas and your order comes fast and hot! If you only got 30 minutes for lunch, you can sit down eat and be on your way no matter how busy they are... and as far as chips and salsa go, they are some of the best tasting that I have had.< /Review>

<Text>Came across this place a little late in the evening since most other restaurants were closed. Don Perico is in a nice location downtown. Good decor with optional outside seating. A little lax on the cleaning under our table, but the restaurant overall appeared clean. Ordered shrimp ceviche to start: would not recommend. It tasted like the shrimp was pre-cooked and then mixed into some pico with lime and avocado, as opposed to being marinated in a lime juice as a true ceviche should be. Could definitely taste the difference. I ate Enchiladas California and my husband had a Wet Steak Burrito. Not bad at all. 3 stars for the ceviche and our service. We were forgotten about for around 15 min after being seated; the gentleman who brought out the chips and salsa came and checked on twice before our waiter even came by,  then he took our drink orders AFTER we finally ordered food?!?! And no, the restaurant was not busy.  We don't have to return here.</Text></record>

<Review>Visiting from Texas, my mother took me and my husband to lunch here. I was hesitant because I really don't like restaurant food. However, I have to admit that this is one of the best meals I've had in a restaurant in years. The food was excellent, nice portions, friendly and excellent service in a lovely atmosphere. The prices were very modest. I would definitely eat here again and recommend eating here to friends and family.< /Review></record></dataset><record>
<review>We went there on Black Friday for lunch.  Food was alright (some dishes were quite salty but manageable) and server gave nice suggestions.  But the overall service was really sluggish.
Server barely attended us.  We were waiting for 20+ minutes till server was introduced and had to ask for the check to the host after no sight of server for a long duration.  We didn't even consider ordering desserts or any special drinks because of such slow service.
I know it must be a busy day but this isn't acceptable.<//review><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

The food is brilliant. I have just one suggestion, the food proportions are too enormous. Sometimes giving just the right amount and eating in the right manner can make meals wonderful for the customer. BTW, good job guys and gals.< /text>

<Review>Delicious! I had been craving Mexican food and this definitely hit the spot. I had the enchiladas verdes and they were so good. Came with rice and beans as well. They have your typical selection of Mexican food like tacos, burritos, and more.

We sat outside which was a bit hot, but no complaints here, they can’t control the weather!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80850667b63235bd:0x797cbd582abf313b<//gmap_id>< name>

This place is great. I had the camerones rancheros and it was wonderful. We were walking the river front with our dog and they we're flexible and allowed us to sit on the patio, with our dog, and enjoy dinner. We will be back.</review>

Carnitas tacos was so tender and juicy full of flavor. Unfortunately the experience wasn’t completely pleasant, (to no fault of the establishment) other patrons had their kids running wild until the waiter came over and asked them to settle the kids down. Overall the food is pretty decent.<//review>

Relaxed, traditional atmosphere. Their drinks are one of a kind, and would absolutely recommend the Coronarita to all my friends and family. Top- Notch experience here. Also nestled in downtown surrounded by bars that always hold events weekend nights.</text>< pics>

Used to be absolutely fantastic. I feel like they aren't as quick to serve, or affordable as they once were. Portions seem to be smaller these days also. Still tastes good, and will be going back on occasion, just isn't my go to like it used to be.</text>

Went for lunch with friends.  Service was quick and personable.  Their lunchtime specials, at reduced prices, runs until 2PM.  Food was fresh and good tasting, and ample serving sizes.  Prices were moderate and there was plenty of parking.  The restaurant is in a vibrant area of beautiful Napa.<//text>

Good Mexican food joint in downtown Napa.  It's situated at lavish side of Napa river. Has great food options. We tried their quesadillas, chimichanga and taco sizzler. We loved it. They provide good veg substitute also upon request.</Text>

I appreciated they modified my dish to remove dairy, and the food came relatively quickly, however it was pretty basic. Better than a fast food Mexican place but not nearly as good as a smaller authentic place. The large room also lacked character.</Text>

Waiters/waitresses were great. Food was mediocre; tasted okay. Drinks were not the best. Restaurant looked clean and presentable BUT gets easily stuffy with the fajita grills coming out. Stuffy, smoggy, and tight seating.</review>

Hubby had Carne Asada Enchiladas and I had the Chicken Flautas - very tasty and just the right amount of spice. The atmosphere was upbeat, it was clean & the staff was friendly. We were at a table of 10 and we were well taken care of. Will definitely be be visiting here again!< /Review>< Pictures>

It was just an average experience. Staff wasn't great and food was ok. Would probably try it one more time to see if it was a unique experience. The atmosphere was nice though.< /review>

We were just walking by and decided to go in for a margarita and glad we did. It happen to be happy hour when we got there and the margarita were excellent. We ordered the taquitos and homemade guacamole which were both very good.. but their green salsa was awesome it had pieces of pork meat in it. Will back again for sure..</Text>

Was sad that they closed their doors because of the earthquake but when they opened up across the street in the new Plaza we had to go and it was just as good as ever and an even better atmosphere. In fact that's where I proposed and she said yes so thank you for for helping me start my family.<//Review>< pictures>

Really loved this place. The food was fresh and delicious. The service was not only friendly and efficient, but accomodating. They made me a drink that was not on the menu, and also made a take-out item for us that was not on the menu. We had dinner on the patio. The ambience and decor were so nice. The music was perfect...loud enough to hear and to make you relax and get into that South-of-the-Border mood, where your feet can't help but dance a little...ebut not so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation comfortably. Overall, a perfect way to spend a Napa evening! We will be back!</review>

Good service, but the food was not very good. Needless to say, i was dissappointed with my meal, grilled chicken burrito. My drink was good, pom margarita but super strong. Chips an salsa were good.<//review>

Went here for a quick bite. Food was your standard Mexican fare, but with lower prices than many other restaurants in downtown Napa.

I wish there service was more prompt though. For a table of two it took us almost an hour to get food.<//text>

My favorite, and very affordable, place to eat in Napa. They have excellent steak fajitas, wet burritos and fries ice cream!! They also have a children's menu with good options, that my infant can choose from, too. Great service and free chips and salsa. Their house margarita is delicious.< /review>

Very dated menu - tiny burritos with a side or rice and beans. Meat was seasoned alright, but only passable at best. Cheese enchilada was shockingly good however. Otherwise, not much of interest here at pretty inflated prices.<//Text>

My family and I luckily discovered this place while on a weekend getaway in Napa. Only a 20 minute wait on a Saturday night while other restaurants had closer to a 2 hour wait. The service was great and the food was excellent! Guacamole portions were very reasonable for the price and the shrimp is to die for. Best shrimp my mom said she has ever had! A must try when visiting Napa. Will definitely be back.<//text>

We are here our first day in Napa. The guy we had as a server was very polite and attentive. The food isn’t fantastic though. We had the Fajitas Mixtecas (shrimp, chicken and beef), they were okay but our vegetables were all still raw on the skillet when they brought it to us. It’s in a nice little enjoyable area with a decent beer selection.< /Text>

I won't lie: nice arrangement but too American for a Mexican restaurant, even the taste, nothing to do with Mexican food. Tried some flautas, tortilla soup and kids crunchy taco... also some horchata and agua de jamaica... not at all, totally disappointed... besides, while waiting, lot of smoke coming from the fajitas served to other tables, made the whole room cloudy... we were in an urge to leave. Service people were all nice, but food and ambience totally disappointing...<//Text>

The bartender was super friendly and shared tastings of drinks I had never heard of. Good suggestions on food and friendly conversation.  The food was excellent, not you run of the mill Mexican fare.< /review>

For me it's all about the Shrimp Fajitas!! Always! Fresh, Hot, Sizzling platter of awesomeness! No extra oil, just the Shrimp, Bell peppers and onions. I prefer the black beans on the side.< /text>

I am 100% Mexican so I am picky about my Mexican food. I was iffy about this place because I'm visiting from out of town and I am glad I decide to come here! Great service, great food (I got the Carnitas plate and it was delicious, reminded me of home) Great decor! I LOVE this place and I would definitely recommend it</text>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>One of the better working man's Mexican food places. It ain't elevated, it ain't boughie, a bit better than Chevy's as far as atmosphere, but the food and drinks are miles better. Personal favorites are chili verde, cocktail de Cameron, and Paloma. Free chips and salsa for days.

Full bar with a few TV's, but not a sports bar at all. Service is good, but can be a little frantic when there at capacity. Located smack dab in the middle of downtown napa, good place to pregame without breaking the bank.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

My favorite local mexican restaurant. They lose a strar because while they advertise in some of the airline miles program, I repeatedly have to send in receipts to be credited for my dining. It doesn't happen to me with any of the other restaurants so I can't help but think they're playing dirty in that regard.  Great food though.<//text>

Good service.  Gave it 3 because the food is just OK. Great chips, salsa, and cocktails though.</text>

<Text>Chips and salsa were very bland. Salsa was watery and guacamole needed salt or something. We didn't have high expectations for the main dishes and they ended up being much better. My husband liked the Chile Verde enchiladas a lot. I ordered the vegetarian burrito which could have used more beans to balance the amount of rice inside but the sauce on top was good. Portion sizes are grande!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80850667b63235bd:0x797cbd582abf313b</GmapID></record>

The best place for Mexican food in Napa. I'd recommend the fajitas, but all of the food I've tried here has been great.</review>

<text>It was my very first time going here and I had the steak fajitas. but before we had fajitas I ordered the spicy bean dip and the chicken flautas. I'm not a fatty so I didn't eat all of it myself I was there with my fiance.Just want to clear that up before going on with my review. Bean dip was great because they added jalapenos and chorizo in their bean dip which was a nice change of pace because it gave it a little hardness to it and some chick. The chicken flautas were pretty good but not really they were basically deep fried taquitos and I really love flautas and I just was not a fan there was nothing to it they were they don't have very much taste at all. But then when we got to the fajitas that was bad boys were amazing. The steak Was Juicy the vegetables were crisp and fresh and the old sizzling pan was always fun growing up seeing and hearing and it just brings back memories. Overall, it was a great experience and the food was above average definitely but not the flautas. I wouldn't get those again but I would definitely order the bean dip and the fajitas again even though I won't because I'm going to try other things. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's in Napa for some good Mexican food and I really chill atmosphere. drinks wise I just had a Coke and some sparkling didn't try any beer or the margaritas next time I probably will and I didn't have any dessert but I don't think I would have dessert there just because there's Ben & Jerry's around the corner and some other good places in Napa. I hope this is helpful to anyone looking for good Mexican restaurants in Napa.</text>< pics>

<review>I left be Don P's! Not only great Margaritas, they do a really delicious green chili dip for nachos. We love the brunch on Sunday. Heck, you can have huevos rancheros all day long! The only reason u withheld a star is the parking can be tricky as they don't have their own lot. Ask for Guissepé at the bar- one of Napa's best bartenders.</review>< GmapID>

So good...sad they lost their orignal restaurant due to the Napa earthquake but the family came back in a Big way you'll really like Don Pericos. Also if you like to take your doggie along like i do they have a nice patio outside in the napa town plaza.< /review>

<review>They are very generous with their chips and salsa to start with. I highly recommend the sopitos, the sope itself it's soft in the inside and crispy on the outside, the beef topping is delicious.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80850667b63235bd:0x797cbd582abf313b</gmap_id></record>

Umm HELLO .. who isn't a local and doesn't like Don Perico's?  Been patroning this restaurant since before the earthquake.  When they had that beautiful mural and decor [I LOVE the chairs] in their old location.  new location is roomy, airy and well worth the wait.  This is our go to .. with the kids.  They love it here. We love it here.  With this visit, it was just me and the hubs.  Tried something different this time .. Taquitos .. almost like the flautas, except with corn tortillas instead of flour [duh, I know right?!?!].  Server is always super amazing, had him a couple different times.  Had a margarita here for the first time too.  It was a strawberry one.  Pretty darn good, considering I usually go for a Long Island or an Adios. <3<//text>

Ask for the camarones (shrimp) a la diabla but extra spicy. You will love it. To go with order a michelada or a cantarito. It's great!< /text>

< Review>
So far it's the best Mexican Food in town. I was here about a month ago when I was on vacation.  Good seasoning unlike other so called Mexican Restaurants that served you pre package tortillas chips. Here their tortilla chips are tasty and fresh along with the salsa. Had their chile verde delish.</Review>

Bad service and even worse food. Very bland and unappetizing quesadillas and fajita platter.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Courtesy waiters, water is refilled free of charge, nachos with spicy red sauce are put on the table for free and when paying, there's a candy. That's how customer experience goes! :) the food was delicious and rich! We had a wet burrito and an avocado salad. The burrito was quite spicy but very delicious!

(Original)
Zuvorkommende Kellner, Wasser wird kostenlos aufgefüllt, Nachos mit scharfer roter Sauce werden kostenlos auf den Tisch gestellt und beim Bezahlen gibt's ein Bonbon. So geht Kundenexperience! :) das Essen war super lecker und reichhaltig! Wir hatten einen wet burrito und einen Avocado Salat. Der Burrito war ziemlich scharf aber unheimlich lecker!</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very consistent with the Chinese Western food, ordered a Mexican steak. The steak is tender and delicious. The rice on the left is great with steak! There are vegetables and potatoes on the right, and there are roasted chesses underneath!
