< Review>
Doans did a wonderful job repairing my car back to its original condition. Safety was a concern of mine and the shop prepared for me an in depth repair estimate using all original parts. Very high end shop and worksmanship!< /Review>

<text>Doan’s is THE BEST body shop around!! When my car was rear ended and potentially had frame damage, they were the only ones who took the time to explain to us that that was a possibility. We went to multiple body shops for quotes and none of them compared to Doan’s. They did exceptional work for a great price and even corrected the sun damage on my hood for no extra charge. These guys are awesome, I wouldn’t trust my car anywhere else!!<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Trung and the team at Doan’s made the claim and repair process smooth and stress-free. The level of service and quality of repair they provided our family was exceptional. We were treated like family and Trung took great care in ensuring no detail was missed including the detail of the interior and exterior of our vehicle. It’s so good to see this family business continue to thrive!</Review>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>After a side swipe, I found myself shopping around for auto cosmetic services. This is the third place I went for a quote, and I chose Doan’s for several reasons. First and foremost, I really trusted them. After showing me other before/afters from similar customers, I saw the quality of work they’re capable of. They also worked with me to accommodate my car’s repairs prior to the start of the school semester. Not only was their quote competitive, but the work is perfect and I’m so thankful to have my car back a day earlier than promised! I highly recommend Doan’s as a trustworthy auto body shop!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIMhoI1Adr2I_D6CXEm1GzJjAB_6Pd_NuxfrSW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPswV2wooK4LOlKaXE021hwO-_ELAe_E1z_Keo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2CQNKPwMXAZNyc7Z3Wi-ArwzFn7O5aIGwOUl-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxIAfabCAkA_yoz3tsgHAtST0F5zdWEfQLaqqW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

Doans auto body is by far the best auto shop I’ve been to. A family owned shop, once you walk in, you immediately get treated with excellent service and courtesy. Waiting area had free drinks and coffee as well. Long story short, I had a minor fender bender in my garage and my grill was busted (needed replacing) and numerous scratches. Having a pricier car, I wanted top notch quality work at an affordable price. A friend of mine recommended Doans auto body so I made the short 30 min trek from Sacramento. Trung and Thanh really take pride in their work and it shows. My car looks just as it was brand new + a new grill that gave it an even sportier look =]. They saved me money as well and saved my bumper rather than replacing it buffing out and touching up a lot of the scratches. Oh and I got a free foam pressurized car wash too at the end which was definitely a surprise and added bonus!! Most other shops just takes your payment and hand you the key. I highly recommend anyone that needs automotive work done to bring their car here or give them a call.<//text>

These guys are great! They were responsive via Yelp. I needed the front license plate installed and they did it quickly. The guy who helped me (I didn’t get his name) was friendly and didn’t charge. I searched all over for help and these folx were awesome. I’ll be returning for any auto body and paint needs I may have in the future.</review>

<Text>BEST body shop in Yolo County!! If you really love your car like I do, I know you do not want to just take it to any shop. This is why I recommend this shop. I have taken my cars to other shops in Woodland and Davis area before and I was never satisfied with the work. This is why I decided to look around for a new shop after doing my research of 2 days I knew I had to call them right away. My SUV was hit during the storm we had a few weeks ago so my whole bumper had to be replace and other things had to be done that I had missed but Trung noticed so they really pay attention to the small details that we sometimes miss. The other best part about this shop is that they take AAA insurance! Also anytime I would call they would answer right away I never got an answering machine or had to leave a message that was another thing I really like about this shop.  Trung is the best he is so patient and explains everything so carefully he is awesome!!  I really recommend this shop.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x8084d1642907a92b:0xf6d3d903c9fba470<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

<Text>Gave them a call after i was rear ended on I-80. They took my car in and handled the insurance to get my estimate and car fixtures under way. Every time i would call they , without me asking, would give me a full rundown of what the status was of my car and insurance claim. Friendly and professional staff, which is not something you find in all body shops. 10/10 would recommend if you want exceptional car work and an easy experience<//Text><GmapID>0x8084d1642907a92b:0xf6d3d903c9fba470< /GmapID>< Date>

I know that I am getting amazing work done to my car when I bring it here. My front bumper needed to be replaced so I took it here because years ago I had work done on my car and afterwards I was very pleased. Not only was the pricing great but the work is amazing. I’m truly happy with how everything had turned out and even the little things that were done I wasn’t charged for. I got my car the next day so I didn’t have wait long for the work to be done. The paint job is also great and matches well. Doan is very welcoming and respectful. He knows what he’s doing and I highly recommend him.</text>

Went yesterday to get an estimate on my bumper that was hanging off and cleaning my headlights. I was greeted and helped immediately, and they let me know how they would fix it. The owners were very nice and professional and the waiting area was very clean and taken care of. I took my car the next morning on my break, they were nice enough to take me back to work, which was awesome. I will definitely be recommending them to everyone I know! It was a  great experience and they even washed my car! Very thankful I took it here!!! Thank you Doan's!!!< /Review>

<review>Trung did an amazing job on the headlight restoration. My first thought pulling up were they were brand new headlights. He sanded and buffed them all the way until they were perfect. Very professional as well. I fully recommend them and will use them in the future for all my auto body needs.<//review>< pictures>

I was recommended here from a local mechanic shop that claimed they are the best in town. Once I walked through their door was I blown away. Clean, updated and professional appearance. I was welcomed right away and with in 5 minutes I was being driven home by the owner. After a few hours I received a call saying my truck was done. They offered to pick me up and I was back on the road in no time. Thank you Doan’s for an incredible and fast service on my truck.<//Text>

<review>The Doan family is very trust worthy and honest. Over the years I have seen them go above and beyond for their customers. I called Thursday before closing time and was able to be scheduled for first thing Friday morning.

Trung offered to pick up my car from my work which made my morning a lot less stressful. Not to long later I received a text from him saying that my car was ready and he was on his way to drop it off to me at my work. I appreciate them taking the stress off my back of finding rides to and from there.

Can't complain about quick service along with free pickup and drop offs! Their prices are also great, I always refer people over to them.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

My beloved 2005 Volvo V50 was hit in TJ’s parking lot in Davis recently. The owner had Progressive insurance, which was great. After getting a quote, and a check on the spot, I asked a local mechanic friend who had the best auto body shop in Woodland, and he recommended Doan’s.  When I went there, they were friendly and knowledgeable, and even found more damage that the first shop had missed.  Doan’s contacted Progressive, who paid for the additional work, and they returned the car to me looking “as good as new”. If you love your car and need body work or paint, go here.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I had a great experience with Doan’s. Trung is  incredibly helpful, offering options and suggestions that consider structural versus strictly cosmetic fixes. The estimate was accurate and the lowest quote I received. The equipment and techniques are state of the art and the shop and offiice are clean and well organized. Can you tell a teacher I’m trying to get in on this paperService was fast and excellent and Trung even refinished the headlight lenses at no charge. I can’t say enough about the professionalism, helpfulness, and follow up provided by Doan’s Auto Body. I will definitely bring my car here for any future work.<//text>< Pictures>

<Date>1565276223092<//Date><review>Doan’s Auto Body Shop is sincerely committed to excellence. My expectations went above and beyond and Troung and his staff met all my expectations. My car was repaired quick and efficient and the pricing was unmatchable to all other competitors. Truong was hands on and even when he was busy working on other vehicles he gave his full attention of what my needs were and explained in detail what I needed to repair my car. My vehicle was even repaired before the expected date and made my life easier between my hectic schedule. I would definitely recommend Doan’s Auto Body Shop to anyone who needs to repair their vehicle. Thanks Doan’s Auto Body Shop, I will be coming back again if I ever need any body work done to my future vehicles!<//review>< user_id>

Finding a reputable named shop in Woodland really isn’t that difficult. Finding a reputable shop that actually does “quality” work is rather difficult. I visited a few in town and just didn’t get the feeling they wanted the job or trusted they were going to do the job correctly and not cut corners UNTIL I met with Trung at Doan’s Auto Body & Paint. He really went above and beyond my expectations. His communication was great giving me constant updates, honest feedback and recommendations during the entire process. He cut no corners and the finished product is the proof! My wife’s beloved 2013 Armada came out like new. Not to mention, he completed the job on time ensuring I wouldn’t have to be in my rental for an extended time. Thanks again Trung to you and your entire staff!</Review>

Excellent experience here at Doan’s. Came in last minute and Trung was able to take my car in immediately. My dealership wouldn’t replace my signal light with the part I ordered online but the guys at Doan’s completed the job within 30 minutes.</Text>

< review>
When I walked into Doan's Auto Body I was extremely impressed with their presentation and professionalism. Trung helped me with my estimate and within 30 mins I was in a rental car and had my claim opened. Doan's kept me informed throughout my repair process and followed up with me often. When I came to pick it up, my vehicle looked better than before my accident. They fixed some unrelated damage add did a nice detail on my car. I highly recommend them!!!<//review>

<text>If your in a hurry, don't be. It's social hour for a few employees who think they own the place.
One of the older women can be rather hostile at times. Unprofessional. I recommend talking with the owner if any of them give you a hard time. Personally, I prefer another gas station now.<//text>< pics>

Beware the night cashier is possibly attempting fraud. I was told there were issues running my card at the night window, the cashier indicated he would need me to tell him my pin to make my purchase. This was a big red flag to me. Will never go back to this place.<//Review>

Brought my family here on their first Bay Area visit, and we found this vineyard open last minute on their last day here. We didn’t know anything about it, but we’re amazed to find out that not only was their wine amazing but also the history of the winery with the founder George Cooper brought smiles to my parent’s faces since my father is retired Air Force! My family will be buying wine here from now on as it has a great personal connection with us. Corrie took care of all of our needs and more, so if you go ask for her and she will go above and beyond to make your experience amazing and unforgettable!</review>

< Review>
Such an amazing winery! Great people, service, wine, views and ambience! Cory, who I believe is one of the owners of the winery provides excellent service and truly makes her guest feel welcome. Cory isn’t the only employee who goes above and beyond, the entire staff is amazing.

This place is a must see!< /Review>

Always good wine, friendly helpful staff and a very pleasant environment.  Today was especially nice for an unfortunate reason.  Because of Covid, there were very widely spaced tables, most empty. So it was very quiet and peaceful.  Take advantage of it while it lasts.</Text>

<text>Beautiful setting for outdoor wine tasting. During covid-19 you have to keep your mask on while walking around or when a server is at your table, otherwise you are able to keep it off while you enjoy your tasting experience.< /text><resp>None<//resp>< time>

We are members here and love coming up for a free tasting flight.  It feels like you've left the city hundreds of miles behind and you're out in the country, peaceful and quiet. In non-covid times we have put our kids on a trail ride with their horses while we enjoyed the tasting room. For now, the patio is open for tastings and on Sundays, lunch or nibbles, with masks and distancing.   I enjoy their two vineyard red blends. All the wines have names related to the aviation industry.< /text>

Pleasant afternoon in a most genial and  accommodating environment sampling home produced wines. No pretence, the wines are good quality and very easy on the palate. Cheese, cured meat and varieties of crackers available to accompany the wine.</Text>

<Date>1597013666783< /Date><review>Came without a reservation but the hostess still sat us. However the server seemed upset we had came without a reservation and ignored us for 15 minutes. People that came after us were seated and served while we remained ignored. Only when when we started to leave did the hostess ask if we had been served and offered to serve us now,  to which we said no and left. Rude and slow customer service. Would be willing to give a second chance, if only for the view, if service improves.</review>< rating>

Sweet winery to treat yourself with after a hike through Stevens Creek County Park or Fremont Older Preserve. Tastings are pretty standard in pricing for the area, but I have consistently had a variety of excellent wines, I even enjoyed one of the whites, a rarity to say the least.<//Text>

< Review>
We visited during one of the musical events on a Sunday afternoon, and the experience was thoroughly delightful! Great location, fantastic views,  excellent wines for tasting!

A word of warning though - bring your own picnic, this place sells some nibbles, but you’ll be better off with your own.< /Review>

Came by this winery on the last weekend of the passport month. Finding the place is certainly a bit of a trek as it is pretty far up I to the hills. But you pass many spectacular houses along the way and there are some great views once you get there.

The woman that helped us out was very friendly and knowledgeable about the wines. Unfortunately none of them really spoke to us. A couple of them tasted decent but had an earthy smell that was a bit off-putting.

They also have horse back riding here as the stables were there before the winery.</Text>

This place is unique - it's a working horse ranch and winery, and in the same family since the 1800's. Inside the Old Fruit Shed Tasting Room you can see lots of old documents and pictures on the wall from the old days, and they have some unique gift shop items, too. Fun place to visit - you can taste wine then watch the horses in the arena getting their workout. (they also rent horses here)</Text>

The person who served the wine was able to choose good wines for my taste easily. She was also knowledgeable. But if I didn't ask a question she was not about to give me information and I was the only person in the winery. Therefore I debated about giving it 3 stars.<//Review>< Pictures>

The office told us there would be available horses for us two hours later when we arrived. We wait outside two hours and see another group comes. The office just said the group is with the same party as previous group and refuse us. Has really bad attitude and no respect to our time.< /Text>

<Text>Orders my meal on grub hubs. Spend $13. Food ready in 8:05pm - 8:15pm. Got there 8:10pm.
No one at front counter. 2 employees annoyed me and proceed help the tables. I wait 30 minutes. I sat on the chair and play game on my phone. So Thank you! Not coming here again. So keep the $13.<//Text><username>Randy Or</username><Date>1618976348656< /Date><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

Honestly, the food is ok, nothing is outstanding compared to the restaurants in this complex. The steam yellow chicken tastes just fine but it’s cool, I think if it’s served hot it will be better. Salted and pepper fried tofu is too much breaded, crunchy but I just personally don’t like a thick flour cover for any fried food. Seafood fried rice is good with many different toppings. Pork Green bean is too much greasy. Good service, friendly staffs.</text>

The food was good. Not the best, but totally enjoyable. Questionable interior design choices, with decorations being a mix of traditional and simplified Chinese, making me doubt whether or not it was a Hong Kong style cafe when I entered. However, the space looks very modern and clean. Your bill must be at least $30 for them to accept a credit card as payment.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>A very good alternative to top cafe.  Very clean and fast services.  Good are great too.  Not very crowded  regardless weekdays or weekend.  They have a play ground for children near the front door.  If u sit near would be a nice place to let your bear kiddos run free inside the play ground.< /Review>< Pics>

The food was great. Probably too good. My wife wants me to stop by Local Cafe on my way home to pick up some foodie goodness for HER! The staff is great! My son is autistic and was having a slight issue with the wind, (outside seating) and the owner offered to move us to a less exposed table. Highly recommended for the whole family.</Text>

Very nice little restaurant with high ceiling, very spacious. They have a combo menu which is only $29.99 and you can order 3 dishes, it also come with soup in cute little cups.
Everything was tasty. It would be nice if the waiter can smile more tho :)< /Text>

Beef chow fun is grease and poor taste. The worst is clay pot rice.I think they just save time by putting the steam rice in the pot instead cooking in the clay pot. There is no burnt rice layer in bottom. The chicken meat was also cooked outside. The milk tea is average. The curry beef tone over spaghetti is OK.

Go back second time to try different dishes. Hainan chicken is plain.  The pickles is extremely salty. The ginger source has no ginger favor.  The hot lemon tea is disappointed, they just add one slice of lemon into regular tea.  Milk tea is OK. No change on rating<//text>

This is a 2nd location from the main Cupertino branch. The menu and the food quality is the same. The curry / cream sauce is a little bland -- we ordered the pork chip friend rice and meat sauce spaghetti which is better. The swiss sauce wings is really more like soy sauce wings. This place is a lot bigger than the Cupertino location and I like the fact that they have a kids corner, that's a nice touch.</Review>

This area needs an authentic Hong Kong cafe. Our family gave it a try to see how this place stacks up to the food we ate in Hong Kong. The presentation and taste is close but not quite there. Got the pan fried noodle with satay beef, hoinan chicken rice, and a spam noodle soup. The chicken clay pot takes a while so we didn't get that.
The restaurant operation needs some work to be more efficient. One customer next to us didn't get their food after over 30 mins and they left. The dish washer person needs training because the dishes we got were mostly dirty.
This place has potential once they work out the issues.<//Review>< Rating>

New HK style Cafe in Fremont. Nice big restaurant. It is currently in soft opening till 2/3 and accept only cash for now, the nice thing is you get a 12% off till then. I really like the food. We got a chicken steak with mushroom sauce and the rice noodle rolls with XO and peanut sauce. I would've taken pics of the food but the family was hungry and dug right in. In the wait area they had a little section set aside for the kids to play which is a nice addition. Service was also pretty good, but as you can see from the photos not many people there.< /Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Raw chicken, Raw pork, Raw onion. 3 times in one month. They are just giving up.

2 weeks ago, ordered their baked pork and chickens over rice.
Pork is raw and has room temp inside
Chicken is deep fried but still super raw inside
They gave me another one, but I lost my appetite...

Today I ordered chicken and pork teriyaki. Pork is grilled with no favor and seasoning. Chicken is very raw inside with pink color. The onion is raw as well. Can't believe they cannot even cook onion.....

Sent the dish back, and they give me another one.

Guess what? They deep fried the pork and it's very dry  inside with no seasoning...

They also deep fried the chicken a little bit longer, but it's still raw inside. Didn't want to send the dish back because it's just pointless now.</Text><name>Name N/A</name>< userid>

Great Hong Kong style cuisine at affordable prices. Can’t go wrong with their rice plates or the family style menu with 3 entrees for under $30.< /text>

<Date>1565153034737<//Date><review>Good food at reasonable prices and quick service. There’s a large selection to choose from. Some of the beef could use more flavor but a little soy Sauce and chili oil did the trick. Nice large spaces for bigger groups to dine together. Even have a kids play area!  Really enjoyed the clay pot dishes. Will go again.
Next time will get some pics to post!</review>< username>

<review>For the price and quality, I would definitely recommend it. You get a decent plate for 10 bucks.
Also, they serve breakfast on Saturday and Sunday! Actually worth one more star!

After visiting it for 4th time, I want to reduce two star as the food was not fresh this time. I ordered same dishes but this time it is clearly that they were made beforehand and recooked and served. Maybe due to a Wednesday and before 6pm. So advice is: weekends are better and after 7pm is better.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This restaurant has a big menu with lots of selections, and it seems they do the more Chinese-style dishes better than their HK-bistro-style dishes (which is fitting to their Chinese name "Cha-Chan-Teng" 茶餐廳).

Although lacking "smoothness" the hot milk tea is still acceptable, but I wouldn't order the cold one again.

The Seafood Fried Rice with XO Sauce was good, with variety of seafood--even fish!--and sufficient "wok aroma" 鑊氣, but as with the dish from any other places, one would want bigger pieces of seafood and more xo sauce.

The two Baked Rice--Baked Pork Chop and Portuguese Chicken--both lacked flavor in The sauce, left my friends and I a lot more to desire (we only finished half of each).

Service is what one gets in a typical Chinese restaurant, so you wouldn't expect much, but the restaurant itself is spacious and open, and when my friends and I stayed for a long lunch (reunion), we didn't feel pressured to leave.</Text>

<Time>1555273662731< /Time><rating>1< /rating><Review>This place was an absolute disappointment. My family was attracted to Local Cafe from its interior decoration. It loooked neat and clean, and there was a wide variety of food at reasonable prices (not really, after I tried). Once we entered, no one was there to serve the table! We kept waiting for around 3 min till we were assign a table. Furniture was ok except all those weird signs on the wall. Come on, you think it is a tea cafe just because you put a bunch of signs relatiNG TO HK? Took us forever to wait for a waiter/waitress to take our order. My family ordered a sizzling plate with black pepper sauce with a combination of chicken and ham, another sizzling plate with cream sauce, and a HN chicken rice plate. Each one ordered an iced lemon tea. Everyone was disappointed about the food, especially the fact they were all very bland and unseasoned. Sizzling plate was not at all sizzling, the food was cooked outside. The sauce was horrible, it did not enhance the flavor or the food. HN chicken came. Chicken was awful. It came with a side: peanuts, but they were way too salty. There was a giant lump of salt in there. How is that possible, that’s disgusting. The meat was not fresh, it was either too rough or too mushy. Iced lemon tea should just be called “brown water” because there was NO LEMON FLAVOR! Overall, food and service sucked, so I would not recommend this place unless you enjoy eating dishes that taste like nothing.

Rating:
Interior: 3/5 not bad
Service: 1/5 no service
Food: 1/5 terrible
Overall: 1/5 do not recommend
Also there were no images of their dishes on their menu. Kind of suspicious.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc7b387038e67:0x5e5e37edb509e3ef< /Gmap_id></record>

<time>1581460688433</time><Rate>5</Rate><review>(Translated by Google) A friend came for a meal. I didn't find that this shop had a very careful layout. It was a tea restaurant. I just ordered a few dishes. The price was very close to the people. Ninety percent did not exceed ten yuan. It was unexpected to see a large pot full of food. What moved me even more was that there are souls in these ordinary dishes. I ca n’t stop chopsticks when I ca n’t eat enough. I can feel the chef ’s intention I thought the chef should be a little old. I never thought that the owner of this restaurant was a chef. He hadn't reached the age of thirty. Although he hadn't met, he must be a gourmet. . .

朋友约来吃饭，以前竟然没发现有这家店😛布置很用心，是家茶餐厅，随便点了几个菜，价格非常非常亲民，百分之九十都没超过十元，不过上菜时看到满满的一大盆倒是出乎意料，更让我这个吃货感动到的是，就这些平常的菜里都有灵魂，我吃到实在吃不下才停筷，能感受厨师的用心，本来以为厨师该有点年纪了，未曾想到这家店的老板就是厨师，三十岁都没到，虽未谋面，但一定是个爱美食的人。。。<//review>< pictures>

三餸一湯：餸夠大碟，味道適中，不偏鹹味精唔算多，湯的份量很少家，只有半杯，可能就快賣晒不過冇夾硬加水，唔扣分！上次比三粒星今次比多粒總共四粒。餸食淨2/3，因為已飽，侍應生好貼心，打包時仲問白飯要唔要帶走，最後還有鮮橙贈送。< /Review>< userid>

I stopped going to this cricket store because the staff there had a lot of attitude and made it very difficult but recently I gave this store another shot today. I had to pay my mother’s phone bill and the girls, Tania and Jhovana, were  extremely helpful and nice in general. Best service from all the cricket stores I’ve gone to. Old staff is not there anymore and the new employees seems more properly trained and have more experience than the employees during my previous visit. Strongly recommend coming to this Cricket!< /text>

Decided to give this cricket store a shot. Employees here go beyond than what is expected. I had a terrible experience in a previous store I had visited and Tania here in this store was wonderful to explain to me all the promotions they had. Brought two Verizon lines to Cricket got 2 Lg stylo 6 and she had no problem in giving me a discount. Tania was amazing in general I give her 5 stars only reason my review has 4 stars is because I don’t understand why their activation fees are so high.</Text>

To your supervisor or manager;
Please hire staff with knowledge and professionals.
I am not satisfied with the service she provided me been the second time I came here to fix the problem.

I hope you read it and explain for your staff to not wast people time and learn before you serve people.

Thank you< /review>

This particular store is the worst at Creekside I went in there just to look around and the new girl had me by a cover for my phone for my Samsung and when I got home to change it it was the wrong one then because I opened it it was non-returnable so she got me for a good $30 so no I don't think this is a good store for anybody rip off</Review>

(Translated by Google) Thank you Tania you are very friendly and excellent customer service. She explained in detail the promotions and what was best for me in prices and services. I left the store super happy for the service of this girl, I will not go to another store because there is no service like hers. I saw when I went to the store that he treated all his customers very well and in the same way, they all left very happy. Once again, thank you very much, go with Tania.

I absolutely love this facility! I had a great time working there and have become passionate about working with special needs clients. The facility offers so many great learning opportunities to those with developmental disabilities and even has a few group homes for those who require nursing care or care givers. Since I was a nurse there, I didn't get to spend much time in the main facility, but every time I was there I was greeted with the most heart warming smiles from the different people who attend the programs there. Great people and great facility.<//review>

<review>Absolutely HORRIBLE place to work at!!!!! They worked me like a slave & did NOT give me minimum wage!!!!!! They only gave me well five cents per item that I finished.  The administrator illegally had her daughter working as an internship and she's only 16 and by their own rules you have to be 18 or over to be in that place I gave the girl a hug she freaked out because I'm autistic and they fired me and that's the best thing that could've happened because now I'm in a much better Day Program that DOES pay minimum wage.  I would not recommend new horizons to anybody ever on top of the bad horrible working conditions they are slave drivers and they yell and scream at people I am so glad happy and more peaceful since I have left a horrible horrible horrible place I cannot believe they are still open for business they should be shut down how does the administrator  explain having her underage daughter there working at internship when you have to be over 18 years old so apparently they make their own rules and bend them to fit their needs or wants if anybody has their loved one at new horizons they should take them out and find a better day program because the new horizons in North Hills California is very  Bad for someone's mental growth that has a disability they don't try to help people with disabilities they help themselves by paying slave wages and making their own  profit</review>< user_id>

I WORK HERE, and its really amazing, the poeple with special needs I see as my children, which in hindsight its like there preparing you to have children, because if you dont have the pations to deal or to undrestand there needs then your not ready to have a child of your own.<//text>

Horrible place. Don't have accountability. Their van did a hit and run with clients in the car and the office pretented " not to know the daily whereabouts of their employees who have clients with them." Despicable!</review>

<text>Thanks to the magical, winning combination of COVID-19 & Postmates, I was FINALLY able to try Howlin' Rays for the first time ever!

I would have never waited in line for 2-3 hours in any given day but I surely will pay to have it delivered within the 2.5 mile radius limitations during this time (I drove 25 minutes each way to grab my bag of gold and get back home).

Yes, it was all that and more. The chicken was big, juicy and fresh.  The bun itself was delicious and the mild had just the perfect amount of spice.

As full as ever, It left me wanting more!<//text>< Name>

Very good cemitas. The cemitas had plenty of cheese and avocado. The milanesa and asada was well cooked, it remained juicy. No frills outdoor tables, it's a walk up window to order.<//Review>

Great tasting cemitas. It's a family owned small restaurant with no full enclosure. Parking is fine and on the weekends there's someone acting as a VIP for your car. Overall great place to go for some cemitas</Review>

First time I come here. I had a torta cubana. It was delicious! No complaint there. The place though needs a touch of remodeling, the tables are in really bad shape, the wall next to the tables is super dirty. It just feels unwelcoming if you plan to eat here. That's why I didnt give a 5 stars rating, other than that, what I had was delicious!!</text>

Close to the real thing, I tried the roasted pork, I was real good, my wife tried the milanesa but the only put one milanesa when on a traditional milanesa cemita they do 2 o 3 milanesas, great job on the amount of papalo classic herb on cemitas and the traditional oaxaca Chess !</Review>

The food is honestly great, they do seem to take a little long but I honestly believe that it's because they make everything fresh, and it shows in flavor texture and getting a hot plate, their selection is pretty good, they have a lot of things that most other Mexican places in the immediate area don't, but most of all the service and atmosphere is great,they are always so friendly and welcoming, I give them 5 stars for all these reasons.</Review>

Bad,bad business!  The bread so old and the milanesa same thing.  I can believe that they change me $8 dollars. No event close to the real cemitas! My first and last time here!< /text>

The presentation on the cemita was good, however I would say they need to add more flavoring to the asada, my buddy had the wet burrito al pastor 1/2 red 1/2 green the red half was real spicy, He loved it...the prices are very reasonable.. would come back again. Hopefully they'll have papalo next time... I've heard it makes the food taste better...<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Unfortunately, Cemita did not come with the ingredients "there is no papalo today" ???????
Worst of all, they didn't mention us when ordering and we realized that I didn't have papalo until half of the cake and I refer to this as cake because a traditional Cemita needs papalo. 2 pm Sunday not very busy, service 2 savor 3 (for lack of papalo) cleaning 1 need a little more detail in the cleaning.

Desafortunadamente , la Cemita no venía con los ingredientes “ no hay papalo hoy “ ???????
Lo peor de todo es que no nos mencionaron  al ordenar y nos dimos cuenta que no tenia papalo hasta la mitad de la torta y me refiero a esta como torta por que una Cemita tradicional necesita papalo . 2 pm domingo no muy ocupado , servicio 2 savor 3 ( por falta de papalo ) limpieza 1 necesitan un poquito más de detalle en la limpieza.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The worst restore the food was fatal I had to return everything. And my money was not returned to me, a hamburger with super-past meat I say this because I am a worker in a restaurant and then counts later and the cold potatoes and the taco of my caveza husband was totally disgusted. And the worst part is that you can not eat so many flies that have ai and the sailor does not wear gloves as in other restaurants. 😫😫😫😫 It's disgusting.

El peor restaurate la comida fue fatal tuve que regresar todo. Y no me regresaron mi dinero una hamburguesa con carne super pasada digo esto por que yo soy trabajadora en un restauran y medi cueta luego luego y las papas frias y el taco de mi esposo de caveza estaba total mete un asco. Y lo peor es que no se puede comer ai x tantas moscas que tienen ai y el cosinero no usa guantes como en otros restaurantes. 😫😫😫😫 es un asco .< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Well, this day I went to buy some cemas, I asked for them from Milanese and the old woman who works gave them to me asadas, I wanted them from Milanese, she started screaming at me and then we yelled and in the end she told me that she changed them but that was how I That old crazy lady from Olvia wanted it and she didn't change it to me. Please think that customers have a job and sell one to ask for it, not that witch wants

<review>Went at 8:30 am when the post office opens, and they never opened their doors!! I had to leave at 9 for work. There was a long line outside and nobody seemed to show up for work, the office looked empty when we peered through the crack of the door. Not a holiday either!!<//review>< date>

The worst customer service ever. I recommend the post office to fire the manager and the supervisor of that location, cause they’re doing a  Very poor job to get their employees in line. If you guys don’t want to serve  people just shut the location down seriously.< /Review>

This location has the lowest rating among all 5 USPS branches that serve this area. Almost all floor workers at this location are not trained well to communicate with customers. My business paid more than $100,000 on USPS postage and compare to esch single USPS location we have worked with, this place particular doesn't deserve our time and money<//Text>

< Review>
I know USPS normally gets a bad rep and that this location has some pretty bad reviews, but I just went to drop of a pre-labeled package and it was super easy and quick. The drop box was locked for some reason (weird) and there was a small line (normal) but an employee immediately walked up to me and collected my package. I was in and out of there in like 30 seconds.</Review>

I actually really appreciate USPS over all for their hard work through this difficult time. But this gray hair little lady at Harvest is the worst I have dealt with among all the USPS locations that I have been to. She lacks basic customer facing communication skill. She doesn't know how to talk like a person or treat customers like people. She either needs training in communication or she's not fit for customer facing positions.</Text>

<rating>1</rating><text>I have shipped from more than a dozen post offices in my time selling online and this is by far the absolute worst post office I’ve ever been too. I wish I lived somewhere else just to avoid this nightmare place. They can never ever just switch the bin in the back of the drop box so both boxes are always full every single day. Even saturdays after they closed and don’t have customers they can’t just switch out the bin or empty the other box. The post office always has a line out the door so if you need something plan to be here for at least an hour or 2, no matter what time you come. Terrible place. A few easy tweaks from management would help. They finally after coming here for a year marked that there is additional parking in the back and that packages can be dropped in back. They could just switch out the drop box bin for a fresh bin every couple hours and they sometimes expedite the line by having someone come out to help with the quick transactions. Do that all the time please.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dcde82905b9f65:0xef6f9717c8e68a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Call me or something so that I can help your employees find me, do SOMETHING other than sending it out and getting it back. Will someone PLEASE just deliver my package???</text>

<review>Went for a passport. Horrible experience. Same in the past merely picking up mail. I would drive an extra hour to avoid these horrible employees.

1. Called in advance. Was told walk in only. Arrived to find 10 people on appointment list.

2. The guy spent 30 minutes on the first appointment, but he had taken one in even before the designated time. The 10am appointment hadn't even been taken by 10:30am. There were 10 of us standing there, because they didn't even have chairs.

3. I witnessed 3 ladies yelling at CUSTOMERS. The manager came out and was equally rude. The customers are exasperated because everything is done without any reasonable organization or planning.

4. Several of us asked if it was worth it for us to stay. Merely ignored us and told us to stay and wait if we wanted. It was obvious he had no intention of trying to serve any of us. He was just laughing and chatting it up with the one person he saw in 1 hour. At least 5 us left in the first hour.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

This post office is poorly managed.  My package was never delivered to me but the tracking said delivered.  I filed a claim and they called me back and said that they can't find it.  I have received packages for other people at my house, the carriers are not paying attention.  I have to deliver mis-delivered packages to the write address.  Management is incompetent, training is almost non existent.  There is no accountability at this branch.<//text>

She demonstrated  extremely poor customer service. I was shocked by her temperament and rudeness to other customers as well, so I wasn't the only whose day was being ruined by her behavior. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, and if ones job calls on them to interact with the public, then part of the hiring process should ascertain whether the person's personality is a good fit for the role. If the folks that oversee the branch in Irvine (on Murphy Ave.) read this, please  please do some professional development training with your staff! Look at the average rating!!!

I was told I had to walk in for my passport. When I came in I was asked why I didn’t make an appointment. My package was lost last week. Yesterday I received a notification in my mailbox that my package was undeliverable because I wasn’t in my mailbox when they knocked. Apparently I have to wait at my mailbox if I want to receive my package to ensure they don’t lose another one.< /Text>

I would leave a zero review if possible.  Had a claim with them for over a week for a package I sent a customer labelled "delivered".  Could not get ahold of them via phone.  Finally after I did get through to a person, he said "hold on" and put me on hold for over an hour before finally hanging up.  Could not get through after that at all for days.  Still trying. Horrible service.</text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Moving myself and my business to an area controlled by this post office is proving to be the worst decision I have ever made for my business. I have had the pleasure of working with 3 other post offices in various parts of the country before working with Irvine, and all were excellent to work with.

Previous post offices I have worked with picked up packages on time, communicated well with me, and worked with me whenever an issue came up to make sure it never happened again.

The same cannot be said about this post office.

1. They do not answer their phone. In addition, no one at the post office believes me when I say they do not pick up the phone. When I was overseas and this post office didn't pickup my shipment as they were supposed to (more on that later) my wife and I ended up calling them 400 times over 3 days. They answered the phone 4 of those times, a 1% answer rate. And no, there is no voicemail. I spent 2 nights of a vacation I had planned for YEARS trying to call this post office. Worst vacation I ever had because of them.

2. I ship product once a month. Of the 4 times I have scheduled a pickup, never ONCE have they come to pick up the product without action from me. That is an incredible amount of incompetence.

3. They lie to me when I ask for an explanation. For instance, they told me one time that they didn't pick up the packages because I had the wrong apartment number. If they had actually gone to that apartment they would have seen 300 packages labeled and ready to go not even 10 feet away. Clearly, it's an excuse for incompetence. In addition, they had already ignored 2 pickup requests the 2 days prior that had the correct apartment. Everyone there wants to blame someone else, including me. They just don't care. After my packages had been sitting outside for 3 full days (it's a miracle none were stolen) and I was overseas, I finally got ahold of someone and asked them if they could guarantee they would be picked up. They told me no, they would make no such guarantee. Guess what? They didn't pick them up, again.

4. Even when they pick up the packages, they don't scan and ship them day-of. Sometimes they take more than 24 hours to get to them all. This often means my customers wait an addition 2 days because of this branch.

5. I called the regional office and left a voicemail complaining about my local post office. At least they had a voicemail. However, they never returned my calls. There is no accountability.

I'm not sure if this office is poorly managed, poorly staffed, underfunded or some other combination of those, but I have never had a business treat a customer that gives them so much money so poorly.

Now I'm sitting with 150 packages outside my door, and I know they won't be coming to pick it up. They haven't answered the phone, and I've emailed the branch manager and several other managers and haven't gotten a response. These packages will sit for an additional 3 days because Monday is a holiday, despite working until 1am last night to make sure they were ready for pickup. What a waste of work.

I will soon have customers emailing me complaining that their coffee hasn't arrived yet. Some will cancel. Others I will give discounts to to appease. I have lost thousands of dollars and no one at this post office cares.

I have never made a worse decision in my life than moving to an area controlled by this office.<//Text>< Pics>

HOWEVER, the make an appointment, one must CALL it in.   When I dial, the number rings for some time, then automatically disconnects.  I've been trying to dial for hours now... Awful service!  I realize I'm dealing with a government agency, but can they make the appointment scheduling available online if their phones obviously don't work?!<//review>< Pics>

Keep calling and the phone just rings and rings and then get a busy signal. My company has valuable equipment that has said it is out for delivery since the 15th and no one can tell us where it is. This is causing a huge loss in revenue and we have employees that have no workstations and are being paid to not be able to work because of the negligence of usps.</Review>

After waiting in slow long line and taking an already stamped envelope there to get a time stamp from them, I was yelled at by the post master lady behind the counter when she thought I was going to take a picture of the envelope.  She then grabbed the envelope from me saying I can’t do that, with no further explanation.
Rude & Embarrassing.
I’ve had other poor experiences at this location. and they are usually slow and not giving friendly service.  Disappointing.<//Text>

Don’t know why so many people complain about this post office... smh.

The clerks/sales associates are truly phenomenal, and treat each customer with utmost respect, and professionalism.

From the manager to the clerks, everyone is very genuine and warm-hearted in their service—to create a seamless and stressless experience.

What I have noticed, based on the complaints of any rudeness/attitude issues, is that the customers who address/confront the associates in a hard/direct and assertive manner—lacking courteousness—are the ones who receive the assertive responses back, from the associates.

I would say that follows the Spiritual Law of “Sowing & Reaping”, which says: If you sow good seeds, you will reap a good and tasty harvest. And, thusly, if you sow bad seeds, you will reap a bitter and distasteful harvest (aka “You get back what you put out”).

So, if anyone would like to have excellent customer service experiences, everywhere their life’s tasks take them, then my suggestion is to PUT OUT positive and respectful energy, so that you can receive it in return.

That sums up the essence of my review!

Many Blessings to the entire staff, in The Light and Love of The Lord Jesus Christ! 😇🙏🏼📫<//review>

The employees have the worst customer service and most disgusting attitude towards customers. I’m really shocked that this place is still open since they have a lot of hatred against some specific nationalities, especially the Asian employees that have really negative and rude behavior with some people. These people are very unprofessional and don’t deserve to work here. I quit going there and prefer to drive more, but deal with professional people.< /text>

There is no 0 star here so don't even take my 1 star rating serious!!
It took them 2 months to deliver packages to my new address.
Their postman messed with my parent's immigration letter and no one gave me a proper answer even an apology.  The supervisor (Regina) was so busy even to answer my phone calls or email. She didn't care at all.I have to wait for a year and pay more than $1000 for another application fee.

<text>I have had it with this place. They take great pleasure in sending packages back to other post offices in the area instead of delivering them to the Irvine address. I have absolutely no idea how they manage to screw this up so frequently. That said, our mail carriers are always delightful. It's just the bored or incompetent dweebs who arrange for delivery with whom I have had it up to here.<//text>< pics>

They have been holding my bosses packages hostage. We reached out on Friday to have them redelivered after the delivery person decided not to trek to our office and marked our packages as "Delivery Attempted." After spending half an hour on hold when out RESCHEDULED DELIVERY was attempted at 10pm the day before the scheduled time to a BUSINESS, the phone line cut out. Now we cannot get a hold of anyone from that station and have no clue where the packages are...</Review>

I don't often write reviews, but I just went to check the operating hours and noticed all the bad reviews for this post office.  I had the opposite experience - not only was the staff extremely helpful and courteous, they actually were personable as well.

Agreed. This location has the worst staff I've ever seen at a post office.

They are not really polite to customers (supposed they take you as "a customer"). The line is always long here and parking is packed. No doubt that staff's speed is the reason.

I tried to return a eBay merchant and I have a return label. The USPS refused to provide free tap to seal my box even it is a "priority mail". All staffs didn't show any sense of sorry and asked me to purchase their tap  for $3.59 (cheapest). Also, they can't even explain the reason clearly in English. I believe the only possible reason is my box is too large. The staff told me that they only provide a priority tape for flat rate and express mail.</review>

TRINH is the WORST employee I have ever come across. I absolutely agree with Scott's review below. I would avoid her at all costs and have already submitted a corporate complaint against her. As soon as I approached her counter, she was already negative and rude to begin with. She asked me what I wanted and when I told her I wanted to ship a package with a hold for pickup option, she told me it could only be done via express mail. I showed her my previous labels of I was able to do this via priority mail before and she basically told me she didn't care. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she told me no. When I asked her to explain to me further on why this couldn't be done via priority mail she simply told me "because you can't" and insisted I leave. I don't understand how she still has a job when so many people have complained about her before.</Text>

<review>I usually go to FEDEX where I always experience a very good service there. With this USPS office, the service is horrible, I stopped by with a few pages of docs to mail out via priority mail which I got a label printed out already, waited in line and then the first greeting I got from one small lady is "what you want me to do?!..." said in a rude tone with knitted brows. I am just wondering : does this lady have any sense of customer service?!!< /review><time>1521568228712</time>< Rate>

The staff "an old asian lady" is a super mean lady. I bring my un seal box to ship. She kept asking me to buy their tap instead of I use theirs or borrow from someone.  I do not know what is the point to buy 5 dollar tap and use just once? I finally decide to buy one and left it for others to use.  I do not want some else be judged by her for such stupid request.  -- shame on her !<//text>

I just returned from this office frustrated.  The woman at the far left was very mean and had zero sense of customer service.  I don't know why they have her at the front desk.  She is a small may be Japanese or Korean woman.  I was at the front of the line waiting to have my ready certified mails to be stamped.  She sent me to the window, even though she could stamp them.  I had to wait at the window for a long time and  the girl there just disappeared.  I went back to ask her and she said she could not help me because there was a long line.  What a jerk! she was the one to send me away!.  I hope this office train their employees better!< /Text>

I was actually impressed with a post office! After walking inside a nice gentleman helped me with finding the right box and how to operate the machine. I opted for the line as I needed stamps.  Only one person ahead of me on this Thursday afternoon. Line moved quickly and the lady who assisted me was super nice and gathered all these stamps for me to choose. Very nice people !

Although it didn't affect me this trip, I did notice two people were waiting for someone to help them on the other side , looked like they were waiting to pick something up. No one showed up to that window in the 5 or so minutes I was there.< /Review>

The first time I sent certified mail and received signature confirmation, apartment complex never received it.  I called post office and they said somehow it went back into their mail and they would get it there to the apartment complex, a week later still nothing.  I later found out that it was returned to sender (this is after they already had a signature confirmation).  Next times I sent a laptop (insured it for $1,000) and never received it.  No one at apartment complex signed for it, but USPS has a signature confirmation of a random person and says it was delivered.  They have delivered it to the wrong person and received a fake signature.  I have filed a claim and 2 appeals and all have been denied.  I paid extra money for insurance in case something happens and they are still denying it.  USPS has had very bad service.  I would not send anything valuable.  If anyone has had any experience like this and has been able to resolve it, please let me know.<//text>

Firstly I came to truck my missing mail. This mail got the destination, but unfortunately the recipient didn’t get it. I came to this office to get an info about current location of this mail, cause I know that undelivered mails generally go to the nearest post office. So I came to this office just to confirm this info. And I was surprised when the supervisor answered that she isn’t able to do it. I supposed she didn’t got me right and then I said that she doesn’t understand me. And I was really surprised when she answered, that I didn’t understand her. After a few minutes of this worthless talks, she took a paper with my tracking number and went somewhere. After some minutes more I tried to ask the same another manager, but no one agreed to even speak with me. And then the men in the pick up window typed 911 and tried to threaten me, by saying that he is going to call the police. I answered him “Ok, call.” And of course he didn’t call to anyone and went away as a woman before. After 5 minutes of waiting of something the women brought my paper and gave me the info that I asked half an hour ago. It’s ridiculous that people who work in this post office can’t properly do their work until making someone nervous<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Incredible ... They must be the cockiest b*strds I have ever encountered .. Disregard any official guideline their website gives because "they know better because they work here longer". God must they hate their jobs. Instead of something vaguely resembling customer service they point to some made up rule with a smirk in their face speculating that you don't expend the energy actually getting your right. If they wouldn't have a monopoly and people actually having a choice, they would go out of business in a matter of days.< /review>< Pics>

Worst and most irresponsible staff ever seen they delivered my critical identity document to someone else address and then didn't even responded to my query.
When i visited post office african American lady didn't even bothered to give information instead said your case is closed and she just simply trying to avoid situation. She told me the supervisor will call in few hours no call came i called back someone picked up after 6th attempt and said please come in 5 mins and pick up letter stating your identity mail is lost i went to usps office and the guy who lost my mail and was supposed to provide me letter left office without informing...
They will understand only when they will suffer like me... It's a curse to these usps guys< /text>

Horrible service. From workers to managers. They lost my laptop. It was delivered to the wrong address and signed for. Filed an appeal only to be denied 3 times. Reason it was denied was because package was signed for BUT BY THE WRONG ADDRESS IT WAS DELIVERED TO. Signature was scribble so no one could confirm who signed up. End result, post office lost $1,300 macbook. Not even cooperate office was helpful. Since package was signed and delivered, there was nothing they could do. US tax dollars hard at work here</Text>

Went last Saturday after looking online for this post office hours.  I was in line with half a dozen other people who had also looked up on line for their hours and read as I did 9am opening hours and on the door was 9am too!   At 9:15am, an employee came out to get the person who had a passport appointment and said that they opened at 10am, NOT 9am.  We asked why was it not changed on the door or online and she said that was a question for her manager who she kept telling to change it because people are upset with her every Saturday!    No wonder the post office is doing so poorly - just a simple communication and courtesy and they can't even do that.  I am sending several packages abroad and over the years have spent a lot of money with them so don't think I'm asking for much but simple customer service.</text>

Do not show up on scheduled pik up request, just mark it picked up next day.
Do not put picked up packages into the system right away.
Do not pick up their phone - Ever!
Put your mail to a wrong security box or give you keys from wrong box.

They over charged with rediculous non sense $22 fee if you don’t renew on time. I was there exactly 10 days after the grace period that you are allowed to pay without any extra fees but they still charged me. The manager name is Christy and I had to come 3 times to talk to her because she was late to work and when I finallly she was there and  I explain my situation and asked her to waive the fees. She was extremely rude. I don’t understand how she is the manger of this post office. I had a horrible experience with them.

The staff will not contact you when they tell you they will just to get you to leave. The incompetent staff miss filed my mail into the wrong po box for 2 MONTHS. I keep telling them I am have not gotten one piece of mail fo r2 months, not even junk mail. their comment was "that is a little odd."  even after filing a complaint with the main post office this post office NEVER contacted me. I guess the bonuses for Amazon package deliverys are more important.<//Review>

They are absolutely horrible. They cancelled my forward, so the package got sent back to the sender and I had to wait another month for it. And when it finally came back, I wasn't home to receive it so they left a notice. The notice said to pick it up anytime after 10:00 the following day. When I went to the post office to pick it up, they didn't have it and said that I need to come back a few days later to pick it up. Horrible service, would give 0/5 if possible.<//Text>

<Review>Worst service ever. They delivered my package to the wrong office in my complex, I've been waiting for almost 2 weeks now. They don't answer their phone. I called and got an internal line to call on and the person I spoke with kept saying she'd look into it and never called back like she said she would. They keep saying the carrier is looking for it, but it seems that nothing is happening. This is for a customer who ordered their product almost a month ago. At the very least, pick up your phone.<//Review>< Pics>

A few workers here are racist and sexist. Never had such a horrible and rude experience trying to ship a package. This location has the worst staff i've ever seen at a post office. I've always used USPS in the past, but never again, you've just lost a customer<//text>

<text>This is the 3rd attempt at getting my daughters passports renewed. After miscommunication from 2 other post offices in the same vicinity with bad services and rude attitudes ( will not delve here but see yelp reviews) we made an appointment here to get it done. Lin who helped us was very friendly and professional. She was efficient and quick. Would have gave her a 5 stars but had to wait 15 min ( after scheduled appointment time cuz previous appt. had 4 people in their group). She did apologize which was nice.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Horrible experience. In the usps office at UC Irvine. They let me use the envelope to ship the  package like this. In this post office, the lady insists that my cloth won’t fit into the envelope. She didn’t even give me an envelope to show that it will fit. Just keep telling me that according to her experience, it won’t fit. Excuse me? Stop coming to this office. Their attitude is a serious problem. Go to the UC Irvine post office in the UTC.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcde82905b9f65:0xef6f9717c8e68a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I was going to give this 4 stars, but what happened today has upset me. I came before opening and realized I was too early, so I had to  leave for my car to get fixed at Toyota (had a 9am appointment there). I went to get my car the second it was done and I left Toyota at 1:50. There was a ton of traffic, and I got to the PO at 2:04pm (there were people inside but close time was at 2). The man whom I usually admire opens the window, and as I try to explain myself. HE SHUTS THE WINDOW IN MY FACE just like they do in movies and shows where the guy giving service is mean and rude. Today was my absolute only day off, and the guy said "Come back Monday" which I know I'm working all the way until Thanksgiving and Black Friday. My package has already been in the PO for close to a week already. I work for The Walt Disney Company, and the service I give is so different than what this man demonstrated.<//text>< Gmap_id>

OH AND THE FACT THAT I CALLED BACK AGAIN AND THE AUTOMATED PERSON SAID "we can not take your phone call right now call back later" ................<//Review>< resp>

As i walked up to the counter she was still rolling her eyes at the last customer!!!

Neglect customers: Ringed bells three times still no one comes to the window when agents from other window don't wish to help;

Inaccurate information: Passport walk-in renew on Saturday becomes appointment only which contradicts website information.

Kind of what people expected from government agencies.</review>

Stood in line to pick up package for 40 minutes with no clerk at the window. The line went from 4 person to 2 because 3 of them left in frustration after the long wait. Turns out the clerk spent the entire time looking for a package which took 30 minutes to find. Sure it is the holidays and you'd expect more traffic, but if it takes 30 minutes to locate each package...< /Review>

On the phone 40 minutes wait was suggested to get a hold of someone in the Murphy P.O, where the Orange post office while i put Irvine on hold took 9 minutes, why do they allow this post office to do so awful ? I had to choose a rating star to post this otherwise I really would have chose none.</text>

Bad bad bad customer service, never want to come back there again. This is why USPS is not doing well. I would rather using UPS or FEDEX instead.</text>

Great spot to see gorgeous girls who are friendly, attentive and fun. Don't go there if you're broke and cheap. They are worth making it rain. The establishment follows all health guidance and the place is clean and well maintained. Best late night food also hands down.< /review>

Great place to meet outgoing ladies of the night. By the way, I frequent this place only for the spectacular late night food, no other reason besides the food. But definitely a a place with beautiful people in it.< /text>

The place itself is nice, the bartender was extremely rude and unprofessional, no welcome, no smile, she looked as if we were bothering her even though the place was completely empty, and she ripped off my change. The place was dead and the drinks were extremely over priced for such an empty place with that kind of horrible service.< /text>

Don’t waste your money on lap dances at this location. You cannot touch. They don’t answer the phone either. It is okay for others to touch in non lap dance situations.<//Text>

<Review>They treat you pretty well here and the drink prices are good. There's only no cover from Sunday-Thursday, but it's just $5 for Friday and Saturday so that's fine. Great dancers, nice pool tables.< /Review>< Rate>

This place sucks donkey balls. Don’t waste your time or your money. $10 cover and nasty ass chicks. No joke 4 patrons inside, a couple of fat sloppy managers and that’s apparently too much for the bartender to handle.</review>

Have UFC and Boxing  pay per view events on Saturday nights .  Charge a 15 cover maybe 25 for  vip seating and I guarantee  youll pack the place.< /Text><username>Jaime L.<//username>< Pics>

Go ask for DANNY Do not buy your mattress anywhere else. They take their time to make sure you're fully satisfied with your purchase. I'm highly impressed with the phenomenal customer service i received. THANK YOU AGAIN DANNY< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>It’s my first time buying from Sit N Sleep and I really loved their customer service. Amanda was super helpful and knowledgeable, she offered me a lot of options as it’s my first time buying a mattress She really helped me choose the right one. Unlike other stores that brings you to their most expensive brands, this store really prioritizes customer’s comfort. Amanda and David really helped me with finalizing my purchase. I’m pretty sure I will go back to them for my future purchases.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
I purchased a mattress from another company in February 2021 and have had lower back pain since.  I walked into Sit and Sleep and was immediately assisted by Amanda. She not only took time to explain every question I had,  she provided information I had no idea existed regarding mattress purchasing. This has been a great experience and I truly believe I've found my mattress sole mate. Can't wait for my first night of actual rest..< /review>

<Text>Amanda is very friendly and professional.
She tried to find the best mattress that suit my physical condition.
I felt at home while I was in the big warehouse.
I already recommanded Sit n Sleep in Glendale to friends and family.
Thank you Amanda~ wish you the best and
hope to see you again when I move to bigger place in the future^^</Text>< Pics>

We started from the basic models and moved our way up until I found what I was looking for.  The mattress was in my home 48hrs later with great white glove service.  Couldn't be more pleased and feel I received a great deal.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Bought a bed and mattress at the Glendale Sit and Sleep store. And the customer service could not have been better. Danny Shebet did an excellent job in helping us pick out the perfect mattress. I would definitely recommend this store to anyone. And if you want a sales person that will give you the best service of all, ask for Danny Shebat.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
We just moved to LA and bought an adjustable bed from Danny at Sit and Sleep in Glendale. We did a lot of research before we made our decision and visited 5 other large mattress stores in the neighborhood. Sit and Sleep has by far the largest selection of beds in this area. Danny’s explanations of the pros and cons of various products were clear and helpful. We appreciated the fact that the Sit and Sleep showroom is extremely clean, with good ventilation. Very important in the age of Covid. The bed we chose was very comfortable (of course) and the price was fair, especially compared to the competition. Next day delivery a big plus with Labor Day weekend coming in 2 days. This was an enjoyable buying experience thanks to Danny’s straight-forward approach. A big thanks to Danny.<//Review>

Shopping for a mattress ain't as easy as it used to be. So many variables and accessories. Luckily Aly ( I hope I spelled his name correctly ) was on hand to help out and explain and demo all the different choices that were available. I had never heard of a bed with its own remote control. It even has a relaxation button. I learned a lot that night thank you Aly for all the info and patience. Although we didn't purchase anything that night we've got it down to 2 possibles and we're going back this evening to test drive both of them again and buy the winner. Highly recommend this store and Aly.<//text>

I went in and spoke to the store manager, Ali Tehranchi. He was so helpful and patient during the whole process. I ended up purchasing a Sterns and Foster and am getting it delivered this weekend. Overall a great experience and would recommend this store to anyone interested in getting a new mattress!<//Text>

Visited Sit ‘n Sleep in Glendale. I was greeted by Sleep Consultant, Danny Shebat. He showed me the best mattress options according to my requests and needs. He’s polite, professional, but overall knowledgeable in the mattress area. I highly recommend this location and consultant. Five Stars!<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>After purchasing a new mattress at the Glendale location, I discovered that Sit 'n Sleep doesn't refer to bedding, but to customer service. My wife and I purchased a new mattress in March, replacing our worn out bed, which was also purchased at Sit 'n Sleep years ago at a different location. Ali, the sales associate got us into a comfortable mattress and we made the purchase.  And that's when the problems began.  We slept on it for a week, and we both woke up sore.  The middle of the bed seemed worn down.  I called Ali and left messages and sent emails but he never replied. My wife called and finally reached him.  He basically couldn't remember us and told us to buy a "topper"  for around $400 or so.  After numerous phone calls, we finally got an inspection which determined that our mattress was "defective".  My advice is this:  avoid Ali and the Glendale store, and if there is a problem, don't think customer service is going to help you.  Sit 'n Sleep has expanded and they don't have the same care for their customers as they used to.  Consider other mattress stores before you purchase.< /Review>< pics>

This is my 2nd time here, I purchased my first tempurpedic bed 10 years ago, and I’ve loved that bed for years.. Today I came back with my husband to purchase our new king sized bed for our new home! Ali made the experience so easy! We were provided with protective coverings (covid era shopping is weird lol) and we tested out a few beds and found the perfect one. Ali was available to answer all questions, and was super friendly and fun. Also got $100 off from a promo I saw on the website. And free shipping too! You can’t beat it. 10/10 highly recommend! Ask for Ali :)< /review>

<Text>Mattress shopping can be such a nightmare. We tried a Caspar mattress and were so dissatisfied. The smell gave us headaches and when we asked about it were told the smell would go away after a few days. Weeks later it seemed to only get worse. Never buying a boxed mattress again.

Ali at sit n sleep answered all our questions and concerns and was extremely helpful. Truly a pleasure to do business with him. I highly recommend this place.< /Text><name>julian seidenberg<//name>< Date>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>My husband and I were in desperate need of a new mattress because our old one was too soft and lumpy and causing hip and back problems.  I did research and was so happy to find SIT'N SLEEP in Glendale, California which was close to us. The sales representative, Ali Terrance was professional, informative with a good sense of humor. He wore a mask, as did we, and I was impressed that the store provided hygienic ways for us to try the beds for the right fit. We found the mattress we love and look forward to them picking up our old one and setting up our new one. It couldn't have been easier and we can't wait to sleep on our new mattress that will be delivered tomorrow! Yay!

Thank you Ali @ SIT'N SLEEP. You were fabulous and when the time comes to get a new one again, you'll be hearing from us again.

Sincerely,

<Text>My experience was perfect! I went in to take advantage of the sleep mattress calculator they use to assist you in choosing the correct mattress. My sales person was Ali the store manager. Ali was very friendly and professional. He was able to answer all my question and additionally explain to me why I was experiencing the sleep trouble I currently have. He then helped me select a mattress that was right for me and I was on my way. The whole visit took maybe 30 minutes. Definitely worth the time.</Text><Date>1564956197081< /Date><Name>Lonnie Etter< /Name><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

He took the time to listen to what she was looking for and showed her a variety of options. We have shopped at this Sit 'n Sleep location for nearly 15 years and would highly recommend them to anyone shopping for a new Mattress.</Text>< rate>

Had a great experience here today when hubby and I were shopping for a new mattress set. We worked with Ali, one of the shop managers, who was extremely helpful and funny without being pushy. He had a lot of great suggestions to help us in making our mattress selection. The store also had a large variety of mattresses, as well as reasonable financing options. We ended up settling on a Seely mattress which will be delivered to us on a day of our choice, free of charge. They also offer to take away your old mattress and properly dispose of it. Highly recommend checking this place out when you are in the market for new bedding!!!< /review>

<review>I had 20 minutes to buy a mattress, and I did it with ease .   Are use the in-store bed selector tool, told Danny Shebat  my price range. He then showed me three different beds in my price range, starting with his ideal pick.   He also showed me a bed that was a couple hundred dollars more, and another one that was a couple hundred dollars less ... I ended up going with his ideal pick.  I will return for my next best purchase.< /review>< Pictures>

Glendale Sit and Sleep was truly wonderful.  Quick, responsive and best of all knowledgeable.  Dennis was my sales consultant, and helped not only in the store but also over the phone.   He deserves more than 5 stars.  Many thanks to him for a great experience.</Review>

Our salesman, Juan, took his time explaining to us the different qualities of the different mattress sets we looked at.  He didn't try to rush us along, and it was nice to take our time and test the beds that had been selected for us by the machine at the beginning of the store that lets you know which firmness would be best for you.  We picked out one that suited us, and added a few things on, and Juan took care of the rest.< /review>

We went to Sit and Sleep with a budget and a rough idea of what we wanted. Our sleep consultant Danny was absolutely amazing. He set us up on the sleep calculator bed then took the time to show us all our options. He never once pressured us into anything. He was enganging and invested in our experience.</review>

With so many mattresses and stores to choose from, we took to online reviews for some guidance.  Danny Shebat got such great reviews, we called the store to make sure he was working that Sunday then came in and he had the perfect mattress for us in 10 seconds flat.  Back-pain relief was almost immediate.  And two months later, we're still singing his praises.  We were lucky also to visit the Glendale store because the firm mattress chosen for us isn't available at all Sit 'N Sleep stores.< /text>

Danny was very good at explaining the various mattress brands n types ie medium, firm etc.  I never felt pressured.  I bought my last two mattresses at Sit n Sleep and have been satisfied with my purchases.   I look forward to receiving my new mattress tomorrow.  I also have a friend who in the last couple of months bought her mattress from Sit n Sleep.</review>

had found an adjustable base online after doing a lot research; called Glendale store to see if one was actually in showroom, which Ali was able to quickly confirm; drove to Glendale and Ali was great in-person as well - encouraged me to take my time inspecting and experiencing the adjustable base without bothering me while I took my time doing so; when I had some additional questions, he was efficient and straight-forward in answering them; sold!  Ali is a real asset to your company - I'd make the trip back to Glendale to work with him and would comfortably refer my friends to him<//text>

Beware of what you'll sign!!!!
All sales are final. NO REFUND. NO EXCHANGE ( check out the photos) it's like walking to a AUCTION YARD. They will exchange only when you pay couple hundred bucks.
Terrible experience unlike the advertisement!!! There's nothing free even exchange and you'll be charged for 20% restocking fee toward an exchange of equal or greater value mattress!!!!!!!!!
We purchased tempur-adapt medium hybrid mattress for $2000 since usually I sweating a lot at summer nights and the sleep consultant at store offer us that one and told us that it's gonna keep me cool during the night and asked me to touch the fabric of mattress and see how cool it is !!!!!
At that moment he was right, mattress was super cool since the AC was on in store and the AC vent was above that mattress.
He asked me to sign some papers but he didn't explain well what are they all about, I know that it's my responsibility to read all of them but somehow you are trusting the salesperson.
Got it delivered, installed it and .......
Noticed that the mattress by itself it's not cool, it holds the surrounding temperature and from that moment my nightmares begun and I can't return it since I have to exchange it with higher or equal price( apparently that was the best vs anything else that they had in store) and unfortunately I have to keep that mattress since they are not doing returns even you pay restocking fee.

Went in to this place planning to shop for a new  mattress the smell was just atrocious. I couldn't stand it for more than a couple minutes and neither could my spouse. Still lingering.  No better way to get a bad rating sorry not sorry.</review>

Great customer service, Ali was great, took his time to explain our options and let my fiance and i take our time to decide what bed we wanted because we were pretty indecisive walking back and forth between two of the mattresses. Would definitely recommend!<//review>

<Text>Paid $1400 for a mattress set that started sagging on us after 1.5 years and called customer service to warranty it. They sent a 3P inspection company that latter came to inspect it...As the technician was measuring the bed he said " yeah this is definitely sagging " and 2 weeks later they tell us our claim has been rejected!! Both my wife and I are experiencing back issues now and SIT N SLEEP doesn't even want to live up to their warranty!!!! NEVER AGAIN...STAY AWAY FROM THESE THIEVES!!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Well kept bathrooms and beautiful open spaces to walk around and get the feeling back in your legs after a long journey. This was a welcome sight after driving through the desert for a few hours. They have a natural history learning center that will teach you about the beautiful surroundings. I will come back!</Text>

As of 10pm on 4/4/2021 when we were here, this rest stop was open: clean, well-lit, very accessible. No photos to post, but may have very recently reopened, as there were maintenance workers around while we were there.</Text>

< Review>
Visiting the state of California has been unpleasant with having to find a restroom open for the public to use and we happen upon this rest stop. Grateful for the rest stop but so unsanitary with the porta potties.  I feel so bad for the workers there tonight, cleaning completely full porta potties, with urine spilling over onto the floor and the urinals full of urine.
The washing stations were out of water except one.
I am sorry but it would be better to open the restrooms than have to pee in one of these porta potties or close it down completely. So unhappy with this stop. San Bernardino, keep up with sanitation or shut it down.</Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>For what appears to be a newer rest area, this place was not very impressive. One of the sinks in the bathroom was not working, two of the soap dispensers were not working, and at least one of the hand dryers was not working. Plus, how come when I travel in Utah or Idaho they manage to provide warm water and warm air for me to wash and dry my hands but for some reason California fails?< /review>< Pics>

<review>Rest stop is very nice looks brand new when we went by unfortunately there was a truck with trailer that caught on fire on I-15 north bound, everyone was ok and got out safely but all their stuff burned down. It was a family camping and had all their stuff inside the trailer. There was no way to put it out so they had to watch it burn.< /review>< pics>

Some parts seem to be under construction but otherwise it's decent.

There's a nice pet area and the bathrooms are pretty clean.

Plenty of toilet paper as well. There's also a unisex bathroom available!< /Review>

This rest stop is closed more often than not.  Continually under “repair”.  At least let people know in advance when the area is closed (your highway signs along the roads several miles out).  Not a good impression  for your state.<//Text>

<text>Not the best rest stop to stop at especially if you have little ones who need a diaper changing table. I had to change my daughter on the floor in the handicap stall because there was no other place. We've also tried to go into the family bathroom but it is always locked and closed.</text>< Pictures>

Pretty much brand new rest area and one of the two major rest spots between Vegas and Barstow. Picnic Areas under awnings with cement tables perfect for road trip lunches.  The only area lacking is the pet area, nothing more than a patch of dirt for your pooch.<//text>

Motorists appreciate the fancy rest stops but all of us would much more appreciated if the state of California could actually keep the rest stops open all the time
Since usually a third to half of all California rest stops are closed for absolutely not essential reasons, the failure of California to keep rest stops open is a direct reflection to the poor quality of management that supervises  rest stops.
If these people would be penalized when rest stops were closed I am sure the rest stops would be kept open all the time, but when they close the rest stop they don't have to do maintenance service and their job is easier so they close them at any excuse< /text>< Pics>

It's a rest area. People don't come here on the basis of a review or to see the magnificent sights. They come to "rest." However, rest areas in the state are being renewed and this one was recently rebuilt. Given the choice of the gas station in Baker with the wheel for a key chain and this, this wins. They actually gave it some character and it is clean. Compared to other rest areas in the state, this deserves five stars.< /text>

It's excellent when it's open. I travel the road from Las Vegas to Barstow often. This rest stop has been closed or port-a-potty only 10 of the last 12 trips. Really disappointing when you consider that those trips were over the course of 6 months. Is it that poorly built it does it get vandalized that often?< /Text>

<Text>This is the rest stop of all rest stops. Be certain to stop and rest here. The experience will surely change your life! You will discover an inner calm and the determination needed to move on. You will leave this place better than you arrived. You will depart refreshed and clean, courageous and ready to face the road ahead! Stop here and find enlightenment, or just what you need to keep moving forward.</Text><username>Felix Marvin<//username>< response>

If you need to stretch and have a good view it's a a good place to do it,  the only downside is that they don't have much bathrooms.</Review>

<text>My wife and I loved it! It was definitely an oasis literally in the middle of the desert, in the middle of the night, when we really needed a rest. It had just about everything you could expect and a little bit more at a rest stop and everything and first-class condition. Vending, freshwater, lots of other people for security and lots of fresh water and did I say lots of fresh water and lots of fresh water.<//text>< pics>

Great place to rest from horrible Vegas traffic. For the most part it is a very clean place with some new toilets, but some of it has been kind of run down. I know it's not their fault. Other than that it's a pretty good rest stop with big bathrooms and tons of parking it's a good place to get out of the car and stretch a bit.</Review>

What can I say, when you got to go you got to go! It's a nice place to stop on your way to Las Vegas from LA. My visit was not perfect. When I got there they were cleaning the woman's bathroom and the line was super long. Waited for the family bathroom. Of course as soon as it was my turn the woman's bathroom open back up and everyone else got to go in right away. Not really their faults glad they're keeping it clean!</review>

A large open space for a huge rest stop awaits you here. Lots of restrooms and two buildings, lots of picnic area, place for the dog, and the historical marker that's very interesting. Enjoy your rest whatever it involves<//review>

Pretty good rest area!  Great picnic tables.  The bathrooms are a bit beat up though... Some travelers enjoy etching in graffiti on the toilet seats.  Well lit at night.</review>

< Review>
Nature called past the witching hour and it didn’t feel entirely like a prison bathroom. Only reason I didn’t give five star is because I don’t quite understand the criteria for reviewing a bathroom but google suggested I do. The place is clean, well lit, no holes in the walls, people were not lurking around the bushes in the distance. Got back in the car, drove off and moments later witnessed one of the worst vehicle collisions I’ve ever seen and i even have 24 yrs as a paramedic.</Review>

<text>Clyde drexler was here and its disappointing the rest area wasn't named after him. Miami's leading points guard for a ton of season's cant get a rest stop named after him and probably his favorite one at that. I've seen him there a couple times because I frequent it quite a bit to loiter and such. It's a warm spot.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Clean, autoflush toilets. Area for dogs on leashes to walk around. Men's, women's, and neutral bathroom. I'd say ADA compliant and wheelchair accessible. Stalls are large.< /text>

Everytime I come through, the car side toilets are closed, which is a hardship for ♿. Walking to the truck side is challenging, and there is never any warning in the lot until you park and then find you have to go the Truck side toilet building. With this in mind, this rest area (along with S bound) are only intermittently handicap accessable. Shame on Cal-Tans</Review>

What can you say it's a rest area off the highway the bathrooms were very clean there is places that have picnic tables with some shade to eat. There is handicap access to the restrooms and picnic areas, did not stop there and eat so I'm not sure if there are grills by the picnic areas or not I do not remember but I wasn't looking for them either.< /Review>

It is clean and spacious but not a lot of shade. The parking lot for automobiles was a little cramped and I worried about hitting someone who was coming out from between the cars to cross. The trash cans were full and the were a lot of bees. Biggest complaint was that the men's restroom was large but there were only the stalls and a few urinals. I was there on a busy weekend but the line was very long for a place that specializes in being a place to use the toilet. Very clean though and it works as a rest stop. I would visit again if I needed to on my way to Vegas.<//review>

If your going to close one restroom, then put a sign or notification to not use...and IDK, maybe an arrow to the other building. Walked to the small car restroom with a bum foot, then all the way around it until i noticed it was closed and had to walk all the way to the truckers restroom, which had no soap. Normally, I would not complain about no soap at a rest area, but it appears they have staff on site, so do ur job if thats the case.< /Review>

I drive between Vegas and Ventura County once a month for business and this has become my go to stop on the way home. I usually try to make the drive without stopping but this place is always clean, well lit and well maintained (for a rest stop in the middle of nowhere).</text>

<text>May be i was on a wrong day here or the other rest area was closed, the rest rooms were crowded. Huge queue to enter rest rooms. The auto parking was literally full and people parked in truck parking area. The rest rooms were obviously dirty with the amount of people using it and no housekeeping person on site. Only 3 urinals in a rest room for high volumne of people is bad design. Considering other interstate rest area, this is poorly managed and maintained.< /text></record></dataset><record>

This rest stop does the trick when an accident shuts down I-15 at Zzyzx Rd. There is plenty of open space for kids to run around and burn off energy while waiting for the freeway to open again. The bathrooms are large, but I knocked off stars because I didn't find and infant changing table.< /Text>

It's pretty clean and the stalls have more privacy than most rest area. There's no mirror  but there's plenty of stalls which is good.</review>
