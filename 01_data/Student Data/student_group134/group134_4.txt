Nice store. Only problem is they sell only Huskies and KTM and a couple Suzuki's. So the selection isn't too big.< /review>

Great staff. Had to take my bike in for service. These guys are very knowledgeable and super courteous. I would highly recommend this shop or if you are looking to buy a bike. If they don't have what you're looking for they can always get it. Just ask.< /Text>

In my years dealing with Fators Motorcycle Sales & Service, I have never been disappointed. The makes & models of bikes in stock is impressive. Craig sets the tone of effort and honesty. His and all the employees advice is invaluable. Justin, Joe and Kevin are top rated mechanics. The parts department people are fast and will find exactly what you need. Corey is always good for a laugh.<//review>

I purchased a new KTM from Fator’s at an excellent price 1year ago. I was very happy with how everything went. I am even more impressed with their customer service a year later. My rear brake stopped working so I asked them about it. They told me to bring it in so they could look at it. 1 hour later I received a call saying they were all finished and for no charge. Very happy with the entire company. Would highly recommend Fator’s and KTM.<//Text>

Just drove up from the bay area and bought a new 2017 Husqvarna TC250.  I have purchased countless bikes over the years and my experience at Fator's is hands down the best i have ever had.  This family owned business offers a level of professionalism, knowledge, experience and courtesy that is second to none.  I will continue to make the drive north to do business with this shop!<//Text>

Local owned.  Craig and his family operate a great shop.  The mechanics in the garage do excellent work.  Every time I go to Fators, the staff is always smiling and friendly no matter what time of day.  Convenient location in the center of Redding with plenty of parking.<//Review>

Been bringing my bikes to these guys for about 2 years.  It is worth noting they are above average and they have gotten the job done right every time.  Kudos. Also if you like dirt bikes stop by and take a look at their inventory- so many cool bikes, it is almost as much fun as checking out the factory bikes at the Hangtown MX AMA motocross.  Seriously the have allot of cool bikes there...</text>

Definitely happened while being worked on in the shop, avoid this place getting anywhere near your bike because they do not treat your property with respect.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I would never take anything there for one they tried getting over on me then I go there about a week or two later just because no one in town had the spark plug size that I need for my rm dirt bike so I told myself I geuss I'll go there and get one even after they tried getting over on me .so I get one that all they had so I go home and put it in and started it up and drove it up and down my driveway acouple of times then my girlfriend rides it and she tells me that it's not running right I say it probably falling the plug just because I put to much oil in the gas so keep the RPM up well she decided not to ride it anymore so couple days later I try starting it and it will not start so I figured it got to be the plug so I get another plug for it and it doesn't still start so I take the top off and see that there's a dent in the top of my piston that I just got it replaced so I take the plug out and the new one and there different sizes so they blow my bike up I'm so made and you thank they will make it right .they all ready tryed getting over on me in the beginning so you think they will make it right and why would I have them fix it any ways since they sold me wrong  parts . Don't do business there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Text>Can't say enough about these guys.  I had a rented BMW and the rear tire was soon toast, the agency sent me to them for a replacement.  20 miles out the tire went flat, I called them and they sent an employee out with one of the service guys personal truck to pick me up!!!!!  Tire was replaced pronto and I was on my way!  Great guys, family owned and operated.

<Text>The quads are superior; however, I took my quad in for its new tune and oil change (it was running fine). Unfortunately my new quad came back backfiring when cold and a new oil leak. I checked the oil filter and found it had not been changed. I did not take the quad back for fear worse results would be incurred :-(! They did not get a chance to "make it good" because the head mechanic gave me a very uneasy feeling. I have never been back and will never go back.<//Text>< user>

We took in our scooter after the oil filter came off and it stopped running and made a funny noise. Drove 2 hours to this shop to drop it off, after explaining exactly what happened. First off they took 3 days because they were so convince they may need to replace the whole engine without even looking at it. After finding out that an engine was thousands of dollars they got the ok to take it apart and look at it. Basically they changed the battery, changed the oil but Not the filter and checked the compression. After coming back 2 hours to pick it up the guy tells us it's smoking and the o rings probably are damage so it's using oil. They never took the engine apart and return it to us with issues that we took it to the professionals to fix. 250 bucks later for nothing and a big waste of time, we have a not so fixed scooter and will NOT be back!< /text>

I've purchased 2 Quads from Fators and their Sales philosophy was much better than any other dealer within 100 miles.  I'm talking all dealers, ie: Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki, etc, etc.
After laying out the criteria I wanted in a quad, ie: 4 Stroke, Automatic, 4WD, Low Range, etc, the other dealers told me everything from:  "You don't need 4WD, to "With a honda, you don't need low range".
When I informed the Fators salesman what I wanted, he simply showed me the quads that met that criteria and let the quad sell itself.
No BS about other manufacturers, no sales pitch, no pressure.
Excellent Salesmanship!!
As far as service goes, I recently brought my Suzuki Vinson 500 to them for a carburetor issue.  The mechanics, Joe & Duston were very courteous and listened to everything I had to say regarding what led up to the problem.  They had the problem diagnosed in moments and immediately started to work on it.  4 hours later I was driving off with my quad running as well as it ever had.  They overhauled the carburetor and even installed a prefilter in the fuel line to prevent future issues.  They also performed numerous checks and routine maintenance, all at a very reasonable price. The friendly and personable attitude of the Owner and the Mechanics were refreshing and I left a very happy customer.
Great Job Guys!!   Thank You!</Review>

<Time>1600641721258</Time><rate>1< /rate><text>Called to see if they had a shoes in stock. I had to repeat myself several times due to the music being up so loud in the store that they couldn't hear me. Finally he was able to let me know that they had them in stock but put me on hold for 5 seconds and told me they didn't have the size I wanted. So I drove 12 minutes to the store and guess what magically appeared? The shoes that I called about in the size I wanted. BS don't want your time dealing with this location.<//text>< Pictures>

Terrible service, not only do they fail to help you in any way, they get angry at you.
Anything that I asked from the customer service rep, I was only told right away they didn’t have it before they even looked.
Very despotic treatment, and honestly at some point I was essentially getting kicked out even though I hadn’t had any altercation with anybody. I truly don’t understand why management seems to be going out of their way to make the experience as terrible as possible.< /text>

Worst customer service I have experienced.  Lack of customer engagement, lack of professionalism and zero urgency to the customer.  I was so divided that I had to return my purchase as I could not support this business.</review>

They had me waiting more than 20 minutes for a shoe, a girl went to see if they got my size, never came back and they told me absolutely nothing, i had to ask again if the got that shoe and they said it was sold out.
Never coming back, a hundred times better going to the shoe palace at southland, hayward.<//review>

Excellent location to get an awesome tasting Poke bowl and be able to take it to the beach and eat. Enjoyed Sunset on the beach while eating the Classic Shoyu and 51/50. This was the first time I tried spam and it was surprisingly yummy. The food was very good. The strawberry mint lemonade was to die for. The portions were huge even for the small bowl. When in PB you need to try this place.<//text>

A great place for poke, would want to eat again.
Got delivered for lunch. Visually, the color is diverse and vibrant, and I can immediately smell the freshness I expect from a poke bowl.
As a tuna lover who sears tuna steak at least once a week, I can guarantee the tuna is great here. The fish is very fresh and marinated beautifully in the flavorful sauce, definitely the star of the dish. The rice is decent, not too heavily seasoned, and pairs quite well with the spicy fish.
The only minor problem is that the krab salad is rather tasteless, adding soy sauce helps but maybe add some light mayo with the mix could be better. Another suggestion would be to reduce the amount of the seaweed salad, as its sweetness can be a bit overpowering.
Overall a 8.5-9 out of 10, enjoyed it.<//Review>

Amazing food and service! Their poke is super fresh, delicious, and authentic. The nicest chefs you’ll meet will serve up some tasty poke and leave you satisfied. This place is guaranteed to leave you smiling! The portions are filling and generous, and you’ll come back wanting more.</review>

The poke tasted fresh and the flavors were very good. I got the 51/50 bowl, but the spicy ahi was way too spicy for me to enjoy. I would get the garlic poke only next time. I also wish there was slightly more rice so next time I'll ask for more rice and less krab. The seaweed salad was also delicious!<//review>

My first time here and the owner Johnny was super nice, I ended up ordering shoyu poke and spicy ahi with brown rice, crab, seaweed, and ginger I truly enjoyed the flavor , I also got the traditional spam musubi and like the sauce in between the rice and spam, I can’t forget the pineapple Mac salad the tangy from the Mayo snd tart n sweetness from the pineapple, I then washed it all down with my cucumber mint lemonade. I will definitely come back to support :)</text>

I was really happy ordering poke from here! Loved the 51/50 bowl and the spam masubi. I've been searching for a poke place that marinates their fish, and PB Poke House does it 😄 5 stars for the service and 5 stars for the food 🏝🌟</Review>

<Review>Nice little corner eatery.  Owners were super friendly and helpful choosing the right bowl.  The bowls were delicious and the large was a good full meal.  If looking for something besides the standard bar and street taco food that is everywhere on Mission, give PB Poke a try.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><name>Jump Offit</name>< response>

So good! You can’t customize endlessly like some poke shops but what you get is great. 51/50, fuego whatever you get you can’t go wrong. I wish they had more deserts or a few more topping options but that won’t stop me from eating this all the time.</Review>

<rating>3<//rating><review>Staff was friendly but the food wasn’t great. The rice was super dry leaving me reminiscent of a halal food cart and the sauce made the whole experience slimey. Also, this place uses imitation crab. Still got some fish and and it’s conveniently next to the Bach so not all bad.<//review>< pics>

3 stars for quality service, but the food really deserved a 2-2.5. Rice is not sticky, it’s really hard. They used imitation crab instead of real crab. However, the seaweed salad was really good and so was the fuego salmon.<//text>

Such a wonderful hidden gem - got both the 51/50 and spicy Ahi tuna. The fish was super fresh and melted in your mouth and the tastes were on point. Tito was extremely friendly and made the experience even better. Can’t recommend this place more<//review>

Best poke I've had yet! It taste so fresh. I had the spicy garlic and the pineapple mac salad. The poke had a great marinade and had the perfect amount of kick to it. The pineapple with the mac salad, is a sweet twist to a a favorite side dish of mine. The strawberry lemonade was very refreshing, with a hint of mint. This place is just steps away from the beach. I recommend you try it for yourselves!< /Review>

<text>Shabby little corner restaurant with a few tables inside and out. One of the worst poke dishes I've had. Poke was spicy but still managed to be flavorless. Seem to use lots of sriracha (saw them pour it out of a jug) not wasabi which I prefer. Got my husband's and my orders mixed. My spicy order was on his greens and vice versa. To top it off, the two employees got into some sort of disagreement and one stormed out. When we left , he was on the phone at one of the outside tables, swearing his head off. Probably about the other employee. Parking on site, but I think you need to pay. I would suggest another place.</text>< Pictures>

Can't go wrong with the 51/50 bowl.  The flavors for the spicy ahi, spicy garlic ahi, and shoyu ahi are spot on! The ahi itself was fresh cut and amazing. The lemonades are incredible as well. Got the cucumber mint and wanted to take a gallon of it with us to the beach. Best traditional poke place outside of the 808. Excellent service!</review>

A gentle spinning ride that immerses you in bright pastel colors.  Great for young kids.  8 carriages total, 4 adults per carriage.  Each party will get their own carriage however.< /Text>

Makes for a cute ride and the colors at night are really pretty, but I wouldn’t wait longer than 15min to ride it.

This ride used to be Mailboomer, but this is Flik's Flyers, But both Flik and Inside Out are the best rides, but I miss Flik's, Francis, Heimilch, and Tuck and Roll's rides and Flik's show, Is tough to be a bug<//Review>

My kids love this ride but oh my goodness if you get any sort of motion sickness avoid this ride. Sitting in the "backwards seat" is not good. Otherwise it's very cute staying in theme as you ride in little boxes of snacks in Flik's homemade flying contraption.< /review>

<review>A very fun ride for the young ones that older ones can enjoy as well. Always a short line, this is the best way to introduce a child to a small flight in the air. Plus the theme can't be beat. Bug's Land is where it's at.< /review><Time>1482004401576</Time></record>

<Text>The ride is short and not very exciting but it's average fun for little kids.  I liked the creativity in the ride architecture though, like the pie tin, whipped topping container, and raisin boxes, etc.  Really makes you feel like you're a bug!< /Text>< Pictures>

It's your basic ride. The thing goes up and then spins around. The ride feels a little short but it seems great for kids. The line is also much shorter then other rides in the park. It's a nice easy ride.</Text>

This ride was cute and the theming was very good, but we had to wait for quite a while, and the ride was disappointingly short. Also our 2-year-old thought it was pretty boring, but maybe that's just her.</Text>

<review>This gas station is priced lower than the others. That's why I still pick them up to fuel my car. And they have the attendants who are most welcoming. Many thanks!</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) A gas station of the 76 group. The service was polite. The shop is really Mirko. And when I was there, 50% of the columns were definitely defective.

The one helping me name was Vania. They were having conversations about their boyfreinds. They were being so loud. rather than informing me with the company they thought their conversation was more important. Never coming here again. Do not waste your time.</Review>< Name>

<review>We love their service- the more phone lines you have the more discounts you get. They will not let you exchange anything, however. We bought magnetic phone holders for the car that didn't work very well and even tho we had just bought it that day they said no returns or exchanges.<//review>< resp>

Thought about much about posting this. This has been my go to urgent care. Dr Alvarez was rude and impatient at our visit. He didn’t even answer my questions and was very unfriendly. I felt so uncomfortable. The nurse was very friendly and nice, but rest of the staff was not. I will not be returning to this location.< /text>

I am a first time patient with a really bad knee pain and i choose this place because they offer X-ray I came in and didn’t get an X-ray done due to no technician and was told to come back the next day if that was the case they need to advertise  X-rays are only available so and so days because if that was the case I would have went somewhere else.< /Text>

<Review>We went in Sunday afternoon and I was amazed on how fast every thing went. My autistic son was nervous because he needed stitches. The nurses and doctor made him feel safe and comfortable, and we were in and out in 45min. Definitely recommend mcoming here if you want to avoid the nonsense of the ER.< /Review>< response>

I have taken my daughters there a few times. Each and every time they have been professional and kind. The doctors we have seen have been truly amazing. Great bedside manner. I always recommend them. I was injured last year and the doctor was truly surprised and the sympathy and concern he had for me. I will continue to go there.  Highly recommend!!< /text>

I never knew how easy it was to get seen on the same day so fast, no appointment, and pharmacy got necessary prescription immediately same day. Doctor was really calm and understanding, not doubtful of my symptoms, unlike other doctors. Ladies up front were really nice and helpful too.<//Text>

I went in the day of Christmas Eve and was seen promptly. The doctor who saw me diagnosed a chest virus but did prescribe antibiotics and OTC cough syrup. I am visiting from Hawaii and visiting friends so you can understand my misery! I went back to my friends house and curled up in bed and hibernated in their guest room until New Years Eve when I decided I was either dying or I wished I was!

On going back in to the clinic with severe, and obvious, pulmonary distress I was advised to take a seat in the full waiting room. I politely told the desk clerk I was having difficulty breathing and I was informed it was first come first served. After listening to me try to breath (no joke I could NOT breath!) my friend, who had driven me because she didn't trust me to drive as I was, went to the counter and rather coldly told the clerk I could not breathe and I needed to be seen NOW!

I was seen almost immediately after that, lol. The doctor looked at my BP, oxygen levels, and chest sounds (around my coughing fits that left me limp and dizzy) and immediately told me I needed to be seen in the ER and I needed an ambulance and an oxygen bottle. My friend said that was good and she would meet me there. They called the ambulance and stayed with me until they arrived, giving me a breathing treatment while we waited. Turns out I had double pneumonia!

So, to recap, I received excellent service from the doctors and medical personnel. The clerks were polite but rather uncaring on the 2nd visit. Just a recommendation,  if someone says they can't breath BELIEVE them!! Otherwise, I do recommend this location.< /Review>

Usually not too busy, but it happened to be this last time we went because it was a Sunday and it's flu season, so that was expected. They have followed up the last couple of times we've gone with a phone call a couple days later to see how the patient is doing, which was a nice touch.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I went for the first time today because of the earache I arrived at 8:00 pm and they quickly attended to me.
For me all the staff is very friendly.
And they gave me an antibiotic, hopefully it helps me
Tomorrow I'll come back for another one 💉

(Original)
Yo fui por primera vez hoy por causa del dolor de oído llegue a las 8:00 pm  y rápido me atendieron .
Para mi todo el personal es muy amable .
Y me pusieron un antibiótico, ojalá y me ayude
Mañana regreso por otra 💉</Text>

They have a lot of random things like you'd find in a hardware store. Like paint rollers, sandpaper,  razor knives,  crescent wrenches, toilet plunger. And then they have snacks, liquor and Lotto.  Pretty convenient.<//Review>

Has everything you would hope to find in regards to it being a liquor store, and also has some things available that you wouldn't expect, like extension cords and cigars that are actually a good selection for a local liquor spot. Also has some things like BANG energy drinks for a great buy of 2 for $4. And if you enjoy some pistachios or peanuts with your favorite drinks they have some great little zip lock bags with some inside, so just stop by if your a local to silver lakes, it's well worth cutting out the drive outside of here to get very similarly priced things that are offered here without the drive.<//review>

<text>I have been here in the area as a wildland firefighter from Utah. Our team has been staying in multiple cities in the area and we have been utilizing several different laundromats to wash our smoky, ashy clothes. This is definitely the nicest facility we have used thus far. It is conveniently located and very clean compared to others. The prices are reasonable also. I wish we could use this laundromat every time.< /text></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Overall, this is an average laundry.  I found Sunshine Laundry clean, with nice machines, few out of order machines, clean carts with working wheels and casters, average prices, and, well, nothing else.  There is limited seating, no attendant, no restroom, no WiFi, no credit card readers, no vending, small folding tables.</Review>

< review>
Sunshine Laundry is an extremely clean and well maintained place to do laundry. Due to it's location and dedication from the owner it's definitely one of the safest, if not the safest laundromat in Chico. The machines are newer and there's plenty of spots to fold your laundry or have a seat while you wait. The owner is really nice and checks in with customers while he is here. Sunshine laundry is a great place and Chico is lucky to have it around.<//review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>It is clean but I didn't end up staying to do my laundry because he "calls it at eight thirty" so if you have not actually started your laindry by eight thirty at the absolute latest you can get your lazy avss out because the proprietor has got places to go and people to see...yes you will get the mightily disapproving attitude of Sunshine Laundry if youare not in production
BEFORE 839 I myself was 3 minutes late and was made to feel like I was a migjty imposition on the man's social calendar.  One can no longer bring laundry in through the side door, either, because it is "for employees only." He actually said that with a straight face. Um ok sure.I am so not impressed with your non-existent customer service skills. Do you even want customers? It's unclear to me. Never going back there again,< /Text><Time>1476339258279<//Time><userid>100068713810753074573</userid></record>

This is the place to be, after being referred from a good friend I was told to come see Tom. He sure was the man for the job! gave me a good price on a new Alpine stereo installed ready to rock on my Harley Davidson did the job in few hours and called me to come pick up my bike.

Thank you for the great work customer service I will see you again in the future as well as refer friends and family.<//Review>

I just installed JVC in-dash stereo myself, but couldn't figure out how to connect Maestro Universal Steering Wheel control Interface. Stopped by Street Sound Plus and they installed it for me in no time for a reasonable price. Really recommend!  AAA+++ seevice< /Text>

These guys are easy to find. They’re on the corner of reseda and woodley. Overall a really good place. They install all sorts of tech in cars.. from speakers to security systems to breathalyzers. I’ve enjoyed my experience here. Quick and knowledgeable service.</review>

Got my Thinkware F770 2 Channel dash cam installed here on my 2014 Grand Cherokee. The job was done quickly and professionally.

Installation labor was also very affordable.
These guys did a very good job.</Text>

Tom (the owner) is nice as long as you’re lining his pockets by paying for some overpriced work. His employees on the other hand are disrespectful, lazy, and incompetent. Especially the short one with the goat beard and glasses.<//text>

I came back for a receipt to keep for my records, and once again the man with droopy earlobes and an attitude that’s as terrible as it gets told me, “I don’t have to look for it, we will NOT look for it. Please do your best to go anywhere else unless you like terrible service done by a person who doesn’t care about his job</text>

I came in because I wasn't loving the sound of my system (installed myself).  The system was checked out and it ended up just being some random settings creating distortion.  Everything was fixed up and the system sounds great now.  I'm really appreciative of the time they took to check this out for me.</Text>

Tom and Chris are the absolute best in the business, period! After conducting very thorough research, I spoke with the owners of a few car audio shops that proved to be serious about their work. After meeting with Tom, I realized I found the best place to purchase high quality products from and have extremely professional installation performed. Tom and Chris exceeded my lofty expectations and the system is simply fantastic!

Tom and Chris truly care about their product, their reputation, their tremendously clean installations, but most importantly they genuinely care about their customers.  There is no substitute for very professional, pleasant and knowledgeable people who are extremely honest about their business. Tom and Chris take the time to clarify every single aspect of the system you want to put together and have installed.

There was never a time either of these gentlemen pressured me to upgrade any components or accessories. Through the numerous emails and in-person visits, Tom and I discussed what system options were available to me with the budget I had to work with. When discussing my system, Tom and Chris offered options but always allowed every single system decision to be made by me.  Both of these men are very patient, believe me.

I had an entirely new sound system installed, along with a brand new Viper alarm and LED exterior and interior lighting. A custom box was built for my system and the outcome of that was a very pleasant surprise. Tom took the time to customize the box’s beauty cover to my taste and even included a logo and a nickname, all on his own doing! He did not have to take the time to add any of those features but he did so because he felt it helped put the finishing touches on an excellent system that was installed beautifully. Even the sound dampening was installed very cleanly and most importantly, very effectively.

Tom and Chris are very detailed when it comes to ensuring the wiring is very neat, very organized, and aesthetically pleasing. They both took the time to be very detailed with the alarm installation and they both ensured I was completely satisfied with the alarm. Chris even programmed the Viper alarm for me, right down the color of the display on the remote. Both Tom and Chris took the time to walk me through the details of what they were doing and had done, step by step, to allow me to see exactly what was transpiring with my car. They even voluntarily stayed after hours to complete work on my car!

It is very obvious that Tom and Chris take great pride in their work and the results shine through. Lastly, they are very honorable men and that is very important. They both told me directly to my face that if anything arises with the system, contact them, bring the car in and they will take care of it. They are an authorized dealer of excellent products such as JL Audio and Kenwood, among many others. They honor warranties on all products they sell and the installation has an excellent warranty as well.

If you are wanting minor installations or upgrades, or are very serious about your car system, bring your car to Street Sound Plus! They also take care of headlights, taillights, back-up cameras…and many other audio and accessory options. Please, do yourself a favor and stop by Street Sound Plus to appreciate what they do in person.

I will take my car, and any other car I may purchase in the future, to Tom and Chris for any and all work they handle because they have proven themselves. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for ladies and gentlemen. If you do something, have it done correctly and with as good a quality product as possible. I will proudly display the Street Sound Plus stickers on my car and will play my system proudly and loudly to prove and deeply appreciate their work.

Thank you very, very much Tom and Chris. You have made my car even more pleasurable to drive and I like the looks and compliments I receive about the awesome system you gentlemen installed.</review>

<review>I am very disappointed about this place first the installation was draining my battery apparently a short since it was a short the battery burn out I went to get a new still having the same problem the installer told me that nothing wrong with the installation so I took the car to the dealer the dealer advise me that it was the installation so at the end after wasting time and money it was the installation bad connection from the module in too the stereo causing the short and the owner never admitted their fault shame of them, second my Onstar wasn't working they did not connect the cable in to the unit and third it was missing some components in the dash like a rubber and a little nut cover this tells me that the installers are not professional, this is my first and last time in this unprofessional place please don't take your car in this place not trustworthy.<//review>< gmapID>

Quick and efficient service here, I got the coffee cake which was quite nice. The crust is a bit crunchy which is definitely enjoyable and it’s not overwhelmingly sweet.  The coffee is a bit watered down for my liking, I expect cold brew to be a bit stronger.

They do have an outdoor seating area open so it’s a nice place to Chill and just read or talk to a friend. Come out and support local business!<//Text>

The 3 stars rating is there for a reason. Edi is a wonderful guy, straight to the point and true to his word. He will try his best to accommodate you, fair pricing and good workmanship. Overall highly recommended!< /text>

Excellent food and excellent service! The only reason it's not 5/5 is because it can take 40 minutes to get something!!! Expect a long wait on weekends especially.< /Review>

I go here on an almost daily basis! Love the coffee, love the folks who work here. They have GF-friendly sweet options too! Place is very clean and has a well-organized approach to ordering/pick up, etc. My personal favorite is the iced americano!<//Review>

<Review>Went to Jane this morning based on their high reviews. We arrived at 6:55..minutes before opening at 7am.The outside of the cafe was pretty grungy (although staff was trying to clean a bit). The entry way was wet from what looked like garage being brought out through the restaurant. The tables were covered with crumbs and so were some of the seats. I got Avocado Mash, the dish looked great, but tasted okay. The avocado mash tasted like premade guacamole you buy at any supermarket. I asked the staff if they make the avocado mash in house: they said halfway..I'm not sure how to make mashed avocado halfway..but it's definitely not worth $9.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Several gluten free options. The chia parfait is perfection. Hearty toast with toppings make a meal. Yes, waiting in line is worth it.</Text>

I've googled avocado breakfast in San Francisco, Jane on Fillmore  came out from our search. We've decided to head to this cafe for breakfast. There was a consistent queue  in Jane. We've ordered 2 coffee and an avocado toast also a dragon fruit smoothie bowl. This is my first smoothie bowl. It was very fresh, we also had the avocado toast it was very good as well.
Best healthy breakfast place to go to in San Francisco.< /text>

Went in on a Thursday afternoon for a coffee and some cookies to go. Saw a handful of people working and a few others just relaxing. The staff was friendly and helpful. 👍 It's a nice little place with small entrees, good pastries and coffee. If you go for the pastries, plan to be there early as they run out of items later on in the day.<//Review>

<Review>Great coffee delicious food and friendly smiling staff. This place is very busy in the weekends, bit also during the week so don't expect a quite little cafe. It would be great if they switched out some of the metal chairs upstairs with some comfy armchairs, at the moment it is just hard metal chairs I guess to fit in more people.</Review>< pictures>

The vibe in the coffee spot is unlike any other. The music is dope, the staff is great and helps you pick off of your taste buds. The decor is one of a kind and the location is pretty hidden, I would've never guessed it was where it was. I'm not into coffee that much but it's definitely a dope spot to check out.</text>

<time>1579718402312</time><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Sophie Sung< /name><Review>Overrated, slow, and a total miss on the basics. Our lattes took 20 minutes even though there wasn’t a single person in line when we arrived. Both lattes were barely lukewarm because the barista poured each shot of espresso, then paused for a reeaally long involved conversation with a coworker, then steamed the milk for just a handful of seconds before pouring it. Definitely not worth $10.

We’d heard this spot is known for its baked goods but our pumpkin bread was super dry and disappointing — we actually saw another customer return her slice and ask for a different pastry because it was so dry.

Not sure what all the fuss is over this spot: seems like serving lattes that are actually hot and pastries that aren’t dry as sawdust shouldn’t be too tough of a bar to meet.<//Review><rating>2< /rating><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

Coffee was just great- the cups are also really pretty. I remember accidentally coming here both times I was waiting in line for a table at Brenda's. They serve charcoal lattes here in case you need a Sunday morning cleanse after a night out. Overall it's a great place to have lunch or brunch! (It was also very busy on a Friday afternoon when I took a day off from work to study for my licensing exam.)< /text>

<text>While looking for a light salad place and a cup of tea on a late Sunday afternoon, my friend and I walked along  Fillmore, passing  empty fancy places until we stumbled into packed Jane. One glance at the menu and we knew we found it.  There were only two tiny seating spots left upstairs and those had a colorful view down into the bakery counter and the rest of the lively scene.  Lots of young people with their laptops, a good sign.  The Asian Chicken Salad with sesame dressing was super fresh and delicious and the service good and friendly.  Planning to come back.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The place is good, staff is not kind. I ordered coffee at 530pm. The store was closing in 15 minutes and they didn’t tell me anything. I pointed out this point to a clerk and she never apologized. I had to leave half way coffee. Felt rushed.</Review>

Great cafe on Fillmore to get coffee, breakfast or lunch. They have a large salad menu, with lots of different options. The cookies are also delicious. There is often a long line, because your order at the counter and service isn’t particularly fast. If the overall service improved, this would easily be 5 stars given the quality and price of the food and drinks.< /review>

Although the sour dough bread was a bit too thick for my liking, everything else about their interpretation of the avocado toast was excellent. It comes with an egg (I recommend getting it soft boiled), jalapenos, and onions. I would definitely order this dish again.

The staff is also very kind and helpful. Make sure to come early though, this place can get very crowded as it is very popular!</Review>< user>

Fantastic, fresh food in Lower Pac Heights. Go for brunch or lunch or sip on a cappuccino and get some work done. Their salads are delicious and so are their berry bowls—you can’t go wrong here!</Text>

It is very trendy here and it is almost always busy. Whether you're waiting for take out or waiting for a table you will be waiting for quite a while as despite the staff moving about at lightning speeds it is just really popular.

Is it worth the wait?

Yes. The food is delicious and the coffee is pretty great too. If you manage to snag a window seat it's a great place to people watch too.< /text>

Love this place.  Jane makes an amazing almond milk latte.  They also make a delicious espresso.  And, if you have a sweet tooth, their "Crazy Cookie" is really, really good.  The cinnamon rolls are just fabulous.  And, if you want to eat healthy, their granola and also their green smoothies are pretty darn good.<//text>

<review>Fantastic cafe! They do consistently excellent lattes and have great pastry options. The bread they bake is also delicious (try their walnut and fig loaf, for example). Given the quality, the place understandably gets super popular at peak times. Great ambiance, good mix of people hanging out chatting and others working.</review></record></dataset><record>

Probably my favorite place to have a bite in Pacific Heights. Good prices and great food. Nothing fancy just delicious salads and sandwiches as well as great lattes. Always busy but people do move in and out quickly so you should be able to get a seat even though.</Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>When you first glance inside the lovely windows and doors of Jane on Fillmore, you're met with some pleasant decor and a bustling vibe full of many guests dining away, an impressive 1st impression that unfortunately ends as soon as you walk through the doors.

Right upon entry, this wave of heat straight out of the sahara desert engulfs every inch of your body, making you feel like a young high school wrestler trapped inside of a steaming hot sauna trying to cut weight for a competition tomorrow.

After peeling off every acceptable layer of clothing possible and navigating my order through heat stroke like conditions (Me - Turkey Club Sandwhich; My GF - Avocado Mash), I eagerly awaited the reprieve I would feel once I finally received the delicious brunch food that I was promised through the many positive reviews online.

Unfortunately, my saga did not contain the Cinderella ending that I so desperately hoped for.  While waiting for my food to be finished, I couldn't help but watch all the hard working chefs bustling meticulously away while preparing every dish inside of their open kitchen next to the dining area.

My curiosity indeed killed the cat (or in this case my appetite), watching them create a standard avocado toast consisted of them pulling out a large industrial sized tub of guac that looked like it was purchased from costco, slathering an ungodly amount onto multiple pieces of toast, followed by pre-made already peeled hard boiled eggs also from a tub.  It felt like if McDonald's ever served avocado toast, this would be the conveyor belt method that they would enforce, hardly the expected amount of personalization or individually cut avocado from actual avocados that a $9  price tag should warrant.

Our fears were confirmed when we actually started consuming our food. The egg and guac mash were indeed cold and bland as expected.  My turkey club sandwich was PACKED with 2 small slices of turkey and tasted no better than the sandwiches that anyone could make from the comfort of their own home.

The only saving grace was the magnificent and diverse staff/chefs, who were nice, social, efficient, and must all have some type of reptile blood inside of them to be able to withstand the constant amount of ubiquitous heat on a daily basis.  Props to you guys.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I was very excited to try their pastries. I have heard very good things about their quality. The reason I'm giving two stars is due to staff. The server that provided me with my coffee was not in a pleasant mood, I asked where the sugar and milk was located & received a snarky remark as to it's location. When I received my avocado toast, it was just tossed on my table. I believe the staff would benefit from a customer service class.</text>

I could have sworn I wrote a review for this months ago, especially having dropped in at least three times by now! In any case, despite all the visits, I've only ever come in to try their pastries, and none of their hot foods. By now, I've had two of their coffee cakes, one of their regular cakes, one of their cookies, and most recently, their scones.

And, honestly? Not all that impressed. Good bakery items, but nothing phenomenal. Their coffee cakes are much tastier than their regular cakes, and their scones are pretty solid too, but you can also find better of the various individual items elsewhere in the city.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - Jane is a pretty compact venue, with some limited (but accessible) two tops up front, higher (and less accessible) bar height two tops towards the side, and a second floor with some other sort of seating. The ordering counter and the bar two tops end up forming a slightly narrow corridor, that's somewhat difficult to navigate when the place is packed (which is most of the time), but nothing a couple "pardon me"s can't fix. As for ordering itself, I recall the counter being a tad on the high side, which makes it a little harder to see all the pastries they have on display.

Bathroom - No comment because I didn't try them.< /text>

<review>I really like this place, they have an interesting selection of yummy pastries (i think the cookie we got was called the crazy cookie), and good coffee. Super crowded, though, and really no place to sit which is a bummer (barely space to even stand in line). The upstairs is also a bit hipstery with the graffiti.

But if you're in SF for something or are in the Fillmore, definitely worth a stop.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

They're known for their baked goods, but they also make a mean Niçoise salad! Not a huge fan of their drip coffee but it does have free refills if you're a caffeine addict like me. Standing in line for a little bit is well worth the meal.< /text>

Food was good but wait was almost 30 minutes for our food. They obviously forgot our order and rushed out the food without a properly cooked egg (no runny yoke). It is also interesting that we had to wait in line again to get the cookies we ordered and they wouldn't bring it to us when we asked at our table.</Review>

They make from scratch a somewhat yummy green smoothie (my favorite), serve four barrel coffee, have upstairs seating, and bar seating (so you can eat alone and enjoy your lunch without feeling lame).
What’s to like?!: The vintage/art deco décor of the place. The soup & sandwich combos for $11. They make amazing soups and bake some incredible house made baked goods. I particularly love their cookies.
To dislike?!: Not much to dislike here, only a lot to love.</Review>

I absolutely love the atmosphere here! It has the feel of a modern, young, hip, coffee shop/ breakfast place.  My favorite is the egg sandwich which serves as the perfect quick meal or even breakfast on the go.  I often come here for a small bite, a cup of joe and to do about an hour of work and this place has all the angles covered.  I have also had the cinnamon roll here (I highly suggest that you ask them to heat up the roll, as it is 10x better that way).  This is my favorite breakfast place on Filmore for all the reason listed above in addition to the great staff!<//Text>

Constantly bustling with hip young professionals, Jane is a spectacular brunch and lunch place! The quinoa bread is remarkable and rather filling but not in a unhealthy way. I usually go with the egg sandwich though I wish there were more egg options that were not bread heavy. All in all, I would go back every weekend if I could. And the coffee is top notch too!< /Review>

Orange juice, poured from a jug bought at a grocery store, should not cost $4. Maybe if they had squeezed the oranges themselves. Maybe if they grew the oranges in their backyard. Maybe if they weren't obvious about pouring the store bought orange juice in front of you just to make it clear that you are paying way more than you should be. On this point alone, I refuse to be a patron.<//review>

Both the coffee and the food are excellent if you're willing to brave the long line that's usually there. It can be difficult to hear what the person next to  you is saying, let alone hearing when your order is ready. Highly recommend ordering to go and hanging out at Alta park nearby to avoid the pretentious atmosphere.< /Review>

The egg white sandwhich, banana bread (regular, gluten free), granola/seeds bar, various out muffins, green smoothie (optional banana, ginger for 50 cents), and coffees (+variety of milks) are not to be missed! Additional seating is available upstairs.<//Review>< pics>

Awesome cinnamon bun if you can get there early enough on the weekend but they do sell out fast. I've seen them set aside buns before for call-ins while I'm in line, not cool.  Personally I don't love the Stumptown coffee.</text>

Very good coffee and pastries and sandwiches are good. A lot of healthy options on the menu. Too bad its self service and if you will buy more items than a simple drink, don't expect them to land on your table all at the same time.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This place has a special place in my heart. I love the name, I love the vibe (inviting but edgy-- how do they do that?!), and I LOVE the pastries and stuff coming out of these guys' kitchen. Whether you are tucking into an email reply-a-thon (note: the prime tables are reserved for cafe customers and not remote workers-- genius!), or coming to Jane with your family and friends, you'll feel welcome, stylish, and probably pretty hip. A lot of people would compare this place to The Mill, but that's in a different neighborhood. For me, I'm glad we've got our Jane. Make sure to get something on the bread that they make at their Mission location- it's absolutely divine.< /Review>< pictures>

The croissants, the kouign amann and bread are all outstanding. Can't beat the chocolate chip cookie. Or the ginger cookie. Or the oatmeal white chocolate. But then, when you have to eat real food? I love the Cobb salad, and I love the curry chicken salad sandwich. You can't go wrong here at all.< /review>

This is a cute cafe that's nice to hang out in. It gets pretty busy on the weekend, but if you're just grabbing a to-go item, it's a great place to stop by. I love the Chai latte with soy milk and their selection of pastries. My favorite is the chocolate chip cookie and
pound cake!<//Review>

They make the best mochas here! It’s unfortunately super crowded and it got worse over the past year. They have a few good vegan food options, specifically the smoothie bowls and the warm quinoa bowl. They also have salads if you’re into that. And they make some vegan cookies that are good, I wish they had more variety of those! I used to love their white chocolate chip cookie that has salt on it but that one’s not vegan. The workers are super friendly and always remember my order, even though they get so many customers!</text>

Their gluten-free baked goods are really full of flavor! If you have Celiac Disease, the toast might not be a good idea because of the cross-contamination in the toaster. I suggest warming it up at your home to be extra safe.< /text>

Fab! And delicious gluten free options available! Varies daily, but the gf banana bead and chocolate chip cookie are most excellent.

Not a TON of places to sit, but the bar is great whether with a friend to chat or by yourself.

Super friendly staff, the Golden Monkey tea is superb, and the atmosphere is lovely.

And best of all, it's not chain-brand Sbucks junk.<//text>

Terrible service, no seating. The food was decent but took 20 minutes of waiting in line and then there was no place to sit; they should make more of an effort to find dine-in patrons tables. When we found a table 35 minutes later, nobody came to wipe it down. Coffee was never delivered to table despite Barista saying it would be. Will not go back mostly because of awful logistics and inability to get seats.<//text>

Nice little place with good looking food and coffee. However, the washroom is too close to the prep area for cold non cooked foods like granola and yogurt, salads etc.  You can smell the washroom from the coffee bar which is double the distance away. I got some type of stomach bug from here.  Bloated for 2 days, broke out in hives for over a week and now allergic to milk products.  I'm sure it's this place since my wife and 6 year old son ate and drank the same thing as I did for a week before and a week after.  The only thing they didn't eat was the from this place. The same day after eating from here I got sick.<//Review>

<review>Muffin?! Did someone say muffin? My search for the cities best muffin has taken me to Jane. The bird seed muffin will fulfill any muffin-lovers dream.
Jane is a trendy, urban cafe designed for people to meet, work and eat. The upstairs seating is a worker's paradise (except for the noise from the kitchen - you won't want to take calls from here).
Downstairs is a hustle of city people enjoying their bowls of berries, freshly baked pastries, or healthy salads with ingredients you would never think go together. Highly recommend. A wonderful place. Coffee is made with love. Free wi-fi for all.<//review>< Pictures>

Croissant baked to perfection and skillfully made cappuccino, however the quality of the coffee was a bit too sour.

I ordered a black rice porridge which used Goji  berries and chia seeds, both thrown dry on top, instead of being rehydrated as they should, making me think they care more about fashionable ingredients than the way to employ them.

Overall it was good, but there is room for improvement.< /Text>

We had homemade Chai here - the best I had in a long time, as it was not too sweet (like most) but really nice and spicy. We also tried the Cuban Cortadito - which was lovely and the Mocha. Also a winner.< /text>

You'll be hard-pressed to find seating and there's always a line, but coffee and tea aficionados in the neighborhood may find that it's worth it. Baristas use beakers and machines on seasonal beans and leaves to make the perfect cup for every preference. Pair your cup with one of their filling quiches or sweet treats, then go upstairs to see if you can snag one of the cushy seats. There's free wifi but outlets are hard to find if you come to work.</review>< Resp>

It's debatable what's Jane's "other" location: the one on Larkin or my to-go spot, the Fillmore Jane's. What's not debatable: you'll get quality coffee, delicious food, all in a lively PacHeights setting. With San Francisco prices. Salad = $9, Banana bread = $3, Chai Latte = $4.

Well, you'll forget about what you just paid once you take a sip of their home-made Chai, or munch on their fresh and tasty granola.

Very very busy, and it'll be hard to find seating any time of day. But: busy for a reason.<//Review>

I’m embarrassed to say that even though I’ve been to Portland, I’ve never had their famous Stumptown coffee. When I discovered that Jane on Fillmore served it, I headed down there. I was sorely disappointed because there was a strong acidic note that left a sour after taste. If you want Stumptown, get the bottled cold brewed coffee.

I ordered the coffee cake with raspberries. It’s exactly what you expect when you pick up a coffee cake at CostCo – a bar above decent. I’m not shitting on CostCo’s baked goods, I’m just saying that Jane’s isn’t something to rave about.

I also ordered the tuna melt. It came with yellow cheddar, tomatoes, and while the tuna had a nice peppery bite, but there was too much mayo. I hate it when watery mayo seeps through the delicious buttery toasted bread and makes it soggy. Other than that, it was decent.< /text>

(Translated by Google) If you are nearby, be sure to try brunch early in the morning. Although it is in the neighborhood, the quality salad and avocado toast are convenient and cost-effective. You can enjoy the relaxing mornings of locals. The cashier male staff are also very friendly.

근처에 잇다면 꼭 아침 일찍 브런치를 먹어보길. 동네에 있지만 수준급 샐러드와 아보카도 토스트가 핸찮고 가성비 굿. 현지인들의 여유로운 아침을 구경할 수 있다. 캐셔 남자직원도 참 친절.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Spicy Baked Eggs, reassuring in the cold morning weather. The line was long from 9 o'clock, so I entered the place. I didn't have a lot, so it was okay for breakfast.

(Translated by Google) I had a sandwich at lunch. Tuna sandwich soup set and hot coffee.
The soup is probably a bean potage. The taste is ethnic and delicious. The sandwich had bread toast and it was very delicious and delicious.
However, even though the store is small and seats are not available, there are too many visitors. It's hard to go right and left in the store to secure seats. I want you to improve that area.

(Original)
お昼にサンドイッチを頂きました。ツナサンドのスープセットと、ホットコーヒー。
スープはたぶんお豆のポタージュ。エスニックぽい味で美味しい。サンドイッチもパンがトーストしてありとても香ばしくっておいしかったです。
ただ、お店が狭く座席があっまりないのに、来客が多すぎ。座席を確保するのにお店の中で右往左往して大変です。その辺りを改善してほしい。<//text>
