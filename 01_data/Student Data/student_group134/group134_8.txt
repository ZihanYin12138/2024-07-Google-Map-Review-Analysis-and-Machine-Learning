<Review>We ordered our food, 3 burgers 1 fry, at 1:55pm. The cashier immediately flipped the screen around and asked for a tip. For what? For taking our order? Do they not get paid? I mean, I understand tipping at a restaurant where you are seated, drinks are brought out to you, you know? Service? But what am I tipping for? Do gas pumps ask for a tip? Does the walmart cashier ask for a tip? Does In-N-Out ask for a tip? I am all for tipping, but immediately after you place your order?
The place was not busy at all, there were no orders ahead of us. One guy was working the grill while the cashier dude was on his cell phone. 20 minutes later at 2:15 I walked up and asked if everything was okay, the cashier guy said that a big "Uber Eats" order came in and those have priority and that our food would be out shortly.
I don't mind spending $4.75 on a burger, but by no means was what we received $4.75 burgers. They were not even warm, asked for "no catsup" came with catsup anyway. And I was not expecting the "Little Big Burger" to be quite as "Little" as it was.
I cant imagine a place like this staying in business for long. I'm sure enough people's curiosity has kept a steady flow of customers up until this point, but with prices, product, and service at the level of what I experienced, I doubt they get many return visitors.

Edit: I guess I was right. "Permanently Closed". 🤷‍♂️</Review><Response>None</Response><Name>Jesse B</Name><GmapID>0x80d959ceaaaaaaab:0xeb37070f5642b02a</GmapID><user>104391482514180957365</user><rating>1< /rating></record>

<Text>Today was my first day eating here and it was the best experience. The customer service was perfect and very friendly, asking for every detail on how to make your burger so it is the best burger you have. The price here is very reasonable and the combo is also reasonable because the food here is great quality so you get your money's worth. The condiments here is very special having a little kick of heat to them, but not to much to not like them. The burger tasted amazing and the fries were like no other fries I have had. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants to sit down and just have a great meal.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80d959ceaaaaaaab:0xeb37070f5642b02a</gmapID></record>

<username>Alyssa Elkins< /username><text>The first time visiting Little Big Burger I was attracted by how you can see the person cooking your food like how In and Out does. The staff is super friendly and helped me figure out what kind of burger I wanted by saying how they cook their burgers to what condiments you want on it. The price may be expensive to some, but their quality for their burgers and fries are amazing so much better than big burgers at fast food restaurants. Even their sauces are awesome as they are not traditional sauces restaurants have like their ketchup is not the regular Heinz but a ketchup with chili peppers to give it a little kick. I totally recommend this restaurants to all my friends because this place is amazing and I can't wait to come back again.</text>< Date>

Bomb burgers for a good deal. You can’t go wrong here.   I don’t know why anyone would spend more money on a   Fast food burger meal  made from who know what from the typical fast food restaurants like Carl’s,McDs, or Jacks when you can get a real burger with real bacon and fresh veggies, truffle fries and a stick for like 9 bucks  From this place.  Every bit as quality and tasty as the burger lounge.< /text>

It's simple and the burgers are small, but pretty good. I unfortunately ended up finding a hair on my burger. I knew oit wasn't mine or any of the cooks because it was long! It was kinda funny how the reaction on all of faces trying to figure out where this hair came from. But the staff was awesome and extremely kind and where more then happy to make another burger for me. I was fortunate enough to have a pleasant experience out of something unpleasant.</Text>

Great burgers made to order fresh. Fries are large enough to share. There was a problem with the drink machine so the guy gave us coupons to come back even though he fixed the machine. Great service and food.< /Review>

Very tasty, truffle fries are unique. BUT watch for chili pepper in the ketchup they put on their burgers. I have a family member who has serious allergic reactions to pepper in general (systemic, not sneezing). This same ketchup is apparently also served at their tables and also mixed into their fry sauce. For most people this isn't going to be a problem but if it is then watch out.
I'll go back but it will have to be on my own.
Three stars for really tasty food but a ruined afternoon over ketchup that I only realized contained chili pepper after examining the bottles at the tables.<//review>

< Review>
You can tell the burgers were probably hand formed pattied and they did taste fresh. The buns were very greasy, however, and their fries are overpriced and overhyped. When they opened, they had a guy offering samples of their truffle fries, which are the obly fries featured on the menu- and they were good at that point. Having actually paid money for them the second time, I felt like they were normal fries and they weren't worth the cost.
Also, my partner had asked for bacon on his burger, and I didn't, but they ended up putting it on both anyway. And I know what you're thinking- why complain about bacon? It was dry and pretty much overcooked and it ruined the texture of the burger. So there's that.<//Review>

<Text>Clean, always an open stall (so no waiting in line which is a huge plus), vacuums, change machine, etc. Basically, it has everything you'd expect to find in a typical no-frills car wash. Also, the location is very convenient for me.</Text>< response>

My first visit to Brickhouse was years ago, but it is still a vivid picture in my mind. I was greeted warmly by the owner, Barbara and others that were assisting her. We enjoyed some home-cooked Southern cuisine and beverages, including wine, and enjoyed a night of scheduled activities throughout the Chitlin Circuit series. I have been on several occasions, including the series, and each time there was beautiful art work to take in from local artists and inspiring, thought-provoking words shared by the talented poets that graced the mic. All are welcomed. Love flows freely to and through each person that walks through the door. The atmosphere is wonderful.</review>

I went to the Brick House Gallery to listen to music. My professor and his band played there. It was pleasant and entertaining, the owner supplied food and drinks at no charge, it was all about visiting Vintage Oak Park. I had a good time and I will be going back to the Brickhouse Gallery.< /Review>

The owner/manager is great to work with. The facility has a great sound system and seating for 100-125. The courtyard in the back has lots of possibilities for a great function.< /review>

The management is warm and friendly, willing to listen and answer questions. I have lived in this park over 13 years. The rules that we should abide to are for everyone’s benefit. Especially ours! That is what sets Cordova at the top of the list in my opinion. I am thrilled that they are monitoring cars parked on the streets. People need to understand the necessity and not complain. In an rmergency,since our streets are narrower than a typical residential area of homes,,emergency crews need to have easy access to help us. While nothing is ever perfect, Cordova staff has always been gracious and addressed my concerns. Thank you!< /review>

Im a resident.They dont deserve a star at all.They are horrible. They pick and choose rules for different people.You are not able to live comfortably, if you don't like HOA DON'T MOVE HERE. They are worse. The staff in the management office are the most horrible thing about Cordova especially Julie. She yells at residents,  she is unfair with applying the rules. In closing I want to move,you will not be happy here. If you think buying a home means freedom again not here,they control everything about your house and around it and if you let them in your home they will try in there also.<//text>

So many hidden gem here in Sacramento and this is one of them. A tiny little place with big taste and very affordable prices. Street taco's for .99cent!! Whaaaaat!! You can't beat that! Very friendly staff and very clean inside. They also have ice cream and various fruity drinks. I highly recommend this great little place.</Text>

Got a super burrito and it was amazing. The asada is tender and chopped up small. Food was fresh and the service was great! Would definitely come here again.</Review>

<review>Lots of mexican food places on Fulton. This one is the best. You can taste the quality. Burritos are always mixed well( never get a mouthful of just rice or sour cream). It's a must-try place for sure!! I'll be back this weekend!</review><GmapID>0x809ad982caa55fb5:0x96548d1fd3ea9692<//GmapID>< userid>

3 stars for service and cleanliness. Food is average. Wouldn't eat here anymore myself, but its the closest Mexican food to me so when I buy for my coworkers this is where I go.< /Review>

Amazing. Best little secret Mexican food spot. If you want amazing street tacos. This is your go to. The chili relleno is off the hook..the tacos pastor are delish. Everything is so good and consistently good that's key. 👌</review>

Took the recommendation from Google maps and we, my family of four, were not disappointed. All of the food was fresh and hot. Salsa bar was varied and delicious. Could be cleaner, but if you’re coming for the food, don’t hesitate!</Text>

<date>1576631057460<//date><rating>5<//rating><review>99 cent tacos. For dollar tacos, these are a great value and tasty. I tried 4 tacos here and the staff were also cheerful and welcoming.
1.Chorizo- my favorite of the four. Crispy and soft chorizo. A mild to medium spiciness. Packed with flavor and needs no salsa.
2. Carnitas- Crispy traditional pork carnitas that go well with salsa verde.
3. Asada- Ok for the price but a little drier and lacked strong marinated flavor. For 99 cents, its still a good deal.
4. Pollo- Not dry and nicely flavoured.  Also great with salsa verde or roja.

Still many more meats to choose from but 99 cents per taco is awesome.  Nice small taqueria that I'll definitely be going back to try again.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtshGL598RTALCq22lL24trTJabR76VQyIOZZT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNugGtAIg5T5u1eNW89AYsngfd6TP5vVyxsjLrZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrCPU2XevuzQCbkix9dnag26Oh0elLU5EUx9Uk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<username>Michael Camarillo< /username><Review>Tacos are good, they are usually the only things I get. Prices just went up 50 cents though which kinda sucks. Rice and beans have no flavor. Dont ever get the Nachos. Well if u like gas station cheese then go ahead. Just stick to the tacos.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

No other place is coming close to them in the area! Great prices, I'm here at least 3 times a week, they take custom orders and call in for large party orders ahead of time, awesome staff and THE best menu with dishes you can't get at other places, HIGHLY recommended if in the need of REAL Mexican! 5+ stars, if anyone says anything negative about this place, they can go to Taco Bell and let them screw up the order, never happens here!😂😂😎, get to Los Nopales fast!💣💣🔥🔥💯🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹< /Review>

<review>I usually eat here about once a week, i ordered the Torta (Sandwich) with Carnitas and mayonnaise and sour cream on side. I got a sandwich with old, dry meat that was 😝 gross. And they put the mayo and sour cream on the sandwich not on the side and globbed it on. Disappointing, food quality of food is going downhill, 😝. I have been eating here for years now, time to stop now.</review><Time>1582942977377<//Time>< Gmap_id>

One of those hole in the wall places that is easy to drive past, lost in the sea of used car lots, however I cannot recommend this place highly enough!  Great value (99 cent tacos!) for great quality and definitely authentic as it gets for Sacramento!</Text>

<review>Great place to grab a quick lunch! They beat everyone in the area as far as the food goes. Th serving are bigger and the prices are cheap! My gontonmeals are the Carne Asada plate. It’s worth every penny and you get tons of food. Two people can eat from one serving. The rolled Tacos are great and Friday, Sat and Sunday they have Menudo with all the fixings and hand made tortillas!! You can’t beat that. Oh yeah! $.99 tacos everyday not just Tuesday’s like every other spot!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1533966095604, 'text': 'Thank you Eder rubio you are welcome any time we are ready to serve you ...'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

I have had nothing but the best experience since becoming a member.  Each representative I have dealt with, especially my Agent Michelle Pappe have been efficient, courteous, responsive and very helpful.  The amount I pay each month is also a plus because it is very very affordable.  This tells me that they care about me, my needs in insuring my automobiles and renters insurance, especially and most importantly the financial part of it.  I am definitely getting way more than what I pay for and for that, I am a very satisfied customer.  Thank you  Michelle and your insurance representatives for making me feel special.  Member for life, for sure!< /Text>

<text>Michelle is extraordinarily compassionate, knowledgeable and detailed-oriented. When my 40 foot elm tree fell on my home, she had the tree guys out there within an hour - the tree carted away before my kids came home so they didn’t have to witness the scary sight. She makes sure you are adequately insured, so when disaster happens, you’re covered! She is awesome!</text>< time>

<review>Michelle Pappe is the best! She's been helping us for years and has taken great care of us every time we needed help. We have multiple types of insurance under her care and agency, and we keep adding on more because we love her exceptional service. She is quick to respond, personable, always tells us our options and is not afraid to research things for us when needed. She always strives to provide us the best quotes and services. She helps drain the stress out of the insurance process when you need to use it. Finding Michelle as an insurance agent is like finding a good doctor, you want to keep her for life! ❤️❤️❤️<//review>< user_id>

Michelle Pappe is the best insurance agent I have had.  After years with AAA I am so glad I made the switch to Allstate, but in particular, that Michelle is my agent.  She is attentive, knowledgeable, and is constantly checking in to see if I have any outstanding needs or changes.<//text>

<Text>Michelle went above and beyond to help us find home insurance for a home we were in the process of purchasing. The home is in a fire zone and so not many insurers would provide coverage. She presented us with several options and explained what the differences were as well as a recommendation. She kept us updated on the status of obtaining a policy since we needed one as a condition of the mortgage. I would highly recommend Michelle for all of your insurance needs.</Text>< username>

Ms. Pappe is very good with return calls/emails and gives all the information that is needed in an accurate and timely way. She is extremely personable and the customer knows they and their needs are cared about. In an age where you sit on hold with menus that you can't navigate, Ms. Pappe is a breath of fresh air.< /review>

<text>Professional staff and courteous service.

Michelle is the absolute best Insurance Agent I have ever dealt with, honest, to the point and finds me the best outcome every time.
I was new to the USA in 2012 and totally confused, by 2018 I have been through about 4 agents, Michelle, and Allstate are now my only go to agency.   Highly Recommended for sure.< /text>

Allstate turned out to not be a right fit for my situation, but Michelle took the time to discuss and walk me through my options (even with other providers), far beyond what I could have expected. Will return here when the time is right, knowing I'll get the best service.< /text>

Padre Bill Barman is my favorite. There is a private elementary school, and many activities throughout the year. Architecture is modern/traditional. Can't go wrong going here.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Hi. La purisima.It is a clean place.No noise is heard, it has a beautiful view towards the cetritos,, it is a place that inspires spiritual peace ... It is a beautiful place and temple to meet, it has benches in the atrium that invite you to rest . I recommend this place to visit and to coexist in many of the activities and programs that they have there at different times of the year ....

<Text>Easy to get to?
Yes! It’s right on the street!

We’re the staff nice?
They were very nice!

How was the price?
Good. It was pretty cheap and the sculpture of a bird I got was only 9 bucks.

Anything worthwhile near?
Yep. It’s right next to bampfa and there’s lots to do around.

Is it safe to go during COVID?
I’d say yes. Everyone wore a mask and the store is absolutely huge.

How was it overall?
A good experience overall. It’s a nice atmosphere and there’s plenty of stuff to sit on (obviously)

Lots of stairs! It's an older facility that use to be a bank. They did what they could with the space but I think some plants would have helped love up the place.<//review>

< Review>
I like their designs and their quality is good. I own four of their pieces currently. Their service on the other hand has been very disappointing. I’m still waiting for one item which has been back ordered for a long time. They have given me several estimated dates of delivery that have come and gone maybe 5-6 times most without notice or a call from them. I’ve been told “it’s in the port” and waiting to be unloaded and then later been told “it’s on the ship.” I’m approaching 4 months since my pre-paid order. When I politely asked for a discount given all the delays, I was told they would have to contact their manager. No one followed up with me as usual. When I called back after the next estimated delivery passed, I was told the manager said they would Not offer a discount because they had done nothing wrong. If poor service and constantly missed delivery times with little outreach or notifications is doing your job well, I guess they are right. This will likely be my last piece bought from Scandinavian Designs.

Update: Shortly after posting this review I got an email from a manager who offered me their floor model or a small discount on my order which was a nice gesture. It would have been great if the service happened earlier but I appreciate the effort to make the situation better so I gave them an extra star. In the end, our piece arrived after about four months of waiting and we do love it.< /Review>

Good quality furniture. Neutral tones easy to dress up or dress down, depending on your taste. The store can be a bit busy so be prepared to wait for assistance. But the assistance (once you get it) is patient and thorough. Delivery guys are terrific, too. I plan to return!</Review><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>I bought here a bed frame. The selection of furniture is great, with a lot of very nice pieces, although a bit expensive. However some offers are often present and could be the best time for a good quality purchase.
Editing the review after I looked for a sofa as well. Staff was really not too helpful, we were not sure the sofa would fit our room and the dimensions of the one they had in the store did not match the ones advertised, but did not help much in figuring out what we would really get. In general it felt like they did not know what they were selling and mostly redirected us to another location of their store.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Came in with my friend who was ready to drop over $3k on a new bedroom set that he painstakingly researched and had already decided on, but the staff was SO RUDE we left without buying anything.< /text>

Don't bother going to this location, go to the Concord store where they have everything.  Pretty much what the sales people told us also.</Text>

< Review>
I had ordered for an office desk to be delivered and assembled, the delivery guy gave us a 3 hour window and told he will call 30 minutes before he came, he never called before he reached, was at the doorstep expecting people to open the door waiting for him when he rings the bell, very rude, totally illiterate, no idea of what he is doing. Will never again order from them unless they change the delivery company.<//Review>

<review>Absolutely Awful.  A piece of a sectional that did not attach was delivered to me.  Had to fight tooth and nail to get them to just get the same story about what could be done to replace the sectional or get it fixed.  Every time I spoke with them ,it was something different.  One expects a little beetter for dropping close to $2K on a couch!<//review>< Resp>

We are recent residents of this community and have been very pleased with our choice. Moving in was stress free. As with every move in experience, there were small issues that needed to be fixed.

Putting in a maintenance request is simple. I am more impressed with the quick turn around in getting service. I would recommend this community for anyone who is looking for a quiet, safe and pleasant place to live.<//Text>

<Text>I am a new resident and love everything about this place! The young gentlemen Alfonso is pleasant and very welcoming, Roman was extremely organized and made the move in process simple and easy for someone my age. The ambience of the office sets the tone throughout with lovely decor and the wonderful spa and garden area. I feel safe with all the security cameras and bright lights throughout.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I am a resident that’s lived here for over 10 years  and I can honestly say this building is the best! Roman & Alfonso are amazing and work extremely hard to keep it clean and safe. Since Roman came here there has been a much change for the better.

Hayward Village Apartments has a new manager name Roman.  He’s very nice and professional.  The building is well kept, and I was there when the guys were planting fresh new flowers out front, making sure the building’s well maintained.  Surely a wonderful place to live.  Thanks Roman, and keep up the great work. Two thumbs up!</review>

Hayward village Senior Apartments is incredibly accommodating and helpful to navigating tha application process to qualifying for residency and reassuring family's decision that the senior will be in a place they call home is safe and friendly.
The site manager, Ramon, was encouraging,  patient, and knowledgeable on the system to complete the application and getting documents required.  He also took the time to engage bother myself and my sister to assess her needs to see if it would be a fit for her needs.  I felt his extra time and care allowed my sister the comfort to make this transition.
While in the lobby office area, many residents flowed through greeting us and wishing us good luck.  They all talked of their positive experiences of their well cared for apartments, the friendly staff, especially Ramon and the maintenance staff,  and the facility indoor and outdoor areas.  This made my sister relaxed and smiled .  She knew she would be moving to a great community not just a small room feeling alone.< /Review>

I am a new applicant at Hayward Village. The environment is clean Roman the manager was helpful. Ed the financial manager was patient and spent lots of time with me getting through the application process. All the tenants seem friendly. It appears to be a safe place to live close to transportation and places to eat.</text>

It's difficult to find a senior apartment in a modern building with gated off-street parking. Hayward Village checks those boxes. The new manager appears to be working overtime to make it better. He seems to be affable and capable; a promising combination. Proximity to 880 makes it a breeze to get places and the building is in the delivery zone for most major retailers.<//review>

The overall maintenance of the building has improved since Roman has been on property.  My personal relationship with the manager is good.</text>

<text>We have a new manager!!!! Time has flown by  since our new manager, Roman, came aboard but I want to say this is one of the best upgrades to our Hayward Village community!  I've lived at Hayward Village almost 3 years, and must say I look forward to better living ahead.

I work Monday through Friday 9-5 and don't get to see a lot of what goes on in our building, I do see however a manager who knows what is good for clean housing, knows the importance of paying attention to the needs of the tenants and the property.

I’ve lived here 1 1/2 years and love it. The property inside and out is very well maintained. I love the workout room, the grounds, hot tub and beautiful dog run. The whole staff, management and maintenance, are great to work with.

< Review>
I have been a resident for 11 years.  A month after my arrival, Zero stars.  With the multiplicity of managers, I think the owners have finally found a person with the management skills and demeanor to handle a diverse demographic with its fair share of residents and some  who are just ornery.
It will take time to get resident behavior to accept rules agreed to at signing of lease.
The only problem I forsee is finding a person to complement our remaining maintenance person.  Most have had rudimentary housekeeping experience with no supplemental skills as the employee who just left.  Only 3 capable personnel in 11 years now just 1.  All in all, as a senior approaching 80, Hayward Village Senior Apartments is clean, quiet and restfull.  What more does a senior need other than good health and longevity.  If you are a nice person and not prone to find fault with every little thing then apply.< /Review>

This place has had multiple management staff over the past five years. The place is not well kept with dirty carpets due to pets and people dragging their garbage bags to the garbage shoot. The workout room is not maintained for cleanliness and the garbage dumpsters outside are always overflowing.  My mother lives here and the inside of the actual apartment is really nice because my mom is a neat and clean person. However she cant utilize her patio because of the pigeon problem that they cant seem to control. So opening the patio door to get fresh air is impossible. It's been a fee years with little to no resolve to this disgusting issue! Do better people! You get enough money for the upkeep to be in much better condition!< /review>

<Review>I have deiced to change my review from 2 years ago.

Hayward Village has been through many changes, and I can finally say I think Roman is the right person for this place. The building is immaculate, thanks to Martha, the housekeeper. I've never seen the office so clean and organized, so it's very welcoming and inviting.

I recommend Hayward Village 100%

Thank You Hayward Village for providing me with a clean & safe home.</Review>< pics>

<text>If you like stepping back in time to bold Bob's Big Boy restaurant this is the place to go. Remind you of old time spent with friends and family. Although you may notice there is a Bob's Big Boy statue out front and he is wearing a cowboy hat. We have never seen Bob where cowboy hat or any other hat that matter. But it's a nice change of pace. Modernizes the place. Stop in for a visit.<//text>< Resp>

The service was great, the food was served hot and delicious! The manager was one of the best managers I've ever seen! He knows how to make a guest feel welcome! He runs the restaurant efficiently and the staff was very pleasant! He is an asset to Bob's Big Boy!</review>

Only gave a 4 star because the strawberry pie wasn't sweet enough. Excellent burger, fries, and salad. Same taste and memory of years past.< /Text>

<Review>The service was great, we ordered to go and ate on the patio with our small dog. They waited to make our dessert until we were ready. It was clean and nice outside.

This wasy first time back to a Bob's Big Boy in like 15 years. I anticipated the chili spaghetti and was excited to share the experience with our kids. While the noodles were perfectly cooked, everything tasted really bland.

I was surprised when one of my kids, a picky eater, said the french fry he tried was bad. I grabbed it to see what he was talking about and took a bite of his rejection.

It tasted like manure! This ruined my experience completely. I have never had this happen anywhere else.

My wife said afterward that other reviews mention this phenomenon. I cannot recommend you gamble eating here.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1620056082335, 'text': 'Hi Michael, we are so sorry to hear about your experience.

The food just is t the same as I've aged. I guess things will mostly be better when your young. Its pandemic time and there offering dine in seating. Mask are preferred  and employees aren't wearing gloves. Support the owners and their cause. Or stay at home and support your own cause <life>⁰</Text>

My family and I came to this location last Sunday to grab some dinner since we were in the area. It was the worst experience I ever had.

To whoever is the regional manager of this restaurant I want you to contact me.
right away. I have several complaints about this location.

I don’t understand how this location has a 4.5 rating?</Review>

Was a pleasant surprise to dine in.
I got a rueben sandwich the corn beef was a bit tough.
And baked potatoe could have been softer.
My husband really enjoyed his burger.
We saw it from the freeway so had to try, its been years since we have been to Bob's big boy.
The hot fudge cake was sooooo good.
Will be back again.

The service was excellent and friendly.< /text>

Went on a Saturday afternoon and got right in. The restaurant was not every busy so it was a nice change of not having to wait on a Saturday to eat. Service was fast and all wait staff helped clear our table and run orders which was good to see. Food came out hot and fresh which was great because my wife got breakfast and I ordered lunch which usually leads to poor timing by the kitchen and one of the orders is cold, but that was not an issue here. I will return and recommend this to friends and family.</text>

<Review>Never even heard of the place but staying in Norco had to try it. Cool little spot! Very friendly staff and atmosphere was cool. Good food as well. I have to be honest I wasn't that impressed with the burger but had some of my friends turkey bacon club and it was really good! I'm sure all the food is really good and would come back again if I'm in the area.<//Review>< pics>

The food was delicious however I asked the Manger a question regarding the quarantine and he was clearly frustrated.
My question was dismissed and asked what I wanted to drink.
I felt like I annoyed him more....I won't be asking him anymore questions</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Went on a Saturday afternoon and got right in. The restaurant was not every busy so it was a nice change of not having to wait on a Saturday to eat. Service was fast and all wait staff helped clear our table and run orders which was good to see. Food came out hot and fresh which was great because my wife got breakfast and I ordered lunch which usually leads to poor timing by the kitchen and one of the orders is cold, but that was not an issue here. I will return and recommend this to friends and family.<//Text>< pics>

Food was delicious! First time I came here was on Thursday , the 11th of June 2020. I love this style of restaurants. Especially the decor and music. I tried the Super Big Boy. Thankful for the restaurant being open. Waitresses take great care of you. You get your money's worth. Next time I will try the shakes and that's for sure because summer is already here!<//review>

This place was way over hyped... spent 32 bucks on 2 combos that weren't anything special... it wasnt a big burger and it wasnt anything that would make me want to return... but maybe i just got the wrong thing would probably give it another chance later<//Text>

Cute retro 50's diner with great decor, nice sized patio, lots of parking. Staff are always friendly and attentive and food is delish with good prices for good sized portions. Big menu. Try their handmade ice cream shakes! They have a neat little gift shop too with some rare finds. The place is always clean and spotless. Great place for a date or large group gathering. I mean it's Bob's Big Boy!! :) Ever since the one in Diamond Bar closed this is the only one in the area and I'm really glad it's still here. I hope they stay forever, definitely some nostalgia!

<Text>This place brings back memories of my childhood. Chili spaghetti was always my fave back then, but now I can't tear myself away from the Classic Big Boy burger with fries. The season salt is a must have on the fries! Don't forget to save room for dessert, the hot fudge cake is to die for good.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>The Big Boy burgers are always great!!! I rarely order anything else. Had a vanilla shake last time I was in & marveled at how good it was!!! I'd forgotten. They really are great!!! Also had an order of onion rings for the 1st time & they were also excellent!
A couple of years ago or more a waitress turned me on to the taste sensation of their Blue Cheese dressing with french fries which is my new favorite way to eat them.
You can't go wrong at Bob's Big Boy that's for sure!!!<//Text><UserId.>115836130669390315271</UserId.>< response>

Great car show, Bob's big boy special is 12.99 used to be 1.29, haha, but that was in 1961! Friday night special it was 99 cents. The burger is bigger now though.<//Text>

Friendly staff but waited 20+ mins for a single To-go burger at $12 and drive away to see its wrong. Turn around and wait another 20 mins. Return not likely.<//Text>

<text>After a few months of Stay At Home, I decided to venture out to the Bob's Big Boy in Norco.   I am fan of Big Boy's Hamburger since I was about 5 - 6 years old.     I was born and raised in Pasadena.  My parents would go to the Bob's Big Boy on Colorado.  We either ate in the small take out patio or took the burgers home.   Pasadena did have 3 Bob's Big Boy.     Two on Colorado Blvd. and 1 on Lake Ave.   I do miss them.  Even the ones in Barstow, CA are closed now.  There is only 3 left here.  The original in Burbank, CA, Downey, CA and Norco, CA.

We drove down to Norco for lunch.   I called ahead to make sure they have dine-in service.  They do have dine-in service.  We were greeted by the host and seated right away.  The waitress was very courteous, attentive and very friendly.

She took our drink orders and we were ready to order.  I had their Big Boy combo (regular size) not the jumbo size one.

Salad was fresh.  The burger came with fries.   I truly enjoyed the Big Boy hamburger.  It's been a while since I ate one too.

The server kept on coming back making sure drinks were filled and making sure we were happy with food.

I would recommend this place.   Very close to the freeway too.

I would go back to Bob's Big Boy again.< /text>< Rate>

We went for the breakfast buffet. We got are first plate and there was some food. But when we went to get are second plate we   had to wait for food to be put in buffet. The waitress had to let the manager know that food wasn't out.  Other people came in wanted buffet and had to also ask when the buffet would be refilled. And then I saw a waiter throw a potato back in the container that was sitting on the side of the counter. It took a few minutes and the the manager was helping to bring out more food for the buffet. Probably never go back there for the buffet.<//Text>

Okay. Now this place is iconic in SoCal and I haven't been to a big boy in close to 30 years. I saw a sign off the 15 freeway and said..Dang! Gotta stop and get a burger. I did and well it was much better in memory than it was today. The burger was similar to the big mac, when I was hoping for something different and was missing the seasoning. I know I know salt is bad... but my gosh it's good on meet when cooking. So basically it was missing the taste I was hoping for from my childhood memory. The fries were great as was the salad with Bob's ranch dressing.  The service from the folks working was fantastic and the restaurant itself was classic old time comfort.  I will be back to try something else on the menu as I saw a number of items that looked good. I will update one I try something else.</Review>

As a child I was taken and never forgot.
First time in 30 years, and it was such a great decision.

The Turkey bacon sandwich is amazing!
The bread was hot, the turkey was grilled, the lettuce and tomato was cold.
Perfect.
Thank you for a great dinner and service!<//Text>

Honestly, despite all I'd heard about this place, my burger was incredibly dry and I could barely finish half of it before feeling like it was just too much grease. On top of that, our waitress essentially made me feel bad for not eating it on two separate stops at our table. The pickle fries were great, but I kinda wish I'd just gone for the breakfast bar.< /text>

I had no idea they were still in operation. I haven't been to a Bob's Big Boy sense my childhood in the 70's. The diner was clean with really friendly service. The place has that old time small town diner feel. I will absolutely return.<//review>

<review>It's always been my favorite burger and it was as good as I remember it to be! It's nice that there are a few of these restaurants left to enjoy. Amazing how many wonderful memories are connected to a burger. Memories that go back to the 1950's. Great food, service and memories.</review>< rate>

It's always been my favorite burger and it was as good as I remember it to be! It's nice that there are a few of these restaurants left to enjoy. Amazing how many wonderful memories are connected to a burger. Memories that go back to the 1950's. Great food, service and memories.< /Text>

<Review>My husband and I went here for our first time. He ordered the Double Cheeseburger and I had the Jack Avocado Omelette, however, they have failed me. My Omelette tasted like plastic and the cheeseburger was cold. On the other hand, the fries were good and crispy. Service was average. Would have prefer In-N-Out, at least everything would be fresh and hot.</Review>< gmapID>

<review>No matter which Big Boy I go to, the fix is always the same. Prepared well, tastes good, and it arrives quickly. I hardy ever go for dinner, but I love this place for breakfast and lunch. The staff at this location is friendly and their service is immaculate. Prices are great, too.</review><gmapID>0x80dcc9e418783719:0x68fa77f84e702fa0<//gmapID>< Rating>

Haven't been to a Bob's Big Boy in years, so we thought we'd try it. It didn't disappoint and it didn't overly impress. We enjoyed a decent lunch in a clean & friendly restaurant. Similar menu & prices to Dennys, but the food was slightly better.</Review>

< review>
The buffet was old food that should not have been served after 11am.  We came in at 1pm and was told that the food was fresh.  That was not the case.  I love boys since I was a child but this had to be my worst nightmare of a meal.  The hot cocoa tasted liked water, the potatoes were dried out and the eggs were cold. Only thing good was the salad bar.  Next time I will be ordering my food from the menu.</review>

<review>Clean place with a typically friendly staff that brings back memories of my childhood, since we visited Bob's a lot back then. My favorites are the patty melt and the Ruben. Generally,  the service has been fast and the food has been fresh. I do recall one meal that took a while to arrive and some of it was no longer warm. To be fair, when we complained, they went and reheated it. Thus is why I gave them 4 stars.< /review>< user_name>

I remember going to Bob's Big Boy when I was a kid. And then they closed most of them down. I'm glad there's still a few around. They're very friendly and courteous here. Clean establishment. I love the breakfast buffet/bar. It never gets old.<//Text>

Burgers were nothing special and fries were just gross. They were not crunchy, just very chewy. Decided to order dessert and asked for fudge brownie and ice cream. The "brownie" was literally plain brown bread with old tasting fudge and had vanilla Ice cream with hidden pieces of ice in it. I would skip this place if you're looking to actually enjoy your meal.<//review>

We went for a hot fudge cake and we were not disappointed! The service was great and the dessert was delicious. There was no wait. Not too many people inside.</Text>

<Text>Love Bobs. Whoa, careful how you read that. I love those too but that's a different review. I have been going to Bob's (Burbank) since before I was born. This was my mom's pregnant craving. I live the Big Boy combo with blue cheese and always get a side of tomatoes relish to add to my burger. The fried chicken is super yummy too. Great place for casual family dining and good food that won't break the bank.< /Text>< pics>

The service was on par for a restaurant. We showed up late morning and they offered a breakfast buffet. We opted to order from the menu to get something a bit more fresh. Scrambled eggs, hash browns, pancakes, french toast, etc. My scrambled eggs were undercooked and the pancakes were reheated in the microwave, you can tell because dough gets a rubber consistency when it's overly reheated in the microwave. The hash browns were super greasy. Nice people, but I don't think we'll be back.<//text>

<Review>Burgers,  stuffed potato pancakes,  chili spaghetti  are all highlights.  Frequent classic car shows in the parking lot. Great diner food.  Nostalgic SoCal chain.  Fun, cheerful waitresses.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I went hear for breakfast and was presently surprised to find a really good selection of items.  They even had potato pancakes which I ordered.  They even had a solid breakfast buffet for about $13.
The selection was the win, the problem was everything we tried was only okay at best.  I was hoping for so much more.
The price was right the taste was alright at best.< /Text>< user>

<review>I'm amazed. How does Bob's Big Boy make consistently great burgers every time you come in. Year after year after year. I've been eating Big Boy hamburgers for over 60 years now and they're just as good as the first time I tried one. Amazing. The best hamburger in Southern California. Maybe the whole world.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>Best burgers we have had in a while. It was great making a burger the way we like it...with the different topping available. The salad bar looked great for next time.
Thanks for the big parking area as we were towing a trailer.

I love the build your own burger and all you can eat soup and salad bar.  I like the chili size and dessert menu here.  They don't season the food or salt the fries so you need to do that yourself.<//text>

I will never return to this restaurant. I was served a burger on a moldy bun. I then ordered a short stack of pancakes. I was served two pancakes that were about an 1/8" thick, really I mean wafer thin! They tasted like they were cooked on a dirty grill. To my surprise, I was charged $7.00 for said pancakes. The manager was too busy to be bothered to come address us personally. The cashier did however discount my ticket a few dollars. Bottom line, a good manager would have come to the table and apologized. Further more, the entire check should have been free because that is what great customer service about. What an absolute joke of an establishment. AVOID THIS PLACE!<//review>

First time in CA and I was told to try this regional chain out and I was not disappointed. I had what they call the best cheeseburger in the world and while the name is a bit of a stretch the burger itself was fantastic. Their red relish really makes the burger. The fri seasoning is addictive as anything.</text>

Waitress and hostess were very nice, but she was the only one on the floor so when we needed something else or extra, it was a bit annoying trying to get her attention.  We did though get the older lady who I think was the hostess,  and she definitely took care of what we needed immediately. Bob's big boy just doesn't taste the same as it used to. I think that will be our last visit there. We had to search another table for their seasoning salt. As a customer,  I think its important to make sure all items are on the table before being seated so when our food gets to the table, we can eat instead of looking around for something that is missing. We dined around 4pm and there were maybe one other table eating as we were being seated.<//review>

<Text>Bob's Big Boy. this is a really old Drive-In style restaurant that has like a Denny's menu basically burgers and Sandwiches and Such it's not bad but they have pretty much everything that everyone else has what I liked best was the service The Waitresses there are super helpful and attend to your needs so the service will keep me coming back even though the burgers are just a regular hamburger with cheese and what they call Red relish which is what I call ketchup. all in all it wasn't bad.<//Text>< Date>

<text>You know it's a shame for all the take-out dinners that we have had from Bob's big boy from all the dinners that we have eaten in restaurant at Bob's big boy tonight the order is very pathetic their quality is going down apparently they prefer profit over quality and satisfied customers. Apparently when Marie callender's closed their restaurant in Corona Bob's big boy Norco figures that they can slack and they won't lose any business to the competition little did they know but Bob's big boy Norco is losing business. We have ordered the same takeout dinners from this restaurant a few times and tonight it got to the point where I just had to post a review on Yelp and now on Google.  Unfortunately it's not a good one and it is their own fault from the manager down to that blond pretty boy they have taking the order behind the counter. I ordered a Cobb salad and usually it would fill the takeout container here is the picture of what we got for a Cobb salad there is no Roquefort cheese on it,  there is no egg on it all it is is basically lettuce some turkey shredded bits a ton of bacon bits and a quarter of an avocado and I had to ask for more Italian dressing. As far as the chicken-fried steak goes or country fried steak whatever they call it.  When we would order a mashed potato as a side they would give you two scoops plus a cup of mashed potatoes now they say when you order the potato on the side it's just the scoop of potatoes I guess it depends on who is cooking in the kitchen that night. (I can't call them a chef because they do not act or perform as a chef) with a fruit cup as you can see they give you a quarter of the cup and cantaloupe that has the Rhine on it which is green and a lot of grapes. I ordered mine with the cottage cheese he gave me a little cup of cottage cheese the size that the dressing would be in for the cobb salad I had to make them go back and put it in a normal sized container like what they used to do all in all Bob's big boy Norco has lost another customer I would definitely drive the extra 17 miles up to Riverside to Marie callender's on the corner of Merrill avenue and Riverside avenue right behind the Riverside plaza and next door to market broiler which by the way has excellent fish oh my gosh it is to die for, but I digress the location is perfect because Christmas is coming and we can go shopping at the Riverside plaza and then go to Marie callender's and have a very nice dinner with a slice of pie of course who does not like Marie callender pies for Thanksgiving ?  so really we're killing two birds with one stone to coin a phrase. You know my grandparents and my aunt and uncle that used to go to Bob's big boy all the time would be rolling over in their graves about now.  This is pathetic so long Bob it's been fun but like they say all good things must come to an end and you've definitely proven it.< /text><Name>Pit bull Lover</Name></record>

The food was delicious but overpriced and small, small, small portions. ?$5.99 for childs chicken tenders. 2 small tenders and literally 10 scranny little french fries. Fish dinner 2 small pieces of fish fries and slaw which was fine, except used to be 3 peieces of fish for ?10.99. Now its ?13.99 for 2 small pieces of fish. No wonder there business has gone down so badly.< /Text>

Great food.  I had the Chicken Parmesan.  My wife had the Fish and Chips.  We both really liked our meals.  The portions were very appropriate.  Not too small, and not crazy large.  I will definitely be back.</Text>

The only issue we've had is some of the service has been poor and unprofessional. The waitresses seem nice, but the cashier we've had twice now was rude and standoffish after ignoring us and we were really nice to her. I find this to be common in this area though, for some reason. Everything else was good. We have breakfast here now and then. Good family place.</review>< Pictures>

Their burger combos are well worth the price. Definitely my go to spot for best burgers ever. Like actual burgers no thin ass patties on a diet engulfed by a bun. The mouthwatering meaty magicalness was magnificence incarnate.  Customer service here is also on point. Get here.

This is the only place I know where they need to hype up more to meet the quality they put out.</Text>

Bob's Big Boy tastes exactly as it did as far as I can remember. Excellent! The burgers were fresh the meat was cooked just right and the fries were crunchy and amazing! The drive to NorCal is so beautiful, very patriotic I love how they have the red white and blue stripes on some of the streets, so American I love it! Highly recommended!< /review>

My single party burger came with 3 buns. Frys were soso didn't finish them. The only thing that was decent was my malt. But everything was over $17. Not worth it at all.<//Text>

Staff is friendly and helpful but just wasnt into the food. I ordered chili thinking it was home made - like and it was was more like the chili you put on top of burgers just too heavy for me. Again, waitress was very sweet and accommodating.<//Text>

This is a great place to eat a breakfast buffet. It's always refreshing to walk into a restaurant and find a grade A from the health department in the front window. Great job people! My favorite place in Norco to eat even though I'm only here once every 5 months! Debra from Crest Ridge Saddlery!!!< /text>

<Text>Husband got the cheeseburger said it didn't taste very good, my mother in law got the tilapia with vegetables and mashed potatoes. She liked it but I had a bite and it was not fresh and the veggies looked brown. I had the chili cheese fries. If I would've known that they put that canned nacho cheese stuff on it I would not have ordered it. It was way to spicy for me.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Terrible service with sub par over priced ice cream. 0 out of 10 would not recommend. As a fellow ice cream scooper this is a disgrace to our title. These employee's are sticking a bad name on the ice cream parlor name. If google gave me the choice I would give this restaurant zero stars out of 5. I first walked into the restaurant and first noticed that they were more about selling gift shop items than the food itself, after about 15 minutes of waiting to be sat in a half empty restaurant a server finally stood up and sat us down. The server took and absurd amount of time to check on her other tables and by the time our table got ordered I could have probably just driven back home( and I live in Utah!!!). You also can't forget that the person dishing the ice cream was a complete amateur smashing the ice cream and packing it in the glass(no longer creamy but more giving it the taste of freezer burn) to also(no surprise) forget to stick the hot fudge and the hot fudge sundae!!! YOU LITERALLY HAVE ONE JOB AND CAN'T EVEN SCOOP HOT FUDGE ONTO A FREAKIN' HOT FUDGE SUNDAE. I also can't get passed the fact that I payed over $4 for this pathetic excuse of ice cream. I'm not surprised by the fact that the it was almost empty when we walked in. You can also tell the effort of a location by the cleanliness of the restrooms, don't even make me go there, The ice cream was bad enough. Who ever the manager is needs to get a grip on that place and teach some server etiquette. CUSTOMERS ALWAYS COME FIRST AND SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT AN ETERNITY TO GET A SCOOP OF ICE CREAM. The only good thing that happened inside of this restaurant was that the cashier didn't even bother ask for a tip CAUSE HE KNEW NO ONE IN THAT RESTAURANT DESERVED A TIP, LET ALONE MINIMUM WAGE.<//Text><UserId.>105209112230858524380< /UserId.>< pictures>

<Review>Lots of good food and the buffet was great. I just learned that they make their own fresh pies on premises when I inquired about the first place blue ribbon by the cash register.

<text>Tracy was very attentive, however when ordering a hot fudge cake, she asked another worker if she would mind making it... Her reply was " well I'm not off, I guess I'll have to make it"... didn't seem like she really cared to be here. Another employee that was talking about going to a reception to that same worker was dragging a pair of worn sandals all over the food counter...

<text>I had a loaded bowl of chili beans and garlic bread it was delicious a company with ultimate fudge brownie. The novelty of the place was as cool as I remember it.

I think the food is good. Just was sort of a ghost town in there. I wonder why they dont get more business. Could be they can be a bit pricey for burgers but the atmosphere is nice. My only complaint was the salad bar. There wasnt any iceberg lettuce i had to ask for more and wait for it. An all you can eat salad bar should always be stocked. The guy at the entrance was very friendly. The waitress was too but we had to ask for a few things and her face looked a bit overwhelmed at one point. Its ok to feel youve got too much going on but as a waitress you cant be showing that in front of the customers.<//Review>

First time ever coming to Bob's Big Boy, it was amazing! The food was delicious and i wish i saved room for dessert. Our waitress Racheal was awesome! Very kind and attentive. She was taking care of our table and 3 others... Plus a LARGE party! She really was on top of everything. Great Job Bob!!< /Review>

<Text>The food is good don't get me wrong but every time I get salad bar dinner lunch or breakfast I get sick!! I really don't think they check anything once they've put it there. It just stays there for hours on a warmer. Yesterday all I are was a bowl of soup and a salad and the toilet was my best friend the rest of the night. No more salad bar for me. DON'T GO TO THE SALAD BAR!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80dcc9e418783719:0x68fa77f84e702fa0</gmapID>< response>

We hadn't been to Bob's in a loong time since they don't have many around. So, since we were unfamiliar with the area we looked up what was around. As soon as my husband saw Bob's Big Boy there was no more search! The food and the service was great and the restaurant clean.<//text>

The food was awful. I ordered a steak with shrimp and mashed potatoes. The shrimp was okay, but the steak had absolutely no flavor. It just tasted like water. The potatoes were obviously fake, but they didn't even taste as good as normal instant potatoes. It was disgusting and I will never go back. My server was very nice though, she took back the food and had it removed from the bill with no arguments or snooty comments.</review>

I was impressed by the large sizes of the food we ordered. I loved my fish sandwich, but my wife wasn't as happy with her food and her fruit wasn't very good. Some of it was too ripe.</Text>

Great customer service but the food definitely wasn't worth the price.  Spent almost 70 bucks on 4 tiny entrees and a sundae</review>

Normally pretty tasty, last time was a bit of a disappointment. Buns were past the freshness date on the edge of stale. The whole combo plate, especially the fries, was pretty dry. Not a good day for a Bob's lunch.< /review>

The people who work there are so nice, always busy. Offers a military discount. But today the chicken was dry and the burgers had no taste. Will go back though cause it's Bob's. And the only one nearby.<//text>

We were excited to go to Bob's burgers for the first time. Then the waitress Grace came to our table and she was so rude she didn't let my husband finish ordering wen she tried to make it seem like we were both dumb. Then when our order was ready she jus looked at me didn't say a word slammed my plates on the table jus said oh and walked away. Not satisfied with the service given after being so exited to visit this resturaunt☹️< /review>

Yay!  This Bob's Big Boy is the original!  I've come here for years to eat and check out all of the radical vehicles on Classic Car Night, Fridays starting around 4pm.  Great shakes and a good set of options for vegetarians as well as meat eaters!</Text>

P.S. If your going for desert, go for a malt, it's practically you buy 1 and get 1 free cause they bring you your malt in its glass and they bring you the left over part of your malt which fills up your whole glass.</Review><username>reuben arias (plasmahero16)</username>< rate>

Got the big boy combo. There was too much special sauce and the french fries were way undercooked.  Service was slow. Overall poor visit<//review>

This is difficult to write because I drive 2 hours to come here and it's usually yummy yum yum. I came here the second week of July and it was horrible.
I am here today and it's just as bad. Have they changed the Big Boy burger? Something isn't right. Yuck. Not worth the drive for me if it stays like this.  And I am a fan of Bobs. Blech. The waitress was very nice though. Youngish, pretty, dark hair. The cashier asked me about it. I don't know. It just doesn't taste good.</Text>

I wasn't impressed with their food. I got a chicken Cesar wrap and it was mostly salad and barley any chicken. I got my son chicken strips and they had no flavor.<//text>

Going here is hit and miss. Food is ok but service is not that good. Last visit waited 20 minutes for the server to greet us at the table after being seated and take a drink order or whatever. Got tired of waiting and left. Was not that crowded to explain a 20 min wait for a server after being seated.</Review>

The classic meals are all from frozen. No hand made burgers here. Frozen fish, frozen chicken... The only thing not frozen is their salads. The Mexican chicken salad was good, but the spicy salsa dressing left a lit to be desired.<//Text>

<Review>The wait staff was not very efficient, the sandwich was pretty awful even though the menu had it listed as a favorite, and I had to return the fries because they were raw and I prefer extra crispy.  Not a fun experience.<//Review>< name>

This is my favorite burger (sorry In-n-Out!)  I have ONLY had the Big Boy Classic Burger and their Fudge Cake dessert...EVER, so can't attest to their other food offerings, but they have a small salad bar and a large menu. You can get your drinks made with Vanilla or Cherry. They serve Pepsi products unfortunately...sad.
I just know this is comfort food for me! They have a 50's vibe inside with booths and tables in red, white and blue decor.   Service is fast and great most of the time.  They sometimes have Car Shows in there large parking lot.  There is a " Malt and Ice Cream Shoppe" inside the restaurant with a small gift shop selling cookies, candy T-Shirts and gifts.  This is "Americana" modernized!
Did you know that the Bob's Big Boy statue which stands outside the Norco restaurant, is the only one to have their " Bob's mascot" altered? They received special permission to add the cowboy hat on Bob!  Norco is "Horsetown USA" where the horses outnumber the people.<//review></record>

Good Classic American restaurant, the food selection is so tasty I would like 1 of each so I try to eat something different everytime. However their Chilli Spaghetti is by far MY Favorite dish, the kind u order 1 for here & 1 for lunch, I highly recommend it if you like eating pasta.</Text>

<Text>Party of 7. Two of us had menu salads and were sickened 7hrs later which lasted 24hrs. What does say about sanitary. The other 5 were ok and had no salad. The clean-up person at the salad bar was abusively slamming the dishes to the point several people announced loud verbal protests. We have been there a number of times but never again.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>In ancient times, Bob's Big Boy restaurants herds roamed the plains in abundance.
Then came the dark times when evil corporations ran the chain into the ground.
Today there are few remaining Bob's Big Boys left in the wild. The iconic Big Boy combo with the Bleu Cheese dressing of my childhood is now a rarity as stores in Diamond Bar close.  There are only a handful of stores left. This store was not crowded on a Saturday night, which makes me worry about its future. I'm sure the original Toluca Lake store will be around forever...but please people, visit all the stores so that you and your progeny can experience an American classic.<//text>< Pics>

I'm sorry but this place is way over rated. The food has no flavor at all, the place looks run down, and the staff look unhappy, my server reminded me of Eeyore. My food really looked like it was fresh out of a can.<//text>

Came here after a long day of shopping for Christmas. The staff was great, but it took over an hour to get our food and honestly, it wasn't that busy. The food was decent, bit not worth the hour long wait. Would go back, but not after a long day.<//Review>

Been here twice in the past 3 months or so and walked out somewhat unimpressed each each time. Food's decent enough don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't go any better than just decent. Service has seemed a tad slow the times I've been where and it seems a bit pricy for the portion size and food quality I've experienced. Bottom line: Not bad, but there's definitely better food nearby for the price.<//text>

<name>Rob Titus<//name>< Review>
In ancient times, Bob's Big Boy restaurants herds roamed the plains in abundance.
Then came the dark times when evil corporations ran the chain into the ground.
Today there are few remaining Bob's Big Boys left in the wild. The iconic Big Boy combo with the Bleu Cheese dressing of my childhood is now a rarity as stores in Diamond Bar close.  There are only a handful of stores left. This store was not crowded on a Saturday night, which makes me worry about its future. I'm sure the original Toluca Lake store will be around forever...but please people, visit all the stores so that you and your progeny can experience an American classic.< /Review>

<Review>A big variety of items here, and even a brunch buffet. The burger patties are a bit thin here compared to other Bob's I ate at, but that seems to be a problem in this city altogether. I guess they wanna vegan you into the subconscious. History explains it.</Review>< user>

I came from a whole other state to eat at the iconic Bobs Big Boy a piece of Americana pop culture. I was never greeted, never asked what we wanted to drink. When we said something all we got was a "SORRY" then offered a drink as we left. Well im not sorry i will not ever eat at that location ever again.< /Text>< pics>

Terrible food, good service.  Don't go for nostalgia's sake. We used to go when we were in high school and college, but the big boy burger was nowhere near what it used to be.  Boo hoo.</review>

<text>The wait for food was long, the food was standard food nothing special, except my dad really loved their special red relish they put on the big boy burger.

Don't go there at lunch if you have limitrd time.  The service was real slow.  Pretty bad when you just order a hamburger and fries, then you see other tables that were sat after you, getting there food before yours.  Then when the fodd finally came it was cold.  If time isn't an issue, have at it.< /Text>

I haven't been there in a year and we just want recently for my sister's birthday as more of a Sentimental thing when we were kids . a year ago it was quite tasty and fresh, this time not so much. I was astounded at the price of the souvenirs also.<//Review>

Stopped at Norco location , got a Big Boy burger and Dr Pepper soda , why cannot the cooks have the pride to put the relish on the bun , so you get some with each bite . Soda tasted like cough syrup . Very sad .<//Text>< rating>

I wouldn't even give them 1 star, wish you could leave 0. We just left because they sat us down and we waited for 15 minutes and no one ever helped us and it wasn't even busy or full. So we got up and left 😒< /review>

<Text>Bob's 40-plus years ago ,till they most closed were a family treat . Stopped at Norco location , got a Big Boy burger and Dr Pepper soda , why cannot the cooks have the pride to put the relish on the bun , so you get some with each bite . Soda tasted like cough syrup . Very sad .<//Text></record></dataset><record>
