<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I went in for a covid test and they billed me for a $330 outpatient visit, a smokers consultation, and preventative care of some sort. My insurance covers all covid testing but I have a copay on outpatient visits.

I have never smoked in my life so I obviously did not have a smokers consultation, I did not have an outpatient visit as detailed by my insurance as history, exam and medical decisions. When I called to ask, the billing department was INCREDIBLY rude and refused to even talk to me about my bill. She insisted I was billed for a covid test when I have the bill sitting in front of me that says something completely different. I will be fighting this bill, this is ridiculous.< /review>< Pictures>

There are some level of ignorance in the world, but the awesome team here broke the record. After waiting for almost 2 hours in line they want me to do the line again, just because I didn't got the a paper they give when you get in line. It was a miss understanding from both parts, but the only solution they gave me was to do the 2 hour line again. The supervisor Maria and the assistant at the door couldn't handle the situation in a worse way. It make sense the poor reviews here.</text>

<review>I’m back to edit my review. So after I was on hold for 1.5 hours I called back the next day and was only on hold for 2 minutes she answered all my questions but unfortunately got disconnected I called back and didn’t wait for long at all she was very friendly and I was there for about 3 hours which I didn’t mind waiting I had been exposed and needed my test results ASAP. I recommend asking the girl at the door if they take your insurance so you’re not there wasting your time if you have tricare they take it that’s what I have. I went around 6:30pm and towards the end of the night if you don’t get the white piece of paper you will not be seen again check with the girl in the front so you don’t waste your time. After I got tested it took 2 hours for me to get my results

This place should be called “premier urgent care please hold” do not hold she’s never going to answer.< /review><Response>None</Response>< user_name>

<review>Absolutely horrible experience. Was suggested by work that I come here for a same day results Covid test. Was told while in line that they no longer had that as an option. I decided to stay for the regular test since I was there anyways. Even though I arrived right at opening, it took over five hours before they were finally able to test me. Even though they said results would be available in 3-5 days, I'm still waiting on an answer eleven days later. Any attempts to contact them have been ignored. Worst of all, I suspect that I contracted Covid while in their waiting room, as I developed symptoms several says later.<//review>< time>

< review>
I made 6 hours of line for covid test due to last time I went and they messed on my daughter's name for the test and I clearly told them that wasn't her name. Later on I got a call she was positive I am not saying she is not positive or is but it confused me extremely knowing they had the wrong name at the beggining how can I clearly believe or think they got her result right? I did line again 5 hours just to be told "sorry but I can't do it again" even if I offered to pay....is not your money or your time. I just wanted to check if my daughter has covid or not due to their own errors of name mix. That's very bad. Is not a whatever topic. Is a topic everyone should take serious especially nurses. Who did it hurt for my daughter to get tested again not them at all.</review>

<text>No covid safety guidelines in place. They allowed entire families into waiting room to wait with patient. When I was called in, I was put in a small, closed,  dirty exam room where I waited about 10 min for person who did swab testing. She did not explain provider  well, was in a hurry, and overall was a bad experience. I wonder why OSHA or Department of health would keep them open.< /text>< Pics>

Extremely rude staff. They did not allow me to be seen by a doctor and was called a little boy to top it off, which I’m clearly not. What person does that? How did these people even get a job here? The only times I was seen, the doctor was just as rude and didn’t offer any help. They should all be fired and replaced.<//Text>

If I could give zero stars I would.
The lady answering the calls is so rude and won’t even let you ask a question without shutting you off quick. If you cant understand what they’re saying they’ll get mad and raise their voice at you. I’ve been to too many clinics and this clinic is the worse! Also their AC doesn’t work so be prepared to be there for hours with no ac.< /Review>

<Text>Went in with broken foot and their X-ray machine was not working so was sent to Oasis Imaging and there was attended immediately was given a cd with results and sure enough 4 broken bones. Couldn’t afford  ER copay so called my primary who was gone sent me back to urgent care for walking shoe and a prescription for pain, they didn’t have any stock to address my foot not even an ace bandage, he’ll didn’t even offer to rewrap the used one I had on. Then as far as the prescription, didn’t have a doctor who could write a triplicate RX for my pain. I decided to hobble my way out of there and 5 people on staff watched me and not one offered to open the door. The worse place ever!! I’m telling everyone I know to never go there, they’re not competent to deal with human being. I’m turning them in to the city, county and whoever will listen. Gloria Guillen< /Text></record>

< Review>
I went to Permier Urgent care in San Bernardino which my healthnet provider covers with a leg gash from an encounter with a vicious trundle bed.  The place was packed with people wearing masks but not social distancing.  I asked if I could wait outside in my car and call my cell when I was up.  Rude counter girl said no you have to wait inside.  I said are you serious and she smiled and said yes.  I turned around and went down the street to another urgent care newly opened next to the surgical Pharmacy on Sierra and highland.  My insurance didn't cover it but $55 to be seen no one in the waiting room.  Sweet Samantha at the desk and a beautiful funny Jamaican decent Doctor that fixed me right up.  What a difference.  If your getting tested at the other one if you don’t have covid now you will in 2 weeks.</Review>

One Star I’m rating this place only to put my review, this place is a real dump the staff is rude and they come arguing with the patients like they are the big thing. How in the world are we supposed to seek medical attention with this kind of people around . I rather go to non profit medical clinics at least they are more respectful of humans and Premier Urgent Care Staff if you are reading this U S***k!!! Worst place ever !</text>

I don’t know where to begin... all I needed was a TB test for my employer. First the clinic didn’t know if they accepted my insurance. The receptionist told me she would be able to tell me till after the services were billed. At this point I was desperate so I told her that was fine.
I told her to go ahead and proceed, I was in need of my TB test. I took my TB test on a Wednesday and returned on a Saturday. My test was negative, I needed paperwork filled out by their doctor or nurse practitioner whatever he is... all I know is that his name is Greg... he declined to fill out my paperwork and gave me a lab order to do blood work & a chest X-ray. I told him I didn’t see why that was necessary since I didn’t test positive. Mind you that Saturday I returned the receptionist told me my co payment was going to be $50. How could it go from $15 the first day to $50 the returning day. So I told him thank you for your time. I’m sorry you don’t know how to read a order for a employer. All the additional tests he wanted me to do was unnecessary. I went to that clinic since it’s close to my work. Never again. I returned home on my days off to my Public Health Department, explained the situation I went through they couldn’t even understand his reasoning. Never again will I return here. I wouldn’t even recommend this place. Only one star because of the nice young lady who was polite and gave me my shot. Other then that service is horrible, place is dirty. Paint chipping off the walls. No thank you!</Review>

<Review>This place is horrible. I actually called my Insurance to get them on the radar for removal. The girls are rude and they were conducting Covid testing with only a mask. The lady had no proper PPE. She was rude and so were the lady’s up front. All they did was talk Spanish and speak of patients information out loud. I seen someone accidentally put a dirty pen in the clean bin, the receptionist looked at the lady rolled her eyes and kept entering information. She don’t bother to re clean the pen and the lady was clearly sick. This place should get no stars and they actually need to hire professional experienced people to run this clinic.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I called back again reception answered no greeting immediately placed me on and after holding for 35 minutes without the receptionist coming back to the line and informing me that they will be with me shortly I gave up! This is ridiculous no customer service at all placed on hold 50 minutes without a greeting and then receptionist NEVER came back to the phone fire the receptionist!< /Text>

No stars for this place, they advertised 2 to 5 business days.
We went in for a COVID test a week ago and still haven’t been contacted back. When I attempted contacting them I was immediately put on hold and left there for an hour and a half and never spoken to. I’LL TAKE MY BUISNESS SOMEWHERE else in the future.<//text>

<Text>I attended this place to take a Covid 19 test because I saw in their website they take all insurances. I show up and they tell me they don’t take my insurance and charge me $170 for a test that later I come to find out is free in other places. I brought up to the girl in the from desk that the website reads “All insurances accepted” but they didn’t accept mine. They told me the results would be ready in 4-5 days. Today is the 8th day and I have been having to call them because they don’t bother calling and nothing.
Results still pending. Simple. DON’T use thins ridiculously low quality and very Poot customer service place.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I went for a Covid Test. Waiting time is about 2 hours which I don't mind i just needed to get this test done. Staff is just overwhelmed with this situation going on, understandable. Need organization in front desk. Ask symptoms of patients as they sign in sheet not after 1hour of waiting and then deciding to ask just to send them to the Emergency Room or also asking about insurance saw many waiting for as much or more then I did to be called just to inform them they didnt take their insurance. I did receive results in 3days after continously calling because everytime I called they placed me on hold or the call will drop for some reason. Other then that didnt have any issues with back staff.<//Review>

This doctor is awesome. Dr Tolles has treated my and my kids several times, at both locations. He takes the time to educate you about your condition. He writes scripts even for OTC meds. I have always felt much better after being treated, which I cannot say about other places that do nothing for you. Office is always clean and staff has been nice to us.</review>

If I could give zero stars I would. Staff is incredibly rude and they close whenever they want. I showed up at 5:20 walked through the doors that had a sign that states they close at 6 and walk up to the counter where there is a wrinkled piece of red paper that says closed taped to the counter. I say hi to the receptionist and she looks up and as I’m about to ask about the sign she cuts me off with a “we’re actually closed, not taking anymore patients we will open again at 7am” and then looks back down at her computer like I’m not even there. In all the times I’ve been there I’ve never been treated with courtesy not even by the doctors. The radiologist is one of the rudest people I’ve ever dealt with in the medical field. Also not to mention that every time I’ve been there they always open with something not working or not available and that I could back tomorrow before even asking why I’m there or even saying hello. I will never again show up there.<//Review>

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Their customer service is horrible. Most of the nurses are rude and seem to have no patience. They talk to the patients as if they're annoyed of working there.</Review>

My husband and I have been to this urgent care 4 times and each time we are very satisfied with the care and service that the medical team provides.  We've been treated by Margaret 2-3 times and she's both kind and knowledgeable.  She and the other service providers make us feel confident with the care we receive and that we're being heard, as if the plan of care is a joint effort which can be rare with some medical professionals.  The facility is nice as well as clean.<//Review>

<user>105203344860622568201<//user><Review>Took my son here on a Friday night, around 11:30p for an ear infection. There were a few other patients ahead of us but I felt we were all seen quickly, within 20 minutes. Staff was friendly and lobby was fine. Our visit with  the Dr. was quick and to the point, which I appreciate - especially at midnight! He diagnosed the infection, gave him some drops, wrote us the script and sent us on our way. Being on a basic PPO plan, ER visits cost a small fortune so I'm very thankful that we have a 24hr urgent care as a less expensive and quicker alternative.< /Review><name>Angie McPherson</name></record></dataset><record>

We were on vacation and were directed to this clinic from Palm Springs. They were quick, and efficient. The medical staff treated us and my daughter with kindness and respect. I don’t know why this place got such low ratings and negative reviews. I was nervous to go based on the ratings! Lesson learned. Just because one person has a bad experience doesn’t mean you will.< /review>

We are attended to faster than anywhere else at any urgent care. They are clean and friendly. I miss that the aren't open 24 hours anymore because it was a life saver taking my kids there at 3 or 4 am when they were infants and had high fevers but I love that they are open weekends and long hours anyway.</Text>

She told him to stop crying that he was over exaggerating the pain(4 year old). I was finishing up an emergency phone call and she was very disrespectful in telling me, she would leave the room because I was finishing up a call. I do not recommend this place at all. No professionalism for their work ethic.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We provided a service for Starks running some cable lines in his office. We did exactly what was requested but then once everything was done they changed their mind on the locations . They asked us to change them and we did, in good faith, expecting us to get paid for the work performed. They decided not to pay us. Up to this day Starks still owes us over $1000.00. I'm hoping that he doesn't cheat his patients the way he did us.</text>

This place was really fast. I was in and out in less than 45 minutes. The staff inside were really nice. The doctor was okay. He's just one of those guys who means business. You tell him how you feel and bam, you got meds to fix you up. MY only complaint is the girl who works at the front counter during the late evening. She has a very DRY personality. Poor girl, she is so pretty but would be even prettier is she smiled atleast once in a while. No hello or not even a smile. I definitely recommend this urgent care. Really fast service.<//Review>

Been here twice already and have received above excellent care. They saw me in less than 15 minutes versus the hrs I have waited at other urgent cares and answered all my answers and prescribed me all the right medication. Definitely going to be my place of choice from now on! Love Love Love Them!</review>

I understand is URGENT CARE and they need to treat patients accordingly to urgency. I was seen for a cut on my finger. Cut was bad, with pressure I was still bleeding.The nurse immediately advice to go in so the nurse and dr could see the cut. Since Dr. Was in a room with a pt, The nurse knock on door (it was emergency bleeding while putting pressure on my finger) Dr. saw it and I was immediately treated. I had 8 stitches, and while he was putting on stitches dr. (African Dr) advice to nurse to tell pts waiting will be a little longer because he had ergency of treating a pt.Thank you nurses as and Dr. For your services.< /Text>

<text>Spent 4 hours at this place from signing in to leaving with a prescription. The Dr was great and very professional, the staff however are rude and don't seem to care for the patients at all. They're not very knowledgable either. I kept getting different responses on how the billing works, they need to train their staff better. I will not be coming back to this urgent care, and I will not recommend this place to my family and friends.< /text>< gmapID>

Thankful for the care I received! I was visiting from Oregon and had a post surgery issue with my incision. I recieved a much needed suture to continue my family vacation and the entire staff was professional, kind, and worked with a sense of urgency to see all patients. Thank you so much and not all these reviews are applicable to an urgent care center. Sometimes you need to go to an ER or just deal with minor ailmaents and wait to see a primary care healthcare professional during regular hours. Thank you< /Review>

They say they take every insurance and just to get you in and then theyll say you owe x amount of money 😂 and your copays will be no less than $70... its pretty shady to do that to customers.
Specifically asked many times if they took tricare and if they were in network. And they said yes, repeatedly sent me 70 copays for my son which i thought was a little crazy but i did until one i called tricare and was like wth is going on ... and what do you know theyre a non network urgent care. ... i paid probably like 4 times for my son... and idk why i was stupid enough to keep going.  I had gone previously before myself never received any statements for my self...so i go again with a different insurance and what do you know i owe 70 from may of 2016. My insurance never sent me a copay statement from them and the urgent care never sent me a statement either. But randomly 3 years later i owe 70s with no statements nor any statements from the insurance ..... i really do think this urgent care needs to not receive patients if they do not take insurance< /review>

If possible I would put 0 STARS my experience at this clinic was horrible with Dr. Philip A Badufye (African Male) . He did not communicate well with me nor my wife he was rude to my daughter that was there to receive any type of treatment, my daughter wasn't given anything other than the treatments we were already giving her for a bug bite we are already aware that she had. Our concern was that her bites had blisters her leg had swollen and caused her to have headaches/Fevers the night before and where there solely for that reason to see what is the next step. He discharged her and didn't have any type of instructions or information on how to treat my daughter. He neglected in providing any actual documentation for me to take and simply had the nerve to tell me that if the instructions he was giving me verbally if I couldn't grasp a hold on to it on my mind. After going back and forth he did not provide me any instructions and wanted me to return the following day on a Sunday to receive paperwork. I am not from this area and I am leaving tomorrow. My Primary Doctors over at Kaiser Permanente instructed me to go to his office so I did that after I had an on call appointment with my doctor for the fevers blistering etc. I do not recommend this place to anyone and for the nurse trying to butt in simply she doesn't have any professional customer care.< /review>

If I could give negative stars here, I would. Doctors are not willing to listen to patients. Nurses and doctors are argumentative. I have had nothing but bad experience here. They diagnosed my child as having asthma at age 4, and she has never had prior breathing problems, gave her allergy meds, followed his diagnosis. Fast forward a moth later with countless allergy tests, no allergies, but a chest x-ray showed pneumonia. Hate coming here. Never again.</review>

Worst urgent care. The lady’s there are rude & seem like they really hate their job. The women before me was telling the front desk her symptoms and the lady was laughing at her & she did the same to me as well. Worst part is the so called doctor checks your ears & throat & writes a prescription. Been there 4 times & she did that all 4 times. Doctor Doesn’t tell you anything about your symptoms at all.<//text>

<Text>Horrible when I came in office  no one was in front of me. By the time they called me 5 people came in. I got called first and placed in room 6 with all rooms open. After 1 hour in back I ask staff if they forgot I was here. I seen all room doors closed from 1 -7. Staff informed me Dr starts at room 1. How in GOD'S green earth does that happen I am now 2 hours here at this place.. NEVER AGAINE!!!! I'd rather drive further to get better service and suffer the drive than let them make money off me...WOW!! Have to have an xray let's see how long that will take another 2 hours I assume... they said it will be quick. We'll see.<//Text>< Pictures>

One star is one star too much for this place.
The website states labs, xrays, etc but the doctor told me he could not do any testing at all just make observations.
Whats the point paying for am urgent care when they cant even write an antibodic?
Run test, etc. I would recommend paying any place else but here. Useless.....<//review>

<Review>I agree with several others that this urgent care facility deserves less than one star and should be avoided if at all possible. Arrived yesterday evening with my 10 yo son who was presenting with all the classic symptoms of strep throat. Once we checked in, we waited an hour and 15 minutes in the lobby before being pulled back into a room, where we then proceeded to wait another hour and 15 minutes to be seen by the doctor. Once the doctor arrived, he barely gave my son a once over (glanced in his ears, at his throat, & listened to his chest), before announcing that he had the flu. No strep test, no test to confirm the flu, nothing. Wrote us a prescription for Theraflu and sent us on our way. After arriving home, and my son complaining for another three hours that his throat was killing him, I decided to take him to the Eisenhower E.R. We were in and out within 30 minutes, with a diagnosis of...you guessed it...strep throat! Don't waste your time or resources on this urgent care facility. Take your business elsewhere.<//Review>< rating>

<Text>Horrible Urgent Care.  They told me that the doctor was out in the parking lot and would be right back.  30 minutes later, the doctor comes waltzing in having no idea about the term URGENT CARE while my son was bent over in pain with an inner ear infection.  I asked what took so long, and the doctor responded by saying that if your son is in so much pain, take him to the Emergency Room.  I then left without having the doctor even seeing my son.  They then proceeded to bill my insurance provider.  Terrible.  Do not go!< /Text>< user_id>

They refused to give me an ice bag, when my fever was at 103 Fahrenheit,  because supposedly my insurance wouldn't cover it. There were no patients when I was there and to top it all off they took 35 minutes just to give me a room and lay down. I would never recommend this place to anyone because without a doubt the employees at this place don't care about there job.</review>< pictures>

<text>We came for just a physical there was only one person in lobby and one in a room and still had to wait for over 45 minutes. The nurse that kept trying to do my daughter's eye exam had no idea how to do it and kept covering the letters with her pen which avoided my daughter from seeing it well.. Then she switched our rooms and kept waiting for another 30 minutes. We been here before and staff and Dr were really good. This visit definetly dissapointed me...< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1470358895444<//time><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

HORRIBLE experience!!!!!  One doctor on staff. He went into a room and spent over an hour there. They take your payment ahead of time cause they know you will be upset and want to leave. Please go somewhere else and don't waste your time or money here!!!!  This place is so bad I couldn't even give them 1 star!  Doctor finally came in for 3 minutes and argued with me. I walked out!< /review>

<Name>That-guy Desertboy<//Name><text>BEWARE!!!!! premier urgent care in indio is charging people for visits, physicals. Even though you have medical or IEHP. They changed me 50 for my daughters physical.  When I told them I didn't pay anything last time they said they were new policies that kicked in the beginning of this year. So I went ahead and call my insurance provider and was told ABSOLUTELY nothing has changed. That i should have not been charged anything. So they are now doing a full investigation,  seems I wasn't the only one that got scammed by these Fulkerson!</text></record>

I have been here before and like others didn’t know why they had such bad reviews because my experience here had been good until today! Took my little one in because she was running a fever and sore throat. Got there at approx 11:10. Got called back within 15 minutes. At 12:15 I started to think maybe they forgot about us, so I went out to check. One nurse tells me they didnt forget, doctor was standing next to her. I then say oh ok because Ive been in the room for almost an hour. One lady chimes in “we’re busy!” With attitude. I realize that just making sure no one forgot us cuz 45 min seem d excessive time to wait in back room and it was during lunch hour.  Doctor walks in 2min later with a nurse. First thing out of his mouth was “you said you’ve been back here for an hour?! Youve only been here total time a little over an hour!” The nurse chimes in “at your primary it would take you what? 3hours?!” Really? So professional. I proceed to give them the time they put me in the room and like I had mentioned it had been nearly an hour! Im no push over but for someone who might be, the doctor and nurse coming at someone like that can be intimidating. They got the wrong patient this time. We will not be back to this location again. Management needs to put doctor and nurses in check. The doctor took a total of about 30 sec with my child before issuing antibiotics and pain meds and that 30 seconds includes him trying to put me in my place. He didnt swab for strep. Literally looked at her ears and throat and insteucted the nurse to prescribe antibiotics and left the room. Beware of this place!!<//text>

Trash, I took my wife there at 3am on a Tusday morning to avoid paying a high ER copay but as soon as we got there the door was locked because someone "vomited", All of the staff looks and acts like they hate there job, when my wife did see the Nurse Practitioner she only want to treat her for an ear infection even thought my wife was coughing severely and was having trouble breathing. Not to mention the N.P was very rude and acted like she didnt want to help anyone and like she hated her job. My advice is if you can hold out until the morning for a good urgent care do so but if it's that bad just go to the emergency room because at least you qill get proper help there.</review>

The doctor's don't know what their doing. They ask you what do you think is wrong, then will take your opinion,and that'll be your diagnosis. Just go to the hospital or another urgent care .</Review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I was with my fiancee when she saw Mr. Bobby Asberry here.  He is a PA, not a medical doctor.  I'm not sure what word best describes him: incompetent, charlatan, or quack.  Not only was his demeanor wholly unprofessional, but he is incapable of simple diagnoses and answering simple questions.  He relies solely on tests run on machines for diagnosis, but cannot answer simple questions about error rates on test machines, etc.  At Kaiser, we saw two medical professionals with doctorates after Mister Asberry blew us off.  Both said his diagnosis was ridiculous.  Also treats people like ignorant children.  It would do him well to remember that many of his patients are more educated than him, and hiding behind a shield of ignorance and condescension makes him look more the fool.< /Review>< pics>

By far the worst urgent care I have ever attended. The staff is very unprofessional and rude. It took 2 hours just to be called and then put in a room to wait an additional hour to see the doctor. The doctor seemed clueless and wasn't helpful in a way or form. I don't recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

They need to learn how to talk to people on the phone there talking to people who are sick or have someone who is sick having a stuck up attitude with no willingness to help is not how a urgent care should sound<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The worst experience in my life was due to a wound on my right knee and I almost came out dead from there, the totally inhuman doctor can not find the explanation for what he did to me because, according to him, I explore the wound without any type of anesthesia and no matter how much I scream He let me not take so much pain I did not let go even though I told him to leave me to the point that I fainted 5 times in a chair then they sent my companion to the hospital emergency room and told him that my pressure was lowered because I saw blood I never got sick so much it was literal a nightmare I think I should see a place where the supposed doctors and nurses from that place are reported because then they wanted to wash their hands

(Original)
La peor experiencia en mi vida fui por una herida en la rodilla derecha y casi salgo muerta de ai el medico totalmente inhumano no encuentro la explicasion a lo que me hizo porq exploro segun el la herida sin ningun tipo de anestesia y por mas que grite que me dejara que no aguantaba tanto dolor no me solto apesar que le dije que me dejara hasta el punto que me desmalle 5 veces en una silla luego mandaron a mi acompañante a urgencias del hospital y le dijo que se me avia bajado la presion por ver sangre nunca me avian maltartado tanto fue literal una pesadilla pienso que deberia aver un lugar donde se denuncien alos supuestos medicos y enfermeras de ese lugar porq luego se quisieron lavar las manos</text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very bad attention they give you the wrong results and they don't even give you an explanation, they confuse everything and send you to quarantine with false results, first negative after 2 seconds positive, really very bad experience. I do not recommend them. If I could give them 0 stars I would give them.

Worst place to get anything. I had purchased a refrigerator and stove from them a few years ago and had an amazing experience. We went back and found out there was a change of ownership but went ahead and purchased a washer anyway. We had the worst experience ever. Worst delivery people, they couldn’t install it because the plumbing was allegedly not good. Plumbing was good before they came. Worst part I couldn’t check to make sure the washers purchased  actually worked because they didn’t install like they said they would. I was unable to cancel my order,, per their store policy. Will definitely never go back. The girl in charge said it wouldn’t make a difference if we never went back, so hopefully this review will.<//Review>

<Review>BUYERS BEWARE!! I bought a refrigerator from SJ Gomez Appliances @ 4166 Holt Blvd Montclair, CA  91763. I paid $350.00 for it they took about a week to deliver it when it was delivered it did not work! I called them and made them aware of the problem. I ask them if I could possibly have a different one because I was afraid that when the warranty was up in 90 days that it may not work and I would be out my money I told them I don’t want my money back.. I just want something that works! They said No you bought it as is…  But I explained to them you delivered it not working??? So they sent someone out to fix it. It worked for about 2 days and I complained again. They would not answer my calls I even went down to the store and they said that I would have to speak to the manager that was not in at the moment but leave my name and # and he would give me a call. I never received a call back from them. I went back to the store again spoke to the same girl I originally bought it from she said I’m sorry but you bought it as is .Told her but you sold me something that never worked! So I just want to let other people Not to buy anything from this appliance store because Now I am out a refrigerator and also my money.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1564166251825, 'text': 'Hello Mrs. Medina, we are very sorry to hear you were not satisfied with your purchase, but if we must say, that\'s not exactly how it happened. You purchased the refrigerator August 24th and it was delivered the very next day on August 25th, not a week later. When you needed a service, we fixed it. They are used appliances therefore we give a warranty in case anything goes wrong. We never said "no, you bought it as is" when you called, but we did mention it in person at the time of selling and showed you it is stated on the receipt before signing, that all products are final sale, no refunds or exchanges along with the 90 day warranty on mechanical parts and labor only. When you called again for a second time, we offered another service, but you did not want it. You were demanding your money back, which we could not do because of the store policy on refunds. Now, you did not come to the store, your husband did. He told one of our employees very kindly that he understood we could not refund the money, so he set up a second service. By the time you needed a third service, you called and very rudely demanded a refund again but aside from the store policy on refunds, you were not under warranty anymore. Every appliance gets checked before bringing it to the store to sell. Unfortunately, there is no possible way of knowing when something is going to break down. If you\'d like, please call the store and we can set up a service date; we will provide you with a discount and another 30 day warranty. Our sincere apologies, SJ GOMEZ APPLIANCES.'}</response>< GmapID>

I gave this company 4 stars just because we bought a fridge, washer and dryer for a good price. The sales associate was very kind and welcoming. The only issue we had is that is the washer and dryer were new than I don't under stand why within two days the washer began to give me a LF error code. It could have been that Maytag Bravo brand has had a lot of issues according to reading overall reviews. The only down fall was that they messed up so quick which was disappointing. I called them back and they understood my issue and actually gave us two newer, better and nicer washer and dryer with out any problems. Staff was friendly and the delivery men were kind as well. I'm very happy that they gave us new washer and dryer without any trouble or hesitation. So I would like to say thank you and I'm hoping everything is good with these new appliances. God Bless !<//review>

I was recommended by my parents and let me just say.. I am not dissapointed! They are always recommending friends and family and I will be doing so too. I bought a washer and dryer set with pedestals and a brand new Samsung fridge with tablet and Susy gave me an amazing deal! I'm extremely happy with my purchase! Blessings to them! Very nice and humble people.< /Text>

I havr had my fridge for over a year now. We thought that our fridge was a store model/dent & scratch. Totally Not! The freezer was our first issue. It started by not freezing anything. I had to throw out a bunch of meat because it defrosted without my knowing. I called them up and they did come out and replace the freon for free because we only had it about a month.  After that we had a problem with it frosting the freezer. Because I didn't leave anything in the freezer and used our second fridge instead it froze over to the point we couldn't open the drawer. I then defrosted the freezer aka turning it off for 24hrs. We took off the door to the freezer and discovered that the gasket for the freezer (The seal around the edge) on the bottom was more saggy that an old person..... paid $115 plus shipping to get a new one. Today the replace filter light was on. We have never had it hooked up to water to use the dispenser or ice maker.  I took out the filter, like they told me, and there was water in it, and put it back in, like they told me. The filter was used. It was at 0%. Now I'm afraid that we have a used fridge with no freezer capability.

I am glad to read about all the other people that have had issues.  I am adding my problems here so that other people know that this company is a rip-off.<//text>

<text>If i could I would give this a zero! Bought a washer for my parents and it was the worst experience, after a month mom asked me to call them to arrange for someone to come fix a part that had fallen they said they where not able to fix it since we didn't have receipt but I have my bank statement, still denied we bought It there. I should have went somewhere else . Places like this loose customers and soon to be bankrupt mark my words. If your going to have any type of bussines have an honest one. All my friends and family will know not to buy anything at this place.😑</text>< pics>

First off, these are USED appliances. This wasn't told to us until I asked, and the purchase was done and the transaction was already completed; that was real annoying.

After they installed,  the machines were ran and when it finished there was a load of disgusting black gunk in the washer. They were disgustingly dirty. It took me over 5 cycles to clean and sanitize them. Why did they not clean and sanitize them?? What kind of business is this? I regret the purchase and will never recommend this place to anyone.<//text>

<Text>I purchased a Refrigerator, front load washer and dryer and I have had nothing but problems with them since I purchased them. I have had so many service calls, and the problem is still going on. Now its down to the wire of there 90 day warranty and the issues are yet to be resolved. Although I love the appliances that I purchased, but the problems is way too much for me at this point. I have been doing more stressing then really enjoying the appliances.  Customer Service is amazing with regards to Susy, but them taking care of the problem/issues is totally different. They are not fixing the issue, they are just coming out and saying that they fixed it, or giving me an excuse as to why it's not working correctly. I am unhappy in that area.< /Text>< pictures>

I was looking for a samsung family hub fridge and found it in offer up for a good price, called the store and they were very helpful. There was no need for me to drive out to the store, they approved me over the phone and had the fridge deliver to Perris. Thank you sj gomez appliances plus the customer service was excellent. Will definitely get my washer and dryer with you guys.< /Review>

This place is the biggest scam. They sell you appliances that break down within 2 months and don't honor their warranty. The price they want to charge to fix their crap is more expensive than the price you paid for the  appliances to begin with. Save your money and spend it at an honest business.< /Text>

<text>IM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH MY EXPERIENCE HERE!!! I bought a brand new Samsung three door refrigerator with a matching stove and microwave, not only were the girls there great with their customer service, but they offered me a great bundle price since I was paying cash. They delivered that same day about 20 minutes from closing and said they didn't mind at all. They also installed everything. I felt so bad for the delivery guys but made sure to tip them really good since they too were very nice about the overtime lol. 4 months later, I brought my sister and her husband here since they needed a refrigerator and washer and dryer set. Again, great customer service and even greater deal! The brand new refrigerator and matching washer and dryer set they purchased cash came to a total of $5,300 and they took it home for $4,500 out the door delivered to Perris the following day. Definitely recommend this family owned business!</text><Name>Jakie Ojeda</Name>< pics>

Is amazing to experience what God is doing in maranatha, there are so many Departments where you can serve the Lord! The people there are super nice, if you visit then do not forget to stop by the Cafeteria and the Library❤️ May God continue blessing Pastor Erick!</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) How sad that you go to the upper marketa ayi your brothers are giving testimony as you dare to criticize a lady just because he did not want to hope that he is not a gentleman will be really a servant Of God who does not say the word perhaps you have my shoes maybe they are too big or maybe there are too many guys who do not say the word of God that we love the world that we are wise that we take the style of our eye Antea to look that we pray for the need of another person because I this day made me disappointed 😌

(Original)
Que triste que vayas ala marketa superior  ayi estén dando su testimonio sus hermanos como se atreve a criticada un Senora solo porque no quiso esperar que no es un caballero será de verdad un siervo De Dios  que no dice la palabra  acaso tienes tu mis zapatos quizás estén demasiado grandes o quizás estén demasiados chico que no dice la palabra De Dios que amemos al mundo  que seamos  sabios que saquemos la estilo de nuestro ojo Antea de mirar que oremos por la necesidad de otra persona pues yo este día me hicieron decepcionarme 😌</review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) I have been a member of this church since 2006 I graduated as leader of Family Groups
I like the way of preaching by Pastor José Luis Soto but if I tell you that it is an church that only asks for and asks for money or the disguise of the Tithe I can tell you that if you do not leave all your check there in this church and one day go through a need or go through a problem and seek the support of this church he regretted telling him that if they do not find a record that you have left more than half of your check they will not support you at all
That Sadness to make a profit with the gospel and the church use it for a business and not to support and help others without making a profit before.
but I know that God is fair and the day we give accounts to God if we have been like that God will tell us apart from my workers of Evil I do not know that God forgive them

(Original)
Yo He Sido miembro de Esta iglesia desde el año 2006 me gradué como líder de Grupos Familiares
Me Gusta la Forma de Predicar del  pastor José Luis Soto pero si les se decir que es una iglecia que solo pide y pide Dinero o sea el disfraz del Diezmo le puedo Decir que si usted no deja todo su cheque allí en esta iglecia y un Día pasa una necesidad o atraviesa algún problema y busca el apoyo de esta iglecia lamentó decirle que si no encuentran Récord que usted ha dejado más de la mitad de su cheque no le apoyarán en nada
Que Tristesa que se lucre así con el evangelio y la iglecia la usen para un negocio y no para Apoyar y ayudar al prójimo sin lucrar antes .!!
pero Se Que Dios es justo y el día que le entreguemos cuentas a Dios si hemos sido así Dios nos dirá apartados de mi obradores de Maldad no los conozco Que Dios los perdone<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a very active church, missionary of helping extremely poor children in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Haiti, it is also evangelized in prisons, we have a pastor who founded the beloved brother José Luis Soto a man full of love for others, a very nice family and from there our current pastor, Erick Soto, who puts his heart to move forward with the help of God and the many brothers who work hard so that each meeting is an exaltation to our Heavenly Father, I am a member of the church and Since I arrived I understood that God calls you and draws you to him to give you love, peace, healing, freedom and much support in the midst of The body of our Savior Jesus Christ
THE WORD OF GOD is not adulterated, we have people who love God and have prepared themselves to carry the legacy of salvation, COME, ACCOMPANY, I know that it is not easy to find a church full of God and his love, believe me I live it And I share it to you.
God bless you ♡ !!!

(Translated by Google) The pastor of this church is a scoundrel! Don't go here! Pure demands and always asking for money, it is a family business

Finally, the soto family are synonymous with corruption. I wouldn't be surprised if the pastor. Use this message to defend your corruption with a word-based message. In the end he will say that I am a demon and that he is the saint and victim that there are 100s of people against him.

(Original)
El pastor de esta iglesia es un sinverguenza!No vallan aqui! Puras demandas y siempre pidiendo dinero,es un negocio de la familia

Para acabar, la familia soto son sinonimo de corrupcion. No me asombraria que el pastor. use este mensaje para defender su corrupcion con un mensaje basado en la palabra. Al final va a decir que soy un demonio y que el es el santo y victima que hay 100s de personas contra el.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Good morning everyone, I tell everyone today what they say that the church is not the four walls there, the church of Jesus Christ is the Body of the people, that is the church we should keep, we are just going to congregate in a building. The people who attend this building are wrong with respects as preached by Pastor Jose Luis Soto. People are bad by nature and not the pastor or people who serve God. Make no mistake with the building, make mistakes with the people who are congregated to this building. It is not that I defend Pastor Soto and neither do I defend Christ, but I defend the beliefs of our Lord that are in the scriptures, which is the Bible itself.

Good morning everyone, I say today to all who commented that the church is not the four walls that is there, the church of Jesus Christ is the body of the people, that is the church that we save, we will only meet together in a building. People who go in this building are wrong with respects to what the pastor preaches Jose Luis Soto. People are evil by nature and not the pastor or the people who serve God. Make no mistake with the building, mistake with people who are congrados to this building. Not that I defend to defend Pastor Soto, nor Christ, if not defend the beliefs of our Lord that are in the scriptures, which is the Bible itself.

(Original)
Buenos dias a todos, les digo hoy a todos lo que comentan de que la iglesia no son las cuatro paredes que hay ahi, la iglesia de jesuscristo es el Cuerpo de las personas, esa es la iglesia que debemos guardar, nosotros vamos solo a congregarnos en un edificio. Las personas que asisten en este edificio estan equivocadas con respectos a lo predica el pastor Jose Luis Soto. Las personas son malas por naturaleza y no el pastor o las personas que sirve a Dios. No se equivoquen con el edificio, equivoquen con los personas que estan congrados a este edificio. No es que defiendo al Pastor Soto y tampoco defiendo a Cristo, si no defiendo las creencias de nuestro señor que estan en las escrituras, que es la Biblia misma.

<Review>First time was good, second visit was horrible food and service. One cook for bout 75 customers, food was late, received courtesy side of fries for the delay, ordered a $35 ribeye, and seemed as though it came straight from beach, ionized steak, so salty, not worth it, burnt burger buns, extra salty fries, everything so salty i swear, pizza is good, it's there strong point, id eat the pizza again nothing else plus beer. I'll go for pizza and beer.</Review>< Rating>

<review>First time visitor, all I can say is wow, this place is impressive and totally unexpected for this area. They have a huge outdoor seating area with a large stage for live band events. This place is packed on weekends and most evenings. The food presentation is modern and the quality is very good. Street parking is available and more around the back. If you are in this neck of the woods I would recommend a visit.< /review>< pictures>

The food was great! I had the bison burger and my buddy/co-worker/ boss had the inferno burger and he said it was bomb! Anyway the atmosphere was great with good ol country music in the background. I recommend it to anyone in Brawley, Ca. area.I'm coming from the morning valley area here for work. Good brews as well!</text>

<Review>This is the spot in Brawely for the best Americana style food and service in the Valley. Prefect portions of some of the tastiest food with a good selection of popular craft beers. I'll be headed back for more sooner rather than later and every chance I get.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I celebrated my PhD last night in this excellent restaurant. Well we passed a fantastic evening and the place was evidently one of the reasons for the fruitful evening. The crew  cooperated in a very nice manner, the meals were yummy and my friends were extremely  happy. We shall absolutely come back again for more events. Thank you very much.< /Text>

We like a lot hanging out. Last night we went to this magnificent place which friends told us about. We had a lovely time there with exceptional food and a professional crew and a great cook. We  added this restaurant in our list  and we shall surely return soon. We deeply recommend.< /text>

I don't usually get 5 Star reviews but the waiters are so cute and friendly. I always order the Margarita Pizza wherever I go and this one was truly unique and really good.  The crust of the pizza was of course wood fire with a little bit of charm nice and crispy and the sauce was rich and thick with a little bit of sweetness the cheese was average but what made this pizza really great was the whole basil leaves scattered on top after the pizza was cooked<//Text>

<rating>1</rating><review>Very slow service.  Had to ask for basics like silverware and napkins.  Printing on menu was unreadable in areas.  Appetizer was not hot when delivered to table.  The food orders were not delivered at the same time. i.e. some in the party received their food 10 minutes before others.  We're not going back to the Inferno.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

We came to this spot for a meeting. This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, it was a winning. The staff welcomed us with a smile and we had an excellent feeling. The food was just great. We enjoyed every moment and we will definitely return to this restaurant. We recommend this place to all.< /text>

<Review>I don't mean to be a hater but it kinda felt like a trendy hipster joint where it's more hype than actually really good food. The food was actually decent, just kinda left something to be desired in terms of portion size. Ordered 2 medium pizzas and easily polished them off between two people, $34 with extra cheese. Crust was burnt black on the bottom edges. Flavor all in all was decent though. I'd try it again but probably try something different than their pizza.</Review><Response>None<//Response><Time>1584190843174< /Time><user>106055283736965006790< /user>< pictures>

One of the servers Kenya goes out of her way to have great customer service, however there is another server (Irma) that if she is working I will find another place to eat. She really couldn't be bothered to take care of us.

I will keep trying with this place because the food is that good and Kenya is really great at making you feel well cared for.

I came back and changed my review  Kenya again took care of me and has exemplary service skills.<//Review>< pics>

We decided to give them another try. This visit was enjoyable the server was nice and on top of things. The chicken tenders were good. If any negatives the offices were a little higher than I would b think reasonable and I thought it was odd at how fast fries cooled down but that wasn't really a negative</Review>

Eh. Kinda pricey for Ok food. Wings are good though. Oh yea....their bathroom sucks. Pizza is somewhat their signature. I go here for business lunches. But if I want some home made in house style cooking, I take my guests to brownies down the block.</Text>

<Review>very clean and inviting spaces both indoor and out, but the food was just ok.  for the price I expected better pizza than what I received.  my side salad was excellent however.  the bartender was more into his phone than his clients, I had to flag him down for a water refill, a beer refill, and my tab.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80d75a686d0d6acd:0x259cf29d3f4f3890</gmapID></record>

The food was barely acceptable, but the fries were burnt. How you call yourselves Artisan when Jose, juan and consuelo from the street corner with 0 cillinary education is beyond me but... The service was absolute dreck. 20 bux for a burger and you cant afford a napkin? Plastic fork? The servers were aloof.  Not once did someone ask us how we were doing.  We drove almost 2 hours to try this place and we had to bus our own table. The attitude of the servers changes of you are inside or out on the patio. THEY ONLY GOT THE SECOND STAR BECAUSE of THE KARAOKE Guy.  He made it worth the 2 hr ride in each direction.  If it werent for the Karaoke 1 star.  Horrible food, horrible service saved by Karaoke. Dont bother.<//text>

Grow up. It takes one bad comment to ruin the reputation of ANY establishment.  Please keep your personal issues to yourself.  It's hard enough what the family had gone thru.

Food was great, but they had lost their liquor license when we were in town. Between  that and the fact that the place was deserted when we arrived, we almost went somewhere else to eat... but the food was great!</Text>

<review>We walked out. I’m giving 1 star because that’s the minimum and the restaurant seemed like a neat place, atmosphere was cool n relaxed. First time out west, and in CA. We were traveling with a 3 other couples. Two opted for the Jack in the Box, but we wanted something more tasty.  We chose to sit outside, felt great out.  A waiter seated us and gave us menus. He introduced himself as Jesus, and was polite but when asked about some items on the menu, he had no idea. He took our appetizer and drink order. We asked about a few different beers also, he stated he didn’t know about them because he didn’t drink. We decided to order root beers and 1 lemonade. When he returned with our drinks, he sat them down and told us we could order at the bar inside if we wanted anything else. As he was telling us this, I was sipping my root beer. It tasted like carbonated water. The rest of my group was asking why he couldn’t take our order as I said, “okay, but our root beer is terrible! The syrup needs to be changed out because you can only taste carbonated water; so do we just give these back to you?” He proceeded to tell us we would have to take it back to the bar. We were like, WHAT??? He smiled, nodded and walked away. So we did too. We sat the terrible drinks down and left. We went to Jack in the Box and I’m happy to report, service was fast and friendly. I feel like at the least he could have taken the drinks and tried to make it right. Oh well, they lost out. Sad.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x80d75a686d0d6acd:0x259cf29d3f4f3890</GmapID><Rate>1<//Rate><Time>1540440031210< /Time>< Response>

<text>Friendly staff, checked on us often, nice selection of beers and wine, if you're interested in a salad there's a number to choose from, as well as burgers. I selected blackened salmon with seasoned rice and asparagus, delicious.
Out door sitting available, during our lunch, noticed they were able to accommodate large groups of people. My family enjoyed their eating experience.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80d75a686d0d6acd:0x259cf29d3f4f3890< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>Had a reservation for 7pm didn’t get our table till 7:15 no biggy they’re busy. Ordered at 7:20 food didn’t get put in front of us until 8:30pm. Meanwhile about eight walk-in To go orders after us get food and walk out and multiple dine in tables order get food eat and leave and I still didn’t have my food. I don’t know if it’s good or not yet will eat for dinner tomorrow. But I do know that 5000+ traveling mechanics will be getting the word not to eat here after work. We do not have the time to waste an hour and a half for food when we are living out of a suitcase and working 12hour days to maintain the infrastructure of the country.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d75a686d0d6acd:0x259cf29d3f4f3890</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<user>115693940420422725666<//user><review>I liked the whole feel of the restraunt. The brick walls and glass doors with the low lighting inside made it feel like you were dining in the city. You completely forget you're in a small desert town. The outdoor bar is a plus, the whole environment is relaxed and friendly. But the food was disappointing for the price. I had the rib eye steak with fries; the steak was juicy, but bland. The fries were too salty. My husband had the inferno burger and even he felt like it lacked flavor. The service was great, but food is overpriced for what they give you.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Great atmosphere! Really enjoyed the menu selection.  One of our plates came out late because they were out of the original order and they were quick to fix it and offer a dessert to make up for the wait.  Great service!<//review>

The pizza was amazing, but the burgers were yummy and a huge helping...brought half of it home...the appies were great as well...the service was prompt and helpful...have made a great place and a limited menu work well.  Went there with a group of friends for a birthday and everyone was delighted.  Good luck..</review>

Apart from one speaker not functioning on the patio, leaving out on guitar on the “the boys are back in town” harmonies, this place is awesome!!! The jalapeño from the burger still lingers on my palate. We’re from Sweden, so in what seems like a pretty silent area this was an amazing surprise. Just go there already.</text>

The atmosphere is great and the drinks are good; just don't eat here. Salmon was overcooked and dry; a serving of asparagus was 4 pieces; asked for no salad, we got 2; and the BBQ brisket sandwich was half inedible fatty cut and less than a tablespoon of bbq sauce. Servers weren't very friendly either and the place was not busy, they only had 2 tables when we arrived.< /review>

<review>Slow service. It was lunch time but only one server. Order for food or drink wasnt taken for 20 min after seating. Food came at the 50 min mark of seating. Food was ok. Ordered the swiss hamburger. Ordered medium rare. Came over done. And everything was peppered way to much. Even the fries.
Interior is very nice and looks like quite a place to visit for games on the weekend.
Good selection of drinks.
Could have just been an off day. Worth another shot when I'm back in town.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80d75a686d0d6acd:0x259cf29d3f4f3890<//gmapID></record>

< Review>
I'm always a critique when it comes to pizza being that it's one of my favorite when placed on the dining table. So with that being said I would have to say that this place is unique with quality and taste, and the service is without a doubt great. Now you'll get some reviews here bashing the service this place provides, but unless you're self-centered and expect the servers to be at your instant command at the snap your fingers without considering that are others around you that are just as hungry, I would have to say the service is exceptionally great!! Otherwise naysayers get a time machine and go back to the 18th century.< /Review>

Server was quick to get us our drinks, the California Creamin Ale is delicious. I ordered the Bison Burger medium, my girlfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich. The food took a little over 35 minutes to get to the table. The bison burger was well done on the dry side but it made up for it with the accompaniments; didn't return it as I was hungry. The pulled pork seemed to have been done adequately, the sandwich didn't have excessive BBQ and tasted of smoke; I'd say quite authentic. Overall the ambiance is very relaxed and the decor is a nice rustic. The servers do their job well, the kitchen was a little slow. I'd come back and try some of the other items on the menu.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Super slow service needs to figure out something to increase customer satisfaction. It shouldn't take an hour for a wrap to arrive at my table. Very disappointed. Don't recommend. Save yourself the trouble and go to Chabelas in brawley instead.< /review>

< Review>
Haven't wasted my time going back in 2 years. My first experience was fish and chips, I asked if I could order poutine instead of regular fries which they said yes. I get the "poutine" and it's the most disgusting thing I've put in my mouth ( I ate 1 fry)so I asked if I could just have my regular fries instead. They never brought regular fries out and charged me for everything then when I asked for my fries again was told it was going to be a seperate charge. Didn't go back for quite a while then a friend wanted to eat there while visiting the area so we went and decided to sit on patio. Big mistake. The wait staff was out there goofing around with a bunch of kids on lunch from the high school. We sat there for about 10-15 minutes waiting for someone to come get our order. They didn't so my friend suggest we go for Chinese food and I think he took the menu in his words "for his wasted time".</Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Vazgen was amazing.  I have never had a “good” experience with a collision shop or even the dealership.  UNTIL NOW!  They fixed my car, even cleaned the lights up for me and kept me in the loop the entire time.   I never worried and my car looks better than when I bought it!  They are amazing!  Highly recommend.  I hope I never get hit again, but if so, I won’t take it anywhere else.  Like I said,  it was actually a good experience!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_name>

Fantastic to work with. Communicated well. Ready on time. Hopefully I won't need more collision repair in the future but if I do I'll go to them!<//Text>

I highly recommend Caliber Collision! Troy and John were very professional, and able to repair my car after an accident. They provided me with frequent updates on the car, and worked hard to get the car back to me quickly.  Now, my car looks even better than it did before my accident! When the repairs were completed, they were able to drop my car off to me at my house, and return my rental car for me. And an added bonus- my car came back very clean and professionally detailed. Overall great customer service!< /Text>

It’s been tough time for me especially when I had my accident.I didn’t feel good to drive and I wanted it fix already. After talking to Hayk, he gave me full details about my vehicle, reassuring me that my car will come out brand new. Through out the week, I’ve gotten phone calls about the updates of my car and just like that my car was finished way before the time I was told. I’ve never been so happy and felt awesome that Hayk kept his word and really took care of me. Shows me how committed he is to the people that walk through that door and makes sure they get the best.<//Text>

You ever go to the mall and park away from the other vehicles? I usually do.... until recently!

Someone had let a shopping cart loose in the parking lot and ended up hitting my vehicle full force. The shopping cart had created multiple dents unfortunately.

Not even a year into owning the vehicle and this occurred.

I reached out Caliber Collision and spoke with Hayk!  He reassured me that my vehicle would be repaired to factory floor quality.

One of my favorite things about Hayk is that he could relate to how I felt. No one likes to have a shopping cart kiss your car... and Hayk understood that!< /Text>

<review>Vazgen Is the BEST!!! I sent in an email after hours and he called me 5 minutes later to answer my question! They did such a great job on my car after it was hit by another driver. They immediately made me feel at ease that my car was in the best hands - and it was. Can’t thank them enough and will always recommend this company :)</review>< pics>

The body work was done well and on time however they had a problem submitting the paperwork to my insurance company. Unfortunately, they didn't bother to check when they hadn't gotten paid, almost 3 weeks after the work was done.  I think their bookkeeper should have been checking with State Farm after just a week of no activity...</Text>

As a tourist in Santa Monica, the last thing you want is a flat tire.
I called up Salerno; they said they could take me right away and repair the tire if it was repairable.
In and out with a repaired tire in less than 15 minutes -- for a price I didn't think possible in Santa Monica. And courteous to boot!

I had the most pleasant experience I've ever had when having to have a car repaired.  Leo Safaryan was professional and pleasant and uber-efficient.  He kept me updated the entire process (only 2.5 days), and it was so easy to drop it off, get a ride to the rental car place, and then pick it up. And it looks brand new!  Cannot recommend them enough.<//Review>

I have an old Lexus and while parked at a Grocery store or Library, someone back into my car causing a squeaky noise when you made a turn.

I reached out to Sam who is Office Manager for a consultation this morning. He took a look and asked me how I wanted to proceed. Since this was an old car and I did not feel spending $1,200 for repair work would not make sense. I just asked him if he could pull out the bent fender and re-attached the loose liner. He did it graciously and did not charge me a dime for it even after I insisted to pay something for his efforts.

This type of customer relation is certainly rare in this day and age and I wanted to take this opportunity to give him the credit he deserves. Thanks again Sam for all your help and kind gesture.

I brought my Audi in to fix some body damage. Everything electronic was functional at this time. They fixed the body damage and I can't honestly say anything was wrong with the work I received. However, a month later when I got the car back the radio, backup camera, side view mirrors, Bluetooth, motorized seat adjusters, and right side speakers all no longer worked. I called up the shop and they said to bring it back in for a "factory reset" and it should only take a few days. I called repetitively and got the same answer "it will be done tomorrow". I CALLED FOR THREE MONTHS! I would call every day and receive the same terrible customer service. I have a text thread with Sam Key the manager from 2/11/2016 to 5/17/2016 saying it will be done "tomorrow"...every single day!

I finally got the car back and nothing worked! They took 3 months and fixed absolutely nothing! I have made many efforts to contact them since, and have only been ignored.

I wouldn't recommend this shop to my worst enemy...<//Review>< UserId.>

Wonderful clean park with lots of open space, large playground, fields, tables, BBQ space, and clean bathrooms. Parking not too bad.

Get there early if you want to reserve a table since it is now first come first serve.< /review>

< review>
We took a break at Dinosaur Park for the kids after riding our bikes and e-scooters on the Aliso Creek bike trail and the place was nice and clean. I like that there is a smaller separate playground area for young toddlers and a bigger separate area for older kids. All the playground equipment looked well-maintained and the kids had fun playing on the slides, swing, and the sand.

The only bad thing about this place was that all the bathrooms were closed (locked) and one had to use a porta-potty located far off (probably due to COVID-19).

Also, despite signs asking parents and kids to wear face coverings, about 95% of the people here did not wear any masks (kids & adults).

During normal circumstances, this park would be a great place for both adults and kids to relax and play.</review>

< Review>
Great park to go to. Tables you can rsvp through the city for bday party's ect. Public restrooms, water fountains. Plenty of fields for soccer, baseball, football. Great selection of playground equipment for kids under 2 and  above. Also have water statues that shoot water in summer time which is cool too. There's also a skate park connected to the parking lot that's popular.< /Review>

<Text>Just a great all around park, everytime I've been there, there's kids and parents so it's not a dead park, and it just feels full. It has a slide, a bridge, a little place under the bridge, another tiny playground for littler kids, and more in the main place. Oh it also has long tables for parties and that's why we've been there mostly.< /Text>< Rate>

This place is amazing! There's like three stories worth of outdoor climbing equipment and swings and tires and climbing structures. It's clean and there's bathrooms nearby. It's next to a top quality community center and skate park. What's not to love!< /text>

The park is fun but not great if you have a little one in a stroller and an older kid. The park is divided into two levels and the upper level access for strollers is out of the way and doesn't allow for great visibility if your older kid goes from one level to another. Depending on how closely you like toy watch your kids this can be an issue. The kids love it though.<//review>

Amazing kids park with Dino skeleton, geology themes and fossils to play amongst. Like the multiple levels to play on and path throughout. Skatepark right near by great for kids as well shallow parts for carving or scootering around in.< /text>

This park is fun for older kids. This is not a place where you can just sit and watch. There are so many blind spots, you have to constantly be moving to keep an eye on them.</review>

<Review>Perfect park for a 2 and a 5 year olds. There are 4 swings. Directions to the park are a little bit odd so you have to go through the community and try to spot a playground. There are several options for shade and also water fountains decorated as turtles. Overall we have spent a couple of hours here without getting bored.< /Review>< Pics>

My son and I love this place.  There's so much to do. The water turtles, the giant slides,  fossils, diggers, and the giant whale fossil... it's all so cool. There's layers of park fun.  It was a little hard to find. It's kind of like a hidden gem.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.<//text>

Much of the play area is covered. There are shady places to sit and watch the kids play. This is a park I will go back to with the kids. They liked it. One draw back for some may be the walk from the parking area to the play area. It's about 100 yards, uphill. I use a cane and had to stop several times. We'll take a picnic lunch next time and throw out a blanket to sit on and eat. Lovely park. (Sorry.

I came here with a group of parents and kids. I was impressed by the wide range of structures the children had access to. My only complaint is that it is designed in a way in which there are different levels. An upper level with the jungle gym and a lower lever focused more on sand play. This set up makes it difficult if you are trying to keep an eye on more than one young child because there is not a decent line of sight across the playground.< /Text>

So fun, safely located (far from the street), and there's a good bathroom! I loved it when I only had 1 little kid and 1 baby. However, it's too difficult to manage with 3 young kids. It's 2 levels and you can't see much of the other from whichever one you're on. And there's a water play feature made of cement, just the right height to be climbed onto and very fun, but a slippery and messy hazard if an adult isn't right there next to it. I wish they would just put a little fence around the water area. And because kids can get out of sight and lost easily, I only go if I have another adult to bring with me.<//review>

<review>A great park! We have a 5yo, 3yo, and 2yo, so keeping track of them at this park is my major drawback with this park. Kids love it, though - even if it is a stressful time for Mom, as I try to keep track of all three in a sprawling playground!</review></record>

<Review>One of the best parks in the area. plenty of variety for anything kids want to play, with several different size slides and different swings with varying intensity, as well as a dog area with doggie bags and plenty of grass and field to play futbol or other field sports. Only 4 stars because of kind of far parking area but would've done 4.5 if possible. Great place with fun for everyone.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dce8ce2aeb19db:0xc64b88b5ec38e30e</gmap_id>< Name>

This prehistoric, fossil themed park is perfect for kids of all ages. There are tunnels, bridges, and stairs for exploring. A cave with fossil prints and tracks to examine. The upper playground has climbing challenges and steep slide for adventurous older kids. Lower playground has a very cool whale fossil made for climbing, a safari jeep for pretend play, and sand pits with digging tools.</text>

It is a nice park, but the design makes it harder than usual to keep eyes on your little one.<//review>

The Sandy area is great for digging and building sand castles (the rock turtles provide water) lots of seating area, 2 soccer fields, and plenty of green space for playing/chilling in the grass.

This is a fun park for the kids, although it can get too crowded when nearby schools bring their classes out. Sometimes older kids do not watch out for younger ones and they plow right over them, but the facilities are well kept and I have noticed they have inspections of equipment often.
It is also a good place to walk or jog around.<//text>

<Review>Every year we come to the 4 th. Of July celebration. And I will keep coming. Just the best..... Only one thing some swing was broken and the musical panel too. I'm suggesting to the city of Laguna hills to walk around the park and fix whatever needs to be done.  My 2 girls loooove this park<//Review>< Pictures>

I loved living in this mobile home park, years ago. When the manager's we're retired police officers. They we're wonderful. Then my husband died (fire) in mobile home. He sat. On purpose. I couldn't afford to pay rent in my own. Now I'm in Elk Grove mobile home park. Miss the friends I made there. 💓<//Text>

Driving around the community, it was clean and easy to get around. I didn't really see anyone and it was super quiet. I'm not sure if its always like that but I thought the community was very nice.</Text>

Since the new manager has come it has definitely gotten slightly better, at first i loved it, then i realized the tweakers screaming at all hours of the night and the drugged up people walking around like crazy zombies talking to themselves. I lived there for 2 and half years. the pools closed most of the year which sucks. The people there are not all bad but there is a specific park busy body that is a snitch and if your not perfect she will tell on you. Shes old and has a lot of tweaker traffic that goes through her house so who knows what shes about. in 2 and a half years there has been at least 4 park managers. Jack is the newest on and hes great, very helpful and is cleaning up that place so well. the only bad thing is that he doesn't live on site so he doesn't experience the tweakers and so he doesn't do anything about them. HOPEFULLY in time Jack will get that place in better shape. I will say out off all of the parks in Sacramento i have been too this one is the best looking and it has a gate which is very appealing . It is very quiet other then the teenagers during summer roaming around being loud and the tweakers screaming and fighting with themselves and others. no one bothers you there which is nice. I am just glad to be out of there. They need to build a play ground for the kids instead of the basket ball court that rarely gets used. I can guarantee that the playground would get more use.<//text>

< review>
I used to really love this park. Was Colony Mobile Home Park, now is Hometown America Colonial
Estates. They put up an entrance gate then it became 'Estates'.
We had a very friendly community, but our residents got older, died or moved away.
Take a 'short putt' inside and count the amount of empty lots and 'for sale signs' and ask yourself:
WHY ? ? ?
The clubhouse is very well kept...But it seems to not be in much use..
I myself am very disappointed as to the present attitude and concern from the residents and site
management of the health of the community.
I have lived here approx. 20 years. I and my wife as well of most of my neighbors are disabled or are
'Dirt Poor'. It is a struggle to tolerate some of the 'attitude' going on...Perhaps it is ME or the 'sign of the times'...The 'buck($)' seems to be the question and answer, I have neither...</review>

<Review>I love it here! Getting an appointment is easy they really go the extra mile to work around your schedule. They are so knowledgable about hair types and styles, and have a wide array of products.  It's also nice that they have a wide selection of hair to choose from in a ton of different colors on site. I've had my hair done here several times and the quality is unmatched.The style is beautifully done and it lasts a long time, they braid fast too. I had long mini box braids done, my natural hair is very long and it took 7 hours it's usually much longer. The prices are very reasonable for the quality you are getting as well.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I had the best experience at this salon. My hair was braided in a french braid singles combo today. The salon is connected to the beauty supply store. The prices are very reasonable. Their goal is to make sure every customer walks out happy and satisfied with their work. I am very pleased and will return.<//Text>

<Text>WTF!  I saw all the great reviews for this place so I decided to give a try since my regular braid stylist is no longer available.  I made an appointment and washed my hair, showed up on time.   The lady there I guess it's Marie I don't know... took one look at my hair and refused to braid.  she claimed she didn't feel comfortable cuz my edges are thin.   I told her my is braided all the time.  she still refused.  So now I'm stuck at 530pm on a Saturday with messed up hair!!
just to prove to that lady my hair is Beautiful when cornrowed.. I have attached a previous pic of my lovely braids done by a real Professional!<//Text>< Name>

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY BRAIDS!!! Best braiding shop in town. Marie Louise & her daughter Jen were so professional & welcoming!! This is my new braiding place. You can’t go wrong with them.
If you haven’t booked with them before do so A.S.A.P I promise you won’t regret it! Great conversation, reminds me of the hair salon vibes when I was younger. Good professional service is hard to find & THEY DEFINITELY HAVE IT!! Best money spent & best braids of my life. I showed them a picture of what I wanted & they executed to the T!!
MANY MANY THANKS TO THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DUO!!!! ❤️❤️👍🏽<//review>

<Review>This is the only place I go to get my single braids done. They are neat, fast, and reliable. Unlike many other braiding salons, they are very consistent which gives me comfort knowing my braids will look nice every time. The hair they use along with adding light grease while braiding helps the style last longer and gives the braids a beautiful shine. If you want perfect single braids done quickly and professionally, give them a call!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I went to this place with high hopes to get my hair braided for the first time. When I went to the salon, there were only one girl. And  I told her that this is my first time and I want to get a quote and I have no idea about braiding. I was hoping to get some ideas and to know what would look good on me. Then she gave me a number to call, so I did, and left a voice msg, never got back to me. So disappointed.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808566d7ddf442b1:0xe3d59e81cbb38d01< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Been going here since my daughter was 3 yrs old she's almost 10. They have done about 6 of my family's heads. Both of my girls go there now. A very loving family. I relocated out of the area but since we only need our hair done once every few months we make the 2 hour drive out there to her shop.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

They are a bit.... Overly paranoid, for a store that sells dollar items But, this is probably because its in the hood so.... I would have gave 4 stars but they stoped selling Pro Clubs for $2.50 and this was just last year. Shoot me a black L long sleeve and I got you on a star. Shh... I won't tell nobody!< /Text>

Greatest dollar store I've ever been in. The daughter of the owner, Michelle, very cool, nice person, honest. They have damn near everything you can think of. Everything is not a dollar, but the price is always reasonable for the item and the quality. I walk each and every isle carefully. Takes me at least a hour. Shop-a-holics enjoy.<//text>

One of my favorite dollar stores, they have a lot of things that you can't find at the 99 cent store. Give it a try things are a little more than a buck but if you need it it's worth it.</Text>

I was very upset to see alive fishes in this shop. It's awful actually. So beautiful fishes are jailed in small jars with almost no water and all dirty. The one third of them are dead already, others are waiting to be bought or more likely to die soon. It's terrible guys. Please stop treat animals like this. You are not a pet shop.< /text>

The staff specifically the cashiers, the treatment is lousy, they check your bags and think that you are going to steal, the worst thing is that they are compatriots and work for a Chinese, that is not the problem but the way in which they treat you.

They have good and practical things, but the treatment should be better.

<Review>Mangold had been managing our properties for years. When my mother developed dementia they took excellent and compassionate care of her. They made sure her mortgage was paid, kept track of her insurance and taxes, kept track of her. I was living far away and Mangold gave me peace of mind. After she passed one of the staff who became close to her came to the funeral and comforted me. I continued the management of the properties she left me to them. They take the same great care of me and they did of her. One of my homes needed extensive work after she passed and they have been overseeing the project. I'm still distant so having Mangold take care of everything and keeping me informed has been a blessing. They are like family and I couldn't keep my properties without them.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

We have been renting for 10 years on the peninsula and Mangold has by far been the most professional, diligent, responsive, and pleasant. Really grateful we have found them!</review>

We have been using Mangold to manage our properties for years and they've been a godsend. We were local to the area but I'm now out of town and if not for Mangold, I wouldn't be able to hold on to the properties. The rental income I receive is my retirement and Mangold allows me to forget I even have rental properties. They allow me to live a peaceful life. The tenants are well taken care of, the properties are well maintained and Craig has been incredibly informative over the course of Covid.</review>

<text>I lived in one of their apartments for a year. They worked to get me into it fast since I had to start working right away. Then when I would have a minor issue, they would dispatch someone that same morning. But the best thing is, I got my full security deposit back. I didn’t damage the apartment and used their suggested apartment cleaners. Given the cleaners were like 300$ for a small apartment, but my deposit was definitely more than that with California rent.<//text>< pics>

I have lived in a mangold apartment property for over 10 years and  have attended me very well. They were able to extend my rent payments and were able to provide a lot of help during the COVID-19 pandemic. During all of my years of living on the property, I have never had people assist me as helpful as Jackson Trapin and Jacqueline. You guys are the best.< /text>

I have been Mangold PM for a variety of property management and maintenance issues for almost two years now.  I find them to be an extremely prompt, courteous, and cost effective solution for me being a property owner a state away from his rental units.  Their range of expertise and services make them my one-stop-shop for my property management needs.</review>

I have had my eyes on this property for a few years now and finally thanks to you and your hard work it is now a reality. It means a lot to me that I will soon live in peace with my wife and enjoy each day from this point on. Also I would like to thank you for your pleasant attitude when answering my many questions and your patience of my many phone calls, including your co-workers Alex and Francisco, your manager should be very, very proud of your dedication and service you provide on a daily basis< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The people at Mangold Property Management really are unsung heroes in many respects. I want to thank them for their quick response on the recent plumbing issues in my property.  They have been great to both me and the tenant’s.  By the way, the landscaping and the rental lot look really good. Thanks to your staff!</review>

First, our family wishes yours a very Merry Christmas and wonderful remainder of the holiday season.  We’ve been very lucky to live in the Monterey area for the past 18 months, and having direct contact with you when issues arose at the house sets you apart from your contemporaries (and competitors).  Our sincerest thanks for everything!</Review>

I've been a tenant for over 3 years now, and have never had any problems with my apartment. I'm lucky enough to live in a building in a quiet neighborhood, and none of my neighbors have ever been a problem. There have been occasional maintenance issues - a burst pipe or inconsistent heat - but the Mangold PM facilities crew always fixes the problems in no time at all.   I do wish the apartment complex were entirely non-smoking, although I don’t expect that it will be.  And I do love the ivy and replanting that’s been going on, it is a great improvement.<//Text>

Haha! I just would love to see the condition of the units the people with higher ratings left. Simple, yet important, safety items were missed. Even when I had a gentlemen here to inspect the unit before I moved in and specifically pointed out the items to his face there was no concern to call the maintenence department to have this resolved for me. I just can't see a 4 or 5 star rating when there is no concern or care involved, but don't worry the rent is always paid on time!<//review>

I've lived in a Mangold managed home for many years. I wouldn't move anywhere because this place is always quiet, clean, and has very responsible staff. I am a very satisfied tenant!<//Text>

<Review>Worst experience I have ever had with any property mangament company!!!! From the rental property to the customer service this business is by far the worst business.

I have only been in this rental property house for 6 days and I have numerous incidents and issues already.

This high end rental house ($4400 per month) was advertised as "move in ready" which clearly was not move in ready. The day I moved in I found out the refrigerator was broken and a new one was to be delivered the next day. I drove 4 hours to get here and I had groceries that needed to be refrigerated. I ended up throwing 3 large bags of food away. The communication was very poor from Mangold Property Management. If they knew the refrigerator was broken the day before I came they could have called/emailed me and informed me that a the refrigerator was broken, a new one was coming in a couple of days and not to pack any perishable items for there is no place to store them. I could have given my 3 bags of food away rather than packing it and letting it spoil.

Besides the broken refrigerator there was no microwave in the kitchen. 6 days ago when I signed my lease I was told a microwave should be coming but they had no clue when it is suppose to get here. 6 days later and still no word on the microwave.

Dennis the owner of Mangold Property also told me that the place would have a full clean from top to bottom before we moved in. That was not the case. In the master bathroom, old urine was clearly visible around the bottom base of the toilet. The carpets were so old and the smell was so bad it made me nauseous. We called Mangold Property and they sent someone to wash the carpet which was nice, but this should have been taken care of before we moved in.

The bedrooms are all upstairs and the 2 bedrooms where my kids sleep are connected to an outdoor balcony. The balcony doors in both bedrooms do not lock which seem like a serious safety issue. My kids are 3 and 5 and I do not want them having free access to a 2nd story balcony. I temporarily solved this issue by placing both of their dressers in front of the balcony door preventing the door from swinging open.

There were also these old armoires that are broken, wobbly, and tilting heavily to one side that could have been a disaster if it fell. They weren't attached to the wall and the most of the pieces were all broken. The have removed one of them to the garage and their still is one more upstairs that needs to be removed.

The oven had a broken knob so we could not turn the oven on. STEVE from the Mangold Property was sent to my rental to do an initial inspection today. He figured that we would not use the griddle as often so he removed that knob and placed it where the broken oven knob was. The knobs have different numbers on them so that quick fix did not work. It actually just filled the house with gas. I mentioned to him that the whole house smelled like gas now and he replied, "I don't smell anything". I complained as well as my 5 year old that we smelled gas around the whole house. I opened all the windows and told him he needs to call a professional to take a look at the oven. Steve was very RUDE and argumentative. It seemed like he became more frustrated as we pointed out everything that we found was an issue in the house. He left 1/2 way through the inspection and SLAMMED the front door! Steve is the most unprofessional employee I have ever met. Clearly I was also upset because of the gas situation in the house so he said I'll come back another time. I told Steve that I do not want him ever returning to my house and to send some one else over to do the initial inspection. Now I need to clear my schedule out again to meet another employee from the company when ALL of this should have been done before we moved in.

There are rat droppings everywhere in this house now! I need to get out of here. This is DISGUSTING!<//Review><time>1524793583880</time>< user_id>

Terrible. If you know what you're looking for, super fantastic. Know what to look for, and be specific. Don't expect service if you don't know what you're looking for. They're just sales people. They know nothing besides the script they are taught. Rude customer service if they can't sell you something. The loss prevention team is the nicest of them all. They're at least attentive.</review>

Great! Awesome customer service. I bought a new laptop with Office 365 and it is great. Id forgotten my MS Office 365 card with the reg key at the counter, and they were nice enough to put it in the store safe for me until I came back to pick it up. Great service, Best Buy. I recommend most definately.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Completely disappointed with their Total Tech Service package. I paid $200 for annual support and due to the pandemic they would not provide me service for most of the year.
While that part is understandable, but the fact that they did not extend the contract for the amount of months when they could not provide service or provide me with a refund is beyond unacceptable!!!!.

On top of that they had the NERVE to charge my CC for another year of service without my consent. ( and we are still in a pandemic!!)
I am addressing this issue with my CC company but was just informed that Best Buy is fighting it.

They have lost a great customer over this !!!
I’m also sharing my experience with friends , family, colleagues,  neighbors etc. directly and on my social media !</text>< pictures>

I usually try to support this place as much as I can. But the shelves are very empty on most of the stuff I usually go there for. It reminds me of fry's 2 years ago. It's sad. Usually really enjoy this store and the employees. Hope it gets better soon.<//Text>

Customer service is always great. And I love that when you buy insurance its with them. So I can go directly to them to get it fixed or replaced. No hassle 👌 just sweet and quick.</review>

Needed shoes.  The clerks were excellent in helping me.  Ordered what I was interested in. Order arrived in promised time.  Had to return one pair.   No problem.   I was not looking forward to shopping in these times, but I have changed my mind.  Also on my way out I found pajama style that I had been looking for for sometime.< /Review>

I reserved a spot in their shop 2 months out to get the car audio fixed that was making noises due to poor installation. I took a day off work and drove 45 min to this location. When I got their the manager ( I don't know her name but she was working today 2/5/21 at 9AM) sent me away and told me to go to another Best Buy?! This has never happened nor is suppose to. I am very disappointed in the customer service being promoted their by a Rude and unqualified manager. BEST BUY CAR AUDIO IS THE WORST!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Affirmed why I prefer online shopping.
Customer Specialist were overwhelmed by last minute shoppers. I had no business being there. Asked for assistance was told it might be me or it might be someone else who will help you. Another 9 mins.
later, asked for assistance. This specialist at least asked what we wanted. Offered a solution to our request.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Curbside pick up is actually parking lot pick up with wait times averaging 15-30 minutes. This is my third time and it really is pointless.  Stock was incorrect online so they had to order and that was a week late. Amazon would have been much faster, hence all my business for electronic needs is going to Amazon at this rate.</text>< Pictures>

Best Buy Fairfield has 1 person doing pickups. It’s Christmas week and 1 person is working??!! I was the only person in line and Roy simply couldn’t even hand me my order that was directly behind them. SMH definitely will shop elsewhere next time!< /review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Nice clean store. Staff is friendly for the most part. Like any bussniess though you have some that should probably keep the help wanted ads near by or stay subscribed to those employment groups on social media. My experience comes from a younger guy that's was very "is this shift over, I can't wait to go hang out" to the point the $1700 drone I had already had him pull for me to purchase and the other $600 worth of items I was trying to get info on was all cancelled. Once I told him "hey look bud, I'm spending quite a bit of money here at least enough to have your attention for 10 mins to help me pick this Motherboard" he came around and after a few excuses was barely to the task at hand. My main complaints has to do more with the company and their overall policies and conduct than the store it's self.< /review>< pictures>

Very positive experience! They have a good system during the pandemic. We needed an ink cartridge. They got it for us and took it to the register while we waited in line and then they rang it up. It was all very efficient and everyone was very friendly too.</Text>

I bought a expensive dvd player 175$ broke 6 weeks later they would not stand behind the product. . best buy is over priced and does not have a good return policy! Not to mention they sell broken stuff as open box insted of shipping back to the distributer place sucks !! Go else were unless you want to end up in a bad situation!!</Review>

Best Buy is falling victim to the times just as most retailers are.   They have reduced inventory but seem to be doing a good job of trying to keep up.   Masks are necessary but at least they are open< /review>

<Review>This review isn't for the store itself, but for an outstanding employee - Carlo! He is so professional and understanding.  We had an issue with a fridge we purchased and he did everything he could to help us.  He deserves a raise!  He gives you his undivided attention when it's your turn and is super calm and informative.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Entry limited to the mall entrance. You must have a scheduled appointment. I walked up (no appointment) looking for a portable vacuum. I was allowed to enter after door person called to housewares and was told to let me in if I already had an item in mind to buy (which I did). I found what I needed and ordered it for pick up. Nice, fast experience.<//Review>

<review>I had preordered the pixel 4a and had a pickup date on Aug 20. Aug 20 rolled around and the date changed to Aug 24th without any notification from best buy. Aug 24th came and then there was no date for pick up and no notification from best buy. I reached out to customer support and they said they had no idea when the pick up order could be fulfilled and that there was nothing they could do. They didn't make an effort at all to help fix this or provide any real answers or solutions</review>< Pictures>

<review>Very helpful associate.  I appreciated him putting the protective shield on my phone and assisting me with wireless headphones for the gym. The only down side was I waited a long time to get help. I saw at least 3 others doing nothing. He came straight over to me after helping another customer and asked how he could help.</review>< Pics>

Heres a quick tip. Best Buy price matches same products that are  on Amazon. So go check this place out get your gadgets and not wait for it to be shipped to you. Also helps the local economy.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I went inside Best Buy at the mall. The security guard greeted me as usually. I found my product immediately. The product was competitively priced. It is centrally located between the mall and Chick Filet. The lines were very short. I have no idea how they can afford to pay all those employees to stand around though.< /Review>< date>

I am constantly pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service at this location. I have bought 3 TV'S in the last year and every time the staff was very helpful.  My favorite part about this location is their selection of PC gaming hardware. I needed a power supply same day and was shocked they had such a wide selection available in store.< /Text>

They wouldn't sell the floor model, even though the warehouse was empty and the 2 models had been discontinued. Also found the prices were almost $150 more than at Amazon. Still, picked up a Chromecast for our semi smart TV. So not a total bust.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Went in to purchase a replacement laptop, wasn't super excited about it! The young man who helped us was extremely knowledgeable  and didn't have an agenda to push any particular product. He gave us the information we needed and gave us the time and space to make a decision. I definitely appreciated that!<//Review>

It's like any best buy store. It's just sad because I was shopping for fridges and obviously I had to look inside these units but what I saw was boxes/wrappings of other merchandise without the actual item in it. The store is losing money on these thieves and that's just idk 😕... they should invest in hiring more personnel for theft prevention.<//Review>

<Date>1562057202959</Date><text>Today I went into Best Buy looking for a new headset. However, I lost my wallet during my trip and not realizing when or where I lost track of it. I had backtracked everywhere around the mall. I had my wallet returned by a Best Buy customer who had given it to an employee. What made this an extremely memorable experience was  Best Buy member named Latrice. She was extremely kind and made finding my wallet an easy process and helped me keep my hopes up. Her kindness was genuine and inspiring and I'm glad I lost my wallet for the moment because it caused our interaction. After getting my wallet back the purchase was very quick and the cashier, Melissa, was kind as well.< /text><resp>None< /resp><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pictures>

Fair Warning: It is REALLY uncomfortably warm in the store so remove any jackets or outerwear if you're going here.

The store itself is an average Best Buy with typical employees of which most are friendly. I should note that there are some employees that truly stood out in terms of knowing the products they are attempting to sell. Otherwise, go here with a clear image in mind of what you want since it is a hit or miss on whether you'll find a helpful salesperson.</Text>

I went looking for a turntable for my records. Only two to choose from they were out of merchandise. I went to their record department looking at records not what it used to be. They hardly had any records at all to choose from. I didn't buy anything. But the store was clean and the people were friendly. I will go there again sometime.<//Review>

This tech retail giant is like all the other Best Buys you have visited. The store is well kept, bathrooms are clean, and employees are friendly and approachable. When you want to know more about a brand or product, they are well versed in helping a person who doesn't understand how it all works.< /Review>

The store is very clean and organized. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The prices are very fair.  The parking lot is well lit at night. Plenty of free parking. Handicap parking & easy access available.

I was very impressed.  As soon as I walked into the store,  I guess they noticed my look of confusion and offered to help. Which I gladly accepted. They saved me at least 30 minutes.  And the young man answered all my questions.
Thank you, Best Buy.<//Review>

Jorge, I hope I have his name right I have to say is the best manager I have ever met in any store period. I really hope he is as good to his employees as he is to his customers if so God bless you! I know Geek Squad totally ruined my mother's brand new Dell Computer as well as making her buy things she did not need 2000$ computer in the trash thanks to Geek Squad employee no longer works there but I must clarify the new employees seem to know what they are doing and have great customer service. Pretty cool store!<//Review>

Just some advice, if stick to the deep dish or the original thin crust pizza. Cauliflower dough if that's your thing as well... However... DO NOT try the stuffed crust or wheat style dough; you'll be disappointed.<//Text>

<text>Love Best Buy's sales staff. No pressure. Lots of information. Purchased new washer machine on behalf of mother. Flip side... the team that delivered the washer "tested" the machine after they hooked it up and said it was working fine just because the lights came on. My mom couldn't get it to work. Called the service # and was told they couldn't come out to fix the machine or troubleshoot the problem but only replace the machine.  Service tech came out only to discover the delivery crew forgot to turn the water back on.  Mom lost a week without a washer because of sloppy installation.<//text><GmapID>0x808514212898ed69:0x4f3e3676ab431cd4</GmapID>< Rating>

<rate>4</rate><review>I like that you're always greeted when you come in.  I was asked if I needed help right then and there . I said I was going to appliances and she said she would send someone to meet me there immediately.  There was no roaming around trying to find someone to help. Best buy addressed that issue by addressing it right up front as you come in.  I was met by Mike the first day and by Gregory the second day. They were both very knowledgeable very helpful very understanding and very patient.  If they did not know something or we're not sure of it they would look it up they did not just BS me with I think this or I think that.  I wasn't very happy before with BestBuy because of the lack of assistance but these guys have changed my mind and I may buy several appliances and things from them.<//review></record>

Had radio install by Mike who is the manager of the car stereo install Department. Mike did an excellent and quick job installing my radio. He also took the time to give me an orientation to the radio once he was finished. Overall I would highly recommend Mike at Best Buy 4 car installation of a radio.<//Review>

Had the best customer service experience.  While upgrading my children's phones Amanda was patient and very helpful even when I didn't have the answers right away.   Couldn't be more pleased with her service.  If only everyone was as patient, polite, helpful and knowledgeable as she was everyone's shopping experience would be much better.   I highly recommend if you need to upgrade your phone look for Amanda in the phone department.<//Text>

<Text>I went to purchase 1 item and decided to browse in the home theater department for something else and the associate that assisted me was very helpful and honest in his goal to help. I did not purchase anything from the department based on his recommendation and I found that refreshing because had he not guided me the way he did I would have spent $200 more than I wanted to.

Very good customer service. Came to purchase an especific product but, after getting help from one of the associates who provided a very good information regarding the product I was interested in, my interest changed. I ended out buying a different brand, different size, different color, well a totally different product altogether.
Thank you for all the help, support and knowledge so we the customers can maximize the power of shopping and obtain a good product from our invested time.</Text>

Great experience and place to go when you need different electronic devices. They have a wide range to choose from, from Tv's to DVD's all the way to dishwashers to wash machines and even games, and so much more. I highly recommend it< /text>

I like that their staff is knowledgeable and not fighting each other for commissions so I know I'm getting the best guidance and answers to my questions. We even buy our phones here because we consistently get better deals than direct from our carrier.< /Text>< Rate>

<review>Like any other Best Buy. It's a hit or miss whether or not the associates are going to be busy. Best bet (pun intended) do most of your research prior to visiting the store and if you have a question, you will likely find someone to assist.
Received a gift card and found the redemption process quite nice. Biggest pain was actually locating the bar code on my phone. Once found, smooth sailing.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808514212898ed69:0x4f3e3676ab431cd4</Gmap_id>< Pics>

Went in to find a new phone. Salesman was knowledgeable and very helpful. Actually saved me money! I believe his name was Chris that helped us in the mobile department.  Thx so much. 2nd phone I purchased from best buy. I like them more than the Verizon across the street.</review>

< Review>
This is a really good place, if you know exactly what you're getting. In my experience, it's fine because I go in for a PC part, price match, and leave happily. The problem is when people who aren't too tech savvy go. My brother got scammed into an overpriced 300 dollar monitor that we had to go back and return. For the same price, he got two much better monitors.</Review>

Benjamin was extremely helpful, as was the Apple Consultant. I believe her name was Sarah, but not 100% sure. Most satisfying Best Buy experience overall, hands down. No pressure, friendly, helpful and saved me from purchasing something that was unnecessary. Helped explain how the device is purchased a week before would suffice.< /Review>

If you know what you're looking for and can find it on your own, then I guess this place is okay. If you need to ask a technical question, don't bother. These employees have very basic knowledge on technical issues. The Geek Squad is unimpressive in my book.<//review>

This is a nice,  clean store.  It's right on Stevens Creek Blvd , at the corner of Santana Row.  You can't miss it.   Best buy is two story: first floor has all current tech (games,  movies,  laptops,  phones,  etc), and second floor has like life techs (fridges, stoves,  etc).  Traffic is pretty relaxed.   Im not sure how busy it gets when traffic picks up.   But everytime I go,  it's relaxed.   Workers are quick to all if you need assistance.   Plenty of parking too<//review>

<Review>The customer service is outstanding!  We purchased phones for my parents. RJ and Amanda, customer service reps,  patiently explained all the smartphone features to my new user parents.  My parents have come in repeatedly for help and they are always kind and helpful.  We are and will continue to be repeat customers because of their great customer service.  Thanks and we’ll be seeing you again.< /Review>< date>

best buy is working hard to get business back. lots of open electronics to play with before purchase, and easy price matching online prices straight from your phone. stop ordering electronics online! get them today for the same price!</text>

< Review>
I went in to get just a simple computer for school, I was looking around the 300-450$ range and nothing to great. I was approached by a gentleman I believe his name was Tre. (Very polite and knowledgeable) He asked me quite a bit of questions and it turned out the computer I went in there for wasn’t going to be enough for what I had to do. So he walked me to a few different options and we finally found a computer that would suite my needs but it was way out of my price range. He offered their Best Buy credit card and I was able to get approved for the cost of the computer and more. So we went ahead and went with the computer and got me a bunch of accessories that I needed as well including the Microsoft office package. I never really liked going into any Best Buy but this changed my mind 100%. Next time anyone goes in, I advise you to go to Tre! Very knowledgeable employee!< /Review>

<Text>Had to return an item that had obviously been opened. The screen protector had an alcohol wipe that was even completely dried out.

The folks at customer service didnt apologize and acted like the whole scenario was my own fault. I had to make an additional trip in to town because of Best Buy's lack of interest in doing their job. Then was greeted with dead customer service.< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating>< gmap_id>

My mom bought a Samsung S8 to replace her old S4 Mini. RJ, the AT&T representative  provided exceptional customer service. He  advised that she can keep the same number by switching from AT&T postpaid to AT&T prepaid and referred us to the AT&T store upstairs to accomplish that.</text>

<text>If I could give this place a zero star, I would. This place is a complete joke. Terrible customer service, management is rude and unprofessional. I will never shop at any Best Buy ever again especially this Fairfield location. Buyer beware, they sell broken products in their packaging and will refuse to exchange the product for a working product of which you paid for. If you buy anything there, I suggest you ask for them to open it up to check it before you leave.<//text>< pics>

<text>my go to store whenever i need to buy a pair of earphones. i always grab the cheapest one since i always break them. today, i saw one that was $9.99 and grabbed it as soon as i saw the price. when i got to the checkout, i was told that it was $19.99. i walked the cashier to the sign saying it was $9.99 and he just told me that it was for a different product. i was waiting for him to honor the price since it was fully stocked by one of their employee. he asked me of i will still purchase the product and didn't even apologize that it was misplaced by their store, or offered that they will honor the mistake they made. i decided to just leave and to never come back. poor customer service. smh. i would understand if it was one product that was misplaced but a full display is a different thing. you don't expect your customers to check every single one of the tags to make sure that they are grabbing the right product, especially since their price tags' fonts are so tiny.</text>< Pictures>

This retail store is lazy and disengaging. They employ a lot of people that stands around gossiping and ignoring the customers. When asked for assist they either give U a short answer, point out the direction and then walk away or continue thier conversations with other workers<//Review>

<Review>I walked in to try to purchase a lenovo charger for my lap top but instead walked out with a Chrome book. LOL. It was no fault of the sales rep or the Assistant Manager; it was a choice given that I was looking for something more lighter to work with.
I was exceptionally pleased with the product knowledge I received from Ben, whose knowledge and understanding the need of convenience, along with functionality enabled me to  feel comfort!
I would recommend coming down, and asking questions to get the products that you need to make your everyday more convenient! :)< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Went to get a laptop serviced and was told it would be better just to get a new one.Okay if I wanted a new one I would just buy it. I wasnt trying to put more computer waste in the landfill and not feeling someone telling me how to spend my money either.Manager also before I explained what I was there for made me stand in line eventho they weren't busy.After he finally let me speak hes like here let me have this girl talk to you...so I had to explain all over again to have her tell me the same thing. Ok Best Buy I know you like to upsale but I really only wanted to see if the laptop would work.< /Review>

BUYER BEWARE IF DOING BUSINESS WITH BEST BUY IN FAIRFIELD!!!!

Julia was the person who helped my mother and I to purchase a computer ... tower, keyboard and monitor ... and did not give one thought to whether or not what she was saying was true, nor did Best Buy deliver on what Julia promised, which consequently caused us an abundance of wasted time and money!

When I called Best Buy to handle the situation all I received was a nightmare negotiating their voicemail system which took me 15 minutes and 5 calls to get the manager of the Fairfield Best Buy on the phone to only listen to apologies.

Not one word of correcting the sales person, not one word of "how may we serve you so you continue to do business with us" and not one word of we will handle the situation so it never happens again.

Personally, I will never do business with Best Buy again.<//text>

<text>This place is under stock in my opinion, customer service lacks a lot. It's the only best buy in town, so I can't really say if this issue happens at other locations.<//text>< pics>

<name>Jason Morrow</name>< Review>
I went in to get a specific (and very cheap) tv wall mount I saw that the store had in stock while shopping online. When the associate in the tv department asked what I needed, I showed him the item on my phone, and he immediately said that the store didn't have any in stock and that I should buy the one right next to me that costs about 5 times as much! It was only after I repeatedly told him it was in stock and showed him the app that he looked it up and went to get it "from the back". Pretty poor customer service.<//Review>

<review>A typical best buy. 4 stars because they are always not the best buy! They are pricey. Good place to take a look,  then order what you want online. Their digital camera selection was minimal when I took a look today. Over half of their digital camera hands-on station was empty. Sad face.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>If only their return policy was fair I'd give them a 5 star review. I had bought a shield protector for my phone the geek department installed it no problems at first but the way the phone shield was placed caused it to crack. I went there to have it replaced or have my money back but the worker said I'd have to call the manufacturer of zagg shield glass to have them replace it or go to their website and ask for a request for a replacement. Its a bunch of b.s.  why wont they just fix it or replace or have my money back its a scam i wish i never spent $52.00 on the phone shield they even charge you for having it installed  i was so mad that i decided to never shop there again i hope with a scam like that they're going to be out of business.

My family bought a open box tv from this store and all they did was wrap in in this thin bubble wrap and did not tell us what to do to prevent us from harming the tv in any way and when we got home and plugged it in and it was damaged. We went back and they told us we messed it up and shouldn't have layed it down. One of the workers taunted us as we were leaving as if we were not paying customers. Not only is that unprofessional for a worker to do but it is disrespectful. It wouldn't be as bad if they would have been respectful but with that going on I question if they have someone watching over what they do. It's unacceptable how they treated my family and I feel everyone can learn from our experience.< /Review>

It seems like the employees were friendly but the management was literally yelling at the Geek Squad guys while they were trying to help me. Extremely unprofessional. This was a while ago, but it's really turned me off of them completely. Jose is the worst general manager ever.< /Text>< Pictures>

Waited in line 20 minutes to do a return with 1 customer service representative and 6 other employees standing around.  Justin, the store manager watched me and and others as the line grew and did nothing about it.  Poor customer service all around.</Text>

<review>It was my first time in Best Buy Solano Town Center in a Fairfield and to be honest, I was impressed. I came with the idea of what kind of TV I wanted and I walked out with a better TV. The 50 inch Ultra 4K HD Hisense is amazing! Plus it was on sale!. The associate that helped me was very friendly. I forgot his name but he asked me what kind of app I watched (HBO, Netflix). I was very happy with my purchase and he helped me load the TV in my car.< /review><rating>5<//rating>< pictures>

Purchased a Samsung 65" TV.  Was baited and switched by salesman to last years model.  When I discovered this, Best Buy tried to sell me this years model and a much higher price.  I asked for refund in total.  They are only willing to refund the TV and NOT the delivery and pickup of the old TV.  They will not refund until 3 days after the TV is picked up and they will not give me a date for pick-up.  Best Buy is NOT A CUSTOMER CARE company.  They have angered me beyond  belief.  I would not buy another item from them.  I will tell everyone I know how they have treated me.  THis company will never make it.  THey will go under with this type of customer care.</text>

< review>
I have written a review before, maybe on yelp or some other website. I don't remember. The first review I wrote was about four people plus myself waiting in line until an associate, who was flirting with the front door security, finally acknowledged us and decided to ring us up. I forgot her name, but I wrote it down on my other review. After she began to assist us, she kept using her walkie talkie to make obscene comments regarding her sex life and the person she was speaking with. Now I love Best Buy. I have always shopped at Best Buy since I lived in Phoenix. But I've never experienced this type of behavior that I experienced at Fairfield Solano Mall.

So to continue my second review about this specific store at Solano Mall. I came in to make an exchange. I stood in line for about 20 mins while two associates were assisting another customer. One of the associates then left while the other called a lead/supervisor. She came over and took another 10 mins to assess the situation. The other associate finally decided to help me which only took about 5 mins. There have also been many situations where I wanted help on the floor but there was no one to help. They were either huddled by security or walking in circles. I think I may start shopping on amazon to avoid these situations!</review>

<Review>Haven't had a bad experience here. Definitely shop around to price out what you're looking for prior to coming in, the prices usually aren't great.</Review>< user>

Store is clean but make SURE you get help from the folks in the auto bay for auto needs. The folks inside dont necessarily have any knowledge.<//Text>

< Review>
I like Best Buy in general.I shop here a lot and even used to be a Premier Silver Reward Zone member.The branch at Fairfield, CA (at Solano Mall) used to be great, but I think it is getting worse.Because I shop a lot, I get a lot of rewards certificate and shop kick points.Earlier I tried to claim my points and the cashier didn't know how to apply my RZ certificate along with my ShopKick credits toward my purchase. Another employee came and tried, but couldn't figure out how, they called a female manager and cancelled the transaction to start over. they tried again and failed. Called the store manager and I was told to come back the following day (WHY IN THE EARTH SHOULD I HAVE TO WAIT A DAY AND COME BACK? I'VE DONE THIS SAME EXACT ROUTINE BEFORE SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE). Oh, BTW, the manager did not even try to resolve the issue, he just concluded that it will not work because his cashier, who admitted doesn't know how to do it because she's never done it before, could not get it to work. So I left the store and browsed my phone for "shopkick instructions". Apparently, the cashier is supposed to process it as "e-gift card". SO I CAME BACK TO THE STORE, and tried to get a different cashier so I could show the instruction on how to do their job from the shopkick website, but the cashier I got pretty much ran her MOUTH for 10 minutes (while the first cashier sits there) telling me they could not help me, WITHOUT even trying the instructions that I was showing them...This is just horrible service...This makes me not want to come back to that store ever again....I hope you lose more dissatisfied customers...Next time take care of the very few DVD/Blu Ray movie buyers because pretty soon they will all vanish and switch to just renting from NetFlix or Red Box, like how people do not buy music CDs anymore and only buy MP3 music from the net or itunes. I knew I should've bought that DVD I wanted to buy from walmart or target instead and applied my shopkick credit towards Old Navy...Just think about Circuit City and Blockbuster...I hope a few people continue to shop at your store..<//Review>

(Translated by Google) As a buyer of household appliances, I am pleased that the staff attends you with kindness whatever you are looking for, and if not, they do a search to see where they can find it. Yah was open today that on these dates because not many are open so very well attended without much to say ..
