<response>None</response><text>Outstanding service, from initial phone call all the way through seeing my junk leave in the back of their truck!

This was my first time using a service to haul away items that we have collected over the years, in particular an old hot tub someone gave us that we never installed or used.....from 16 years ago! However, I had all kinds of different items that just needed to go.

James arrived on time and helped me assess and prioritize what I wanted gone the most. Sometimes it was more than he suggested, other times it was less, yet he gave me a very reasonable quote by tallying as we went along.

James and his crew arrived the next day, as scheduled (it was too much to do on the first day). While James was cutting up that hot tub, Steve and Dominic helped and picked up all the other items we had discussed. We still had space left, so I pointed out a few other items I wanted gone, James gave an on the spot quote, and we went for it!

Junk180 is the only company I will call for the next batch of junk that needs to go! They are truly professional, on time, thorough and reasonable. A fantastic service company!!!!< /text>< Date>

<Text>Not to my knowledge and despite what the guy said I found no fees for hauling on the website.  I figured it was a somewhat casual operation although presented as professional from the website to the truck itself.  I also figured there might be some haggling involved since I found no fee structure.  I only had a handful of items for removal and not particularly large ones.  When the guy quoted $180! I said no way; neither was $140 in my ballpark budget.  I said $70 was my limit because there was so little.  In fact, after haggling some more, we agreed on $80 and the guy took it all out in a shopping cart!  So I guess I would say they are flexible.  The pick-up guy was personable and we conversed amiably while I entered my credit card information on his phone.  So if you don't find the fee structure on the website, don't worry;   you can read my review here HAHAHAHAH!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Junk180 is so dependable, the service is exceptional and pricing is really affordable. We’ve used them a few times and the owner is always responsive and his team is super friendly and professional. Amazing local business to support!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>On two separate occasions I contacted Junk180 when I needed to have unwanted furniture and junk removed from the house I was selling. I made my appointments on-line, was able to select a convenient two-hour window, and got an immediate confirmation with instructions. The workers called me when they were on their way, giving an accurate ETA. They came, made a quick estimate, and cleared the stuff away. Everything worked really smoothly. Yes, it would be cheaper to haul things to the dump myself. But not that much cheaper, and they don't junk everything... they do recycling and reuse as well, so not as much goes into the landfill. And I didn't have to take the valuable time, rent a truck for larger items, etc. Wonderful service, run with a high degree of professionalism.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<time>1622143405493< /time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>The owner of Junk180 was quick to respond to my request for a quote— and the price was very competitive based on many quotes I received from other businesses which appeared to not be as legit as Junk180. He gave me a time window for same day pickup and his driver, Joey, called me with a 30-minute heads-up. He arrived with a partner right when he said he would. Was very friendly and professional. The guys carefully and efficiently loaded my items onto the truck after which I paid and was issued an invoice/receipt through text. No hassle, no fuss. These guys are very fair and do exactly what they say they’re going to do. Very professional.< /Text>< pictures>

Service was super-prompt, efficient, went beyond expectations tidying up. The property looked BETTER than better than before they started (apart from the debris they removed).  Billing handled smoothly and efficiently.  Great Value.  they will take anything except hazardous stuff like paint.< /Text>

This service was great! The quote was reasonable and lower than any other service I used. They arrived during the arrival window, and were in and out in 10 minutes. I would definitely use JUNK180 again if I needed to get rid of anything I couldn't fit in my bins.</Text>

<review>I accidentally used the wrong zip code and they were sent to the wrong address but it was no problem for them to come our correct location and they were still early for our appointment. They picked up all the junk and trash I had in my garage and backyard. The process was quick and simple. I will definitely use this service again. Thank you!</review>< Pictures>

I'm new at leaving reviews, so hopefully you're not reading my same review 3X!  But I just wanted to mention that Junk180 really helped us out when a few of our trees blew over during the recent heavy winds.  As in the past, they were professional, friendly and quick to get things cleaned up for us!  We will DEFINITELY continue to use Junk180 in the future!<//text>

Steve was friendly, helpful and on time. I scheduled same day at 358pm for a 4-6pm window surprised they could do it on such short notice! The garbage company said they would take my items and then didn't and Junk180 saved the day. Wish it would have been a bit cheaper but wouldn't we all! Will certainly use them again!< /Review>

I got a call right within the window that was scheduled that they were on their way, and were right on time. They showed up and were polite and professional, and prices were very agreeable! Junk was removed quickly and efficiently, and they really surprised me by cleaning up the area after the junk was removed! I was surprised just how pleasant a process having junk removed by this company was! Friendly, enjoyable, great value and efficient! 10/10 for me!< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Junk180 was very professional from first contact.  Collected estimates from 3-5 junk removal companies for hottub removal. I recvd a prompt return call, quote, then email confirmation of estimate provided. The price was reasonable but not the lowest quote received. All communications were by text, email & phone. James/the owner & Techs: Steve & Dominic acted with professionalism start to finish. They were respectful of our property, completing the job quick and left our backyard cleaner than they found it. We are very pleased and will use, and,  recommend Junk180 for all future junk removal needs. Great experience, thanks again Junk180!< /review>< Pics>

The easiest junk removal experience ever. I have tried several avenues to rid of junk and from now on I am only going to be using JUNK 180 with James. He was prompt, professional and helpful. I added a couple of items last minute and he accepted them without any hesitation. He broke down the furniture to makes sure i got my money's worth. Thank you!</review>

Were prompt, wore masks and quote was right on. They removed everything quickly, professionally and cleanly. The result is amazing! They swept and made sure we were happy.

Highly recommended! Good price, great service.< /text>< name>

Had an amazing experience with JUNK180! I submitted a quote request via yelp and they were the most responsive. They were able to give me an accurate soft quote from a few snapshots I sent them of the items I wanted hauled from debris to a king size mattress. They were able to come out the next day! Highly recommended them for any junk removal in the Bay Area!< /Review>

Junk 180 did a fantastic job and their pricing was fair!  I called and they were able to schedule a visit for the next day.  Great customer service.  They even did an extra side job for me that was not in the original scope of work - also for a fair price.  Very happy with their service and we will use them again!<//text>

<Review>I never thought I could be as excited about junk removal as I am today, thanks to Junk 180. For years I’ve wanted to dispose of my hot tub and various other unused items in my home (exercise equipment, broken furniture, etc), but didn’t know who to call or who to trust. I was referred to this company from a recommendation I saw on Facebook and as soon as I spoke with James, I felt very comfortable and at ease. In terms of response times, it was immediate-something that is important to me. James was informative, detailed and friendly. Not only was James able to answer all of my questions, he was available to dispose of the items immediately. I was able to move some of the items outside on my own, but not all of them. James took care of all the heavy lifting!  Honestly, given the items disposed of, including a hot tub, the price was on point and very reasonable. Price is important to me but so is customer service and Junk 180 provides it all. I highly recommend this company and I don’t give reviews often.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I looked around for quotes to remove an old mattress, a broken down desk and some large shipping boxes. James at Junk 180 got back to me with a quote quickly at a great price. Excellent communication and quick service. I could even pay my invoice online. The whole process was seamless and super convenient. I would choose Junk 180 for any and all of my junk hauling needs in the future.<//review>

We agreed that he would come to the house to view the scope of the work.   He was exceptionally clear about his protocol: he sent a text message to confirm the appt (which I then accepted) AND he gave me a phone call when he was about 30 minutes out.  He arrived within the timeframe he told me.  He gave me an acceptable bid and we agreed on a date for the work to be done.

Again, the day before a text message arrived to confirm and a phone call on the day, when he was 30 minutes out.

He and his assistant, Zack, were *exceptional* workers.  They did everything professionally and competently and left a beautifully cleaned up work site.   I was VERY VERY pleased with the quality of their work.  I would absolutely use them again.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I hired James to remove a hot tub that we didn’t use.  When he responded to my inquiry he provided a fair estimate that beat out the competition and also sent a video showing the work he would do. You could tell from the video he really knew what he was doing. When he came by we added a few other things we wanted him to haul away, which he had no problem with and quoted us a fair price for as well. In his work he was prompt, professional and courteous. I am more than satisfied with the work that was done and will hire him again given the chance. I highly recommend using junk 180 for your hauling needs.<//Text>

I highly recommend James & Junk180. He is easy to coordinate with, his price is fair, he was right on time and he clearly takes pride in his work. I contacted him on a Saturday and he was here Sunday hauling things away. Solid choice if you are in need of junk removal services.</Review>

James contact me within 10 minutes of my request, had a quote for me on pictures that I submitted. Was able to arrange same day pick up. Took everything that I needed to be hauled away within 30 minutes and even cleaned up and swept up. Amazing job would definitely recommend him with any of Hauling needs in the future</review>

<Name>Paul Lee</Name>< Review>
I used to go to Guadalajara tire shop on Redondo beach next to the Tozai plaza.
They sell you defective used tires for $35.
I found about Vision Tires and have been going there for all my tire needs.  They fix flats in no time. Charge like $15?  I think its similar to other places.  They are up front and fast.
Recommend it for flat tires especially.</Review>

Good customer service, fair prices and fast job. Michelle, manager of this shop, provide AAA service and real discount. P.s. ask Michelle, and tell her that you are looking for  David's discount. I promise you'll get at least 10% off.< /Text>

The workers are nice decent people who seem to care and have good prices. However, their equipment for mounting and dismounting tires is no good for aluminum and painted wheels. I had a total of 6 tires dismounted and all my aluminum wheels have 4 of these marks on the inside surface.

Furthermore, when the technician used the pry bar to get the tire off or on he also scuffed up the visible surface of my wheels. The woman in the office who seems to be the manager was off to lunch when this happened so all they could offer my was an apology.

Finally, when the wheels were placed back on the technician used an pneumatic impact wrench to torque the lug nuts down. That is a big no-no as they should be properly torqued down using a torque wrench. I had to ask him to properly retorque the wheels. The tech came out with a colored torque socket. These are known to be less reliable than a calibrated torque wrench. Moreover, those sockets can lead to overtightening and damaged wheel studs. As soon as I got home I retorqued my lugs properly with a torque wrench.

I have been to many tire shops and this is the first time my wheels have been damaged by one. To the owner - please invest in proper equipment so that you do not damage people's wheels and please take the time to properly torque down lug nuts by hand.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMicz9OrG7SjEDKQCkMiSBMOi05mYdPPvdn8WJz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzdFcgJ_L2Xt2LM-CMhJAt9ZJ6U7yFtiEGGwRy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfybNyUjX9ljOhsNj1XR4YquqSAIt6cSKchQdj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcN_GP3tu-rhaCbJQ5Purein5s9buCtsxoBxsm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd2vtHV4iej9uy-aHTshCqKfmKOgmFN62gsbdo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlZOb8kgzWQyXM_tNuUzd_cJEStTGQn0Mp4QHt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Rating>

<text>From the friendly service to the old school 1950s service station vibe. If you are a local of gardena this is where you go for tires or alignments. Very well priced for both service and tires. I was in at 9, out by 915 from flat to fixed. This place is great, and provides a great service for the local community.< /text>< rate>

Great shop!! Instead of buying used tires just get new ones guys. They have really good prices on kumho tires. If you ask the guy running the shop he’ll break down which is the best price and which set of tires will last the longest.  I bought Bridgestone re71 a full set for a great price.<//Text>

They do a decent job here. Nothing spectacular. If you need tires and don't mind the wait this place is reliable. There's a liquor across the street you can grab a snack while you wait.</Review>

worse experience ever.  this place took two hours for them to tell me they can not put in the tires. both of the mechanics are very bad at what they do. I cannot state this enough this place is horrible and I will never come back here again if you want to save your self a headache do not come to this place at all!!</Text>

Came in thinking I needed new spark plugs and they diagnosed my car with a bad coil, save me money and repaired it quickly. They really do care about fixing your car and not just about money. 10/10 recommend and I will be going now everyone I need to</Review>

Very honest the person. I came here just by driving by cause I needed a smog check and I really liked it. He said why pay for something you dont need let me check what's wrong with it then I'll tell you what you need and it was just a change of oil. Fair prices highly recommend this place< /text>

<Text>Hands down, the best repair shop in all of the IE. Honak and his team were so professional. I was quoted a fair price and when I returned to pick up my car, everything was fixed on time and there were no surprises. They went WAY beyond what was expected. Basic Auto Repair is the place you'll want to take your car to.  THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.< /Text>< Pics>

<response>None</response><rating>5</rating><Text>Hanok is one of the most trustworthy mechanics I've ever met I've taken my cars there for years he is always been honest and straight up with what needs to be done. An example of this is I was having an issue with one of my cars, a starting issue the battery tested a little low so we replaced it everything was fine a few days later happened again. I took it back and Hanok found out it was the starter. He told me that he still had my old battery and that he can put it back in and it should give me another few months of life. Hanock refunded my money for the new battery instead of doing what  most mechanics would have done and just simply said "oh your starter is going out also"and not have returned my old battery. This in itself is a prime example of how honest Hanok is when I know for a fact others would have took advantage of the situation.   I highly recommend him and have to all my family and friends!<//Text>< user>

I've been going to Basic Auto for year's.  They are trustworthy, customer oriented, friendly and courteous. Because of this they are also very busy and hard to make contact. That's the down side.</text>

First time customer i was recommended by a friend. Brought my car in for a starter after AAA told me my battery was fine, but my starter was shot... WRONG! Henok called almost immediately to let me know my starter was fine, it was my battery. Fast, honest and fair. Definitely my new mechanic.< /Text>

Great customer service and great prices! I take all our cars when we have a problem to Basic Auto Repair. There hasn't been anything he couldn't fix for me yet. From a new engine to oil changes... I would recommend highly!</review>

Been coming here for years.  Found them by accident. Prices are fair, but the best thing is you can trust the owner, Henok.  When was the last time you felt you could trust a mechanic? In addition, it's a great crew.<//review>

I found this place by checking yelp reviews and read all the positive feedback. I'm glad I came here because they perform very professional work and take good care of your vehicle. Their prices are very reasonable and at times much less than other shops.
They are honest with you and won't hesitate to tell you if work is not necessary or if there's a better alternative to a repair. They will even refer you to other shops for services which they don't provide. I highly recommend them to anyone who is weary about mechanic shops... They will earn your trust.</Text>

Great affordable prices, diagnostic is free. Henok, Ismael, Carlos are honest Christian men, they know what they're doing! I've been taking my 2002 Nissan Altima there for past 3yrs. Theyll show me what needs to be fixed as a priority. I highly recommend this auto shop. 😁😇< /text>

First time here, Henok was extremely helpful and 100% honest with me. Finally I have my own mechanic that I can actually trust! I will be a return customer for sure. Thanks Henok!!!</text>

< review>
When I was kid I'ma say around ten years old, every time when I was in the car with my mom and she had to get a car wash she always came here no other place,all the time. So as soon as I got my own car I went to the one she did. When I got my car was for the 1st time I told her I went to the one she used to go when I was a child and she told me not to go there, but she didn't say why.

I finally got my first car when I was 20 years old I started coming here the same place my mom went to, so far I never realized why she ever switched this place was cool, they had decent food and the car always looks nice. I've been coming to this car wash for about two years since and I finally giving up. I think I understand why my mom left this place.

First of all the soap they use the windshield very smeared when water gets on it, which is very dangerous if it rains because it's so blurred and smeared due to the soap I have to put my windshield wipers on high. The air freshener they use is so strong I'm coughing all day. It gets to the point where every time I go to get my car washed I have to tell them to not put air freshener in there and most of them don't even speak English or I have to tell almost all of the employees.

But a couple days ago I had finally reached my breaking Point. Last week it had rained and my windshield was so blurry when driving to work and got into an accident. Note to before this,two weeks prior I had gotten my car washed  there and it was the last time.  They would sometimes have a tendency to keep my headlights on one cleaning the car and sometimes I would have to it my and them to please turn them off, something I should not have to say.

They didn't turn off headlights this time  And I had chose to go to the library as I needed to finish up a final and I needed to print out some work, as soon as I came back from the library from across the street, I got in my car and the battery was dead and they did absolutely nothing refusing to pay for the new battery I have to call for.

Look,they do a good job cleaning but they're very unprofessional. I've been coming here for the past two years because they did a decent job and it was cheap but after getting the same problems over and over again with no solution and constantly have to tell them what not to do each time I came I've given up and went to a better place.<//review>

<text>Got charged $20, for a sloppy job inside & out! Would never come here again! It was 6pm & they were Closed so I couldn't complain to the MNGR since my car was the last one to get done. Steaks all over the windows & all over my car. It just looked terrible! The inside was sloppy with the "interior dressing" which according to the guy cleaning it is just the same greasy Armor-All they use for the tires. Many wet patches and dry patches all over my interior, it looked just terrible. When I told the guy about the patches he just grabbed the towel and wiped it down but didn't bother to do the rest of the spots.

If you don't care about the details of your vehicle, then this is your place. But if you actually care about the quality of your wash and how your vehicle looks afterwards.  Then I strongly suggest not to come here.</text>< Gmap_id>

One week ago I went there to wash my car. Well I asked for the #1package offered at 11.99, it turns out to be 15.00 dollars just like that, why? Because I had an s.u.b but nothing posted to alert the public on their pricing.< /Text>

< Review>
Great place to blow some steam and wash the car but the real site seeing is the barber shop in the back great cuts great expertise in that field in that shop... A bunch of talent  there just wish there was more to see yes a little ghetto but worth the wait. Great burgers next door good system hook ups in the back..... Great pulga in the back I get all my stuff for my car fixed there great family owned business... Everyone is friendly unless you meet the hood then i dont know youre on your own... Lol ....<//Review>

<date>1453238388862<//date><review>This car wash is kind of expensive considering the area. The basic $10 wash doesn't include tire dressing nor apparently any kind of wheel cleaning. I noticed the hub caps were still very dirty shortly after leaving the car wash. No early bird or off peak car wash specials. Looks like I'll stick with Lennox car wash.</review><Rating>1<//Rating>< user>

If I could give zero stars I would. It took them 25 minutes to start vacuuming my truck, mind you there was no other car/truck waiting to be washed. Their prices are too high for the half ass job they do.<//Text>

<Review>Seriously!!! Be aware!!! Stay away from this gas station!!! I publicly make this store, it’s manager and staff responsible for cloning my debit card!!! It is the only place where I use my debit card at. I used it on Sunday 4/11/21 in the morning and today Monday 4/12/21 I have $100 in unauthorized purchases!!! And a second attempt to extract another $100. I have read other reviews of other customers having the same unpleasant and disgusting issue!!! Guess what?? You just lost a customer!!! If You don’t take care of your customers security your business will suffer!!!< /Review>< pics>

adopted and fell in love with our new member in January. Went in with an understanding my 5 month old kitten was a boy. Signed the papers, brought her home, yes her, read through her papers. Adoption papers say male, spay/neuter papers say female. One glance to her behind and it was obvious she was female. Very confused on how they could have mixed that up. Nonetheless we got the best little baby out of it, she fits in so well. Just thought the mix up was a little funny

Added note: first visit with her, the tech showing her to us mentioned she would usually just “snatch em up to hold them”
over the months we’ve noticed she absolutely resents that, it’s been a process in getting her to let us hold her or pick her up for too long
she loves sleeping on my head though</text>

July of last year I adopted a 5 month old golden puppy named sunshine when I found him on a site for puppy's needing adoption. So we go to the shelter and meat this pup and he was so excited he peed himself lol. We sign the paperwork and leash him up and brought him home. Now hes a year and a month old and doing great! Hes so smart loveable. I am so happy we brought our first dog home hes amazing and so handsome!<//text>

A month ago I visited the center looking to provide a home for two puppies. The staff was very helpful and courteous. I was matched with three loving pupps to adopt.  The best decision i could've ever made.  Thanks Ladies,<//text>

<Text>This is not a pet store. They are a shelter run off of donations and what little bit they get from the county. Do not expect a pet store when you go here to find your new family member!
We got our guy, named by the shelter Hunk of Love, renamed by us as Kona a month ago. He came home with tapeworms and hookworms, as well as a bad case of kennel cough. He had been seen by their vet and we weren't told he had any of those things, but only so much can be accomplished by a skeleton crew of people and no money to hire more help.
Don't adopt a dog unless you can care for it, and don't expect to not have to pay some money to get your pup up to perfect health. But don't let that deter you--if you care about animals and are truly invested in your love of them you will make the choice to support this shelter and adopt.
TL;DR: Despite the vet costs after adoption, my family and I couldn't be happier with our new addition!<//Text>< Pics>

i personally have not been here. all the reviews say its good! if i ever encounter a dog or puppy that does not have a home, i will for sure bring it here and i really hope they would care for it as much as i would. the reason i really cant adopt or save another dog is because i already have 6 beautiful dogs. I for sure hope i can adopt one from here.<//review>

If by any chance they get there hands on your dog and it's taken back to there shelter. Get ready to pay. 150.00 or more and if by the grace of god you have the money get ready to spend even more on vet bills Becuse your dog. Will have kernel cough.     Oh and if your dog is a pit bull they will have it fix.or yiu will not get it back and they will put it down. Without a second thought.< /Review>

To those who are outraged at the way the animals are treated here, I suggest they take another look. The staff goes through great strides to ensure the animals receive the love they deserve and I am confident in their knowledge to keep them healthy. I have been so impressed with them that I have become a foster for cats and their attention to foster homes is very comforting as well. I highly recommend this shelter for getting your next furry family member. By adopting here you can impact even more dog and cat lives.<//review>< Pictures>

I adopted a dog, and a 17 year old elderly cat. The owners surrendered him after 17 years for no reason. He was there a month until I took him. From what I have seen over the past week of being there everyday, the staff treats these animals very well. They are treated with kindness and love. As far as I've seen, this is a very good facility, and has a very compassionate staff. One of the girls that works there even started to cry when I adopted the elderly cat, because she was so happy he was getting a home for whatever time he has left. I have no complaints about this place</Text>

Our dogs had been let out of our back yard and we went to the shelter to see if they had been picked up. They said they had some matching the pictures I showed but that one was male and so it couldnt be our dogs. Wouldn't let me go see them. I get a call a few hours later saying  they had gotten the gender wrong and if I now wanted to come and look at them to verify if they were mine or not. I dont know if it was incorrect paperwork, or not knowing how to tell a male from a female... but not allowing me to see the dogs to see if they were mine regardless of the gender they thought they were was rude< /review>

<Text>This shelter has come a long way. They are on their way to becoming a no-kill facility. The staff here really care about the animals. They work closely with many rescues around the valley and have their own non-profit organization on the premises to insure that every animal is given a chance to be adopted.< /Text></record>

The lady at the shelter would not accept the kittens. She only offered to spayed or neuter the kittens at my exspence and then advised me to just turn them loose in an orchard!

They came onto my property and baited my dogs to their truck. Then called me as soon as they got to the pound. I came right away and picked them up. They charged $300 dollars and wrote my receipt for $200 to get my two dogs out. Not only that but they offered to charge me less if I paid in cash “so it wasn’t on the books”. Then to top all this off my dogs came home with kennel cough because this place is so poorly kept and disgusting. Idk what they did to my dogs but their demeanor around people has changed since and it’s sad. They target nice looking dogs because they know their owners will pay their outrages fees to get them out and it’s sickening.</text>

<Text>i lived in this community for over a decade , and with in the years of living here i can't say how rude the staff has been the past 5-7 years now. the director needs to find a new job she enjoys , i believe she is really rubbing the staff the wrong way and making the employees there all disliked as well in the community because of how rude and disrespectful this place and the staff is on a daily basis ! many times i have had volunteers tell me they can work there because of these issues and how the director runs the place so sad they can get away with everything they have ! NEW STAFF AND NEW DIRECTOR needs to be implanted and set in place i think to make a new start. do your research folks on them before taking your animal in here. Or be prepared for rude and disrespectful staff members.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

My parents female German shepherd was found as a stray on 6/13/16 and brought to this shelter at 1 pm. My dad went looking for her on 6/13/16 around 3:30 at this shelter and couldn't find her. I went two days later and was told that she was euthanized between 1 pm and 3:00 on the day that my dad looked for her. I was told by regular employee and the director that she euthanized because she was in poor condition(wouldn't eat and wouldn't move).  I explained to her that the dog was terrified and dehydrated since she ran off on Sunday morning. Anyways, I explained to the director that she is not a veterinarian to authorize euthanasia simply because my parents' dog was in "poor condition." I told her that she broke  California law since shelters must keep dogs for at least 3 days before a decision on them is made.  I told her that action will have legal consequences.</text>

Friendly and wonderful. We've had a great experience at Sutton swim for the last year. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. My son is swimming really well and loves going to classes! Clean facility and easy.</Text>

Many teachers we have switched due to level or schedule changes and it has been a great experience. The pool is indoor so its available throughout the year and the water is warm. The facility is neat and clean. I only wish they had competitive swims but other than that, I highly recommend this place.< /Text><rating>5</rating>< date>

<review>No stars. This business is a standing proof that people should support community based learning centers. Their policies are fine tuned to take as much money as possible from customers. I re-enrolled my kids just to know that i had to pay 2 months fee from last year for which i have no communication about. They were still considerate to way off one month.

Interesting fact is they did not tell me about this while I re-enrolled my kids and signed up for trail class. Now, i also lost $40 for the trail class which is non-refundable.< /review>< Pics>

My daughter has been attending Sutton Swim since she was 8 months old. She is now almost 3. We have had such a great experience with Sutton. The facility is nicely maintained and clean. The pool teaching equipment is fun and effective. The water temp is warm and comfortable. The staff are helpful and friendly. My daughter looks forward to swim class every week. I have recommended this school to all my mom friends. It’s great!< /Text>

<name>Payam Moradshahi</name><Date>1564421159344<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Great swim school with great teachers. Prior to Sutton, my daughter was going to Flying Fish in Mountain View but due to scheduling conflicts, we had to look for a new swim class and I'm glad I found Sutton.

The facility is very clean and well maintained. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Their scheduling is more flexible than other places. What I like about it is that it's an on-going enrollment. So once you enroll in a class for a certain time and day, you're good to go. At Flying Fish, you had to re-enroll every term and there were no guarantees that you will be able to enroll in something that matches your preference (which is why we decided not to continue with them).

They offer private, semi-private and group. Their price for semi-private was very reasonable for us so we went that route. Her teacher (Ms. Krista) is AMAZING! She knows how to deal with little kids and make sure they enjoy their time with her. When Ms. Krista is not available, we have had a very good experience with the substitute teachers. So overall, I think all the teachers are good.

They are very organized. I like their check-in process. Their evaluation, testing and overall pool policy is very organized and I like that.

The pool is clean and very warm. They have plenty of showers. The parents viewing window is also nice.

They have a kids area in the parents viewing where kids can watch cartoon and have their after-swim snacks.

I'm also very happy with my daughter's progress.

I highly recommend the swim school.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>We did not have a good experience with this place at all. After enrolling, things went well for the first month. In the fifth session, we had a substitute. Front desk told us our instructor is out. Same thing in the sixth session with a different substitute. At the end of the sixth session, i asked how long was our regular instructor out and whether she would be back in the next session. They said they didn't know. How do you not know how long your employee is gone and when they are likely to come back? It was surprising that they would tell their customers such a thing. Session 7, 8 and 9 were all different substitute teachers. So basically in a group lesson format with a new instructor each time who has no clue how much your kid knows and how to help him further, this was a waste of time and money. I even talked to the manager and she had the same response after 4 weeks of substitute. We don't know when we can get you a regular instructor. So we stopped going. If they have have enough regular instructor, you can always say no to customers and ask them to wait instead of taking their money and frustrating them like this.< /Text>< time>

We stopped more than 1 year ago going to Sutton since my 2 boys seemed to have lots of fun there but not make any more progress. We started there when they were babies, and it was great. They were  comfortable in the water really quickly en enjoyed it. When they are more advanced, it really depends on the teacher, but I felt we had to change so they could progress more quickly.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>So glad I happened by this Sutton Swim location before it opened. My girls and I have loved taking swim lessons here. My two oldest girls started in the baby swim class and at 1 1/2 and 6 months old. They are both intermediate swimmers now.
The teachers have been amazing at teaching the girls how to be safe in and near water as well as how to swim. They take their time with each child until they become comfortable with the water.
The lessons are on the pricey side but totally worth it. I recommend Sutton Swim to all my friends and I feel confident recommending it to anyone no matter what age.</Text>< pictures>

I want to give Sutton Swim School a shout out for their amazing teaching style.  I have been taking my kids to other swim places, yet my kids didn't excel and were not too sure of the water from the other schools.   After attending Sutton Swim School a couple lessons they became little fish and not afraid of the water.  There is sometimes two instructors per class, the water is warm, and the place is very professional.
Hope this helps.
Sincerely, Karen Wheeler</review>

My two daughters took swim lessons at Sutton Swim School at the location in Campbell and before in Cupertino. Sutton Swim School maintains a great group of swim instructors that patiently taught my girls how to swim. The pool is indoors, allowing lessons throughout the year. I highly recommend the school.</review>

This is a great swim school. The teachers are professional, warm, knowledgeable and hands-on, and focused on teaching correct technique. My kids have enjoyed their lessons and grown into fine swimmers here.<//text>

We've been coming here for 4 months.  The school is good, staff is friendly.  Facility is well maintained.  My two kids are not making much progress but I'm not sure if it's expected since we have not taken swimming classes before.  Though 30mins is too short a class, that is roughly about 25mins of instruction time in a group of 4 kids, so each kids gets 6 or 7 mins of swimming each week, that's it!<//text>

As an adult taking swimming classes cannot be as easy as one might think, but at Sutton Swim School, it’s been my best experience so far. Very professional and equally friendly staff. I love Alexandra she’s the best swim coach one can have .

Indoor heated pool open year round, great instructors, brand new clean facility opened in 2016, great management!! I personally love Miss Melody for entry level and from there on Miss Ploy at Intermediate & Stroke levels. Most of the instructors at Sutton at good and some excellent!</Review>

<Review>The paid evaluation process is very confused. They involved more than 3 teachers to do evaluation within 30min. Not quite understand why it can not be evaluated by one qualified teacher. Basically, the process indicates low confidence level, regarding evaluation.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>This school is nice and my nephews enjoyed classes there...until the owner, Earl Sutton, verbally attacked their mother in front of them when she was helping them quickly change after swim. When she apologized for apparently violating a policy that young boys cannot change with their parent in the women's room, he continued with the comment, "We don't want people like you here anyway!" I am sure he didn't mean "affluent with well-mannered children." More likely he was referring to the fact that she is an immigrant. An English-speaking, U.S. citizen who does not deserve to pay good money for a swim school to have an out-of-line owner make a racist comment in front of her children. My nephews were in tears after the altercation. Absolutely not a business I would offer patronage to.<//review>< Pictures>

They are positive, helpful, and want kids experience with swimming to be a positive one. It is an indoor pool with can cause issues with kids, heat, and pool chemicals.<//review>

Hi! I tried pizza from this place and I was really like it. They always make everything fresh. You don’t have to wait much, they are super fast. They deliver too. They also have fresh pastas and meat plates and wraps.You have to try.<//text>

<Review>A few simple tables and chairs are not meant to impress anyone. This is a low key joint, nothing special at the first glance. But do yourself a favor and try their "bread boat with cheese" - it is absolutely delicious! I am not sure what is the official name of it but it's a traditional dish prepared in Georgia (the country). Essentially it's a bread-bowl with cheese and an egg in it. Of course, you have to have the right kind of bread and cheese for the magic to happen and these guy got it right!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Absolutely love this place I come here almost everyday. Food is great and always on time. Now that they have new AC unit installed it's even better. My all time favorite is Ajarsky with 3 eggs and basturma. Almost forgot about the cook, nicest guy in town it seems like anything he makes is just straight up delicious. Hope this helps to decide. Good luck!!!< /Review><time>1501793614580< /time>< resp>

I highly recommend this. Resurant..First the price was more than reasonable 21.00 out the door.  Considering the whole meal was fresh ( even salad) the portions were large and very hot and Delious ....we had the Manicotti & Lasagna.. Even the cheese was nice and gooie fresh was not stiff at all.<//review>

<review>Staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and professional and service is fairly quick if you are doing a pickup rather than shopping in store. And this is what I like most about Ammo Brothers. Unlike Turners and any other local shop, Ammo Bros is the only store that updates their website daily with accurate accounts of what's in stock. It is also the only store that allows you to purchase firearms and ammo online. Once you place your order, your item is sent to your local store from any of its' network of locations. They then text you when the item arrives and is available for pickup. Then there is a separate line for pickup that is always much quicker than the other line. Turners almost always says there is one in stock, but you have to drive to the store, wait in a single line, only to find out that nothing is in stock, or someone just bought the last one. Ammo Bros takes that extra step to make an inherently stressful process a little less stressful.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>This location is awesome. The board outside has always been on point when it comes to in/out of stock. The employees are knowledgeable and always seem to be joking with each other which creates a good vibe. It makes the drive worth it since I pass the riverside location that should be renamed communist ammo but in all seriousness the riverside location is awful. I can’t imagine they are run or owned by the same people.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><user_id>114758336777461130253< /user_id><gmapID>0x80dc9e3328c08d31:0x45439df43e605d22< /gmapID><name>brenton ross<//name><Time>1621535276027<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I bought two guns here, one in-store, the other online.  Staff varies from friendly to standoffish.  That seems about standard for gun stores and will not hold it against them.  The place is well-staffed, and it doesn't take too long to get attended.  Prices are reasonable, at or below MSRP on most guns.  The same is not true in all shops.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

great store. great staff. Saved over $100 off the exact same item at Turner's.

I will say, however, despite being called "ammo" bros, they had next to no ammo in stock.</review>

Associates will not attend you and act as if they have much better things to do. Terrible customer service definitely do not waste your time here. Customers are only treated fair according to their skin tone and race if, you happen to be non white good luck even being attended or being treated as a human.< /review>

<text>The customer service here is pretty good, the guys who helped me out were very nice and professional. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars was because they let people in one at a time despite having plenty of staff and the store being very large with plenty of circulation. Don't really understand the logic of that, but highly recommended nonetheless.<//text><Rating>4< /Rating><time>1613716984900< /time>< Gmap_id>

The place is just OK. They are having to follow all the useless rules like the rest of us in California. They try to hurry you out so they can help someone else which I understand. Due to the demand and election their ammo prices are pretty high. It’s annoying when you are on the wrong side of supply and demand. I give Big 5 sporting goods credit for keeping their prices the same during these times and will continue to give them my business.</Text>

Customer service is horrible, I got here at 5pm an hour before closing and didn't get in. I Came in to pickup my gun, everything was done and takes 15 min tops to hand it over and finish remaining paperwork. They take 1 person at a time, 4 different people came out and they let 1 in during 50 minutes of waiting. Then told I couldn't go in but the guy behind me that arrived 10 min before closing could and get a bs reason of why I couldnt. Avoid this shop others are way better</Text>

Normally like ammo bros. Came in today straight from work as it’s my only day off for a while to pick up my gun. Sign outside says no paperwork after 5:45 but got there 20 till and waited to let in for 15 min till a customer finally comes out and tells me I should just go inside the salesman aren’t doing anything just talking. Came in said I wanted to pick up my gun and told me it was too late. Really disappointed in the laziness of Saturday’s staff if your works too hard for you find a different job< /Text>

Waited in line for an hour starting at 5pm their new temporary hours are 6pm closing.  They helped 4 people in that time.  Two people left 15 min before closing and there were 5 people in line. They opened the door at 6:05 to tell us they are closed and won’t help anyone else.  Never ordering from them or giving them business.</Text>

<text>They had over a dozen people waiting outside for over an hour. Worker walks out and tells them they are closing for the day. Prior feedback states that it's not the first time it's happened. Hopefully they'll take this feedback serious and stop wasting people's time. Please consider giving people a courtesy heads up ahead of time for future references.< /text>< Pics>

Great experience shopping here. Everyone working at the store is helpful and friendly.  I prefer Ammo Bros. over the other sporting goods store that starts with a "T".  My background check will return with an "undetermined"
status, which still allows the store to release the firearm. Big "T" won't release it but Ammo Bros. will.  And they will match or beat prices.<//Text>

My husband and I went yesterday and we drove about 35 minutes to here we got here at 5:30 they close at 6 we wait in line for 35minutes cause they were 3 people in front of us. And no body said that after 6 they won’t take any more customer’s, that they were already inline before 6.So we were next when at 6:05 someone comes out and said we are not talking anymore customers, came back tomorrow.Its very unprofessional to be wasting customers time. Why do you guys think are still in business , because of customers ,so please keep in mind their time.</Review>

We waited for over 45 minutes tonight in the cold to get up to the door to be turned away 30 minutes before they closed. They stated they were only taking the next four people in line. I was #5!!!! The lady who came to the door was rude, she explained they had families too. I understand in this crisis that it’s been crazy but for over 45 minutes we waited in line and not a single employee stated they were taking their last customer at 630 nor did they mention they were only taking the next amount of people in. Understanding that the three other employees that came to let people in never mentioned. There was a line outside of 30 people deep.....do you think they would all have waited if they ever mentioned their cut off time. We will not be returning and don’t recommend you to either!!!</text>

<text>I buy guns and ammo there all the time never had any trouble with no one there. Everyone is friendly. Wait times vary now a days but if you are going to get there go early they have families to attend to as well just saying. Or drive by like I do to see if there is line. Thank you guys at ammo bro’s.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dc9e3328c08d31:0x45439df43e605d22< /Gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating><time>1591411888617</time>< name>

Even with all the craziness going around and 20 people long line waiting outside the staff stayed friendly and help how ever they could. Everything was as quick as possible and were helping as much as they could to get everyone through.< /Review>

To long of line. Owners or managers do not have any customer knowledge. The only reason they r still in business in this area, there is no other competition. There is no reason why there's a line at 4pm. These knuckleheads dont know how to get their customers in and out.</Text>

They have forever lost my business. I bought my wife a Lady's Smith 357 at the Costa Mesa gun show and of course it's busy and we were passed off several times to various people until we finally got all the paperwork done. I'd say I took about an hour from start to finish. Now the wait is on. The reason for the purchase was we were planning a range day trip of about eight friends up to some property in Campo and we were really excited to try out this new pistol. We had plenty of time to get the gun since we cod pick it up after the ten day hold. We get it Tuesday and we can get a new holster and a few other things so she can be comfortable with her new gun. Ten days comes and goes so we jump in the car and drive up to the Mira Mar store but when we get there they can't find the gun. Actually they can't even find the paperwork let alone the almost $800 gun. So about 40 minutes later we get the "I'll call you tomorrow" line. Well tomorrow comes and goes and still nothing. I waited another day and still got nothing. I call back and nobody knows what going on with the missing gun and paperwork. Well of course I'm not real happy with the lack of customer service and so I start calling the other branches to try and get ahold of a manage or regional manager that can get me some answers. No one can help so I call the San Diego branch again and got some really nice guy that seemed to care and he promised me that someone would call me right away. That was the best service I received from this company. About five minutes later I got some guy with an attitude and very unapologetic call me and say he was the general manager. He said they were shorthanded and they didn't know were the gun was because it never got unloaded from the Costa Mesa gun show. He said all the paperwork was fine and the background check was good but the gun was sent to the Las Vegas Shot show. How does this happen? Yeah, just "short handed", not sorry? Not what I wanted to hear. I get a call back from the one guy that was helpful and asked if I wanted to cancel the transaction but I'd eat the almost $40 that goes to the state so I said no. He told me he would have the gun Monday and I'd get a call when it came in. Of course we didn't get to take it to range day so there's that, and wouldn't you know it, no call on Monday. I finally called on Tuesday and had to explain everything again to the guy on the phone and he said "bummer". Well yeah this has been a major bummer. My wife picked up the gun on Thursday since she was in the area and they offered her a 10% discount on ammo when she was there. That's not how you fix this colossal screw up on your part. I was warned by several of my friends that have had their own bad experiences with ammo bros but I made the mistake of not listening. Listen to this, I will never use ammo bros again. One star for the guy that helped, thanks dude<//Review>

My family has purchased many firearms! We walked in before 11am and the store was completely empty! The lady associate or manager was ABSOLUTELY RUDE!!! Short with words talked as if I was uneducated and didn’t understand! I’m not the type to expect the red carpet rolled out but how about a little kindness! Ammo bros should be ashamed and embarrassed to have someone represent them and be the face of their store! Never will I ever recommend any family friend and associate there! Absolutely disappointed with our first time experience at that location!!!</review>

<review>This is a scam company, definitely don't visit this place don't buy they're shetty stuff. They've tried to rip me off 200$ pretending that I want to cancel a contract. I've brought all the legal papers that they asked and lost all day waiting to pick up a hunting gun. At the end of tha day I had nothing just a headache. I'll sue them and fill up a complain at the consumer protection< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I've been to this location a few times and I've always come into a clean and well stocked shop. Staff is always approachable, knowledgeable, and make an effort to at least ask if you need help or want to look anything behind the counter. I got lucky enough to come in on a Flash Sale for their Glocks and scored on some extra gear, I highly recommend Ammo Bros. Their competitive pricing and inventory will surely service your needs.<//Review>

Customer service is horrible, getting anyone to help you is next to impossible. I have been to this location 3 separate times now with the same outcome. This last trip I asked if they carried a holster for my gun, they said "probably Not " Then proceeded to stand next to me and watch me look through all their holsters like I was going to steal something, never offering to help. Dont waste your time stopping in here.<//text>

It comes with a sunny side up egg and some sliced green onions. The portion size was a good amount for one person. I like that their menu has a good variety to choose from. The place is clean, the staff is nice, it was warm inside the restaurant though. I did get lost looking for this place, it's in a business building next to a Nexem staffing agency.<//Text>

I really like this place; the menu exactly hits the spot for anyone looking for a great lunch spot with modest prices and has a variety of flavor palettes.

In one meal I had an Italian item and an Asian item; both were executed flavorfully (not bland) and thoughtfully (the flavors were exciting and authentic).

Not only that, but there are many different platforms for the flavors, whether by bowl, bun, wrap, or noodle.

Importantly, the portion sizes were satisfying!

Finally customer service and speed is good. I don't know if it's their preferred method, but if you're not able to call, they also take orders by email. Useful for detailed orders or during a work meeting!< /Text>

A real hole in the wall restaurant that I stumble onto after work. Another great surprise as everything I tried was fantastic. Sandwhiches, comfort food, and the Korean food are all tasty. Service is okay and it can feel a little cramped. But still great for a nice bite.</text>

We stopped here for our lunch break. The food was amazing. Of course there is no inside seating but they do have two tables to eat outside. I will be coming here again!!! Great food! Great service! Olive Grill has a variety of items on their menu to satisfy any craving. The place is clean</Text>

<Review>A very nice surprise this place has delicious food. I noticed lots of people who works close by loves eating here. Their beef plates and sandwiches are to die for. The smoothies were tasty and cool. Friendly and fast service all the time.< /Review>< pics>

They also have breakfast, smoothies, and healthy options. Came for lunch and ordered the Korean BBQ beef plate. Food was cooked to order and came out quick. Love the Asian fusion of the dishes. Amazing! I will be back.</text>< name>

There were a couple tables outside with people eating their lunch.  The inside had quite a few tables and almost all of them were occupied.  I intended to try the Korean BBQ Sandwich when I walked up to the counter, but after looking at the menu, I ordered the Fresco sandwich and an order of small fries well done, not limp.  It took about 10 minutes for my order number to be called.  The cashier asked me if I wanted any ketchup packages and I declined but asked if he had any ranch dressing.< /text>

I found this nice little hidden gem/ golden nugget of a place very close to my work location and their menu items are phenomenal!! They open at 7:30am every weekday and they have an awesome selection of food items to choose from: Omelettes, bagels, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, bowls, salads, soups, teriyaki chicken or beef plates, fried rice plates, smoothies and even includes healthy food options, and/or vegetarian options. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Ontario area or even just passing by!!</text>

<resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Hands down the best food in Ontario. I used to work in the area from 2014 to 2016 tried everything around here. The wait can be long during the busy lunch hour, but it is worth waiting for (or taking your lunch a little later to avoid the crowd). I came back to try it out today (August 2018) and everything was just as good as I remembered. Same friendly owner and same great food. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in town.<//review><username>Daniel Phan< /username><userid>107403042683486338310<//userid></record>

The food is great and made when ordered; the place is kind of small but the hospitality of the owner outweighs the size of the place... It does get busy during typical lunch hours so make sure to order ahead if you have limited time. I've tried their grilled chicken salad; teriyaki bowl and sandwiches & they're all equally great.< /Text>

The Yakisoba (if you're not familiar with the dish) is chow mein, diced cabbage, and grilled chicken. It is served by itself. Delicious with their branded hot-sauce.As for the spicy pork plate, it is served over white steamed rice, along with a slice of watermelon. The pork is very tender, spicy and minimal diced onion</review>

Tried Kimchi fried rice w/spam & egg. Yuuuumyyy. Just the right spiciness from Kimchi and very flavorful combo. Kept from sweating with a cool mandarin Jarritos. Plenty of food, but not too much-just right said Goldilocks. Ha ha ha.  Cozy environment with great service with a smile.</text>

This place has not let me down! The service is great and the food is awesome. I always get the chicken veggie bowl, or chicken yakisoba. I usually call my order in for pick up, this place can get very packed during lunch time so either get their early or wait till after 1pm to grab a table.< /text>

<text>The service is nice, the food is spicy depending on what you order. Accommodation with tables and chair were standard, not too large an area. Location is in a mall and is good for quick lunch, dinner etc. Will surely go back when I am shopping at that mall again. The food. Has a nice aromatic smell.<//text>< Response>

<Date>1535095047970< /Date><rating>5< /rating><review>I'm a pretty picky eater, there are a lot of things I don't like so I am used to picking things out and making piles. LOL So I was so excited to find this place where the dish I ordered had nothing but fresh yummy stuff, no piles! I had the Vegtable Bowel with no chicken. It had bean sprouts, cabbage, carrots , onions and zucchini on a bed of rice. Perfectly seasoned, still crunchy, very fresh and yummy. They have lots of options for vegetarians which was great because those places are sometimes hard to find. They serve their meals in REAL dishes! I would highly recommend checking this place out. It is small so be prepared to wait a bit, but it is so worth it!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Please understand that we try to get customers in and out in a timely fashion due to their short lunch breaks.  Due to many past experiences, a single person bringing in multiple cards of their coworkers tends to put a delay on the rest of the customers waiting in line.

Tutti Mangia is a very small, intimate restaurant with New York - type seating (e.g. tables right next to each other). The service we received from our server, Amy, was professional, helpful, and fun.</review>

I scheduled Junk King to come pick up a sleeper sofa and TV stand. They were great, arrived as scheduled and very quickly took care of the job. Very affordable.< /text>

Update 1/5/2020.
Updating my rating from 1 to 4 stars.  Luis called me this morning to apologize regarding the service and the miscommunication.  Junk King discounted my service fee for my inconvenience.  Luis gave me his personal number and told me if ever i needed service in the future to call him directly and he would take care of me.  Thanks Luis.

I just got finishing building a deck when a member of our family went to the hospital. Thus I didn’t have time to deal with clean up.  I called Junk King and told them I just finished building a deck and had wood left over and other general junk I wanted cleaned up.  They showed up gave me a quote after I showed them everything I wanted cleaned up.   Then they removed all the general garbage. After all that was loaded in their truck they told me they could not take pressure treated wood.  They should have told me that from the beginning. I would have called 1800-GOT-JUNK as they  would take it.   Basically they took all the stuff I could have called the city to pick up for free and charged me $340.00 and I still have all the left over wood.  Not only that when they sorted all the wood they moved the pressure treated wood right in front of a gate so I had to move it.   They left the place a mess.  I called Junk King to complain and the dispatcher agreed that they should have let me know prior to booking and the workers should have let me know before loading. He asked that they pick it up. They agreed to it. I thought we were done. Then a few minutes later they told me their boss called and told them they could not pick it up.  They tried to take off and still had not finished picking up the regular stuff.  I called dispatch back and the person said he would have the main guy I originally talked to call me back. I waited.... waited.... they never called me back.  Very unprofessional.  Moral of the story don’t use Junk King use 1800GOTJUNK.   I have used both services now. 1800GOTJUNK picked everything up and swept up and left the place clean. Junk King didn’t pick everything up and didn’t properly communicate to give me a choice of not using them and then not only did they not sweep but they moved stuff in my way.  I will update this review if Junk King contacts me to make this right.< /text>

The guys arrived after calling to let me know they were on the way. They were so nice and helpful and efficient! We used the same company years ago and had a good experience then, too. Not cheap but reasonable prices and they are upfront so no surprises. Definitely recommend them highly!< /review>

The team was running a little late but they kept me informed and when then showed up with 2 trucks so the job was done in half the time. Decent price and Joe, Alex and team were great. Will definitely use Junk King's again<//Review>

The team picked up a sofa we no longer needed. They were professional and courteous throughout the experience. They made sure to call beforehand to alert me they were en route. Would definitely recommend!<//Review>

<review>Even though we had only a small amount of stuff from cleaning out closets and yard junk, they were quickly responsive and it was easy to schedule a time.  The driver and assistant wore masks and followed safety protocols, were very professional.  Would not hesitate to use this company again.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

As a professional property management group, we have use Junk-King as our vendor of choice when tenants need a recommendation for a hauler upon move-outs. Junk King has been the most professional hauling company when it comes to pickups and updates for arrivals. Pricing is fair and reasonable. I recommend all property management needs.< /text>

I had a great first-time experience with this junk haul service in Santa Clara/ Sunnyvale area. I started with estimating in their website by adding the type of items that I wanna get rid of. I was able to list down all my items in the text box they provided wile booking. Then, got an estimate online. Was able to book a slot for appointment. One day before, they sent me a reminder text. Then, 15 minutes before arrival they called me and assured me that they are on the way. On arrival, they took a look at the items and they exactly charged what the website showed as an estimate. In total, my items were little over their quarter truck size, so they charged me for the difference, but that wasn't a largely different from the estimate. They provided me 20 bucks discount for booking online. They take their items only after you agree in person on day of haul. I was able to securely pay online after the haul when they sent an invoice over email. So, I highly recommend to use their website to book online and also mention all the items you want to get rid of while submitting the booking. Overall, these guys are the best. I would recommend for anyone and would try next time I want to get any junk hauled.<//Review>

<Review>Damion, Jesse and Andrew came out and were so helpful and efficient! They came out evaluated what I needed to have done, gave me a very fair estimate, and took what I needed away! It only took them like 30 minutes to load two truck loads. They were such nice young men too! I am so happy with the service and the price! I would 100% recommend using them!!</Review>< Pictures>

I appreciated the phone calls that were for minor rescheduling as well as the rescheduled for a few days later.  The latter was due to the holiday.  No problem for me since I do not have many other obligations.

It was unfortunate that the lead person on the rescheduled was different from the first one.  Since he was different, some of the things that I had pointed out were not removed.  Even a few of the other things I mentioned on the actual day were left.  I must admit I was a bit tired and did not mention them again.

Everyone was polite and masked.< /Text>

I had a time slot for 10-12. They called me around 10am to let me know what time they would be here. They got the job done quick and even took more items than I planned. Good price and easy to set up an appointment!</Text>

<Time>1599075217289<//Time><rate>5< /rate><text>Hot tub removal and disposal. Junk King was great!  My hot tub and gazebo hasn't been used in 9 years and I've wanted it out of my yard for at least 5 years. I just never knew what kind of service provider does that and I didn't know how anyone could get it out of my yard and thru the gate and fence.

They came over and gave me an estimate and it was absolutely worth the money to clean up my yard of this hot tub so I can use the the space better.

They were professional and took care to be COVID compliant. They got it done in about an hour. Smooth and easy.

Definitely recommend.</text></record>

<review>Positives.  Friendly.  Removed what was asked.  Did not make a mess.  Efficient.

Not so goods.  Did not call in advance to notify when they would arrive as I was informed.  Quoted much higher price than estimate from phone call.  Had to negotiate a better price, but still far from initial quote.  My estimated quantity was accurate, so it should have been close to the initial quote to be fair.< /review><user_name>Jimmy Lee< /user_name>< GmapID>

When I called we needed someone to come same day, and they initially said they were booked all day in our zip code. They were very responsive to call back and say they had a cancellation and came 3 hours ahead of schedule, and were able to pickup 2 and a half loads and finish the job within about 3 hours. The crew of 2 was professional and quick, polite and flexible. Thank you very much!!< /review>

<review>When they finally showed up, the work was first rate and priced fairly. They were almost 4 hours late (beyond their 2-hour window). There was sympathy from the receptionist but no compensation from the company. I re-scheduled. They arrived on time the second time and did a fantastic job. Took care not to damage anything and cleaned up well. Nice fellows. They work their tails off; I hope they are well paid.< /review><user_name>David Bruck<//user_name><GmapID>0x808fcb892427059b:0x8922b0be32424b9< /GmapID>< userid>

<Review>The process was very easy to set up and get an appointment. The employees that came to pick up called ahead to give me their ETA and were on time. They even waited for me as I was running late. They also let me add additional items that I didn't realize were left behind at my old home and even suggested they take some of the garbage out of my trash bin for me as it was overflowed. TOP CLASS service prompted me to leave this survey when I normally don't take the time to do so.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808fcb892427059b:0x8922b0be32424b9</gmap_id></record>

I have a tough address to get to, and they were among the precious few who immediately understood my directions and arrived without issue. I way overestimated the size of my haul, and they reduced the estimate accordingly (I thought it would take a whole truck - turned out it was only 1/8 of a truck!). Very fast pickup, friendly and professsional. They were cognizant of what I was throwing out, and alerted me to a few tools that they thought I might want to keep. They were right! Will absolutely call Junk King for all hauling needs!</text></record></dataset><record>

Junk King came to our rescue when we bought our first home and started our remodel! We had so much construction waste that it took over our entire deck. I was amazed at the efficiency of the two men who came to collect everything, they worked hard and fast and got my deck cleaned off in record time. They went out of their way to schedule us so we could have other work done in a timely manner. I will not hesitate to use them and refer them to others in the future! Thank you Junk King!!< /review>

I requested a quote after business hours expecting to get a response the following business day. I not only got a response an hour after my request I completed the quote and made an appointment within an hour time. When the gentleman showed up today to remove my items they were professional and only touched items that they were removing. Highly recommend.<//review>

3 gentlemen arrived on time with tools and an empty truck. They were hard working courteous and accommodating. They tackled every single ugly aspect of the job with great attitude. They transformed a filthy trash heap into a clean yard. I can now look out there and see the beauty that was beneath. I think their charges were fair and I highly recommend them.< /review>

Spring cleaning had us getting rid of lots of old yard furniture, including a large outdoor daybed and cast iron propane fire pit among other things, and two old couches from inside that needed to go. The pile kept growing larger and larger, but the Junk King’s showed up and hauled it all away quickly and professionally for what I deemed a fair price for the work involved. They did arrive outside of the scheduled window, but were communicative about it, so no harm done. Thank you! I know who to call when I work up the nerve to tackle the garage 😉.<//review>

I needed a hot water heater removed and properly disposed of. Junk King San Jose was prompt with their response to my initial message on Yelp. They immediately quoted a very competitive price that included a surprising $20 discount. A reschedule from my initial appointment was needed due to an understandable staffing issue however it was all communicated quickly and professionally. On the day of the removal from my rental property I was texted a picture of the water heater and then received a confirmation phone call. Top notch service and polite employees. All around a great experience. I highly recommend them.< /Review>

Employees arrived on time and were professional.
Issue is the prices. For a small couch with roll up bedding was $148.00! They were on my doorstep only reason I said yes. Smart move by Junk King. I was expecting $80 which is still super high but wanted a professional company during these times. All the other small garbage hauling businesses were charging me $50.<//review>

Super quick and friendly. They loaded everything on their own and packed it as efficiently as possible to keep my costs with check. Depending on your junk, the bill can be higher. Brick or concrete has an additional surcharge.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I needed to get rid of a queen sized mattress. I put it in a cover, took a picture, asked for a quote and got a response back from them quickly online with a written estimate. We also called Got Junk: they quoted us double on the phone and refused to give a written estimate. Anyway we went with Junk King. The guys who showed up were great. They had their masks on. Two of them tossed the mattress in and told me they’d bill me online. The third guy never shut the engine off. The whole thing took less than 3 minutes.</Text>< pics>

They responded quickly, gave us a great quote, and picked up everything quickly (and we had a lot of stuff) from old very heavy woodshop equipment, furniture, bags of junk and yard debris - all gone in around 30 minutes.

<text>Always a pleasure to work with the guys at Junk King. They arrive on time after giving a pre arrival call. They are quick and remove whatever you desire to be removed. Everything from household junk to furniture and even appliances. Their quote online was dead on and very reasonable. I use Junk King for work as well as personal junk removal needs. Highly recommend!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Kevin and Luis took really good care of my mother in law. She had some junk piling up. My mother in law has high standards in terms of customer service and she gave Luis rave reviews as extremely professional and courteous. While there was some initial confusion about the appointment schedule, Luis and Kevin took care of business and made everything right, right away. I will definitely use Junk King again; it’s a local business with high touch service and good people.< /review>

The junk king crew came when they said, were reasonably priced and took my junk away immediately. Exactly what I was looking for. They even took the time to sweep up and make sure the whole area was presentable when they left.< /review>

<text>I had a lot of junk I wanted to get out of my garage for a while now. So I made an appointment online for junk Kings to come give me an estimate. Made an appointment for 12:00 to 2:00 on Friday, they called that morning and asked if they can come early, and they were here by 11:00. I should them what I wanted to get rid of they gave me an estimate, I agreed and it took them 20mins to get everything loaded and taken away. It was easy, quick and they three guys that came were friendly, efficient and professional. I would use them again.<//text>< Pictures>

This is my third time using Junk King and I’m happy every time they come by. They make the process easy. They come when they say they will. The price is reasonable. They worked out touchless pick up during covid, it’s great. They are my go-to junk guys. Thank you guys!< /Text>

Very fair price to haul away a large amount of old household items including a small sofa, ottoman, ping pong table and old nordictrack. Two gentlemen worked very hard to load our stuff into an already full truck. Very professional and swept up all remnants once they were done. Will definitely use them again!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Excellent service. Very courteous. Punctual.
Explained their process before giving estimate.
Considering the variety of things I had to get rid of, the cost was very reasonable.  I would hire again.
Thank you,  Junk King!</review>

The team was polite and prompt. They handled the items quickly and left me with a big smile. I was satisfied with the price compared to taking my time, the cost of a rental vehicle, and fees. I'll use them again.< /review>

Exactly what you want.  They responded within an hour with a quote and stuck to it.  Scheduled a mutually acceptable time.  On the day of they gave 25 minutes advance notice they were on their way.  Showed up on time.  They were prepared.  Got in and out fast and offered several ways to pay them.< /Text>

I texted to see about getting an estimate and set up an appointment for the following day. I was told someone would call me about 20 minutes before arrival, and to my surprise, they actually called and confirmed that they were on their way. When the two gentlemen arrived, they gave a very fair and reasonably priced estimate, and I agreed. They were able to take the junk right then and could not have been nicer or more professional. Highly recommend, and if junk piles up again, we know who to call!<//Text>< time>

< Review>
They called 15 minutes before coming as promised, assessed the amount of junk we had and gave us a quote. Then they came the next day to haul everything away including a leather sofa, mattresses, other furniture and stuff we had in our back yard and side yard. They worked very efficiently and were accommodating enough to take mattress and box spring we had in boxes in the garage and switch them for ones on a bed, then haul away the old ones. I had contacted several other places that didn't even bother to call me back. I definitely will use Junk King again if I need that kind of service.<//Review>

Excellent all around: This company was the first to respond to my request for quote. Then it got better from here. They came very quickly to look at the job and provided the lowest quote among about 4 that I got. They also provide what seems a rare service of hauling dirt.

The quote system is professionally done in writing via email. I made the mistake of asking for a total price that's higher than the quote and it got corrected to the right amount. The truck and serviceman came right on scheduled time (calling ahead as well). The work was done exactly as desired.

I would recommend Junk King 110% and I can see why they get 5 stars overall!! Well done!< /Text>

We needed to clean out about 1/4 of stuff in the garage to get ready for moving, mostly paper and plastic recycling and a few items for donation. We were getting a little nervous because it was getting close to the end of the appointment window, but when they got here, they were friendly and professional and worked quickly and efficiently to clear the stuff out.  Very happy with the decision to call them.< /review>

I had Junk King do a large cleanup for me at work a few years ago. They were fantastic! When I finally got the motivation to do my own cleanup at home, I thought of the great service and respectful handling of the job done at my work, so of course I called them again. No surprise today, they came early, gave a fair estimate, and cleaned up after they were done! It made me feel reassured noticeing that the person in charge was also one of the crew from from the job a few years back and he remembered the job they did back then.  Truly a great experiance!</text>

Friendly and professional. The two gentlemen were fast and accurate. Good pricing. I was in the process of moving and didnt have the means or time to dispose of my furniture any other way. Junk King is a big help! I highly recommend Junk King.</Text>

<Date>1573318877356</Date><text>100% recommendation. Antonio and Billy arrived within the allotted time, called ahead of their arrival to let me know they were on their way. They were efficient, friendly, professional. They also had the unexpected complication of maneuvering the 5 appliances and water heater down the driveway, across the front porch to get around the construction van blocking the driveway. Both gentleman took it in stride and were done in no time.

< Review>
Junk hauling was much more expensive than I expected. $230 for not that much junk (they equated it to the volume of a pick-up truck). Maybe all haulers charge this much, but I was shocked. They also showed up an hour beyond my two hour window. They did call ahead of time, though, to say they would be late. The two gentlemen were polite and worked quickly.<//Review>

Have used Junk Kings in the past. Very convenient when you do not own a truck and need things cleared-out. Not happy this time because this was the smallest load I have ever had picked-up and it was the most I ever paid. May have to look for a new hauling company. Bummer!</Review>

Within minutes of me accepting their fair price to haul everything away, they had it all loaded and told me that I would receive an invoice by email that I could pay by credit card. Excellent! By the time I went into the house, there was the email and it took less than a minute to pay. It does not get better than this! I could not be happier with my experience. The three gentlemen that did the work were polite and friendly as well. This was Grade A service.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The Junk King guys were fantastic! They were courteous, friendly and informative! They came by and gave me a great quote and ended up not needing to use the whole truck so they charged me less! I would absolutely recommend these guys, after they were done they swept up and made sure everything they were doing was okay by me. Great work Junk Kings, you guys deserve your crown!</Text>

This is the second time I’ve used Junk King, and I’m extremely satisfied.
Kevin is easy to work with, and Darnel was quick, careful - and strong!!!
I’d call them first, next time I need to trash things, and highly recommend others to do the same.</text>

This was a great service.  The team called ahead of time to let me know they were coming.  They gathered items from three locations around our house, including extracting plywood and other items stored in our garage rafters.  They were friendly, cheerful and efficient, and I really appreciate the help!<//Text>

They came a little late but it felt good that everything was gone. Left everything clean. Had me check that everything I wanted to be taken was gone. Was polite and made sure they weren’t  taking anything they weren’t supposed to. I had a good experience!!</Review>

<review>The people who came were friendly, and diligent. They took everything, and cleaned up after. My only complaint is that their first driver didn't arrive for work, and no one informed me. So I waited for an 8-10 am time slot to no avail. Calling customer service didn't help, until my 3rd try, when they connected me to the owner. He helped direct a new truck to my place, and everything worked out in the end.

Apparently the customer service department is structured to set up appointments, but they have no ability to resolve issues like this.

Still, I found no one who was rude, and the problems were resolved. I have a cleaner place, and someone else is dealing with 15 cu yards of debris.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Great service. Texted with them to arrange an estimate. Showed up on time as promised. Exceptionally polite, friendly guys, gave a fair price to haul the stuff on the spot. We were done in a few minutes as if the junk was never there. I highly recommend, and will take my own recommendation next time I need to haul away junk. These guys are great.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fcb892427059b:0x8922b0be32424b9< /gmap_id></record>

This was a great service.  The team called ahead of time to let me know they were coming.  They gathered items from three locations around our house, including extracting plywood and other items stored in our garage rafters.  They were friendly, cheerful and efficient, and I really appreciate the help!<//Review>

<Review>The team was nice and courteous.  I thought the cost was pretty high though.  It was $350 for what took 5 minutes to load in the truck since I had bagged all the loose junk.  They charge by volume so it is what it is I guess.  I could have turned them away after getting the quote but I bit the bullet since I wanted the pile gone.  Moving forward i’ll only use it I have really heavy and scattered items.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Great company. Scheduled my pick up online and got a discount. The crew was fast and efficient cleared away everything I had. Would definitely call again.
Edit- 10/29/20 I actually did use them again. Second time was just as good. Fast efficient. Contactless payment- worth every penny. Thank you< /Text>

Will definitely call back with more business. Very nice person on the phone scheduled my free estimate. Driver called 15 minutes prior. When they arrived we showed them what needed to be taken and got our estimate. I feel it was fair and they loaded everything right then and there.  Very polite and patient with my mother who uses a walker.<//Text>

Very professional crew! The guys were on time and moved our 50” rear projector TV quickly, and for the same extremely reasonable price, that they had quoted me over the phone! Another well known business quoted me an astronomical price of $200+ to haul away the same item. Great job!!!<//Text>

The men arrived during the window time given & quickly removed the very large Cal king foam mattress.
The office staff setting up the appt. was very courteous & gave me an excellent price!
I had already compared prices with several other companies so I knew I had an excellent price quoted to me.
Next time I will definately use them if I need junk removed.

<Text>Junk King deserves 5 stars. First of all, JK got the job because of prompt replies and excellent communication with the people out in the field. We were given a same day window for the junk pickup. We were given a 15 minute heads up before arrival. The haulers were polite and we were surprised and pleased how efficiently they worked to get our junk on the truck. I paid them, they covered the junk to prevent anything from flying out, they drove off, and our junk was gone. Just like that!<//Text>< name>

<username>John Baty</username><Review>This was our second time working with Junk King. We had an appointment window scheduled from 10a to noon. Unfortunately all the trucks/guys were on big jobs and could not make it to our house until around 2:30p. Luckily I had the day off from work, so the delay didn't matter too much to me. When the guys (Luis and Joseph) did arrive they were both very professional, personable, and apologized for being late. Luis gave me a quote after seeing all the things we wanted to get rid of and once I agreed he and Joseph made quick work of loading our junk into their truck. We will definitely call on Junk King the next time we need to get rid of stuff.<//Review>< userid>

Great service and value.  I'd requested service via the Junk King web site and it was scheduled in my first available time slot.  The Junk King employees who showed up were very friendly and efficient.  We had about 2/3 of a truck worth of various items - old outdoor kids play furniture, an old outdoor heat lamp, packing boxes from our garage, old rugs, leftover sand from a sand box, etc.   They loaded everything up in 45 minutes.  Highly recommended!<//Review>

<text>Awesome service. I called to get a price quote for a couch we wanted to get rid of. The quote I was given was $110 which was MUCH lower than anyone else had offered. I let the woman I spoke to know that I needed to run things by my wife before I could say yes. When I called back to schedule the pick up I was told they would do the pick up for $75 instead of $110! Service pick up was quick and the movers were very knowledgeable. Thank you Junk King!<//text>< pictures>

I called the Junk King up and it was really easy. It was easy to schedule a time. Everyone showed up on time, and called me 20 minutes in advance. The guys were nice (and, as needed in this case, strong). Thanks for the hard work and great service!< /Review>

Even though they were late, they were very apologetic and got the job done. The two guys were very friendly and polite, got right to work and finished quicker than I expected. They were conciensious of things in path to haul hot tub out of yard and worked well with communication to each other. Thank you Junk King, I’m a happy customer!< /Review>

<Review>I appreciated the flexibility of your service to reduce pick up cost, of my mattress. Also much appreciated the email confirmation, as well as the phone call prior to pickup. Your follow up and follow through are to be commended. I would certainly use your services again, and highly recommend your company to others. AG in San Jose<//Review>< UserId.>

<Review>They were on time within the appointment window, and called before they arrived to give an eta on how far they were out. The gentlemen who arrived were courteous and just a pleasure to work with. They were super quick in picking up our junk, and before I knew it, they were done! I would definitely use their services again.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fcb892427059b:0x8922b0be32424b9< /GmapID></record>

<Review>Using Junk King was so very easy, I made my appointment online.  They came during the time I had requested and gave me the total cost.  They took everything away quickly and neatly.  I thought the price was reasonable.  The two men who came were very personable and respectful.  I would use them again.< /Review>< Response>

The pick up was easy to set up. I was given a time range for the next day. I got a call when the team was about 15 minutes away.They were courteous, fast, and willing to carry a sofa downstairs.  Payment was easy since it was done online.<//Review>

< Review>
Last week I loaded up my tiny Ford Ranger pick-up and went to the dump. The complete trip took just over two hours. The dump fees were $53.44. I was tired of going to dump and was desperately seeking an alternative. With Junk King, now I have a great alternative to doing this myself. These guys called in the morning to let me know when they would arrive. They arrived on time, were clean cut, and pleasant. They smiled, introduced themselves, and shook my hand. Before starting the project, they made sure to fully understand my needs, offered me a price, and wrote it down. I filled up a quarter of their truck and it took them only about 15 minutes to load everything up from the pile out front of the house. They swept up the driveway and then asked me if there was anything else they could do. I like these guys and will use them again.<//Review>

<Response>None</Response><rating>5<//rating><text>I called Junk King last night to inquire about a possible haul after a bathroom remodel. The representative was very personable, but still professional. She informed me that the truck would arrive the next day between 8-10 AM. I received a call at 8:22 AM that the crew was 15-20 mins away. The lead provided me a quote and began the removal. I had to leave before they finished, so the lead offered to send me pictures once the job was completed. He stuck to his word. I would recommend Junk King to anyone. Very professional, flexible, honest, and hard working.< /text></record>

This is the second time I have scheduled trash pickup with Junk Kings - they are very courteous and professional. What took me two days to pull up was gone, cleaned and swept up in less than 30 minutes. They can’t be beat. I also appreciated the pre-arrival call. They came early in the timeframe allotted so I could get on with my day.

I will call them again as I continue to purge spaces in my home!</Review>

Your crew called me 20 minutes before they arrived & were at my house in 22 minutes (which is amazing!), and in exactly 15 minutes, everything was taken care of (process explanation, junk load-up, payment and emailed receipt)! Plus your services were almost $200 less than the GOT-JUNK guys, and you hauled away more stuff! I will recommend you to everyone I know for your services, and look forward to using you again soon.<//review>

Although the truck was late for my appointment window, the driver and dispatcher were both very communicative and kept me updated about the situation. I understand that things happen and sometimes schedules don't work out; keeping me in the loop about the changing schedule made the situation OK. When the truck arrived, the driver and his coworker explained the payment methods and removed my junk quickly. I would definitely use Junk King again.<//Review>

You guys were very conscientious about making sure you didn't grab the wrong stuff. You showed up when you said you would, both for the estimate and the removal, and were pleasant guys who worked efficiently.< /Text>

To describe my experience in one word - WOW! My husband had contacted several companies to try and get the pile of soil removed from our driveway. Nobody was willing to even quote the project. I took over and contacted Junk King by texting a picture of the pile. I received a response immediately and was able to schedule an appointment for a free quote that day! Junk King would have taken the pile that same day too if it hadn’t poured rain (causing the dirt to be too heavy for removal). We rescheduled for a couple days later (recommended by Junk King due to the weather). I cannot day enough how happy I am with my experience with Junk King. Would absolutely use their service again! Thank you Junk King!!<//review>

1. Every time I called, they answered the phone on the first ring.
2. They were able to accommodate my time window for the next day.
3. They were there when they said they would be there.
4. The price was VERY reasonable.
5. The guys that did the work were very personable and professional.
Bottom line, they did what they said they would at a very fair price.< /review>

We had a house that was packed full of 20 years worth of furniture, clothing, and clutter. I met Shane Lopez and David Torres who were very professional. They came and removed all the trash and helped sweep and clean the rooms. I'm Very happy with the service provided. It also helps that the company has the best pricing around! Will definitely use again.</Review>

<review>Your crew called me 20 minutes before they arrived & were at my house in 22 minutes (which is amazing!), and in exactly 15 minutes, everything was taken care of (process explanation, junk load-up, payment and emailed receipt)! Plus your services were almost $200 less than the GOT-JUNK guys, and you hauled away more stuff! I will recommend you to everyone I know for your services, and look forward to using you again soon.< /review><rate>5<//rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

Louise was excellent! He had two employee's with him today. They did a great job. They cleared my dad's office. He was in business as an architect for over 50 years! I appreciate how professional Louise was from start to finish. He has excellent customer service. He called in advance of my appointment for a quote and the appointment today. I was really impressed with Junk King from start to finish. Thank you so much!!! Monica< /Review>

Great Service!  Reasonable quote.  When presented other competitor's quote, Junk King was able to beat it and provide a lower quote.  Arrived on time. Promptly removed the item and clean up afterwards.  Guys that worked on the job were friendly and eager to get it done nicely!Definitely recommend Junk King's junk removal service!<//text>

Timely, professional and friendly.  These guys were great.  My company had moved offices and needed to get rid of the last random bits of our old office equipment and trash from the move.  I was able to set my appointment on short notice, they hauled away the same day after giving me a quote that fit perfectly in our budget.  I would use them again no question.</text>

Junk King is an excellent way to clean Debris  from  any job site . They are always on time and have the manpower to clean up any area in a short time .  Their pricing is very very reasonable ,  The owner of the company I work for says that this is the best way to go rather than renting a large dumpster .
We are very pleased that we found Junk King .<//text>

Great service, would definitely use them again.  Booked online.  They were on-time (actually, they were able to come about 30 min earlier than the chosen window, and confirmed that the time change was OK with a phone call), friendly, and courteous.  I had more to remove than I originally thought, but they were able to take it all - I asked the gentleman on the phone what would happen if they didn't have enough room and he assured me that if they couldn't take it all, they would make two trips.  Cost was really good.  They do an estimate when they get there, before starting removal, to ensure you're OK with the price.  Those guys are strong and fast!  Amazing the way they can toss around debris and heft this giant wood pallet I had to get rid of .  And neat too - they even swept up the garage where the pile of stuff was when they were done.  Very happy with their service and would recommend them to others.<//text>

This service was so quick and easy. I texted photos of my junk and asked for a quote. I scheduled someone to come to a look provide an estimate and remove junk if the pricing was acceptable. I received a call 15 minutes prior to arrival and  the crew arrived on time. Pricing was competitive so I went ahead and asked for junk removal. The crew was friendly and professional making sure to ask if there were any items I may have wanted to keep. Would recommend this service to anyone with tons of things to remove. Thank you!</Text>

Service is Fast and Reliable.  What's not to like.

I've used Junk King maybe 10 times over the past 2 years and the quality of service has remained consistent.  I will definitely use them again.</Text>

The team was professional, courteous and on-time.  They explained clearly the pricing, the options and the plan for hauling the junk away and worked with me every step of the way.  I could not have asked for a better experience.  The online pricing and appointment confirmation system worked without any hidden costs or vague details and is really appreciated compared to other options out there who try to make it difficult to get a straight-forward pricing plan.</Text>

Just got off the phone with this arrogant person. He left a message, saying he's in my area and is 3 hours early, which is fine, and can pick up my mattress. I call back and say: "Sure! Oh, you guys take credit right?" - Him: "The thing with credit is that we have to write down the number because our (whatever he said) is broken." - Me: "Oh? Then can you come in like an hour so I can go to the bank?" - Him: "But we're in your area now." Me: "So, it's my fault you guys are 3 hours early?" Him: "No." Me: "Had I not called you back, would you have shown up at my scheduled time?" He tries to do a runaround, so I repeat my question. He eventually says: "Yes." Me: "There you go. I'm not having a stranger just write down my credit information on some piece of paper. I'll use someone else. Thanks." And I advise you doing the same. What a joke.< /Review>

I would rate the service at 5 stars or more  The guys were prompt, efficient and extremely patient with a very stressed out customer (me).  Even swept clean the sidewalk area where the junk had been piled.  Well worth the cost of the service.  You get what you pay for.  In this case, even more than I expected.🤗</review>

Junk King was very professional and courteous. They showed up early to remove some old appliances that I needed taken away. I will use them again in the near future.<//Text>

Just got off the phone with this arrogant person. He left a message, saying he's in my area and is 3 hours early, which is fine, and can pick up my mattress. I call back and say: "Sure! Oh, you guys take credit right?" - Him: "The thing with credit is that we have to write down the number because our (whatever he said) is broken." - Me: "Oh? Then can you come in like an hour so I can go to the bank?" - Him: "But we're in your area now." Me: "So, it's my fault you guys are 3 hours early?" Him: "No." Me: "Had I not called you back, would you have shown up at my scheduled time?" He tries to do a runaround, so I repeat my question. He eventually says: "Yes." Me: "There you go. I'm not having a stranger just write down my credit information on some piece of paper. I'll use someone else. Thanks." And I advise you doing the same. What a joke.< /text>

I liked that we were notified of when and how long before the truck would arrive to pick up our items, also liked that it was same day service. The guys who picked up our items were friendly and courteous and removed the items quickly and fairly quietly as well. We have used them in the past (2013) and will no doubt use their services again. Thank you.</text>

<review>Junk King is great! I constantly hear the commercials for 1800**otherservice** on the radio but their initial quote was way to high and their operator/sales kept pushing their service and wouldn't let me end the phone call.  Scheduled with Junk King for next day pickup and their base fee was reasonable and their higher rates much more affordable than their competitors.  Would recommend to anyone looking to clear out unwanted trash and items.< /review>< user>

I had the need for the unique services provided by Junk King among other companies in that business, but I chose Junk King because they had the best prices and I had the best experiences with their phone representative.
I was extremely pleased to find that the personnel who arrived to remove my items were not only personable, but did their very best to meet any extra needs of their customers. I highly recommend Junk King to anyone who needs to de-clutter their personal environment.<//Text>

I was very satisfied. First, I had called another Junk place and they wanted to charge almost double just to pick up one appliance. Second, they were able to come an hour earlier on the schedule pick-up day.<//Review>

<text>Junk King came quickly. They gave me a general bid once I sent a picture. Once they arrived, we diacussed what needed to be tossed, a mix of construction debris, wood, and granite. Fair pricing, excellent service, very professional. Wuickly clean up. So nice to have all of my junk gone! Highly recommend them.<//text><response>None< /response><userid>113089322697786424079<//userid><user_name>Sanjit Chadha< /user_name><time>1526408455064</time></record></dataset><record>

I would highly suggest using another company. I had a 12:00pm to 2:00pm appointment scheduled for today and no one showed up. I called five times from 1:30pm to 3:30pm and was promised a follow up phone call all five times. No one called me back. Very Unprofessional. I have used them in the past for junk pick up on four different properties that I manage and have had other issues with the amount they charged, pushing for a tip and late arrival times. It is Friday afternoon at 4:00pm and I am left scrambling to find junk pick up for a full truck. I will never use them again.< /review>

<Review>Luis and his team mate were on time, courteous, actively seeking solutions to unforeseen problems, and thoroughly cleaned up after the job. The job turned out to be more than initially estimated because the Jacuzzi was half buried in the ground and the space was back filled with sand. They worked with me with ideas to remove as much material as feasible at a reasonable charge, about $90 more than the initial estimate, which is fair and not excessive. In addition, Luis offered to remove any remaining materials free of charge should I need at a later time. I am very pleased with their professionalism. I'd highly recommend them.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This is the third time I’ve hired Junk King. The team arrived on time, acted professionally, did exactly what was asked and worked promptly.  I would recommend them to anyone needing to clear a space of debris.< /text>

Junk King were very prompt and called before showing up at my house. They took old furniture, clothes and my recycling backlog which is a great load off of my mind. Would not hesitate to call them again.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I contacted them by sending an email via their link on the website home page. This was my first time inquiring about their services and didn't know if I'd get a fairly quick reply or any at all. As prompted I made an appointment for a two-hour time window the very next morning (10am-12pm) and it was about 430pm when I sent this initial message.
I was pleased to see a very timely reply to my email saying that my appointment was confirmed for the next morning. It also said I would would receive a call from their driver about 20 min. before they arrived at my address. I had a few items to be picked up by them and was curious about the potential cost so I was pleased to find an 'estimator-type' tool on their webpage. It was easy to use and soon had a rough idea of what I'd be paying. I'd initially planned on loading up my small-bed truck with this stuff to take to the dump but found out it would have quite expensive to 'dump' these items directly at a local place. I figured, heck, it's going to be pricey anyway so I'll see how this Junk King thing works out.
I was glad I did. They called me 20 min into my two-hour appointment window and said they'd be there in about 20-25 min. They were prompt and professional as the three guys got out of their truck and followed me to my backyard. They quickly gave me an estimate which was more than fair and hustled the stuff away. I got a receipt via email as they said would. I paid less cash than if I took care of the junk myself and gave them a nice tip for their great service. Good job, guys!<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I called the day before and gave all details of the item I needed taken away, they gave me a quote that sounded great but when the movers showed up they said "oh no those guys aren't supposed to give quotes over the phone" and told me the price they would charge was more than double the price I was quoted. Feels like a scam. They show up to your house and bump the price so you feel on the spot to accept the new price. I would not trust this company<//text>< rate>

Feels like a scam. They show up to your house and bump the price so you feel on the spot to accept the new price. I would not trust this company< /Text>< Resp>

Junk King did a great job of hauling away all of the stuff--furniture, old fridge, various boxes and bags of junk--that we needed to clean out because we were selling our house. Fast, thorough, clean, efficient--a great service.< /Review>

Wonderful business allowing unsafe drivers to drive at high rates of speed through a residential neighborhood. Will they haul the child away after they kill them?

I was very pleased with the service received from Junk King. The gentlemen called ahead, arrived on time and were polite and very professional.  The fees charged were what was quoted by phone...and that process was equally professional.  I would contact them again!< /Text>
