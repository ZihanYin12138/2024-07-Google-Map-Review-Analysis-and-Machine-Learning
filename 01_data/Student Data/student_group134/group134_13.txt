Great experience. Only complaint is when I called ahead of time the woman looked up my information and said they will definitely honor my replacement plan insurance I paid for. Of course, when I went to buy new frames they magically refused to honor it. The lady over the phone looked up exactly my date of purchase l, DOB, and plan and says unequivocally that my protection replacement plan would be honored. Personally, I feel that they definitely should have honored it instead of reversing their position on something that was crystal clear. Its bad business but what can u do, right?< /Review>

The doctor was super nice and informative. But Lulu made my whole experience so enjoyable. I was exhausted from work and he helped me pick out the cutest frames and helped me save money. He definitely knew his stuff and I would go back to that location specifically for him. Thanks Lulu!</review>

<text>Luis and Dr. Bertram were very helpful and informative during my visit. I went to get my yearly insured pair and it seemed like it was their first day opening again during this whole COVID-19 time, so hats of to them for maintaining new health standards and ensuring good care and customer service. Dr. Bertram gave me good tips on how to keep my eyes healthy, and Luis was professional, diligent, and sociable. Thanks again! -Todd< /text>< pics>

Dr. Griener was very very nice and thorough. So far, today was our best experience with the optometrist and the eye exam. Also, the gentleman who helped us with glasses was very helpful. We told us about AAA discount and we were able to save and didn’t have to go to Costco.  Best experience ALL AROUND</review>

Today I scheduled an appointment online using my phone and was able to walk-in in less than an hour after scheduling.  After a few minutes of walking around and looking at frames I was greeted and given paperwork to fill out.  Every person I dealt with was super helpful, polite and professional.  I was seen by Dr Tien and she was very nice and thorough.  I was in and out of the office/store in less than an hour with prescription in hand. I would definitely recommend this place.</review>

<review>Dr. Tien did a great job at the Irvine Marketplace location. She went way over and above to help me with my contact lens fitment.  I have a severe astigmatism and it took several fitments before finding the pair that would fit best. She took her time and treated me like I was the only patient she had to see. The whole team was very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this location.<//review>< pictures>

Good service and friendly. After continuous(4) years of utilizing this exact office it is just so frustrating to have to fill out complete paperwork every single time when they have everything on file. Such a waste of time every time.<//text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>I came away very distraught because of the way that everything was "handled". I went in with a pair of glasses that had been made for me at the same location just last year. Because of my particular condition and my vision changing, they just never worked well for me. I still love the frames, so I decided to go back in and have them reworked. What a laugh! They quoted me right at $500, and this was after the $75 optometrist appointment, where they insisted on performing tests that I had just completed at Kaiser. I felt like a dollar sign, not a valued client!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1501963093519, 'text': "Thank you for sharing your concerns with us.

Well when I went to the store I had an appointment at 12 I went in 45 minutes early to have my glasses checked and every time a person came in the door the gentleman helping me would get up and hand them a clipboard and ask them to fill out stuff then he come back to me then another person come in and he would go help them then he came back to me so I asked him can you finish with me first since I have an appointment and he says well I have to kinda watch people coming in so I didn't think that was good customer service<//review>

Dr. Keith Wong was very kind and patient and spent a lot of time with me. He went above and beyond my expectations in terms of friendliness and proactively consulted with me regarding my ocular allergies even though it was just a simple lens prescription checkup. The other employees were also very friendly. It was a wonderful, welcoming atmosphere.</review>

Very clean and organized. Had everything I needed for my costume idea. Staff was friendly too. In an old Borders bookstore which I was surprised to see since the closed up their stores back in 2011. (I know I used to work for Borders)< /text>

<text>They had a lot of cute stuff left considering Halloween is next week but I didn't appreciate being yelled and and threatened to be kicked out by employees every 5 minutes. She literally stands in the middle of the store to yell at you about trying things on and threatening to kick everyone out if someone breaks the rules. Do they not have a speaker phone or a written note to read from at least? Made the whole experience so uneasy.< /text><userid>103667392770415251139< /userid><Date>1603563690017</Date>< Rating>

The ladies working here were extremely rude,now I know why there wasn’t any people inside the store. Please train your employees on how to speak to customers. This was an awful experience!!! They didn’t have good customer service skills when I walked in they didn’t even acknowledge me!<//Review>

I wish they had stores like this all year. This one is you think you're every October at least it's been for the past few years always love coming here for Halloween time they have great stuff the only problems are that some stuff is way overpriced and sometimes the staff isn't the best but they're probably like I'm only here for about a month or two so they don't put too much effort but the store looks awesome all the time and they have great stuff.</Text>

<Text>We came to this location at 10:20pm, the location advertises its hours online as 9am-11pm. When we got to the store the doors were locked and the staff inside were ignoring us until we knocked on their door, then the lady with orange curly hair moulthed "closed" to us and when we showed her our phones saying their site says they close at 11pm the lady simply gave us a incredibly rude and condescending thumbs up, we drove from Burbank to Pasadena immediately after work to try and make it in time to buy two exact costumes, because of her lack of customer service we will never be shopping spirit again.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Great location in quite neighborhood.  This building has historical value to the Mormon church as one of their synagogues or as it is called a temple.  It is a place of worship and greater light and understanding what people need to do while on this earth.< /review>

Keep in mind, this is not a big custom designed temple with all the gardens and lights and greeting missionaries that you might find at Oakland or San Diego, but it’s what we needed close to home. Special place.</review>< Pics>

<review>One of the best places on Earth! (as the are only 150+ LDS temples in the world). They are not usually open to the public other than for the following: open houses just after building completions and/or renovations, the grounds and visitors centers are open for anyone during normal operating hours. The atmosphere is always peaceful as the grounds and design/ decorations inside and out are peaceful, reverent, and breathtaking!</review><Name>Eric Willams</Name>< response>

<text>I got my endowments here so good. When I would come and do baptisms here with my family it meant the world to me. This is one of the only places I can go to find peace.
One time I think I sat in here for almost an hour after one of the ordinances. Lots of my siblings got sealed to their spouses for eternity in this building.<//text>< Pics>

Has a very tight and small sparking lot but it is well worth the amazing food I got the chicken and cheese was super hot to order and great amazing taste it also came with the option for grilled onions. Very easy and basic menu to order from also the food is cooked super fast and there is very little wait time, also the restraunt is handicap friendly!< /Text>

<Text>We come here all the time. My daughter loves this place just as much as I do. We have been getting the Philly cheese steak for years now and are always excited to come. We drive from Lake Elsinore to get it and it’s worth.

Service is always great. Food is always top notch. I do wish they had the old fries tho. But other then that I would recommend this place.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great staff and friendly service:) The basic cheese steak is so good with their cheese fries. When i had togo of cheesefries they give cheese in a dip container so fries didn’t get soggy😇 Great attention to details! The cook was really nice! You can just feel that right away💓 - i hate soggy fries, everybody has that experience when you had fries togo<//review>

<review>DONT ORDER CHICKEN PARMESAN.
We got 3 samwhichs tonight. The cheesesteak and ham & cheese was great but the chicken parmesan looked and tasted like it was precooked days ago then thrown in the deep fryer agian for the order...
Practically burnt, dry and rubbery, and generally gross. Agian clearly precooked days ago then carelessly thrown in a fryer.
If I would have known it would have been like that I wouldn't have gotten it to begin with. With the reviews I expected a proper chicken parm samwhich....<//review>< Response>

The food is good but hands down the best cook in town.  He remembers your name, the way you like your sandwich and always greets you with a smile and handshake.  He is only reason I continue to go back!!</review>

<text>Always a favorite...great sandwiches and quick made to order food ! They reduced the amount of met they put in the sandwiches and kept the same price. They now offer extra meet for an additional price which is a backhanded way to up the prices, still a great meal hot and fast ! Will definitely be going back.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>FOLLOW-UP VISIT:
So, a couple of weeks after my first post, I am back at the Mira Loma location and I am happy to report that the cleanliness is much improved. The condiment bar is clean and fully stocked. The bathroom is still old and in need of repair (the sink still leaks), but it's really clean this time. The food is great. The service is friendly and efficient.

Maybe I came after a dinner rush or with brand new employees who are still learning. Either way, much better this time.

The only critique I have is that the Chino Hills location has a frequent diner card, but I didn't feel like driving that far with the holiday traffic. Other than that, I am satisfied.

If this location fixes the bathroom sink and adds a frequent diner card then I will never have a reason to go to the Chino Hills location.

INITIAL VISIT (2 STARS): The staff is was very friendly but the condiment bar is unattractive and not well stocked. The bathroom sink leaks (more like pours onto the floor). My order wasn't entirely correct but the onion ring portion was larger than the Philly's Best in Chino. That said the one in Chino has a frequent diner stamp card, the staff is also nice, the manager is not, and their condiment bar is more attractive and the restaurant is cleaner overall.</text></record>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>Omg ordered the chicken with mushrooms and grilled onions what a disappointment so dry no cheese no mushrooms very lucky to have gotten a little bit of grilled onions.  Spent 36 bucks.  Wouldn't have said anything but this is the 2nd time I've called in a order and they messed it up.  Philly's best your all about the cheese otherwise you are no different from del taco except for your prices. Nothing worse than getting home and finding out your order is not right but to have a extremely dry sandwich is too much.  Ended up throwing it out and only ate the onion rings and a bowl of cereal for dinner.  😢😢</review>< Pics>

My experience here was not the best. I mentioned to the staff workers that I am from Philadelphia so I know my food would taste exactly like the food in the city (which it didn’t btw) but then The staff workers working that shifted mocked me then started to laugh like it was a joke. I let it fly but they weren’t the nicest people. They were very rude and you could tell they didn’t want to be there. You guys should hire people who actually want to give customers a great experience.< /Text>

<review>3.5 for me, closer to a 4 than a 3. I was in the area and whet here at the request of a friend that really enjoyed this place. A small background on me, I don’t eat very many fruits or vegetables, I just ordered a plain cheese steak meat and cheese which is probably different than others order.. I also ordered one order of fries.. both came out to around $10, average prices.. When I got the food it was for sure above average tasting but again just meat and cheese, small-medium portions, the French fries tasted store bought and very obviously under cooked.. solid place to mix it up for me and others RAVE about it.< /review>< Pics>

Food is great...We love the food and go often. The cook is always friendly and helpful.  The counter girl cashier needs some customer  service training. She has a bad attitude,  and is rude most of the times we've gone there, not friendly  at all...you'd  think she would be nicer since we're  there so often...and smile for goodness sake!</text>

The food here is amazing! Great meat, no bs. The staff is very attentive and are always willing to help out. It's an awesome lunch spot for sure. They do have beers(bottles)
If you want a small slice of Philly in Cali this is a must try! Have to be careful you dont over eat!😁< /Review>

I have eaten here numerous times, but lately, the cook, and the cashier seem to be playing a little scam with the meat. I have caught the numerous cooks that seem to flow in and out of there, purposely skimming the meat. While I am paying the cashier, I have caught the cooks, a couple of them, putting half, or smaller portions of that frozen meat on the grill. They try to dice it up as quickly as possible so the customer wont notice the shortage. One time I ordered TWO "Rocky" specials from the cashier. The cook was in back, so the female cashier put two single servings of the frozen meat on the grill. A "Rocky" special is double meat per sandwich, so she should have put FOUR single portions of frozen meat on. If you go there, make sure you watch that cook put the correct portion of meat on the grill before he starts chopping it up so you dont notice you have been shorted. Funny thing, the owner has cameras everywhere. I guess he would claim he had'nt noticed.</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I really like the sandwich here, it's super delicious! Every time I return to the US, I must come! Pastrami and steak sandwiches are very punctual! It’s delicious with the bite of jalapeno! With fried and crispy onion rings! I really can't eat so delicious in Taiwan! !

(Original)
非常喜歡這裡的三明治，超級好吃！每次回美國一定要來！pastrami 跟牛排三明治都很正點！跟著墨西哥辣椒這一口那一口的，美味極了！配上炸的又香又酥脆的洋蔥圈⋯天啊！在台灣真的吃不到這麼好吃的啊！！</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Also perfect trail, if you run on the ridge, to train steep climbs and downhills.< /Review></record>

<review>Great place for photo ops and a nice hike.. the path is 3.9 miles from start to park and an elevation gain of 666' more if you take the side hills and ramp up the intensity a bit.. parking sux and the homeowners hate the cars parking on the street..
The trail is wide and you can socially distance fairly easy, most were wearing mask< /review>< UserId.>

Just an absolutely fantastic trail.  Head here earlier in the day if you want to beat the crowds as it gets quite busy on most weekend days.  Also parking can be a bit rough, so don't be surprised if you have to park a ways away.< /review>

We LOVE this trail for our pup to run off-leash.  Warning: Rattle Snake was near the trail today!!  We heard the rattle and saw the snake about 15' up the embankment. Thank Goodness!<//Text>

Great views of LA. The hard part is getting up here :) Riding up on the bike is challenging as i found out :)  Once here, you can just enjoy the views, walk or ride up mandeville-fire road (not paved) all the way up to Mullholland Dr.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Nice trail with great views of DTLA and the ocean. The trail is basically 2 in 1; one trail is quite flat while the other is very hilly and great for a workout. A great secret of West LA as the trail is never very crowded. Free parking in the neighborhood.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcPrZJ0D_DQjpy4vRJlqMDvY4N4hvoh2Y5Ex9e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAKuDcJX9dWztLNQBBrQixtHnaURWU4tFowWKL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXFZ5q2SAE66KfBjMkn9eB85RCk4AENRlAPs6x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJenkDH3pc3QE075qAbQy3bmVy7A-_ND9Dv1tz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

Well kept fire road trail with side trail options if you want extra elevation. Hikers with dogs are common here and always clean up after themselves. To the Nike missile launch site and back is about 7.4 miles.</review>

Unlike the whoops, which is a roller coaster ride, this trail winds it’s way gradually up the side of the ridge with gorgeous views of LA down below.  Parking is limited but you can park on the street just outside the gates.  It’s a long winding drive to get up here but well worth it.</review>

One of my top 5 favorite trail running spots.  Nontechnical route, but challenging none the less.  3.5 miles one way almost entirely up with a couple welcome declines mixed in.  There is water and a bathroom at the top (which is also the junction of Dirt Mulholland and doesn’t have to be the turn around point as this trail connects to the “hub” of the Santa Monica Mountains trail network and the backbone trail eventually).  But for most after 3.5 miles you will reach the turnaround point which is the site of the old Nike Missile silo from the Cold War era, enjoy the view and get ready for a fast decent!  Up and down twice makes for a nice 14 mile effort and a great excuse for a nice brunch!<//Text>

I haven't hiked since I was a kid and this was a mellow hike with scenic views... hold, ocean, and city. I recommend going before sunset as watching the sun dip below the horizon presents a colorful sky.< /text>

I love the trail for what it is. Hills for climbing on one side and a low path tracing it. Parking can be a hassle at peak hours but trail traffic is never cumbersome. Shared between bikes foot traffic so keep your eyes and ears open. If you bring your dog be sure to bring water and please pick up after yourself.< /Text>

<Text>Trail rules specify that off-leash dogs must be under *immediate* verbal control. Instead, multiple dogs were allowed to run up to us and our dog after we clearly pulled off to the side to allow everyone a safe, responsible passage. Trail itself looked to be fun but because of others' lack of respect, we won't be back.</Text><username>Zaelyna B. (Zae)</username>< Date>

Very easy trail that if you just follow the widest trail, you won't get lost. The final point has a restroom and almost 360 degree view. Its about eight miles back and forth total with gentle slope.  You can see up to Palos Verses and the ocean in the beginning. Then later you will see Encino on one side and downtown on the other side. No shade is there at all.</text>

This place (Westridge Trail Head) is a great hike for dogs and their humans. Dogs can be off leash (humans too!). I especially enjoy it at this time of the evening when there is moonlight. The Fireroad is wide and smooth and most people have left. If there's enough light, you can even take the ridges for a better workout. But as always when in the mountains, don't do this alone especially at and after dusk. Coyotes, bobcats and mountain lions call these hills home.< /Review>

This trail is fine if you're looking for something easy and simple. A good place to walk a dog or go on a stroll with small children. Limited parking so that's something to be prepared for.< /review>

<Review>Most dog owners are irresponsible, from our experience. Trail rules dictate only dogs that can be verbally controlled off leash, are allowed off leash. That did not stop most people from allowing their "friendly" dogs romp around antagonizing other dogs.

It's a beautiful place. Bring lots of water. Dogs may need shoes on some trails because of sharp rock gravel and loose shale.</text>

Great, long, dog friendly hike with awesome views. Very clean but cons are there are no garbage cans once you get more than a mile into the trail, so be prepared to carry your dog's poo for a while.< /Review>

This hike is generally a good one but only during winter. The problem with doing this one in Summer or even Spring is the amount of flies. There are a lot of dog walkers and the dog poop attracts flies which really detract from an otherwise pleasant hike if 7.3 miles.<//Text>

Lots of people access this trailhead compared to the early 90s when I first started riding up westridge. Full of cars & dog walkers now. I never park here any more, I just ride past the crowds.<//Text>

I hope they don't change that here. moderately steep hike. many people run it. mountain bikes are often present, so keep your animals close to you, preferrably on a leash<//Text>< pictures>

This is my favorite hike! I've been to Mandeville over 10 times with my dog. The park is usually filled with other dogs off leash and bikers doing some crazy workouts. On a clear day you can get a nice view of the city and the beach.</Text>

I had a morning coffee here. The coffee was amazing! I had a cold brew, and it didn't disappoint me at all. The sandwiches were great, and I can customize them and satisfied with the results. They also run workshops, and you can even buy their beans to take home. I strongly recommend this place!< /text>

The breakfast sandwiches are exceptionally good. And the coffee...so good. So so good. They are actual artists. It's not just some machine mixing drinks. Really stellar environment and product.
It's also the first coffee shop I've ever been to where an employee came by and said, "if the coffee isn't how you want it, let me know and we can adjust it how you want it."</text>

I actually came here a couple weeks back.  I like the owner and their service.  Especially their service.  Ordered, sat down, and they brought our food to us.  Nice atmosphere, real cozy.  Good food, decent prices, boba's iffy, milk tea's great.</text>

Coffee was good, but the food was not. The meat in the sandwich was a bit dry and they put wayy too much jam in it to the point where it's basically a dessert and not a savory sandwich anymore. Employees were friendly though.<//Review>

<Text>I was craving a chai latte and this happens to be two blocks from my apartment.  I try to buy local before going to a chain coffee shop but it's fair to say I wont be coming back. The latte was ok, the breakfast sando was ok. When I got there my sando was ready, coffee was not. I waited outside for around 5-8 mins.  While I was waiting I saw the barista preparing a coffee but there's no way for me to know it was mine. They didn't yell out a name. There were three employees and one bothered to ask me if I was waiting for something, but they sure talked amongst themselves and while looking right at me.  Will walk to Starbucks next time cause honestly, you cant beat consistency in service and taste of drinks. What a shame.</Text><username>Fernanda Loustaunau</username>< UserId.>

Really you're everyday corner coffee shop. The staff were super friendly and are implementing the covid regulations for sure. You can walk in order and wait outside. There are some seats out there so its pretty cool. They specialize in pour over coffee so I highly recommend to step out of the normal and try something different.

We ordered the a pour over with a splash of almond milk. Man was it delicious. I believe it was a southern mexican bean. Can't remember the name. But they rotate as they should be. We also got a vanilla iced latte and that was super yummy. It hit the spot while walking around the city.<//Text>

Some of the BEST coffee  I've tasted! I ran out of coffee at home so needed a little boost to jump start my day, and this was such a delicious treat! I had vanilla latte for my morning, and ordered the Mt. Laguna sandwich for lunch later in the day, and I have to say.. it was one of my favorite sandwiches I have had in a long time. Thank you so much for being open and taking the time and care to make such wonderful, healthy meals! I guarantee you will be seeing me order from you for pickup and delivery many more times and when this quarantine is over, spending time at your coffee shop. Thank you again!!<//Review>

Best pour-over coffee ever! I had the San Ysidro, and it's velvety smooth. That with one of the breakfast sandwiches will start your day right. Take your order to go or stay at the cafe.  There's more seating than appears from the exterior. Although very busy, the workers are knowledgeable and friendly, too, providing A-1 service.  Highly recommend!</Text>

<Review>Delish coffee roasted a few blocks away right in downtown SD. Nice outdoor space including umbrellas for those too-sunny days. Pets welcome.

Staff mostly pleasant. Waits can be long at peak times (mornings ....) They have a nice selection of pastries including my fave a gluten-free pistachio cakelette.

Smells like bacon when I walked over today tempting me .... a few breakfast and lunch options.

Fair prices. Nice place to sit and watch downtown walk by</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I got the Bankers Hill breakfast sandwich (turkey/bacon/egg with arugula and fig jam) and it was absolutely delicious, among the better breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. The nitro cold brew was also great! Their seating situation currently is all outdoor, next to the sidewalk, which is a nice al fresco dining experience.
I'm definitely coming back here soon, the service was friendly and the wait was reasonable given the circumstances.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80d954a68e5b5309:0x80205538f563c707</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Cute little coffee shop with great food! We did wait a bit for our food, but it’s small, so just be prepared if you are in a rush with a larger group (we had 6 people) all ordering sandwiches. We sat outside and it was great- will for sure be back when in San Diego !</Text>< pics>

Gotta be honest, this coffee is incredible. Better than Calabria - get a bag of Mt Soledad and grind it yourself - you are welcome< /review>

<review>As good as the other location... I had a strong, pour-over halfcaf with one of seasonal drinks and the cereal. Surprisingly, the cereal was great! Staff members were helpful and friendly. A lot of seating (inside and out) compared to the other location. I ate inside and enjoyed SD mid-day, almost 70 degree weather. Rough life, I know. Also of note, they will be opening a third location soon! Excited to check it out on a return trip back<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80d954a68e5b5309:0x80205538f563c707<//GmapID></record>

<Text>I loved this place, it is a good spot to enjoy your coffee and work quietly. I found very interesting that they sell the same coffee beans they use in their beverages, freshly roasted and packed. However, I’d did not really enjoyed my coffee, for a pour over. I was expecting something more extraordinary, such as noticeable flavors and notes as well as the touch of the roast master, but that didn’t happen.<//Text><name>Saúl O López</name></record></dataset><record>

Espresso was excellent and they have a variety of single origin coffees from around the world served as pour over - there's something for everyone. Sandwiches are made with quality breads - a prerequisite for a good sammie. Pleasant interior, simple but comforting; young, sophisticated crowd.
I would recommend this place without any reservations!<//review>< Pictures>

Roast has a nice light flavor with a creamy aftertaste.  Prepared a little too hot, so ask to go light on the steaming.< /review>

One of my favorite places in San Diego for a coffee. Delicious coffees (including some unusual drinks. "The Turk" iced is perfect on a warm day). Great friendly staff. The only thing I hate is their limited opening hours, but my annoyance with that is testament to how much I love them. I'd happily make this place 24hrs if I could!<//review>

<text>It’s my first time in San Diego, actually first time in California and I’m staying downtown... I went out for a walk this morning and passed a coffee shop. And for being a huge coffee lover and trying new places, this is the BEST coffee I have ever had. The workers were very sweet as well. I highly recommend anyone to stop in. I didn’t have any breakfast but it looked and smelled great too!</text><Rate>5< /Rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

Really friendly staff! Also, the best iced black tea I've had. I normally sweeten and add some creamer of sorts, but I didn't add either because it was great on it's own!

They have free WiFi and a rewards program.I also had a latte, which was fire 🔥 and came with foam art !</review>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>Achilles Coffee Roasters is a great example of the perfect weather in San Diego. It's a permanent outdoor coffee stand in downtown San Diego. Since it's at the bottom of an office building, it's a little hard to notice so make sure you have the address.

The staff are friendly and they quickly make your coffee in the morning so you can be on your way. They sell pastries and any type of coffee you want. I ordered a large latte and it comes with four shots in it (one of the strongest lattes I've had!). They have cream and sugar if you need to doctor it up.

They cater to the downtown on-the-go crowd, but there are several outdoor tables if you want to stay awhile and sip on your strong coffee. Why not? The weather is always perfect in San Diego!</text><Response>None< /Response><rating>4< /rating>< userid>

Go to support Achilles if you live within a mile! And if you don't, come in on a Saturday morning for a chat and a pour-over. Best coffee I have had in San Diego, and easily top 5 I've had in all of California. Cute place too, and the service is top tier. Had a great chat every time I came in here, 4 times in a 5 day trip to SD.</Text>

Great breakfast spot with a lot of breakfast egg dishes and brunch sandwiches. I've tried the avocado toast ("Tourmaline"), Eggs Benedict ("Del Mar"), and the vegetarian sandwich ("Coronado"). All were delicious and refreshing. The coffee is roasted in house - cold brew really hits the spot on a warm sunny day (basically every day).<//Review>

Excellent experience! I ordered avocado toast and a latte, and it was delicious! The setting was air conditioned and quiet, with great vibes, great music, and delicious coffee! I was a first time customer, but it won't be my last time! Delicious!< /text>

I live up the street and having a local coffee shop so close is just nice. The smell of coffee roasting in the morning helps me wake up. I get my coffee beans from here and I appreciate that I can bring my own jar for them to fill. The coffee is amazing, our favorite is the Gaslamp blend (dark/medium roast blend). They also have cold brew and pastries.<//Text>

5 stars, lots of space in the back to meet up, good wireless, kinda fanatical about the coffee with a lot of local flair in a cool area just outside of downtown, if you are looking for a regular place to go near downtown to meet up and hang out... clean and the staff is friendly, never too busy just busy enough and has a good vibe. They do a nice flat white.</review>

<text>Espresso tasted delicious! great sandwiches as well! I like that it has comfortable chairs and sofa to relax in the back. The only minor bad thing about this place is that it closes too early at about 3pm.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80d954a68e5b5309:0x80205538f563c707<//Gmap_id><user_id>108130315035526447228< /user_id>< Pictures>

Loved this place. Had a Chai Latte which I loved and my daughter had a hot chocolate which she kept telling me how good it was. The baristas were great and kept making my 4 year old laugh. Wish I lived closer so I could make it my regular coffee place.<//Text>

I visit this coffee shop often and they never fail to give impeccable customer service with delicious coffee to match. I always get the Aztec iced and it is the perfect start to my day! You can taste the high quality coffee in each drink. 10/10 recommend.<//Review>

Place wss nice, but try to train your staff. A guy just thrown knife and fork on the table without saying a word. Maybe you should learn how to talk to your customers first and then call yourself as a good coffee place.</Text>

Some of the best coffee in San Diego! I went here recently when a friend discovered this gem, I swear the beans have something magical going on.. or I've never had coffee this fresh! What a unique flavor profile. I definitely recommend this coffee shop to coffee aficionados!<//Review>

<username>Alejandra Hernandez</username><review>This was the best coffee shop food I've ever had. Nothing was greasy. Everything tasted very freshamd came out quickly. I believe I had the Hillcrest sandwich. It was big enough to fill me up. The coffee was really good. There's wifi and different choices for seeding (tables, couches, armchairs, window bar). I went on a weekday during the afternoon and this place was empty.</review>< gmap_id>

Really cute neighborhood artisnal coffee shop in Cortez Hill.  They roast their own coffee.  Many varieties to chose from.  Friendly staff explain the "notes" and "boquets" in the various blends (felt like I was at a wine tasting!)</Review>

(Translated by Google) The most delicious coffee for me is in this place.
Delicious breakfasts, an entourage place, you can see how the grains are fried.
Friendly staff. I highly recommend visiting if you come to San Diego!

(Original)
Самый вкусный кофе для меня именно в этом месте.
Вкусные завтраки, антуражное место, можно увидеть, как обжариваются зерна.
Дружелюбный персонал. Очень советую к посещению, если приехали в Сан Диего!</text>

I enjoyed going to this location of WSS. It is very large, organized and clean!
They are helpful with the different types of brand of shoes. For example, Nikes I should try a half size smaller for a better fit.<//Review>

Downey she store sent me to the Paramount shoe store stated that the shoes I was looking for were there. Arrive to find out that only to right shoes were there and when they found the left shoe, that shoe was a demo so was faded and didn't match in color. Horrible service after I complained.</Text>

Staff was very helpful.  I came in for some shoes that were on sale but they didn't have my size but they called a nearby store to check.  The other store had them and put them on hold for me.  Good selection and sale prices were very good.  They also have sports related apparel.  Parking was easy</review>

Store is clean, good selection of shoes. But the staff is very rude. And think some staff members are racist. Due to my experience trying to exchange my daughter shoes. Very bad experience will never shop at this location again. The worst staff member is the  security.</text>

(Translated by Google) Because they put specials more expensive than the regular price and if you are going to return it the next day they do not want to because and it is a different price. Excuse you. The most ridiculous thing that happened to me there paid 49.99 0 for a pair and the next day the special ended and cost 24.99 regular price 😳 hahahaha ridiculous

(Original)
Porque ponen especiales mas cara del precio regular y si vas a regresarlo al siguiente dia no quieren porque y es diferente precio Diaculpen usted.lo mas ridiculo que me a pasado ahi pague 49.99 0ñpor un par y al siguente dia se acabo la especial y costaba 24.99 precio regular 😳 jajajaja ridiculo<//Review>

Service no good. The owner rushed to finish the order from phone call and not prepared the food properly. Forgot the rice for one of the lunch order. It's understandable that the owner wants more business but it's rude and disrespectful to the one who is on the phone.< /review>

<Text>My go-to here is the Mango Milk Tea. So many other places make a terrible mango milk tea, but Verde seems to have nailed it. Prices are very good and they offer snacks and desserts as well. I've had the popcorn chicken which comes with sweet potato fries, and their cheesecake. Both are pretty good.

This place can get busy, and there aren't that many seats for big groups (unless you dine-in in their restaurant).< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I have been twice to Verde. In the first time I just stopped by and grab a Mocha to go. The last time I decided to check their dinning area and order a plate. I got myself a Chicken Teriyaki, which took only 10min to be ready. Awesome! I highly recommend. Both times I have been served by happy staff. The place is very clean, organized and has good music!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Food are ok,  price is good. atmosphere is nice.  It's one of my go-to lunch places. This place could get pretty busy during lunch hours. A few of my favorites are the pork chop rice, salmon fried rice, popcorn chicken rice, and the black bean sauce fish with rice. They have good pasta too. Plenty of drinks to choose.</text>

Honestly, I'm a Verde fanatic. I'm crazy about pearl tea in general.

I only get Jasmine tea w/o milk and pearls, so... can't say much for the drinks. I do know some of the slushy/icy things are too sweet. Taro milk tea is good, and strawberry or peach green teas are good.

I used to frequent the old Verde in Cupertino a lot, until it moved to a different area(still in Cupertino). So I began to come here a lot, mostly because of the B1G1 promo they had from 2-5PM and 9-11PM everyday. $4 for 2 drinks or about $10 for 4 is a STEAL. Sadly, this promo is over, they now have their "happy hour" at Buy 2 get 1 free.

The service here could use some work. You're not allowed to sit on  the right side if you're ordering your drinks to go. The right side is the restaurant side-- kind of odd they serve pasta, and rice meals, etc. Haven't really tried it. It's fun to get your pearl tea in a large glass though, if you're dining in.

Overall, decent place to go to if you want to grab a tea. Not a great place to sit and hang around in.< /Text>

<Review>Great price and food. This is a typical bubble tea place with food so you can expect those Taiwanese Bento box items here. I like their popcorn chicken too. Decoration and service are nice too and enough seats even fit family with kids. The only thing I complain is sometimes the table is not that clean. Otherwise the portion they give is great considering the cheap price. Drink is nothing special, mostly syrup and no flavor of tea at all, but if you buy with a meal, they have combo discount. Their ramen topping in bubble tea is unique.< /Review>< time>

The music is nothing but static and radio commercials. If that's not bad enough, it is really loud and it keeps cutting out. It's like the owner doesn't care or maybe never eats here.<//review>

Great service and ambience in the cafe. They have a sit down area like a mini restaraunt, a cool idea for a cafe. Super friendly staff, helping me understand the different types of things they have on the menu.

I had the QQ Boba which felt a lot better to eat than normal boba. It is basically small pearls, which means easier chewing and smoother swallowing. The idea of QQ Ramen was also very cool, boba shaped like noodles. I would definitely come back to try the QQ Ramen.< /review>

<Text>Decent place to get your fix of milk tea. Their MT selection tends to be on the milkier, frothier side.
My personal favorite drink to get every time I come here is the thai iced tea with pearls. The boba just compliments the thai tea flavor so well!

Other than that, it's serviceable. They have decent selection of snack food like fried chicken and tofu, very much the kind of food you would find at the TapXs and the Quicklys of the world. They also offer pasta and other foods as well. But honestly, other than their thai tea and boba combination, you're better off going to Gong Cha for your tea fix.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Terrible service and wait. Standing here at the cashier for over 5 minutes and employees walking by without even greeting us. We then had to wait over 20minutes for our drink and chicken.....and the chicken is soggy and not even hot. Don't visit here if you're trying to get out I'm less than an hr.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Taiwanese dim sum, I can’t think of it in the U.S. You can still taste Taiwanese flavor, but the price is three times more expensive, the U.S. price

Nowadays we can get most everything we need from Amazon but... One day I needed a DVI to VGA adapter fast. Stopped by Konocti Computers to see if I could find one. When the young man couldn't find it on the wall he called the owner for help and finally said he had one out in his car, he came back seconds later and said "it's used but it's yours if you want it" and gave it to me.
Friendly, knowledgeable and kind people in Lakeport< /review>

<text>KONOCTI COMPUTERS IS TOO COOL!   Shawn was so helpful with setting up my computer to my printer he set it up in minutes. They really enjoy computers and it shows. He was so patient and offered suggestions to help me with my new business idea. Free Starburst candy is a Bonus and the Star Trek door sound when you walk in makes you feel you've walked in to the tech zone. I love this store and the people who work there!< /text>< Pics>

{'time': 1571442582719, 'text': 'WOW sorry you felt that way.. IT\'S JUST THAT...when reviewing the surveillance footage your story doesn\'t EXACTLY match the events. Do feel free to contact the owner for clarification. We protect your privacy and did so on that day quite simply. The tech knows what the "settings" icon looks like.  He has been doing this for YEARS.  When YOU move APPS around including your SETTINGS button we need to ask you to pull it up so we don\'t peruse thru your phone. This avails you privacy as we tend to see many things on peoples phones that should remain private. The technician asked you to pull it up because your settings icon had been moved. VERY simply. This does not warrant calling our trained and certified technician inexperienced or lacking experience. This was done for your measure of privacy out of respect for you. Thank you for supporting local business but you could have spoken up while you were in our shop rather or followed up with a call rather than tarnish a hard working company\'s reputation because you didn\'t have full understanding of something. Do you really think we would employ someone who woulndn\'t even know the most basic of tasks?? We think not. :(  Thank you for crushing the spirit of a hard working honest tech rather than speaking up that day, Carol. 😞'}</response>

<text>Absolute MIRACLE WORKERS! I went to another shop in town on Main Street that was advertising a 99 dollar repair special. The repair guy at Turbo Tech Computers completely ruined my phone to the point it was useless. I was devastated to the point of tears and he said nothing to offer a way to fix it! I came in to Konocti Computers and Peter was a life saver!!  He was so nice and POLITE and caring.  I am forever grateful !!  Real professionals! Nice shop with a great energy!!  SUPER RECOMMENDED FOR ANY ONE IN NEED OF GREAT REPAIR!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

My HP laptop got stuck in a startup loop, after trying to fix it for a few days I finally took it in to Konocti Computers to see if they can help me. Jim was very informative and did an excellent job fixing my laptop without loosing any of my files.
I highly recommend Konocti Computers in Lakeport. Thank You Jim

Highly responsive, kind, personable, and intelligent staff who have gone above and beyond the call of duty for myself and family members over the last 7+ years. Claudia and her team have been generous and thorough with their services, meeting a variety of computer challenges- large and small- with great creativity and unsurpassable skill. I whole-heartedly recommend their stellar services.< /review>

<Text>Konocti Computers helped us out! I live in a rural area (just moved here). Couldn't find internet service. I brought my laptop in since it was slow. Not only did they fix it and it's running great but they were able to refer me to the only internet service in my area. We are up and running and connected! Really impressed!!!!!!!</Text>< rate>

This is not your ordinary computer repair store. These people are amazing. They are honest and make you feel like a valued person. The store is clean and you wont get a better price in Lake County on the repair costs and items for sale. They give out free Starburst candies and bottled water- cable tv in th3e waiting area and a restroom. Classiest repair place i've ever seen. I love going to Konocti Computers.< /Text>

I trust Konocti Computers with the repair of all my tech devices. They are real repair experts in my opinion! Going any where else is a waste of time! ;) Free bottled water, candy, tv to watch while you wait. I'm a fan!<//review>

<Resp>{'time': 1483549298968, 'text': 'Sorry to hear you are the first to feel that way. Did you ask for a price match?  You can do that even when you call asking about an ethernet cable.   You see, we advertise that we will always match or beat any competitors prices so that you can always get the best rate for repair or price on an item.   And even better though, our competitor is one of our fellow community members so we are happy you were able to give them business.  It all helps support local businesses.  Next time you need anything and you feel there is a better price, feel free to ask for a price match so you can get the best deal! We will be more than happy to help and match or beat any price for you! :)    Thank you for supporting small local Lake County businesses!'}</Resp><GmapID>0x8083e67512f89d5f:0xd79397cccc98561d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>My tall shaken espresso just tasted like sweetener, no coffee flavor whatsoever 🤷🏼‍♀️ I order a tall shaken espresso quite regularly at various Starbucks and don’t understand why this had zero espresso in it. I know everyone makes things differently but this shouldn’t be acceptable, especially when it’s ordered as is and has no customization.< /text>< Response>

Took thirty minutes after I got the "order ready" notification and twenty minutes after I checked in to the pick up spot for them to bring me the wrong (and much cheaper than what I paid for) drink. Super awful service at this location.< /review>

The drink was sitting on the counter for 10 minutes, but it was only accessible from an employee handling out the drinks. Other locations the name on the drink order is called out by the barista. Not this location. I will not go back to this Starbucks location.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I come here in the morning,  line isn't usually too bad but the turn around for getting your coffee is. The two girls that make the coffee always look like they hate their job, they whisper the customers names when their coffee is ready, and they dont properly read how the drink is supposed to be made. One time I had to come back because my drink tasted like water, the girl did remake it but after she made three other drinks... on the other hand the girl with the green hair that works here is always super nice, friendly, and assures she makes a good impression. She deserves recognition. Thank you for slightly making up for your coworkers bad customer service.</Text><Rating>3<//Rating>< resp>

2 stars simply because the coffee was good. The service was TERRIBLE. I was there at 12:30 on Labor Day. I couldn’t see the name of the employees but I was very disappointed in their service. I frequent other locations on a daily basis and have never had such bad service. There were three girls, one was cleaning and the other two who seemed on the young side had absolutely no urgency to get anything done in a timely manner. I placed a mobile order and waited close to 15 minutes for a cold brew which is already premade and a coffee Frappuccino that sat in the blender for five minutes before they finally got around to finishing it. There were two people sitting at the bar where they place finished drinks and they were clearly friends of the employees and they sat sprawled out on the bar making it impossible to get the drink without having to reach through them. They chatter with their friends while drink tickets piled up and drinks remained unfinished at the coffee stations. They didn’t make eye contact with me or acknowledge me at all and didn’t even call my name when my drinks were finally finished. Very disappointed in this experience and I will not be returning.</Review>

I like Starbucks even if they are a little pricey.  I prefer making my own expresso drinks. But if I'm out running around Starbucks is a good stop for coffee or snacks.</text>

Way to many kids after school, middle , jr,  high school kids.  I could barely walk through the sidewalk areas with kids, their bikes, just loitering. High school kids sitting on the jeep doors with loud rap music. I wasn't able to walk into the Starbucks , there must have been 50 kids I line and a lot of other kids waiting for drinks or at the seating areas.</Text>

<response>None<//response><Rate>3<//Rate><text>My normal location is the Los Gatos/Highway 85 one, but they're not taking mobile orders and so I chose this place. I get it that they're busy, but they messed up my drink. I always order by mobile and never once has a Starbucks messed up my order until now. They seem kinda scattered and confused here.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>It was Starbucks. They're all the same, except for in this case there was no soap in the mens room. When I told the wait staff, they looked at me blank-faced -- as if I was speaking a different language. I don't know if the soap was EVER refilled.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

The wonderful aromas from the wood fired meats is the first thing that you'll agree with, the second is the unpretentious manner of the restaurant.  I recommend entering through the back door (on the north side of the building) and slowly walking through the restaurant as to see first hand what the other diners are having, while on your way to the hostess stand.  We arrived at 11:45 on a Thursday and were seated within 5 minutes, those that arrived at 12:15 had a 30 minute wait, so plan ahead.
The smoked salmon appetizer is worth a two hour drive by itself and its smart to order two (take one home for later that night) the French dip sandwich is the best you'll ever have and is big enough for two, as is the ceasar salad with rock shrimp.
This was a 5 star visit only because 7 stars isn't an option.<//Text>

Food, service and atmosphere are always the best.  Seasonal grilled artichokes are a must this spring! We have dinner every time we are in the area and sometimes we detour through just so we can have dinner here.< /text>

Salmon- impeccable
BBQ- outstanding
Key lime pie- coma inducing, don’t pass up!

<Text>Bummer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!after smelling the  aroma from their restaurant for years we decided to give it a go for our 15th anniversary...they had us in and out in 40 min. No water was offered to us and our food was comparable to Applebee's but way more expensive. The Hawaiian ribeye was really off I can't even explain it only the pictures do it justice..after telling the manager that I have never seen a ribeye overdone and med rare and chewy at the same time she really didn't seem to care.
Maybe it was because we were the only brown shells in the white sand box????
All n all it felt like they wanted us in and out and took talent to royally mess up the ribeye the way this "grill" did .........I bet if they knew I was reviewing them that steak would have been freshly cooked!!!!!! Worst ribeye I have had in any establishment.....ps adding to have to ask for water.....it was clearly warm tap water! 🙄<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Food was delicious, drinks were on point, service was prompt and friendly. We've always been pleased with the restaurants in Napa, but this one definitely stood out. Overall a great value.

From a native Texan, the ribs and coleslaw were outstanding, and the chicken thigh sausage was quite tasty as well. The dark meat chicken was well seasoned and moist, but the white meat was lackluster and could've used brining.< /Text>< Pics>

We have eaten in 2 times, and take out 2 times. Two different trips, that were about 11 months apart and the food was consistently excellent every time. Actually thought about packing my leftover steak for the flight home ;).< /Text>

This place was sooo good! Atmosphere, service, menu. We ate inside, but the outdoor patio is cool too. The salads came out looking like art and tasting as good. Was able to order a vegan option (not many choices) but I got salad with a veggie burger patty to sub protein.< /review>

<Text>We ate there twice while in town. Had the Hawaiian, a ribeye with a slight pineapple glaze, delicious!...and a cheeseburger on our second visit, also yum! The wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.

The menu is somewhat limited but don't let thet dissuade your decision to eat here!<//Text>< rating>

I absolutely love this place. It was my birthday this time.The staff is kind, funny and just an absolute joy! Courtney was awesome and the guy that served us 1st.. (sorry I can't remember his name) he was fantastic! I will be back to bring my son here for his birthday in Aug. This was my second time being here.. the food never disappoints! If you want to go out to a place where you have quality food and amazing staff that treats you right.. Rutherford Grill is the place to go!< /Review>

The wine selection is pretty good and lots of options. Food was okay. Nothing really exceptional or 'wow'. Definitely the food is overpriced. My girlfriend got the BBQ Salmon. It was delightful, but besides that, all the other plates were pretty so so. My entree was the BBQ platter as you can see in the picture. The ribs was decent, but the chicken was extremely dry. Two other people in my table order a dish that contained a half chicken as well and both their chicken were also hard to eat. One of the plates were returned to the kitchen and a new dish was readily available, but I would still recommend other places around over this restaurant. We had 3 orders of fries. All of them were soggy, if you may. They remind me In and Out fries, but for 8 dollars each.< /Text><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

last night was the first time we visited this excellent restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last. We had great time with the courteous service, with the finest  dishes and fine drinks and with the comfortable payment. We will surely come back in a short time.< /text>

It was a nice place.  I gave my son a treat and he chose the place.  The experience was good the salad was great and the ambience is very welcoming and feels great.  I could always come back here and add it to my favorite to go to place. And BTW your prime rib fillet taste just right.<//text>

Amazing food, however they REALLY don't want to serve you food outdoors. Even in 2020 in October in the middle of the pandemic with no vaccines yet, they would not let you eat outside. It was as if they catered only to Covid deniers. It was so weird. While we just wanted to have a nice meal outdoors so we could be protected It wasn't permitted. Their food is excellent but we just can't go back again because they are still doing the same thing. Limited appetizers is the only food items outside.< /text>

Food was delicious, drinks were on point, service was prompt and friendly. We've always been pleased with the restaurants in Napa, but this one definitely stood out. Overall a great value.

From a native Texan, the ribs and coleslaw were outstanding, and the chicken thigh sausage was quite tasty as well. The dark meat chicken was well seasoned and moist, but the white meat was lackluster and could've used brining.< /Review>

<Text>Prejudice at Rutherford Grill...when Finally seated we placed our order. My friend requested a martini and was asked if she preferred gin or vodka.. When the food arrived I followed up on our drinks... No one check on us. I waived down help for BBQ sauce + drinks ( we were half way through the meal when the bbq sauce + soda arrived) Finally the waitress came over and said our table had been "cut- off".  When I asked why she said that I mentioned being drunk 😳 I went wine tasting but never used the word drunk plus I ordered soda. I asked for the manager. Ashley apologized and said that it was the "policy". Really? Now my friend is embarrassed, just wants to pay & leave. I was left with questions like,  why was this not mention to us earlier? Why was a drink order taken in the first place? As the only Hawaiian + Latina I felt singled out and discriminated against.  They needed the table and rushed us out. This tarnished our experience and I'm still Shocked. My first time out since having my son now 26 months old + made reservations 3 weeks in advance to be treated like this..<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>crispy salary in deviled eggs was delicious! Many ordered spinach and artichoke dips at the terrace. If there's a long line, have a dip at the terrace and someone will come and get you shortly. I ordered a pork tenderloin with black beans on rice. This dish was delectable. Juicy and moist.< /Review>< Pictures>

Good food. Nice atmosphere. Great service. Prices are fair to moderate depending on what you order. It was good enough for a repeat visit. First indoor dining since the pandemic which was nice as well. Recommend a visit. We had no complaints.<//text>

One of my favorite restaurants in the Napa Valley.  I always take my out-of-town guests here; an enjoyable Napa experience.  It is clean/spacious & located near Napa Valley's vineyards.

You must try their succulent slab of BBQ ribs or the rotisserie chicken.  It's fall-off-the-bone DELICIOUS! 👍<//review>

The place is nice, the waitress was super friendly and helpful to our big table (we were 8 people). The wine selection is pretty good and lots of options. Food was okay. Nothing really exceptional or 'wow'. Definitely the food is overpriced. My girlfriend got the BBQ Salmon. It was delightful, but besides that, all the other plates were pretty so so. My entree was the BBQ platter as you can see in the picture. The ribs was decent, but the chicken was extremely dry. Two other people in my table order a dish that contained a half chicken as well and both their chicken were also hard to eat. One of the plates were returned to the kitchen and a new dish was readily available, but I would still recommend other places around over this restaurant. We had 3 orders of fries. All of them were soggy, if you may. They remind me In and Out fries, but for 8 dollars each.</Text>

Had the pleasure of having dinner here during a trip to Napa. Great spot, nice menu, enjoyed my meal thoroughly, which was BBQ ribs, my friend had the prime rib which was delicious too. Of course the corn bread they start you off with is nice and hot and is and very tasty.<//text>

Food is scrumptious. We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer and to our pleasant surprise it is a hearty serving of salmon, spread and artisan toast. Needless to say we could have shared a salad or entree, to accompany the aforementioned appetizer, to be comfortably satisfied. However, hunger got the better of us, ordering the tri-trip and enchiladas plate which is not just nice to look at but delicious, whereas the hickory burger is lean and juicy.<//Review>

<review>Fully exceeded my expectations! I first visited this franchise in my native city (Los Angeles) the Pasadena & Santa Monica location; if you’re visiting add it to your to-DINE list 👍🏼

During my visit  | 6.29.19  | Parker helped us. She was supper knowledgeable and made our experience a memorable one! 👌🍷🍇
Honestly I’m not surprised, the service and food were truly excellent and exactly what I had expected when I made the reservation.
👌😍

My Top favs are: File Mignon, Hawaiian Ribeye Steak, and the BBQ Ribs (Lemon Drop 🍸🙌🏻)</review></record>

<Text>Absolutely fantastic! Everything from the food to the service was such a delight.

I came in and ate at the bar (best bet if you don’t have reservations). The service was on point. Never let my glass go empty.

For starters we ordered the spinach artichoke dip. It came with salsa and sour cream as well. Before we even finished the chips the waiter came with more chips to finish the appetizer.

For our main entree i ordered the Hawaiian steak and my boyfriend ordered the prime rib. Both medium rare and cooked to perfection. The prime rib was a great cut and very juicy. The Hawaiian was the perfect amount of sweet with the sides of mashed potatoes and vegetables to balance it out. Made the top of our list.

To end the meal we split a key lime pie. The pie was majestic. I’m not a big fan of key lime pie but i couldn’t stop eating it. It was full of flavor with every bite.

I would highly recommend this place to whenever you’re in the area. A must if i May say< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Amazing ambience and food!! We came for Valentines Day weekend and had phenomenal service from our server and the bartenders! The bartender, wish I could remember his name, assisted us when our server wasn't nearby and he was so kind and helpful! We had a delicious spinach and artichoke dip, I had the butternut squash enchiladas with an egg on top and my fiancée had the filet mignon. Everything was superb and we will defintely be back !!</Review>< Pics>

The Rutherford Grill a great place to go for American comfort food. They have large selection of all kinds of drinks and of course provide too much food, which I like. The rib eye special was delicious, although the steaks shape looked more like a step steak. The hickory burger was very tasty. However, I really didn't like them leaving the cheese freshly grated on the bun. This resulted in a cold layer in the burger which was tasty, but thick enough to stay cold and unmelted. I love cheese on a burger, but cook it please.< /review>

I would have to say that this is some of the best food I have ever had in my life. The attention to quality is above and beyond. I am personally obsessed with how they make lettuce taste so good with their oil based vinegratte!</text>

Food was delicious. Very attentive wait-staff. The restaurant had a friendly atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it is too noisy inside the restaurant.< /Review>

<Text>Great food and excellent service. If the artichokes are in season (which they were not unfortunately on this trip) the grilled artichoke is delicious and highly recommended.
The oreo ice cream sandwich is also very yummy.<//Text>< Pictures>

We arrived and they told us to wait outside, no one really offered us nothing so we weren't expecting much at that point. Then we got called inside and ordered ribs and salmon and i ordered a cornbread because i was craving it. We also got smoked artichokes as an starter. The food as absolutely amazing so unexpected the cornbread was soo good we actually ordered one to go. Overall food was way better than the service.<//Text>

I will give it an incomplete. To be honest this was not my first choice. There was a power outtage and this was a restaurant that had a back up generator. It was outside seating the the service was good. I had the French Dip sandwich and a cocktail. It was all delicious. However, the menu was limited because of the power outtage. Therefore, I could not give it a full review.  I would go back under normal circumstances just to try something off the regular menu.</review>

Good food but horrible how some staff treat newer staff.  Absolutely rude and uncalled for the way the two ladies that obviously had been there a while treated a new member of your crew.  The worst treatment I have ever witnessed.  Down right wrong.  Not a place I want to spend my money at again.  The cruelty the staff showed to the newer employee was not something they should be proud of.  I won't return to your establishment ever.</Text>

I've been dining at Rutherford Grill for years. I love this place. The service is awesome and the staff is so friendly. It's upscale casual and very comfortable. The first time I sat at the bar and had a martini, they do make an excellent martini. The bartender actually refreshed my martini for me with an ice-cold glass... excellent. Very attentive staff. I usually get the salmon, it's excellent. They do change the menu slightly, based on season and availability, but it's always good. Last weekend the salmon came with coconut rice. Wow, it was delicious and the salmon was perfectly cooked. It is sometimes a wait to get in, as they are always busy on the weekend, but grab a cocktail and sit out on the patio. The wait is worth it.< /Text>

They have an extensive listing of wines, or you can bring your own for a very low Cork fee....free!  I can't think of anything that went wrong during our visit.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Good food but horrible how some staff treat newer staff.  Absolutely rude and uncalled for the way the two ladies that obviously had been there a while treated a new member of your crew.  The worst treatment I have ever witnessed.  Down right wrong.  Not a place I want to spend my money at again.  The cruelty the staff showed to the newer employee was not something they should be proud of.  I won't return to your establishment ever.<//Text>< Rating>

We love the Rutherford Grill, have been going for more years than I can remember. The food is delicious, and the service is always great. And, the location can't be beat. Enjoy some wine tasting while you are in the area.</review>

Update: Third time here and it was wonderful once again!!! I’m adding new pics be prepared for mouthwatering experience!!!

This is only my second time here. And both time we had to a wait time of at least one hour. If you’re out at the wineries and decide you want to eat here make sure to make reservations. So we decided to sit at the bar and indulge in their appetizers and drinks instead. The appetizers were amazing and desserts were a delight!

We ordered jalapeño corn bread, spinach and artichoke dip with chips,  home smoked Salmon and deviled eggs. The jalapeño corn bread was serve on a circular pan that had crunchiness around it but moist inside. The jalapeño was not over power which made the bread unique, not to mention it was made from scratch....The smoked salmon was a delight, it came with this dill sauce instead of tartar sauce of some kind. That sauce actually compliments the salmon very well.

For desserts we went with apple walnut cobbler with vanilla ice cream, which came in warm and toasty and a spoonful of ice cream to the bite was so delightful! The open faced Oreo ice cream was served as an ice cream sandwich in a bed of warm chocolate sauce, the servings were big enough to share unless you just love dessert then get your own :D.

Last but not least they had an amazing list of wine. If you like red blends, I recommend the scouts honor red blends. It has a mixed of Zinfandel, Charbono, petite Sirah, and Syrah!!! At first sip you will find it amazing on the palate throughout with a smooth finish!< /Text>

This restaurant is consistently good as was this visit. We didn't have to wear masks; the waitresses were wearing masks. The menu is shortened😒🥺 which we didn't expect... There wasn't really much to choose from 😔<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Great place for lunch when wine tasting in Napa valley. Easily accessible from Silverado Hwy and right on Hwy 24. Really delicious California cuisine. Everything we had was delicious. For out of the box try the Squash enchilada  topped with an egg served with a nice slice of ribeye and a fresh cucumber salad. Also the French Dip is amazing and the cornbread superb and wedge salad solid . Free corkage on one bottle of wine!< /Text><Response>None</Response><user_name>J Jestice (J-Reddish)< /user_name>< Date>

If you need a more "large restaurant" feel in a very chill and romantic setting, this is your place in wine country. It's a sister restaurant to the Los Altos Grill in South Bay. Great drinks, music, and service!< /text>

A must stop when visiting Napa. Start with any of their delicious appetizers, then order the jalapeno cornbread, baked in a cast iron skillet and served at your table hot. They're wild rice side dish is amazing and has least 20 ingredients. All their meat is slow-cooked , very tasty and tender. Prices are good. I have been visiting Napa for 10 years and stop there every year when I visit.<//Review>

I had a nice day in Napa wine tasting with my boyfriend.  Had lunch here and ordered the pork chop.  To my surprise the waitress brought rare pork chops to me and says this is the way it’s prepared...NOT.  I am not eating raw pork, disgusting.   She had the chef cook it but it still came back raw.  I won’t be coming back here again.<//Text>

<text>Their French Dip is to die for. Prime rib cooked to perfection on their house made roll. Served with Fries or mashed potatoes, au ju sauce, and horseradish. Excellent and tentative service, even during these times. They have perfected social distancing dining. I will definitely be back!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Date>1575446298248< /Date><review>The good:

-Deviled eggs -   These were very tasty
- Grilled artichokes- They are only seasonal, and they are very good.
- Tri-tip and enchilada - This was absolutely delicious!  If service improved, I'd definitely come back just for this entree.
- The Hawaiian - This was different tasting, but, still delicious.

The bad:

Service was terrible.  We were shoved at the end of the restaurant (there were plenty of empty tables, AND we had a reservation).  The waitress hardly came to check on us and we had to flag whoever passed by for the obvious, such as forks, small plates for our appetizers, etc...

There are too many dining options in Napa for us to come back.</review></record></dataset><record>

Excellent experience. Great ambiance, food & wine! This place gets super busy since there isn't much around, specially open late, by late I mean 7:45pm, so prepare to wait unless you make a timely reservation.< /text>

Rutherford Hill does not disappoint. In an area of very high dollar restaurants, this location is beautiful and the food is also delicious. We sat outside with wine while we waited for a table and watched the Napa Valley Wine Train go by.<//Text>

<review>I had a nice day in Napa wine tasting with my boyfriend.  Had lunch here and ordered the pork chop.  To my surprise the waitress brought rare pork chops to me and says this is the way it’s prepared...NOT.  I am not eating raw pork, disgusting.   She had the chef cook it but it still came back raw.  I won’t be coming back here again.< /review><Time>1586578047305< /Time><user_id>104963735910296700529<//user_id>< pics>

I love Rutherford Grill! We have been coming here for over 20 years. Ambiance is dark and warm with excellent spot lighting. Service is efficient and friendly. The food is delicious.....our favorite is the house smoked salmon for the appetizer and anything grilled or BBQ'd.</Review>

Very nice restuarant in napa. We went there for my aunts b day. The meal with drinks for 5 people was about 269. Not bad for the amount and quality of food we got. The one thing we did not like was during the middle of the day we sat near a window and they shut the blinds making it. Almost  pitch black. We wanted to sit by the window to see the scenery.  They should hold off on doing that until later in the day.<//review>

<Text>Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  Love their french dip sandwich.  Parking leaves a little to be desired since it seems like it shares space with the winery next door, but definently a great place to dine.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The food was delicious. The service was great. Definitely make sure you have a reservation ahead of time. Plenty of parking and a nice menu selection. Will visit again when we are back in the area.<//Review>

I love Rutherford Grill! We have been coming here for over 20 years. Ambiance is dark and warm with excellent spot lighting. Service is efficient and friendly. The food is delicious.....our favorite is the house smoked salmon for the appetizer and anything grilled or BBQ'd.<//review>

<review>Very nice restuarant in napa. We went there for my aunts b day. The meal with drinks for 5 people was about 269. Not bad for the amount and quality of food we got. The one thing we did not like was during the middle of the day we sat near a window and they shut the blinds making it. Almost  pitch black. We wanted to sit by the window to see the scenery.  They should hold off on doing that until later in the day.< /review>< Time>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Not taking California and CDC covid restrictions seriously. Restaurant was packed. Bar area was packed. Won't let you order from full menu and eat outside. Only appetizers outside. Asked to order to go and eat outside and still said no. "We ask that you leave the premises if you order go". But it ok to stay on premises outside if you order appetizers?!? Makes zero sense. They had restaurant packed at bar, tables and booths. Little to no spacing. Made me not trust what was happening in the kitchen. We left and went to Gary's down the road.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Great restaurant.  Service was spot on.  Food was off the chain. Salmon was excellent, salad as well. Dessert....keylime....to die for.
I'm coming here again when I'm up this way.
Actually, they were better than 5 stars.
Personell were top quality and right there in service.
Give everyone a high five!</text>

Terrible signage! GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE!! If you are looking for this place, look for Beulieu Vineyards Tasting Room because it's the same parking lot. There wasn't even signage on the door! When I arrived and asked the very elegant and lovely hostess if this was Rutherford Grill she said, "Yes!" like I should have known. I told her there are "NO SIGNS!" She politely showed me a very large, low to the ground, darkly painted sign near the road. We NEVER SAW IT!

The FOOD WAS FANTASTIC! OUR SERVER, TAYLOR, WAS GREAT.

Worth going to...if you have the patience to find it:)< /Review>

<review>Really great! BBQ platter was delicious! Kelly is a fabulous waitress. Kelly deserves 5 stars food deserves 5 stars.You need a little help in the cocktail section. No specials for drinks, or great ideas for one. Took 25 mins for the outside cocktail waitress to come to me. She served 3 tables that arrived after me I had to wave her down.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Food was good especially the grilled artichoke but the service was a little slow. Also a bit pricey for the amount of food you get. Definitely a tourist destination, would be nice if they did something for locals to make it more affordable. For a party of 4 we each paid more then $40 and that didn't include wine.</review>< time>

Unless I want seafood, this restaurant is my favorite. PERIOD. I drove over an hour to get here with friends for lunch. That much favorite! The corned bread is so famous, when you Google "Rutherford Grill", the corned bread is the second thing to come up. That's how much people love it and it's not even on the menu! I used to order all different items off their menus but now I only get the pork ribs. You don't even need a knife. The meat just falls off the bone. And the bbq sauce is not overwhelming - it's just right. Service is always perfect too. If I had to think hard about something negative, it could be certain sitting areas are louder than others, but all acceptable. Wish they used Open Table for reservations too.  Happy eating!< /Text>

Recommend making a reservation as this place gets real busy. And for good reason. The spinach artichoke dip is a must as is the corn bread. If you love steak, the Hawaiian ribeye cannot be beat. The ribs are some of the best I've found outside Kansas City. Hurry on in.. you won't be disappointed</review>

Stopped here for dinner. We had French Dip sandwiches, Kale and Roasted Chicken salad. All were good. Service was a bit spotty, might be due to having a new server.  I will return and recommend this restaurant.< /text>

<Review>Extremely changed from even couple years ago. It's too bad due to the fact that this was a place too go with family for a great dinner. Very small portions, BBQ ribs not even close to before. Sent back filet mignon and stop they didn't get it right, medium should not be that hard to cook. This is time for artichokes, yet none. Very dissatisfied today.</Review>< pics>

My favorite place ro eat in Napa! Went there twice in a 4 day span because I loved it. Great menu...good food! Had the french dip and grilled chicken salad. While the grilled chicken salad sounds plain, it is far from it! Lots of good stuff!<//text>

Good place but we waited a fair amount of time past our reservation time.  We arrived early and were told they would seat us closer to our reservation time.  It would have been a better experience if we were told they were running a little late.  We would have relaxed at their outdoor bar had we known 5 mins was going to be closer to 30.<//Text>

<Review>Solid American menu. First class service. We each had Caesar salad with fried shrimp and rotissiere chicken. Both were good. The fried shrimp was great!  Enjoy.< /Review>< Time>

<date>1523756090002<//date><rating>2<//rating><Review>I've been to Rutherford Grill a couple of times  in the past.  We were quite disappointed with  the visit. Service was poor.  We ordered cocktails, appetizer, salad and dinner.

The drinks arrived, quickly followed by salmon appetizer.  Then our salad arrived and immediately our main course.  When we said something to our server, she replied this is how we do it here....

Since we have been here before, we knew that wasn't the case.  We rushed through our salad to dinner. It was all VERY rushed and unfriendly.

With so many other dining options in the area, I know we won't be back.  With it being my daughter in laws birthday, it was additionally hugely disappointing.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Our first restaurant to try out in Rutherford and we were very happy with it. I got the salmon dish with mashed potatoes and a lemon drop with raspberry cocktail drink. It was perfect! We will definitely be back the next time we come to visit.< /review>

<text>The menu is stale but everything is seasoned and cooked well.  The wine was great.  I just think that the menu could use some creativity and 2018 updates.  The service was good but not great.  For these reasons, I cannot give 5 stars.<//text>< response>

It can get loud and can have a LONG wait if you don't have a reservation.  The iron skillet cornbread is to die for, baked to perfection with a moist center and well balance crust.  We love the ribs, burger and french dip sandwich.  Actually, we have never had anything but fabulous food from here.  Their test kitchen is in Yountville - R&D Kitchen.  It too is outstanding and helps develop food for all of the Hills restaurants.  Super YUMMY.  Highly recommend it, with reservations.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We stopped here for lunch. We only got burgers n the chicken sandwiches! Loved my burger, not big on the fries...needed seasoning everyone enjoyed the food n the service. I got broccoli with parmesan and i liked it alot in place of fries BUT they sent the fries or anyway. Really liked the broccoli. I would recommend this place n loved the service. We heard it was owned by Houston's....the smells were GREAT!!<//review>

The French dip was absolutely amazing. It has the smoothest texture I've ever had in a French dip sandwich. Also, the artichokes were meaty with a perfect grilled flavor that I can't seem to accomplish back at home. The wait is worth if you happen to be in wine country.<//Text>

<Text>Had the crispy chicken sandwich. Chicken was cooked to perfection. Coleslaw added to the crunch of the chicken and added an element of fresh zest to the taste. Extremely balanced and palatable choice.<//Text><GmapID>0x80845698b7c6cf11:0x745f1bcf2fee460d<//GmapID><time>1543644776146< /time></record></dataset><record>

I love the grill. I don't think anyone leaves hungry. Last I heard,   no corkage and very fair wine prices.
They don't take reservations and they do get busy. I haven't had a problem but I know it can get busy. I just don't go at peek times or I get it to go. The wait will be long. You can sit at the bar or outside with a drink while you wait. The younger hostess is the sweetest hostess ever.  I'm always so impressed by her.</Text>

This used to be my favorite place. In all of Napa Valley.  I travel about 75% of the time for work and I am a foodie fiend.  Rutherford Grill is always my top recommendation for anyone traveling through the area. The artichokes. The prime rib sandwich.  And most extraordinary of all... the prime rib! So,  why they took it off the menu, is beyond me?  I was so disappointed when I arrived there last week; mouthwatering—drool running down my face—just waiting for that first bite of their delicious prime rib. I even brought a friend with me, promising the best prime rib he had ever eaten. I don’t even know how to describe the let-down I felt when the waitress told us they were no longer serving prime rib. I still enjoyed the prime rib sandwich and the worlds best artichokes, but I feel inclined to only give this place a two star recommendation now simply due to my overwhelming disappointment. If they bring the prime rib back, I’ll bump it back up to five stars, but in the meantime, I don’t think Rutherford Grill will be first on my list when I make my monthly trip through Napa. Shame on the person(s) who made the decision to remove this from the menu. 😡</Text>

Food was delicious. Medium / small portions for a pretty high price. Bacon on the burger was floppy instead of crisp. Usually the default is crisp so.. Be warned if you don't want floppy bacon.< /Review>

We have not been here or the Los Altos grill in a while (same owners) - food was not as good as I remembered. Not bad, just not great. Service was good, but my hamburger was way overcooked, and I was not offered any comp for that. Would have been nice if they did not charge our corkage fee. Probably would not go back there again.< /Text>

<Review>Arrived on a Thursday for a late lunch as a group of us were heading further north. Had a small understandable wait because there were ten of us. Once inside, we had great service. The group couldn't stop talking about how good everything was from the appetizers to the main lunch. I had the cheese burger and it was good as well. If I'm ever back in this part of California, I will come back.<//Review>< pictures>

Black bean burger with no bun or a salad are your only choices.
The black bean burger has odd Asian spices. Would have been good five years ago, but doesn't meet current expectations.<//Text>< Name>

We stopped here after a couple of wine tastings.  The grilled artichokes were excellent.  We had never eaten them and fell in love with them.  The service was friendly and swift.  A great place to eat.< /text>

Ribs, french dip, salmon, focaccia, cornbread, mashed potatoes - get them all when you go and it’ll be the best meal you’ll have in Napa. Locals love it!</Review>

<Review>The food was delicious but it was so hot in there that my mom ended up vomiting her expensive meal. We complained several times and were assured they had turned it down, but it never got cooler and no attempt was made to move us to a cooler part of the restaurant. We are from Texas and are used to the heat, and that was not a fun dining experience.</Review>< user_name>

Went for lunch and we were seated right away since we had a reservation. We did wait a long time to order our food but when we got our food it was very hot and delicious! I ordered their pork ribs and it was very tender and falling off the bone! Super yummy! Highly recommend making a reservation.</Text>

Rutherford Grill is a gem in Napa Valley.  The food and service were exceptional.   It is a bit pricey but I felt that it was reasonable given the quality if the restaurant.  I had the Ahi salad..  The Ahi was scrumptious.  We ordered the corn bread as a side.  That was some of the best cornbread I've ever had. Not good for calorie counters as it was full of butter. Service was impeccable</review>

My favorite place of all time. The Prime Rib and mashed potatoes are un-beatable. Plus the Oreo cookie dessert? TOO good. I wish I could eat every meal here. Will go back any chance I get. Do not hesitate, go.</review>

The ribs are AMAZING. I would definitely  recommend the spinach and artichoke dip as a precursor to your main course... don't get side tracked the reason you are here is because of the RIBS period... unless you are planning on ordering takout, which I would then recommend getting their whole rotisserie chicken ... it will put a whole foods rotisserie chicken to shame.<//Text>

Nice place. Part of the chain that brought you Houston's. It's a solid choice with good things on the menu. Straight down the line  it's a quality place that staffers keep lively and clean. No mistakes coming here.</text>

They didnt want to take a "to go" order over the phone. "We dont do those on weekends" interesting, why not? Is it easier for you? or more customer friendly? Went to the restaurant and grabbed a seat at the bar, ordered, took 15 mins to get order. Which is about the same amount of time if they would have taken the order over the phone in the 1st place. Besides I took up a seat at the bar while I waited. The business should make those decision based on what's best for the guests.</Review>

It's best in the summertime when they open the outside bar. Prices range from moderate to very pricey. It's worth the money you spend.< /Text>

Start with the cornbread! Our group saw it at another table and just had to have it and I know some in our group didn't get to have any because it was gone so fast. The ribs fall right off the bone and are very tasty, I highly recommend. One thing I wasn't keen on were the deviled eggs - I thought the celery chunks were too big and I'm not a fan of crunch in my deviled eggs, but if you are, go ahead and order them. The service was nice and friendly, but watch out the rib plates can get messy.</text>

Also, I don't understand why it's perpetually dark. it could be the most beautiful day ever in Napa Valley, and you walk into that place and it's so unbelievably dark you can hardly see the hand in front of your face. So, while you sit in the dark it smells very good and you just try the best to look at the menu and not pass out when you see all the prices. On a nice day, you should consider going someplace where you can look out the windows or even sit outside like R&D kitchen.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

<review>A classic. Amazing service always. No corkage on your first bottle! Bring a nice red and get the ribs! Kale salad and all the veggie sides are also our favorites, plus the artichoke if it's in season.

This place is romantic, casual enough yet classic... We are local and we adore Rutherford, we bring Gramps and he gets a MaiTai and eats ribs to his hearts desire. Have never had a bad experience in 10+ years of coming to Rutherford Grill.🔥< /review></record></dataset><record>

Always a great place to eat when in the Napa area. Great location in the valley. The selection in the menu is broad enough that you are bound to find something. The wine selection is fantastic showcasing local, but with some wines from other regions to offer you a break from the local.< /review>

<Text>wait was pretty long. but a good beer from the outside bar made the wait much easier. Bread and butter was to die for. Very good quality food and plenty of options. Great stop to eat during your wine tasting trip in Napa. Can't wait to go back.<//Text>< Name>

Positively love this restaurant for years and years to come. If you like your meat cooked to Perfection and a sampling of some good food in a great town stop by and check out the prime rib the roast beef the ribeye.
Heck a little bit of everything. I promise you can't go wrong if you been in Napa getting wine bring it by and enjoy it with your delicious meal.<//Review>

Very pleased with our experience.  We made reservations and got right in on a busy Saturday evening.  They have no corkage fees, so we enjoyed bringing our own bottle that we picked up from wine tasting in the area.  My wife and I split the ribs and chicken salad which were both delicious.  Servers were very friendly and attentive.< /text>

Very decent food at reasonable prices.  Ordered the dishes recommended by others:  grilled artichokes, kale salad, and BBQ ribs, and enjoyed everything.  We asked the winery we visited before coming here to pair a bottle for our dinner, and we enjoyed it very much (happy about the price/no corkage and the food/wine combo)</Text>

Called in to try and get a reservation, was told over the phone that they do not do reservations. Decided to go in and see if we had a chance to get a seat. Walked in and they immediately asked if we had a reservation. Wait one second... We were told over the phone they don't do reservations yet when we walked in they asked if we had a reservation. They would not sit 5 people outside but they put a family of 6 outside at a table. Once again I don't understand why. Waiter seemed distant and would throw the food on our table. I would suggest not eating here. Poor service and management.<//Text>

<text>This is my favorite restaurant. It is frequently crowded, but if you know when to go there is always a space at the bar. The servers are great here. I always bring my own wine and share with the server. There is no corkage fee if you do this. My secret lunch is salmon, salad and rosemary focaccia....not too expensive and very filling.< /text>< Name>

There was a lot of talk in Rutherford about this place. Its actually not that good. Decent ribs and burgers but nothing to write home about. There are enough good restaurants out there that I wouldn't need to go here again.<//text>

Pretty good, but very expensive.  I got the chicken and ribs and they were of high quality.  Be sure you get the Oreo ice cream dessert; that was very good as well.</Review>

Wonderful atmosphere and decor. Definitely feels high-end without being stuffy. Good service and good food. We ordered the salmon and filet mignon, but we found the best part of our meal to be the whipped potato and Parmigiano reggiano topped broccolini!< /review>

This place is truly ICONIC in the Napa Valley! The food is perfect in every respect, the service is excellent almost EVERY visit (I've been there a lot, and everyone has a hiccup every now and then). I'm glad I live here and can visit often, but if you don't live here, itsa definite must-experience!</Text>

Positively love this restaurant for years and years to come. If you like your meat cooked to Perfection and a sampling of some good food in a great town stop by and check out the prime rib the roast beef the ribeye.
Heck a little bit of everything. I promise you can't go wrong if you been in Napa getting wine bring it by and enjoy it with your delicious meal.<//review>

This was a delicious lunch. Fabulous service. They are usually very busy but worth the wait. The cheeseburger was made at the degree requested and the children's rotisserie chicken was delicious.  A must have for the young'uns. The French Dip is delicious.  We ordered it with the coleslaw which was a perfect complement atop the sandwich (that's of course only if you like coleslaw).   I would recommend this restaurant to a friend.  (It was actually recommended to us!)< /text>

By far THE BEST ribs I've ever had. Fall off the bone, incredible bbq sauce. I'm a smaller woman with a small appetite, but I could eat several racks of these. Incredible. And those fries are a delicious companion. Great atmosphere. Classy but relaxed. Highly recommend.< /Review>

<review>I can't say enough about the food here. We had cornbread, smoked salmon, cucumber salad, ribs and deviled eggs. Everything was delicious ....I'm already ready to go back. We ate at the bar and that didn't take away from the experience.</review>< pics>

<review>Yep...the ribs...been coming for years, I've tried the other options there but its the ribs...eveytime! with the coleslaw, absolutely! and mashed potatoes...can't get enough...cornbread, gotta have it! And I know it, at one time they had bread pudding, but the staff doesn't remember serving it...it was a long time ago and it was awesome... Wish they bring it back...The staff along with the atmosphere is awesome... Love how the specials are always Bass or the half chicken half ribs...i will continue to recommend and visit this restaurant for years...< /review>< Pictures>

<time>1559080852656<//time><rate>5</rate><text>This place never disappoints! Although it is generally packed, the host staff make every effort to expedite seating. Had the Ahi Tuna and Mango salad and it was off the charts, the ahi superbly prepared (seared rare) and salad items all fresh and in optimal consistency. Dressing and accompaniments (wasabi, & ginger) made the salad perfect. Split the cornbread baked in a skillet with my companion and that was unbelievably awesome in flavor, texture and so rich, no butter was needed. Even though you're in wine country, the cocktails are as good as any celebrated bay area cocktail bar. You can't go wrong here.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Another overrated overpriced restaurant. I just don’t get the attraction. Ordered Bangers and mash for $17… I know this is basically English or Irish peasant food but they could’ve done a bit more rather than serving two mediocre sausages small spoonful of potatoes and red cabbage.

Also my guest ordered a ribeye steak… It was covered with sauce and I am sure it was not a ribeye steak. I questioned it and the waiter just reinforced the fact that it was a ribeye steak. If it was a ribeye steak… The quality was very poor.

You would think I would’ve learned by now not to order a steak in a restaurant unless they advertised it as prime or better.… And aged.</text>< Pictures>

This is our go-to place whenever we're in Napa. The barbecue ribs are to die for. We usually split the ribs along with the blue cheese salad wedge along with a couple glasses of Frog's Leap Zinfandel. But you won't like it :-)<//Review>

Always great food and excellent service. Try the ribs, rotisserie chicken, or try-tip enchilada. The cornbread is a must. Oh, and not corkage fee is a plus.< /review>

The food is good but it seems like a chore to get out here. Too much traffic and then after i made a reservation i still had to wait. The lady gave me some lame excuse of why i had to wait when there were 4 tables available. No internet access here. The restaurant is so loud! Very uncomfortable environment.</Review>

I was disappointed in the change in the menu at Rutherford's today.  My Sisters from church were also. We were looking for their famous mash potatoes with cabbage in it. The rest of the was okay. We won't be back until the potatoes are back.</Text>

Went here when my party was starving after a Wine Tour/Tasting and we shared some Dip and Chips while I had the Rotisserie Chicken which was nicely juicy and tasty along with the mash potatoes as they were spiced up quite well.
One negative would be it was quite pricey for what I ordered.< /text>

Nice place, albeit a bit pricy. (It is Napa Valley, after all). Beware if you're coming without a reservation - it took nearly two hours to be seated without one. The outside waiting area is very nice and there is an outdoor bar that operates during the summer. Service is very good, wonderful staff both at the bar and tableside. Ambiance inside can be a bit dark and noisy - you may have to raise your voice to be heard amongst your party.

Pro Tip: There's no corkage fee here so you can bring your own wine (maybe that you've purchased from one of your winery visits!) and they'll open it for you.</Text>

The Rutherford Grill was everything it's cracked up to be. I had a combination plate with perfectly cooked tri-tip and a very inventive squash enchilada with an excellent cumin infused red chili sauce. Wife had a bbq combo with tender smoky ribs and a plump chicken quarter, and the sides were as good as the main dishes. All the servers were in black slacks and crisp white shirts and blouses and the service was excellent. Cool jazz played in the background. A little pricey (but not for Napa), and a thoroughly delightful experience.<//review>

<text>Went here when my party was starving after a Wine Tour/Tasting and we shared some Dip and Chips while I had the Rotisserie Chicken which was nicely juicy and tasty along with the mash potatoes as they were spiced up quite well.
One negative would be it was quite pricey for what I ordered.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Food and Beverage  was good but glass of wine didn't arrive until after meal service. Management comp'd the glass. Elle the waitress must have had a bad night. Poured a glass of water while leaning over the table and the water condensation dripped into my bowl of sauce (sauce on the side). Great location but bad day for unhappy Elle<//review></record></dataset><record>

My family 's  favorite restaurant to go to.  Very busy though and the atmosphere is loud but the food is amazing and the service is right up there.  The Filet, ribs, prime rib,  broccoli,  sashimi tuna salad,  kale salad with chicken or rock shrimp,  artichoke,  smoked salmon appetizer, key lime pie,  banana cream pie, Oreo cookie dessert...are all MUST HAVES!<//text>

Way over priced.!! The food , I the ribs, my wife the chicken, did taste good. But for me the pathetic amount of meat on my ribs were laughable.  The only meat my ribs had were between the bones. I basically paid $28 for bone smothered in bbq, skinny fries and a spoonful of coleslaw.  Chicken was good, but again, for $24, you expect more than a little chicken and skinny fries.  Great atmosphere and area though, which is what you are paying for i guess.</Text>

I have yet to have a bad meal at Rutherford Grill.  The ribs and chicken are probably the best in the Valley.  Don't forget to try the corn bread and/or the artichokes!   (=< /Text>

<user_id>112875600879317812522< /user_id><Review>Don't go there if you have you have a disability, especially if you have a service dog.  They may be friendly to other dogs, but not to service dogs.  I waited 20 minutes with my large service dog while 2 dozen other people were seated with parties anywhere from 2 to 8 people.  When I questioned this practice the answer was that they could not seat me in a large booth meant for up to 8 people but they could seat a party of 4 there.  I was offered a table outside but in the sun only.  Pet dogs and their owners were offered shaded tables.  When I finally was seated, by the kitchen, I ordered the rotisserie chicken with french fries.  The waitress that tossed it at me (not my assigned server) could not look at me, maybe because the chicken was lukewarm or because she brought mashed potatoes instead of the french fries I had ordered.  No repeat visits from me and my service dog .</Review>< pics>

Not enough light indoors for my taste, but they have friendly service and were able to seat us pretty quickly. The rotisserie chicken was really good, as was the French dip.< /text>

Nice cocktails, steak was coated in some rub, which wasn't specified in the menu and not cooked as requested. Otherwise a nice place, still feels like a chain restaurant since Houston's owns this.< /Text>

Does not take reservations however where you want to eat is at the Horseshoe Bar. In the afternoon you find winemakers and Winery owners having lunch drinking their wine.</Text>

Not enough light indoors for my taste, but they have friendly service and were able to seat us pretty quickly. The rotisserie chicken was really good, as was the French dip.</review>

< Review>
We stayed at Rancho Caymus Inn and RG couldn't have been any more convenient of a place to grab a dinner after a day of travel.  This place is a great for what it is.  Just check the menu before you go so you know what to expect.  I definitely thought I was going into a steak house (envisioning "Capital Grill") so was a bit surprised when I ask the waiter the best thing on the menu he tells me it's between the enchiladas and French dip. That being said, the food was fine, the prices were Napa reasonable, and we enjoyed it.< /Review>

Ok. The bleu cheese wedge salad came with 1000 Island!? And it's not stated on the menu. BBQ combo plate wasn't as hefty as wait person implied.</Text>

Don't go there if you have you have a disability, especially if you have a service dog.  They may be friendly to other dogs, but not to service dogs.  I waited 20 minutes with my large service dog while 2 dozen other people were seated with parties anywhere from 2 to 8 people.  When I questioned this practice the answer was that they could not seat me in a large booth meant for up to 8 people but they could seat a party of 4 there.  I was offered a table outside but in the sun only.  Pet dogs and their owners were offered shaded tables.  When I finally was seated, by the kitchen, I ordered the rotisserie chicken with french fries.  The waitress that tossed it at me (not my assigned server) could not look at me, maybe because the chicken was lukewarm or because she brought mashed potatoes instead of the french fries I had ordered.  No repeat visits from me and my service dog .< /review>

Always full of locals and Napa Valley movers and shakers - for good reason. The food never fails to make me happy.  The service is flawless and friendly, but not fawning.

Often a wait, but worth it.  One can get a quickish lunch at the bar and overhear what is really going on in the Napa Valley.

Just go.</review>

The food tastes great. Even though we had to wait kind of long for our food, it was worth it because they came in large portions. Prices were expensive but it's a great place to eat if you want to experience what the area has to offer.</Review>

<review>We had a reservation for 6:45 for a table of 4. When we arrived at 6:45 they told us it would actually be more like 7:15. We ended up waiting 30 minutes for our reservation. Once we finally got our table, our plates for our appetizers were dirty. Not one of them, all of them. For such a well established restaurant,  these seem like amateur errors. Our entrees at least were good. Given the plethora of other options in the area, we'll probably pick another in the future.<//review>< name>

<Review>First of let me say we have been customers there since I think 94/95, maybe a little later but a long time OK. Every year for our anniversary we go. Always enjoyed going, but waited longer and longer to be seated as business picked up. Never complained, but always said to them when we left our name at the door, we wished they'd take reservations. But they never did, felt first come was better.
Tonight we show up for our annual dinner and we're asked by the uppity little snot at the door "if we have reservation?" We were both shocked to hear this and I ask since when did they take reservations? "Oh it's been for at least 9 years and sometimes we allow walk ins, but I'm full and not taking any. So now I am pissed. Knowing full well she was lying to me about reservations, I left while my wife stayed and talked to her. I could handle new policy, but don't lie to my face when I know this was not the fact. I'm not some tourist that wouldn't know any better. Reservations have always been a sore spot with me there, but since my wife loved the place so much, I did the wait, never once did I feel like I did tonight after being lied to.
Well guess what, went to "Angele's" instead, since they figured out how to work us in after hearing what went on with Rutherford Grill. My new go to place. Sorry Rutherford, but I'm done. I refuse to be lied to. Girl should be fired, PERIOD!

PS: I have a fifty dollar gift card if someone wants to buy it.<//Review><userid>100057730150852705260</userid>< Pictures>

Cosy place with great food but a bit overcrowded and noisy for my taste.
I felt pushed to order like if I had to "order, eat and go" in order to give my place to another customer...
I recommend it anyhow and hope to go back... in a calmer day!< /review>

We have been coming here for years. Now we live in Oregon, but, OH HOW WE LOVE IT!  The ribs and grilled artichokes are my favs.  I literally moan while eating them. Lol.  Dont stare if you hear me. :)  The Wait can be long, so come early.  Our waitress from Germany was wonderful. I can't recommend this place enough.</review>

Very consistent Food, service and atmosphere.  I get the French dip and Cole slaw. My wife gets the fish sandwich and salad.  The ribs are the best in the Napa Valley as well.

Right on the highway and easy to find.  The outside
Area of s really nice for a drink.

Make reservations in advance thru them.

<Review>This is such a comforting and inviting establishment, and the service was fantastic. The food...I can honestly say that I'll be dreaming of the French Dip sandwich for many nights ahead. The au jus is to die for, and if you must take away part of the sandwich (because you had to try three different appetizers to start....ahem), they'll be sure to include a container of au jus as well. The appetizers were amazing - try the cornbread. I've never had cornbread like this. I'm just sad I had no room for dessert, because I would have loved to try the Oreo cookie sandwich. Next time, because I will be back!<//Review><Name>Melissa Lavoie<//Name>< pics>

We were at the Beaulieu tasting room, which happened to be next door, when we discovered this lovely restaurant. We walked over, and put our name on the list - about a 75 minute wait. Since they have FREE bottle service, we had brought a bottle with us from Beaulieu and in total spent about 2 hours sitting at the bar with our wine. To be honest, I think they forgot us, but when we finally went up to ask, they had us seated at a table within 5 minutes.
The food was quite enjoyable. We had the ribs and the enchilada/tri-tip plate. We shared the oreo ice cream sandwich for dessert, and that was really good too. We'll be coming back here for sure - although hopefully next time we won't be waiting for 2 hours!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

My husband and I  each ordered  overpriced burgers. The patties where thin and tasteless.   The fries were typical shoe string fries, nothing special. I was disappointed.< /review>

<Review>It was a pleasant experience as usual...we always look forward to the best margartitas, vegi burgers and prime rib french dip - our fave stop in Napa. Tonight was busy - 2 hr wait for a table so we ordered our food to-go. Ordered our drinks at the bar...then a table on the patio opened up so we sat and enjoyed our $30 drinks...we ordered a few apps then our dinner (take out) was ready and we ate it at out table. No big deal...$30 for 2 drinks, $20 in apps, and $36 (not including tip) and guess what we were told that we had to leave by the manager. What a joke! Did I mention that they were no longer serving dinner on the patio! Long story short - we ordered drinks at the bar, ordered apps at the table and food to-go and we were told to leave because we were eating our dinner out of take out containers. Rutherford Grill - you truly have the WORST MANAGEMENT SKILLS EVER. Your staff is amazing however your management made us feel terrible for dining at your establishment. Sad that we spend a pretty penny to feel like 3rd class citizens - we will never recommend your establishment or be back...saddest thing is that it was the management not the staff... in my experience it's the management cleaning up the staffs mess; not in this case. Shame on you MANAGER!.<//Review></record>

They don’t really care about customers who made efforts to make a reservation. We made a reservation at 8pm, but had to wait for a table about 25 min. It was very unpleasant to watch a hostess dancing while customers were told to wait. Other than that, everything is great.<//Review>

<userid>105386946515690474912</userid><Review>it's surprising to find such a down-homey grillhouse in hoity-toity wine country. wood-fired everything makes the place smell like heaven, and unusual menu items like the spectacular teriyaki ostrich are a pleasant surprise in a place that looks like it wants to be a chicago steakhouse. seems like it's always crowded, which makes the service a little harried, but it's the perfect end to a long day of wine-tasting.</Review>< rating>

(Translated by Google) Very good food, very good service. Had the pork chops. Was probably a special of the day ... Were extremely well seasoned (mustard sauce and herb crust), super juicy and exactly to the point ... Clear recommendation!

<rating>5< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) We used for lunch on weekdays, but it is quite crowded even late hours.
It was very good to be able to wait while drinking wine or cocktails at the outdoor bar counter.
There are many dishes such as hamburgers and chicken rill called The America, and there is a lot of volume, but the seasoning was very delicious.

(Translated by Google) We sat down to eat at the bar and it was the best thing we could have done. We were served very well, with great cordiality and agility. The dishes did not take long to arrive and were delicious. Highly recommend! However, prepare yourself because the value of the dishes is not the cheapest.
