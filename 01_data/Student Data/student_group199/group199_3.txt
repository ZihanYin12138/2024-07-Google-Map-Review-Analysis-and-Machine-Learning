This was a very bad experience. Took my aunt to get her nails done, while getting them done the lady nicked her finger and it was bleeding. She was rough, there was a lot of nail dust and pieces not cleaned from under the nail, the shape of the nail was not straight and some sections were thicker than others it was not good service and for the amount paid (40.00) it wasn’t worth it. She was mot happy with what she received.<//Review>

I have found a new nail salon home!  My manicurist is a rockstar.  She is super professional and very personable.  Her work is impeccable and I am very particular!  The gel polish selection is expansive and very up to date with all the latest colors. This was my second time at this salon and I will be back again for sure!!!</text>

I love my manicurist!! She is super detail-oriented and nice.  I am OCD about nails and details and usually I have to turn a blind eye but I think I've finally found quality at this place!  My nails turned out top-notch quality for a work conference next week.  They really mean the "plus" in the name and offer amazing service and take great care of you when you're there. I'll definitely be coming back for high quality pampering and looking my best!< /text>

This place is amazing! We went today to get pedicures and they did a great job. They took their time to make sure our nails were perfect. Everyone working there was very friendly! They also have just about every OPI color that you could wish for. I will definitely be back!</review>

Tried dipping powder here while I was in the area shopping at my favorite outlet mall. I could not be happier with this. Went in on Sunday and had to wait a little but I thing it was worth it. My dip nails look perfect!!! Everyone is friendly and skilled. I always look forward to a pedicure or dip manicure here!< /text>

<review>They are very rough on your hands and rush through to get to the next customer.  Their $35 pedicure does not include any kind of massage on your legs and feet!! Such a RIP off!! Skin around my nails ached and bled after. They were not cleaning the stations in between customers either.</review>< Pictures>

<review>I wish I could give this review a absolute zero. They messed up on my friends nails that cost way too much for what we ended up with. The next day we asked if they could redo 3 of them but they instead only cut them. My friend and I don’t recommend to anyone to get there acrylics done here. They had terrible customer service and were talking bad about us to redo it when they are the ones who messed up. We will never come back to this nail spa and recommend no one to come as well.< /review>< Pictures>

They should have the option of 0 stars horrible service we went in there to get our feet & nails done but it was too packed so when one of the employees come up to us  to see if we still want our feet and nails done even tho every chair was full and had no space for us. So we kindly told her no and will be back first thing in the morning she give us and angry face and says something to the other workers and they all turn back at us and she had a male worker come up to 4 of us ALL women to tell us why are we still here and  motioned us to get out . Very disappointing and  disgusting</Review>

SADLY That is the lowest you can go on Stars. FIRST AND LAST Time I will be going there. Worst service ever!!!! Ugh!! My nails look like a little girl did them literally. She used the same gloves that were used on the client before me and probably even the one before, they were filled with Different nail polish color, she cut me as well during the manicure, and she still wanted to charge me for the original price. Worst,Dirty, unprofessional job!!!</text>

I loved how they do an affordable pedicure ! It was nice and they did a good job! The only problem was that i did my nails too on my regular nail and i had matte and a couple hours later one nail chipped and the paint had gone off but i went back and they fixed it for me ! Besides that i will continue to go for pedicures only!</text>

Great low cost pedicure but hard upsell. Would rather pay 15 without the discomfort of saying no so many times< /review>

This place will never get my business again. They're horrible about making appointments, I called ahead of time and came in when they told me to, just for me to wait in a pedicure chair with no water for 25 mins.<//text>

Evan was quick to respond back- he had all answers that I inquired about and seemed to care about my needs. Every conversation we had he should be eager and ready to help me get exactly what was needed.this is exactly the customer care that is not found too much now a days. He was patient and just all round a nice person.<//text>

I just spoke with Evan Shaw and switch over my insurance win I tell you the tone in his voice was so up beat I felt like I’ve known him for awhile. He speaks very clear and explain to me in details everything . I could go on and on but I’ll stop there you  catch my draft. Never the less I’m all sign up and still excited about my choice. Shouting from the roof top give Evan Shaw a call he will for sure take care of you oh and tell him I sent you! Have a Great day and if you can’t don’t you dare go messing up Evans day😂</review>

I used their services about 6 years ago and was well taken cared of by Paul. This time around when I got a new car, I was saddened that Paul was not with the company anymore but was referred to Evan. Well Evan more than lived up to my expectations. He was quick to respond and got me my insurance in no time at all. He made sure the process was as expedient and effortless as possible. Will definitely recommend using their services.</text>

If I could give this company more than 5 stars I would. I have been with BMP insurance for about 3 years and my insurance agent Oscar Mora is amazing. For the past three years he has always found me the best prices and has truly taken care of me. I would HIGHLY recommend him for any one who is looking for someone with compassion, good intentions, and who is truly going to help you get the best car insurance price. Thank you BMP and thank you Oscar. If I werent moving to Texas I would be getting insurance from you guys till the end of time. 12/10</review>

<Text>Love working with BMP. Husband always helps me find the best priced policy for my needs. He is always very informative and helpful. He makes the confusing insurance process way smoother for someone who doesn’t totally understand it like myself. He also helps with contacting the DMV and getting documents over and getting through red tape. I will always work with them and recommend them, especially Eric!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Amazing service and great quality customer service. Evan Shaw, what would I do without you. You are very competitive, I was seconds away from going to another company and you went above and beyond to ensure I was satisfied and taken care of. You were my one stop shop and I can't thank you enough for saving me and my headache today. If you're looking for insurance and you want someone that has your best interest Evan is the man. Please request for him. Thanks again Evan you're an asset to the company!!!</Text>

Extremely fast and easy to find the very best Insurance for you needs! They are thorough, professional, friendly and very helpful explaining all you need to know and any questions you may have. I am completely satisfied with their amazing service and relieved to know how quickly they work with the DMV at filing all documents. I highly recommend BMP Insurance due to my great personal experience I had with them.</Text>

<Review>Pleased with how smooth the process is with setting up a new policy or inquiring on a existing policy. Highly recommend Eric as your broker. He’s very thorough in explaining how everything works and has a great attitude at all times. Thanks again Eric!

Only opportunity is the communication with claims can be a little frustrating. I see the improvements in the works though..  overall a good company to have insurance with.</Review><Name>Marissa Godinez< /Name>< Response>

No matter what day or time miles is on it and available and always flexible with prices and accommodation  the bmp staff is also very pleasant and responsive when assisting.

BMP Insurance worked quickly to meet our needs and provided exactly what we were looking for.  It also saved our law firm a substantial amount of money on the commercial insurance, which made it totally worth the switch.  Thank you!< /Review>

I have been buying my auto insurance from Oscar at BMP for more than thirty years and he always gets me a good deal. Oscar even hooked me up when I forgot my policy was due and had to call at the last minute from a pay phone deep in a National Park about thirty years ago.
BMP has taken care of me and I do recommend them.</Review>

Eric was very helpful and knowledgeable and patient in helping me to choose the policy that best fit my needs. I had been in contact with several companies and although BMP was not necessarily the least expensive I feel the policy I purchased best fits my needs . His tone of voice the way he spoke and his patience and knowledge are very confidence inspiring. Thank you for your assistance Eric it is much appreciated</text>

Awful service. Eric had originally got me a decent policy. But after a few years I called in to get higher coverage on my vehicle so I could drive my children on school field trips.  Eric talked me into a policy more then double in price.  That was fine except that I paid $1800 for that policy and I was still being charged monthly by the previous insurer.  Eric didn't respond so I called the previous company and canceled.  I was not refunded the full amount.  I put in many calls to Eric and received no help.  I finally called the new insurance company and they discovered Eric had accidentally cancelled that policy the day I had paid for it.  So my insurance lapsed and caused me much stress. Eric still has not returned my calls.  I will be filing a complaint against his license.</review>

Miles helped me find an insurance rate that was extremely affordable. He took the time to research a quality insurance policy that worked with my budget. I recommend going to BMP if you live in the Los Angeles area and I continue to use the plan that Miles helped me obtain. I fully suggest contacting him if you're looking for friendly service and reasonable prices!!!</text>

<review>Celeste and Oscar were very helpful both are professional at what they do and are very knowledgeable. Getting insurance over the phone has been super easy and Oscar made sure that I was helped in anything I needed. Having paperwork emailed and signed back made the process so much easier. Beats going to the office and prices can’t be beat !! Would recommend going to them for insurance !</review>< UserId.>

Miles was very helpful. I went into the phone call already irritated by the process of trying to find insurance but he made it so simple and painless. He cut straight to the chase, got things done, all while being friendly and personable. Everything was handled so quickly yet all my questions were answered. He even helped take care of some DMV business for me! I never leave reviews for anything... but the time and headache he saved me made me feel more than happy to share my experience. I definitely ended that phone call feeling like if I ever did have some type of accident or issue, I would be able to easily get a hold of him and have him help me out.<//review>

I absolutely love their customer service, not only that they were eager to help. My rep RJ and Ocarina's was the best they were there to help answer any question that I have and they were able to find me the the lowest price possible.< /text>

<Text>My roommate gave me the number to speak with Oscar, and I am so glad I listened to him! Insurance is a task that most of us do not like to complete, but Oscar made the process quick and easy. He was personable and knowledgeable and I felt well taken care of. I would highly recommend giving BMP a call & asking for Oscar if you are in need of insurance. Thank you for your help!< /Text>< pictures>

This place rocks!  My account became inactive because of non payment but Eric helped me get my car back on the road and covered with insurance! With my recent speeding ticket he was able to do what he can to help get me the least paying payment and that's exactly what he did! I was in the middle of something at the time he returned my call but he made the process quick and easy. I gave him the payment over the phone and he informed the DMV of my coverage and instantly I felt relieved of the stress I was having of not having insurance coverage. They give people like me second chances and I would definitely  recommend them to help you out! thanks Eric for being so helpful and polite when I spoke to you over the phone! You were awesome!<//review>

We have to purchase $2M auto liability due to the requirement of the office complex we move to.  Not to many insurance company can meet that amount or were very expensive.  BMP was able to come to our rescue not only with the coverage but at a very decent price.  Thank you so much.<//text>

Getting my new insurance policy with BMP i was lucky to speak to Evan Shaw, he was absolutely professiontional.  Of all of the insurance agencies that I’ve spoken to, Evan Shaw was absolutely the most professional. Make you speak to very quick he will find you the best cheap deal in less than 15mins 😏 thanks so much again Evan.

Excellent, very attentive and take the guess work out of finding insurance - I've used them for years!  Worth the fee as they will find the cheapest and best insurance for you saving hours of time.</Review>

<Time>1461957701677</Time><Text>The worst insurance company I have EVER dealt with!! They don't deserve a star at all. They have been a hassle since they received my down payment, same day. I was quoted one price and charged another. I filled and signed the form for auto pay within my time frame and sent it back and following payment I received a letter saying it was cancelled due to non payment. I called talked to Raphael and the supervisor was helpful and admitted that it was their fault. Raphael on the other hand was not trying to help until I talked to the supervisor. Raphael sent me another form with an envelope already filled and stamped, i signed the paper and mailed it back, again, I receive a cancellation letter and I call and it's Raphael again that answers. He was not trying to help at all. First he said that the post office loses mail and then goes on to saying they lose mail all the time and I asked for supervisor or manager he said he was manager. I said no your not because the last time I talked to you your transferred me to your supervisor. We went back and forth and it went from supervisor is not here to she no longer works here and managers are not in. Horrible experience! If they get rid of Raphael and Oscar's Miscommunicating and misquoting self they might get more stars. Also check policy before signing and paying. Their services cost way more then the actual coverage and it's definitely not worth a penny.<//Text>< Response>

The best agency that you can count on. They were fast and handle their business. Eric Pappas was very helpful in finding the right insurance for me, truly had my best interest.

This company doesn't even deserve 1 star. I used them for over 5 years and it is a Hassel to do anything with them. It's hard to change cars or policys, and they aren't even the cheapest. Then when I finally took the time to fill out everything they wanted to cancel my policy, they never subit it to the insurance that the policy is with. So I got charged every month as if I still had the policy. I didn't notice for 3 months because it was auto payed. Then when I found out I called them and they said they need copies of my new policy and more paperwork to verify. So I spend more time to do everything they want, and the insurance sends me back 45 dollars for stopping the insurance for this month.. not starting 3 months ago. So now I'm over 500 dollars into paying a insurance I don't want and still don't know when and if I will get my money back.< /review>

<Review>Received a quote from them, he kept claiming I was getting the lowest rate and that he got the down payment as low as he could yet after I spoke with someone at Freeway Insurance they gave me both a lower monthly rate and a lower down payment. I have been trying to call them for the last hour and get no answer. Sent to voicemail each time.<//Review></record>

I've never paid cash and used points for fuel discount. I told cashier this and that I wanted to use points. He processed transaction, said have a nice day and walked away. I get to pump, and no discount. I have 50cents a gallon rewards, that's a lot, and i saved it up for fill up,but it was now busy and I just pumped and left because he was not friendly. Lower priced gas isnt worth the poor customer service.< /text>

<text>I liked that it was less 3.29 a gallon, But easy to drive and maneuver around others to get in, pay at pump, drive out and easy to get back on the  freeway. Only thing....And this is the only thing nd those in line .  The s as Fenway gas food and drink stop here sooo small and seemed busy, but could run a lot smoother, have 2 cashiers and keypads during busiest hours, and make enter line here clear.   Otherwise those already in line are dealing with small  cramped area and customers start to wrap around it like rollercoaster lines lol  🚗<//text><Date>1532901760598</Date><UserId.>103655837385537349303<//UserId.>< gmap_id>

I was lucky visit on bright shiny, but windy day, so the view was just great! Usually it’s gloomy, moist and foggy, but I still would recommend to go there

Sunday was very busy and hard to find a spot for parking, but the view and emotions we’ve got totally worth the trouble! Recommending

My friends had their vehicle broken into and all of their belongings and luggage stolen today. Back and side windows smashed. For all of the signs around many tourist areas warning about vehicle theft, it sure would be nice if there was police presence in these locations. Haven’t seen one cop or security guard at any of the locations we’ve visited, yet obviously it’s a well known issue. Nice lookin San Francisco 👌< /Text>

The Golden Gate Bridge is a fantastic place to take in the beauty and immensity of this storied and iconic bridge.

It’s just another wonderful “must-see” during a visit to the phenomenal city of San Francisco.

You never know what the weather will hold and in fact it was very foggy over the bridge most of the time during our most recent visit to the Bay Area.

But we were still able to appreciate it and our kids always enjoy driving over it!</text>

< Review>
After talking one of my daughters to San Francisco Internationals Airport to pick up her boyfriend. We drove thought the city and went across the Golden Gate Bridge. When it’s your first time in the bay. We had to drive over one of the biggest tourist icons in California.

Great spot to stop and get a picture. Here’s a couple shots of my daughter and her boyfriend in front of the bridge.< /Review>

Great place to take my family and friends when they visit me. The views are amazing backdrops for photos, especially since the Golden Gate bridge is right there.
When I was a ride share driver, this was a popular spot for visitors. Sometimes directly from the airport, with luggage before a conference or interview.< /text>

<Text>Parked here to take a break from driving
Dozed Off for a few minutes and woke up to bicycle cops outside my Car staring at me.
So that was startling

This place used to be much more relaxed... Not sure why Its changed..

It's a beautiful spot regardless though< /Text>< pics>

A must stop rest area for wonderful views of San Francisco from the north and the restrooms are well maintained. We are there early in the morning when there are fewer people and a relatively relaxing break can be enjoyed!< /review>

Be on the look out for this car driving around and notify the bridge patrol if you do see it. Plate doesn’t belong to the car either so look out for the car and the plate as they seem to swap plates on cars.<//Review><rating>1</rating>< user>

<text>We were rushed for time but bridge fans should have a little time to explore this place for pictures.

Sausalito and Tiburon are visible on the way out and best seen from afar atop an open top hop-on-hop-off bus.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>You can stay here for free for 8 hours at a time within a 24 hour period. Perfect place to rest up or park while you explore San Francisco. My friend and I slept in the bushes and had some of the best night’s sleep listening to the ocean.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>When I’m too tired or too sleepy from driving Uber i stop here and rest before going home to San Rafael. Yes i know San Rafael is only a few minutes away but I don’t want to take any chances of falling asleep behind the wheel. The only bad thing about this place is the men’s bathroom is disgusting! It’s kind a embarrassing to our visitors coming to visit our City. Please clean it up!</Review>< Date>

<text>(Translated by Google) You can take a break here, there is enough seating and the car can be parked comfortably. However, it is quite windy in parts. From here you can see the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. However, Alcatraz is very far away.

(Original)
Man kann hier gut eine Pause machen es gibt genug Sitzmöglichkeiten und das Auto kann man auch ganz bequem abstellen. Es ist zum Teil allerdings ganz schön windig. Von hier aus kann man die Golden Gate Bridge super sehen und auch Alcatraz. Allerdings ist Alcatraz sehr weit weg.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1_sgJ4n8jTFkouQrpD5PWplqWbIpNLm80OmSZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdqFb4NyFsM4AyfGdw-NuJdAx8E82_qf9oz7tG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS7hswyW3kksg5aqaiNHu2XVqF3k4tjoR1dS2f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

Besides a little RIF-RAF outside, because this IS Lake Elsinore....lol. This store is about as good as a Dollar store can get. It's kept well. The employees are friendly. Just watch out for the customers. Dollar Store is still no 99¢ Store. But they do have a good selection of quality items including food. For such a all store, there is still plenty of meat or protein items, to make any meal you need. And DONT FORGET.......$1 BAGS OF ICE.......PRICELESS.</Text>

The best place to save on Greeting cards for every occasion. The staff is friendly and helpful. Shelfs are well stocked and neat. Gasoline treatment is a bargain in auto area.</Review>

Stopped by to grab a few items for crafting.  They had a wide variety of Xmas decorations,  stocking stuffers and inventory.  Staff was all very pleasant.  Much better store than the one off Mission Tail.< /Review>

Great place to shop. Product does change so don't expect to buy something and it always be there. It is very hot inside . I think they should work on fixing the AC . Overall I like shopping there.<//Review>

Went early today to the store and found it well stocked with Christmas candies and decorations. The checker was pleasant, in a great mood and made the transaction easy.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Went in for DIY Christmas decorations and DIY materials. Great prices for great finds (wreath forms,  floral arrangements, ribbons, floral wire, felt, glitter, glitter glue, etc. etc.)! I was in the store for a while because of all the goodies I wanted to buy, but had to remind myself to not take on to many projects; and to only do holiday DIYs right now or else I'd end up spending so much (the dollars add up!)!. Check Dollar Tree out for materials before spending more money at the larger stores -- highly recommended. Also, they have lots of Christmas decorations out on the floor right now -- ornaments, stockings, wrapping paper, bows, etc. Love Dollar Tree. And the employees are always very nice and helpful.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This is my go to place when I need to get supplies for my lessons. It is inexpensive and they pretty much have the basics for craft projects, science experiments, and prizes.</Review>

Me & my girlfriend are both getting our braces done here as well as all my veneers crowns.  Dr SIngh & Dr Saper both are excellent at what they do.  Very straightforward and honest people to talk to.  The staff is amazing and make you feel right at home.  They state of the art technology and are honest when they coordinate your insurance benefits and will take the time to educate you.  Thanks guys from Ben & Ashley< /review>

<Time>1571783580038<//Time><review>Go here, dear reader. Just go here. I've been to Pure Dental in Murrieta 3 times now, and each time has been a great experience. Dr. Singh runs the best dentistry I have ever had the privilege of attending. Why do I say this? First of all, the staff is super nice, cheery, and accommodating, and to top it off--professional. From Carina at the reception area (which is classy, clean, and comfortable) to dental assistants Vivi and Bailey--everyone is personable and does an all around amazing job at what they do. Dr. Singh himself clearly creates a positive work atmosphere that helps his assistants do their job with sincere smiles on their faces. And Dr. Singh himself clearly prides himself in providing skilled and compassionate care to his patients. The small talk he made with me as I sat in the dentists chair put me at ease and gave me the sense that Dr. Singh genuinely cares about the person behind the teeth. I have no doubt my oral hygiene strategy is in good hands.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< Name>

The office itself is very clean and it doesn’t make you feel like you’re waiting in those typical “waiting rooms” when you visit a dentist.  It doesn’t feel cold, if you know what I mean.

Dr. Singh and his team are very friendly, personable, and professional.  They are so helpful and so accommodating!  Thank you for always maintaining a fun and positive visit every time :)</review>

I also had all of my metal cavities from childhood replaced so I had work done on three or four more occasions. Each time, the care and service was exceptional. Flawless.

They also made me a mouth guard because I grind my teeth, especially at night. Val did great work and got it right the first time. It has helped me for sure.

This doctor even responded to his office staff while on vacation when I had a serious need. True story.

May the Force be with you, and Pure Dental!< /Review>< pictures>

If you’re looking for a honest, friendly, and caring dentist, then Dr.Singh is the one for you. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I’m always nervous that the office will push unnecessary procedures onto me and that wasn’t the case at all. Plus the work done is done with care and great attention to detail. My cleanings had almost always been rushed, but not at Pure dental. I felt very welcomed and I will definitely be coming back.<//Text>

First of all I do not like Dentist so I was reluctant to even go but after reading the reviews I went.  I found that Dr. Singh Was very knowledgeable, very nice,   Asked me what my issues were, not telling me like other dentist have in the past that I’ve gone too, and he is always asking if I’m OK. The staff is also very nice and knowledgeable and offer water or coffee while you wait. Dr. Singh is a golden retriever dog lover just as my wife  and I are as well  so we had a lot to talk about a lot of things in common.    So as I said in the beginning I still don’t like Dentist , but if you have to go to a dentist I would suggest Dr. Singh and his crew!</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I love this office!! The doctors are absolutely amazing. I, like most people, have a fear of the dentist but not anymore. Dr.Singh does my cleanings and check ups and makes it such a pleasant experience. Dr.Saper is my braces doctor. I got my braces off in September and since have felt so much more confident smiling. I have routine appointments to make sure my retainers are fitting well. The whole office staff is so kind & caring. They always make sure I am well taken care of. Thank you Pure Dental!!!

I have been coming to get my treatment done with Dr. Singh at Pure Dental for the past couple years. I can truly say love this office and I feel very comfortable here. I even referred my family to come here and get their treatment done and they even shared with me how happy they are with Dr. Singh and the staff at Pure Dental. The practice is clean and always smells good. Dr. Singh is very professional, friendly and always makes me and my family feel comfortable, even before starting any treatment, because I used to get nervous all the time when I was a child. Having Netflix and sometimes music with headphones always helps me out. I really like how him and his assistants go over my treatment before sending over the person who is in charge of going over insurance, and even she is very aware of clinical things that are going on with my oral health. Thank you Pure Dental for always taking care of mine and my family's needs.</Review>

As a result, they were in pretty bad shape (could be worse but they were still messed up). After months of debating if I should go to the dentist or save the embarrassment and call it a lost cause, I decided to finally go.

Going to Pure Dental of Murrieta & Orthodontics was one of the best choices I have ever made. Making the first call was easy and going into the office for the first time I was greeted with a warm welcome and a comforting environment.

Everyone there will take care of you with no problem at all while making you feel welcomed and happy to see you. They are a great team and would recommend this office to my friends and family.

These guys are awesome. Dont hesitate, go to this office because I dont think theres another office as great as this!

They even called Triple A when I locked my keys in my car (lol).< /Text>< Pics>

I have not been to a dentist in a while, and I was nervous about what I would be told needed to be done. The girls & the doctor explained everything in detail and even showed me models of what needed to be done, which made it easier to understand.  They have great financing options which allowed me to do all my treatment without having to worry about a big payment. I also like the fact that they have   a hygienist that goes few times a month, because she did a very detailed cleaning.<//text>< pics>

I felt that my experience was personal, easy, and that everyone I came across genuinely cared about me. I was thoroughly informed of what would be taking place, and what I could expect in the future - overall great communication. I normally get stressed out at the dentist, and didn’t feel that way at Pure Dental of Murrieta. I definitely plan to continue coming here.</text>

I've been to a lot of dentists in the past, this is the best place so far. The dentist is great- very thorough and he genually cares about quality and your concerns. The staff is amazing and should go with the same recognition. I don't like going to the dentist for the simple fact that it's a dentist and it can be nerve wrecking. However from the front staff to the back office and eventually the dentist himself I was ,awestruck by the comfort and warmth provided. Can I give higher then 5 stars? Because they deserve them all. Thank you Dr.Singh & staff!!!</Text>

I was really scared to go into the office at first, but when I met the staff they took that fear away. Dr.Singh really lives up to the hype that I have heard from friends who referred me to him. He is so easy going and explains everything in a way I can understand. The girls there also have 5 star customer service, I felt like I was a famous person at the way they catered to me.

<text>I had such a great experience at this office . They took me out of pain, when no other office would see me the same day.  Elisa the office manager assured me she can help me find a way to do the treatment at an affordable cost, and she did! They have so many different options for financing there is no way you can not get approved. Dr. Singh & val put me as ease and took me out of pain. I am forever grateful to them and recommend them to all of my family and friends. I even got $50 credit towards my next treatment for referring a family member. 💞</text>< rate>

< Review>
I'm 3 visits in and up until now, I have to give this place 5 stars. The staff is incredibly friendly and professional. On my second visit I had an onlay replaced so I had a temporary onlay placed until my permanent one became ready. Dr Singh personally called me to make sure I was doing ok without any discomfort and reminded me to come in if discomfort ever occurred. Major points for that. Plenty of entertainment while you wait and complimentary drinks. 5 stars from me< /Review>

<review>I called in to make an appointment for the orthodontist and general dentist. They were able to get me in to see both that very same week! My first experience over the phone with Elisa was really good she helped guide me in what the steps would be to be seen and explained they had payment options which was my biggest concern. Once I went in I was amazed by the appearance it is not your normal dentist office it is very modern. You walk in and it smells great, they have a fridge with waters, then their is coffee, and  you can watch movies or shows in their lobby!

I met Corina who took my xrays and was very sweet and patient since I have a gag reflex and can be pretty difficult to take xrays on. After the xrays I met Valerie & Dr. Singh who explained what treatment I needed, and helped me get in the right step s for the orthodontist.
He is a good looking doctor to ladies! Forget Dr.Mcdreamy , Dr. Singh is the new Mc dreamy lol.

That Friday I saw dr saper for braces which I have been wanting since my 20's but was never able to afford. He explained to me the different options I had for braces to correct by Bite. He is such a smart doctor and is very detailed which I appreciated because I rather know everything then be surprised later.

Sorry for the rant but an office like this deserves it !

I have my next appointment for ortho next month, then my 3 month cleaning in August!!!!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>I Love pure dental i will never go anywhere else elisa was very sweet and helpful from the moment i spoke with her regarding my son we had been to a couple other dentist offices like western dental which was a nightmare.
Everyone at pure dental valerie was very sweet and so helpful. I brought my son in and Dr singh fixed him up and got him out of pain he even called my son the next day to see how he was. Dr singh is awesome.my son thought there was no hope for his teeth but dr singh gave him back the hope and confidence he needed again. Thank u pure dental u are all a blessing.

Great place to go in and get a cut 💈 I always go in as a walk-in and get taken care of promptly (mornings). Barbers have great conversation and will remember you after a couple of times. Really wish they offered water to customers.  Preferred barbers (Pepe, Jr., Omar)< /Text>

<Text>What a great experience. I needed a hair cut before we left for vacation. My friend told me about 5 Star Cuts. Never heard of them. Great group of people. Very friendly and professional. They did exactly what I asked from them. They were also cool with my gf puppy explore around. I would definitely go back and tell my family and friends.

I have been meaning to get a real shave and a hair cut at a barber shop for some time and I finally had it done today. I got straight razor shave to my face and head from Jake and what a great experience! Great atmosphere, highly skilled, very professional.  I will definitely be going back.</text>

In all fairness, I did drop In for my sons haircut. But we waited happily while our barber perfected his clients cut.
Once my son was in the chair, it got hectic.
I saw this barber's "perfection/skill" on the previous child's hair cut <3
Next time... I'll make an appointment
Truth be told... $20 and well... this is our comb over:(<//Text>

Great prices and they were able to accommodate a walk in :) Three crew were on duty. This was my first barbershop experience and was very pleasent. Told her I wanted a faux hawk and let her do the rest of the details, and it turned out way cleaner than anything I have ever gotten at great clips. Shop was air conditioned and had a low key vibe, which I enjoy when I am by myself. Great conversation!</review>

<date>1612889882920<//date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>I ordered from here via DoorDash during COVID times so I can't speak on the physical restaurant.

We were visiting the Santa Cruz area last week and my partner and I were craving Indian food.  He spent all of last year there, while I went on vacation for a few weeks in India.  I have to say that I have no complaints about the food.  I'm not sure if we ordered on a good day, but everything was absolutely delicious.

We started off with the saag paneer.  This was probably my favorite dish of the bunch.  I'm a huge fan of paneer so I will definitely be ordering this again.  It was super flavorful and paired beautifully with some garlic naan.

We also ordered the mixed tandoori.  While in India, we had proper tandoori chicken.  Although, it tasted similar, it didn't quite hit the mark for me.  Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but I've had better.

Lastly, we had the chicken biriyani.  The chicken in this was soooooo tasty.  The chicken was so tender and beautifully seasoned.

I wasn't having high hopes for Indian food in Santa Cruz, but I can confidently say that this place is pretty good.  I would recommend trying it out if you are in the area.< /text>< pics>

Had the sag paneer and chicken tikka masala. Food was good and worth going back for. Dishes do not come with rice or naan, but the portions are big. I could’ve easily shared each dish with another person. As of today (3/31) there’s no dine-in seating or patio available.<//Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>I ordered takeout last night. I gotta say, this is the best Indian food I've had since l lived in Seattle. No need to go over the hill for really great Indian food. I had samosas, butter naan, papdam for appetizers. Main courses were chicken biriyani and chicken masala. Side dish of saag paneer. First of all it was made fast and piping hot. Got it home and was amazed by the amount of food. I fed three people and had leftovers. The flavor of everything was delicious, fragrant, and just a wee spicy like I like it! This will be my go-to Indian food in Santa Cruz from now on. Oh, I didn't even mention how friendly they are! Bonus!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< rating>

<review>The food was good and reasonable price, and enough for 2 people but I am going to give 4 star, ( I could give lower actually), because there is only one guy, since no dine in now due to covid, and they don't answer the phone, so people just stand in line in cold and they messed up our order. I asked for "Daal Soup" but he gave me "Tarka Daal" .<//review>< name>

Frozen vegetables in the vegetarian dishes. I mean, they are vegetarian dishes! I ordered garlic Naan and received plain Naan. Every sause that came with the meal appeared watered down to cut food cost. Overall, I would say if you like frozen meals this isn't a bad one. I would have loved a fresh meal to represent what the Culture has to offer. You likely won't find that here though, unfortunately.<//review>

Been going here for over 20 years and still love it. Their buffet has so many awesome dishes for a great price. For dinner every dish is good and you get huge portions, again at a great price. My favorites are the chicken tikka masala and chicken vindaloo, but everything is out of this world. Other Indian places in town are more expensive and don't give you as much. Indian food is my absolute favorite and I've tried places in San Francisco, San Jose, Amsterdam, and this is still my number one pick.</text>

<Review>Food is fresh, tasty, a good value and served in generous portions. Nightly veg and meat combo platters. Whoever is running the tandoori oven knows what they are doing! Really nice atmosphere and great service. The restaurant changed hands 4 months ago and the people running it now are putting a lot of care and attention into the food and maintaining a very clean space.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808e402731935c07:0x4b2cd9506574ea58<//gmapID></record>

Not as nice as Sitar was, but that closed down. The food is okay, prices have increased, quantities have reduced, but it still is the best Indian restaurant in town. Closest thing you'll find to authentic Indian food in SC.< /text>

<text>First of all CLEAN. Second of all very, very good! No gritty not knowing how to mix spices and stomach aches you get frequently from the other places around here. Went and saw them since the CV SIP issues, and they have it dialed in for take out. It’s perfection. Paneer tikka is on point, is not gritty and tastes impeccable. I would spend most of my life sending bad reviews in this town so I only wrote good reviews. This is like the third one in my life. This food is like Santa Clara/Milbrae good....Just saying.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Being an Indian, I recommend this place to all. The food is awesome, definitely worth a lot more than what we pay for. The chicken pieces were soft, the lamb pieces were with bone and very soft, perfectly cooked. The naan was soft as well. I didn’t like the dessert, the coconut in carrot pudding (halwa) seemed to be bad. We finished our meal with chai, and that tasted brilliant too! Perfectly prepared. Apart from the food, service was fast, there were many people and was fast moving. Everything was fresh.</Text>< UserId.>

<Review>Best.  Indian. Cuisine.  I've never had better.  Everything is freshly prepared, quality ingredients, cooked to perfection.  Be sure to try the samosas.  And the aloo gobi is simply sublime.  Yum, yum, yum.< /Review>< Pics>

<username>Gurman Dhami</username><review>Went there for the lunch buffet and I was not disappointed. They had a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I tried the goat curry and chicken tikka masala which were cooked to perfection. Very nice and clean restaurant, great ambience, very kind management, and fantastic food. I will surely be back. Would definitely recommend.</review>< Response>

This place had a good decor and welcoming, however the service was pathetic and food was at best average. Here are some specifics....

1. Party of 10, called in before coming if they could accommodate... they said yes.
2. Ordered all food in one shot... snacks came and the chutneys about 10 mins later, even after aski g for them
3. All the food came,  but no plates... Plates came abour 5 minutes after the food was out... putting the food cold
4. Daal Makhni had no salt... zilch
5. Garlic naan had no garlic and was so thick
6. We had to call for even a water refill...very poor service</review>

<review>I really enjoyed the great Indian! It's so much better than when I went before with the previous management. Fresh garlic naan at lunch. Real veggies in the curries. Delicious Chai! All in a very clean environment. I definitely recommend it. Having eaten Indian food my whole life I was pleasantly surprised at the quality here.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Review>I probably eat at the taj at least twice a week! I've been going since it was Maharaja, then moved to Sitar downtown, and now back in it's original home. I think it's 100% the best indian food in Santa Cruz, and the nicest people working there for sure<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< UserId.>

<Review>We were visiting from LA and stopped by fortuitously, just for the heck of it. Boy did we get lucky!
1. The food was off the  charts good. The lamb masala was exceptionally flavorful and fresh.
2. Goat biryani was unmatched! I have tasted Indian food in many places. This was special!
3. Garlic naan was fresh from the oven and tasted like magic.
4. The service was good, polite and hospitable.
5. The background music was the same as in every Indian restaurant.  :)
6. Lastly, the place was very clean.
Overall, it's a very nice mom and pop place which I highly recommend. I will definitely come back here.<//Review>< date>

Wow! This place is nothing like the old Royal Taj.  This has great food, is clean as can be, a large selection at the buffet, and staff that will do anything in their power to please!  It's a new favorite for us and I hope everybody finds out about it because  I hope they will stick around for years to come!< /review>

Honestly some of the best food that I've had in Santa Cruz. Very fairly priced as well, and definitely earned a repeat customer. Staff was very nice and helped us out immensely. When the waiter saw that I was really enjoying the Gulab Jamun (definitely reccomend for those with a sweet tooth), he brought out another free of charge. Waiter with the curly mustache was super friendly and helpful.

All around great experience. Disregard the reviews from 6 years ago the place is brand new and amazing.< /Review>

Had the lamb curry, chicken tandoori, dal saag, chicken birani, and gulab jamun and was literally blown away at how good it all tasted. Our waiter was so sweet and made sure we enjoyed our food and experience (I don’t remember his name but he had a curly mustache). Since the reopening, the food and service is perfect. There is also a 10% discount for students! Will definitely be coming back many times.</review>

<Text>Edit update: Had a fantastic dinner, wonderful chicken Tika Masala. Nan was a little burnt but honestly I hate under done, so that was a better outcome by my tastes. My daughters Tandori chicken was great.

I was supper happy to see Royal Taj reopen after a long closure. Sadly my first visit to the lunch buffet left a bit to be desired. Food was all lukewarm and had clearly been sitting and not refreshed 12:30 on a Thursday. Loved that there was some garlic nan but a bunch of the pieces were burnt and it was sitting cold.
Otherwise it was all just ok, but for 13 bucks?
I hope to be back for a regular meal and that it will satisfy the way the used to. I have very fond memories of feast chicken tika and garlic nan with somosa‘s. I’ll update then.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>To start off, the waitress was very rude and not helpful. He just stood there without saying s**t..the place smelled very funky, not the typical Indian smell..and to finish it off the food was horible..we got the tandoori plater and everything was warm on the out side and ice cold in the inside..don't recommend this place at all!!< /text>< Gmap_id>

My seven year old daughter has been a student for a few months now and absolutely loves it. I was a little concerned she may be too young for it, but the one on one virtual teaching has been great and I've been amazed with her progress. She gives her coach an idea for a game she would like to create and then he walks her through all of the coding to do it. She actually created a fully functional video game after a few sessions - it's obviously very basic but still, it's a functioning game! She's always so proud of her progress and I think she's developing a very valuable skill set that she'll be able to use in a variety of ways. The Director at the San Ramon school that we use is also great when it comes to communicating with me and has accommodated a few schedule changes without any problems.</review>

<Review>The coaches are personable and are able to customize the lesson plan depending on the child’s ability. They are available to talk and responds quickly .Ms Dede does the 1st screening for the child along with the coach for the assessment which adds value to the session in terms of current level and some estimations on what we can accomplish together in the next few weeks and going further.
Thanks

My 8 year old really looks forward to his weekly coding session. I like that it is helping him with critical thinking skills, goal setting and working through the steps of a project to completion. Whether or not he ends up coding those are skills he can use. And it is just fun.<//review>

Our experience with them started with my Jr. hi son, who from all accounts was enjoying and learning a lot from his class. This was evident by his high marks on his AP Com Sci class. My 9-yo started with SR city youngster computer camp, which he enjoyed immensely! When the camp ended, he begged me to enroll him to more classes. He's back at it and learning and having fun. I can see his sense of accomplishment & confidence increasing after each class.</Review>

My son is extremely excited every week for class. Without the online option we never would have been able to participate. We have been looking for a coder school for a long time and we found a good one. Dede is easy to talk to and she understands if you have any questions. Thank you for making these classes available.<//text>

We have been with the coder school for a little over the month. My 11 year old LOVES it! He has had an awesome coach who sends me notes after every class. The notes are so personalized and feel like they are really engaging and getting to know my kid. The one-on-one lessons have taught my son SO much in such a short time. He’s loving the M.I.T. Scratch platform and he excitedly shows us what he’s created very week. His coach also tells us that he’s working on his own time and creating games to share with them. I’m really blown away by how much he has learned in such a short time. Recently, scheduling had us switch coaches and yesterday was my son’s first time with the new coach. I was worried bc he had such a great repoire with Talia, but he loves his new coach William, as well! He was worried, but last night gave me the thumbs up and said he was happy with his new coach and excited to work with him, too. Dede has always been great about communicating with me.   I can’t recommend this company enough.< /Review>

My son has been attending San Ramon Coding School for over a year.  Flexible hours after school and weekend made it possible.  He enjoyed the class and coach Harsha has been great.  Dede was very accommodated to flexible schedule.  The school followed Contra Costa health guideline and switched to online classes promptly.  Schedule reminders are sent out weekly.  It's well managed.  We are very please with the staff and coaches.</Text>

My 9 year old daughter LOVES this class.  She takes it with a good friend and it's something she looks forward to every week. Coach Eamon is patient, thoughtful, and indulgent when it comes to letting them explore their interests (anyone wanna make more Pokemon games?) In fact, it's so much fun that I think she forgets she is actually learning, but she is! And I feel happy knowing she is learning skills that be valuable in life.<//review>

It's creative, develops problem solving skills, logic and reasoning. There's some math in there too. Much more interesting and worthwhile than I thought it would be. The teachers are knowledgable and the classes run smoothly. It's been a good thing all around.</Review>< pics>

My children are enjoying their coding classes and really understanding the concepts fundamentally. The coaches are great and guide the kid well. Most importantly the kids are having fun while learning. The curriculum is very agile based on the child’s interest.</Review>

My son has really enjoyed learning Coding from the Coder School San Ramon, and he has picked up some very useful skills and knowledge.  They have great coaches, and this business is very well managed.  Communication is excellent in general, and they also impressed by very quickly and smoothly transitioning to remote learning mode at the onset of the Covid pandemic.  We highly recommend the Coder School San Ramon.<//Text>

My coach Harsha understands all of my questions and I barely waste any time communicating my ideas and questions with him. He doesn't waste time and so far he's always had something new ready for me to learn whenever I exhaust one topic. He understands that I'd rather focus on my one game than make a bunch of small projects,  and I learn that way.<//text>

<text>My son loves CoderSchool.  He looks forward to it each week and comes away excited for more abs proud of what he created and learned.  He needed some extra attention and the CoderSchool communicated with us very well and with a service heart to find him a coach he would pair well with and the attention to care to make a proper match has produced results in his learning and happiness.  Definitely recommend.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>My son started coding with Coach Kannan less than a year ago.He had great experience with His coach.Coach Kannan is very patient, knowledgeable and good with the kids.My child is very talkative and always have question.Coach Kannan knows very well how to handle him and keep him focused while answering all queries.My child learnt scratch and Now he is learning Python with him and he is really enjoying and learning well. Best part is the school is very flexible .Ms Dede is very flexible and was able to provide makeup class( even if we change it very last minute) without any hassle whenever needed.Now my child is learning online with his Coach and I can see same quality as in any in person class.I highly recommend “The coder School” and their teachers in providing quality education to the present upcoming generations.Keep up the good work” the coder school”.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< UserId.>

<Review>My son has been taking classes at The Coder School for the last year.  He loves his classes.  There is a lot of flexibility with the projects they complete and the instructors are fun to work with.  Communication about classes, billing, rescheduling is easy.  He wishes we had an unlimited coder school budget!  Wants to work there when he is old enough.  Highly recommend.</Review>< Date>

My kids love Coder school! They’ve been going for 6 months and are excited to keep learning more. The code coaches are great and send a weekly update so I know what each kid is learning. My kids are so comfortable there and enjoy everything about the experience. The owner DeDe is friendly and organized and makes everyone feel welcome.
They have group classes, individual coaching, and my 12 year old really likes the 2 students with 1 coach ratio. There’s something for everyone!</text>

Both my children have been going here for a year. They have learned so much in that time, from html to python. Their coach moves them at their pace and makes it fun. I find my kids coding at home for fun and they love going to their weekly sessions. They’ve had a couple of different coaches and all of them have been amazing. Dede, the administrator, is amazing, pairs the kids up with coaches who the kids will work well with. I can’t praise them enough, and am excited to see how much the kids learn in the future!</Text>

<Review>It was the first time my son (14 year old) will try out coding and we enrolled him in four camps at Coder School. Java, python, and the 2 game development programs. He enjoyed them all but developed a special preference for either java or python. Coder School made the summer camp experience fun and doable for a newcomer like him. CS also email reports on what the kids did during the week and sent the link for their project (when I couldn’t come to the parent visit schedule). It was great to see my son’s coding activity (I am no coder and it looks legit ;-)  Dede, the manager, was more than helpful and encouraging the whole time. Quick to respond to emails and answer my questions. You can tell from the staff (when I first inquired) their passion to teach the kids about coding. We have signed up for the monthly after school program with 2:1 student/teacher ratio, which i think is a good thing to get really hands-on and customized training. ;-)<//Review>< name>

Dede, one of the San Ramon school owners, always greets us with a smile and encourages my kids to explore and develop their ideas. The instructors that we've had are also very  engaging and personable. Would highly recommend!< /Review>

We have had a very good experience with Dede the general ,manager on initial trial lesson and scheduling with the right instructor personality wise. the kids love their instructor and are enjoying the class. We have almost completed 6 months and will be renewing for another 6 months for sure. Additionally, Dede now wants to start a middle school coding team to enter into competitions and am excited to see how the kids get more confident with their coding skills.< /Review>

<review>This store promised me money back for turning in my old phone that could be used as installment payments towards the new phone and I am now on my SECOND phone call to TMobile to get this corrected as it has not been on the first 3 bills. It takes an hour and a half every time I call and according to the most recent bill it was a waste of time because nothing was done on the last phone call.  This store needs to stop promising customers discounts that they cannot deliver!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>Love love love this store! I had Metro for over 2 years and decided to switch to T-Mobile. I had such an amazing experience. I came in on Monday and was able to port over my number. They had a special promotion where I traded in my Samsung Galaxy S9 for the new OnePlus 7Tpro Mclaren and got so many perks. My phones paid off because of the trade in and the service is lightning fast. Sure it's a little bit more than Metro, but with Metro my service did not work. Not even in my house...with the wifi on... and for $60 it was not worth it.
Jacklynn was super friendly, quick and efficient. I came in 3 separate days and she made sure I was getting the best deal with my service and was able to explain everything to where I felt confident with my choices. I am already loving how amazing my connection is. Thank you much!!!

Update: I'm in Vietnam right now for vacation and my phone's the only one that works outside of the hotel 😂 5g best thing in the world.

Share my experience, the young lady at the counter was very informative and very knowledgeable about her job and products and things like that. Although a lot of the advertised deals didn't seem to make sense buy one phone get one phone not really true. But I guess is just like any other cell company out there right now you walk through that door you end up spending $1,000. Anyway like I say staff was very friendly and knowledgeable just wasn't super thrilled with the price.<//review>

I wanted to commend this store and the manager, Matthew, in particular for their efforts in helping me get my $250 credit for turning in my iPhone 6 during their trade-in, trade-up program.  I had turned in my phone to their store in October 2018 but never received the credit even though the store had checked out my phone and said it was fine.  Finally, in January 2019, T-Mobile called me to tell me that my credit was being denied because they said my phone had water damage.  This didn't make sense to me as I've never exposed my phone to water.  In any event, the T-Mobile rep on the phone was completely uncompromising with me even though I had turned in my phone in good faith and had been told my phone would receive the credit.  I told her that this episode had severely harmed my very positive relationship with T-Mobile that they had earned with me as a customer of more than 15 years.  Fortunately, the local store where I had turned in my phone made this right for me by providing me with a courtesy credit in the full amount to my account.  Matthew should be highly commended for his efforts to regain my customer satisfaction and loyalty after being treated so poorly by T-Mobile corporate.< /text>

Kyle is the best T-mobile employee I have ever met. He deserves some sort of a corporate award. Incredibly helpful, very polite, and remarkably patient... Such people change the entire perspective on a business. The assistance he offered yesterday was the best we've ever received at T-mobile.< /Text>

USAF Veteran: Erase that star. Walked in this afternoon, greeted by Yana. Been in before; today noone was waiting. Two other staff working. I tried explain what I needed; that I'm not very tech savvy. Negative answers right up front. I felt she didn't want to help me. (I showed her proof of my service, reminded her of the ad. Recent ad honor; working with Veterans.)She didn't show me how to do what I ask instead did it herself. All so negative though I said I need to understand before I leave. I felt demeaned; embarrassed.  There was no one waiting . Just me. I left almost in tears. Will return to friendly staff where I originally bought my phone in Folsom.  Yana said she doesn't work there.  She had on T Mobile shirt; name tag. I admit I don't know things but she who suppose know things lacks empathy; customer service skills. I'm a veteran she didn't help. When I ask her let's stop she was rude. Disappointed! Shame on you; other staff who witnessed; didn't intercede.  No stars from me.< /review>

<Review>Do not go to the store if you're having a problem with your device I accidentally turned on a voice program that's on my phone and did not know how to take it off or turn it off the girl tells me they are not trained for this we don't help you with your phone's we help you if you want to buy a new one I got very aggravated with her told her I was tempted to shut off my phone and also told her I was tempted to have my boss shut off all 70 + phones for the company I work for I don't understand why you have people on staff that don't even know how to operate the phones they should know something or at least have a number they can call to get help when our phones malfunction where we supposed to go</Review>< pics>

I will admit that I am a biased customer of T-Mobile in CA and previously in Europe, but for a cell company I still feel that their customer service and offerings far surpass that of their rivals.  Their staff are ultimately focused on customer  service and yes, I may have had a few issues, but this store has always been abile to sort out any problems I may have had.

The store is easily accessible, clean and modern.  They have a good stock range, they are happy to let you browse and they do not act like second hand car salesmen and pressure you.  As for TMOBILE in general, I have found that their coverage is good, the prices beat their main stream competitiors and despite the appalling website, well worth considering, even if you are mid contact with someone else. But that's your fault for not using TMobile in the first place.<//text>

They  only  had  2 people  who  could  help  you . We waited  20 min  and  left . Had  to  use  the  bathroom  and  they  didn't  have a restroom  that  we could  use , once  we left  we decided  not  to  go back . They  basically  had little  to  offer .< /text>

<review>Been to all the TMOBZ around sac and this is the best one BY FAR. Been with tmobile for 5 years and every time I've been here I've received excellent customer service. Shout out to Aurora for educating me on all the different devices and accessories currently available! I went to the tmobile in the sunrise mall at one point because this location was closed and it was just the worst. It's worth the wait just to go to this location!!!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>Tacos, burritos are super great! They are prompt and provide great service. They are always there when you don't want to cook dinner or a late night snack. My kids love it too,  they ask for a song. Lol<//text>< resp>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Went here after midnight & was surprised by how busy it was at that time of night. I guess a lot of people in California have the 420 munchies! Ordered two asada tacos & a al pastor burrito with cheese & whole beans. I quickly realized that I should have ordered more tacos & nixed the burrito. The burrito is where a star was lost here. Refried beans instead of whole, cheese was only at the end of the burrito & the al pastor was basically non existent. I think I saw three or four pieces of pork. But hey, it's called Tacos Mexico for a reason. Fantastic & regret not ordering more. 5 stars worthy, but burrito was, meh.< /review>< Resp>

Great food, but there are times when the meat can be too hard to chew on or they get the wrong order/don't give you the condiments one asks for. Still a worthy place to eat at.< /review>

The food isn't bad. Open late if not 24-hours  I believe, its pretty cheap for the food portions too. Customer service could be better.</Review>

Love how I can order I’ve true phone quickly and pick up the food in 5 mins, makes my drive from work to home in the mornings easier since I don’t have to wait for the food to be ready!And it’s always so good! I think the guys on Atlantic ave and bear have seen me and my buddies drunk and craving delicious tacos and burritos so many times haha</text>

I live in Pasadena, but i like this tacos Mexico in particular because the food here is freshly made, and the staff is very professional, but super friendly as well! At the moment you can only eat outside... But back when things were good, You'd eat inside, which is very clean. And although a small place, they have 3 flat screen TV's, and they're always showing soccer matches from Europe, Mexico, and USA. Oh let's not forget the old-school jukebox which contains a few recent hits, and many older spanish jams... Banda, Norteño, Mariachi, etc.

I love this tiny taco joint, the food is delicious and reasonably priced! I always go for the tacos... But I've had everything on the menu, and it's all good!

<text>Price is right. Food was good. Service was good. Same flavor from back in the days. I used to come to Bell High over ten years ago. I remember this place, had to stop by and check if they still had the OG flavor! And they still got it!<//text>< GmapID>

The food was rushed, so my order came out wrong after asking several times. The chips used in the nachos were stale and the beans went bad. Ordered tacos and there was more fat and cartilage than actually meat. Very disappointed I had to throw everything away<//review>

The guy overcharged me.  I was told they had a promo on Tuesdays.  Tacos were half off.  I asked him about it and said that they were $1.50.  The place was not clean and the tacos weren’t that good.  They did have a really nice salsa though.<//text>

These tacos are the best. Full of flavor and good sized.  Be careful of the green sauce, its very spicy. It's best to habe the salsa on the side until you know what your palate can tolerate.</review>

<review>Why 4 stars? Because they are open 24/7. Their food (burritos, tacos, quesadillas, etc.) is OK (2.5 stars). Prices are a bit on the high side. On a good note, they are quick in getting your order out. And the place is always clean.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

This Tacos Mexico in particular is the best one. Been coming here since 1993, and like it as much now as I did the first time I decided to give it a shot. The food is delicious, the staff is very clean, and super friendly. My personal favorite is the BUCHE burrito Ortega the CARNITAS taco. Both with the red sauce. Make sure to request the salsa on the side, since it's a bit spicy. The music that auto plays from the juke box is a bit loud, but goes well with the atmosphere as well as the soccer channel on both TV's. It's a very small restaurant with indoor/outdoor seating. You should definitely stop by to try, I'm sure you'll like it as much as I do. And the prices are on the cheaper side too!< /Review>

I've been to many other Tacos Mexico, and I would not recommend at all. This one, located in the tiny city of Bell is fantastic. The customer service is beyond good, these guys are always in the best of moods. Their good spirit reflects on the food... This little taco joint prepares and serves the best tacos, burritos, sopes, tostadas, and tortas infantiles the area. Trust me I know tacos, I grew up on them! And the prices are definitely cheap. For instance 1 burrito 2 tacos + soda will run you around $12, I truly recommend this place. Nothing fancy, just delicious food, great mood, and fantastic prices. Try the buche and or carnitas tacos with the red sauce! Oh, they also offer all you can eat grilled onions.
Thank you< /Text>

I really regret going. I got a burrito of asada and 4 tacos de carnitas. I think they got my tacos wrong I got home and they were really oily and the meat was steamed, never had tacos that way, taste like mush... Almost puked. This was at 3am. The horchta was bomb.</Text>

Tacos Mexico is no longer the same for years, not only the food has changed, the bathroom in this place unfortunately is horrible the smell is disgusting the tables smell very bad for me if even a restaurant does not care where its customers wash their hands Where they sit is not good. You lose your appetite after washing your hands. I smell a bathroom. So sitting at tables that smell bad is even worse.
