Great staff here... they were terrific... thank you Leonardo and Reyna and the super tech who installed the screen protector on the new Note 5G Ultra I got for a gift and doing all the stuff needed to the Otter Box cover protection.

You were so patient with us!!! And we got it accomplished! 😁😁😁😁😁👍👍👍👍👍</Text>

This place is always sparsely staffed... What can one expect, it's Barstow, for Chrissake. Yesterday, though, there was only one person working for the 20 minutes that I was there, so the fact that it always takes forever to make the tiniest of changes was less than amusing to myself & the gentleman ahead of me waiting. Long story short, associate was still waiting while the couple he served chose from oh so many options, guy in front of me was still trying to be patient when I gave up & decided I could switch to better phone I bought online another time after 20 minutes.
Note to self - and others - avoid this place weekdays during lunch hour.<//review>

I bought two phones from T Mobiles customer service line and they shipped them to this store for pick up. The manager refused the package so they got sent backed. I called the manager and asked if I can come buy the phones from his store and he said yes. I told him I would be by 6-630 and once I get there he said he doesn’t have them in stock. Doesn’t take much to be a manager with T mobile apparently. Theirs more to the story than this but at least have the decency to check and not keep wasting peoples time. Even after he sent back my phones shipped from T mobile he still didn’t try to smooth the situation.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c47c9010a657a9:0xf2aeb2be78de2b51<//gmap_id></record>

Bad customer service. The manager on duty on 8 August 2018 at 1:57pm didn't get his name because I was too bad at his service. He was a total disaster. He wasn't willing to help me trade in my phone even when I had to go all the way to customer service. He presented every obstacle so I don't trade in my phone for a new one. Highly disappointed and I am never going back there for anything .
They deserve no star what so ever</text>

<text>Best Japanese BBQ experience. The quality cannot get any better and really is as good as famous BBQ restaurants in Japan. I have been to Gifu to have hida beef and it is basically the same as Yazawa. My friend made me go with her all the way to Gifu which is really far from Tokyo, when we already have beef of the same level in LA.

My favorite cut of meat will always be the beef tongue and their thick cut beef tongue is melt in your mouth delicious. A little goes a long way for rich pieces of meat like this, so I wouldn't suggest ordering too much.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb_PMTIzETTSdLRreHGJHbj2mwxje0nUNMv2Bq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

The worst omakase I've ever been to. Slow service with a sever with an attitude.
We ordered Yazawa Omakase and it took over 50 minutes JUST FOR THE APPITIZERS AND 9 PIECES OF MEAT that we're supposed to grill on our own, even though the store was not busy. The table behind us were served way faster with the same server.
Also ordered garlic rice and asked for spoons, and some random sauce was on the spoons. We complained to the server a couple of times and asked for the manager(was off) and the server's attitude was what made our experience worse. We lost our appetite and asked for the bill without getting the last portion of the omakase because of her attitude.
What kind of omakase takes that long especially when it comes raw and you cook it for yourself?
I didn't expect such service at a pricey restaurant that I wouldn't even get at McDonald's. Shout out to the female japanese server that ruined our night :)!

Holy mother of god. I went omakase and loved every bit of it. It's extremely pricey but worth every penny. I've been looking for a steakhouse with premium cuts and this checked every box. Excellent service. This is high quality meat from JAPAN be prepared to pay accordingly.</Text>

The wagyu appetizer simply melted in your mouth, I particularly loved the tartar. Each and every meat had a intense marbling and a distinct and memorable flavor. It was definitely a splurge, but well worth it! There's like 5 different kinds of omakase: 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180. The minimum of $100 has 3 raw beef appetizers and 5 different of cuts (4 pieces of beef tongue and skirt steak, then it's just 2 slices of each meat after that because the quality gets better!) The more expensive omakases have uni. Omakase doesn't come with any sides so I got the Yazawa salad (light and refreshing!) and garlic rice with wagyu beef in clay pot.
PARKING: street metered, but you know how that is around Rodeo Dr...so just make your life easier and park in the parking stalls behind the yazawa building.<//Text>

<Review>All the beef served are wagyu and has an excellent quality. We had the Chef's special Omakase and it was worth it. We upgraded to some Stuff with truffles. It is good for special occasions or if you fell
Like a Japanese Bbq type of food. They bring the meats and you Bbq yourself on the grill on your table.
Customer service is great. They also have a great wine list. I definitely recommend this place. They also follow good disinfection/cleaning protocols during this time. All the servers and other workers are wearing a mask and face shield.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

100/100. Popular in other countries like the origin Japan and Singapore, you will most likely find the best authentic Japanese barbecue in Los Angeles.<//text>

This place is more about tasting than eating. They sell a special experience and they deliver. We had the chef's choice and I think this is the best meat I ever had. The service is on spot as well: our waiter stayed at our table and prepared the different pieces of wagyu right in front of us (you can also do that yourself if you think you know better). He also had an interesting story to tell for each course. Also his wine recommendation was perfect. Even the side dishes were a special experience on their own. Definitely come here if you're into really good beef - it's worth the (admittedly hefty) price.< /text>

<Text>Very high end Japanese Bbq restaurant in Beverly Hills. I've had Jumbo in Tokyo 3x and was looking forward to Yazawa.
The food here is amazing. It's omakase with a ton of courses so be prepared to leave happy and full!
We opted for the highest omakase with upgrades of caviar and the meal did not disappoint!
Everything here just melts in your mouth and the meats just get better and better with the next course.<//Text><Time>1566486345946<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place is all quality.  To the people who complain about price: if you get this type of quality, you obviously should be expected to pay more ... unless you are actually in Japan. One of the best meals I've ever had in Cali. The customer service was on point.  The server explained every cut of beef and actually stayed there and cooked it for us.  I'll be back!< /Text>< Response>

They somehow transport you to Japan during your dining experience with flavors and textures that were unknown by westerners until just a short while ago when opening. They have locations in Tokyo, Singapore and one in Milan. The Yazawa company is a meat company first and foremost so every succulent piece of beef is superb. After getting a 6 course meal you just want to ask for more and more. Luckily for them they called last call otherwise we would have been there all night. If you do get out to Beverly Hills and like insanely delicious food with excellent wait staff for an intimate dining experience, this is the spot. Cannot recommend it enough.<//Review><UserId.>101587060115239089044</UserId.>< response>

Barbecue unlike any you've had with the most perfect thin sliced wagyu.  Among the top meat eating experiences of my life.  We did the most expensive omakase menu for a special occasion and it was totally worth it.</Review>

<review>Allow me to preface this review by stating that I know Japanese meat. I grew up partially in Japan and have traveled throughout the country extensively. I’ve eaten yakiniku more times than I could count. My meal at Yazawa was an absolute disaster.

I was in LA for a few days for a show and decided to seek out yakiniku, as there aren’t too many places outside of Japan where you can get Japanese beef. A quick Yelp search revealed that my relatively-nearby options were Yazawa and Manpuku. It looked like Manpuku only served US “wagyu”, so I opted for Yazawa, as my entire quest originated from the desire to have Japanese beef.

While Yazawa did serve Japanese A4/A5 wagyu (and the meat itself was good), the chef/restaurant/owners absolutely destroyed the meat with sickening amounts of non-optional sauce (the meat - ALL cuts of the wagyu - arrived pre-soaked in the stuff). The omakase began with a 3-dish appetizer, and from the very first bite, I knew I was doomed. The tartare may as well have been tofu or ground beef from Ralph’s, because you literally could taste nothing but their nauseatingly sweet sauce - 2 out of 3 appetizer dishes were just hosed down with this stuff - they were indiscernible. An initial bite sets the tone of the meal, but whatever, maybe things would improve.

No, no they would not. The first pieces of meat were inexplicably USDA cuts. Nothing special, but not offensive, either. These unremarkable pieces were salted and peppered with no sauce, which is absolutely ridiculous - they overpower the prized wagyu with sauce, yet serve the cheap USDA cuts with an understated salt and pepper, when it’s brutally obvious that this should be the inverse. Then came our $200 meager platter of Japanese wagyu for two. And it was positively DRENCHED in Yazawa’s Signature Sauce (TM). My partner and I each tried a single bite to give it a chance, and it was terrible. All we could taste was sugar, ginger, and garlic. The sauce was cloying, the meat was woefully undersalted (and quite literally untasteable), and the experience was just depressing. Wanting to salvage something out of this meal, we asked our server to explain this saucing decision and ask if we could perhaps replace the remainder of our meat with pieces that were simply salted and peppered. We were offered nothing more than a trite, bored response of “that’s how the omakase comes”. We were never informed, via the menu or the server, that our meat would be sauced to oblivion, and never even given the option to opt for salt instead.

We explained that we are well-versed in yakiniku, and the meat was being ruined by this sauce (which we were never informed of), and Yazawa absolutely REFUSED to do anything about it - they wouldn’t replace our meat, offer us supplemental cuts, NOTHING. I honestly wished I had just walked out, but I stoically choked down the maple-syrup-coated meat and got the $300 check, whereupon they couldn’t be bothered to do so much as remove our drinks from the bill, when we clearly had a horrific experience. They were so unapologetic, it was remarkable.

Considering the price and my expectations, this may have been the worst dining experience of my entire life. Only dine here if you like the idea of a business that takes exquisite, difficult-to-acquire Japanese beef and absolutely saturates it in a foul, saccharine sugar-garlic-ginger-shoyu glaze, COMPLETELY obliterating and masking the flavor of the prized meat itself, and then selling it to rich people with no taste or palate, from a Rodeo Drive storefront. Oh, yeah, and they also soak the appetizers in the sauce. They must have buckets of the stuff in the kitchen and apply it to everything in sight with a fire hose.

Between the food and service, for what they charge and promise, this was a legitimate 0/5 for me.</review><time>1557348893083</time>< Gmap_id>

<user_id>111001598936262105015<//user_id><Rating>5</Rating><Text>So AMAZING. One of the best restaurants, and definitely the best yakiniku I've been to thus far.

Yazawa is a meat company that happens to have restaurants around the world, 12 to be exact and this location being the only one in the states. All their Wagyu beef are flown overnight from Japan and never frozen. Our server suggested to get the Omakase, but my bf and I decided to get everything a la carte as we wanted specific dishes.

Wagyu Tartar w/ Egg Yolk (3/5) - a little tough, flavoring was good but on the sweeter side. Meat didn't taste as fresh as the rest.

Assorted Kimchi (2/5) - comes with Chinese Cabbage, Radish, and Mountain Potato. It was alright, nothing special.

Yazawa-Yaki (4/5) - this is wagyu sirloin, the meat was marinated in a sweet bbq sauce and not as soft as the Zabuton, as expected, but nonetheless amazing with the egg wash. I liked that they whipped the egg yolk. This comes as a per piece order. I loved it, but my bf was not a fan.

Zabuton (5/5) - the most marbled wagyu beef on the menu. It literally melts in your mouth. I died and went to heaven when I took the first bite. Comes in 4 thin square pieces, enough for 2 people to try. Highly recommend!!

Beef Tongue (5/5) - best tongue I've ever had! Thick fresh cuts. It's 100x better than Anjin and Gyutan. It was so tender and juicy. I would recommend asking for lemon on the side and not dipping it in any sauce. Just squeeze some lemon juice on top and enjoy. Highly recommend ordering. Would come back just for this.

Garlic Japanese Wagyu Rice (5/5) - amazing wet fried rice served in a claypot which makes the rice a little crispy, my favorite. If you love garlic, I would recommend asking for extra garlic. The flavoring of the fried rice was mesmerizing. My bf was in love with this dish. Must order!!

Overall, I would highly recommend trying this place if you have the chance to. You will not be disappointed by the quality of this place. Meat quality is exceptional and I cannot wait to come back to try their omakase and other dishes. Service is a little slow, but they were nice. Place is pretty clean.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
There’s nothing like that feeling of being promptly greeted and whisked right to your table reservation. Ahh, let’s get to business! Shall we have the omakase style or a la carte? The wagyu truffle uni pairing is hard to pass up! Our a la carte plates start to roll in, love the table gestures and plate presentation - it truly must be all in the wrist! Then our mains arrive and wow, the staff’s agility is quite impressive! We’re about 36 minutes in at this point and finished most our plates and being force fed sake faster then freshmen and their 1st keg stand. We finish our soup, ahh here comes the desert menu! Nope, the bill arrived, not even a fortune cookie. One hour in and $500. I could only imagine omakase would have been like carnival ride where staff use a nerf gun to unload 7 wads of wagyu mash in your mouth from across the room. On the bright side, phone calls with my attorney seem more affordable, he only charges me $450/hour.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I like to eat and come to Los Angeles. I have to go to the two homes. I want to use YAZAWA for baking. If I want a Japanese soup pot, I will try KAGAYA in Little Tokyo.

<Text>The absolute best athletic club in the East Bay.  Plenty of equipment and classes plus a huge pool and basketball courts.  The staff are attentive and helpful.  If you stay until closing time, you will see an energetic cleaning crew maintain a level of cleanliness I have not seen in a club before.  Yes, it costs more, yet offers so much that I consider it a bargain.</Text>< rating>

$300 to be on the Waiting list. 8 months
$900 initiation fee - one time payment (after 8 months!)
$160 monthly fee -  not bad.

Talk about an exclusive gym. Oh and no fat people allowed.

I'll just go back to my poor people gym.. 24 fitness.. :D< /Text>

It’s no Equinox but a solid all around gym with a good looking suburban crowd. The basketball courts are the best part but the staff and cafe are helpful.<//review>

I've been going here since I was a baby, The establishment is great, with plenty of Maintenece, lately though, Oakwood reset the wifi router, and now has very crappy Internet, I can't stream music now since it takes such a long time to load each song. More importantly most of the members here come to work at Oakwood in the main lobby, this could prove as a huge problem.</Review>

<review>I adore this spot! They serve high quality dishes, their menu is large, The chief cook in that restaurant is a professional, I love a lot trying all their food. The food is consistently good, the attitude towards the customers  is very good too. I frequently visit this place and I not even once was discontended. I recommend it with no hesitation.< /review>< pics>

Highly recommended.  The dinuguan and ginatang kalabasa are super yummy.  I gave them high rating because of reasonable price, good customer service, food very savory and they give you generous amount of food.  I will surely go back if I am in the area.<//Text>

Took my car to get washed yesterday. They didn't clean my dashboard, door panels or cupholder. Very bad experience. Will definitely try the wash on Garfield next time.< /Text>

<text>Guy charged me for $85 after I had had a conversation with him about the $74.99 vs. 44.99. He said 74.99 offered cleaner interior. I said I'll take the 74.99. He asked if I wanted fragrance and I asked if it was extra. He didn't give answer. He just said he will take car of my car. Few minutes later he gave me invoice for $85. I said to myself okay well atleast they will shampoo carpet (leather interior) so I'll wait. This was Sunday. 2:30 PM already. At 4pm.He walked over and stated for me to pay cause they were closing. Right before I paid I asked if carpets were shampooed. He said yes. I paid. Since they were closing I left but pulled over a few blocks away. That's when I noticed my carpets not shampooed. Upon closer inspection car details is sloppy. They think that if they rub shiny armour all over that it's a detailed. No car wash people. This is sloppy and not detailed. I don't reccomend. I  have called several times and no no answer. I will stop by today to request carpets shampoo and I will difently chew them out for sloppy job and their lying. Update: May 12. I stopped by to ask why they didn't shampoo carpet. He said the $85 doesn't include it. I pointed to sign that states yes it does. They tried to convince me it doesn't. I asked for my $10 bucks back and they called me a liar. I spoke up and after 10 minutes they gave up and gave me my $10. Stay away from them.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND1nBJW_48ZJCb8ajKmFVzTmAv044K66t4oKcb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAd6AN0YbWimwhSOYOkfOyXCcIbj7wH2Pfz8KM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW1EPUTd1OVL3CXT5fl_-VF1658l5ANLQJwfEk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

I'm not sure if their machines are down but when I came to have my car washed, it was 95% hand wash and 5% machines. The wait for my car to be done was a little longer to what I'm used to. Excellent work btw👍 My car was sparkling clean on the outside and inside😍 Great attention to detail!</text>

I had been there a lot of times before and everything was good. But today I took my car to get a wash (the same I always get) and when I went yo pick it up they didn't vacuum it well there were shoe prints behind the front seats and when I politely asked the "manager" Oscar to please check on the car his reaction right away was rude and unprofessional.. He said that I wanted my car to be detailed as if I had payed a lot..  ( I always get the same wash and they always clean it) I wasn't not expecting almorall of course I know what I payed for but come on.. so he started been a smart a** and told me to go somewhere else.. worst experience ever!! Not coming back!<//text>

< Review>
This car wash is just the worst, HEED WARNING, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AS POSSIBLE!... First off everyone is just sitting down as you drive up, on top of the fact that they are already usually understaffed. Service is mediocre. The guys do a lousy job of vacuuming the vehicle for approximately 2 minutes before they run it through the machine. BEWARE as they may forget to close your doors before washing it. FYI, My car is brand new. The guy forgot to close my rear door and my car interior got soaked in the process. I didn't find out until they honked for me that it was ready. I inspect the vehicle as I usually do. The guys there expect a tip for there mediocre service and give you dirty looks if you don't tip. I noticed my car was soaked so clearly I didn't tip. I asked to speak to a manger, and was walked over to some guy that did not apologize for the damages, he simply said ok we'll take care of it. I still requested to speak to a manager, they said I would have to come back because there was nobody I could speak to. No type of remorse or customer service on this business' part. They did not offer to comp me or refund me for the terrible service and damages I received. I was so upset with this place and definitely will not be going back.</Review>

<Text>Horrible service.. Took my truck to get a hand wash and tell me they dont do it on the weekends? Seriously! Very rude staff and the cashier told me to take my truck somewhere else when I simply asked her when is a best time to bring it back... Very very rude people. I give them NO stars<//Text>< pictures>

Very bad service!! Went today to get my car washed and waited 1:45mins. When they turned in the car  to me it was still dirty. Talked to the owner ask if they can re wash it. They didn't wiped it down, and no apologies for the wait or bad service< /Review>

Bad service. They washed, dried and cleaned a car that came in 2 cars after I did. For the price I paid my experience here sucked. I will try a wash app before ever coming again.< /review>

<Review>Really happy with the level of care I receive from Dr Phillip Ford @ the 2469 Rio Linda Blvd, location. He cares about his patients. And he actually listens to my concerns, and treats me based on my concerns and his evaluation. He's not one of those doctors that have you in and out in 5 mins. He takes his time with you, And goes over things in detail to make sure you understand.

The only thing I don't like is the medical receptionist or medical assistants at the front desk. They are lazy, young and inexperienced. They hardly ever answer the phone, and spend most of their time on their cellphones or gossiping.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Dr Phillip Ford is Amazing he truley cares about my health. He is the first doctor in a really long time that has made me feel like he truley cares. He is kind and always takes time to listen to me and does not just rush me thru to get to the next patient. The referral department is another story and can use some extra care (That's why 4 stars) but other than that my experiences at this doctors office is always good< /Review>< Pictures>

While I was on the phone with them I told them that  it’s been months since I’m waiting for my ultrasound authorization (they haven’t submitted it) , he said that they will call me back. It’s been 3 days and no one called me so far . So I did spent like 5 min on the phone rating  them when they asked; but something that I need , they don’t care. Two star max for that.</Text>< Pics>

We had horrible experience with the previous PCP. Long story short, my daughter did three blood test and we never received any feedback or result from the PCP. Everytime he said there is no record of blood test, there was no blood test request in your file, why did you do it!!! Finally they changed the PCP and the current Doctor is much much better than before. Waiting time is more than 1 hour and appointment is 1-2 month in good days.< /review>

<review>They are always so welcoming and even when they are busy they will still acknowledge you and let you know they will be with you in a moment. I’ve been seen by them twice and I’ve never felt so cared for like I have with AllMed by previous doctors I’ve had. That’s why I love AllMed!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The staff does not act as though they care, at all, about you, or your related problems. I never, ever, get a reminder call, for appointments, when you need to call them, you're on hold for an unreasonable amount of time, (20 minutes, or longer) they never, ever, return a call, when a message is left for them, and then when you FINALLY get them on the phone, they're in a hurry to get off the phone. I have been to ALL of their locations, and ALL of them are this way. I'm seriously considering switching providers. I have nothing good to say about ALLMED, or their staff however the reason for 2 stars instead of one is because I really, really, like Dr. Ford, at the Rio Linda ALLMED. He's a great, kind, caring Dr. He Cares about, and is invested in your health.< /text>

Doctors are good. Receptionists are very rude and could care less about patients health. Also takes forever to get an appointment as I have been waiting 2 months now to be seen.< /review>

Funny people say the receptionists were bad but they were about the best thing I saw or had the pleasure of talking with.

To preface this review by saying I have 3 years of nursing school and 6 years of LPN nursing experience.

I had an Appointment with PA Philip Ford and it wasn't very positive. In fact I would feel better if PA Ford changed his first name to "Ford" and his last name to "Truck", because that is exactly what he is.....A "TRUCK".

Why? Well first of all he told me that my problem isn't really his specialty. That's fine, and I understand that. Dr. Truck gave me another perscription of what I currently had and some positive effects during the trial. That's fine. Dr. Truck sent the perscription to the wrong pharmacy and I had to wait an hour in the parking lot with a 102 temperature.

It's been 6 days and it isn't working. Fever is gone but pain and swelling still a go, so I made it a point to call 3 more times and had to keep calling to get him to change the perscription.

I researched Google for my particular problem and it specifically suggested 4 medications. 3 of them I've already tried during my nightmare 4 months of having this infection so I was hoping for the strongest one Google recommended. I also inquired with my other Doctor friends back home and they agreed that I should try the stronger one.

Well when I called the last time Dr. Truck said he would send the perscription in. Well I went to the pharmacy today and guess what was there? NOTHING, Dr. Truck didn't send my perscription to the right CVS eventhough he mirrored the words out of my mouth as I was saying the correct address. This was the second time he sent my drugs to the wrong pharmacy.

Well it's back to playing phone tag and I had to call back again with no response. So I decided to call again before they closed. The receptionist said that, "Dr. Truck,  changed my perscription twice and he's not going to change it anymore!" WTF?

First of all you changed it once, today when you sent it to the wrong pharmacy. Second, you sent an antibiotic that I was on last month and didn't work at all. I guess you would have known that if you actually looked at my chart. Third, if you would just look in your PDR you could have suggested the right medication in the beginning but you're too much of an amateur to care.

Thank you Dr. Truck for nothing! He also said I should just wait to see my specialist which All-Med hasn't sent the paperwork to Sutter for yet. It's nice sitting here in pain for someone else's incompetance.

Well I better focus on my specialist because Dr. Truck sucks. So when I called Sutter the receptionist said she didn't receive the paperwork yet. How funny, I received the paperwork at my house but the specialist hasn't received anything.

I would like Dr. Truck (AKA PA Ford) to call me personally and apologize for being un-caring and inept at his duties.</Review>

<Review>Im rating this Allmed medical in Rio linda as a 5 because of Dr. Ford and the staff. He is my Primary doctor and he listens to me and takes care of my medical issues I have. The women in the reception office are very nice and helpful. Unlike other Allmed facilities where I wouldnt even give
them a 2...yes you still have to jump through some hoops with the medical system, but its when you feel that you are getting the help that you are seeking
and you are treated with respect & not like other places where they can be very rude and dont care about their jobs and treat people like cattle! Thank you, Allmed in Rio linda. I drive farther out to your location but with a glad heart and a smile on my face. I appreciate you guys!

I've been trying to get a referral for 2 months. I sure hope It's not serious. Funny thing is I already have another Dr's opinion that it is potentially life threatening. Still get no answer and no call back. The worst customer service I have ever experienced.<//text>

<text>Dr. Bosvish is impatient and nasty. He called me a liar and threatened to throw me out of the office. The problem is my kidneys and bladder stopped working after a few days and I couldnt urinate after taking a blood pressure med. It is a very unusual reaction but it can happen. I ended up in the ER and was told to stop taking the medication and see the Dr. Again. So I did and that's when he yelled and threatened me. He gave me another medication and told me not to stop taking it. The inability to urinate started on day 3. So I stopped taking the pills and was able to urinate late the next day. On Monday I left work and went to see  Dr. Bosvich during emergency walk in time. They let me sit an hour and then told me he wouldn't see me but I could make an appointment for the following week.
I was feeling so horrible that I went home. I couldn't believe that he refused to see me when I was so pale and shaky, Altho he was there and had the time. 7 hours later I felt so badly that I called Ask A Nurse and she was so concerned because I felt so strange that she insisted I go to the ER. So I did. As it turns out I was dehydrated and my electrolites were out of whack. They stated that it was a good thing I got into the ER.
Dr. Bosvich is a jerk and I wouldn't take my dog to
see him.
HE GETS A BIG ZERO ON BEDSIDE MANNER.
HE NEEDS TO LISTEN TO HIS PATIENTS. WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS. Not stupid idiots you can talk down to.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>La Hacienda consistently has great produce. The prices extremely  fluctuate. For example, on many occasions, the tomatoes may increase .50 cents up to a dollar overnight. The meat counter is clean and we'll priced as is the cheese and seafood products. The customer service is always quick and friendly. The store has 5 stars from me because it owns a mobile taco stand that is located in the parking lot. Every food item that I tried from the truck has been excellent and we'll prepared. I highly recommend shopping at this San Mateo, Ca location.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

The people were not very nice at this store. Not very helpful at all. Will not return. It's unfortunate because we had a very large order to place we ended up going to smart & final or they were much more helpful.<//Text>

Cheap produce and excellent fresh dairy options. A well kept and abundant meat counter. American goods are notably more expensive but a great resource for authentic Hispanic imports. They have an extensive meat and dairy counter with homemade salsa and delicious country-style sour cream< /Text>

The managers are such as bad people all the personal that work there are so bad they treat me with my kids by my side in a bad way I got my puppy with me because is an emotional support animal for my son that has special needs and I took the letter that I have from the doctor and even do they treat me so bad in front of the people that were there.. and it was the manager that treat me like that.. I felt so bad so discriminate.. that I will never go to that store.. they don’t know how to treat the customers.. and even that they see me with a child with special need..</text>

<Review>Friendly and very helpful to non Spanish speakers. They have a nice fresh produce and fruit selection in the front and extensive fresh butchered meat, poultry, seafood and cheese selection at the back corner of the store. We also go here for their tacqueria. Portions are large and plentiful. Try their freshly made juices and drinks, besides the different Mexican sodas.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Arrived at 8:35 to buy groceries, just to be greeted by a security guard to tell me that they close at 8:30 even though their online hours say that they close at 9. Either they were just trying to go home early or they need to update their hours. Either way not coming back.</text>

< Review>
Really poor service in the kitchen.
Tjw cashier sneeze couple of of times cpver wotj her arm didn't wash her hands.
I wanted a chiken soup their menu say they have on Tuesday but cashier said they don't have.
My friend order 4 chiken tacoa ask for green salsa she they don't have.
What kind of Taqueria don't have green salsa?
By the way didn't see the cashier wash her hands she is handling food and money at the same time. :((((
I use to come here in the past and food and service was great after seen this i won't be back.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I'm just giving you the star because if I can't leave my comment because for me I would not let anything owners and manager of the Treasury do something with that pity and innocent staff they have because if they continue like this they will not last long they are losing many people who like to buy there but with the very bad experience that one with a disque employees who has does not want to return or recommend their store

(Original)
Sólo te estoy dando la estrella por que si no no puedo dejar mi comentario por que por mi no te dejaría nada dueños y mánager de la Hacienda hagan algo con ese pesimo y innorante personal que tienen por que si siguen así no durarán mucho tiempo están perdiendo mucha gente que nos gusta comprar ahí pero con la muy mala experiencia que pasa uno con disque empleados que tiene no que dan ganas de regresar ni de recomendar su tienda</text>

Great perfume prices for people driving into Tijuana.
Liquor prices are definitely worth taking a look at if your planning a celebration south of the border.<//review>

Rude workers, little selection, more expensive by alot to store accross street. Plus if a worker doesn't like u they'll lie then cut u off even if u followed the duty free rules.<//Review>

I celebrated my graduation last night in this great restaurant. happy to tell that we enjoyed a awesome evening and the restaurant was unquestionably one of the reasons for that happy meeting. The stuff  helped in a splendid style, the meals were appetizing and my friends were so  delighted. We shall definitely visit again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.</review>

<review>Where to start! I been coming here for years now it always hits the spot but today was different, I know they change to new Management. I usually order my 2 dishes & botana. No flavor at all if they made it quick I'm very disappointed, with this covid 19 going on, I would understand if Manager would take it serious.  I saw him prepare my food without gloves & facemask. Plus he was touching everything in the bar plus handling other customers orders without gloves. Hopefully they change their ways of handling things. Probably won't comeback anytime soon!< /review>< user_name>

<Review>It was kind of late and we wanted seafood to eat, we searched on Google and it gave us this place it was 5 stars and it said it was open until midnight, so we decided to check it out, as soon as we walked into the restaurant my boyfriend liked the place, they have music, lights like a disco night a DJ TV screens and people there looked like they were having a good time. We had aguachile, shrimp caldo and oysters on the shell, the food was good but a little pricey considering it's not a fancy restaurant and it's not in a nice area, it was karaoke night and someone was celebrating their birthday so we end up having some cake, it was nice of them to share with us a piece. The service was good and we had a nice time.</Review>< response>

Food was ok but the cocktail was almost all water and the tostadas were stale. The place was so hot, I checked the thermostat and it read 87 when it was in the 90s outside. Also, NO soap or toilet paper in the restroom.<//review>

Service was slow. They took about 30 minutes to take our order and another 30 to serve us our dinner. Not the greatest Mexican - Japanese restaurant. Live music band and very loud during dinner time. There are better options for good Mexican or even Japanese food.< /Review>

Mexican theme sushi restaurant? Good prices on the food and beer! The food is good. Most of the dishes come with cream cheese, so I just make sure to order without it and it's great! Live DJ and karaoke. The waitresses are pretty hot too!<//review>

< Review>
I was recommended to this place by a friend, I have to say the I'm very happy I went. There food was delicious and great customer services. They kept checking on us and making sure we were good.  They had band and there music was also great. If your looking a good place to eat when visiting the area I will definitely recommended to go and try it out. I ordered the "Aguachiles" and there "Sinaloense Roll" it was delicious. I'm definitely going back again.</Review>

<Text>Came to this place because I was invited. How ever this is like the saying of don't judge a book by its cover. From the outside it doesn't look so great. But once you open the doors and walk in it's an entirely different world. This place is very clean, Art Deco is rustic and very ranch like. The servers were very easy going but enthusiastic at the same time (Great service from their part). The food was something that I did not expect.  We got some shrimp cucarachas (roaches) and the way these thing are prepared is just an exciting party of flavor ready to explode in your mouth. They were delicious. Also tried the carne asada plate, comes with a side of rice, beans, and a small salad. The beef itself was very very flavorful and juicy. We also had a michelada and even this thing come with an excellent presentation that will not only enchant your eyes but leave your taste buds wanting more.
Over all the food Is definitely something I would expect from a high end restaurant that might be overlooking the beach out somewhere expensive. But it's not. It's in our neighborhood and it's definitely a jewel in itself. I would recommend you go try this place.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>I chose this place for lunch because it was #1 restaurant on TripAdvisor when I looked for places in downtown Boise on a recent visit from out of state. I knew I had made the right choice when I walked up 10 minutes before opening time and there was already a line of 20 people standing outside.

(Translated by Google) Rich but they serve the Shrimp broth very little and as it lacks more vegetables and taste the sushi 🍣 it's good 👍

(Original)
Rico pero sirven el caldo de Camarón muy poquito y como que le falta más verduras y sabor el sushi 🍣   esta bien  👍</Text>

Great and comprehensive selection of wines and spirits. Picked up some Jameson and Wild Turkey. A little pricier than a grocery store but wayyy more options. Unfortunately the clerk behind the counter was not very friendly which brought down the experience.<//review>

Picked up my daughter flying in.  Have never been to this city before.  Getting to the airport, navigating the airport was super easy.  And the guys directing traffic did great also.< /Text>

The airport was and usually always is clean and well maintained. I was there in the early AM so no issue with parking.  Lot was well lit.  My experience with Southwest airlines is a different story.  4.5 hour delay on flight from Austin to SJC.  No explanation for the delay. Do yourself a favor, DON'T FLY Southwest!<//Text>

<Review>This is a very nice airport. I don't fly frequently, so I cannot compare amenities with other airports very well.
What I can say is that the people working here, as well as fellow travelers were positive and helpful.
Kudos especially to the gentleman waiting at the sidewalk for his ride, who assisted me when I was having trouble loading my suitcases into my daughter's car.
This just reinforces my observation that the people of San Jose are truly some of the nicest people in the country.
Thank you for your kindness.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

The airport itself is very clean and nice for an old building. I wish it had more to choose from in their stores besides coke products, a pepsi now and then would be nice and more open restaurants with full menus. Those were the only minuses, it wasn't crowded when I came in or leaving a week later. I would recommend flying in and out of here as opposed to nearby airports due to crowds,  it's worth it.< /Text>

It's been almost two years since we last traveled and to say I was nervous was an understatement. However,  SJC took a lot of safety precautions that helped alleviate my worries,  especially when traveling with my twin toddlers who are not currently vaccinated.  Mask are required and they ask that everyone maintains socially distant from one another.  In the security line,  they have plexiglass dividing security from travelers.  In the bathroom,  they've added dividers between each sink to ensure a more individualized space.  Chairs has sign to ensure that ppl are seated away from one another.  Security and employees at the airport were very friendly and helpful,  especially since we were traveling with a double stroller and toddlers who got confused with all that was happening around them.  We had a great experience at SJC, but then again,  we've airways had a positive experience here.  It's great to see the airport continue to expand and improve in the last two decade.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Going through TSA Pre was a little different from before the pandemic. You have to wear a mask, show your ID, not your boarding pass, and when they have your information on screen, they ask that you pull down your mask so they can make sure it is you.

For Southwest, there is a watering station to fill up your bottle on the left. To the right is a Peets, Chick-fil-A, and further down, a Starbucks,  a Hudson News (where I got a turkey sandwich and some chips for our meal) and a sushi restaurant.  The Chick-fil-A was open by 7am and the line was long.

The lounge area was clean. And since the plane isn't full, it wasn't as crowded to line up for the plane.</Review>< Pics>

This airport is easy to get to and very convenient.
It is a very friendly airport. You may ask anyone with questions or help.

Their Lost and Found office is amazing! I had left my laptop in a bin at TSA security check and they called me the next day that it was found and turned in.
I was instructed to fill out a from on the day I found out my laptop was missing. The form was online and was so easy to fill out and submit.

This airport is very organized especially for Uber.
I got picked by Uber easily and conveniently.

I recommend to everyone when you can to fly San Jose Airport.</Review>

Small but friendly airport. It's covid times and likely more open otherwise, but I still managed to find mediocre food,  drinks to go only, and friendly service on my layover. Bathrooms clean. Security looked short and simple. Long lines anywhere with decent food. Crazy how friendly everyone was to me, they were amazingly nice. Ten minutes after my earliest boarding time started they called my name over the loud speaker to come to the flight, there were five others and they warned us each by our full names of the pending take off over the loud speaker with 20 minutes to spare. Clearly everyone working here is focused on helping passengers have a successful and comfortable travel experience- much appreciated!! Great airport, but very small. I bet late or early there's nothing open so be prepared for that, but you'll find everything you need right here.< /Text>

Love the airport. Proximity to South Bay is awesome. Easy to navigate medium size airport. Flights can sometimes be expensive compared to SFO.</Text>

<Review>Going through TSA Pre was a little different from before the pandemic. You have to wear a mask, show your ID, not your boarding pass, and when they have your information on screen, they ask that you pull down your mask so they can make sure it is you.

For Southwest, there is a watering station to fill up your bottle on the left. To the right is a Peets, Chick-fil-A, and further down, a Starbucks,  a Hudson News (where I got a turkey sandwich and some chips for our meal) and a sushi restaurant.  The Chick-fil-A was open by 7am and the line was long.

The lounge area was clean. And since the plane isn't full, it wasn't as crowded to line up for the plane.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyz-q7qceT5xF11J94G7s6J3glXdzEKSwCufh_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0KVKCi8a2Tre9pTD5nevP1mWxQQ_fMs_sLAd_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvcoJyqtJfhh_Oe2q1I9OME7ZfKWk0sY8lOhDf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Time>

<text>Typical airport. Just know that nothing is open early in the morning, so if your flight is before 7 bring your own food. A bunch of the water bottle refill spots are boarded up, but the ones way down on the end weren't the last time I was there.<//text><name>elskipador< /name>< user_id>

Beautiful day to fly. Airport is clean and organized. Arrived in the A.M. and virtually no lines, flying international, at the check-in counter or passing the TSA inspection. Workers are helpful and friendly with any questions or when letting you know what you need to do. Love living close and flying out of this airport.<//Text>

Clean, not as busy as the past. Many establishments still no open. The challenges of traveling during Covid-19 times! Why only 3 stars...
Went to one of the two places where you can actually get a drink...was told, must purchase a food item in order to purchase a alcoholic beverage. Huh? If this were the Mexican place at the other end, maybe ok. But, this place had chips and sandwiches in packages...they said it required food purchase was the law! Seriously!
Over $20 for a double of Jack on the rocks...wow, that'll make ya wanna give up drinking!
Especially, at the airport!
Safe travels!!< /Text>

Easy and convenient but restaurants really need to reopen. Only two, very understaffed places are open, even in the orange tier. They are losing money as people are traveling again.</Review>

Super fast checking with Hawaiian, TSA was easy and straightforward. The gates were super close and could walk through the entire gate area within minutes. Just know that all carriers, except for Delta are in a Terminal far from the parking and you need to shuttle.< /text>

San Jose's airport is a great option if you're in the bay area. It's a little out of the way if you're heading to San Francisco or Oakland, but it is a lot less hectic and the terminal is in great shape.

I'm just traveling through, but I did have to get my bags from baggage claim and I will need to check them back in tomorrow morning (no connecting flight this evening.

Baggage claim consists of just two carousels so it's not too difficult to find which one is spewing forth luggage from your flight.

Check in is on the same level. Most of the food , drink, etc. vendors are in the terminal area that is past security, but there is a Starbucks and a little "marketplace" available by baggage claim if you need something when you're getting your bags.

Not sure about parking, but there appears to be a huge garage structure right across the street.

There is a sign for a USO, but all I could find was the Military Lounge, which is not a USO and is only for active duty military personnel. It's something the airport does for the military and is a nice thing.< /Review>

Greatest airport ever. A lot smaller and less busy than SFO. TSA lines are non-existent and the gates are right after security. It takes about 10 minutes to walk in, get through security including unpacking my bags and taking my clothes off, redressing and repacking carry-ons, and walking to the gate. This is the speed and efficiency I wish I always had at airports! I love flying in and out of SJC when I need to go to the bay area! Except on Sundays because Chick-fil-A is closed 😏</text>

<Review>Back in the day... That is before Corona virus took over... When I had to do a lot of day trip traveling down to southern California, this airport was ideal. I could park in a parking lot that was literally butted up against the terminal and I could go from my car to the TSA line in under 3 minutes. Getting in and out was a fair breeze. The interior of the terminal could use some work geometrically I mean. It's one long line of gates on one side and shops on the other. Which means you might have to walk 20 gates to get to your favorite Starbucks or restaurant. All in all though, pretty good airport.</Review><pics>None<//pics><rate>4<//rate>< date>

Very clean. Easy to get around. Not very many cell outlets in baggage areas to charge cell. Several people were sleeping on the chairs in baggage area, I counted 4 men total  sound asleep laying down sprawled on 2 or 3 chairs...other than that. It was pretty good!< /Review>

Not many people at the airport which is surprising, but pretty confusing if your not familiar with this airport. I personally prefer SFO because it's easier n 95% less expensive when booking flights leaving the state or the country compared to the cost of other local airports.< /review>

<Text>Despite the wait due to Covid-19, the experience remained very good. I only came to rent a car... THIS TIME, though as compared to my past rentals and airport experiences, this one was very pleasant. The customer service agent at Avis/Budget was wonderful. With her 30 years of experience, she made things smooth despite the issues both the Bay Area and the World are experiencing.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>This airport functions well. There is nothing fancy about this airport however they do have some bakery, coffee shops, Newspaper shop and Inmotion Entertainment. If you catch Delta Flights then you can park your car and come straight into the terminal which is very convenient. They do have charging spots under their seats which I haven't seen at many airports.<//text><name>RT< /name><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKRKvRCBiIAd1CwP3lCMHsvk-CQpVHJ5ztWRPU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-Xc2yWSd4BZ_EghHjPLPwpaKlxTBYE115hMdJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Time>1579387798149</Time><user>108620748962503270300< /user>< gmap_id>

What's great about this place is everything is easy to find. Rentals are easy to get in and out especially with previously booked cars/vans/SUVs/trucks. Also easy to find parking. Highly recommend this airport for air travel.< /Text>

Congrats to the tsa agent who took my spray bottle of rubbing alcohol that was very obviously less than 4 ounces on the grounds that "it's flammable". Not like there's a pandemic or anything going on ya know. And good thing literally none of the alcohol-based sprays they would have allowed are totally not flammable in any way whatsoever. You'd think in silicon valley of all places they could hire some people with an inkling of intelligence.</review>

Nice airport.  Could be a lot of walking to get to gate. Delta,  Alaska,  and Southwest are the major carriers. Good to get away from the San Francisco chaos.
Amazing to me that there are international flights here... even if limited.<//Review>

In our experience, this airport has been infinitely more pleasant than SFO. If there is any way that we can possibly travel via SJC instead of SFO, we do so. Overall, we find SJC cleaner, more convenient and friendlier.

Many of the negative reviews seem to concern the TSA personnel. I think it's important we understand that they are not well compensated and much is asked of them in return, with many passengers not paying them the courtesy they deserve. If we all make an effort to be courteous, we will receive more courtesy in return.

It also speaks well of SJC that negative reviews here are conscientiously responded to, typically with offers to contact appropriate parties, to follow up on issues that deserve attention.

TIP: We ourselves did experience some issues relating to our unfamiliarity with the layout and the parking system. I would highly encourage anyone using this airport for the first time to make an effort to check things out online before their trip -- and always arrive earlier, to allow for possible missteps.

<Text>The up and coming airport for the Silicon Valley business travellers. SFO is a little too far, and Oakland is on the east bay, and SJC is right in the heart of Silicon Valley. The airport just need to live up to its expectations by being able to digest through all the travellers and accommodate real international passengers with enough customs officer. The terminals right now are big jokes and the overwhelming traffic is simply too much for the airport to handle.
This airport needs the right direction and vision to make it a real player in the aviation world for Silicon Valley< /Text>< Pics>

It's a fully support and equipped international airport in San Jose.  What else to say? More convenient to Santa Clara County residents than SFO.</Review>

Congrats to the tsa agent who took my spray bottle of rubbing alcohol that was very obviously less than 4 ounces on the grounds that "it's flammable". Not like there's a pandemic or anything going on ya know. And good thing literally none of the alcohol-based sprays they would have allowed are totally not flammable in any way whatsoever. You'd think in silicon valley of all places they could hire some people with an inkling of intelligence.<//Review>

<Review>Not so crowd, A nice, clean, middle sized airport with international flights. Parking lots 4,5 full, less choices on restaurants.

This is my hometown airport. I've been here many times, but it's never a familiar place. Which terminal is A,  which one is B? I can't remember. So I always end up in the wrong lane.<//Review>

Easy to get in and out of.  The place to fly into for the south part of the Bay, and it's not the dump that it was ten years ago.  Has most of the comforts, amenities and free space of many of the larger airports and definitely worth flying into rather than SFO.  Forty minutes to or from the Fremont area with rush hour traffic.<//Review>

Very tidy! Surprising because in such a small airport, there were so many food options to choose from.  Security is quick and fast, plus the new terminal looks excellent! No complaints at all here.<//text>

Love flying out of this airport it's super easy to get around, though it's a little busy at times and people cant seem to drive around the airport or follow rules, no fault of the airport. I like flying out of Alaska airlines. #alaskaairlines</Text>

<Review>Cute little airport. If you're going to Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, Mountain View etc.) on a domestic flight, flights to this airport is usually slightly cheaper. There's a train going all the way to San Francisco, too. Despite so close to the center of tech, things move rather slowly here. They need people from the valley to bring some disruption to this airport.< /Review>< time>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>It's all about the gates - and in this case, the gate structure is pretty good. Plenty of security lanes, efficient TSAPre, and the traffic through the gates tends to be low enough that you usually get through in 5.minutes or less (way less, with TSAPre).

Inside, there really isn't much in the way of amenities - just the usual assortments of Peets, Starbucks, chain restaurants, etc.

That's ok though - the key here is to come in hot (get here with just enough time to make it through the gates, and onto the plane 😀<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEBt3HLlW5of7LTUWOYMdCu7GSouiELT0Om1_H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqHY8yjWlmt06CWCsU06gXmZ5JeWaF0wkfuk5V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsofE2wuYUjloC2QNOlqObjK3ygIzdrVCRoWBf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpP9aXLa15b5cnBT18JS-O5xZ_GzNJZ8uxPt_T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fcbc3fab3c59b:0xbcfa443f6df67e3e<//gmapID></record>

One of the better airports. Not too big, not too small. Easy to get where you are going.</text>

A small airport may need to line up for a while. I am a bit confused when I am standing at the exit sign. The shuttle bus to the car rental center(6) is actually at 2 o'clock, similar to the bus stop.</Review>

SJC is a super simple design, I mean the whole thing is one straight line. The new terminal B, used to house primarily Southwest flights (pre-covid) is a little boring, and a ways away from the food options. I've never had long lines, bad service, or huge delays at SJC and I have flown to and from here probably 10+ times now since becoming a student at SJSU. They also make the pick ups for uber and lyft really easy with the designated waiting areas. Overall I <3 SJC!</Text>

<review>This is one of my favorite airports. It's easy to get in and out of, very clean and TSA is efficient. I've never had any issues. In the past, I've shown up an hour or so before my flight's boarding time and still had plenty of time to relax, grab some water etc. There's a cool coffee bot at the very end of the Southwest terminal that I hope to see again.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pics>

Nice airport.  Could be a lot of walking to get to gate. Delta,  Alaska,  and Southwest are the major carriers. Good to get away from the San Francisco chaos.
Amazing to me that there are international flights here... even if limited.< /text>

Awful. No restaurants were open. No dine in, no where to relax and maybe have beer before a long flight. Ill fly into and out of a different airport next time. Never had this issue and I've been flying into San Jose for some years now.</Text>

There are many areas to talk about when it comes to an airport. From the design to the operations, and to the amenities within. So instead of bore you with the details, here are a few useful bullets.
- Small airport, but everything is reachable within a small distance.
- Connected terminals so accessing different amenities are possible.
- Fast Internet (most of the time).
- Very decent lounges if you have access. (occasional restrictions).
- Lower flight cadence when compared to bigger airports like SFO.
- Less airline options when compared to bigger airports like SFO.</Text>

Very busy airport. I cannot speak for the other airlines since I have only flown southwest but I cannot say enough about the absoulty awesome employees they have. The airport helps people with special needs and or the elderly. They are friendly and just awesome! They physically helped me with my special needs granddaughter to our gate and literally stayed with us until our plane left. From going g to the gate to going through security they were extremely helpful! I cannot say enough about San Jose Airport!</Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>As far as airports go, this was one of the best experiences I've ever had. I wish going through an airport was always this good.

Leave it up to Silicon Valley to have such a sleek, modern, and sexy  airport as this. It is not large, which makes drop off and finding your gate quite easy. There is not a frantic feel here. Laid out well, everything is easy to find, and it is spotless clean.

Nice lounge for a drink with a nice view too. Flight was on time and done!<//Review></record>

A personal item was taken from my checked luggage on September 24th at Terminal A United Airlines. Neither the airport or TSA will assist me with this. Traveler beware!< /Review>

The rental car bus is the only downside to flying in and out of here. There can be some long waits, there is one bus for all the rental cars.
Plenty of shops to get something to eat and drink. TSA precheck line was short, getting through security was fast.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOjYOn6BNEK4MbP2HRkoeQ9cAkSNaLEY6sVUCD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPrcXJwH1R5LYhAb4f1Neqqk_s7tggqDrkPWsX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuYafDRODr1Nala5Bjx2slWaB4wmwgGelaexkx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

This airport is nice. We've been using it instead of San Francisco,  so we don't have to hassle with that traffic. The only hard part was figuring out where to park. For Terminal B, the closest lots are 3 and 5. The Starbucks line at baggage claim is super slow.<//Review>

I've had a couple of long-term projects in the Bay Area, and my airport of choice is SJC.  San Francisco may have better dining and shopping, but SJC is 100% better at being on-time with their core business of airplanes landing and taking off.  Served by the major airlines, and a huge Southwest hub, if you fly Southwest, there are nearly as many tickets to SJC as to the larger SFO.  Plus, the terminal is super-easy to navigate -- it's just one long concourse -- you can walk inside security from the end of Terminal A, all the way through Terminal B.  Plus, the rental car center is just across the road from Terminal B.  Consistently, I'm able to return my rental car, walk across the road, get through Terminal B security (Pre Check), and walk the length of the airport to my flight in Terminal A...all in far less than a half-hour.<//Text>

The staff here are very friendly and were extremely helpful with the confusion we had. Whoever thought of lollipops at the front desks are a genius. It's the small warm touches that make stressful situations better. Security was also very cheerful. We're thinking of switching to using this airport on a regular basis and making an extra stop instead of a direct flight because the experience here is extremely pleasant.</text>

<Text>A small, efficient, and convenient airport. We had no problem getting an Uber to downtown San Francisco when our SFO plane was diverted here. The walk from the gate to baggage claim was surprisingly long for a smaller airport, but it felt good after sitting on the plane for a while. There seem to be a nice selection of restaurants and vendors as well.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I travel A LOT.  A layover at SJC is a bummer.  Tons of customers, but very few restaurants open, and today, not one that served any alcohol.  I've got to remember, to avoid any layovers here.  It jusr doesn't make sense, when every other airport can do it.<//review>

< Review>
TSA is inept at this airport. Be prepared to be shuffled from one security line to another, extensive and slow scrutiny of your every item regardless of being TSA approved, complete pat down after scan. Agents cluster together and will not handle a screen independently. We have flown this airport multiple times.< /Review>

Perfectly clean and great staff always smiling and helping us get to where we needed to go.   Easy to navigate and situated extremely close to all your favourite Northern California cities.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Seriously best airport ever! Small, structured in a straight line. Terminal 1 is dedicated to major airlines. There is never any lines at security. Gates are never too far.

The best part it is hardly ever rains and no fog. You can always land and take off.

There are international routes to Asia and Europe.

< Review>
Everything works very fast here. All gates are closeby to the baggage claim. The bags usually arrive before you arrive. The rideshare pickup is also just across the street. I love the fact that they have a cell phone area where you can wait for your passengers call, just a minute away from the airport. The security lines are sometimes long, but not always. Would be good to have more places to eat inside the airport.</Review>

<Review>Good airport.
Little bit small but very convenient if you are flying from San Jose or nearby area.
All nearby people uses this for domestic travel.
Not much long haul flights, but you can get connecting international flights, which'll be ok if you are ok to add 1 more stop in your route.
Not much restaurants as this is still not big airport.
My company is in San Jose and they routes international flights also via this airport as this is convenient for everyone.< /Review><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fcbc3fab3c59b:0xbcfa443f6df67e3e< /gmapID>< user_id>

< review>
It's all about the gates - and in this case, the gate structure is pretty good. Plenty of security lanes, efficient TSAPre, and the traffic through the gates tends to be low enough that you usually get through in 5.minutes or less (way less, with TSAPre).

Inside, there really isn't much in the way of amenities - just the usual assortments of Peets, Starbucks, chain restaurants, etc.

That's ok though - the key here is to come in hot (get here with just enough time to make it through the gates, and onto the plane 😀< /review>

I have never missed a flight. This how it was we got there with my mom then we went to the check in the person was very nice to us. Then we walked up stairs to the security where kids under 12 can just walk through the metal detector but for me I just walked through were the security walk then when we are finished we walk to our gate and our plane always arrive on time I like to watch it come. Southwest is very good they let 2 bags free and also let the family with kids go first then we would go in which is fun.</review>

Flew in on a Sunday afternoon, breeze to walk out and get to DoubleTree shuttle, which was outside waiting to pick up guest.
Flew out on Monday evening. Even with airport being a bit busy. Security was very effecient and effective at get you scanned and searched.<//text>

Nice airport, clean. The reason for one star is how some of the employees that work there are very rude, no class nor manners in how they talk to customers. If your not happy working there and give attitude to people, who by the way didn’t give you a hard time nor attitude, than maybe it’s time for you to find another job. Employees need more training on Customer service!</Text>

<Review>The rating is for the experience with the customs check at the international terminal more than of the airport. The customs officer tore apart the zipper on two of the suit cases when he couldn't open it with ease. He didn't have patience to deal with my in-laws who don't speak English well enough. This is when there were no one else in the queue behind my in-laws.

The international arrivals terminal is still under the construction. We had to wait for an hour outside the gate with no seating available. Not a great experience.< /Review></record>

It's an airport. It's not large. Sometimes security is long. I appreciate the different airlines that service the airport.< /Text>< pictures>

A small airport may need to line up for a while. I am a bit confused when I am standing at the exit sign. The shuttle bus to the car rental center(6) is actually at 2 o'clock, similar to the bus stop.<//text>

They sell all the usual food and drink at this airport but don't include anything like a table  near the seats.  Odd choice for a carpeted area with lots of   empty space.</text>

<Review>So far I had decent experience but it is small airport when compared to other airports. Try to be there at-least couple of hours before the boarding time. So that crowd can be avoided.

<Text>Medium size airport in the U.S. I had a chance transferring flight in SJC Airport.
The experience was quite good!

SJC has 2 Terminals, A and B. The B Terminal has some international flights.
The airport has all necessary amenities. Food options are wide. They even has a Chick Fil A in the Terminal B.

Will definitely explore the city next time flying through San Jose, California.< /Text><rate>4</rate></record>

<text>The staff here is rude and NOT traveller friendly. We were late for our flight and instead of accommodating and putting us through priority line (which happens at most airports), the staff kept reminding us that we were late.
The staff at xray machines is old, wears glasses and busy in gossips adding to delays at xray machines.
Will prefer SFO anytime.< /text>< username>

this is for a lost and found experience. Lost an item and someone returned it to the gate agent. Another gate agent verified my item was there. Went to go pick it up and all of a sudden they can’t find it. Cleaners/ gate agents are either taking people stuff home thinking they are never going to claim it or they are just careless with other people’s belongings and do not follow proper procedures when it comes to lost and found items. Disappointed in humanity.<//Text>

A really good time waster. After a 12 hour flight which was itself delayed by an hour. We arrived at the San Jose airport and the computers for customs and border protection were down. Completely exhausted from the flight, everywhere had to wait an  hour in a narrow hallway while they fixed them. Horrible and old system, San Francisco has a more modern and faster system for getting people through.</text>

<review>In my rush to pack and get to the airport for my international flight, I neglected to take photos of luggage contents! Upon arrival at my destination, items were clearly missing. Upon contacting the appropriate airline reps., they refused to use the word, "theft" only "Lost & Found"---Moreover---the airlines are not responsible for "Lost & Found"😮 Good grief! They sounded real but rehearsed!!! Translation: Too bad for the customer! Moreover, I was unsuccessful in getting documents mailed (registered or certified). The staff preference was meeting me at Baggage Claim (after a transpacific flight). Ugh!

Eventually, I found the missing items and took time to notify the appropriate personnel. They were very gracious, however. Suggestion: photograph the luggage content prior to departure! It may/can remedy a lot of conjecture!</review>< rating>

It is one of my favorite airports to fly from and to. Always fast. Lanes aren't long, and if so, they manage to go through very quickly.
They have a very good organized and clean shops and foodcour. The prices aren't any higher than restaurants out in the city.
I have found the cheapest flights at this airport. The personnel has treated me well and courteous all the times I have flown from this airport.</Text>

I like this airport.  It's comfortable, familiar and not hectic whatsoever.  I've never had any issues with security they keep it running smooth.  Plenty of quick and light or more hearty food, surprising for this relatively small airport. when traveling I appreciate having a good assortment of options.< /review>

Lots of money spent, but...

I first flew out of the old terminal at the South end on a turbo prop long thin plane with tight 1-1 or 2-2 seating. 1950s flying to LA to see GPs. The Attendant could barely walk down the aisle not being a midget.

In the 80s the East side southern white terminal had very long walks. That bldg is now replaced. We "lost" several 70# boxes of Alaska sockeye salmon and huge halibut we caught flying back from Yakutat, Anchorage, and SeaTac on the same fumbling unfriendly airline; we applied for a check for full retail at famous sj fish store and finally got it. Same "award" unmentionable airline told us bear spray in our checked bags for 30yd Griz on Situk River was "ok" 3 times, then confiscated $35 REI big canister and holster at the gate!

A couple years ago I flew out of the East side northern terminal, parking in the too small new garage. The airline to Hawaii at the end of the terminal told me to be there "2 and 1/2 hours before the flight" which I did. 3 years in a row. The gate agents weren't there yet for another hour! There is/was totally inadequate seating, telling me it was "designed" to make us stand and wait, with luggage.  Went outside!, It was much faster to check my bag at the curb than the counter. I was sent to the "fast security line" but directed into the long slow security line by a low skill guard. Lots of low skill workers. Only 1 restaurant had a tasty breakfast. On the drab white walls 5hr flight the attendants mostly hid in the back galley and kept us in our seats with bumpy air the whole 5hr flight! When I came back the pick up curb on the other side is too short and too crowded, by design.

And so it goes, stumbling and fumbling, at SJC.

Jan.2020,,,
Flying Southwest to Maui.
Checked 2 duffels at curb counter.
Very dirty, nut shells on counter!
Agent said Airport was Suppose to clean, but did not.
Tried to call SJC "customer service" but no answer.
Phone tree to "Admin. Offices" is too long and they didn't want to hear about it, "call Customer Service"!
Typical low performance standards.< /review>

<review>This is really a 2.5 star review, rounded up.

Having an airport in San Jose is convenient and all, but I'm disappointed at how dated and badly upkept parts of the airport is. Terminal A is run down, in places dirty, and the men's bathroom was reeking of urination.

San Jose, do better.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>This is a much improved airport since the days of the old Terminal C and its non-existent jetways.  Now with Terminals A and the new B, it feels more like a cohesive and modern airport.  There are a good selection of amenities and restaurants here while waiting for your flight.  The roads that approach/exit the terminals and parking lots are clearly marked and traffic flows fairly well.  The only nit I have of Terminal B is the lack of moving walkways.  It seems I always arrive at one end of the terminal and the exit is at the other end.</Text>< Rating>

The new part of the airport is absolutely poorly designed, ugly, small, people don’t have room to pass by or seat. There is only one restaurant/beer place packed with people. Not enough restrooms and long line outside of the restrooms. In case of emergency, I don’t think there is enough room for people to run. Waiting at the gate I felt like I was in a 3rd world country airport. This is silicone valley, they could have done a lot better to have the same airy feel like the other side of the airport.< /Review>

I prefer to fly from here.  SJC is not huge or intimidating; it's convenient and I have not had any issues or delays in my few visits. Security seems to run smooth and the lines move at a fair to good pace. I appreciate that Starbucks is on your way through the doors. One thing that is helpful to learn: when you park your vehicle you will be paying via a machine in the garage (not an attendant/booth)<//Text>

This is a great little airport saves a lot of time instead of flying to SFO but the bathrooms are an insult to the human condition.  Yes, they are that bad it's like someone dropped an Altoid in an outhouse and then that outhouse was dropped in a flowing river of human waste; then someone started a fire.  I've been going to this airport for 6 years and the situation has always been this bad.  It really makes you ask, have we truly evolved?  Please for the love of all that is holy do something about the bathrooms.< /Text>

<username>Paulina Lei</username><Review>San Jose airport is not bad. Overall, it is a well-organized airport. Check-ins are usually fast. During popular times of travel, it can be a little busy, but it's a lot better than other airports in terms of handling the large amount of traffic.

The structural design of the airport is a little flawed. If you have a gate that is a small number like 1-9, you have to walk the entire length of the airport to get to your gate. But, can't really complain about this since this is the design.

Most of the time, it is rather clean. However, I have been there a few times and looked under the seats and found some trash.

Restaurants there are quite nice, too. Of course, the airport prices aren't cheap.<//Review></record>

I've only flown in and out of this airport once..and I am a fan..

The airport is big enough so there's plenty of room for numerous gates for enough flights in and out of San Jose.  However, it's not so big where gates are separated by buildings and you have to get there by a railed tram or long walks.  The tall glass ceilings allow light to naturally come in and make for an attractive airport.

There's pretty good dining options lined up at Mineta should you need to grab a bite.  The TSA Pre-check line is efficient and gets you through quickly.  They had two Pre-check stations operating when I went through at 7 PM.  There's a cool rotating airplane influenced art piece right outside the security check.  It's a social media moment for sure.

This is the best airport to rent a car from.  The rental car area is literally across the street.  After less than a 10 minute walk, you're in the rental car building lobby.  Fantastic.

Overall, Mineta San Jose Airport is a well designed medium sized airport.  I don't fly here often, but I would have no issues flying to Mineta when need be.  Safe Travels!</text>

<Text>There is no working wifi in this airport.
Long lines of gates(southwest terminal)
No restaurants what so ever.
Flights always get delayed.

The only pro I see is it's a tech place and you see a lot of tech shops selling tech stuff.

This airport can learn a lot from pdx.</Text>< date>

< Review>
This is a great little airport saves a lot of time instead of flying to SFO but the bathrooms are an insult to the human condition.  Yes, they are that bad it's like someone dropped an Altoid in an outhouse and then that outhouse was dropped in a flowing river of human waste; then someone started a fire.  I've been going to this airport for 6 years and the situation has always been this bad.  It really makes you ask, have we truly evolved?  Please for the love of all that is holy do something about the bathrooms.</Review>

<Review>Easy access into airport, and fairly easy rental car pick up / return process. Check in and TSA checkpoint weren’t a problem, and there appears to be plenty of food and drink options inside the secured part of the terminal.<//Review>< Date>

This airport does its job and it does it well. It's much easier and less stressful to navigate than SFO. There are ample food options past security. From arriving at the airport to reaching the gate must have taken around 25-30 minutes max on a lazy Thursday morning.

The only somewhat annoying thing about SJC is that it's not particularly easy to get to from the rest of the Bay Area via public transit - you have to take the Caltrain to San Jose Diridon station and then either take a city bus or take the VTA light rail - not bad, but not great either. But if you are ok with either struggling through public transit or taking an Uber/taxi, then this may just be the best airport in the Bay area.<//Text>

<review>Access to this airport is pretty simple from major freeways (101, 87, 17/880). Plenty of short/long term parking. While other airport options exist nearby (SF, Oakland, Monterey) I prefer SJC.
- I predominately travel using American Airlines who has an Admirals Club here and reasonable flight schedule options (although it was better years ago when  SJC was an American hub location). Inside the secured area (where the Gates are, thru TSA) there are plenty of small shops, places for food, both a Peets and $tarBucks coffee, book stores and restrooms.
- I've never had an issue where arriving at least 3 hours before your flight was required (although I did get burned once on a codeshare American flight serviced by Alaskan Airlines who refused me a boarding pass because their self-serve machines were down and waiting in line I got to their ticket counter only 40 minutes before flight time, so I had to schlep my bags back over to the Ametican terminal where they confirmed that if it had been at an American Gate that they would have issued me a boarding pass as long as the Jetbridge door for that flight was still open (and they apologized for their "partner's" overly aggressive rule). American then re-routed my itinerary for free putting me on different/alternate American flights (ones that would have been more expensive if I had booked them) that got me where I was going on-time and gave me upgraded preferred seats - again for free, AND they were done BEFORE my original flight departed (in other words in less than what was left of those 40 minutes even including the inter-terminal foot travel excursion).
- Bottomline is ANYtime there has been any unplanned travel complication (like, equipment/weather canceled flights) American has always taken care of me (arranging ground transportation to a nearby quality hotel, providing dinner vouchers, re-booking onto first thing next morning direct flight to my original location in upgraded seating - all at $0 to me). SJC continues to be my preferred home base.<//review>< Name>

<Text>Going out on British Airways to LHR was a breeze. Security had almost no line, and Terminal B had cool artwork to check out. At Terminal B gates the seats have power outlets so no need to sit on the floor next to an outlet. The only issue was on our return flight. BA had cancelled all the flights before ours for around a week. The flight was PACKED. Customs is easy, especially when your flight is the only one arriving. Overall pretty nice experience</Text>< username>

This meant my mother had to be pushed on her walker through bone chilling winds last night to the place where uber drivers are allowed to pick up their passengers. She fell sick after this exposure to the cold. This after one uber driver canceled after being told we would have to pick up my mother from the terminal. So we had to push her from the terminal to the island. We were not to know that our second uber driver would be so compassionate. Before mom turned up there he offered that I could sit in the car and we could go pick her up.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fcbc3fab3c59b:0xbcfa443f6df67e3e<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It is large and busy but the airlines are very willing to help had a wheelchair to take me to gate, the food inside of course is very expensive however just to lay over for another flight or the land here as your destination great Airport lots of information on motels hotels places to eat I would say it's quite good for an International Airport<//text>

<text>The facilities are modern with bathrooms spaced evenly along the concourse. Good variety of restaurants. However, due to airport real estate, the terminal is very linear. That is, all the gates are spread out in a line. The parking, car rental, arrivals and departures for domestic flights are all located across from gate 26. If you land at gate 17 or lower number, you have to walk quite a distance to get to the exit.

There is only one security checkpoint in Terminal B.  Clear, TSA Pre check, and general have separate lines, but all are still funneled through the one area (maybe 5 x-ray lines total of all are open, one or two dedicated to Clear/TSA Pre). This wait can be long for security, depending on the day/time. Note: I have not been in Terminal A (international).< /text></record></dataset><record>

Claustrophobic airport, very narrow to navigate. Food selection was horrendous. We flew in about 7:30pm and one restaurant was sold out of food and closed 3 hours early, one was sold out of anything good, one was sold out of salads and had nearly no stock in their fridge and a fourth had no kitchen because of a mandatory union break for their chef, who they had no one to backfill him with. We ended up at the pizza place and their staff had not restocked basic things like parmesan cheese and the garbage was overflowing so heavily they had run out of plates and had to ask a patron to change seats so they could empty the garbage. Overall not impressed with this airport and will make a conscious effort to not fly back through here.</review>

TSA was horrible there. Ive been flying with the same tool in my bag for 10 years but they confiscated it. Straight robbery. I fly a lot so if i have extra time I opt out to avoid unnecessary radiation and they treated me so poorly because of that and the process took unnecessarily long.</Text>

At Frontier Airlines, they suck. Waiting in line to check luggage for almost an hour. Already less than 2 hours before the flight to Denver departs. There is no one from Frontier Airlines staff at the check in booth or information as to when the booths will be open to accept luggage. The line is becoming very long and people are becoming restless.
I am going to use another airline, like SouthWest, instead of Frontier next time.</text>

The staff of Delta airlines was unwelcoming. The security at the security check act like a bunch of high school teenagers, giggling unnecessarily. A little professionalism would go a long way, which is highly necessary for their department.</Text>

It forces you to pay $7 for a box of tampons. Being a woman you aren’t given any option other than to hand over money simply for being a a woman with a reproductive system. I hope that they reconsider and make the airport bathrooms accessible to all people and not use a woman’s period as a way to get money.<//Review>< Response>

<rate>1</rate><Text>They cannot tend to their customers properly. My luggage was delayed back in Chicago and they said it would be on the next flight to San Jose. Great, no problem. They told me they WILL deliver my luggage TONIGHT. But they ended up never making the arrangements to have it delivered to me, while having important items in that bag that was needed. Would NOT trust customer service or anyone you speak to as they can't even do their jobs.
Will never reccomend people flying out of there.< /Text>< Time>

<Text>I love flying in an out of SJC. There is rarely any lines at security to the point where it's faster to go in the regular line than the pre-check line. Because it's still relatively small geographically speaking, you can get from curbside to the gate in less than 20 minutes if you aren't checking a bag. The lines to check bags are also practically non-existent across multiple airlines (american, United, JetBlue, etc), so even if you have to go that route, it won't add too much time. There aren't many food options inside or outside of security so I'd recommend eating before you arrive. However they have a few decent bars so come thirsty.<//Text>< Date>

This airport was awful. How can an airport in one of the largest cities in the US be this bad? All employees that I came in contact with were either unhelpful or down right rude. An entire section of this airport didn’t have AC and did not offer nearly enough food options for all the patrons. I waited in a long (very slow) line to purchase three pre-made sandwiches, two bottles of water and a Coke that cost me $50!!!! What on earth?! Another lady purchased something they no longer had. They told her AFTER she payed and made her wait for a while, to then tell her that they didn’t have it. She asked for a refund and the ONE cashier told her it would be at least 30 minutes because she said “I don’t know how to do it, can’t you just get the chicken?”<//text>

Small. No 1st class check-in line. Priority check-in had 1 person at counter and a line of 5 when we got there. They want you to use the kiosks and bag drop instead.

No recharge stations we could find in domestic terminal. Very few places to plug something in.

No AA or United Club. The Club is a for profit club that wont honor your club memberships. They appear to cater to foreigners flying foreign flag airlines. That and Priority Pass/Diners Club. That's a joke. So prepare to sit at the gate or spend money.

Very limited shopping or dining options.

Unless you hate SFO you are much better off using it.</review>

Clean airport with many outlets, bathrooms (including single person all gender rooms), and water fountains  (including water bottle stations). There are charging stations and work desks at many gates for different airlines. A variety of stores and restaurants are available. Decorations are put up according to holiday season. Many advertisements are for robots, cybersecurity and other assorted technology. Security line can be very long, sometimes 45 min or longer, in the morning after long weekends so get to airport early.< /text>

I watched a guy have a seizure and the police stood around doing nothing while the medics took more than ten minutes to arrive. 0/10 would not have a life-threatening emergency at this airport.

Edit: after fifteen minutes, the paramedics strolled up in no hurry at all. Glad he got the help he needed but for the love of God don't count on San Jose Police, fire, or paramedics to respond in any sort of hurry.< /Text>

The police officer there, an Asian fellow, was absolutely rude to me. He approached me randomly, or maybe because I'm black, about ticketing without asking others. In other words, he picked me, the only colored person in the area to interrogate. It was absolutely racist and he was wholeheartedly rude during this interrogation process. So this is where my tax money is going to? To my own exploitation. That guy needs serious evaluation on life and as a cop. Never had such a rude experience with a cop before and it just ruined my experience of the airport as a whole. I mean how would you feel? Please get that guy out of that otherwise nice little airport. He has a lot to learn. I will not be using this airport if I receive similar treatment again.Theres always San Fran airport.</text>

I'm not much of a flyer, but the SJC made things much more pleasant.  Arrived in a downpour and was promptly picked up by a very nice shuttle driver.  She saw me drive in and then looked for me to give me a ride.  The airport is the perfect size.  Easy to navigate outside and in the terminal.  Thank you!<//review>

I travel about 100 segments a year and SJC is one of the most confusing. Landed in terminal A and luggage was in B. Signage is horrible. No one to help with directions. There were two other men and a family of 4 confused as well. Finally found the bus to terminal B.  Landed at 8:15 and took me 60 minutes to finally get to the shuttle pick-up. I will avoid SJC in the future.</Text>

Love this airport. Getting more hi-tech by the hour. It is pretty cool to see the San Jose Airport change and I mean in a good way oh, some of the stuff is silly like a high-tech robot that really doesn't do anything, but a lot of it is quite amazing and you could go take a look at all the stores.< /review>

One of the best features of this airport is that almost all seating areas feature USB charges in each seat. The airport is well organized and even though it's rather small it doesn't feel too crowded. Line at security is usually not too bad and they try hard to get people through quickly. Restaurant options are limited but after all you're here to travel and not to dine. Overall, the airport could need an update though.</text>

Easy airport to navigate, but they desperately need better restaurant options.   I would expect much better for a bay area airport.  Also, getting to the rental car place was a bit ridiculous.  You feel like you're driving in circles just to get to the rental car ramp, then you drive in more circles going up multiple floors of the garage to get to the actual agency.  Mine, of course, was on the top (7th) floor (Dollar Rental).< /text>

< Review>
We flew through Terminal B recently and found security to be a fast.
The seats having electrical ports were great & airport wifi was really efficient. I found the bathrooms to be (clean) but small. Maybe they’ll be expanded in the future.  We’ll definitely be back.< /Review>

SJC may not seem like the fanciest, most accommodating-to-all (or whatever) airport - but it gets it right in core areas. Personally, even living in SF I prefer flying out of this airport. Always ease of access (depart/arrival lanes) and security is very efficient. Rarely wait in long lines or for very long through security, while the process seemed to remain very effective. Always make my flight, easily get home without long baggage claim waits. Lots of stores fulfilling a surprising number of needs inside and easily found without twists or turns or shuttles. Often times I will step out from security and be nearby my gate within just a few minutes. Seems to me this stuff is really what matters in an airport.<//text>

<text>This is the worst far airport I been to so far. First time they lost my baggage. Had to come back next day to get them. And 2nd time the check-in staff leaves early before their scheduled time because of which I miss my flight. There is no customer service at all, all the staff members are so rude. Will never go back. The worst place.< /text><UserId.>110489374104538551284</UserId.><time>1537393512655<//time><user_name>Thecoolguy5.4</user_name><Rating>1<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

Well maintained airport with decent restaurants and coffee shops, short lines (for the most part), and convenient location. The consolidated rental car center across from terminal B is awesome. I've never had issues flying out of SJC.</review>

Nice local airport right in the center of Santa Clara county. The airport is quite new as it went through renovation for terminal b and prepare for more international flights. I took one star off because the frequent airplane flying over whole bay area created quite some noise.</text>

<Review>Worst experience ever. If you're coming in from overseas DO NOT fly into this airport. Global Entry and Mobile Passport are worthless here! Connecting flights are being missed and they could careless. Absurd back ups at customs and the agents are taking 10-15 min per person and the wait is literally hours. Nightmare!! Alaska is no better. Telling us it will cost us to re-book and there are no more flights until tomorrow. And this was what Alaska called a direct flight to Seattle. I'd give ZERO stars if I could!<//Review>< pics>

IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON USING SAN JOSE AS AN AIRPORT TO FLY INTO WHEN COMING FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY, I IMPLORE YOU TO THINK AGAIN What an awful experience. I was starving when I got off the plane going from Cabo to SJ, and I had the pleasure of waiting over an hour in a crowded customs line. Unlike other airports that use computers to speed up the process, SJ only offers it for Global Entry, which makes everything take way longer. This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in an airport< /review>

Today at San Jose airport I was chosen for a random TSA search and patdown. I'm a 70 year old grandmother with disabilities and I have had TSA precheck for years. I have severe arthritis and it's very difficult to remove my shoes especially when there is no comfortable seat anywhere and 200 people crowded around me! The TSA agents took my walking cane away from me so I could barely walk or function and had the audacity to tell me I shouldn't travel if I have that much pain! I have never encountered such unbelievable rudeness in my life!
My travels have taken me all over the world and SJC airport is the worst! Do yourself a favor and fly in to SFO airport!< /Text>

Easy to get to and the car rental is just across the street. I like that they have Jamba Juice, interestingly other airports don't have that.
The lines are not long and you can get through the x-ray line pretty fast.< /Text>

This airport is much more convenient that San Francisco International.  It's not a huge airport, and the crowds are never overwhelming.  The airport is very clean.  We typically park off site, and there is a shuttle that comes pretty often for the lot.< /Text>

This airport is tucked away in San Jose and is pretty nice. Due to its location in Silicon Valley there are plenty of tech savey travellers and the bells and whistles to go with them. The loading and unloading zone is fairly busy and could use expansion but other than that everything feels easy going and smooth. The building Is modelled after an airplane hanger and is laid out as a long line with gates laid out along one side. This was wisely done so that travel between terminals is fast. If you have this airport as a choice I would recommend it over many others.< /Text>

<Text>This airport has changed  a lot since the 80s and has newer terminals  (while the original one has closed down).  The airport is very easy to navigate although baggage claim can be far depending on where your flight arrived.  Security is relatively fast.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>I can't believe I'm reviewing an airport but this is one of the nicer airports I've been to. Very modern, clean, light, spacious. I was through security really quickly and there was a nice selection of restaurants and shops. If only every airport was like this!< /text>< rating>

< Review>
Parking lot overcharged me/ripped me off today.  And wasted a ton of my time.    You have to call over in attendant supervisor and the attendant supervisor didn't know how to charge me correctly.  They made me back up and move forward and back up and move forward it was crazy and it took forever and it didn't work the end overcharging me anyway and when instead of leaving, I pointed out I'd been overcharged, they ended up just giving me the difference in cash. The whole thing  was weird and not professional. And I recall there was no apology for any of that. Here's what the site says:

Accessible Parking. All accessible parking spaces are located in Hourly Lot 2 (Terminal A Garage) and Hourly Lot 3 (Rental Car Center Garage). However, those displaying an ADA placard may park in any airport lot at the Econnimy rate of $15.00 per day maximum.

<Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><review>I prefer this airport to SFO since it's a bit less crowded.  Flight are often cheaper from here so its good to compare prices.  I usually fly Southwest from here.

If you're driving from 101 to pick someone up, you can pull to the side of the road right before you enter the airport. Ask whoever you're picking up to give you a call when they are walking out so you can avoid circling around.< /review><GmapID>0x808fcbc3fab3c59b:0xbcfa443f6df67e3e< /GmapID>< user_id>

<text>Absolutely nothing international about this place. Glad by flight was delayed twice because if it wasn't I probably would have missed it because of this airport.

They had one line open with upwards of a hundred people waiting to get through security. After 45 minutes and a slow line I managed to get through. Getting through the metal detectors also took time because they only had two lines open. It was pathetic that it took so long. If I could avoid this airport in the future I will.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>Meh. The airport definitely needs a makeover...especially in Terminal A. All the restaurants are in Terminal B and it kinda sucks to walk all the way over there to eat if leaving from Terminal A. The HVAC systems seem to be struggling too...it was super hot and muggy in the terminal on Tuesday.<//review><Rate>3</Rate>< GmapID>

Holiday weekend. Many mix ups in our travel documents and luggage processing, but the HELP we got was amazing at San Jose Airport. All our helpers were kind, patient, and very accommodating. Honestly, the mistakes we made were not thrown in our face, just professionally handled with care. Made our setbacks seem almost inconsequential. Thank you!!!< /Review>

$5 31 minute chair massage is clutch use of layover time 🙌🏻</Review>
</record>
</dataset><record>
<review>I love the silicon valley airport. Easy in and out.

Parking is abundant.  Lot 1 is closed due to renovations. However, the long term lots near Southwest airline is open and price dropped to $18 per day.

Lot's of restaurants, cocktail, beer and coffee options available in the terminals.

Wait times in lines going through security are very fast, with wait times less than 10 minutes.

A layover of 3+ hours allows me to travel down the street (10 minutes) to grab a bite. I may also travel 15 minutes into downtown to walk or grab a quick bite.

Longer layovers can travel to the Westfield Valley Fair shopping center and to the famous Santana Row - (5 miles) 10 minutes drive or by Uber/Lyft.  Great place to shop, eat and walk for an hour.

Great airport.</review>< resp>

Much quieter than SFO. Have usually sailed right through security but have heard that others have taken quite a while to get through. Love how they have chargers in all the seats. Very comfortable airport.</review>

It's a clean and friendly airport.  The security lines are not long while the wait is way too long for the southwest terminal though.  I can't recall ever seeing all the machines working at the same time and they are just slow here.  I have to get here unusually early to clear the security lines for a simple domestic flight.< /Review>

<name>John H.</name><date>1434727995391< /date><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>In terms of location, it's convenient to really anywhere in the SF/Peninsula/OAK/East Bay/SJ South Bay/Silicon Valley/Santa Cruz. This is partially because most of the time you can get through this airport fairly quickly compared to other airports. The city not investing in a people mover (or two) is utterly ridiculous and does a disservice to the city, Silicon Valley, and everyone who utilizes this supposedly high tech airport. So be prepared (possibly) for long terminal walks (exercise). Food and shopping selections are not great. I agree that the roadways/signage are ridiculous and poorly designed. It's nice that the terminals are new/updated, but there are some negatives (I won't get into with that). Public transportation to the airport is substandard. San Jose should do what Oakland is doing and at the least have an actual Light Rail (if not BART) connector train (spur line such as Ohlone/ Almaden) down Airport Parkway/Brokaw from First Street. First Street is fairly close to the airport, and so I can't imagine it would be that expensive ($120 Million or so?) Public transportation though doesn't generate parking revenue for the city you see. The one reason I like this airport, is that usually, it is low stress and efficient compared to most other airports. So getting from point A to Point B is usually relatively easy and hassle free. 3.5 Stars.<//Review>< Pics>

This is review for British airways 18 gate staff only in San Jose international airport!!! Very unprofessional,  helpless management staff!!! Sayuri ,manager on duty and Jintana Santos, supervisor with limited English language skills !!! Both of them denied put us on the plane on May, 23 to the London without explanation!! They told us we had invalid  tickets!! What was a big lie!!! Both of them just hold us in the gate till plane left. They refused to help us only we later found out our tickets were in fact valid. They even didn't help us to book tickets for next day!!! Not provide compensation for the hotel and meal!!! We will be file compliance to British airways!!! Strongly recommend to San Jose airport hire more professional management staff!!!< /Review>

<review>I truly enjoy flying out of the San Jose airport.  It's definitely a smaller airport, but it makes it more pleasant to travel out of here since things are at a slightly slower pace here.  The only annoying part about this airport is when there are larger groups passing through here, the airport security line becomes very congested.  Aside from that, I'm a fan, and I will continue to fly out of here.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fcbc3fab3c59b:0xbcfa443f6df67e3e</gmapID></record>

Was supposed to be on a plane at 1 to make a birthday party of a close friend the flight is delayed 5 hours and nobody would help us. Alaska airlines was useless and when we went to southwest a women refused to help us yelling at us for being  "in the wrong line" and finally just booked it ourselves I don't recommend this airport just drive the half hour to get to San Francisco airport</text>

Love how small the airport is so that going anywhere is super efficient. There are only two terminals and it's not hard to go from one gate to the other in each of the terminals.

I also love how the Southwest terminal has a great Jamba Juice bar!  I just wish there were more selections for food in each of the locations.

The parking here is also really easy to access as this is a small airport.  One thing to note - sometimes going through security can take a long time.  That's where I would say the biggest wait is!< /text>

If I can I like going through smaller airports. This one is newer, cleaner and easier to navigate than SFO. The baggage pickup is quick and it's a breeze to grab a cab. Note that any cab originating from this airport will start at $15 then increase once you surpass $15 worth of miles/waiting.<//Text>

Despite a very long snake line to check in this morning it went fast. TSA really try to be fast and efficient. Using dogs and have retired bulky trays. My only problem with them that they are sending you to a regular line even though you have a child with TSA PRE on their boarding pass.< /Text>

This is a well-organized and very clean airport. The public transportation system is also good, after a five minute Uber ride away from the main lanes.</Text>

I'm partial to the airport for a variety of reasons, but why fly from any other Bay Area airport? Great redesign and renewal efforts, expanded international service, and a growing network of domestic connections.  Be sure to check out "The Club at SJC" if you have time before your flight.</Review>

A terrible experience. Arriving two hours early at this airport is just enough time to run exhausted to gate 14 right before takeoff. That's two hours to get though baggage and security. Unacceptable.<//text>

It's okay. Not a huge selection of shops or anything, but it's not super busy. The traffic nearby is hot garbage though (I guess this part of California is always like that) so plan accordingly.</Review>

Yea for small airports. I usually can get to my gate quickly and with TSA pre have no problems with the security anymore. TSA pre is worth it and my credit card paid for it.
The most recent flight though, I had to walk from terminal B all the way back to A. This was most annoying and no people movers or anything. It was a good walk but a little frustrating.< /Text>

I have a love-hate relationship with this airport. It, by far, has some of the worst TSA lines. LAX isn't even as bad. BUT it has the best airport bathrooms of any airport I've ever been to. Food selection is good with several sit down restaurants. Terminals are easy to navigate and the traffic is never too bad. If only those TSA lines weren't so awful.  **Note: I've only ever flown out of terminal B!**<//Review>

< Review>
Decent airport in terms of architecture, planning, etc. However, every time I encounter TSA at this airport, I have extra screening for no reason whatsoever. They told me once i was "randomly selected" for a full pat down. My partner also had his pockets checked without being informed beforehand that they were going to touch him. It seems like if the police are not allowed to have such a position of power, how on earth does TSA?

If you are checking for something in particular, because it is the Silicon Valley or something, please inform those in line about what you are intending to do. At least try to be amicable towards passengers...</Review>

<Text>A nice regional airport. Much more relaxed and less hustle bustle than SFO up the bay. It's a fairly long walk typically from the far ends of the terminal to the luggage reclaim. There's a decent amount of shops, security is very fast (early morning in particular / of course) and there's fun little things like the perpetual engine science machine in the lounge to distract from the wait.
Flew with Delta back to Dublin and had no issues. Also good to see water bottle refill points, so no messing with fountains and fighting to angle it juuusst right.
Decent medium sized airport for connecting from International flights.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><user_name>David Khattak< /user_name><Rating>4<//Rating><GmapID>0x808fcbc3fab3c59b:0xbcfa443f6df67e3e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I lost my wallet, somehow drop it on the floor, this morning when I assisted my mom in checking-in her luggage.  One of the staff got hold of my wallet and returned it to me without any missing items.  There are lots of honest people in the world and most of them are in Mineta San Jose International Airport.</text>

<text>This airports sevices are very fast.
That’s great. What this airport lacks is attention to what the patrons need. After being basically stripped by TSA there was no where for me to re-dress. I nearly felt like the Airport was setting me up for my first indecent exposure.
What bugged me more though was all the spilt coffee cups all over the place. Seriously this is an airport not a Ross department store.</text>< Pics>

Departing here on a Sunday morning with Alaska is an amazing experience. No queue to print your bag tag and drop it, and passing security check with TSA Pre took only... 2 mins total?</review>

<Review>It's okay. Not a huge selection of shops or anything, but it's not super busy. The traffic nearby is hot garbage though (I guess this part of California is always like that) so plan accordingly.</Review>< date>

I have a love-hate relationship with this airport. It, by far, has some of the worst TSA lines. LAX isn't even as bad. BUT it has the best airport bathrooms of any airport I've ever been to. Food selection is good with several sit down restaurants. Terminals are easy to navigate and the traffic is never too bad. If only those TSA lines weren't so awful.  **Note: I've only ever flown out of terminal B!**< /Text>

International flight from Mexico.  Through immigration and customs then dumped out the door with NO signage or reader boards to tell where to get our connecting flight. Waited 10 minutes in a hurricane for a shuttle bus to a rental car terminal again no signage. Finally made it to the correct terminal. Wet Cold. Tired. And angry!  Why does the shuttle bus not drop
people off AT the terminal?  Why are international travelers dumped
Out on the sidewalk with no signs providing directions?  We will think twice about flying through this airport again.< /Text>

<Review>Worst. I would have given 0 out of 5 if possible. Not many food options, outside baggage check-in counters closed. Layout is complete straight, need to walk lot. Long lines to order food. Very few seats for so many travelers. Stupid. Bay area is not like USA at all!!!!< /Review>< pictures>

A terrible experience. Arriving two hours early at this airport is just enough time to run exhausted to gate 14 right before takeoff. That's two hours to get though baggage and security. Unacceptable.<//Text>

<Review>Empty airport yet long lines at security.
Long lines at coffee shop because all they have is crappy stores and a single coffee shop at terminal B.

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>San Jose airport is certainly one of my favorites, especially since they reopened the second terminal a couple years back. Flying SouthWest or Alaska is probably the easiest of the bunch and what I usually do, other airlines are less convenient. Only problem I have is the parking prices went up to meet with the larger airports' (i.e. SFO) standards, so if you are going to use long term parking, you're better off going for the out-of-airport parking lot on De La Cruz, for $8 a day with a free shuttle direct to the terminal you can't go wrong.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

This is the center of the digital world.  (Google, Apple and just about every other digital company is nearby.)  Almost every oversized chair is equipped with a power station. Check-out their well designed, easy to use website. Excellent selection of food services. (Many healthy choices, including vegan and gluten-free.) Of course, everything is wheelchair accessible. Lots of easy, expensive parking. Rates range from $18.00 to $30.00 USD daily. Coupons are available on the internet to cut the price in half.  Free, off-site, cell phone parking lot is offered.  Gender-neutral and single-gender bathrooms throughout the facility.  Uber, Lyft and many choices of ground transportation are available. Auto rentals can be slow.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

International immigrations on a weekend (9/30/17) is terrible. Only 4 agents (initially 2) for a hundrends of passengers. With Mobile Passport it took us 45m+ to get through. The arrival hall was still full. Citizen line was moving slowly but non citizen was much worse. It doesn't make sense to get more international travel and direct flights into SJC when a weary traveler's 1st impression is hours of wait to get through customs. You'll be faster flying to SFO and driving down to San Jose. This isn't a one time thing, experienced the same thing last December.<//text>

The rating is really 3.5 stars.

I like the small size of this airport. It's more manageable than SFO. TSA lines are usually not that long.

There is only one lounge, which can be very crowded. I almost found no free seats available. Also, Mobile Passport doesn't work yet for international arrivals. This is a shame, for an airport in the heart of the Silicon Valley.< /text>

Very convenient. Jet Blue flys out to all great destinations out of here. Close to all major highways.
Nice set of restaurants on the airport. Amazing car rental facility, much better than many big airports like San Diego. No shuttle required. Its right across the terminal.
Wish flight operators give best deals (like SFO) flying out of SJC.</text>

Airport is dated, and not high tech. Had higher expectations for my first visit to Silicon Valley. . I was given a paper map by a nice rental car lady who said her computer was so slow, and remarked - is that not funny - for being in the high tech capital of the world:) The ATT data service was so overloaded and I had to pull 3 miles away from airport to get a signal for my GPS app. The people at the Airport were very friendly, and I sure was glad to have the paper map as backup if needed :) Also I wanted to buy a kneck pillow for my return flight, but the cheapest one at every single store was 40 Bucks! I expected them to be higher, but that tops anything I have ever seen! They have desk in the gate area, with outlets which is nice. Also there are outlets in a few chairs, which is also helpful. Signage is excellent, which makes it easy to find where to go.< /Text>

a thousand times better than going to SFO!!! Convenient, smaller, less foot traffic, shorter lines..... they loose one star just because the flights are often cheaper out of SFO.<//review>

Awful security lines. Every single time I fly out, they're running at 20% of capacity making the line about 45 minutes long. Unbelievable that Chicago MDW, SFO, and Denver can operate more effectively.<//text>

<Text>This airport was great until I had to leave the parking lot. Apparently you need a debit/credit card to leave the parking lot!!! It is suppose to be convenient for patrons not just patrons with plastic!!!!  Anyway I had to back up out of the stall, pull to the side and emergency park. Jump out, find a door into airport then look for a kiosk machine (they take cash, wth?) get my ticket, run back to my car before someone hit it, pay and get out of there. Sheesh that took about 25 minutes. Besides that it was all good. Also there are no humans in the booth upon leaving so it gets confusing as what to do. There should be a HUGE sign before you get the ticket to park, it should state that people with cash have to go to the kiosk machine and get ticket before leaving. HUGE, HUGE sign!!! otherwise people with cash are screwed. Both options should be at one place not two. Why is cash treated unfairly? I don't understand why the booth doesn't have the capability to scan the money like the card. Makes no sense smh...< /Text>< userid>

<date>1406671484448</date><text>This recently renovated airport is convenient for Bay Area travellers,  especially those who live in the South Bay. It is easy to get in and out of the airport with security lines that often move rather quickly. The staff is friendly most of the time. Unlike most airports (both domestic and international) I've been to, the restroom stalls for women are quite spacious with several hooks and shelves to place belongings; they are also very clean.

The restaurant choices are quite good for an airport of this size, with an emphasis on local eateries and shops. CJ Olson Cherries is a good place to stop by for gifts and snacks while Joe's offers good pizzas.

There's also a free shuttle (Bus 10) that takes passengers to and from SJC, Santa Clara Caltrain and Metro Light Rail Station every 15-30 minutes from 5 am to 11:30pm, daily.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

< Review>
If you want to have lunch or a cocktail with your friends or family before your flight then choose another airport. The terminals are designed to accommodate passengers only. No restaurants, no lounge, few seats and no outlets in sight. Only a small, dark enclosed area for seeing people off, and a newsstand selling soda and mixed nuts. It's pretty depressing and a horrible way to send someone off. Not one person in the terminal had a smile on their face. Next time we're flying out of Oakland, SFO or Sacramento. On the plus side, its easy to get to from Amtrak, which earned them a second star.<//Review>

Agree with the previous posts and have to say this airport has one of the most unpleasant TSA staff I've ever met. Rude and unprofessional.

Not only that - they ask managed to drop my new iPad and crack the front screen when going through my laptop bag.

This occurred on 11/18/17 around 4:30pm when going though the rightmost bag scanner in terminal B security that was newly opened due to the long lines. Whoever you are I hope you get caught one day not only because of your blatant disregard for passengers property but also because you obviously dislike your work and can be more productive elsewhere.

I didn’t even find out about this until I reached my destination because the TSA agent(s) didn’t notify me my bag was being searched or that they had dropped my electronics.

I would avoid this place like the plague. Go to Oakland or SFO if you have to.<//review>

I would have given them 5 stars but they call "long term" parking "economy" parking. Why?  It's confusing. No one calls it that.</Text>

<text>TSA needs to re-evaluate the security here. They are slow, act like they want to be anywhere else but there, and have no sense of urgency.

I traveled through SJC yesterday and had two small snow globes with me - both fit in a 1 qt bag and under the 3.4oz requirement. They flagged the checkpoint, the agent at x-ray called for a bag check 3 times. it took a few minutes for someone to look up from twiddling their thumbs to come over and check my bag.

While I understand it's up the the agent to let snow globes through, the one I had was a complete jerk about it. He was slow at coming over, rolled his eyes and never made eye contact, and blankly told me I couldn't take them. I asked if I could empty them, he said I would have to go through security again to do it, all the while seeming to not care about anything but getting off work. THEN. I said "I am not going through that line again" - it was SO slow, not enough agents and the ones that were there moved like snails. And he said "fine" and took the globes and put them in a box under the x-ray system. Aren't they supposed to throw them away? Well he didn't and I am sure he has a lovely collection of other people's stuff.

While I can handle not getting the souvenirs for my children, I can't understand the sheer attitude of every TSA agent I encountered there. I fly a lot and have never had a worse experience than I did at San Jose International Airport.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This is one of the nicest airports in the United States. It's the exact opposite of San Francisco, in the sense that it's modern, has good food, has outlets, better parking options, and usable Wi-Fi. If I lived next door to SFO I would rather fly out of this airport.<//text>

Over SFO, I prefer this airport. Now that it has direct flights to Haneda, Tokyo airport, it makes it even better. The airport is smaller than SFO in size but much better thought out, especially for the travelers. People are nicer here more, in my personal opinion.<//text>

This airport is so convenient for me. I love how central it is to everything in San Jose and now that they remodeled I feel like it is finally on par with other international airports. Solid design, lots of great restaurants, and an improved rental car station. If you are coming in to work in San Jose, definitely consider flying in to SJC rather than SFO to save time. It may be a little more expensive, but SFO is such a hassle to get to compared to San Jose<//Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>This airport was great until I had to leave the parking lot. Apparently you need a debit/credit card to leave the parking lot!!! It is suppose to be convenient for patrons not just patrons with plastic!!!!  Anyway I had to back up out of the stall, pull to the side and emergency park. Jump out, find a door into airport then look for a kiosk machine (they take cash, wth?) get my ticket, run back to my car before someone hit it, pay and get out of there. Sheesh that took about 25 minutes. Besides that it was all good. Also there are no humans in the booth upon leaving so it gets confusing as what to do. There should be a HUGE sign before you get the ticket to park, it should state that people with cash have to go to the kiosk machine and get ticket before leaving. HUGE, HUGE sign!!! otherwise people with cash are screwed. Both options should be at one place not two. Why is cash treated unfairly? I don't understand why the booth doesn't have the capability to scan the money like the card. Makes no sense smh...</Review></record>

<username>Jason McCoy<//username><Text>If you want to have lunch or a cocktail with your friends or family before your flight then choose another airport. The terminals are designed to accommodate passengers only. No restaurants, no lounge, few seats and no outlets in sight. Only a small, dark enclosed area for seeing people off, and a newsstand selling soda and mixed nuts. It's pretty depressing and a horrible way to send someone off. Not one person in the terminal had a smile on their face. Next time we're flying out of Oakland, SFO or Sacramento. On the plus side, its easy to get to from Amtrak, which earned them a second star.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Pretty straight forward to navigate.  Traveling with some friends and we got there way too early, especially being TSA Pre, I blew through security and had to wait for them for 20+ minutes while they navigated the slowly moving line to get screened.  Found a nice little bar that had a mean breakfast sandwich and proceeded to have a few bloody mary's and some breakfast prior to heading out to San Diego.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Accessing the rental-car parking garage can be a challenge depending on which direction you approach the airport.  Be prepared to drive around the entire airport to make the poorly marked 'rental cars' drop-off lane.

Additionally, instead of having one giant bank of 8 or 10 elevators in the rental car parking garage, they really need to be broken up into two banks of 4 or 5.  Not very well done.

The HVAC needs some work on the gates between the terminals (15 and 16) - the perfume smell wafting down from the duty free store made me nauseous during my wait at the gate.

I do like the abundance of power / USB outlets around the airport - this is the best thing about SJC< /review>< pictures>

I thought Oakland Airport was small, SJ Airport feels smaller. I dont know if it actually is, but it sure felt that way. It was clean and the TSA was ok. I never really have issues with them. All in all, a good airport.<//Text>

<Review>I don't like this airport much because it just feels inconvinient. Terminal A is away from terminal B and if you need to go from one to another you need to go on street and either walk (not very lighted at night) or take a shuttle. Why it's two buildings not connected to each other by corridor or something so people don't need to walk (on street) between those?
Another thing is that my FastTrak keeps beeping each time exiting airport. Why? I pay for parking separately, how my FastTrak is related? Any signs explaining this? I didn't saw.

And as for pros: 1) There is a piano in terminal, so anyone can play 2) Starbucks is there (in terminal B at least)</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Small airport which means crappy food selections but easy walk from ticketing to gate.  They need to bring in less healthy options for food to try and offer fast food. I'm not into all the fru-fru foods and Gordon Birch is always packed. How about a McDonalds or a Chick-fil-A?< /review>< pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><review>It's been a long long long time since I've used SJC and I forgot just how much I like it. For an international airport it is pretty small which means it can be overcrowded but even after all of these years (20-ish) it still wasn't, bot when I arrived and when I departed. Some changes have occurred naturally but all in all it was still as I remember mostly. MUCH better than any other (and I've use MANY) other international airport in the world as far as I'm concerned. Easy to get into and out of, no long wait for baggage, security goes pretty fast and even TSA was respectful and courteous.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

This is the perfect Airport to fly in/out Silicon Valley. It's a human sized airport with very nice staff. Very well serviced by public transportation. The lines are reasonably short, you got Free Wifi (Welcome to Silicon Valley). There are pretty descent places to eat and drink. Aircrafts takeoff right after leaving the gate, without taxiing forever, same for landing. Baggage comes very quickly as well ! Most importantly, their Airport is kept clean and bathrooms are always clean too. Having moved to the US in the past years where I was disappointed with poor, dirty, unfriendly airport, SJC just stands out and is definitely to the highest standards I used to in Europe and Asia. Keep on the good work !</text>

<username>Elliot Schwartz<//username><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Small airport. It's quaint that for some flights you actually walk on the tarmac to get to the plane, rather than using a jetway -- or at least that was the case a while ago. Not great transit connections - you have to take Caltrain to Santa Clara and change to a free VTA shuttle bus.</Text>< Response>

<review>I travel a few times a year from SJC and it is easily accessible by public transit:  light rail and then shuttle.  Driving in is also a breeze.

Plenty of check-in kiosks and security, though the line can be quite long in the mornings, moves briskly. TSA is TSA, so don't expect smiles or pleasant conversations, just straight business.

Enough shops to browse and eateries to grab a bite.  Free WiFi works great and charging chairs throughout the place.

Nice place.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fcbc3fab3c59b:0xbcfa443f6df67e3e<//gmapID></record>

They put Hainan airline arrivals to terminal B on the ticket and signs on airport since beginning. It has been several years and they still didn't change anything. The signs to different parking are as confusing as before. I get lost every time when I need to pick up someone coming with Hainan airline. The right solution for picking up someone flying with Hainan Airline is to park your car at terminal A parking but not go to terminal A, u need to go to international arrivals which is not numbered by A nor B.< /text>

<Text>This is my preferred airport, and is much more accessible for South Bay'ers than either SFO or OAK.  I fly here several times per year.  The terminals are accessible, and I don't usually have to wait long for pickup or dropoff.  I have seen security harass Uber drivers, so be discreet when getting a ride.

The security line isn't too long (generally), but plan at least 20 minutes in line just in case.  The long corridor would really benefit from some moving walkways.  But in all, pretty serviceable.< /Text>< pics>

An awesome experience overall ,the airport is a representation of the neighboring silicon valley tech, The Tsa and  all crew members  who are employed and those who are not employed why the aiprots are very polite and willing to help anyone. The wifi i find the greatest perk , exceptionally fast and puts most east coast airports to shame<//Text>

2nd airport this month where a Business Class ticket or A List Member, I had both, gets you ONLY passed the line for ticket check and still need to stand in line with 25-40 people for security check/conveyors. Last time I have company pay extra for Business Class heading out of San Jose Airport.< /text>

This is a medium sized airport that's, overall, a lot more pleasant and efficient than SFO.

- A moderate number of food choices.
- The "Lounge at SJC" is pretty nice; not very crowded, and featuring some tasty light bites for lunch and complimentary drinks at the bar.
- Since the airport isn't too huge, you can typically get to your gate in 10 minutes or less from anywhere in your terminal.
- And since fog is rare here in SJ, your plane is much less likely to be delayed due to weather (coming or going) with SJC vs. SFO.< /Text>

I paid for tsa pre-check then have to tear apart my bag and wait in line to have my computer and liquids scanned... that's why I did the freaking pre-check process.  There were a bunch of us with pre-check, let's be real here, why was our lane closed when it was still busy?  There's a long line, and everyone is wAiting, the airport is definitely making money, use it to pay for tsa staff!</Text>

Great airport, nicer to deal with than SFO and convenient for anyone living in the south bay. Much quicker to get through security to the terminals, and signicantly quieter than SFO. There's a free bus service (VTA #10) that goes between the airport, Caltrain, and Light Rail station.</Review>

Ok for a smaller airport. When flying to Palo Alto I usually come in here so I don't have to deal with SFO. The only thing I don't like is the super long walk from the terminal to the rental car shuttle, but better than the train you have to take at SFO.<//Text>

LOOKS DATED ! Not much new happening at this airport. Rental cars are awkward to get to crossing a busy road from the terminal. Very slow security check points.<//Text>

<gmap_id>0x808fcbc3fab3c59b:0xbcfa443f6df67e3e</gmap_id><Review>A real 21st Century airport! I travel all over the world and this just might be my favorite of all. Why? Let me list the reasons:
1. Security took just 5 minutes. I even used passbook on my iPhone with no problem.
2. Free high speed WiFi - I actually watched a couple of You Tube videos and FaceTimed my wife with no lag.
3. Power outlets at EVERY seat! I've been to many other airports where business folks are clustered around the few power outlets hoping to charge up their phones. No problems at SJC!
4. A decent coffee shop (Peets) that isn't Starbucks. Don't get me wrong, they have Starbucks too and it's fine, but I prefer other coffee shops.
5. Car rental across the street. With a passion, I hate arriving at an airport (usually late) and then having to go on a 20 minute bus ride to the rental car center. On the return trip it makes it even worse if you're running late. Why do airports do that? BWI and Denver have ridiculous long bus rides to/from the rental car center. Stupid and inconvenient. SJC, no problem to walk across the street!

All round, a great picture of what a modern airport should be.<//Review><name>Andrew Shaw</name><time>1424466072538<//time>< Response>

<text>This is what an airport should be.

I've travelled a lot and I have to say it's one of my favorites.
It's a bit weird to review an airport since it's rarely a place you deliberately chose. But with the proximity of SFO, it can actually be the case.

First of all, it's brand new. From Parking lot to Gates and Rental Car offices, it feels like it was opened yesterday. It also means it's modern in the way it was conceived.

It's quite small. Compared to SFO, you can walk from A to B without having to rush. You can park for 1h right next to the Arrivals if you have to pick someone, it will just cost you $2 or $4.

It's Silicon Valley! They offer free WiFi. All seats in the waiting area have power and USB plugs. Very appreciable. Parkings has NFC payment (great to show off Google Wallet to visiting family!).

These are all good reasons, but the best is it's never crowded. It's much smaller than SFO, so usually it's easy to park and walk. If you're coming to the Bay Area, and not San Francisco itself, you'll find it more convenient.</text>< pics>

Flying in and out of SJC is less of a hassle compared to larger airports such as LAX, SFO, LAS, etc. In a nutshell, this airport needed a major uplift. Thanks to SJ for investing plenty of renovations, it looks absolutely nicer! I LOVE the new Terminal B!! Parking garage is larger, more vroom, vroom, vroom for cars to drive, pick up and drop off passengers for/from flights!!

TSA exceeded my expectations! If you do an early bird check in aka Southwest, AA, etc. You can just drop your luggage off quickly with the attendants and easily go through security lines that don't snake throughout the terminal area. You have enough time to enjoy hanging out at the airport's restaurants, mini bars, and shops.

Although, not much shopping here unless you consider stopping at The Hudson for a small read of their magazines. However, Peet's would be a good choice if you're still groggy for a morning flight. Grab a nice cup of coffee or tea! Unless you're off to Vegas or Miami, maybe a cocktail or beer at The Brit, while watching the news or sports while waiting for your flight, can make the time go by a lot quicker before partying it up in style!

Did I mention, they offer FREE WiFi? Yes! Of course, we're in the heart of Silicon Valley. Many tech companies in the Bay Area. For those who are always busy with work and on the go, don't fret my friends. While waiting for your flight, you can sit down with your laptop and plug it into a power outlet on the side of your seat!! How cool is that?!

Downside to SJC...ticket prices to fly in/out from here is a little bit steep as opposed to SFO or OAK but the extra dollars is worth the trip! Happy travels!</Text>

Label your directories correctly. People don't have time to walk to other terminals when your "restaurants" aren't even open to the public.< /Review>

This is a model of a "perfect" airport.

Operational reasons:
Best on-time performance ranking in California.
Weather-delays are exceedingly rare - only 5 days per year.
Not overwhelmingly-busy like SFO.
Good highway/road traffic management.
Somewhat fast TSA lines.

--Amenities--:
Free & Fast WiFi.
Free ground transportation to VTA/Caltrain.
Power outlets in gate areas.
Clean and modern seating areas and bathrooms.

The best domestic carriers:
Virgin, Southwest, Jet Blue. Yay.

Negatives:
All parking (even the "economy lot") can be expensive. $20/day minimum.
Terminal B is nearly a half-mile long (!). That's about a 10 minute walk from end-to-end.< /Text>

It took me a long time at security check because of my ipad and coin pocket, I understand that it is Silicon Valley but making my baggage that I packed for half an hour into a mess is still very desperating.</text>

Here is a Small international airport and it has free wifi could use when you're waiting for a next fright trip in airport lobby. Free shuttle buses could take you to Rental car center and pick up your rental car. (SEP 25,16)< /Text>

The TSA that works at Mineta is so incompetent. They shuffle people in the wrong direction. They do not check if you are pre check and guide you into the wrong line. They look bored and disinterested and have no ability to move a crowd of people through security. They really do need training and guidance.<//review>

It is very very annoying to be sitting here waiting for your plane and I'm over here at gate 1 through 5 and there's this little Contraption in there and it is making so much noise and if you're tired or noid this little noise would just bother you they shouldn't have this in the place of where people are trying to travel it is not relaxing and it's just annoying<//Text>

Terrible delays in TSA screening.  No notifications to passengers, even though this is the Silicon Vally gateway.  Don't they monitor screening times?  Can't they automatically update customers?  My suggestion is to fly one of the other airports in bay area, either SF or Oakland!</review>

It serves its purpose...
TSA agents here are quite rude, and not helpful. I would much rather fly out of one of the other airports in the area.</review>

<review>Airport didn't seem to open till 4am. The closed security gate was very confusing to passengers. On top of that, my flight was delayed for an hour, causing me to miss my connecting flight. They had to de ice the plane first, but they failed to find a working service vehicle for the job and failed to find a second.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Airport didn't seem to open till 4am. The closed security gate was very confusing to passengers. On top of that, my flight was delayed for an hour, causing me to miss my connecting flight. They had to de ice the plane first, but they failed to find a working service vehicle for the job and failed to find a second.<//Text>

Uber and Lyft are banned here and the traffic cops are rude and aggressive so you're forced to take an overpriced taxi.< /Review>

If you are flying into this airport and have to wait for a ride, you will be horribly sorry. The "greeting area" is a joke. There are no restaurants past security. And not a single outlet in sight.< /Text>

SJC is more handy for silly valley than SFO is. Shame it has such poor connections. Perhaps things are looking up, now that BA is about to start scheduled services from London.< /text>

(Translated by Google) A very large but very well ordered place, there are many places to eat and also to drink. You can find many things keychains, mugs, shirts, glasses, among others. The staff is attentive except the Volaris (they almost always treat you badly, they shouldn't) there are several stations to drink water or if you bring a thermos you can refill it. This airport is very well located in the center of San José.

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>(Translated by Google) Fairly comfortable airport. All airlines have their own terminal - it’s convenient and easy to figure out! Absolutely clear routing. All stages of passing control are well organized. The staff is friendly and always ready to help. They will explain, even if you do not speak American.

(Translated by Google) The current parking lot came to the old San Jose airport at a high school summer vacation homestayI was burning in the sun in the black and perming the clinklin only during the summer vacation, so I was suspicious that I was Mexican, so I asked the immigration inspector I couldn't get any English into my head, but it was solidified, but someone who could speak Japanese came and helped me. My dad at IBM was busy and could hardly meet in the morning or evening on weekdays, but on holidays he took horseback riding and golf and took him to various places. American ice cream is rich and impressive.

(Original)
現在の駐車場が昔のサンノゼ空港で高校の夏休みホームステイで来た私は真っ黒に陽に焼けて夏休みの間だけクリンクリンにパーマをかけていたのでメキシコ人だと怪しまれたのか入国審査官にまくし立てられ全く英語が頭に入って来ず固まったが日本語の出来る人が来て助けてくれた。IBM勤めのお父さんは忙しく平日は朝も夜もほとんど会えなかったが休日は乗馬したりゴルフしたりいろんな所に連れて行ってくれた。アメリカアイスが濃厚で感動。< /review>

(Translated by Google) Since it is not a large airport, the waiting time for each work is relatively short and it goes smoothly overall. There is also a little shopping space at the airport.
International flights are basically Terminal A and domestic flights are Terminal B, but in some cases domestic flights may leave from Terminal A, so it is recommended to check in advance. That was the case before when I went to New York on United Air.
When my parents came to California, I took a direct flight from this airport to Japan. Actually, flights from Japan to San Francisco are cheaper at tens of thousands of yen, but my parents do not have much experience traveling abroad, so I dared to choose a direct flight to this airport so as not to get lost in the airport. My parents also said it wasn't difficult to arrive.
You can rest assured that someone will manage the belt lane when your luggage arrives. The lanes at this airport are short and can quickly fill up with luggage. I was worried that the bag wouldn't break.

(Original)
大きい空港ではないので各作業の待ち時間も比較的少なく全体的にスムーズに進んでくれます。空港内の買い物スペースも少しはあります。
国際線はターミナルA、国内線はターミナルBと基本的にはなっていますが、場合によってはターミナルAから国内線が出ることもあるので事前にしっかり確認することをおすすめします。以前にユナイテッドAirでニューヨークに行くときがそうでした。
私の両親がカリフォルニアに来た時にこの空港の日本との直行便を利用しました。本当は日本~サンフランシスコのほうが数万円と航空券が安いのですが、私の両親は海外旅行の経験が多くはないので空港内で迷わないようにあえてここの空港との直行便を選びました。両親も到着してみて難しくなかったと言っていました。
荷物が到着したときのベルトレーンを管理してくれる人がいたほうが安心できます。この空港のレーンは短いのですぐに荷物でいっぱいになってしまいます。バッグが壊れないか不安でした。< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I was surprised to be bigger than 13 years ago. Just by people walking, the slabs shook and swayed, and the buildings that were swaying were also renovated, and there was no anxiety. I was surprised that the long term parking lot on the back had disappeared. The car rental building has also moved, and everything was new. Once upon a time, the international arrivals lobby was a shack as seen in the southern island countries.

<review>(Translated by Google) ANA's check-in counter opens 3 hours before departure. The same applies to the luggage deposit counter. If you want to get in the airport earlier than this, you can do "online check-in" with "only carry-on luggage". You can use "The Club at SJC" with Priority Pass (as of May 2018). In front of Gate 15, often very close to the departure gate for ANA flights. It is about 15 minutes by car from San Jose city, so it is quite close. Baggage inspection takes a considerable amount of time. When crowded, it's better to wait for an hour just in case. By the way (although there are no ANA customers alone), it is quite vacant because the peak is exceeded early in the morning 3 hours before the departure of ANA flight.

(Original)
ANAのチェックインカウンターは出発時刻の3時間前にオープンする。荷物の預入カウンターも同様。これ以上早く空港内に入りたい場合は「機内持ち込み荷物のみ」で「オンラインチェックイン」すれば良い。（2018年5月時点で）プライオリティパスで「The Club at SJC」が使える。ゲート15の前で、多くの場合ANA便の出発ゲートのすぐ近く。なお、サンノゼ市内からは車で15分程度なのでかなり近い。手荷物検査が相当時間がかかる。混雑時は念のため1時間見ておいた方がいい。ちなみに（別にANAの客だけででは全く無いが）ANA便の出発3時間より前は朝早くピークを越えてるからか、かなり空いている。< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) I am very satisfied with the service and car rented at the San Jose airport branch. The BMW mini Countryman had 8000 miles on the clock and was very clean inside and out. The taking of possession was fast and exactly according to the arrangements of reservation. Without pressure to add protections. The return was also fast and without problems. I recommend this place.

(Original)
Je suis très satisfait du service et de l'auto louée à la succursale de l'aéroport de San Jose. La BMW mini Countryman avait 8000 milles au compteur et était très propre à l'intérieur et l'extérieur. La prise de possession a été rapide et exactement selon les modalités de réservation. Sans pression pour ajouter des protections. Le retour a aussi été rapide et sans problèmes. Je recommande cet endroit.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The smallest of the three Bay Area airports, but also the most relaxing. TSA and Security went fixed, the arrival is also very relaxed. Good and free bus connection to the Caltrain in Santa Clara. At the gates of Terminal B (British Airways) there are rich dining options and at every waiting seat a power outlet. This is exemplary and makes the waiting easier. All in all a top experience.

(Original)
Der kleinste der drei Bay-Area-Flughäfen, gleichzeitig aber auch der entspannteste. TSA und Security gingen fix, beim Ankommen geht es auch sehr entspannt zu. Gute und kostenlose Busanbindung zum Caltrain in Santa Clara. An den Gates des Terminals B (British Airways) gibt es reichhaltige Essensmöglichkeiten und an jedem Wartesitz eine Steckdose. Das ist vorbildlich und macht das Warten leichter. Alles in allen eine Toperfahrung.<//review>
