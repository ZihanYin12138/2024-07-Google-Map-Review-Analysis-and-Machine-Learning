< Review>
Some covid precautions were still in place, as they should be.  Didn't have to wait.  Dr. Domotor gave Junie a thorough yearly exam and explained important points to me.  I've been going to this vet for 26 years and wouldn't think of letting anyone else care for my cats.<//Review>

I have taken my pets to Dr. Domotor for over 30 years.  I am continually  impressed by the knowledge and customer focus of the vets and the staff.  They all seem to truly care about the health of my pets.  Over the years, a few of our pets have had serious problems (e.g., swallowing something that obstruct their stomachs).  The team at Dr. Domotor's Animal House treated these problems with skill and expertise.  I know my pets are in good hands at the Animal House.< /text>

I have taken all of my pets to Dr. Domotor since I moved to Monrovia more than 25 years ago, and recommend her to anyone who asks.  They are caring, professional, and trustworthy.  I wouldn't trust my pets to go anywhere else!  Highly recommend them!!!< /Text>

<Review>I took my 5 year old pit bull here for the first time and I am so happy I did. Everyone is very patient and listens to all of your concerns. They are so sweet and kind to my Bella and they didn’t force me to buy any extra products like most vets have done to me. This will definitely be the regular hospital I bring my dog to. Also the prices were very fair, cost less than all other vets I have taken my dogs to.<//Review>< user_name>

Dr. Domotor and Dr. Byrne have been so patient and caring for our very sick puppy when no other Vet would accept him during pandemic because he was a new patient.  He has been thriving and doing well under their care.  They are always flexible and nurturing to our Ollie.</Review>

Dr. Domotor has been our vet for over 25 years.  She's the best doctor around.
As always Dr. Domotor goes above and beyond when it comes to caring for my dogs.  I recently made an appointment for one of my dogs who was sick.  I sent an email to the office in advance of the appointment to let them know what was going on with him.  After reading it, Dr. Domotor had me bring him in the same day.  Thankfully she did that because he was sicker than I realized.  He's doing better now and I am truly grateful.<//Text>

This Dr makes you feel calm he is very good with your pet and when you call and leave a message for him he returns your call pretty fast and is willing to offer up help with any concerns you may have   .I would recommend him even though it seems like alot to pay but it's worth it . Plus he's way cheaper then other Dr that do house calls plus you get piece of mind knowing your animal is actually being looked at not like when you go visit the Dr and they go in alone .totally worth every hard earned penny</text>

The staff at Animal House Vet are wonderful!  They took great care of us and and our dog JoyBear.  They understood that going to a new veterinarian is stressful and they took the time we needed and explained the difference in needs for JoyBear in Hawaii.  They made all of us feel like we had always been part of their Ohana. I highly recommend them for all of your pets needs.< /review>

< Review>
Appalling and horrendous.  That's the only way to describe my experience.  Yesterday, as I was riding my bike past Dr. Domotor's around 4:45pm, I noticed that there was a dead parrot in the grass in front of the "Animal Hospital".  I figured some low-life that couldn't be bothered to properly dispose of it had left it there to make it another person's problem.  Well, it became mine.

I went inside and told the lady at the front desk that there was a dead parrot outside of the building.  When she looked at me like she didn't know what to do, I offered to bring it inside if she gave me a box and a pair of gloves.  A lady came out in scrubs, and the first lady asked her if she would take care of it.  Her response was "I'm off the clock.  Can't you call Animal Control?"  The first lady then thanked me for telling them and assured me they would take care of it.

Well, I guess everyone was off the clock.  They didn't do anything, not even call Animal Control.  In this case, that would be the Pasadena Humane Society and SPCA.  I called them this morning after I walked past the building and the bird was still there.  When I called Dr. Domotor's to let them know what happened, I didn't even get a response, they just hung up on me without saying anything.

To make it clear, I would have been willing to take care of the bird myself in other circumstances.  Years ago, driving past a restaurant I worked at (on my day off), I noticed a dead cat in the road in front of the building.  I stopped, borrowed a shovel, and buried the cat away from the building.  Had I not, there's no telling how long it would have been there.  It's also less likely that the litter of kittens with her, which were still alive, would have been saved.  I don't usually carry a shovel on my bike, and I wasn't about to put a dead parrot in my pocket so I could rub it with my thumb like Lenny Small.

I also understand that you might be wary about a dead animal, and want to take certain precautions before exposing it to other animals.  There is absolutely no excuse for just leaving a dead animal in front of an "Animal Hospital" overnight, or even for ten minutes.  Perhaps at least somebody there has a brain and genuine concern for animals, but at least three don't.  If you take your pets there, good luck with the ones that end up handling them.< /Review>

<Review>Dr Damotor found a heart murmur that other vets missed. She was thorough and kind. Unlike my previous vet, she didn't suggest expensive unnecessary tests. She's the most knowledgeable vet I've ever met. The front office staff is equally amazing: competent, attentive, and clearly love animals.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I stopped going to Dr. Domoter shorty after prices went up. Also, the final straw for us was when I made an appointment to get my dog groomed, took time out of a very busy day to get there, and when I returned 5 hours later, I was told that they couldn't get to my dog (who had an appointment for a week) because they got in a full size poodle just that day. I asked if the full sized poodle had an appointment and the receptionist just stared at me with a blank face and shrugged. Why don't you try respecting people's time and maybe you will retain clientele.</review>

<Text>May 31, 2014. I called seeking advice on a rattlesnake bite my dog suffered a few days ago. I asked for rates and possible options, which I was given. As I ended my call that last words given to me were

'Your dog is going to die' Only a cold, heartless, uncaring, compassion less individual could be capable of uttering such things at a time like this. I have taken my pets here before, but will never do that or recommend them to anyone. I urge you to find a vet with a respectable staff and someone that knows how to answer a phone and treat you and your pet with dignity!!!

My name is David Borchart, I wrote this, stand by this AND approved this post!< /Text><UserId.>107002516727601768626</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80c2d943b829aecf:0xdebb42e047bc37cb< /Gmap_id><Rate>1</Rate>< date>

< Review>
Dr. Domotor is without comparison, in my 30+ years of working with vets throughout the state of California.  She has taken care of dozens of my adopted cats and dogs, all in varying states of poor health and abuse.   I have recommended her services to friends and family who have felt their animals had problems other vets had failed to properly diagnose or treat.  They travel from Fresno, Santa Barbara, San Pedro, etc.

I find her prices reasonable, and the extent of her compassion and care for each individual animal, as well as her education of the animals' companions, to a degree I have never experienced elsewhere.<//Review>

I have been a steady customer for many years.  I would not take my cats anywhere else.  She may charge more, but you get service and care that is worth it.  Janie Duncan</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>My first time -- had no choice because my beloved German Shepherd (Precious) collapsed and I was referred. Dr. Domotor gave it to me straight -- Precious had cancer (Hemangiosarcoma) with extensive internal bleeding. I asked for her opinion and decided it was best to put Precious out of her misery. The whole procedure was very professional and all the staff were very comforting.  Precious went to sleep very quietly and peacefully, which was my biggest concern. They even sent me a clay paw print with her name on it --- little things like that which meant a lot.

If ever I get another dog, I'll be going here.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

He was used as a bait dog when he was three weeks old, so his life did not begin with the best circumstances. He has been going to Dr. Domotor's since he was 6 weeks old and everyone knows and loves him. Just last month (April 2013) he was diagnosed with a Mast Cell Tumor. He had surgery and someone laid with him while he recovered (he cries like a baby). He is scared of Yorkies, and they are very understanding of that too. I wish I could use them as my primary! Dr. Byrns is wonderful...and she makes me laugh. Dr. Domotor is an excellent surgeon...and she makes me laugh too!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Domotor's Doggie Dachau

I left my 10 1/2 year old spayed Lab for three nights kenneling.  I took two standard bed pillows in sewn-together cases, a cotton throw rug that goes on top of the pillows, and in a large zip-lock a T-shirt I'd worn to provide my scent, a squeaky toy, and several large crunchy bones. I verbally asked them to place the pillow in her kennel and to give the dog the T-shirt, squeaky toy, and one crunchy bone per day.  The assistant acknowledged this.  The vet's assistant removed my dog's collar and scarf and gave them to me, saying they could be a choke hazard.  (It's the first time I'd had this occur for kenneling - there must have been a tragic experience in the past, but better safe than sorry)  I inspected the individual kennel my dog was in.  It was very clean and had a clean blanket on the concrete floor.  I was not allowed to open the gate and place the pillows inside, but was assured my dog would have them.

After the three nights I returned for my dog.  The dog was as healthy as when I left her.  I put her collar back on and asked for the pillows, T-shirt, etc. In a jiffy the assistant returned with the pillows, rug, and zip-lock.  The zip-lock contained the T-shirt, squeaky toy, and ALL of the crunchy bones.  The T-shirt, pillows, and rug had no dog hair on them.

I highly suspect that my pure bred, ACK-papers, house-dog had to sleep on a blanket over concrete with nothing to remind her of 10 1/2 years with her owner, or hope that she would be reunited with me.  My dog is healthy and Dr. Domnotor's kennel is very clean.  I have no complaint about the safety or sanitation of the kennels.  But I think I sent my dog to a Doggy Dachau.  She will not be kenneled there again.< /Text>

My mom has been going to Dr Demotor for 15 years. We moved during that time and have tried new vets that are closer. Every time we try a new vet we end up taking the animal back to Dr. Demotor because the other vets don't have the experience or knowledge about taking care of tricky issues. We have a dog with a gum infection we took her to another vet for 3 years and she lost over half her teeth. We got fed up and took her to Dr Domotor and the infection was clear within a few months. I have a cat who got into a fight. I tried taking her to VCA and they didnt find the puncture wounds. Because they didnt find the wounds the first time bacteria festered under her skin and now, a week later, she is loosing almost half of the skin on her back. The doctors at Dr Domotors office decided to take a skin culture to be sure that we were fighting the disease with the right antibiotics. No to mention they remembered to give me painkillers... Yea Dr. Domotor is expensive but it's a sure way to guarantee that your pet will get proper treatment by experienced professionals. You wont spend all your money visiting the vet for the same reason over and over. I hope they stay in business for as long as my cat will live.<//review>

I've been using Dr Domotor's Animal House as my vet of choice for over 20 years now and there just isn't any one to compare them with in the area. I'm not sure who cares more for my pets... The Doctors and Staff or ME. They really do care about all my critters and not just when they are sick.< /Review>

I’ve traveled from North Hollywood to Burbank to Glendale to find the perfect smoke shop and after visiting this place - I have finally found it! They have everything, and I mean everything you could possibly want! Vape? Flavors you didn’t even know existed are available here! Hookah? All the top flavors from top brands always in stock! Friendly service? Sarkis and anyone else I’ve met here, I felt like I’m shopping at my friends store rather a stranger! Seriously, I won’t be trying to find another shop because this place is the freaking best!<//review>

This is the only smoke shop in Glendale/LA worth going to. They are always extremely helpful and nice and have a big selection with low prices as well. I always leave really happy with the way they treat the customers like family or guests.</review>

<Text>Found them on google and called to see if they carried what I was looking for...They had everything I needed so I ordered a few different flavors of tobacco, tips, and charcoal for hookah! They called me back 3 minutes later and said my order was ready for curbside pick up! It was a fast and easy experience, will definitely return for more!! Hands down the best smoke shop in Glendale!!<//Text>< UserId.>

First time customer and I had a great experience. The owner was very friendly and made buying what I needed a breeze. Fully recommend coming here for anyone looking to buy anything hookah related.

I called ahead wondering what the process would be during these times. He answered the phone quickly and informed me to park in the parking lot and call back so he can help me. We made our way into the store, and the options available are great. He had a wide variety of products and the store itself was nice.

He does curbside pickup and delivery as well. The owner obviously cares about customer service and making sure the customer is satisfied.<//text>

After all my calls to different smokes shops, this is the only place answered my call and all my questions.

They delivered my tobacco needs.
Very friendly people, I really appreciate what they did on this Covid day.

I smoke. Thank you, my fellow Californian's, for making tobacco even more expensive for the un-rich. Maybe one day there will be a ballot measure to vote yourselves into bankruptcy.
Until then, you're nuts if you buy smokes anywhere else...unless you're rich.

I said "good day!"<//text>

< Review>
Good basic pizza. Good crust slight crunch with no flop. On the heavy side. Little bit of grease but I’ve seen worse. 22$ for a large pepperoni I feel is about 5-6$ to much. I’d give it 3.5 stars if I could.<//Review>

These workers are so nice and so helpful. I am so appreciative of them. I had a mix up with my Uber eats order and a sweet girl I talked to helped me out to get it fixed. She was so kind and accommodating. I will always order from mountain Mike’s because of their great customer service! Thank you so much.< /Review>

<text>One of the best pizza shops in town. I order online and it's always coming out of the oven when I arrive. The pizza is always fresh and loaded with toppings. Tried the mozzarella sticks for the first time today and both the sticks and the wedges were delicious. Employees are fast, friendly, and attentive to their customers. A little pricey but worth it for great food.<//text>< Time>

I do not recommend this place do to the lack of communication and customer service. First I called three times over the phone thinking I had bad service so I order thru DoorDash for pickup when it was time to pick up my order the guy in the front told me that my order didn’t go thru an then tells me that they are putting my order in with out asking me what I ordered.  Not a good experience I had to wait over an two hours.< /Text>

Told me my pizza would be ready in 20 min. My pizza took 50 min. To get ready. I asked for 3 extra ranches for a mtn pizza and 18 wings. That would have brought me to 5 total. They had the balls to charge me 3 dollars for them. The manager was right there and just smiled. They didn't say anything about sorry for the wait or anything. Great customer service.<//Text>

We had pizza delivered and we were disappointed with the sausage pizza.  It was double sausage but there were two pieces that had no meat.  The others combined for less than 3 pieces on each piece.  I think we'll try someone else.</text>

I ordered a Pizza and when i opened the box it was as if i ordered a olive pizza. Could not see any meat just olives and it was disgusting. I called and manager Patrick was so rude and literly yelled at me and told me he is the Owner and what did i want from him and that he wasnt going to do anything for me and i could call corporate. He was so rude. Never met any one so rude and disrespectful. So yes he really upset me so i literally told him " What he can do with his rude self and no good tasting pizza!!"</Text>

Been ordering from this place for years but now their boss won't let them deliver to me anymore.  I live 3.2 miles away from them but they all of a sudden can't be bothered! I ordered a pizza every week from this location and always give a good tip. Well if they don't want my money anymore then screw them. I'll take my business to the brimhall location which is 3.1 miles Away from me but are always nice and never give me any problem. I'm tired of giving my business to a place that doesn't value their long time weekly customers anyway. Their new boss sucks really really bad!< /Text>

< review>
Shame on Mountain Mike's Pizza on Stockdale Highway! My boyfriend has been ordering from them for years. He lives 3.2 miles away and they claim it's too far all of a sudden. For the past few months they've said well you have to order between $25- $45 (depending on who is working). It's just pitiful for an establishment to treat their faithful (and by faithful I mean he orders at least once a week) patrons in such a manner. Shame on whoever is running this place now!<//review>

<Review>Stopped for happy hour (ends at 6pm) and had  some boneless wings half off, and since it was a Tuesday, I got a pizza for 40% off! Blue cheese dressing requested for wings came at no extra cost and the pizza was fantastic!<//Review>< Rate>

Ordered extra crispy, got it burned, pepperoni was burned so bad, we had to take them off and settle for burnt crust. Never going back again. Totally ruined my night. The kids and I were so hungry we ate it anyway.<//text>

<review>Pizza here is good, especially the canadian bacon. So what is the problem? Bad Service. The ladies there are really nice but when you call for a pick up order they tell you it is 20 minutes. However actual time was 28 minutes and they do not let you know it is done you have to go back to the counter to ask if its done. At least last time this happened at a competing parlor they made it right and threw in some wings.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Most definitely add bacon as a topping, it's that crunchy, greasy , charred at the tips bacon , its all sizzling when they bring you the pizza  ,and the bacon grease slides onto the cheese for extra flavor.  The ambiance is simple and small , but you can surely come enjoy a game witha a crowd of 6 .</Text>

Got a coupon on my email for a free medium pizza and when i called to order they said they had never heard of this coupon. When the email and coupon was specifically for this mountain mikes location.. doesnt seem right to me. Usually you have to honor what it says right??</text>

<review>Decided to order just before closing time. The person taking my order over the phone said no rush your Pizza will be here when you arrive. As such it was hott and ready for me a few minutes after their official closing  time. Thank you for that great gesture and customer service. It had been about 10 years since I had Mountain Mike's in my old town and since moving to Bakersfield. But with that first bite it brought back all those great memories. And just know its still that great tasting pizza I remember since back when. But I actually feel like such a fool for having settled for less. All those nasty card board tasting pizza's... But never again. Thanks guys and wifey loved it. First time Mountain Mike's experience for her...B♡MB PIZZA...m< /review><Gmap_id>0x80ea41f4095e3861:0xb58448a562a0d784<//Gmap_id>< user>

< Review>
I am a pizza junky. At one point living on the east coast and returning home to retaste the so-called "pizza" this town passes off, I was missing somthing. . . REAL PIZZA! until my fiance and I tried this place. It blew my dang mind how good the sauce was, fresh the cheese and dough were and also how quickly they had it ready. These guys rock!</Review>

It arrives in 15 mins. Granted I live around the corner. When I dine in they are always curteous and accommodating. I think jacal is an angry dodger fan who got mad when he saw all the world series champion giants deco on the wall...</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Great place! Good flavors and the staff is usually friendly. I think the flavors are fairly standard and this place does not deserve a special trip, but if you want to get that froyo, this place will hit the spot.</Review>< gmapID>

<user>106034451531078693644<//user><review>Let me tell you... if you need a little or a lot of CULTURE in your life, then this is THEEE Place!
I've been coming here with my friend for years and it never disappoints. He usually stocks up and orders 3 large Plain Tarts to go. I have tried the plethora of yogurt and sorbet flavors as well as the smorgasbord of toppings they have to offer.

The owner and the staff are always happy, efficient and make you feel like a welcomed part of their family.
I'm always satisfied and already looking forward to my next visit!
Highly recommended!</review>< rate>

This is a really nice shop on a street full of interesting stires and restaurants.  Throughout the pandemic they’ve still kept all of their usual toppings and drizzles (40+) available but behind protective glass.  They have an employee that adds whatever you would like so the toppings are safe from outside contamination.</review>

This place is AWESOME!! I'm not sure how long it's been here but I've been in this neighborhood for over a year and have just now discovered it!!

I love their flavors. It's not overly sweet or drowned with vanilla. It's perfect!!< /review>

Dear lord! Brownie sundae. We went there looking for chocolate cake since we had read that they had some of the best in town in one of the food/LA mags. But thankfully, they were out of the cake and I "settled" on the brownie sundae. So this was ridiculously rich and amazing and fattening and so worth it!!  Way dense hot fudge. I needed coffee to cut the richness. Should have just ate the coffee grounds.  Seriously. My favorite gluttony spot now. I will eat this until I am sick and will be the happiest chubby person on the planet.  This is about the only place I will plan to chug carbs at.  Diet be damned.< /text>

Came here for the famous ice cream sandwiches. The sandwich part tastes like macaroons. And they are dipped halfway in white chocolate, my fave. We tried the blueberry ice cream sandwich and the red velvet ice cream sandwich. It is definitely something you have to try, at least once! I want to try more flavors, so I will be back.

The parking situation is a little weird. You have to park across the street behind a store. It's marked where you can park, but you may have to double park which is a drag because we got parked behind and you have to go back inside the store to let them know so that they can find the people so you can move your car. Or people will ignore that and just park so that no one can park behind them.<//text>

<Review>You can't miss the line that goes all the way outside the door for this place. The ice cream here is delicious with many unique flavors to choose from. The baked goods the sell hear are also equally as good! You can create your own ice cream sandwich with the cookies they have. The place is small with not a lot of seating inside and out so its best to have some napkins ready and be prepared to eat standing.<//Review><rate>4< /rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

I walked right up to the counter a couple of minutes before closing.  Oh how I wish I could have gotten more than just 2 ice cream sandwiches.  Everything looked yummy.  My husband and I shared the salty caramel and coffee toffee.  They were delicious!  I can't wait to go back and try other favors.<//review>

This is a nice and popular ice cream place to visit. I came here with some friends to grab dessert. We got the peanut butter flavor and the earl grey plum sorbet. I definitely love the earl grey one a lot. It was very light and fragrant; opens up appetite and not heavy after a full dinner. The price was more expensive than other ice cream shops in CA but there's still a lot of customers.<//Text>

We had the herb roasted chicken breast sandwich and prosciutto/provolone sandwich which were divine. Mac & Cheese was delicious and a good sized portion.  Soup of the day was a Caramelized Cauliflower which tasted more like brocoli but still good. So many desserts.. how can you decide what to choose?! All in all a great experience 5 stars.</review>< Gmap_id>

Great little shop to get hard to find Asian themed flavors. It has a very nostalgic feeling to the place. The prices are reasonable and the kids seem to love coming here. I did not think that I would like the avocado ice cream as much as I did. I need to try the Ube on my next visit.<//Text>

The ice cream is good, but $3.50 for one scoop is a bit pricey. I had the coffee toffee and Nutella, the texture is really nice and creamy. I had to ask what flavors there was, no label. Customer service was friendly.</review>

<Text>The Thai tea ice cream macaroon is just amazing... Thai tea has to be the best flavor I've tried so far! Definitely going back to try more flavors! The macaroon ice cream is huge and literally can be divided in half for two people to share. The reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is because parking can be a bust. Very limited parking spots and make sure you don't park around the neighborhood at a certain time because you WILL get a parking ticket!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

They ran out of red velvet when I went so I got the Salted Caramel.  WAY salty! I still finished it but boy, did I need some hydration after.  My friend got the Earl Grey which was what I wanted initially but we all decided to order something else.  If you were to try something other than the red velvet, I'd say the Earl Grey just because it's such a soft floral taste, like tea. Yummms!</review>

We decided to roll in here after dinner.  It was about 10:30 pm and there was a line outside.  I think it took us about 20 mins to get inside.  The line does move quickly.  As soon as we got up to the counter, we ordered to ice cream sandwiches.  I got the blood orange ice cream with molasses cookie and the other ice cream sandwich was super chunk peanut butter cookie with chocolate ice cream.  The ice cream sandwiches are huge.  It tasted good.  We also ordered a red velvet popper and a slice of blue velvet cake.  We just came to see what the hype was all about.<//Review>

<Text>OMG!!! Dessert heaven!

They had a fridge full of handmade ice cream sandwiches and ice cream bars. A case full of decorative cupcakes and other awesome treats filled with goodness!

I shared the strawberry shortcake bar with my boyfriend. After my first bite I wished I didn't share. The crust they had on the ice cream bar made it feel like I was eating a frozen strawberry short cake.

The workers were very friendly and gave us some suggestions. The only thing that sucked was the parking, since you have to find street parking! But I won't take any stars off for that since I absolutely loved the ice cream!<//Text>< pictures>

Their chicken with bacon mashed potatoes were so yummy even my daughter who hates mashed potatoes was fighting over it with her niece.  This place is well worth the drive.. Food is delicious.. Not to mention their desserts!! Blue velvet cake was very good.. A little sweet but perfect for sharing and their Thai tea ice cream sandwiches are to die for!! Thai tea flavored macaron for the sandwich and Thai tea ice cream.. Heavenly.  We got a Thai tea for the girls and knew right away this place was legit.  Stop on by.. I highly recommend it!!< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>We are so happy about this place ! I don't know what else to say... Sophia loves Froyo frozen yogurt, she also loves the toppings, there always filled up and re-stocked, the gummy worms are always soft and there hardly out of anything. One time I did snap at them because they didn't have any tart. Please have pomegranate tart and let's bring back pistachio. :)</text><username>shara shahouni</username>< gmapID>

Parking here is fairly easy. I've never had problems parking on the residential streets.  The place has a sheek ice cream parlor feel.  Usually there is a line, so while in line have someone order and reserve a table since tables are limited.  This is the best blue velvet  cake I have ever had.  I've never tasted anything so succulent and mouthwatering.  Just foodreaming about it makes me want to drive all the way to LA just to get a slice. The size of the slice is perfect. Not too big or small. Just right. Every bite of it makes your teeth tremble with explosives.  At the end of the slice there is left over white cheesecake frosting . I love the taste even by itself.  That's how you know you have good frosting.  The other day I tried  their strawberry shortcake milkshake. My goodness. If the Beatles were around, I think they would have written Strawberry Field Forever on this. Yes.< /text>

<Text>Macaroon ice cream sandwiches!!! Life doesn't get better than that. Do yourself a favor and try the Banana Dulce de Leche ice cream. You will not regret it! And do not be intimidated by the line. It goes fast and you will be thankful you waited. Though, don't expect to get a sit right away or inside, but where you are sitting won't even matter.< /Text>< pics>

Macaron ice cream sandwiches?  Yes, please!  Big macarons with ice cream in the middle!   I wanted to try the red velvet ice cream sandwich, but when I came here after lunch, they were already sold out.  I also wanted to try the blue velvet cake which was really good!  I also got the cookies n creme ice cream sandwich instead, it pleased me despite not getting to try the red velvet.  I'll go back one day in hopes that I'll get to try it.</Review>

I love coming here for their sweets. Never had the food, so I can't rate that. Their specialties are the ice cream macaron sandwiches. Such an amazing combination! I have had the red velvet, coffee, and thai tea sandwiches, which are to die for! They have a lot of different flavors so you're bound to find one that suits you!
Parking is a little hard because you have to find street parking. Make sure to read the signs for residential areas, because they only allow cars with permits to park there after a certain time.</Text>< user_name>

Rich ice cream and they open late on weekends! Too bad the parking might be a problem if you went during the day.

Usually come here for the ice cream fix on late night. Have not tried their salads or sandwiches, but they looked yummy as well. Will definitely give it a try.< /Review>

<Review>The ice-cream macaron sandwiches are really good here. I especially enjoy the thai tea flavor. I dream about them sometimes. Actually, many times. The macaron adds a delightful chewy texture to the ice-cream without being too sweet. And I like that the ice-cream is hard so it doesn't squirt out as you bite into it.< /Review>< Pictures>

All of their Macaron sandwiches are amazing. Tasty and not too sweet. My all time favorite is the red velvet one. How can anyone go wrong with red velvet?

Strawberry shortcake bars are good but I rather stick to the macaroni sandwiches.

At times, you can wait in line for up to 40 minutes for your goodies. wooosaaah! They should definitely change up the order system but then again, that might be done on purpose so the line forms out the door and around the corner. You know, especially out here in Montrose, if there's a line, IT MUST BE GOOD! Sometimes...< /review>

I virtually NEVER sit down and just relax- but this place makes me never want to leave. It's the cookies and milk world for grown-ups (bc TRUST- children cannot afford these prices). The style is like a pinterest page come to life- just lean into it and enjoy the frills. A great little refuge for girlfriends to catch up or get a quiet moment to yourself. It's a little DIY with an adorable couple, so if you're into supporting local businesses, this is a great way to support!<//Text>

My first visit here to "Froyo Life". It seems to be a pretty well known place here in Los Angeles, and it seems to be a late night dessert place. My cousins actually took us here one night while visiting them down here in SoCal.

Most of the time, you'll probably be standing here in line, waiting and waiting for your turn to order since it's a small place, and seemingly very popular. With limited seating as well, only like a few tables inside and a few tables outside.

I ordered a "Triple Chocolate Shake", which was $6.50. It tasted pretty decent, chocolate galore haha.  My cousins and family ordered the Ice Cream Sandwiches or the macarons if you wanna call them that too.

We didn't have to look so hard for parking since my cousins lived nearby, but for others who don't quite have that luxury, parking will be a hassle for you seeing as they don't have their own parking lot.

Overall great first experience!</Text>

Got a free scoop from buying 1 scoop on national ice cream day, so it was a very good deal! I had hazelnuts crunch and banana dulce de leche on waffle cone. Think their ice cream tend to be too sweet, but both flavors I had today weren't disappointing, and the cone was very crispy too.< /review>

Yes, each ice cream sandwich and ice cream bar is $5 (prior to tax), but it is very well worth the money.  However, if you're not a very big sweets fan, I recommend that you share an ice cream sandwich or bar with 1 other person or 2 other people.  Our family has only tried the Red Velvet ice cream sandwich, and one was sufficient for 3 people.  Again, we're not big fans of sweets unless the dessert involves a slice of good tiramisu or cheesecake.  The macaron of the ice cream sandwich is a bit on the sweet side (think Bottega Louie macarons), but it adds the right texture to the soft red velvet ice cream. Next time, I think my mom and I will try the pistachio ice cream in a cup.</text>

FroYo Life is a Montrose hangout. It's super popular on Friday and Saturday night. You'll find a lot of families and teens here.

It's a great snack and healthier alternative to ice cream. There's a dozen different flavors of FroYo and about 2 dozen different toppings from fruit to cookie dough and gummy bears.

On the real tho, FroYo Life... It's 60 degrees outside, night time and you're AC blasting the AC. You know it's freezing right? Don't be like that..</text>

Finally got my butt to this place after years of seeing other people post pictures on FB. Overall...Cool concept. The macaron ice cream sandwiches are cool. A little chewy for my liking however. Since it's cold, it makes the chewy gunk stick to your teeth. I didn't try the infamous blue velvet cake, but it looks disgusting by seeing the amount of dye on that thing.

Tip: Go early. Macaron flavors tend to run out. Don't go after the dinner rush...Wait was ~30min.<//Review>

<Text>Blue Velvet cake-- so moist and not too sweet, made with fresh blueberries. $5/slice and so worth it.

Blood Orange Sorbet-- how could you go wrong? You can't. Nummy nummy! I want more.

<Review>I love ice cream, I also love macarons, so when I discovered this place I knew I had to make a visit!

I had the thai tea macaron ice cream sandwich! It really tasted like thai tea! I guess I didn't expect it to resemble the drink so much but they did a really good job of incorporating the flavor!

My initial bite tasted like heaven, but this baby is big! It was about the size of my palm and by the time I finished half of my sandwich, the whole thing started to get sweeter and sweeter with every bite!

I'm not saying they should be smaller, considering the price I paid, but come prepared with a really big sweet tooth!</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>I would give 5 stars alone for the banana dulce de leche ice cream. It's banana cake with banana ice cream, dulce de leche center, covered in caramel whipped cream rolled in candied almonds and topped with butterscotch. Am I making you salivate yet?

I also got the blue velvet cake, which I find overated. Yes it's different, but it was too sweet for my taste. Perhaps a glass of milk would do. The coffee toffee crunch shake was alright only. It's probably because I'm not a coffee person, but if you are than by all means give it a try.

$3.50 for a scoop of ice cream and $6 for a shake....pricey if you ask me.<//review>< Pics>

I love macarons & I love ice cream! They smashed these treats together perfectly! Hubby & son came here months before & had practically everything on their sweets menu--they raved about it! So for a cool
summer night, we found it fitting to pay MILK a visit. All together, we satisfied our sugar cravings with ice cream macaron sandwiches: Banana Dulce de Leche, Coffee Toffee & Cookies 'N Cream. All were just the right amount of sweetness! You MUST stop by, at least once in your
life :) TIP: Line was out the door, but moving (it took about 15 mins).< /text>

< Review>
macaron ice cream sandwich. I got red velvet and thai tea, I thought the red velet was just ok but the Thai tea was amazing!!! The macaron was crunchy yet also chewy in the middle! Better eat it fast before it melts! Would definitely come back here to get the Thai tea one again! The blue velvet cake is amazing, I've never had anything like it before. The only thing I did not like was that the line moved so slowly just to get to the counter to order!<//Review>

< review>
These ice cream sandwiches are no joke. They're about the size of a fat hockey puck (yep, how Canadian of me to use that for comparison). I've tried the coffee, cookies and cream, red velvet, thai tea, and grasshopper macaron ice cream sandwiches and no, not by myself and not all in one sitting. It was TWO sittings, hah.  Since I'm a mint chocolate chip kinda girl, the grasshopper was my favorite with the thai tea running a close second.

Other desserts that I've sampled at Froyo Life are the blue velvet cake and the strawberry shortcake bar.  The blue velvet cake tasted like red velvet to me and was overall a bit too sweet for my taste. The strawberry shortcake bar was refreshing. I'd probably order this if the grasshopper macaron ice cream was unavailable.

Overall, a perfect destination if you have a sweet tooth.</review>

(Translated by Google) Variety of ice creams with a variety of toppings to accompany. Accessible prices per ounce. Spacious place overlooking the main street. Spacious place to sit and enjoy and offer tasting tests for free. The customer service is regular and not attentive.

Variedad de helados con una gran variedad de toppings para acompanar. Precios accesibles por onzas. Amplio lugar con vista a la calle principal. Espacioso lugar para sentarse a disfrutar y ofrecen  pruebas de sabores gratis. El servicio al cliente es regular y poco atento.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It was a lot of people and the taste was good ... Just a cup is a little expensive.

The ability to reach a local office is gone, that is sad because the 800 support is not helpful nor do they have the ability to actually reach any live person in our local town themselves.  The local drivers and especially the techs are great and I feel sorry for them dealing with us customers.  Please treat them kindly as they too must be having a hard time.<//review>

I can certainly understand how many feel displeased with their customer service. They have moved to using an answering service staffed with personnel all speaking of a foreign accent (I cannot verify but I would certainly bet that it isn't being done in the US). The first call I attempted lasted 2 hrs and 12 minutes. It took about 62 minutes to get to talk to a 'staff member' initially, who after verifying my account details then decided they could not assist me and that they would transfer me to another department. But rest assured it would be an immediate transfer... I kept the phone on speaker and waited some more, at the 2hr12min mark the line hung up. So I called back and again was thrown into a wait for a customer service representative - this time the answering service picked up after ~8 minutes and again verified my account details before deciding they couldn't assist me either and that they would transfer me to another customer representative. Again they assured me it would be an immediate transfer. At the 45 minute marker of the call I was finally able to speak to a representative who spoke English as a first language. She was able to send the region manager notice of our issue and provide feedback to me that we would hear from Amerigas in the next 48 hours. She was able to assist in 2 minutes, so after a total of 2 hours and 59 minutes of phone call (my cell phone logs to prove it) I was finally able to get a confirmation that the local office would reach out to me. Unfortunately customer service is at an all time low...< /text>

I am writing this review while I'm on hold with AmeriGas customer service.  I have been on hold for about an hour now!  And I have been calling to try to deal with this for days--always on hold for a LONG time.  When I called earlier, I was misinformed by a customer service rep.  I told them that we were down to 5% on our 500 gal tank, she said "you should be fine."  Well, we ordered propane over a week ago and now we're down to below 5% and we might run out because they take so long to deliver.  We're on the 7th business day now.  Before I was told it takes 7 to 10 business days for delivery.  They changed that to 7 to 14 business days.   Anyway, they charge an extra $200 for an emergency fill and already their prices are the highest around.  We will be switching to another propane company asap.< /Review>

<time>1614219123346<//time><Review>Bought propane at $1.78 a gallon in October, didn't cut as much wood this year so I used a little more. Usually one delivery a year is sufficient. I started to order online but hesitated at 3.87 per gallon. Called, waited on hold forever, was finally quoted at 3.87 a gallon. Called a competitor that quoted me a current price at 1.92 per gallon. Furthermore, their tank rental is $60 per year versus $120 for Amerigas. This company should be called UnAmerigas! They will not get a penny from me in the future, they can kick rocks. The drivers have always been cool though.</Review></record>

I ran out of propane on automatic delivery even though I called repeatedly for 10 days before I ran out. Then they charged me $4.729 per gallon, more than $2 over the local retail price! I'm a disabled veteran and I'm supposed to get a discounted rate. I've called the call center to dispute my bill, so far only grief. I was on hold with them while typing this up, they just hung up on me. This is really a terrible company times two.<//Text>

First time propane users, propane ran out before Amerigas could refill. We called and the receptionist told us it would be 24 hours max for an 'Emergency refill'. It has now been 4 days with no heat or hot water and I have to be physically present just in case they decide it is a good time to drop in. If someone 18+ is not present when they arrive, they will not fill the tank.

So how do you get groceries or do anything that a life generally requires you to do? Simple, you don't! That's the Amerigas Way!

Amerigas has no means or desire to actually inform you of when your 'Emergency' refill is coming, they will not take your number, text you, or provide any update whatsoever even if you call repeatedly.

Absolutely disgusting.<//Review>

As an Elderly, 100% disabled, low income Senior, and along with others who are trying to pay their bills, buy food & make it thru during this Pandemic, I have been struggling on a day to day basis. I sent a message to Amerigas to let them know that I would need several months to pay my propane bill. When they did not respond, I mistakenly thought that my offer to repay each month had been accepted. I was WRONG. I was then fined a $36 late fee. I completed my original offer & plan to repay my bill as I offered, but another $36 had been charged. I now don't have the extra money to pay these $36 each month (even though my original bill has been paid off). I was told that I hadn't established a "CONTRACT" with this company & so nothing I had told them meant anything. I have now attempted 2 more times to contact the company to establish a pymt plan to pay off the continuing $36 late fee that appears to be continuing on my acct (even though it has already been paid off), with no response to my emails. I have no idea what to do next. I am attempting to do as asked: to establish a "CONTRACT" with this company. Anyone with any suggestions?<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>This company is by far the worst propane company! I contacted them while my husband was in the hospital dying and they wouldn't come out to fill the propane for my home. My family couldn't cook for several days while I was by my husband's side. The company wanted to charge me $4.85 a gallon, plus fees for "emergency" delivery. I had another company out with their tanks within 24 hours and they filled them for $1.99 a gallon!

This company robs people, even when they know they are going through a lot. They charge to pick up their own equipment! Seriously, I should charge you for leaving it here for over a month... where is my storage fee since you took your sweet time picking it up and charging me for it!

Horrible company - Stay away from them... shop around but stay away from this company unless you want to be taken advantage of.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I was a customer with eagle valley propane for over twenty years when amerigas bought them out I thought they would be as good Just found out how wrong I was after getting a bill At $4.99 a gallon I just thought propane had gone way up but the next delivery was the same thing charge over $1400 in three months Only to find out propane hadn't gone up it was just Amerigas taking advantage of me I decided to call ace propane only to find out I could buy propane for $1.99 a gallon These guys are taking advantage of the people that trusted them.</Text>< pics>

They are about double the price of the other propane suppliers, for no real reason.  They want you to be in the Ameri lock program which you have to pay to get into...they quoted me around $130 to become part of that program.  If your not an Ameri lock member they charge over $4.00 per gallon.  The last time I had the tank filled they charged me $4.99 per gallon... other suppliers around the area were approx $3.60  per gal or less.</Text>

The only thing AmeriGas could have done better was to have kept me better informed as to when he was going to show up. He was running late to the point that their office was already closed. The tech did call when he was enroute to the job but it turned out to be a long day for both of us. I should add that the way he completed the job was worth the wait.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I have lived on propane for nearly 30 years. I've heard lots of complaints and have had many of my own over that time but I have had positive experiences with AmeriGas in Grass Valley.  They have always worked with me. Laura and Jeff, Thank you !!</text>

I, as well like another reviewer stated, am very dissatisfied with the customer service and the price gauging!! I have been a customer with them for over 10 years, pretty good service most of those years but in the last few years they have increased the tank rentals and the price per gallon significantly, and I understand cost go up but when I called 3 other local propane companies there is a $1.00-$2.00 difference, AND the tank rental is about $40.00 less per year.  I don't know about you but with cost of living higher these days every penny counts!! Also, the customer service has been getting worse...when I first inquired about the price per gallon, the person stated " yes, it's winter.".. Thanks I am well aware!! That's when I decided to take my business elsewhere!! As of today, I have been trying to get ahold of them to close out my account...called about 4-5 times, placed on hold, then hung up on me!!! WOW!!!
So to other locals you might try calling around!!< /Review>

<Review>AmeriGas in Grass Valley has probably the worst customer service I have EVER experienced in my entire life. Firstly, I had chosen amerigas as my propane provider under the guise that they were going to honor competitive pricing beyond the first year of service. However, after one year with them the cost of my propane DOUBLED, within a year and a half it nearly TRIPLED.  When I called to examine why the cost had risen so much I was met with a tremendous amount of rudeness and complete lack of care about customer satisfaction. The representative, Stephanie, even hung up on me when she said she was putting me on hold. I have never written a bad review for anything but their pettiness and complete lack of professionalism has propelled me to do so.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Buyer beware! An Amerigas tank was in place when we bought our house, so we kept the service. We were away for an extended trip, so we weren't using utilities. Then we received an invoice for the same amount as the prior invoice. When I called about it, I was told that I'd been charged $3.78/gal, but should have been charged $2.99/gal. I started calling other suppliers and found that their charge per gallon was significantly lower. At the time, other companies in my area were charging about $1.91 / gal.

Also, the annual tank rental for Amerigas is $106.55. The company I changed to charges $64 per year.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

While I was EXTREMELY disappointed that I ran out of propane, I was very happy that Amerigas sent someone out the very night I called to fill the tank.< /Text>

<text>SB Tire and Service Center put new wheels on my 4Runner and installed my Toytec BOSS suspension system. Both times the guys at SB Tire and Service Center did great work. They were thorough and had my car ready timely. Very professional service and top-notch work. They also did a great job keeping me up to date on the progress of my vehicle as well as making sure I came back for a re-check after the initial work was completed. I felt like my vehicle was in trustworthy hands, I’ll for sure take my car here in the future. Thanks guys!< /text><date>1606030833293< /date><name>Megan Swann<//name>< rate>

Everyone at SB Tire Service were very nice and very helpful. Went in thinking I needed a new tire since my tire had a nail in it.
They told me they can patch it instead.
Such great news and saved me tons of money
. They were honest and very efficient.
I highly recommend them!< /text>

< review>
I waited around 6 weeks after my work was done to write this review because I wanted to make sure it was accurate. I brought my Honda Odyssey in for A/C repair work. Everything was going great until I needed one additional part. This part was on national backorder due the major shipping stoppages from Covid-19 from overseas. The biggest cost with A/C work is usually labor. It takes time and a specialized mechanic to do the work. Long story short SB Tire worked with me after I was able to find the part. The part was far away and needed time to get to Santa Barbara. After it arrived they were able to assemble everything perfectly and my A/C has never been better. Most places would have just sealed the hvac back up and charged me again for reopening it when the part arrived. This probably saved me around 1k. I would definitely recommend SB Tire. They are honest and do quality work at a very reasonable price. They also will go out of their way to try and save you money if the opportunity arrives. Props to them!< /review>

Amazing customer service from very pleasant and helpful staff.

I had to drive a long way on my spare (long story) and simply went in to ask their opinion on the quality of the spare. Not only was their advice very helpful, but they insisted on re-torquing the lug nuts and checking the tire pressure, and refused to take any payment for it.

I'll certainly make a point of stopping by here next time I'm in the area and need tire work done!<//review>

<review>The power window on my vehicle stopped working. I searched online and called Santa Barbara tires. Anabel answer the phone and was friendly and knowledgeable and was able to get me in right away. Cecilio, the manager was able to diagnose the problem, get the part I needed and I have it all installed in hours. I’m grateful that I did not have to leave my vehicle open overnight and the whole repair cost less than if I had gone to the dealership for the same repair.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Convenient location and friendly knowledgeable people.  Have always been able to get work scheduled within a reasonable time factor.  Have taken all 3 of my vehicles here and all have been ready as promised or even earlier time wise with the work done satisfactorily.<//review>

<text>Out standing experience, took my car in there without an appointment, had it up on the rack in less than 30 minutes and was out the door with a 40.00 patch job, and a great cup of coffee. Guys there were awesome,  they said i didn't need a new tire, and the whole experience was great. Highly recommend.< /text>< Date>

<Review>My family has been getting our cars serviced at SB Tire and Service for over 20 years. The service is outstanding and everyone the the SB Tire and Service team works hard to make sure your car is running properly. Unlike other car service shops, I know I’m getting an honest deal and that my car is in great hands. I highly recommend!</Review>< pics>

Junior, Omar, and the rest of the team are incredible. I have gotten tires and breaks for both my Range Rover and my Land Rover LR4. Not only have they provided incredible service. They have also been very competitive in pricing. You combine that with honesty and reliability and you have a winning combo. For any service and an honest opinion, this is the best spot in town.<//review>

My experience here was terrible. I have a SB Axxess card that offers 50% off oil changes with an appointment, so I made one a few days in advance. When I got there, they said the promotion does not apply to diesels, even though that is not mentioned in the offer. I asked how much it would be without the discount and they quoted me 50% more than what I'm used to paying around town.

Santa Barbara Tire and Service Center is overpriced and did not honor their promotion. I felt disrespected and lied to because of these poor business practices.<//Text>

Junior is the best. I wanted to lift my Jeep with a lift kit, tires and wheels and Junior gave me spot-on advice, he was patient with me, and helped me understand my options. Junior gave me a great price, a high quality instillation, and it was completed in a timely manner. I highly recommend Santa Barbara Tire and Service.<//text>

Don't do it.... overpriced, try to sell you parts that are not needed and use scare tactics if the repair is declined. Leave cars in the red zone to be ticketed and don't take responsibility for the ticket. Won't cover things they break in the course of their repair but instead make you buy the part and charge for install. No warranties covered instead try to tell you that because the brakes are bad the muffler has to be replaced... some kind of bs story.< /Text>

They are always really nice and fully explain any question or concern I have. Even if it's super busy they take the time to not only answer but make sure you fully understand everything. They will help narrow down what is truly needed and what can wait- something I greatly appreciate because I live paycheck to paycheck. Other places have made things seem dire and almost scared me into doing things I couldn't afford. That doesn't happen here. I'm stressing the honesty thing because I'm a girl that doesn't know much about cars and I've been taken advantage of before. I keep coming back because I really do trust them to not sugarcoat or embellish anything just to make a sale.<//Review>

< review>
They charged me over $100 to diagnose even though I told them that the alternator was bad when I brought it in. Didn't matter, they still had to hook up a volt meter and check which takes less than 10 minutes and I get charged $120? Then, they massively mark the part up which I had to pay because I had no ride to the auto parts store. Then they charge for 2 hours of labor for an alternator which I could have done myself if I had the tools in a half hour. All in all cost me about $600 for an alternator. Avoid these guys. They are crooks.</review>

<Text>Buying tires should be easy...at SB Tire it is.No hidden charges,tires in stock,no trying to switch me to a different tire, out of there in a reasonable amount of time .At Sears the exact opposite happened.Next time straight to SB Tire.< /Text><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

Brought my vehicle in to replace a ball joint.   It took them less than 4.5 hours for the work and was charged for 7.    @ $110 an hour I felt a bit robbed.   Also had to bring the vehicle back twice within the first 24 hours for issues related to the repair.   I don't plan on going back.<//Review>

<Text>This was my first experience renting a storage unit. From the beginning, Elliot was so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  I feel as though I had all of the information to make an informed decision on the specific unit I needed.

The price is competitive for what you're getting especially with their discounts. More importantly, besides the good pricing, Elliot has provided excellent customer service every interaction I've had with him, whether by telephone or in person.

Without a doubt, I recommend Mission Hills Self Storage if you ever need a storage unit - and ask for Elliot :-)<//Text><name>Nina - Dawn<//name>< resp>

The manager is ignorant have poor listening skills. Amanda is good at understanding what is going on with the unit. The manager was telling me I said one thing when Amanda heard me say exactly what I said. He heard something completely different from what I said. So for his lack of customer skills I rate them poorly.<//Text>

< Review>
Just got a storage space here and the staff was very helpful, kind and understanding. I was not sure what size I really needed and they asked me questions to determine what was the best size for my needs.  I had no clue and they made it easy. Mission Hills Storage was recommended to me by my daughter, she told me the prices were great and the staff was helpful and she was right.  Will recommend to other family members and friends.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Jay and Cesar are awesome!!! Clean and convenient. Was offered a great deal for an awesome storage space. Air conditioned units available. Wish I had an air conditioned unit. Easily accessible. Close to the 405/5 and 118 junction. You can buy boxes here and they have a restroom available. They have specials available for certain units, based on availability. Better value than Self Storage. Clean and very accessible. Access to the units are from M-Sat 9am-5:30p and closed on Sundays. Boxes, locks and tape available for purchase at the office. New move ins can use the moving truck available. As of ohhh now, no new move ins. Ask for details.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Mission Hills Self Storage was a blessing for us when we really needed them. We have been loyal customers for way to long! LOL However, if there is anywhere that I would trust pretty much my entire life with I would have to say this place is number one on my list!
Thank you guys for always being such a great help!

Ramone and Liz were great! The process was easy and fast. They were kind & helped me to understand the policies and procedures. And this place is so CLEAN! Lol. The alarm system is regularly attended to which makes me feel secure in storing my things here.< /Text>

<Text>Absolutely clean facility! Great staff and easy to deal with. They are a little more expensive then most storage facilities BUT you definetely get 5 star service, no bugs, accommodating staff and a well kept facility for the $$. The staff is friendly (Liz is my favorite) and management (Melinda and Ramon) are very accommodating! I've been storing at MHSS for over 10 years and have never had a problem!< /Text>< pictures>

They were professional and polite and Ramon was so cool he told me all about their social media offers where u can leave reviews on yelp and and like them on Facebook and they give u a discount every time u do it. I was really happy because storage is really expensive me and the savings will help me out all. Thank u Ramon! You are really funny helpful and nice. U did everything you could to help me save money and get me all those social media discounts.

Not too busy and the staff was helpful. They were also informative even though it was obvious I wasn't getting a full set of tires. Kudos to them for being covid safe.</Text>

Wud never give this location my business.  Called on a Saturday for a price after getting a flat and salesman Dan said he would not match a price that another Goodyear location gives to me. Started laughing and says no way I can give you that price. I was shocked. I've been going to Goodyear on Winchester Blvd for over 7 years now. Horrible customer service. Then Dan calls me back 30 minutes later and says he can order the tire and have it sent to my location that I frequent. However my car was at Wheelworks already getting a tire. What an experience with Dan. Dont go here. Go to the Winchester location and they know how to take care of life long customers. I work in retail so price matching is a big thing. I had just bought 2 new tires for my challenger 2 months ago and Dan couldn't match that price. SMH. What a crock.<//Text>

The service here was fast and reliable, the guys at the front are extremely friendly. I had to stay an extra few hours due to some extensive service they did and they all went through the entire process with me, giving me price options throughout the entire time. Never once did I feel I didn't get my money's worth. Really nice people.</Review>

I called and went in for a patch on one of my tires that was leaking air. Dan was very polite and helpful on the phone  and said come on down. I get there and give him my information they print out an invoice and everything will be done for free no charge. As I'm waiting they have a nice little guest area where you can watch TV, make complimentary coffee or take a free water bottle inside a mini fridge.
I would definitely drive out of my way again to get service done at this location.</Text>

<Review>First off just avoid this location ALL together and go to the one a couple blocks down. This location lacks customer service to a totally different degree. I had called on the phone stating I was on my way unaware there was 2 locations so close. (Just moved here) I came in needing a repair on my Jeep. I had stated I just called and explained what I needed. I got a glare and an eyeroll and was told to go down the street they can assist me there. A gentleman came in right after me and was assisted immediately. I've been told since I've been to this location that they're racist and that would make sense from my experience. I went to the other location and 100% would recommend over this one.<//Review>< userid>

<rate>5</rate><Text>This is the second time I’ve come here. The first was several months ago, my previous vehicle (with fairly new tires) got a nail in the tire. It hadn’t gone flat yet but it was only a matter of time before it did and since it was the closest tire place near my job I gave them a call, they told me to bring it in and they were able to patch it in about an hour free of charge (as long as the tire is in good condition with decent tread and the damage is within a certain area of the tire) it didn’t matter that I didn’t purchase my tires from them. So they patched everything up and sent me on my way. They didn’t try to upsell me anything or convince me I needed stuff done that I didn’t need. So fast forward to today I came out to a flat fire (nail in brand new tires) and it was no question, I called Goodyear and they were able to take care of my car right away. Again I hadn’t purchased these tires from them and again they didn’t charge. I’m inclined to bring my vehicles back to them when needed and I’d definitely recommend Goodyear to a friend.</Text>< pics>

<response>None</response><text>The Customer service center forced store manager Sir Charles to honor the warranty I have on my four tires after he refused my request initially. To retaliate at me, it took him seven days to get the tires in which are standard sizes. (225/45/17 eagle)I had to call customer service again to call them and only then they acknowledged my tires arrived though I was calling the store everyday. I called few local Good Year stores and all told me if tires are not in stock they will be in next day.
I went today to get the tires installed, but they added $114 alignment to my bill without my approval. They told me if I don’t agree to pay for alignment which they didn’t start, they will not sell me the tires so I left without the tires.
This manager has a lot to learn and must leave his attitude at home by serving his  customers who  put food on his table. No wonder why his store has barely any customers!</text><rate>1< /rate>< date>

I specifically asked them to check my 12v battery as I had been having intermittent trouble starting my car and the clock would reset every time I turned it off. They said they would check it. They said everything was fine with the car. I asked again about the battery, they insisted it was in perfect condition. I am a full time uber driver and depend upon my car for my income. Sure enough ten days later I'm stuck on the side of the road with passengers in my car - angry at me - with a battery so dead my road side assistance could not read anything resembling a charge from the 12v.

I also know that they didn't bother to check the battery because it's not located under the hood like normal cars. I have a hybrid and the 12v is under the rear seat. After they claimed to have checked it the seat and seat covers had not been moved. I put my seat covers on in a very specific way - so they stay put. Mechanics and road side assistance would never put them back on completely as it involves strategically maneuvering four pieces of Velcro while simultaneously having two people stretch the neoprene and using panel tools to secure the 6 tabs.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I bought some tires for my PT cruiser that came with a lifetime warranty 4 years ago.

I asked when I invested in these tires about the warranty is 'My life time, the lifetime of the car, or the lifetime of the tires'.

They said 'lifetime of the car' as long as the tire tread is not worn out.

My wife took her tires just  to be rotated and an oil change.

They found the sidewalls of all the tire is beginning to split.

She only has about 10,000 miles on the tires.

He said that she should replace the tires because now they are not safe anymore and said the lifetime warranty does not cover this!

Furthermore, even with road hazard warranty, they refused to remove a nail from the tire!

This service station is trying to screw us!

This is end of a lifetime customer!<//Text>< Pics>

Regrettable experience.  Went in for standard oil change and asked them to honor a Goodyear wide alignment check and clean my throttle body.  My car was returned to me in lesser condition than when I dropped it off and they refused to honor my alignment coverage.  Went back to check if the throttle body had been cleaned and needless to say, it hadn't.  Charged me for services not performed and refused to honor a Goodyear service product.  Will not be returning to this location and do not recommend.< /text>

< Review>
This is on behalf of Aldeir Soto. I must say that he does a remarkable job representing FitnessSF. He does his absolute best to provide customer service. He really knows how to connect/ maintain his connections with other members in a professional way. 10/10 would recommend if interested in personal training. This is the man to go to if you want to see results and need your life lit up!! Keep up the great work man.< /Review>

Management is completely rude and money-thirsty. I called to re-activate my account that was canceled over two years ago. I was told over the phone that booking a lane for lap swimming was easier and that between 1pm and 3pm swimming for an hour was not going to be an issue, he even said “I guarantee” since I have some issues with my back I was advised by my doctor to swim. I explained over the phone that I was not interested neither able to do anything but lap pool.

But when I actually showed up to swim, after they charged my card with first and last month (I wasn’t even told that they were going to charge me for last month which is a higher fee than first month for some unknown reason) the reality was completely different. They don’t offer online or phone reservations for the pool. You must show up and and is just for half hour. The pool is indoor and not windows are open so I’m not sure they are in compliance with covid-19 protocols.

I immediately felt off, I did 20 minutes of swimming and I left. I went to Crunch Yerba Buena two days latter and they have outdoor pool with the ability to reserve a lane over the phone 24 hours ahead or same day for ONE hour. Membership is cheaper, you can change in the bathroom and they provide swimming robes so you don’t walk around in your swimming suit, etc. I called Fitness SF to cancel since they really are not offering what I was told. Their general manager Mr. Kevin Williams took the call after a long wait and told me from the start of the call that they don’t refund memberships after five days. I got upset since I did not sign any contract, they did not email me the terms and conditions (the fine print) and it was 8 days that have passed and only one visit after my card was charged.

I emailed the VP Mr. Don Dickerson, condemning such predatory practices and rude treatment and the response was a personal attack. I have never been treated so poorly in my life. I’m taking the time to write this in the hopes that others don’t have to go through this. Like other reviews here warned they are going to rip you off and treat you badly if you dare to complain. Be aware.</Text>

<Response>{'time': 1619728087345, 'text': 'Hi Karina, Thank you for the review. Upon joining, all members pay a prorated first month + a full last month and we do have a 5 day cancel policy. All of our terms and conditions are available to the public via our website. Every attempt to solve the situation was made, even after accusing our General Manager of being "racist" over the phone. Claiming "rude treatment" goes both ways when calling someone from our staff racist without any context.'}< /Response><gmapID>0x808580b99da6c413:0x83cc495233220313< /gmapID></record>

My first class a woman fell and hurt her ankle but because the instructor was all the way on the other side of the class it took her a while to even notice...and that was with us trying to call her over. REGARDLESS, it's a great place with so much potential. I don't recommend beginners just starting to get into fitness, but definitely people who know a bit more about form until they get that part straightened out.</Text>

Probably one of the best gyms I've been to.... Especially considering the small size. The staff is always pleasant, and despite small size of the men's locker room, it's kept clean. They have one of the best selections of ab machines, and have a really wide selection of other machines. If you like weights, they have plenty of weight racks. the pool rarely gets so crowded that you have to swim more than two people to a lane. I wish they would make the hot tub hotter, sometimes it's okay but a lot of times it's just not hot enough. FYI, they recently closed the steam room in the men's locker room to increase the size of the men's locker room, which makes having a hot hot tub even more important!<//Text>

<text>Literally the best gym in SF!! Previous equinox member and this place tops it by 10000! I’ve shopped around looking for the perfect gym (price, updated equipment, attention to detail, separate rooms for certain equipment, month to month etc.) and I finally found the perfect one. Everyone is so friendly and inviting, very clean, amazing equipment that really shows that they pay attention to modern gym influencers and all. They even have a “jungle” gym which is so great you can never get bored of your workouts/ you can get very creative.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Social distancing makes a a third of the machines unavailable. Locker rooms, showers, steam room, and sauna also unavailable.  Steam room will soon be remodeled into more showers.< /Review>

<text>Very disappointing. Time to stop saying you're like a spa. After years of going here and enjoying all the amenities, even though it looks like you're entering someone's basement, they close the steam room without telling anyone. No notices posted anywhere, no emails to clients, only a surly staff member who curtly said, "It's closed. Take it up with management." I did do that only to get a response that they needed more shower room and maybe I should think about joining another gym. Wow, way to treat your clientele, guys! Also the sauna room is soon scheduled to close, but, no surprise, nobody knows why or when. Most of the staff just raise their hands and say, "Got me." I thought maybe it was a cost operations issue, but they're making money hand over fist with their new rates and limited things they offer. I gave it a single star because most of the machines work and most of the time you can find a mat and bolster to stretch. But, if it's crowded, that's pretty much out of the picture.</text><Response>{'time': 1565119648478, 'text': "Hello Allen, we appreciate your feedback.

<Review>I have always enjoyed coming to this gym. It has the feeling of a spa, and is very relaxing, and rarely overcrowded. Wonderful staff and equipment.  I have to say it is disappointing that they are removing the steam room to put in (needed) extra showers. This was the only branch of Fitness SF left that still had a steam room.  I used it for its therapeutic benefits, as well as the fantastic hot tub (please please don’t remove it). I understand that these facilities require constant maintenance, but it was a major reason I often choose Fillmore over the other facilities, all of which I can walk to. I hope the trend to remove amenities doesn’t continue- not a reassuring sign.</Review>< pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Been a member for over a year, great gym but they are removing gym services while increasing rates - please reconsider. This does not make sense and will not be any new value.

I don’t understand why their is a raise in rates and a decrease in services. I just moved back to SF and got a membership again, Fillmore is the only gym that has a sauna out of all the gyms and I use the wet sauna which is now “closing”. Dry saunas are way too harsh for my rosacea prone skin. Is Fitness Sf planning to remove all the saunas ? My recommendation is to get a infared sauna, this is the least irritating and is 100x more effective for gym users for recovery and sweating. I’m very upset that none of the locations have saunas except one which is now closing the brands only wet sauna. Competitors have this service included without additional costs. When a company raises rates and removes benefits and services is a very bad sign, this does no value for members. Focus on improving and adding services which can be a better ask for price adjustments, not because their are new gyms in locations customers will never use - that’s your investment, not what existing customers are willing to invest for.

If your a new customer I would strongly consider this, a gym who starts removing services once will do it again in order to be more “profitable” by getting more people in. Why not position your brand as more service oriented and increase rates? Not volume. This isn’t a 24 hour fitness, ironically they do have saunas and are half the price and have more customers, probably because they have a sauna and many more services not less....

If Fitness SF changes their decision I would gladly remove this post.</review>< pictures>

Worst customer service. I tried to cancel my membership in November and they apparently don't teach their staff how to do it properly? I stopped getting charged so I assumed it had been cancelled but I suddenly got a 350 dollar charge months later in January from fitness sf. I contacted them by phone and they we're extremely defensive and uninterested in helping. They then told me to complain by email. No one responded to my email for days and when they finally did, they didn't address the issue of a sudden charge of 350 dollars. All they said was that my membership had never been cancelled and that I "can enjoy the gym until Feb 28". I replied again wanting to know why they stopped charging me if my membership was never cancelled and then they suddenly decided to charge in January. No response yet.</Text>

Went all the way cross city to this sf fitness location to use the pool and hot tub and left utterly disappointed. They no longer provide rental locks for your locker so you either have to bring your own or buy one. Steam sauna in men’s room is undergoing renovations so only the dry one is open. I got changed and within 10 minutes of arriving and starting warm ups the entire gym was closed due to an isolated pipe leak. They kicked everyone out and closed the gym. Beyond annoying, especially after traveling a far ways and purchasing a lock just to use this facility. Workout space is cramped and awkwardly spaced out. Ceilings are low so it feels more like a dungeon. Only upside is the friendly staff and pool/hot tub facilities.< /review>
<response>{'time': 1576024810481, 'text': "Hey Maclean, we are sorry you had a negative experience. The pipe leak was an unfortunate occurrence that was completely out of our control.

Overall the gym was nice. I like the location, machines, weights, classes, pool, and personal training sessions.

You may want to negotiate membership price and will get some significant discount from their listed price.

The only thing missing is kickboxing classes which I’d love to do.

When we signed up we effectively have paid for the last month. So remember to give notice 2 months before ending.< /review>

The classes are great and there are many options to choose from throughout the week. If you enjoy dance fitness, this location is especially staffed with the best Zumba instructors. Try out Tricio's classes--they are super fun and give you a great sweat! Staff and management are also ultra friendly and lively!</review>

When are you guys going to fix the internet? It’s like a dungeon. neither no service nor internet at all. What takes so long if just a few signal extender can solve the problem? ——UPDATE: yes internet is very important at the gym and thank you for the satire. The gym is at a basement and there is no service, and the internet is on and off. I would like to listen music or use fitness app on my phone, so answer is YES.

I have been a member of this gym on and off for the last 4 years. The reason I am giving it two stars is because lately, I have been going to the steam room and openly witnessing hand-jobs and then the same people going into the shower together. This is beyond allowable, and it frustrates me greatly. One of the main reasons I go to this gym is the pool, hot-tub, and steam room. NO longer.< /Text>

<review>It's ok because they do have a good amount of equipment and they validate the parking but nearly always something is broken and out of use including showers. Often a wait to get in the shower on on some exercise machines at peak workout times. The janitorial staff appears to never have been trained on how to clean. They work hard, but using the same dirty tag to wipe down everything is just gross,  and the towels always have stains.

<review>Could be a good gym, but it's almost always plagued by broken stuff. Showers, steam room, weight equipment, garage validation, etc. Can also get dirty. There seems to be no staff going around to keep things clean / operational.<//review><rating>3< /rating><user_id>118399865522828370109<//user_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< Time>

I hate exercise and have to make myself do it, but the Fillmore crew makes coming to the gym almost easy. Also, the people who work out here keep to themselves and are neither chatty nor judgey, and even at busy times I can always find a treadmill or rowing machine. My only minuses are I don’t like the mass-market music and the spotty WiFi means I have to download my own music to my phone at home instead of streaming it but the super staff and clean facilities are the most important to me and they are great.</text><user_id>116869684811880435339<//user_id>< gmap_id>

<text>Been going here back since it was Fillmore One. New ownership with SF Fitness has definitely improved the cleanliness and quality. Lots more busy, but can still sneak in early morning. Pool is a nice touch although at almost any hour expect a bit of a wait - gets hectic with little queing system to get in and some resistance to 3+ lane swimming. Overall a solid place to get some workouts in.<//text>< gmapID>

<Text>They have swimming pool, all kind of weights, bands, stretching room, steam room, sauna, locker (bring your own lock).  In case you don't have lock or swimming equipment like cap and goggles (no swimming suit).They also have protein bars, milkshakes and t-shirt.

The Fitness SF, Fillmore branch is my favorite gym in the city. The reason why is partly because of the gym features but mostly because of the people and the sense of community there.

The gym itself is modern, clean, and has all the equipment I need, including a pool, sauna and hot tub! There are many weekly classes available, and the gym's hours are reasonable. The trainers, however, are top-notch! They are always friendly, welcoming, and helpful. I've worked with Juancho, Rodrigo, and others there. They are all great!

Juancho teaches and trains TRX classes and one-on-one training sessions. His focus is core and full-body movement. After a couple classes with him, I am toned in a way that I cannot get to on my own -- he really pushes me to the next, well, next few levels. It's hard work but totally pays off. He's really good at catering a session to your needs and level. He also listens very well to me which I appreciate.

Rodrigo is much more focused on strength, and specific and particular areas of your body that needs a boost. I've worked with him on a couple one-on-one training sessions and thought he was a great trainer. Like Juancho, he also pushed  me to new limits. He has a very encouraging attitude which I find helpful and he's given me good tips that have been very useful.

Both of these guys are so positive and upbeat, it's great to work with them. I would like to work with them more. I would recommend them to anyone looking to strengthen and tone. I'd also recommend just about any trainer at the Fitness SF, Fillmore branch. It's a good place train and a great community.< /review>

<text>My first time started out great - until I asked a trainer "Doug" if this was the best place to swing a kettlebell... he proceeded to be grumpy and give me a hard time. Was told thats not usual. Place is nice except the steam room is consistently nasty... locker room needs an updating. Equipment is decent. Rodrigo is an incredible trainer however - ask for him.< /text>< user>

<review>A solid neighborhood gym. They have a pool and olympic weight lifting facilities. Fitness SF has other locations around the area that are much larger and nicer, but this one suits for the biweekly weight lifting workout. It does get busy during peak evening hours and on Saturday afternoons.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The weight room is laid out so poorly it's no wonder it only takes 10 people to make it feel crowded. This gyms only saving grace is the pool. Expect a pile of trash if you want to lift any sort of weight.< /Text>

I've been going to this gym since the 1990's, paying dues religiously since (probably $20k in total) over 3 ownerships.  FitnessSF has really brought the club downhill.  The showers are always broken.  The swim suit spinner is always broken.  The shower outside pool used to be warm, now cold.  They removed carpets from the dressing rooms.  They replaced the normal towels with tiny dishtowel size ones, which they also don't clean as well.  They don't provide towels in the locker rooms, so they will only give you 2 at the front desk.  If you forget, or need one after undressing or in swim suit, you have to parade through the entire gym to the front desk to get another towel.

To top it off, they just increased dues by 17% and when I wrote to inquire about the increase, they cancelled my membership with no further interaction or confirmation from me.  Their Dir of Operations, Don Dickerson, appears to have had a real negative impact on the club (apparently, just short term view on numbers).

Check out the alternatives like USF Koret for awesome pool, and even public pools like Rossi or Mission pools.</Text>

<review>Great amenities here. Next time im im the area, ill come back. The only annoyance is how spread out everything is. If youre not use to this gym, i would take some time to explore it first. But, the parking is ample and safe for a place in the city.

P.s: dont crumble up thw parking ticket or you will have a tough time leaving the garage.<//review>< Pictures>

The only place that would shut down to remodel only to look more dated and ugly. Losing services every month. Not gay friendly.</Review>

Very friendly, knowledgeable technicians. I had window tinting done. They are reasonably priced and they did the job fast, while I waited. There's an outdoor waiting area.< /Text>

This location has always been bad, they don’t treat their customers with respect. Prices are too high and their work ethics are terrible. If you’re planning on tinting your windows here, DO NOT COME! These guys don’t care about you or your car, all they care about is your money. Stay way from this shop and go look for another one!<//review>

<Text>Real bad customer service an appointment is needed apparently but honestly I don't see what the point of an appointment is if when you get there on time for your appointment and you still have to wait over 30 mins to get your car worked on. I had a 3pm appointment but had to wait 45 extra minutes for them to get to my car. I was told that I couldn't wait at their storefront for my car I had a face mask on so I'm sure it wasn't because of that although there were like 3 people waiting for their cars and one customer  was walking around their work area so not sure why they told me I couldn't wait for my car right outside especially after waiting almost an hour for them to get to my car. Tint came out nice though so if you don't value good customer service and just want to get your windows tinted I would say this place is for you. Probably won't be coming back unless there's a problem with my tint.<//Text>< Pictures>

Okay, I give these guys five stars because they are super cool and they have lots of stuff. Their prices are very reasonable but they do the cheapest crappiest swap meet hack job type of work. I should take a picture. It does not look like a professional installed it because well I think they're hiring the homeless here. Anyways it worked for now</Text>

Great place with a winning business system! It's like a machine...no need for appointments; pull up, and PAY and then, get it all done. Tinted windows & Sound system... that's what I call getting to the MONEY. I'm happy, the company is happy...win/win.<//review>

Did the bait and switch and was charged another 100.00. Alarm was installed in the wrong location with relays just laying everywhere and wires out in the open. Alarm could of been defeated easily in a second. They wrapped a bunch of wires in a roll of electrical tape and now I know why. I took the tape off and what a big mess! Wires wrapped around other wires. A hot wire with 4 other wires tied into it in 4 different spots. A bright YELLOW wire for the horn drooping along the outside of the kickpad out in the open.   Used a cheap bypass not a quality one.  Looks like 3 different people worked on it. One neat job with a fine solder and tape job then a terrible tape job already unraveling (week old) then some squeeze connectors on some other wires. I ended up fixing and cleaning up the wires. Adding wire to tie up in one location and moving all the wires out of reach. Bolting down the relay so they don't rattle around. No longer looks like a mess of wires going every which way but neat and organized and hard to disable. 689.00 hit to the wallet had it overnight and took me a few days to make it right< /text>

Tint wasn't done right wouldn't stick to metrix on window and they didn't know why???? And my stereo they put in already is making a funny sound like it is shorting out or the ground is touching something oh and my speaker blew in the back seat. I guess 900 hundred dollars was to cheap for a good job. Thanks.<//Text>

< review>
Great customer service!! Staff is very helpful answering any questions you might have as well as trying to find the best rate or discount for their customers. Location is right off 101 so that was also a plus. The units and grounds are kept clean. Never had an issue with pests either.
Thankful that staff walks the grounds to check unit locks. I had an incident where I forgot to properly lock my unit and was contacted immediately.) However; I had forgot to update my info..) staff checked the cameras.. and replaced my lock at no cost. When I returned the next time to my storage unit they had notified me of what had happened. Very Important: always update your info!! Luckily nothing was stolen.
I've rented a couple units from Extra Space and would again in the future if needed.< /review>

The company was proactive in getting me into a unit I was waiting for. Jessica’s customer service is stellar, and the property is clean, well kept, and mostly quiet. Based on word of mouth and personal experience, this is the best place in town for security and convenience.< /Text>

Friendly customer service, clean storage, and great communication!

It's stressful enough to relocate during a pandemic. We so appreciate that renting a storage unit has been a breeze with Extra Space Storage.

We were having a little trouble finding our unit, but someone came out to help us right away. She was super friendly and helpful!< /Text>

I love this storage facility!!! Working with the on-site manager, Setha, has been consistently quality service, the few times I've had an issue, the problem was handled as quickly as humanly possible. I've been a renter here for a few years now and this is the only facility that I ever refer anyone to and I tell all my friends- best bang-for-your-buck all the way around!!!</Review>

I have used this ExtraSpaceStorage several times over the years, due to various moves. For several years I kept large original painting in the climate controlled section, and more recently some belongings in another section. I have never had a problem. The place is clean, very well maintained and well managed. Both the manager, Sita, and asst. manager, Jessica are professional, always helpful, and friendly. I’ve recommended others to store things there as well. All have had good experiences. Thank for such great service.</Text>

They price gouge big time. I started at $240 and was up to $400 within three years. I came in to have some guys pickup a donation I was giving. I went into the front office and the wiseguy said he bet he could get $500 for the unit. The only good part was none of my stuff got stolen.<//Review>

The folks in the office are great, just absolutely friendly and helpful. I've switched storage units a few times this year (upsizing and downsizing as needs changed when I relocated my shop) and each time they've arranged to pro-rate the rent and set me up quickly.

Jessica and her team made our cross country move very very easy!

We had the difficulty of using storage pods to move our house units from Chicago to SF, and the company we used gave us a five day range of when the pods were going to show up. I was stressing that they would get rejected at the place, but I told Jessica about it and she was able to get them placed right by our container. We got there later that day and got the pods unloaded without a synch!

Very glad that we went with this storage place. Definitely recommend them!< /Review>

I never write reviews but I had such a positive experience with this place I had to share :)The customer service is top notch not to mention v affordable rates. They filled me figure out the dimensions I would need as well as letting me borrow a lock bc I had forgotten mine. The employees are the nicest and most helpful people 🙏 the place is immaculate and conveniently located and it’s a great deal so you really can’t go wrong. Moving is stressful but picking a storage unit doesn’t have to be! I highly recommend!< /text>

< Review>
Updates: The "first month free" banner is still up and I have left the facility. My price increased once.

Overall a pretty pleasant experience. I was assisted by Mark who showed me the unit. Up front he disclosed there would be mandatory insurance added on top of the unit fee, and the website disclosed the one time admin fee, so there were no hidden fees by the time I signed the contract/lease. He even warned me ahead of time that the rent would most likely increase in approximately 5 months.

I do have a couple of concerns that lie with the company and its owner. When you drive up, there is a large banner stating "first month free", and upon mentioning it to the employees I am told that this promo is no longer active and they are not allowed to take the banner down. Blatant fishing and false advertisement. Next, I don't know how the units are measured, but I'm renting a 5x5 and when I think that, I think 5 wide x 5 deep. I'm 5'3" and if I were to lie down in the unit I would stick out about halfway. It's more like 2.5 x 2.5.

The prices are a bit high because they take full advantage of the high demand for storage. Based on that I will probably leave the facility before the price goes up.</Review>

The staff is helpful, don’t get sucked in to the low price to open a storage. I started a indoor 10x10 storage thinking $149.00 was a bargain. Over a couple of years it jumped to $212.00. I only have household items stored from a recent move. When I went to pick up a couple of items, there was tons of rat droppings & urine on my items. Boxes chewed through and nest in shelves. When I reported it to the office, there response was, I can give you a couple of boxes and vacuum the droppings.  Shop around and don’t get caught up in their move in price.< /text>

Great convenient hours to get into my storage unit early or late.

I also like the convenience of being near the 101 and the street it is located on is spacious and easy to get back into the main road.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>We had been stuck in India from the Co-vid crisis and needed to move out of our former storage unit because they were doubling the price....many storage units would not take us unless we appeared live (which was not possible for us)...Extra Space Storage worked with us and helped us move out of our old storage and save a lot of money....</review>< Gmap_id>

<review>The storage space is good.  I believe the one on Hearn Ave. has the only climate-controlled storage in Santa Rosa.  But I'm eating them so low because they u create their prices 10% OR MORE every 9 months.  I'm a long-time customer, and they used to roll back their increases to just 1-3% when I asked, but lately they won't.  It's gotten really expensive! But the company just doesn't care.</review>< pics>

yes very nice people BUT beware, they just raised the rate $40./month which is 10% after only moving in 4 months ago. We didnt get advance notice or the choice to lock in the whole year at the original rate. feels like a slimy bait and switch.< /Review>

<Review>Amazing! This storage facility exceeded all of my expectations. Not only was the property well maintained, but the staff was very polite and approachable. They did a wonderful job of helping me decide which unit was in my best interest within my budget. Everything was explained straight foward n there were no surprises. I would recommend this facility to anyone looking to renting a storage unit of any size. I commend them for their unmatched dedication to customer service.<//Review><userid>106112097937826609253</userid><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

Jessica was very friendly and helpful. The unit was clean but the light was burned out and couldn’t be replaced because she was the only staff person on duty.
The doors from the outside of the storage building and the interior hallway don’t have any way of staying open so it’s awkward to push a cart and open the door at the same time. The entrance from the outside of building has a lip which makes it hard to enter with a full cart.<//text>

As many people know moving into a storage facility involves other challenging life circumstances. One can be in the process of a job transfer, a broken marriage, looking for a place to live, all of these are very stressful to deal with.  I like many others have a very stressful life. And with this stress comes some bad moods and not being real sociable. I must commend Heidi on her caring and professional demeanor. It cannot be easy dealing with all the hard luck stories. She made one facet of my life much easier to deal with. I would highly recommend this facility. It is very clean, it has good lighting and most of all great people.< /text>

<text>This place has many storage unit options, indoor, outdoor & climate controlled. I definitely recommend the climate controlled units... we get hot summer in California not the business... Casey and Setha are wonderful!!! Very professional and fast. They have great work ethic and both are very funny and educated. They absolutely know all the ins and outs of the storage business!! I highly recommend this facility and suggest doing business with Setha & Casey!!
Great job making this a pleasant experience!!!!
You will be seeing more of me and all of my friendly referrals!!!<//text>< name>

Ken Duncan, Sr is the person you need to ask for to get your needs met. He did an excellent job in accomodating us in downsizing our storage place to a smaller unit.  Ken was very helpful in explaining to us the detail, took his time to show us the unit to see if it was worth getting it.  Ken is a very friendly person and easy to talk too...I thought we were going to have difficulty in getting a smaller unit but Ken made it possible for us to switch our unit, the property is clean and well maintained....Thank you Ken you are an awesome person to work with.....Nelson & Luz</review>

Very professional staff, clean, and really nice storage units. They often have 1st month free on selected units. I've taken advantage of that opportunity 2 times already.</Text>

<Review>Wonderful promotional price, we got 2 months free. I was told by 800-number people that it was one 10x20 unit but upon arrival was told it was two 10x10 units, which was fine, but I would have liked to be told beforehand. Units were pretty clean, but the edges had a lot of dirt and spiderwebs, we found a spider or two and some little beetles in our boxes after storage. They definitely need to clean a little better and spray for bugs. Our access code did not work when we came to move it and we could not get in the gate, the office was closed and no one was there to help. Finally another customer let us use their code, and ours didn't get fixed for a few days. The ladies at the counter were nice but didn't seem to know what they were doing and it took them a while to figure out our promotion, reservation, etc. I would recommend but mainly because of the price and location convenience. (note: you do have to buy your own lock).<//Review>< date>

Competitive prices for a superior facility brought me here in the first place. Excellent service kept me here until I moved out of the area. Then, when I returned, I researched and considered other locations but the service was so bad and the prices were not lower, so I came back to Extra Space on Hearn. It's worth a little longer drive. The management and staff are considerate not only of my budget but also safety and convenience. When I needed to move my stuff to a smaller unit they made sure it would be in a nearby spot, easy to move to from my larger unit, because they know I'm disabled. They think of things like that without me having to ask. In a world where real customer service has largely died out, the people here are keeping it alive.< /Review>

<text>This is one of the best storage places I have ever used!!! I was in need of last minute storage, Setha the store manager, went above and beyond, I went to see him to about a specific size space and he helped me measure it to make sure it would fit my needs. He is a awesome guy to deal with and runs a clean, reasonably priced (I even got 1/2 off my first month!). Great job Setha you run an awesome facility!!< /text>< gmap_id>

Setha is the best!! He really makes the place a great and secure place to store my crap. I will only deal with him, since no one is as knowledgeable or nice as Setha is. He's defiantly a keeper. :)
Ooh, almost forgot to mention it is a very clean and nice facility as well.<//text>

Seta and Heidi each went above and beyond for us with our cross-country move.  My mover urged me to get two smaller unit, asserting our 10x30 was not big enough to fit our belongings.  I discovered upon arrival he did not want to walk the small distance to our [large enough] unit, nor did he stack the load anywhere near the height of the unit -- trying to force me into purchasing another unit, which, ?coincidentally? was right smack next to where he parked the truck.   Heidi stepped in, viewed the situation in progress and acted as an advocate for me - asserting all should fit if stacked and loaded correctly.
Further above and beyond, when my teen boy killed my car battery listening to radio, Heidi to the rescue again, drove up with an auto savvy pal and jumped my car. (What a day ugh!)
I am so grateful for the two fantastic employees and for this facility - clean, safe, monitored...I feel completely comfortable knowing our belongings are well looked after!

Walked in and talked to Setha after looking around other storage facilities in the area and I knew I had finally found what I was looking for. The place is big, secure, clean and super friendly. The only thing negative about this place is that the prices can get a bit costly but Setha was very helpful and helped me find something that fit mine and my family's needs.</review>

This place is amazing. Setha a great manager. He answerd all my question and was very polite. I have been renting out a unit here for the last 7 years and have never had an issue with them. I would highly recommend this place to anybody. This place is safe and very clean. They have camera everywhere and I always see Setha walking around with a broom. You can tell he takes great pride in his work. Customer service like no other. Bathrooms were clean and  I really like  the climate control units. Every unit has a roll up door and a modern look. I like it.</text>

The customer service here alone is what made me feel more then comfortable!
I have had another storage off santa rosa Ave and the women there made me cringe every time I went in and paid, or even visited my storage!
I am more then happy with where my belongings are now! Thank you extra space storage!

This is the best storage place ever!!!! I have been to sooooo many storage facilities through the years and this facility and the staff are heads and tails above the rest!!! Setha.... The facility Manager is always so kind and helpful... You rarely see customer service like that anymore he is amazing! I would suggest Extra Space Storage on Hern Ave to anybody. I have been here for 3 years it's been the hardest three years of my life and I am so grateful that Setha and his staff have been there for me always with a smile... always with a kind word... always so helpful I always... providing the best customer service! If you are in the Santa Rosa area there is no where else for your storage needs! Extra Space Storage and their staff.... are amazing!!!.... THE BEST!!!< /review>

Friendly, clean, and organized. Be sure to ask about the referral discount if you know someone else who is already using Extra Space storage for a discount for you and then.<//Text>
