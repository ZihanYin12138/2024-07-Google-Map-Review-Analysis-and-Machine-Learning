Turned out pretty well. Happy with the finished results. Nick who did my hair was very friendly and done a great job on my perm and cut.

Taking off two stars for the pricing being a bit pricy and not upfront.
My total came out to $310. ($209 for perm and $94! For the cut)
I think the perm pricing is fair, but $94 for a few inches off my hair! Definitely over priced imo.  :’(
Wish they would’ve given me an upfront quote instead of waiting till the end.
I will definitely start asking for a firm price from now on 😅

I’d still recommend this salon. It’s very clean and seems filled with friendly people. Just ask for the exact price 😀😀👍< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<username>Katherine Monahan< /username><Date>1615765054102</Date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Mayra has done a wonderful job helping me maintain a professional appearance during Covid and the long months when the salon was closed for services. She asked me a number of thoughtful questions to suggest just the right products to help me take care of my hair when I couldn't get it professionally styled.
I have now been to the salon twice during the pandemic. I am careful about my exposure and felt very safe with the precautions taken by the salon. Mayra listened carefully to what I wanted for my balayage and cut, paid attention to all the details, and did an amazing job. I can't wait to go see her post-pandemic so I can go out afterward with great hair! I have left the salon both times enjoying my time in the chair and feeling fabulous afterward!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Due to the pandemic, I haven't been able to get my hair done since October. I got beautiful low lights and a hair cut done by Mayra and I absolutely love it. I have been going to Mayra for years and she never disappoints. Mayra gave my hair the TLC it needed after my neglect throughout the pandemic. My hair now feels shiny and oh so soft.

Also, Keter has amazing products and recommendations. I cannot get enough of the Kerastase and Shu Uemura products. They smell wonderful and give your hair the life it needs.<//text>< Pics>

<response>None</response><Review>Roxy was on point with coloring my hair to a natural even tone.  I had come in with dark roots over 2 inches long, with light golden blond and copper brown tones hair color through out the rest of my hair.  Not to mention dried out ends and no moisture.    Roxy was able to fix it back to looking beautiful brown color, roots to ends.  With subtle highlights in the sun. The cut was medium length with layers.   I was very happy with returning to my more natural hair tone.< /Review><pics>None</pics><date>1571935952814<//date><gmap_id>0x80857edd4a1b8f3d:0xa90ab19e88018c6c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Talk about a place of so many talented hair stylists! I have two ladies I absolutely love going to and am so happy to have found a local spot that I can trust my hair to be done properly. When I go for color I go to Stephanie and I get my cut from Jess. Honestly they both are just so amazing at hair I would trust either one with cut and color.

Look forward to all my future appointments. I do recommend to plan in advance as sometimes it can be a little bit of a wait (just like anything that is good- it’s in demand).<//text>

I like Nelle.... but I will not be going back. I have been going for the last 8 months, today will be my last time. The salon is more interested in being "dog friendly" versus taking care of the paying human clients. I was 1 of 4 clients there this morning. 2 clients had dogs with them in the chairs, inside the salon... 1 huge and 1 small. No thanks!!!!</review>

<review>Went in for a scheduled consultation to do a purple balayage- waited 30 minutes to see someone but she was very pleasant and we made a plan to lighten my hair then go purple. They scheduled me for a 6PM appointment two weeks later. During my appointment, she decided to not lighten my hair though we had agreed upon doing it in the consultation. Right after, my hair looked really pretty. After a single wash almost all the purple was gone and two weeks later it was completely nonexistent. The cost was 2x what I was quoted. Contacted the salon via email without response then followed up with a phone call. My stylist was supposed to call me back and never did.
I am incredibly disappointed in the $400+ I paid when I could have achieved the exact same results with manic panic from the drugstore.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Roxy is super foxy. Okay, yes, I am a dude and people don't really pay as much attention to my hair or care what it looks like as much as a lady's hair, but I care. And Roxy and all the staff take the time to see to it that I am very well taken care of every time I come in to Keter. They also make it super easy to make and remember appointments by texting me reminders a couple days before, and probably the one of my favorite things about Keter is the free neck trim that I get between cuts, just to make sure I'm looking fly all the time!< /Review>

<text>BEWARE: This salon expects you to give them a 24 hour notice if you want to cancel your appointment, but they will notify you as little as an hour before your appointment if their stylist calls out, and when you ask them what they will do to accommodate you, they'll tell you that they can't help you. My sister was scheduled to get her hair done for a wedding, and these people showed no professionalism to accommodate her for their stylists absence. They did tell here that they could reschedule, but give me a break, what good does that do when the wedding is later in the day and you want to have a good time with your hair looking fresh, and instead you now have to scour the web for another top notch salon that you hope stands true to their rating, and will allow a walk-in; RIDICULOUS. This place has to realize that they are not a Walgreens or a Target, a stylist calling out is not equal to a cashier calling out, you've got to have a plan to satisfy your customer and not lazily leave them hanging because rescheduling does not work for them.
DEAR MANAGEMENT: give your staff a lesson on problem solving, it will do wonders if rescheduling will not suffice to satisfy your client.< /text><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

<text>I was unhappy with my original hair cut/style. Especially because I brought in a picture of what I wanted. My stylist offered to fix it but again I was not happy with the result, and think some damage was done to my hair.

The reason I thought more than one star was appropriate is because even though I am not confident in her abilities, she did schedule two more appointments for me to come in and make changes to my hair. Also the owner contacted me personally to let me know she wanted to do what she could to try to help fix my hair.

I have been going to Keter since 2002, and always found past stylists very capable and was very happy with my results.  I will not be returning after this visit.</text>< name>

<review>Awesome place with amazing customer service. The guys at the register are always polite and welcome people when they come in and out. The fish there are very well taken care of and their corals are very healthy. Prices aren't so bad and everything is very healthy. They are mostly a place that sells saltwater fish and corals but they do have about 4 tanks with freshwater fish beautiful place with friendly staff.</review>< Pictures>

This store is more than a fish store its a salt water tank training school .if you have ever been afraid of having a saltwater tank mark and his staff will happily  guide you through the steps. and in no time you will have your own piece of the ocean .< /review>

Small store but the gentleman running the shop was very knowledgeable and helpful. His prices are by far the best, I have shopped at many stores for salt water fish and coral and he has the best quality and prices hands down. I have only been once since I do not live in this area but I for sure will go again when I am looking to add to my 125g aquarium.</Text>

I've been coming to Ultimate Aquarium for years.  Nobody in the Valley does it better.  Mark, and all the staff, are super knowledgeable.  He'll you the truth - he's not just trying to sell you something. He stocks the best fish from the big suppliers in LA.  He knows his stuff and stocks the best fish and corals you could ask for!<//review>

<text>Walked into the store today wanting to purchase my first saltwater tank.  . . Not good experience,  nobody even acknowledged I was in the store I stood right in front of one guy on the phone and the other rambling on about sand to another guest. I walked in with $1000 wanting to give them and walked out with the same amount in my pocket. I will no longer try to go to this establishment . all other reviews seem good ,maybe these guys where having a bad day? Ehhh.<//text></record>

Small LFS. More tanks with salt water fish than fresh water. Nice selection of live rock and I got freeze dried blood worms at a really good price. They have some stocking up to do with decor, filter media, and such, but this little store has some potential.<//review>

Very helpful and knowledgeable place and will even test your water for free. We would not have the beautiful aquarium we have without their help.<//Text>

Mark is a very friendly and knowledgeable business owner.  He knows all there is about fresh and saltwater fish, and shares his knowledge with all his customers.

Mark's prices are fare, and you know if there is a problem with any fish or aquarium product that he sells you that he will back it up 100% and do what needs to be done to make it right.

Go here before you go to any of the big chain stores, you won't be sorry!</Review>

<review>For there rating online i was not very impressed with the shop. Very small. Not many choices for freshwater fish. A buddy of mine called them to see if they had any 8" koi and they said yes and that it was beautiful. I have an 8" koi so know the size. We drove all the way there to find out it was only half that size and way over priced. Probably won't go back.</review>< Rate>

I whanted to take the time and write a review about Ultimate Aquarium! I have bought several cichlids from Mark and I have not lost one cichlid? They are now having babies and doing great. Every time I have gone into the shop some one was there or Mark waited on me from the time I walked in? Great aquarium store! Shop with confidence! Thanks Mike!🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟< /text>

<user_name>Stewart Clan< /user_name><date>1529396658528< /date><Rating>2</Rating><text>Edit 5/12/2017: I wanted to like this place but the person who worked there killed our order. He didn't mean it, it was just from not being knowledgable. We ordered shrimp and unfortunately they got put directly in the store's tanks with large agressive cichlids, which promptly ate them before I could pick them up. Would have liked if they called us when our order came in but they mention they want us to wait a day to pick it up so they can make sure that the items don't have issues. To add to it every fish we ordered from them have been sick. Tip, if you get anything from this place put your fish in a quarantine and observe it for 2 weeks minimum or you'll be out money and time. There intentions are good but there lack of knowledge makes it hard to buy from them with confidence. So far fish from petco and petsmart were in better health than this place, which is sad. I expected a lot more from a store run by a "marine biologist." I now order online or drive to Seven Seas pet store in Clovis which I had better luck. Prefer working with the owner there.

I hope they can get a little bit more knowledge under there belt and take in there orders properly in the future to avoid such experiences.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I spent a lot of time (and money) looking for the right music room for my son who was crawling at 6m and really needed more stimulation. This place is hands down the best I have found. The thought and care that goes into the structure of this place are superior. The movement, musical instrument education, and energy are just what my son needs to keep him engaged. An ideal place for kids to enjoy and learn!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Fun place to have a birthday party. It's very expensive and you only get 2 hours. You get charged to bring in your own food. And everything else is extra like balloons. I like this place for open Play better.<//Text>< Pictures>

This playroom was the best play spot I have taken my little children. It was so bright and clean. They have awesome coffee and food options. My other mom friends and I enjoy coming here and catching up over coffee while the little ones play. I have been to a couple of their private events, and they are so well done!<//text>

We celebrated our daughter's 6th birthday at this location on Easter Sunday and we got a killer deal! The experience is worth revisiting. She and her friends had a great time and we enjoyed a stress free children's party! I only wish that they offered more than two hours per event. Don't forget to check out their website for specials!</Review>

Had fun at a birthday party. The staff is really good, interactive with kids and helpful too. We went to two play rooms which were huge and the employees were guiding kids all the time, which is good. The birthday room was nicely decorated and one employee was always there to lead through, guide the kids, make it more organized and also serve food and cake to everyone. I liked the way everything was wrapped up in 2 hours.<//Review>

I loved this location, ever since they changed the set up in this location I don’t like coming here anymore. My smaller kids have a hard time with this new set up. I recommend for kids 6+ NOT smaller than that or else it will be challenging for them.< /Text>

They make the party planning and the day of stress free. Their are 2 bounce rooms and a party room that you rotate through. They set up the party room. You can bring your own party goods if you have a theme or use theirs. They gave my daughter a birthday crown( that she got to keep) and had a big inflatable royalty chair to sit in. My daughter loved this!
They even took pictures for us!

i love this place! there are different rooms for the kids to play in. i was there for a birthday party and we started off in one room then they moved us to another that had different inflatables and games than the first one. the third room is for food and birthday song. my daughter had so much fun. I had fun! the adults can play games in the rooms too. i recommend this place for parties. the staff is awesome. there was a party host with us the whole time. he was interactive with the kids as he guided us to each room. the only downside was everything seemed SO fast. it was something like 2 hours altogether, but with all the playing the time spent in each room just seemed so quick.<//text>

Also, it felt as if the second room they herded us all into felt rushed like "get the eff out! It's late!". (maybe not) but it did feel like we were being shuttled quickly into the next part of the schd< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I will probably never bring my little one to this place.  The floor is hard concrete with very thin carpet. Lack of protection. They also use teenager staff who probably didn’t get any straining. During my daughter’s classmate party, a young staff stood on a tube shape block to entertain the kids then encouraged them to do so. (Definitely inappropriate for that age.) A girl fell with face touched ground first. She lost a whole lot of blood. The staff stood there without knowing what to do. The little girl’s parents took her to restroom to clean up and complained PumpUp just provided an ice pad and didn’t check with them afterwards and pretended nothing happened when they left. Definitely a cheap place without sufficient protection.< /review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>This is the 2nd year in a row that my son opted to have his birthday party at Pump it Up, Irvine (he turned 7 this year.) The staff is excellent, the facility is clean and welcoming.  The pizza that comes with the party packages is actually pretty decent.  Again, the staff is EXCELLENT.

Having said that, for the amount of money that one puts out for a private party (in excess of $400), it's insane that we had to pay for the air hockey table on top of it. I was so embarrassed when parents started digging for change and someone told me what was going on.  Of course my husband and I then went and got a few dollars worth of quarters.  Why on earth is the air hockey table not included?  Either include it or remove it from the room.

Please note: YOU WILL NEED TO BRING YOUR OWN WATER IF YOU WANT THE KIDS TO  HAVE WATER.  IT IS NOT PROVIDED.  They provide 1 juice box per child at the very end with the pizza.  We brought water and they put it out on the cart for the kids.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>Pump it up was a very fun place and I would love to go again. My younger sister had a blast, with two rooms of enjoyment. The staff were very welcoming and made sure everyone was enjoying themselves, especially with the inflatable party chair. My younger sister felt very welcome and so did I, she wants all her birthday parties there now. Overall pump it up is a great place for kids to go wild, jump, and enjoy in the party room with a bunch of friends.< /Text><Date>1514856176914< /Date>< userid>

Over the past 5 or so years, we've attended several Pump-it-Up parties at the Irvine location for our kids.  We also hosted a party for our daughter several years, and then yesterday had the opportunity to host a party for our son.

As a guest or coming to Pump-it-Up for open jump sessions, I would give this location a 4 star review.  Kids always have a great time, which is the main goal here, right?

My 2 star rating is based on our experience in hosting our son's birthday party yesterday.

For a weekend party with up to 25 kids, it costs $390, and this does not include the mandatory charges for pizza, drinks etc.  So, for a party to include your family, and kids from school, etc. we paid around $525.  (This doesn't include decorations, goodies bags, balloons, cake, etc.)  For our family, this is a large amount for a birthday party, therefore, I have high expectations.

Bottom line, I was disappointed with the staff that was assigned to our group yesterday.  They kept miscounting the number of children that were attending our party, they tangled up our birthday balloons, they did not follow-through with specific requests (but very simple requests) for the party set-up and how we wanted my son's birthday wish & cupcake-candle blow-out to go down.  They also forgot to turn-on the special light show and didn't follow-through with playing a game with the kids after pizza time.  Although our coordinator was sweet, I did give her specific directions that simply weren't followed.  I also felt like every time I tried to find her, I simply couldn't.

I was also expecting more help from Pump-It-Up staff for serving pizza, fruit and cupcakes.  Instead, we were just assigned 1 coordinator for our party.  It created stress for myself and my family having to handle so much in the party room, instead of being able to sit back and enjoy our friends and family that traveled to celebrate and enjoy our children.

Isn't that what we were paying for with having our party hosted there?

4 years ago, this was not the case when we hosted our daughter's birthday party here.

I'm disappointed and feel that I completely overpaid due to the lack of service support.  I really would recommend finding another venue to host your child's next birthday!< /review>

The kids have lots of fun but the place hasn't changed in all the years.
The carpet is dark and appeares to never have been washed. There is a strong odor which is being masked with air fresheners. The staff is friendly and helpful. All in all, this isn't my first choice to take kids to have fun.< /text>

We recently hosted our son's 7th birthday party here and he absolutely loved it. The staff is super friendly. A special mention to Brittany who hosted our party. She was absolutely meticulous in arranging every thing, organizing kids  and distributing food. There was a little mistake in the bill which I realized later. They corrected it and refunded the money. Deducting one star for the confusion in billing. Also if they can use a better camera for pics. A bit on the pricey side but well worth as all the kids enjoyed a lot. I would love to host my future parties there.<//Review>

<text>Booked a party for 25 kids celebrating my daughter's birthday and it went seamlessly.  Very prepared and went like clockwork.  They've got it down to a science (40 minutes in one room, 40 in another, and the last 40 in the party room for pizza and cake).  2 hours and you're done!  The staff even does all the clean-up!  It's a controlled environment, so I like that you don't have to worry about kids wandering off or inclement weather.  Employees were very friendly and accommodating.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is a wonderful location for having a bday party with minimal work. They have many nice and exciting toys and equipments and they move the kids from their first room to the second one in the middle of the party, so the kids stay excited all the time. My only complain is that they didn't include the air hockey in the package and we had to pay for that by quarters. Seems pretty cheap to me to try to make a few dollars extra from that when the host has already paid hundreds of dollars... Otherwise a great place!< /Review><user_name>Nina Dean</user_name></record>

Very attentive, we didn't have to do anything but enjoy the day celebrating.  I really appreciated that the staff worked well with the kids, gave clear directions, and kept the party going.  It was a really great experience and I would highly recommend having your child's bday here.</Review>< Pictures>

I had a birthday party for both of my kids at this place. It was so much fun. all the invited kids (ages 2-7) and their parents (include me) had a blast. One of their parents thanked me afterwards for how well her son napped that afternoon after the 10-12 party exhausted him pretty well. lol.
The best thing is that I don't have to spend time planning the party. All the little details are taken care of. The most time I spent on was deciding how many pizzas to get and what kind. BTW, the pizzas are actually pretty good. I wouldn't have been able to throw a party without Pump it up making it so easy for me. I was able to enjoy the party, have fun with the kids, instead of worrying about the logistics. The staff were all very friendly and professional. They did make a couple minor mistakes which didn't bother me personally, 1) they forgot to turn on the bubbles feature which I requested for one of the jump rooms; 2) they forgot to hang one of the banners I brought. But the rest of the party was perfect and without any hiccups.
In my opinion, the party price is very reasonable, but the food cost adds up, so bring as much as you are allowed to on your own.< /text>

We have been there for birthday parties and I can't say Im too impressed with their cleanliness.  Additionally, their cancellation policy for reservations is unreasonable and lacks customer consideration.  I booked a party 9 days ago for a mid August party. I just learned that kindergarten starts that Tuesday which made the party challenging.  Other dates were prohibitive due to my work schedule and I didn't want a low turn out due to school start date.  I felt that perhaps they would consider giving me at least half my deposit, provided the ample amount of time they have to re-book. However, that was not the case.  I will not consider this location or franchise for any parties.< /review>

< Review>
First of all, the place smells like dirty socks.  Secondly, if you go to these types of places, PLEASE SUPERVISE YOUR CHILDREN.  Get off your phones, stop texting and chatting with the other Moms about some great nail salon that just opened up.  You MUST pay attention to your children AT ALL TIMES as there are several things your children can hurt themselves on.  Also, supervision is minimal as they only have teenagers walking around pretending like they care about the safety of your children.  I have attended a handful of parties at this place and I've seen cuts, bad collisions, stitches and separated shoulders.  I get it, you don't want to put the work into hosting a REAL party, so please watch your children.  Especially the ones who are out of control and behave like knuckleheads.< /Review>

Paul is a great mechanic, he is kind professional and always comes through when you need him. I use my car for business so I need my repairs done fast. Paul has always been such a help when my car breaks down. Paul tells you how it is, charges a fair price and is fast!<//review>

I love this place!! I only trust Paul with my car! I literally travel 23 miles just to go and have my car repaired here.
They are honest and they never are out to make a buck! their only goal is to make their customers happy and I am! It is almost impossible to find a mechanic that you trust and I trust them!!!</review>

One of the last few honest mechanic shops out there. I live in Fontana but I still come out to get my oil change and other car issues addressed. They get you in and out rather quickly.
Paul is very knowledgeable and honest, I recommend him to all my friends and family as well as to you my google family.<//Review>

<Review>My car suddenly started making loud noises, and then my check engine light came on, so I was concerned that it was something serious. Since it was right after Christmas I was also concerned about how much it would cost. I looked around online for someone locally and started reading the different reviews. They mentioned that this place was honest and did great work. When I got there, there were a few people ahead of me, and more kept showing up, it was also close to lunch time, so I was concerned that it would take long for my car to get checked and worked on. A few minutes later my car was lifted and looked at, and the manager Paul told me, that my issue was not serious, it was only the oxygen sensor that had come loose, and it would only cost $30 for them to have it fixed. It's true, the manager Paul is very honest! They could have made up a story and told me it was something more serious to charge me more, but he didn't. My car was quickly fixed, and sounds normal now. I can see why people take the time to write good reviews about this place. I'd highly recommend them!<//Review>< pictures>

Took my car in after I heard some weird metal scraping noise in my engine and saw my engine light go on. I was honestly expecting to pay up a couple hundred for some big replacement job. Paul (owner) asked some questions, said he'll look into it and ten minutes later called me to tell me he found a stick under my car by my axle and that the light was on just for an oil change. One of the few places where they won't upsell or say some BS. He was honest, straight to the point and did the work quickly.< /review>

Most times, low prices. Paul (Owner) is friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.  He gives us options for the work being done, and that really helps ease the stress of even having to deal with maintenance and repairs.  Express General Auto Repair will continue to be our stop for our vehicle care and repair.<//Text>< pictures>

Paul is the best.. He and the boys do a good job. He's super cool dude straight to the point and honest. He let's you know what you'll need soon and doesn't pressure you to get it done with him. Place is always busy so come with enough time to spare don't expect to show up and get treated right away. Hell ask what you need but then usually they're working on cars already. The boys do move fast tho and I sense no laziness at all good shop have been going here for years. Burger spot right next door too if you're hungry haha.</review>

I don’t think they know what they are doing. I’ve done oil change and a bit of coolant. My coolant color changed. So now I have to go to dealership and completely replace the coolant which cost 180 bucks. And I don’t know what oil do they use. It’s kinda annoying.< /text>

His recommendations are fair and I appreciate his reliability.  It helps that your car is always ready when they say it's going to be ready.  My husband and I trust him tremendously.< /Text>< Pics>

This spot is my favored. I visit a lot of restaurants but to this one I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very cordial and the food they offer is so fresh and tasty. I never miss an opportunity to have a decent dinner in this place. Highly recommended.< /review>

< review>
The people here are really nice and detail oriented.
The food was also good.
To use the restroom you need a passcode which they will provide to you.
Plenty of parking as well and other stores around it.
I would totally come back again<//review>

Holy cow, embarrassingly bad experience. Old rice and old orange chicken. Steak and shrimp bowl had two shrimp (I counted) and one shriveled piece of steak. Watched the girl behind the counter DUMP AN OLD ORDER BACK INTO THE FOOD BEING SERVED. Avoid!<//Review>

Very elegant and welcoming restaurant. They provide big portions and for inexpensive prices. I loved the food a lot and the staff members were very personal and chatty. I recommend this place.<//review>

I really like this panda express. Friendly staff, food cooked right (not overdone like the one by the airport) and it's near my home. It is smaller than most making it ideal for take-out.</Text>

I called store upset ! I don't know how the manager ( I wish I knew his name ) some how and almost instantly solved the problem.. 3 minutes later I was enjoying my lunch, honestly it was one of the few lunchs I really enjoyed, not only because of the food, but because the attention !

The food was decent, but the cashiers and servers don't speak English. It was very hard to communicate. I asked if I could order a soup and it took them a couple minutes to realize what I wanted. The young man rolled his eyes at me for no reason? The experience was enough for me to not come back.</text>

The rules simply don't apply here, the staff is never behind the counter... Last time he was on the field playing and the refs are obviously rejects from other leagues.  The nets are falling down and field needs maintenance (the rubber base is pushed into mounds around the edge of the field)</text>

This is our first season at this place with boys under 14. Very unfair referees, but the main thing we're upset about is that they don't check the ages of the players. Our 12-13 year old boys had to play with the guys who are taller than their coach. When we asked administration to prove one of the player's age, they just showed us a copy of his birth certificate which stated that he is 13. How can they prove that this is his certificate and  not his brother's for example? I mean, they should require a school picture ID or some other proof of age. This boy wasn't even in the team when we played with them a couple weeks ago. We won last time, so they added one more older players to their team... We will complete this season, but are never coming back here again.< /text>

My first month was not free as advertised.  I declined to sign the last portion of the agreement when it stated that they were amending and nullifying two of the stipulations or articles in the sticking process. Yet they took money out of my account  anyway . I was a lousy 20 min late leaving property one night , they called me the next morning  threatening me . Horrible way to do business. Not at all happy with this place . The location sucks
also. I really think this place is has a poor
way of doing business< /Text>< Resp>

<text>Monique was super helpful. The customer service she had was great. She took us to the unit that she showed us and explained how to organize the unit to make it fit when we moved in. The facility is really clean and I would recommend renting here as the employees are helpful.

Monnique is the nice gal in the office, she showed me more than one storage and did it patiently. My husband and i were impressed that the young lady took the time to show us storages without rushing like most people do. Even though we did not get the unit that day, because our escrow fell through last minute, she still was kind and thanked me for coming in. When we need storage again, and we will, we will most certainly use smart stop!</Text>

My unit and at least 4 more were broken into over the weekend at night. We have been renting the unit for a year. The theives trashed it!! There was suppose to be 24 hour surveillance but nothing was filmed, no security was there and the $2000 insurance policy that we bought from them didn't cover hardly anything.  Beware!!<//text>

Great, safe place to leave your valuables! I had to move into a smaller home for awhile and couldn't take most of my stuff so I had to rent out a storage unit! Got a great deal and a good sized unit! They gave me a run down of the rules for the property and a view of the unit! Every time I stop by the employees are extremely friendly, especially Monique! She takes care of the grounds very well. As I was moving my stuff I saw her cleaning the property and she was very welcoming. All in all, safe storage and great customer service!<//Text>

Great prices and superior customer service from Monique. She was friendly, professional and informative. We rented from this company a few years ago, with a male manager. When we came back to SmartStop, we were pleasantly surprised that there was a new manager who knew so much. So different from out last experience. Thank you SmartStop. We highly recommend to anyone looking to store locally!!</Text>

So far move in experience was a breeze. It were simple to check sizes available and price options. It was easy to reserve a unit ahead of time.
I found an online coupon offer that gave me my first month free on a month to month contract,so no long term commitment . At this particular location the office was open until 6pm . ( Many self storage companies close their office at 5pm )
Office staff is very pleasant , prompt, communicative, and easy going.
The gate access hours to all unit renters is awesome, 6am - 10pm which is exactly what I was in desperate need of ( later gate access ). I’ve only had my unit a week or two but I think I made a great choice by renting from SmartStop Self Storage.</review>

I'm looking into  buying a storage units because i'm running out of space to hold my belongings at my home. i went to this location because it's the nearest one to my home. I had a pleasant time checking out their units. Their employee Dave showed us hospitality, answered all our questions, and made the process easy. I highly recommend if you live in the area and need a storage unit  go check this place out.</text>

<text>My first storage rental experience was excellent. Jill is the bomb! First of all..she waited for us a couple minutes after they closed and continued to show me the spaces available. We found one and she helped me through the process. She didn't make me feel like I was keeping her from going home. She provided EXCELLENT customer service and had a smile on the whole time. I will most definitely use SmartStop as my storage place from now on and recommend them to anyone. Much respect< /text>< user_name>

Edited review:
I took away 2 stars because I was told I was covered until the last 6 days of June and that I had a grace period of 5 days from the first to pay the pro rated amount.

I went in on June 6th to get my stuff out and was charged the pro-rated amount. I asked about this and was given an entirely different story about why I was being charged that. My things were only there for 2 weeks. I will say that they're super friendly about everything, it's not like they give you attitude, just be cautious about when you get your stuff out.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1559105122956, 'text': 'Amber Wycuff, your wonderful feedback and rating mean a lot to us.'}< /response>< GmapID>

This place has been great so far. Reasonable prices, high ceilings, clean facilities, and all drive-up units makes this place an excellent choice. The site also has a bathroom, cool water, and air conditioning in the office, which were all necessary when moving in this summer heat. The manager, Jon, was incredibly helpful and kind, making the whole stressful process of moving slightly more pleasant.</text>

As a business owner and homeowner, we store our precious belongings. The staff here is goes above and beyond the call of duty. I have stored and many other facilities and what keeps me here is the staff. Also no one in the city of Riverside can even come close to their prices.<//text>

Went online and reserved a unit first.  Was immediately called and helped out by On-site manager Jon who was extremely helpful and friendly. He had a unit ready when I  pulled up. Very reasonable rates!  Paperwork was a breeze.  In and out by 15 mins. Thanks Jon!< /text>

<Review>Jon was very helpful and made the rental process quick and simple.
He explained everything to me about the facility, billing and even showed me my storage unit.
The facility is well taken care of and very clean.
I would definitely recommend Extra Space Storge.< /Review><user_id>111190527304071520040</user_id>< Resp>

Was COMPLETELY taken care of by Jill! I was so indecisive on what i wanted to the point of cancelling out the original unit i had selected the day after i had selected it.

She was really patient with me during my trial of indecisiveness and it is fully appreciated. The other lady there was extremely helpful as well i just didnt get to interact with her as much.

I ended up selecting the 9X8 unit as i was trying to figure out which size would hold all the stuff i had in my 1br apt. All of my stuff fit (beds. Tables, included) and i appreciate the kindness received in that stressful, moving period. Jill you're awesome!<//review>

Do not depend on this place to secure your belongings.
We were ripped off of all of our belongings, although they do have alot of homeless living in storage units, in my opinion it was an inside job.
Our lock was cut off unit, all belongings were stolen, they had time to remove all belongings from their individual boxes, leaving only empty boxes in storage unit, then someone put on a new lock only sold at extra space.
There are no security cameras & with people having unauthorized access 24/7 I have to say this is a theft waiting to happen.
When we reported theft to office, they were not surprised saying they had 6 thefts in the last month & also admitting they had 5 homeless living in units.
Do yourself a favor & look elsewhere or you will encounter the same fate as I did.< /review>

<Review>Good prices. Cheaper than most for the amount of space. Safe with very strick rules pertaining to gate entry security purposes. Very clean and well maintained. The manager/front desk was very helpfull, nice, and gave me helpful information about what and how to store things.  As well as polices pertaining to the paper work, cancelations and billing. I'm usually a cautious of ppl and he seemed to put mind at ease for storing my belongings.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

At first, we stop at the store off Florida and Sanderson,  crazy rude, not helpful. We wanted to open a new account.  They can't give us any information.  We left and came here, omg Vanessa is super helpful and great. We left with a new phone new plan and satisfied customer. BEST VERIZON STORE EVER!!!<//review>

Your better off going to the Corp. Store on Sanderson and Florida ave! They have more authorization to help with any problems you have.
For instance,  if there is a problem with your Sim card the Corp. Store will set you up with a free sim card where as the other store will charge you for it<//text>

<time>1592422535455</time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I called to ensure they had the Go Advantage cover for my iPhone 8 in stock, and that I could bring in my three children under 5, before driving the 15 minutes to the store. I was assured all would be fine and easy. Then I arrived. They told me I couldn’t go in without all my children in masks. My youngest just turned 1. It is illegal to require an infant to wear a mask and unsafe due to suffocation risk. He finally let us in and told me the cover I needed was not actually in stock so I wasted a trip with three small kids. Typically I understand that things are out of stock sometimes. But I called and was assured it was there and I could just come by anytime for a quick replacement. I’m extremely disappointed in the customer service given just now at the Hemet location.< /Text>< pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>This place was absolutely a scam. They seem as if they are with Verizon, however they are just a third party seller. Verizon will not rectify any issue that arises though dealing with GoWireless. I spoke to an associate in regards to an upgrade I had on my phones. We paid for our phones and discussed everything in the paperwork that we would be signing with the representative. We were under the impression that the paperwork we signed was for a flat rate payment for the phones after the upgrade. Instead we paid money and we were still signed up for a device payment plan. I exhausted myself going back and forth with the manager who basically told us his employee said it didn’t happen that way and it was their word against ours. I called Verizon because I’ve been a loyal customer for 20 years and unfortunately they said they couldn’t do anything because it was done through GoWireless. Worst experience ever. I do recommend going to an actual Verizon store. I’ve never had any problems with purchasing new phone or device from Verizon stores and the employees are honest.< /text>< pictures>

<review>This Hemet store location is amazing!  Great customer service! I’m far from knowledgeable coming to iPhones and this Verizon store is so patient with me. They explain things so I can understand. Today I came in because my phone was not working properly. Wayne did a 1 min. fix and explained how to fix it if it happens again. Earlier I went to the Menifee store which is 3 min. from my home and they wouldn’t even give me the time. I know I was supposed to make an appointment but, I couldn’t because my phone wouldn’t work. Instead I had to drive 20 min. to Hemet. It took Wayne 1 minute to fix it. Glad I took the drive. Now, I can get back to work.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Although it has been several years since I dealt with this store, they are not Verizon.  GoWireless sells Verizon products & services, but will not help you with problems like billing etc.  I would never go to this store again.  They sold me Frontier TV service, and I had problems from the start.  Many hours spent on the phone because once they get your signature & walk out the door, that's the end of what they will do for you!!!< /review>

With that being said, he helped us walk out with two new phones and a tablet for a great price.

<Text>I had several questions regarding my new LG G5 and Corey answered them all.  I also brought in the LG 360 degree camera and asked for assistance on set-up and a "mini" tutorial on how to use it.  Corey was fantastic!  He took the time to explain what he was doing and then showed me step by step how to use it.  By the way, the 360 is fantastic.  But I believe Corey went above and beyond expectations I had regarding his skill, knowledge, attitude, and customer service.  Kudos to Verizon for having him on your staff.  And would do recommend him to others?  Oh yeah!!#</Text>< gmap_id>

I'm not that fluent with electronics but they make me confident that they have my best Intrest at hand. So much better than any other phone store I've ever dealt with. Please let them know, that they are doing a great job and this kind of service along with Verizon's performance keeps me as a happy and loyal customer. I will always recommend Verizon to others due largely to the employees of this particular Verizon store.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I came into the store a days ago and I'm very happy with the service I was given. I came in and had a question about my iPhone 6 and Victoria really helped. She answered all of my questions and explained very well and always had a smile. I'm thankful that she was patient with me.  She was very nice and seemed happy to be helping me. And from what I could see all other employees also seemed happy and very professional.

I went in for an upgrade, I could have done this online. But I prefer a little better service for what I pay, and a real person that will give you a few hints on your device, and make sure you are up and running before blowing you off. I can say I will continue to go to Go because I received far better customer service than I have been able to even beg for and get in a corporate Verizon.  Thanks!< /review>< Pictures>

Wonderful customer service! Ronnie went above and beyond to get me the exact product I was wanting. Even to the point of driving to an out of town location to pick up the phone I wanted. He was so attentive and took the time to explain and show us what we needed to know in order to understand the products we purchased. Such a great atmosphere in this store. Ronnie and Cheriece  were both so helpful and pleasant to work with! Thank you<//text>

My spouse and I walked into this store last Friday night, just to ask a couple questions. We had tried to ask the questions at the Verizon store,on Florida Ave and were brushed off and given an 800 number to call.  Because Cory took the time to actually talk with us and explain our questions, we ended up upgrading our phones and doing some changes.  What a great experience.  I highly recommend this store.< /Review>

They had the phone on the floor but didn't have one to sell me, had a more expensive phone that if 5G was available in my area I woyld have got but its like two years before that service is available. But if your an I-phone of Samsung person they can help you.< /Review>

Best customer service ever !!!! Thank you Ronnie for making my purchase so pleasant. After what happened to me at Verizon corporate I needed a rep that actually knows how to do his job and can explain any question I ask. I would recommend coming to the store people. If you go to the corporate store they'll screw you over. They don't care about the customer and are only in it to make you a sale. Emerick thank you for dealing with me the night before. Verizon is lucky to have you two representing their company< /text>

Just left Verizon store off of stetson and Sanderson, as always I'm very pleased with the customer service of all Verizon associates at this location. Had a broken screen and staff was happy to help with the issue through guidance and proper channels needed to fix my phone...I enjoy the positive energy and very respectful employee Conduct. Thank you Verizon.<//Text>

The most beautiful woman I ever met assisted me with the perfect phone a Samsung Galaxy 6 edge plus. Everything was explained thoroughly and simple to understand. She only offered what was necessary and was throughly able to answer all my questions . I recommend anyone looking for a Verizon phone and service too see Karen she was a great example of how people should be treated. I am recommending her to all my family and friends.</Review>

<text>It was a nightmare and I was charged for things I didn't need I had a trade in phone that I never got credit for. I went back 3 times and got nowhere now I'm locked into a contract and paying 50 more than before I ended up with the same phone paid 260. Now I'm paying 27 for 24 months I also paid for an upgrade and stocking fee 35 my first bill was 180 for what I don't know. I never got upgrade I walked out with same phone no upgrade yet I paid for upgrade.my bill is now 150 when it was only 79. Does not make sense I walked out with the same phone I should be back on my original plan but I'm not cause this Brian guy locked me into an other phones plan. The phone I had for 3 days that I hated so I took back to go back to what I had when I first walked in. I will never go to this store again.<//text></record>

PS
Don't go to the other VERIZON Store in Hemet at Florida Ave. It's the opposite !!!  Very rude and not competent customer service. The "Manager" Diana called me an idiot. Unbelievable !
This Store has 3.1 stars in the Google rating...... no comment !< /Review>

<user_name>Douglas Jenks</user_name><review>Brought a client here to get him a new phone.  The service was a hustle and the truly terrible employee "erik" was one of the least qualified individuals to ever achieve gainful employment.  He clearly wanted the sale and did not want to help out my client.  17 days later the phone dies, and he pretends not to remember us and tells us we have nothing we can do.  I mentioned to my client that Verizon's phone return policy was a scam and received a belligerent response from "erik",  Do NOT go to this store, and consider whether you want to go to any Verizon store.< /review>< userid>

I took my Dad in there today to see what's wrong with his phone, waited and waited while the black guy and white girl helped other customers but where acting like they where at a party, laughing and talking about other things, not phones. Very unprofessional employees.<//text>

< review>
Walked in, no "Hi!" no , "Welcome!" Two girls working...1 helping a customer the other fidgeting on her phone. 10min later the 1 fidgeting on her phone walks up and tells me she's off to lunch and will help me if I'm still here when she returns and or the other girl working will when shes done helping the customer shes with. Wow.< /review>

A great local Italian restaurant that serves fresh, delicious and authentic Italian food. They also bake all their bead in house! My favorites are the Fried Mozzarella and the Deluca's Special Pizza. Rafael and his staff are so kind and truly care about the quality of their food and their customers dining experience. Highly recommend!< /text>

I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Pasta and sauce were "meh" not flavorful, but my goodness were the meatballs terrible. Now, I'm not sure what they were made out of but the taste was repulsive. As well, I took one bite of the canoli and did not like it.
However, my parents' entrees were "satisfactory." Portions are generous and the bread is nice and fluffy. Side salads are generic but were delightfully fresh. To me, no difference between De Luca's and Lascari's down the street.<//text>

<Review>We visited here this past fathers day 6/18/2017 It was the best decision we made. The place was amazing, very quiet, romantic, the service was outstanding. ask for Marco he was our waiter. The best part was the food!  We ordered the specials The colossal shrimp and the lobster scampi style. The picture does not do it justice for $24 we received a very large lobster looked like 9-10oz very filling. The shrimp was very colossal for $22 both served with linguine. This place is a hidden treasure in east Whittier. We highly suggest visiting this gem. We will return soon. Thank you De Luca's for a special night and thank you Marco for your kindness you made us feel at home.</Review><user_id>104820590242366906286<//user_id>< Date>

Love this place, food is A+±+++ and service is also always great!! But the owner makes this place more like a family, he always greets everyone, takes the time to talk to his patrons and get to know them that shows he cares about his patrons and business. So far everything we have tried here has been super delicious!!!<//Text>

Wow, talk about a hidden gem in plain site.
This was my first visit here after growing up in this area for over 20 years!
But back to the food, which is great!
I always test an Italian restaurant with how they make Angel hair pasta, (Easy to over cook)
And they made it SPOT ON! With a lobster tail to boot!
My next test is... LASAGNA!< /review>

Long time customers since I was a kid.  First time back after the fire... we ordered to go.

It was horrific.

Mac and cheese and gnocchi with alfredo.  I think they ran out of salt.  It was nasty. So disappointing. I used to really enjoy the ma  and cheese, and it was just not good at all.

Very sad.<//Review>

Valentines Day, made reservations and got seated in the back room. No atmosphere, nothing  to look at. Very slow service, no wine list. Food was average, not worth the price charged. Place needs some serious decoration, skilled wait staff, and better food.</Text>

Been coming here for a few years, but now, I will think twice about going back.  For some reason, raphael has decided to charge an additional fee of $3.99 for splitting entrees. That I understand, since it's extra work for the kitchen and he does add a soup or salad. However, sharing an entrée is not the same as splitting. It doesn't involve any extra work for the kitchen and the soup it comes with is disgusting. Pasta fagioli is not made that way. I got bean soup with some macaroni. No carrots, no celery, and especially, no tomatoes. I didn't want the soup, because I wasn't that hungry.</Review>

<resp>None</resp><text>For me, the portions give me a 2 day treat. The stuffed eggplant has been my favorite for years. The fact that you have your choice of pasta and the tomato basil sauce is wonderful.
The bread is still like the days when you looked into the kitchen and Mama was making the bread.
I'm so glad to see them open again, we missed you while you were closed.
The staff from the desk, to our young server to the boss, thank you for your attention and politeness.

< Review>
Since we live in Connecticut, every year I give my daughter (who lives in Hacienda Heights) a Christmas gift card for what I think looks to be an interesting restaurant.  Well I have never had a problem with charging it to my credit card (not a debit card), until today.  After much research I thought De Luca's would be a very nice place for my daughter and husband to have a wonderful Italian meal and the ambience looked quite lovely.  And, I thought that when we would visit we might go there for dinner sometime.

When a gentleman got on the phone he said that they didn't accept credit cards. Because he was sort of evasive in his explanation, I was made to think that this was because I was calling from out of state.  What that would have to do with anything when all I wanted to do was buy a $60 dollar Christmas gift card for their restaurant.  I have an excellent credit rating and have never had my credit card turned down even in Europe.  I was insulted.  He seemed to be hemming and hawing around the discussion.

As I have stated, I have done this with other restaurants in his vicinity and never had a problem.  In fact, they were very happy to accommodate my request and accepted my credit card with absolutely no hassle.   Sorry to say, when we visit we will not be stopping by this restaurant.<//Review>

A friend took me for my birthday last night. I rate them a Michelin two star for sure. The food is Master or Iron Chef quality and The Tuesday night entertainment is fantastico.

Looked forward to eating here after it was closed due to a fire. However, the first day of business was not the day to go. Granted, we had a large group but food was served cold, only one server for our party of eighteen and requests for salad, bread, cheese, drinks had to be made several times. Food was okay but not served hot.

We'll wait a while before going back.<//Text>

The customer service was great, really nice people, the hostess was a young girl and very polite and respectful. The food on the other hand i didn't enjoy as much. I think my wife and i over paid a little too much for the portion of our meal and it wasn't cooked as good as i was expecting it to be. I like the fact that this restaurant does not use fluorescent lighting, since I'm sensitive to light and very clean, very quiet. I would recommend this restaurant if it's your first time eating real Italian food, olive garden isn't real Italian food, and yes i would know since i lived in Italy for about a year.<//review>

I've dined in and ordered takeout. The restaurant is clean, the staff are pleasant and professional, and the food is good although, my Italian boyfriend says that the food is average. An ignorant Filipina such as myself loved the food. The portions are a very good size as well.</text>

<text>Great Italian food!.  Come see the entertainment as well. They provide live music/singing from a guy with a great voice. Sounds like Frank Sinatra and anyone else from that era.  Must see and dine.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< GmapID>

Booths uncomfortable. Service slow. Food was ok, nothing to rave about. Acoustically very noisy and could barely hear the music system over the cacophony.< /Review>

The food was very tasty and you get large portions. Definitely worth the price which wasn't much to begin with. The staff was helpful and courteous. I would eat there again.< /text>

< Review>
Have been going to this place for many years now.  Sadly, the service today was really poor.  I understood that the place was busy, but this was no reason for thw service to have been so poor....very disappointed.  This experience may cause me to not go back.<//Review>

First time at this restaurant. Had a white Coat Ceremony dinner for God Child in Optometry School. The food was divine. The vast menu has a dish for everyone. The food was prepared with fresh ingredients, hot and savory. The portions were large. We were able to enjoy the remaining food for a second meal. I had the chicken Marsala. So tender and the linguini sauce melted in your mouth. My husband had the lazagna prepared old school with fresh beef, thick cheese, hearty sauce and a hint of anised. He said it was the best  he ever had. My God daughter had the clam linguini. It looked moist, lots of pasta with light sauce. My God son had chicken parm. It too looked hearty. He said the meat was tender and there were two portions in one. The service was quick and very friendly. Lovely warm setting to celebrate a great event. Too stuffed to have desert.< /review>

<Text>My crown cracked. They got me in the same day & were able to give me a temporary crown. Will only be one week till my permanent one comes in. The dentist & dental assistant we’re very nice & accommodating to my health care needs. I’d recommend to all my family & friends.</Text>< GmapID>

Horrible scheduling with this clinic during emergency’s. My family has been going to this local clinic for years but their current wait for an urgent root canal is ridiculous. My brother went in 3 days ago with aching pain which they said would be cured with a crown so he went in to get his temporary in. Two days passed and the aching pain started back up and even stronger giving him headaches. Yesterday he went in because of the pain and was told that the “specialist only comes in once a month” and that the earliest they could see him is OCTOBER 1st!!!!? All they said they could do for now is prescribe him a pain medication to deal with the pain for a couple months…. I highly DO NOT recommend this clinic to anyone.< /Review>

<resp>{'time': 1628986026877, 'text': 'Saul, I am sorry your brother is having problems with a tooth. Our root canal specialist spends about a week a month in our office. If scheduling is a problem, we can like most other offices, refer to a specialist in the area. We always give our patients the option of waiting for our in-house specialist, or seeing a local specialist. It is their decision. We would never “make” someone wait over a month when in discomfort. We will follow up with your brother and make sure he is seen in a timely manner.'}</resp>< GmapID>

< review>
I have been going to this dentist for 3 years. I have had horrible expirences with other dentists, so I'm very cautious where I go. They were amazing at first, until I had my front teeth replaced with porcelain crowns. One of them has come off over 6 or 7 times now. I have gone in so many times for the same issue, and it has not been resolved. I offered many chances for them to find a way to fix the issue. Dr Rice never tried anything but to continue to reglue or cement it on. Finally Dr Amathyst took over and did her best but still no luck.  I used the rest of my insurance for the year for this procedure and made it clear that I wanted a refund for the one crown, so I could go to another dentist. Office staff agreed this was an understanble request especially considering how many times I've had to miss work just to come in and stated I would be issued a refund. It has been over two months that I asked for a refund, money that I paid out of pocket, and I continue to get lead around. I made it clear that in order to go to another dentist I would need the refund at, least of the money I paid out of pocket to pay to be seen. I continue to get the run around. To go to work with a missing front tooth is extremely embarrassing. I was never told that this would be a possible issue when the procedure was planned in the first place. This has been an extremely frustrating experience and I have unfortunately lost all respect for this dental office. I've waited and waited to write a review because I don't want to be one of those people, but I thought it was important to share this story so that perhaps someone else will hesitate before getting such an important procedure done at this office.<//review>

This was my first time visiting the office,
I can say I was overall VERY IMPRESSED! The staff was extremely friendly and very informative. I had just a routine cleaning, but I would have to say it has been the best and most detailed cleaning I have ever experienced. They really took their time and explained everything. Not to mention the office was so nice and clean. Very happy with Turlock Family Dentistry & their staff.< /review>

<text>For the first time in five years, I had to wait. When everyone around was called in 15 min after my appointment time, I had to check if I had an appointment. Then, I was called in and seated. It took another 20 minutes till soneone showed up. The schedule change was the reason for my long wait.
Maybe I had to reschedule. I should have kept my orginal morning appointment. Afternoon is not a good idea.
But the hygenist was very good. She was careful with my sensitive spots and cleaned my teeth thoroughly.
It was great that I had least pain on my sensitive spots. I am very happy with her work. I widh she would clean my teeth next time, too.< /text><name>S Y<//name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
The staff in the back are very professional and welcoming. The staff in the front on the other hand aren’t very professional. I had a temp crown on that kept coming off, call the office spoke to an Ana to schedule to come in to have them put it back on but she stated that I could do it myself. I’ve been coming to this palace for years and that employee has always been not friendly to me. Years ago I complained about her but she continues to be rude. There is another older hispanic lady at the front the acts the same way. Love my hygienist and the rest of the staff. Just some honest feedback :)<//Review>

I was so nervous about finding a dentist that I could trust after I moved, and when I found Turlock Family Dentistry I was put to ease! Dr. Amethyst took great care of me, and I met Jennifer the BEST Dental Hygienist that I have ever met! She is not only a sweetheart, but goes above and beyond! She is so empathetic! Great team!< /Text>

The staff is genuine and personable! I moved to a different city and refuse to find a dentist closer. Dr Amethyst and her staff have helped to alleviate so much fear and apprehension, even down to the painless way she administers shots.
I have had anxiety about the dentist for so long and they have helped relieve so much of that. After making a clear achievable dental plan to a healthy smile I am excited to go in for each visit. They even remember the name of my two year old every visit despite him only visiting once! I would keep gushing but you get it right?? I recommended this office to anyone seeking an enjoyable relationship with their dentist.< /text>< rating>

All the staff are friendly and make me feel comfortable in an uncomfortable situation (let's face it who enjoys going to the dentist). Today I had my teeth cleaned by Stephanie and a check up with Dr. Amethyst. They both are wonderful! In these COVID times I feel they are taking great measures to keep all of us safe including only allowing 3 people into the building at a time, screening, wearing masks, taking temps, having us sanitize when we walk in. If you are looking for a dentist office I highly recommend them.< /review>< pics>

ALL of the staff were extremely polite and friendly. They had their COVID protocols down to a T! The office was very nice/clean. Dr. Adamic and his assistant Marie were fantastic.< /Text>

<Text>Love my hygienist. She did an outstanding job on cleaning my teeth and listen to me when I was discussing my concerns about my teeth to her. Off ice staff is very friendly. Doctor Adamic and Dr. Schlecht are both down to earth, professional, caring people. This dental office gives off  good vibes and makes you feel like you had been going there forever.</Text>< Pics>

I was very happy with my visit to TFD. I haven't been to a dentist in a while so I was very scared and nervous. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. They explained everything to me and made me feel really comfortable. The best part is I will soon be able to smile with confidence. Thank you to everyone at Turlock Family Dentistry. I look forward to seeing you again.<//review>

<text>The entire staff in this office is amazing! The ladies here made me feel very welcome and are super friendly. The office is clean and beautiful. I was amazed at all the steps being taken to help reduce the sharing of germs during my visit. I’ve had cleanings by several of the hygienists and each one has been gentle, thorough and all around awesome! I highly recommend Turlock Family Dentistry!</text></record>

< Review>
A snottier, more pretentious group of people Dental Professionals in the San Joaquin Valley would be hard to find. I come from Orange County, CA and never have I experienced attitude like this. 2nd rate work on matching color for an implant restoration didn't help, which chipped within a year. Had 4-5 visits and only saw the doctor (Rice) once. His staff does everything. Apparently I was not important enough to spend any time with. Also had an extraction done and the doctor who performed that procedure was truly Medieval. I have had many extractions over the years but nothing like this. Answer to TFD Response: I had trouble with the extraction site for months. Maybe he did not crack my jaw, I did not have it ex-rayed. But the work was done hurriedly and as I said I have never ever experienced anything like this. As far as me "asking to see the Doctor", I should not have had to. That is how I felt and why I did not ask. Again, I have never paid for dental services where all the work was done by people with "expanded duties" and not a doctor. And Scott at the front desk was plain rude. He smirked at his co-workers when I approached and would not meet my eyes when dealing with me.<//Review>

Our office employs assistants who have "extended functions" and experience doing certain procedures, which a lot of offices do not.  If you wanted/needed to speak with the doctor at any time, all you had to do was ask.  As for your experience with our specialist: although the extraction of your tooth might have been complicated, we can assure you that the specialist did not "crack your jaw".

<text>I had an emergency with a tooth that had abcessed.
Their team here at TFD was all over it. Making sure that I was seen today first thing and then getting me a referral to an outside Dentist office that could do a root canal right away.
Dr A and her team are simply the best.

<Text>The entire team at Turlock Family Dentistry is amazing! I've had a lot of work done, so I've seen every doctor there. From root canals, implants, invisiline and regular checkups, hands down best dental care I've ever received.
I've had after hour emergencies and even needed them on a holiday, and Dr. Rice has always provided me the care I've needed.  Yesterday I had an emergency (labor day) and Kimberly came to the rescue. I love this  office and team. From the front desk staff to every assistant and doctor, I'll never go anywhere else!  Thank you for always being the best and there for my family & I.<//Text>< pics>

Cherie was great. I had a deep cleaning. Cherie gave the best shots. She was very conscientious while doing the procedure. Everyone in the office is wonderful - knowledgeable,  friendly, plus a really inviting atmosphere. Hope to get my parents in there. Highly recommend.</text>

<review>Took my daughter in and this was our first visit. We entered and were immediately greeted by a friendly receptionist. The office is beautiful, clean, and has the highest technology. We were then called and escorted back by Marie. She made us feel so welcomed and proceeded to give us a grand tour since we were new. Marie was so sweet, and took her time with my daughter and thoroughly explained everything. We then met Michelle (hygienist) and she was super friendly. Dr. Amethyst was very upbeat, knowledgeable, and nice. I highly recommend this dentist and look forward to taking my whole family there.<//review>< pics>

Everyone is friendly and polite. The endodontost was great at testing my tooth for a root canal (meaning he didn’t hit it with cold water to see what level of reaction I gave). There were procedures and equipment to protect against covid-19 for myself and the employees. The endo kept asking me if I was doing alright during the procedures. If I didn’t already have a dentist that I like going to already, I’d be coming to Turlock Family Dentistry.< /Text>

This office is not accommodating to their patients. It’s like going to the DMV. I’ve been wearing Invisalign  trays for over a year now, every single appointment is the same. I wait longer in the waiting room than I do in the actual “appointment”. I get handed my trays, I try them on, I say thank you and I leave. Less than two minute interaction. (I never see the actual DENTIST) here’s what I’ve experienced..I just delivered a baby 4 days prior to my appointment and I asked if I or my husband could pick up my new trays, NOPE..Had to come in for my “appointment.” Second negative experience.. My new set of trays that are ready sitting in the office will continue to sit there for 10 more days for their next available appointment. I will have gone 20 days with no retainers in my mouth.. “can’t” pick them up and try on at the desk.. I guess my teeth will continue to shift daily. Like I said ran like a DMV. Once I’m finished I will find a new dentist office!< /Text>

<date>1548382016532< /date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Great customer service and skilled doctors and technicians! Staff is kind and patient, completely explain procedures and payment processes. Highly recommend this practice!

Today was my second visit here and I was extremely anxious going into my appointment because I knew I would have to get shots to numb my mouth. I was even tearing up a bit by the time I got into the chair, but as soon as the woman who was supposed to give me the shots walked in she immediately made me feel more comfortable. She let me know everything that was going on with the shots - told me where I'd feel the numbing and let me know my heart rate might increase or I'd feel jittery and that it was just the medicine. She was really great and talked about my job and and her family and was honestly so sweet and it seemed effortless. I was there to replace silver amalgam fillings that were poorly done by a previous dentist and were visible in my smile line. I'm completely satisfied with my new white fillings that blend so naturally with my teeth and feel smooth and even. Again, I'll definitely be recommending this dental office! 😁<//review>< pictures>

I love the friendly staff who work at Turlock Family Dentistry. Also, Dr. Rice is amazingly gentle with his hands when working on my teeth and very easy to talk with about treatment. Everyone I’ve interacted with has taken the time to answer any questions I might have.<//Text>

Hi Jeff,

I wanted to share with you that each time any member of our family  visits your office, we notice a connected energy between you and all of your team members.  It is something we can’t fully capture with words, but we feel and see it.
Like with any business, I’m sure there are day-to-day challenges, but because we see the same faces time after time, it tells us that your employees want to be there, and are doing what they love to do alongside you.
Your friendly, professional demeanor has been a constant, and plays a big part in our continued trust and faith in what all of you do for us.  Our many thanks to you and your team for taking such great care of us over the years!

With Gratitude,

Mike, Beth, Hannah & Sophia</Text>

<Text>Love this office. The staff is great and I have been very satisfied with the finished product.  My bite is natural and everything feels right after they take care of my dental needs. They send text messages and emails to me as reminders for follow up appointments (which I need and appreciate). If I have ever had to reschedule it has NEVER been a problem. They are a very busy office but always accommodating. I don't give reviews like this lightly. I am one tough customer so they have gone above and beyond to win over this gal!<//Text>< Pictures>

I just started as a patient at Turlock Family Dentistry after leaving a dentist I had been with for 19 years. I have some lingering fears of the dentist and so I was nervous about starting with a whole new office. I couldn't be more pleased with the wonderful dental care and customer service provided!
The entire staff was extremely friendly and solicitous around patient comfort and satisfaction. Dr. Rices's chair side manner was outstanding. After I explained the reason for my nervousness, he frequently checked on my comfort level throughout the visit.
I ended up having several procedures done - checkup, cleaning, teeth whitening, and replacement of two crowns - over a series of visits. All the staff members who provided services carefully explained what to expect and appeared very detailed-oriented around each procedure.
I would highly recommend this office to anyone in need of dental care.< /text>

<Review>This is a wonderful place! First and foremost, they are professional and do a wonderful job in all areas. What sets them apart is their professionalism when checking you out billing you and trying to help you whenever they can. If for some reason you’re stuck on a payment they work with you. They’ve even been very generous. I can’t say enough about them you won’t be disappointed!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I really appreciate the awesome service. They give you a tour around their dentistry and show awesome hospitality. Dr. Rice is very kind, talkative, even funny, which helps take your mind off the fact that your at the dentist, which is always frightening to me! They take good care of you and are well at informing you about your overall dental heath. I appreciated their help and would definitely make it my official dentistry!</Review>

<Review>UPDATE: Today's visit was horrible. The assistant was so unpersonal. She was very rough and not comforting. She rushed thru my cleaning and didn't say anything positive (or negative) about my dental health. I also never saw the main dentist at all during this visit! I've always, my whole life, seen the dentist each time I've gotten a cleaning and/or exam. The overall dentistry is slacking in their operations. After my exam, I called my insurance to submit a complaint, and I also learned that I was covered for a Fluoride rinse (which is a min. 70$ cost thru insurance) and they didn't offer it to me. This is listed on my record and should be offered by the dentist, regardless of my knowledge. I plan on never going back and finding another dentist. My mother as well. If anyone trys them out, don't be fooled by the first impression. I wouldnt refer this dentist to a friend or an enemy.</Review>< username>

Exams are typically done once a year, unless you are having an issue/problem. If you would have liked to speak to the doctor, all you had to do was ask. Just because the fluoride rinse is covered by your insurance company, we don’t automatically recommend/offer it unless we feel it is warranted. I will have our office manager follow up with you to address your concerns.'}<//Response>

<text>This was my last appointment for Invisalign! Yeah! I got my retainers delivered yesterday and my teeth are beautiful. That’s just the added bonus to aligning my teeth and bite correctly so I stop chipping and wearing them down. And it took only 8 months! Thank you Turlock Family Dentistry!

The office staff is friendly and extremely competent as well as the hygienist and technician who worked on my teeth. Dr. Jeffrey Rice is amazingly skilled at how he gracefully and easily worked on my molar, preparing it for a crown. I was never in any pain or discomfort of any kind. I highly recommend this office for patients of all ages.<//review>< response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Very friendly place.
Place is very clean and high tech.
I always hated going to the dentist and would be so tense when getting my teeth clean that I would cancel appointments until I started going the Family dental.
I am never tense totally relaxed and don't mind going to the dentist now. I even asked when they were done "was that it? "
Anyone looking for a dentist I would highly recommend this place.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Experience was great. Turlock Family Dentistry is very clean and has an expansive area to accommodate all of its patients. I was very pleased with my visit, my wait time was very short even though I was a new patient. I was given a tour of their facilities and given information on additional services they offer (Invisalign). Dr. Rice spoke with me after my cleaning to follow up on overall oral health. I left feeling very content, I'm so glad I went there!< /Review><resp>{'time': 1530249325144, 'text': 'We are glad you came here too!

Comfort, pain management, and sharing knowledge of what they are doing throughout your visit makes things easier and beneficial during your time there. The office staff is very helpful and go above and beyond most other practices. They serve all ages and take really good care of children during their visits, so it's not scary for first timers. They also give you text updates and reminders. If you need to reschedule or cancel an appointment, they give you options through text messages. It's an amazing practice with a great staff. I highly recommend checking them out, especially if it's been a while since you had your teeth looked at. They will take great care of you.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< time>

<text>Very efficient, very professional staff. Dr. & hygienists were very thorough, & patient. Very kind. My 8 year old & I had an appointment in the morning. We were seen back to back. My child FEARS dentists, but she did wonderful, beyond what I expected at this dental office. Amethyst, the oral hygienist sure made my child feel welcome. Never had I seen my child so comfortable before! We're due to go back in a month for treatment. We're both truly looking forward to that day. Thanks Dr. Rice, thanks ladies!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Very professional, caring, gentle. Definitely a great experience every time.

New review, new great experience!   Every time I am extremely pleased  with the outstanding care everyone at Turlock Family Dentistry provides.
I have received care from Dr. Rice, Dr. Schlecht and Dr. Kim, prophylaxis and xrays by Stephanie for the last 5 years, very amazing professionals.
I gladly have referred friends to this office, and will continue to do so, every chance I see someone in need of dental care.<//Text>

Their facility is clean and modern, with an informative and welcoming staff. Dr. Schlect has been my favorite dentist for years now. She's straightforward, positive, and even went out of her way to check in with me on her personal time after I had a dental emergency during a holiday weekend. I would definitely recommend.< /Text>

Unbelievably very pleasant. My crown fit was beautiful! They were excellent to continue asking how I was doing and I had confidence in them and the technologies they use.

I have been to many dentists but I have never been to a place that is so nice, clean and professional! Dr. David Adamic, he knows what he is doing he explained detail by detail what was going on, always checking on how I was doing!!! Did an amazing job and I could not be more pleased! So blessed to have him as my dentist!!! If you are looking for a new dentist, book with him!!!< /text>

<Text>If I could rate this place a negative I would. Dr. Shellinck was great, but the office staff is beyond awful. While waiting for my son in surgery i could here the front desk lady yelling out different patients names followed by their social security numbers and the medications they were taking. Apparently she was on speaker phone. When i approached her to let her know i could hear everything, she told me it wasnt my concern.
Next i recieved a bill that was $1200.00 after i had confirmed I only owed $178.00. When i called ,Scott told me I had only recieved an estimate. When I told him 1200 off is not an estimate. He then told me my insurance didnt cover the procedure. I reminded him that I sat with him when he called my insurance to see what was covered and my balance. He said he would have to wait until the billing lady came back. Which will be in a week because she is on vacation.
I called my insurance who is "in network" with them.
They stated they had already paid the claim and i only owed $178.00. They told me not to pay anything else and this office has done this before. My insurance lady called Turlock Family dentistry while i was on the line and all of a sudden the billing lady will be in the next day. Not a week from when i was told. Place is crooked. My insurance company Aetna has filed a complaint. Be aware!!!
Oh. And I read the other reviews that stated they have done this insurance scam before. I hope they dont respond like the other reviews with " Sorry you feel the way you do" That is not an apology! And don't say you'll " Be happy to discuss and go over the bill with me". Because they did and still lied.</Text>< Response>
{'time': 1571169348694, 'text': 'Thanks for your response.  You might want to follow up with your insurance company, as we did after receiving your review.  It seems that your insurance company, and not us, made a mistake in processing your claim. We only bill for procedures preformed, and take any insinuation of fraud very seriously.  We have requested transcripts of your phone conversation with your insurance company be reviewed by their management team (they do record all phone inquiries) to see if the agent actually said "this office has done this before" and that a complaint was truly filed.  We are awaiting their review. In the meantime, we would be happy to discuss what they actually told us about the claim and how no deception/fraud was committed by our office.'}< /Response>

The dentists there are so friendly and down to earth.

The service is great. But not their crowns they don't last long. I had to replace 2 crowns on my right side over a year  ago maybe going on 2 and  have not been able to chew on that side is painful. So I have to use my left side to chew. Now I was told that I need to replace one on the left side. I'm scarred just to think of it.<//review>

<Review>I would definitely recommend Turlock Family Dentistry. I had a root canal done this morning by them, (this is my 3rd root canal; first one by them), and the Dr. was very good about walking me through everything step by step, that they were doing. They were always asking how i was doing and were very attentive (as uposed to some places that work on two or more patients at a time) Lastly, there was no wait in the waiting room (although i DID have an appointment :-)), and as far as root canals go, my proceedure was done in a timely manner (compared to my last 2 which took two and a half and three hours). I would tell my friends and family to go here for their dentistry needs.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1497541578609, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review Jaclyn!

<text>I did not like it, because 4 months ago they put me a crown and since I got the job and had pain and gone to consultation 5 times for the same problem and could not solve anything. Another thing is that Dr. Rice's assistant is very aggressive and the last time she fitted the nail and hurt a lot.
We also pay the bill in full and receive one more with another extra balance. (????) I do not know what it is.</text>< Pics>

<Review>We decided to try Turlock Family Dentistry after having a series if awful dental work done with another dentist. Not only were they great with my kids who were so loud and sometimes in the way, they addressed every concern I had for all of my kids and myself. My boys who have special needs were so happy after and their experience was unlike any other. They were excited to get a prize for doing well. I was happy with how Dr. Amethyst addressed all of my concerns and I left with information that really helped me get an understanding of the invisalign, whitening,  and other treatments I wanted. I would recommend this dentist office to anyone. The front staff, the assistants, the hygienist, and the dentist are outstanding. Can't get a better service than what they have to offer.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
2 hours after listed opening time still not able to  get ahold of the office to make an  appointment.  Gets forwarded to a call center which is unable to help. They say they can take a message and email it over to the office. What's the point of listing opening and close times if you don't adhere to them.</Review>

< Review>
Had a wonderful cleaning experience with Jennifer today. Now I never in my 50+ years thought I'd be using wonderful as an adjective to describe a cleaning experience. With all the neglect and outright damage I've done to these "not so pearly whites anylonger"  I've grown to absolutely fear the visit to the dentist  and have been known to need anxiety medication to make it to...and through the ordeal. Even the sounds in a dental office give me goosebumps...no kidding...but today, Jennifer went beyond kind and was engaging which took my mind off the procedure and when we did talk shop she was positive and helpful. I've had many similar visits at TFD and am so grateful that I found such a professional facility that treats each patient as an individual with specific needs and medical conditions. Thanks guys...for doing such an outstanding job in a day when many businesses have a managment protocol that doesn't take in to account the differences in patients/clients and their needs. May you all have a blessed Christmas and...see ya next year!
Peace to all,
Cynthia Brawley</Review>

They gave us a bill. It was paid in full. Then we get a new bill a month later with additional charges.  They must either have really dumb customers, or staff.  These are some of the reasons they told us the bill was modified:

1. The first was just a quote
2. It was our fee for using gas
3. It was for our deductible

We called insurance and they told us each was incorrect.  We call the office on 3 way with Cigna and the manager hangs up after insurance sets her straight. Seems like crooks so we are reporting this as Fraud with BBB, and listing this on all outlets that someone may see so you do not get frauded also. Good luck. If this has happemed toyou, check with insurance and dispute.  It was only for 50 bucks so I am thinking they hope it goes unnoticed.good luck!< /text>

TFD, the Augustus name is simply a nickname given in university to me. Your rebuttal below assures me I made the right decision in finding another dentist.

For others in Turlock, my original review said this:

Because of unnecessary procedures done on me as a child, I have had dental problems throughout my adult life. This has made me very leery of dentists and it is very hard for me to know which dentists really wish the best for your health versus those who wish to do as many procedures possible so that they can enlarge their bottom line.
When I moved to Turlock about eight years ago, I needed to find a dentist locally that I could trust and decided to try Turlock Family Dentistry and Dr Jeffery Rice because a few other people told me that he was decent. So, I made an appointment and visited his office for a cleaning and initial inspection.
During that initial appointment, I was pushed to have a deep cleaning (the dental world calls this Root Planing and Scaling). Dr Jeffery Rice it turns out missed a small localized infection above one bicuspid. Perhaps it is just me, but I also found Dr Rice to be mildly enacius. During my second visit for a cleaning six months later, I was again pushed to have a deep cleaning. Beginning to grow suspicious, I went to two other dentists in Turlock and had second opinions. I found, I did not need a deep cleaning and that I had a small cavity that Dr Rice had missed.
Overall, I did not have the best experience with TFD. They have a dedicated business office attached to their practice and as soon as they figure out who you are and if you have a decent dental plan, they will begin telling you that you have "unused" dental coverage. And it seems, that if you fall into this group, then you will be mildly pestered by them for different types of procedures that may not be necessary (like deep cleanings). I am fortunate to have an excellent dental plan and every time I came, the office staff suggested I have either teeth whitening or deep cleanings.
Dr Rice also has wisely set up his entire practice so profits are maximized, because Dr Adamic, Dr Schellinck and others all work under one roof. At first this seems ideal because you never need to leave TFD to go to a specialist anywhere else. But the downside is that if you have a complaint, and that specialist is only there one day every two weeks then it can be difficult to settle a matter.
TFD is also at the high end of the market in what they charge for a specific procedure. Whether that be a cleaning, a cavity or a crown. I inquired for example with Dr Schellinck about getting a dental implant and the total cost for that molar position would have been about $5600. However, numerous other respected dentists in Turlock will do the same job for about $3200 to $4800, .... a major savings.
Picking a dentist is a personal decision and for me, I just came away feeling a little bit like Dr Rice is more interested in financing his next camper bus or his second home than he is in making sure I have great dental health. Your mileage may vary but never fear picking up a second or third opinion. I did, and I can highly recommend either Dr Antoine Varani or Dr Robert Mcculla in Turlock.<//text>
<pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1492033441003, 'text': 'Jay Hall, or Aurelius Augustus, or whatever your name really is.... a little advice.....you lose a lot of "review credibility" when you post reviews from experiences 8 years ago and under multiple alias\' instead of your real name.  That being said, we at Turlock Family Dentistry stick to our response to your initial review of our office which you posted under "Aurelius Augustus"; in that we have never had a Jay Hall or Aurelius Augustus as a patient of record.   At Turlock Family Dentistry we base our treatment recommendations on visual and radiographic evidence, not educational levels.  Finally, since you deleted your initial review of our office and our response under your alias of Aurelius Augustus; for everyone else here is how we responded to that review:\n"We at Turlock Family Dentistry value and appreciate all of our great patients, and take all reviews very seriously. Although it appears from your review that you came to our office 8 years ago (Dr. Rice did not own the practice 8 years ago), we would love to address the claims you made in your review yesterday ("When I moved to Turlock about eight years ago, I needed to find a dentist locally that I could trust and decided to try Turlock Family Dentistry and Dr. Jeffery Rice").  Unfortunately we have had no patient of record named Aurelius Augustus (or Jay Hall for that matter); and therefore cannot verify that you were even a patient of ours now, or 8 years ago.  If you were indeed a patient of record, and/or are just using an alias to post a negative review, please call our office so we can adequately address your concerns.  Thank you.
