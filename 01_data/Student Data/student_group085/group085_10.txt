Customer service was very little to none. Cashier just pointed and leaned on the register while ringing us up. No lie!!! Please review store video. Sad that some locations with great service closed while others stay open< /review>

My son wanted Luigi’s Mansion for his Switch, so with school cancelled I thought it wouldn’t be a bad investment.

Lindsey greeted me as I walked in and immediately began looking on the sales floor/wall for my item. Sold out was the verdict; however, a used copy was available for five bucks less!

A very helpful team.</text>

Gamestop is a great gaming, and gaming accessories store that could accommodate all of your video gaming needs and desires. With brand new as well as used equipment- Gamestop I'd say it's the gamers headquarters for the modern Nerd.</Review>

I happened to call the store. And they explained that they would bring the came to the door if I bought it online. So I did just that. Waiting in the rain for an hour. And there system says them don't see it. Clearly on my bank statement it shows they took my money. I got a confirmation email with number. And there system still doesn't show. I am sitting here in the rain. Possibility of getting sick among what is going on in the world. For a 16 dollar Nintendo switch game. In the rain mind you. You gladly are quick to take my money. Not happy.<//text>

Had some questions about a used game. Great employee helping me said they didn't have it, but checked other stores online, and even called another nearby store to reserve the used copy they had for me. Awesome guy, with an awesome beard.

Some other moody employee lurking around behind him reared his head, shook out his greasy ponytail, and  aggresively suggested l go buy the game at Walmart instead.

So I did. 10/10 advice. Got what I wanted and it was cheaper.

The one terrible employee means I'll never go back.<//review>

< Review>
I wanted to buy a deluxe edition of a game that wasn't being sold anywhere but at this specific Gamestop, so I called ahead to reserve and they said they'll hold it for a day. I visit around the afternoon with a friend to pick up the game, only to be told that it was out of stock. I literally wasted 50 minutes of my life driving to this place from the desert, only to find that the game I reserved had been given to someone else.

So despite my disappointment I decided to just get the regular edition....I mean, Im not the type to stay angry about things, plus I know that computers don't reflect something is in stock or not on time, (except wait, I forgot, I CALLED the place and they said they would have it for me,
and they didn't!!!)....... all the while, the employee that was helping me that day somehow had the audacity to tell me in a sarcastic manner that it was MY fault for not pre-ordering, or that I should ALWAYS pre-order games (tip: if you preorder games, there's a high chance the price will be lowered some time later for a sale, or they'll have an extra edition in the future, with all its dlcs and extras at half the cost. I don't recommend preordering, I already learned my lesson the first time. You all decide what you want to do with your life.)Then, after we made the transaction, he starts reading off a list of games that I could pre-order in a super-demanding attitude, like "you better pre-order now or else," and it honestly took me aback. Did someone not make your coffee right today, or are you just a natural asshat? Also, are we forgetting the fact that YOU were the one who told me via phone that my copy was reserved, only to give it away? I should NOT be blamed for your mistake & SURELY not in such a rude manner. You could have just told me politely that I could try pre-ordering, but no, you insulted me and made me feel like an idiot, when you were the one with the problem!

This is my first and last time visiting this Gamestop. There are better gamestops out there who treat their customers better, unlike this one.<//Review>

< Review>
Was a regular customer. My husband and I always go to this game stop and are very friendly but today the manager, Derrick, was rude to us. We wanted to return a game we purchased 2 days ago but was unhappy with the price they were offering. We paid $60+ for th game and they said we would get $19 for it. My husband was very unhappy and expressed calmly how unfair that was to an employee who agreed. The manager then comes out aggressively and yells at us about how we should know it’s unfair. We were shocked and  offended at how rude he was talking to us. My husband got very upset and yelled back at him. Derrick could have expressed in a calmer manner how the policy works.</Review>

I was grieving it was my uncles birthday ! and has past for 20 years I was very bummed out , And so amazing I got a call , like it was a friend . high roman this is hunter Prescott just a courtesy call that you can pick up your pre-order on April 22 just be sure to be here before 8:30 p.m. or you can come in at anytime the next day , I was frozen to death from happiness in complete shock . I feel I have been waiting for this for three months already I am dying to see my collection , I do have to give a shot out to Michael he sold me MLB 2019 which is a wonderful Game loads of entertainment and fun ! now my best review is saved for last the store owner I believe when I payed for Sekiro it was sort of a big deal I had to be I.D. and answer some small questions which actually was interesting when the owner was happy I pre-ordered it , he told me I picked up the last copy and I get a letter opener with it too ! he was smiling and very cheerful and motivating . especially with mortal Kombat 11 it was the same deal last copy , so thats was so funny . just luck ! I really like the shirts they sell , I get a lot of comments and send them here . and keychains with adapters and keychains with Rugrats widgets on it and a Broly XXL size pin from dragon ball z and as for Tekken, Marvel vs dc comics , dragon ball z collectors items are fantastic! AND GREAT GAMES ALONG WITH MADDEN 2017 BUT I AM LOOKING TO UPRGADE FOR THE NEW VERSION NEXT YEAR AND WAITING FOR MLS AND GETTING NBA 2020 OR SOMETHING GOOD ON THAT ! I really do look forward to seeing Michael , Hunter , and Derek they are excellent staff members and hard workers . I am really bad with names to remember all the employees but they are very respectful and solid in their gaming division I am thinking about division 2 but I am really amazed how awesome destiny 2 is and never regret buying that edition it was 2016 in fall and I love my system I am looking to trade in my Xbox one original for the new one coming out at the end of may 6 more weeks ! CRAZY !  I cant wait to see what happens . Thanks Hunter Prescott for the call and update . I really appreciate it Prestige Gamestop store .<//Review>

<Text>If I could give it a zero, I would.  My son wanted to trade in a bunch of games and get c.o.d. ghost.  Having dealt with Game Stops in three different states and having bad experiences, I told him to call ahead to see what they would give him for all of his stuff. He was close to his goal for the other game with all the games he was trading in, but then he found his 3DS and a game and called them back.  He was told that in "good condition" it would be worth $50 and the game for it was worth another $10, that's all he needed (especially with their "additional 30%" deal) so we headed on over there (without all the other games, of course).  We get there and the guy tells us he'll give us $36.  If I could post a picture of this 3DS to show the condition I would gladly do that.  The guy tried to tell me he would have to send it in to be "refurbished"...whatever.  Then I asked how much they would turn around and sell it for, he said $150.  This place is a joke. Bait and Switch at it's finest.<//Text>< user>

This is a busy game stop, average wait time is 20 min. I went here to get a used PS4 controller, was only a $3 difference from brand new, I asked them if they had any, and they didn't tell me the price they just rang me up. Whatever, I guess, I just won't be coming back.< /Review>

This store is extremely unprofessional and I wouldn't send your kids there to spend money. They will most likely be turned away and questioned about childcare.</text>

<text>Absolutely a terrible experience, I would give 0 stars if I could.  I Pre-ordered the Xbox one sunset overdrive bundle back in July to be released 10/28. I called the day it was released to inform store #1627 that I was in another state for work and asked if they would hold for me since I would be returning to California 11/02.  I was told by a male that they would put a note on the console and hold it because I was out of town. I showed up and there was only one person working, with one person in the back room doing nothing even though, there was a line of 8 people waiting so I had to wait 30-35 minutes just to be told they sold my bundle. This place is run by a bunch of amateurs and now I have to wait 10 more days for something I "Pre-ordered"< /text>< pictures>

Had to wait a while in line whilst two employees seemingly sat on their fingers in the break room. When finally served, the employee felt the need to lay his opinion on me, "Oh, Zelda Majora's Mask for 3DS? I've never played a Zelda game in my life but i've heard this is awful".
A) You have no place to comment on a game series you've never played.
B) There isn't a bad review online, how have you been employed when you clearly know nothing about the industry.< /Review>

< Review>
I traded in a bunch of games and was happy with what they bought them for. I used that money to buy a new wii-u. I bought new because I am skeptical of pre-owned, Mychal who worked there even further convinced me to not buy pre-owned too. They only had the wii-u bundle with mariocart. Mychal told me that I could just trade the Mario cart game back in and it would be similar to just buying the wii-u without a bundle. Ended up doing that and now I come to learn that the game is pre-installed. Called today and they won't let me return or exchange it. In the end I feel like I was educated poorly on what console I was getting and was pushed to buy the product. Not too thrilled about that. So far every GameStop experience that I've had has been below average. Would really recommend going to bestbuy or target instead of GameStop for games and consoles.< /Review>

I lost 50 lbs in 2 years with the guidance of the kind folks at United Fitness. They take a personalized approach with every client. They push you beyond what you think you're capable of and show you how much stronger, more flexible, and stamina you actually have inside of you. I'm also not an outlier. If you follow the diet closely, exercise regularly , and sleep well consistently - your fat will be replaced with muscle. I've seen this with most of the people around me who go on a regular basis. It works if you're willing to do as they say. It's as simple as that! Start your body transformation today. Don't wait another minute.<//Text>

The challenge is to lose 20 in 6 weeks and get your money back so all the training is free. I lost the 20+ pounds. At first I thought the diet had too much food in it. The diet was really easy the only hard part was preparing all the food for a week ahead of time but that really pays off because many times throughout the week you don't have time to cook/ eat right . So I followed the plan and the weight just came off. The exercise program is really cool because for the whole 6 weeks I never did the same routine twice. We worked Every muscle group. The work-outs are only 30 min long but they are as difficult as you push yourself. I liked that they have 12 different start times for the group classes Mon - Fri from 4:00 am to 7:45 pm and 4 classes Sat and Sun mornings. You can go every day as many times as you want. The trainers are really a good bunch of guys they demonstrate the proper form and technique for every exercise before you do them and they help out people with their form constantly. That really helps since you're always doing different exercises. They use a good mix of weights and body-weight exercises.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
A friend of mine referred me to United Fitness, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I have been unmotivated because of long work hours and little time and as a result, I have a lot more fat on my body than normal.  The thought of being able to lose at least 4% body fat in just 6 weeks and the fact that I only need to work out about 35 minutes a day excited me. The first moment I stepped inside, my mouth dropped.  The paint job on the walls are amazing and the music makes me want to dance nonstop.  This is definitely way better than any other gym or fitness club I've been to.  It's much more fun, but they're serious about getting you the results you're looking for.  The trainers are so friendly and always willing to help.  I'm super shy, but everyone there makes me feel so comfortable.  The workouts are awesome and they go by so quickly! You definitely come out of there feeling amazing.  I've just started my challenge and already I'm feeling the difference!  I'm definitely looking forward to every workout and excited for my bikini body!<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>United Fitness is awesome. The trainers are amazing and the other gym members that join you in each class are great. Everyone is friendly and supportive. If you do the 6 week challenge, you are accountable for your effort and results, but the trainers are there to motivate you- and that really does help push you. Every time you come in, you see familiar faces and it sort of becomes like this group or "family" that you count on seeing each day. You don't want to disappoint yourself or them. If you're having trouble pushing through a workout, trust that these people will cheer you on and keep you going. The trainers provide you with an easy to follow diet plan that you put together in a weekly prep, and each training session is only 30-35 minutes so it's not time consuming if you're really busy. If you have any questions or concerns, the trainers are on it. There are various exercises they go through and each person can adjust as necessary to get the full benefit and effect of the workout. You will see results. Definitely worth it.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2aaedd71d693:0xd01d2ac04cb50de</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The trainers are very good at motivating you without intimidating you. I was completely out of shape after 15 years of couch potato status and a very sedentary life style. I have a 2 hour daily commute and a 10 hour work day where I sit for a majority of the day. I have steadily gained weight and am more than 60 pounds over my ideal weight. When I get home, I am too tired to workout on my own. Therefore, I needed a push and the 6 week challenge was perfect for me. The first workout was very challenging but after 4 weeks, I am much more comfortable and feel my self getting stronger every day. I am half way to my goal of a 20 pound weight loss for the challenge. I have lost more than 8 inches from my waist but the feeling of accomplishing a work out and diet with a minimum amount of effort is very rewarding. The diet is tailored for your specific needs and is completely doable without any hunger pains. In fact most of the time have to force myself to eat all the food. United Fitness is awesome and it works if you follow their guidelines. I highly recommend it!!.<//review>< user>

I truly love this place. I wanted to get in shape for my wedding and the trainers at united fitness helped me create a goal and work towards accomplish it. The workouts are only 30 minutes so they are short and sweet but they will truly work you out. The challenge of losing 20 pounds in only six weeks seems like a lot, but it is something that with the help of the trainers you can totally do. The greatest part for me has been the community. There are people from all walks of life and all ages and we all come together to get our workout on. The support is what truly makes this fitness program work.</Text>

I went to meet Josh once after seeing their add on Facebook and it is close my house..
I also checked reviews in yelp.
They explained everything n told I need to deposit 494 $ n if I win they will transfer the money. We were in confusion whether to put that amount but these guys gave false hope that it's very easy to loose 5% to 6% if I come 3 to 4 times a week maintain the given diet and mentioned that 90 %  who sign up actually wins. So I thought If I come 4 times and maintain diet i would win.
I went around 5 times n followed the diet very strict.
I lost the fat at the beginning 3 % very fast but later it was going up and down. Then they mentioned don't look at the scale it doesn't matter.
So I believed them( again false hope).
At the end I finally lost after losing around 4% so I lost the deposit money..
They told if I join gym I get discounted cost of 59.99 $+( 40$ from deposit) whick makes 100$.
This is like I lost the deposit( 494$) money.

Now I feel cheated by false hope. I now think that I would not have joined this challenge. I would have joined normal gyms n lost like 1% fat per month in a healthy way which cost around 20$ and they don't steal your money like this.
So please don't join unless you have a lot to loose.
Or else just you want to donatr 500$ to run their business.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dd2aaedd71d693:0xd01d2ac04cb50de<//gmapID></record>

<text>I signed up for the 6 week challenge and hit the goal withing 2 weeks.. this was well documented and the gym leaders knew this.  I then needed to make this last til my weigh in day which was on a monday. So 11 days before my final weekend was the last I heard from my "accountability" partner and it was a message that just said great job, it has been great watching you succeed.... no reminder for the final weigh in and no mention of it...no "cant wait to see what you weigh in at on Mon." ...nothing.I was out of town on that last weekend before my weigh in and got sick. I missed my last day due to being sick... no "hey where were you" from my accountability partner....I text them on Tuesday saying I was sick and that I would try to make it in that day.... no word.... ended up finally coming in on Wednesday. No one says anything and my accountability partner wasnt in.. I noticed my card was  charged which I thought was odd since I seemed to get a "great job" message two weeks before making it sound as if I had completed my goal and no word after that and everyone knew I hit my goal, turns out because I was sick and missed my final weigh in , I did not qualify to keep my money... my "accountability" person didnt even bother to attempt to hold me accountable.... ultimately my fault, but this place will pretend to be your buddy...but heads up... the accountability portion will ghost you if you are clearly not in danger of failing ....they have to make money and they prefer to screw you , then to have a happy life long client.
Just beware, dont get sick... if you are throwing up or worse...come in , bring a bucket and do it while you weigh in on your final day, and dont trust your accountability partner.... they dont hold you accountable or even remind you of the most important day. There seems to be a lack of communication. On your contract they tell you of your final weigh in but do not stress the importance and 6 weeks down the line I would hope my accountability partner could mention it at least 1 more time reminding me of the importance of the weigh in day, again I missed it, so essentially it is my fault but I'm here to let them know that if you have 100 clients you are monitoring and can still take the time to say hey, you're doing great. I feel its just as easy to remind the group of us, "dont forget your weigh in day" and ask if any of us have questions to prepare ourselves. This is about being a team and pushing everyone to want to succeed and accountability coaches want that for you, even if the end of the day they dont make lots of money but get to keep you as a client. I mentioned this to him and he said he cant remind everyone.... 2 things then ....1. Dont say you are an accountability partner and 2. Yes you could have! ... 1 group text and it isnt 100 different dates .... everyone is coming in around the same time.... so pick a Friday send the text reminding us of the next week... or physically say it, or write it on a whiteboard that we could see walking in and out of the gym. However that isnt what they want...

Their business model is strange... rather than keep me, easily for years to come and me happily giving them way more money in the long game.... they chose short sided, quick,  stealing of my cash that leaves them making less money and leaving me to be upset and outside of this review say nothing about this place. If I owned this place I would have offered a compromise ... like hey, it is no secret and we have loads of proof you had reached your goal... but sick or not you didnt make the final day. However we did fail you by not bothering to even talk to you for 2 weeks at the most crucial time... so .... we give you the discounted rate that you earned but you have to pay the year upfront so you are locked in here. ...not only would I have taken that deal, I woulda been happy to take that deal and prolly paid 2 years in advance and wouldnt have stopped telling people about this place..... o well, they are happy taking the money they took and I will happily give it to another place.<//text>< date>

Just finished my 6 week challenge here and it was awesome!  I loved that they had 5am workouts. The trainers all kicked my butt every morning.  By the end of the 6 week 20 lb challenge I completed that and then some! I lost 26.1 lbs. 2 inches off my waist and 2 % body fat. Still tons more work to be done but a great way to kick start my fitness journey.  I definitely recommend it! It will be tough but definitely worth it in the end!!<//Review>

<review>I joined United Fitness just over 3 weeks ago as part of a trial. I truly love the trainers, the workouts and other gym members. Finding my core strength and motivation once again!

I love united fitness, it was the best decision I made. Its not like any other gym they encourage you to lose weight and to meet your goal. I was doing a body fat challenge at work and I talked to the manager, Devin and told him my situation. I was working out before but I can only push myself so far and United Fitness gave me that push I need. I joined there body fat challenge. And they helped me beat both challenges, I beat there challenge and my jobs challenge. I lost a total of 22lbs and 9% body fat in 12 weeks. I highly recommend this place to anyone who trying to lose weight or get toned. There programs work and there staff in awesome. You won't be disappointed!!!<//text>

I've been working out at United Fitness since January 2015, and I love it, I don't see myself working at any other fitness center but here. I've never been into fitness before I joined United Fitness, and now I can't go a day without working out. The staff is very friendly and approachable with any questions or concerns one may have. The trainers will motivate, teach you the proper forms and give you one on one help if you need it. The gym is surrounded by pictures and words that will motive and push you to strive to hit your desired goals. Not only will you learn about nutrition and fitness, but you will gain friendships with fellow workout peers and the trainers.< /Text>

United Fitness is a blessing, Family environment “Family” – No one gets left behind!! when I Started on my Journey, I was concerned I would not be able to do any of the workouts, that I would not catch on, I was doubting who I am, But knowing I CAN DO ALL THINGS, Through my God who gives me strength, And giving it my ALL, I was able to workout, lose weight and Inches off my waist! The Trainers are Amazing in every aspect, the people friendly!  UNITED FITNESS ,taught me Good Nutrition, how to eat and keep pushing and reaching for that goal, and Never, Never QUIT OR GIVE UP!! Quitters never Win and Winners never Quit!!  I look forward to working out everyday, this program is a Life / Body changer because REAL change in your body comes when you get to your ‘limit’ and push a little further, and deciding in your mind to keep going is what it takes to see improvement  ,  makes me feel  strong and kicks my butt all at the same time! But Awesome!!   LOVE IT AND ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO CHECK OUT THIS PLACE #1 Work out facility!!!!United Fitness – LA Habra, ca. :)</review>

This is the only gym I've been to where I saw results and continue to see results while working out and sticking to their meal plans. The trainers/motivators are all friendly, and they are there to help whenever you have questions.  The environment is pleasant to be around.  You feel like a family, because everyone there wants you to succeed, is positive, and encouraging.  I've been there for almost 4months, and I'm still losing weight.  Joining UF has definitely been a game changer in my life.<//text>

The day before I was planning to start my first workout I came down with some health issues that prevented me from working out.  With my food already prepped for the week I decided to continue with the food plan which I received from United Fitness and delayed my workouts until the doctor cleared me to begin.  The support I've received from staff and the members of UF has been amazing.  Devin calls, gives minor exercise pointers and follows my weight loss through social media which shows he really cares about the members of this gym.  The members share recipes to make the food plan enjoyable.  Now that I'm preparing to start the workout process I'm already ahead of the game.  I've lost 12 lbs.  I'm excited to begin this healthy life and challenge myself to lose an additional 20 lbs in 6 weeks.  June 1st is my first day to workout and I cant wait.  United Fitness is more than a place to workout, its a place to meet new friends and have fun while going through the process of meeting our goals together.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dd2aaedd71d693:0xd01d2ac04cb50de<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I absolutely am in love with United Fitness' exercise program and diet. I call United Fitness "Curves on Steroids." I've tried everything I could to lose weight in the past (juices, hard-core training, cleanses) and this is the first program that has worked for me. There are so many advantages to this program besides weight loss...who knew that in addition to feeling better I'd make a new set of friends too. That's what happens when determined people band together...they support one another as family through the process. That, in addition, to a phenomenal motivation staff (trainers)..exercise has never been as thorough or as fun. I should know as two-time NCAA collegiate champ.</text>< pics>

< Review>
I just finished my 6 week challenger this past weekend. I lost 31 pounds, 6 inches off my waist and 5% BMI! United Fitness staff and the program helped me and encouraged me to stay on track to meet my goals. The nutrition plan is not hard as you have may great choices of meals and food selection. They don't "starve" you, but after 6 weeks, I learned how to eat healthy and still enjoy good food. I really love the class setting of the workout as all the people that go to the gym are super friendly and helpful as well! My recommendation is to do the challenge or at least come in and speak with the staff at United Fitness. I was really convinced in getting my health back and not carry extra weight around anymore. Sure glad I did, as I am able to fit into clothes that were too small for me before the challenge. My wardrobe seems new to me again! Just think, you can do it! United Fitness staff and my new friends I met, THANK YOU so much for each and every one of you! I am continuing with the program because it works. So, see you all soon at the gym!!!!!!< /Review>

Best decision of my life. I joined the 6 week challenge. During that 6 weeks, I learned a lot about nutrition and maintaining an active lifestyle. I lost 21 lbs during my 6 weeks and gained confidence, and new friends. The trainers here are very positive and knowledgeable, if you have an questions about anything they are more than willing to help you with anything. This place is more than a typical gym, it's my 2nd home.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>This place is INCREDIBLE! I didn't know too much about exercise and health before I came here and six weeks later, I have a amazing grasp on how to take ownership of my health and respect my body. The community here is like none other. I considered going to other gyms (24hr Fitness, UFC, Gold's, etc.) but I didn't want a gym, I wanted a place where I could grow and learn and this place was exactly that. The classes are fun, upbeat, and everyone is VERY friendly. The trainers are approachable, hilarious, and encouraging, they truly are there to help you along the way. I think the number one thing that I think about concerning this gym is that there is NO JUDGEMENT. The owner and the trainers and most concerned with helping you reach your goals wherever those are set and then helping you push a little far to discover your personal best. And you can't beat their 6-week weight loss challenge. It is an easy to follow plan that teaches you about proper nutrition, exercise form, and gets you jump started to getting in shape. I signed up for it and I was shocked at my results. 6-weeks later I was 27.2lbs lighter and I had shed 7% body fat. But more importantly, I was given the knowledge to continue exercise and now I'm training for half marathons! There is literally nothing bad I can say about this place. Just walk in and talk to anyone there, you won't regret it!</Review>< user_name>

I started this 6 week weight loss challenge to help me kick-start my weight loss goals.  So far I've lost 3 lbs in a week and I'm really enjoying the boot-camp workouts, they are challenging and exhausting.  I also like knowing what I am going to do the night before I workout so that I'm not coming into class clueless as to what is expected.

Everyone that works at United Fitness are awesome and encouraging and I've met a couple new people that are part of the challenge as well and they are super nice.

I know that all this hard work will pay off in the long run, making me stronger and fitter.  I will post my results after my challenge is completed.

While scrolling though facebook one day I came across a post which stated I could lose 20 pounds for free. Usually one would assume when seeing this that this is some kind of scam or there has to be a catch. Since the gym was right down the street from me I thought why not just send an email and see what happens. I was contacted pretty shortly after and asked if I could come in for a consultation.

Upon arriving to the gym I was greeted and the first thing I noticed how spacious and new everything was. The gym also had some of my favorite work out items such as sleds, kettle bells and free weights. I was informed a deposit was required to motivate people. It made sense to me. I could see people giving up after a week but if you had money on the line people would be inclined to really give it their all.

At first I though the deposit was a bit steep and I compared it to my big box gym where I paid 30 a month. I decided nothing ventured nothing gained so I signed up.

During the first work out I realized how much trouble I was in. I have been working out for years now but this was a different ball game. I usually take my time and lift heavy 3 to 5 times a week but I was not prepared for this.The workouts are set up in a boot camp style. The trainers come up with the workout of the day and mixes cardio with lifting. I then realized how out of shape I truly was. The trainers were great and motivated me all though the workout. I thought I was never going to make it but I kept at it and stuck to the meal plan.

As time went on the pounds dropped and the workouts became easier to me. I am to a point now where I can do back to back workouts. The workouts themselves never get easier you just get better. During my first 6 weeks I dropped 30 pounds. The before and after pictures were pretty astonishing. It's really hard to see yourself as you truly are until someone from the outside holds up a mirror.

After crushing the challenge I decided to stay on with United Fitness. I knew I could not do these type of workouts on my own. Each workout is unique and challenging. After 5 months I have lost a grand total of 61 pounds. While I still have a ways to go I know with the support of United Fitness I will reach my goal of 100 in a year.<//review>

I joined united fitness to become more fit and truthfully, to do at least one pull up! I've been a member for one month and already i am lifting weights I never thought I would be able to do! The workouts are approximately 30 minutes long, with awesome hours of operation! The bootcamps fun and fulfilling and everyone there treats you like family! The motivators/trainers are awesome and are always willing to help with not only workout techniques but also nutrition,! UF is a great fit for anyone and if I could do it, why not you! ﻿< /text>

<review>I know this may be very difficult to believe, but I have not always been as good looking as Ryan Gosling! Since I started at United Fitness, I have attended more classes than I did English classes in high school. The trainers are awesome, they always keep me motivated and the music is awesome....especially the remix to "ain't nobody got time for that"....classic! Everyday is different, fun and exciting....except Burpees, oh how I hate you! My fitness goal is still in the works, but the 6 week challenge was the best way to get me off my butt and get me started on a path of good choices, that I hope I can stay on for years to come. The only downside I have found to this gym is that thanks to United Fitness everything in my closet is huge on me and I hate shopping. Anyway, United Fitness is awesome and always keeps it classy! Good day!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Joining United Fitness was the best decision I ever made! I was finally at a point where I felt like I was in the right frame of mind to finally committing myself to getting fit & healthy. After speaking with Devin during my consultation, I knew this was the right place for me. The people at UF (both trainers and members) are the most genuine, kind people I have ever met. Each and every one of them encourage you and motivate you to your fullest potential. We're are like family, and that's something you need when you're on as difficult a journey as losing weight. Being a member at UF has changed my life for the better and I couldn't be more grateful. They give you the tools you need to really succeed! I would most definitely recommend United Fitness to anyone and everyone looking to improve their health & lifestyle!</Review>

<text>I started my journey with United Fitness Feburary 2, 2015.  Although I did not reach my goal of losing 4% body fat I did lose 11 lbs and 3% body fat.  I am 61 years young and because of United Fitness I feel 30 (most days).  I recently had a visit with my sister who I had not seen since Christmas and she said "I haven't seen you look like this since highschool" .  Best compliment I have had in years.  Thanks to the best team of fitness mentors and motivators.  I am truly hooked on United Fitness.  If you decide to take your health and fitness back this is the best team to lead you.  You will only have suscess with the United Fitness Team.<//text>< pictures>

<text>So due to my work situation, I had to cancel my membership and Mr. Devin told us he has to charge us for 1 more month. When I told him why, he told me that I signed on this in my contact. I know I should have read every single line but I thought I'm dealing with a company that's just trying to collect money for no reason. I'll get my money through my bank.

Make sure you read what you sign on. They are just trying to get money and he will just point to your signature.

Update on 4/1/2016: This month they charged my account again. I will talk with my attorney</text>< Pictures>

The only reason its short a star is because I personally needed more availability from the gym .. if i missed the morning workout then I couldnt hit the gym until the next day. Other than that I totally reccomend this gym :D !!!< /text>< gmapID>

I ended up coming back to the gym 3 months later and couldn't be happier!! I kick myself all the time for leaving in the first place! I woke up and realized I won't change without the support and that is truly what I get at this place. I needed this to open my eyes to the unhealthy lifestyle I was living. I am so glad to be back!!

<Review>I saw the ad on Facebook to loose 20 lbs in 6weeks. I've been telling myself I need to lose this weight for so long. So I thought this is the push I need. I called United Fitness to join the challenge and haven't looked back. In fact, I love it here! The trainers are top notch and very positive motivators. I recently moved from LaHabra to Glendale and now I drive an hour each way to come here. Why? Because you can not get these results in any regular gym. Period. For men or women. Plus, its a no brainer. I don't have to plan my workouts (and yes we all think we know the moves) but the truth is you can't train yourself and adjust your technique as you go, and keep yourself motivated to where the sweat is pouring. I guarantee if you think you know every move in the gym, come here, these guys will surprise you. Not only that but they encourage you the whole time.
Last thing I have to add is that they teach you to meal prep one day for your whole week and THAT has been my lightbulb moment here. Everyday I have food to eat and don't have to think about it. It makes this whole process so easy!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dd2aaedd71d693:0xd01d2ac04cb50de< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
Extremely expensive and my lunch was a joke. The lemon soup bowl was the size of a child's little bowl. Not creamy at all. Very watery and had oil in it, maybe two tablespoons of rice and a few pieces of chicken. Very disappointed. The pita bread was awful, and the kalamative dip was just a bunch of cut up olives. There were 6 of us and only one of us had a decent lunch. Very disappointing for 5 of us. Never will eat there again. YUK!!!!</Review>

First, the noise. This is like eating in an auditorium. It was so loud it was near impossible to talk across the table. Next, the service. Somewhat disorganized, the waitress brought out the wrong wine but was pleasant and returned it for the correct one. Now the food, just average. We've eaten at other Opa! restaurants and have never been disappointed. However this meal was not the same quality as the other restaurants. And if you plan to order a glass of wine, don't be surprised when it arrives and it's almost 6 ounces, but hey, what do you expect for $18.00 a glass!!!!  The glasses may be 10 or 12 ounces and you can see from the picture they're not even close to half full.< /Review>

In the summer of 2020 Opa Morgan Hill was amazing. Great food, great staff and great service. My daughter and I dined there multiple times. But something has changed. The last three visits have not been good. It’s taken 45+ minutes to get our food. I’ve seen people get up and walk away because no server came to their table. Tonight our order was actually given to someone else and we had to wait an additional 20 minutes. I hope they fix this. The location and food are both very good. But I can’t spend 2 hours each time when the restaurant isn’t even full.<//review>

<review>More like Oy Vey! Our experience was terrible I really dont like complaining but.... From the moment we were seated until the end. Arrived, was seated right away, but then nothing from anyone for 15 minutes then a waitress comes asks if we've been helped. Then say ok then leaves. Another 5 minutes go by she comes back with silverware settings and asks what wed like to drink. I had to ask about menus then she says to scan some thing on the table with our phones. Maybe that new covid protocol I'm not sure we haven't been out much since the shut down. But we didnt bring our phones, as we like to spend quality time with our family. Well finally someone brings us the menus...  the another 15 minutes go by before she takes our order. Mind you the Male waiter has been serving people at surrounding tables who have come in after us. We order food and 2 beers.... 10 minutes go by and we get warm beers that were sitting at the bar waiting for us. I saw them from our table. Then our "food" arives... on the menu it was called one of Greeks favorite dishes. So I thought I'd try it. Lol left over hamburgerhelper was served to me and it was cold. I imagine it too was sitting waiting. My husband order salmon it was over cooked and burnt at the bottom. The manager did compensate one of the meals which we told her she didnt have to. So that was nice since I didnt eat it really. I was so hungry.

Oh well can't win them all. Hopefully others experience better service there. But as for me and my family. No thank you. Should of went to taco bell haha< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>The food was great. We got a table outside right next to the fire pit. The only downside to our experience was the long wait time for our food. We ordered dessert and waited 15 minutes for them to come out and tell us they didn’t have anymore. Other than the long wait times and poor communication with staff, the food was excellent.</Review>< GmapID>

My date and I would have been comfortable in the most awkward place setting, although we were not seated in a hi-trafficked location.

< Review>
The lamb skewers were not tender, had a ton of fat on it & was a bit on the gamy side, per the hubby. The pita had good flavor but the lamb was cut too big. This would not have been too much of an issue if the meat was tender. I ended up slicing my meal, pita & all, since I couldn't bite into it without the meat getting pulled out. Overall the lamb had good flavor, probably due to the fat.

The chicken skewer was ok. My son only ate half of it so hubby took over. He said it tasted ok. We all ordered fries & that seemed to be everyone's favorite part of the meal.< /Review>

<review>Gyro nachos were pretty good, but the beef skewers with fries took the. Also got the burger and gyro pita, it was fine.

We had a big party, I thought service was pretty good. Sat in the corner by the bar, the bartender double as our server. She was very tentative while doing double duty, excellent.<//review>< Pictures>

Guys who work with grill are the best. My husband had lamb souvlaki, I had grilled sea bass. And servise was very good too. But persons who's responsible for a side dishes don't do their jod very well. My husband french frys was absolutely dry and testless, mine spinach was too salted and potato weges were not fully cooked.</review>

Fantastic service, very helpful and mindful of being friendly through the masks. They do ask you to order from their online menu to increase touchless practices — very much appreciated!
The spacing is slightly narrow as the tables ARE socially distant but there's too many people walking through
The food as mentioned by others is slightly too salty for my taste.
Bathrooms are kept clean.

Un posto carino con personale gentile ed accogliente!  I gyro sono leggermente troppo salati per i miei gusti.<//review>

<text>The place is very nice but quite echo-y. It could use a soft touch to balance out the textures and hardness of the tall windows and walls. I can imagine how nice the place will look with some plants decorating it.
Food was great, although the kitchen was a bit slow this particular night. Drinks were average; I would not consider this a destination for getting craft cocktails.</text>< Pics>

The food is sinfully delicious, our waitress was very helpful in helping my date select her entree. Really on the ball. I can't say enough good things about her and the food. Very nice decor. Only thing is it was a little too pricey. Two drinks and two lunches 1appetizer was $106 dollars before the tip<//review>

The food was really good and came out very fast. The drink service was slow we got our appetizer 5 minutes before our beers which were only slightly cool. The calamari was great and so was the lemon prawn tower. The topping for the flank steak was bland and we scraped it off. The steak it's self was good and cooked to order. I will definitely be back lots of good looking stuff on the menu.< /Review>

Excellent place for an outside.mealmon a sunny day. Located in Morgan Hill, you feel right at home with the great service and warm reception at the door. The menu is full of great food, and the list of cocktails is tempting. We had the oven roasted chicken and vegetarian skewers, both were amazing with flavor, spices, and portions. Service is a major plus at this spot, and scenery is exceptional on a warm day.</Review>

Couldn't wait for Opa to open in Morgan Hill, Cali. The place is aesthetically pleasing and have larger areas to dine including booths for six. In addition,  the food is amazing. Outside dining is great as there is shade and cool air. The drinks are reasonably priced and the servers are attentive and respectful. So many great places to dine in downtown Morgan Hill, ca<//Text>

Food was good. Great location and ambiance. We had the village salad and the pita platter. Good choices if sharing. The wait staff however need more training. The batender and bus boy helped us more than our assigned waitress. The wait staff were more interested in talking to each other and not the customers waiting to order or close out their bills.

The tzatziki sauce that comes with the dish is surprisingly good, coming from someone who doesnt even like cucumber.
Excellent wait staff, water and drinks were always filled.
Would definitely go again!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Food was ok. My husbands flank steak was very small and over cooked,  my fish was ok.  The vegetables with my fish were  just ok. A little under cooked for us.  The worse thing though was our waiter. He was so busy talking to "flirting with" the GIRLS  up front that we felt ignored.   After waiting awhile for our waitet I had to ask another young man to find something out for me and to let our waiter know i wanted  a baklava sundae and the check.
The sundae cost $10.50, just the baklava was $8.50. That is One TINY scoop of ice cream for $2.  The big glob is whipped topping.
Most likely  this was our first and last visit there.<//review>

But come earlier if you want to see people walking the streets, by 9pm there is only Opa and a few other places open, but the places that stay open later are pretty good., I wish they downtown would say open a little later like 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays.</text>< Pics>

The one good thing I can say about "upgrades" to downtown Morgan Hill is that we have been blessed by an improved selection dinning choices and Opa is one that heads the list.
- We've always had a great meal here. We tend to make it to Opa's for an early dinner so we slot-in easily between the official Lunch/Dinner crowds giving us  our choice of table (hence I can't say from experience how peak hour dinning there is but I'd think it is packed so I expect reservations would be wise). Just writing this review now has my salitory glands kicking into action anticipating my next meal there even though I'm presently 3,000 miles away!
- If you like great Greek food that can satisfy either a meat/veggie lover's appetite, set your sights on making a visit to Opa soon - just don't steal our timeslot!</review>

<Review>Food was very good.  Service was good though a little disorganized.  Ambiance is good except it is very noisy.  We had Chicken Souvlaki with Opa! fries and cauliflower gratin plus Lamb Pita with small Greek side salad.  Chicken was good, fries were almost too crispy to eat.  Lamb was well prepared and tasty.  Pita was fresh but very bland.  Greek salad was good with nice balance of ingredients.  Sangria (red) was good.  Prices are a little high but not extraordinarily so.  We will return to sample other items on the menu.</Review>< Pics>

GREAT ... restaurants are more than just amazing food, like any other business it's people are the best part of the company. Opa is no exception, today I went back in after not having been there for nearly 6 months.

I'd left my credit card there, and called the same day and asked if it was there, which they confirmed they did have and would hold for me.

fast forward 6 months later (my bad), i gave my ID to the hostess who came back a few minutes later with my credit card :)

as i was gathering myself, joyful my card was back in my wallet, the owner came up and told me he was glad he could be of service.

pretty cool, and i'd say the whole tone of the restaurant is like that.

i thanked him very much, and he explained how he managed lost card, which was amazingly thoughtful and respectful to other clients like myself who accidentally left their card there, very cool.

i appreciate it, you're a stand up business, i wish you well, jeff<//review>

<Text>The atmosphere is light hearted, and active. We didn't have to wait long for the food or the drinks, and the staff were incredibly courteous. They did not interrupt needlessly, but were available for drink refills and requests if necessary.
I had the Horiatiki salad, and although it was a bit too acidic, the bread balanced it out nicely. I do wish there was more cucumber in it and less tomato, just to add a little more color and get rid of some of the acidity. My dinner companions both enjoyed their meal, one of lamb souvlaki, and the other the Opa! Saute. If I were to change my order, I would have gotten the saute as it looked fabulous.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I've been coming to NoCal a lot this year as I'm really relating back to my San Francisco hometown roots.

After my cousin picked me up at San Jose Airport we're both hungry and settled on Morgan Hill for lunch. Wanting to go to Willard Hicks we settled on Opa as WH was closed.

Opa is an attractive restaurant. The outdoor seating area is lovely, the indoor bar is complete and the staff is incredibly nice. The Greek menu has all of the regulars along with their own take on certain dishes. I loved their Greek themed Beet Salad. It had all of the components of true Greek flavors. Where they do miss my excellence bar is the flavor of their "Proteins"? My chicken in my Pita sandwich was missing flavor and it was dry. If I just ordered to the above salad, this review would have one more star.

As it was, good is good. And in the Yelp World, good = 3 Stars.</text>

Food: average to okay. Service: average to bad. Took 10 minutes to get a table even though 6 tables were empty and unreserved. Host girl at the front is also tasked with taking phone orders. Service was bleak and got worse over time. One of our glasses had lipstick on it so we asked for a new one, server took it and came back with a new but didn't say a word. Disappointed...<//review>

<text>I love Greek food and I love Opa in Los Gates. We ordered the saganaki first. It was under cooked or I should say under flamed. Cheese was probably frozen. Both my son and I ordered the gyro. Meat was dry and the opa fries were cold and tasted like cardboard. Not to mention no flavor. We won’t be back again. I don’t know if it was because of the management in Morgan Hill or if Opa has gone down hill.<//text><Name>Sandy Dal Santo< /Name><GmapID>0x808e212f6aaa2b79:0xcc5fc56583d368b3</GmapID><user_id>116440672022277991010< /user_id><Response>None<//Response></record>

Don't bother eating here..what s.major disappointment after how long they took to open. It's unbearably loud, the ambiance and acoustics are horrible. The food is not good...bland, and overpriced..basically like a Greek attempt but more like CPK. I  will never eat here again. Go to Ladera or Mama Mia's or one of the other many fine establishments that are actual ambiance and quality..this place is a mcmansion of dining... gross and inauthentic< /Review>

Food was alright, service was terrible. They were not very busy, with a few people inside and a few outside. Took about 20 minutes before we asked a passing server for some drinks and to find out who our server was. Another 15 minutes pass before we are able to order. Food was brought out for the two people I was with , mine came out about 10 minutes later. Had to find server for check to pay and leave.<//text>

Awesome place to do amateur astronomy late at night.   Gate in closes at 8pm, but you can leave whenever. If you are night hikers or whatever, and you see us there in the West contact station parking lot, please dim or turn off your lights, you're welcome to visit us in the dark but with your lights on you can't see through our telescopes.  National park fees or passes required.</text>

5 stars because it looked very cool from outside, but it is CLOSED! Not sure when it will be reopen, but it was closed on 5/2. We ran into a ranger and he was very friendly. It appeared they sold a lot of souvenirs and had a lot of information inside. Wish it was open!</text>

Visitors Center was clean and very informative.  Even though the park was limited access because of government shutdowns the Rangers had Junior Rangers packets available and park maps.  The displays were also very informative and interesting.  My kids liked the physical rock samples.  Great place to visit.<//review>

This is your starting point from the West entry to the park. Check in. Remember during the summer to bring water. This park can be hot and very unforgiving. Beautiful views everywhere. Drive to the Chaparral Trailhead Parking area. Enjoy.<//Review>

<Text>We were heading North on 101 and had a few hours to spare, so we made an unplanned stop here.  First off, the cave and the views were beautiful and we were really happy we stopped.  Reminded me of the Black Hills of South Dakota.  Except with Condors.
However, on October 11, the visitor center was closed and the park was not staffed, although the roads, trails, and bathrooms were open. Also, there is no mobile phone service there. So if you were (like me) too dumb to download the park map ahead of time, you are on you own.  I took a picture of the map posted at the West trail head, and we were then able to find our way into and out of the Balconies cave and cliff trails.
My advice is fire up your phone before you leave Soledad, and download the park map and maybe a Google map of the area too.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBlAU8LVszDzya3RttcmymjaZFyRu6UlDlNoXr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809243b644eda78f:0x3c7ce0591d514f6e< /gmap_id></record>

Simply breathtaking. Get there on a weekday at 430pm and you won’t encounter a soul. Experience the newly opened prewitt loop that overlooks a former homestead with views of massive rock formations. Super hot and dry so bring plenty of water. Took about
40 mins to do the loop.<//Review>

you CAN park at the trailhead & all the trails are open BUT the caves are closed with Gates and locks... otherwise everything is normal< /review>< Pictures>

Had a fantastic hike true some beautiful wildflowers.  The hike took us through a cave that required some maneuvering to get through but was fun.  The only drawback was The visitor Center was closed. We had planned to buy a senior discount lifetime pass for $80 when we got there but because the office was closed we had to pay a single day ($30) pass.  Not complaining. Just letting you know if your intent was to buy manual for a senior pass.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>. The park features unusual talus caves that house at least 13 species of bats. Pinnacles is most often visited in spring or fall because of the intense heat during the summer. Park lands are prime habitat for prairie falcons, and are a release site for California Condors that have been hatched in captivity.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x809243b644eda78f:0x3c7ce0591d514f6e<//gmapID></record>

Ranger was helpful. If you want to see just the cave go as per directions plates. Ranger may ask you to go for a big round, which has very good views but not necessary. May be she says it because its easy entrance, but if you are without kids even the nearer entrance is doable.< /review>

I am an amateur astronomer and I like the parking lot at the end of the road  for easy parking and use of telescopes. The surrounding hills are not high. Light pollution data says that the spot is Bortle 1  (darkest night sky)  I would like to have the spot open for special purposes like astronomy open to the public.  There is about 5 to 7 moonless nights a month so it doesnt need to be open every night.  It is very hard to find bortle 1 spots open to the public . I urge Pinnacles to consider my suggestion.< /text>

Quaint little shop with information on the park. There are walking sticks, plushes, stamps, stickers, etc for sale. Lady at the front desk was nice, and she explained where my family and I could go to hike. There was also a map of California with fault lines, etc.<//Text>

We were not able to talk to anyone on recommendation on trails. There were big maps of the park posted but they were not in good details. On the positive side there are regular toilets and water for filling the water bottles. The trails and terrain on the west side were well worth a trip there. This is definitely a very nice park but underutilized.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809243b644eda78f:0x3c7ce0591d514f6e</GmapID></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This section of sand dunes is always great. I haven’t had any complaints/tickets with parking and the dunes are simply surreal. I usually just stop by here when I’m driving by, but I came out once to shoot a bit for short film. There’s something beautiful about the size of the dunes and patterns found there. I highly recommend seeing them.< /Review>< Pictures>

Although no one was manning the station the restrooms were clean and no trash was blowing around. It's off season for sand toys and only a few visiters.</Text>

<UserId.>114088178722679711432< /UserId.><review>It's nature and beautiful; that's always 5 stars.  If you've never experienced sand dunes and you're not going to hoping buggy, put on closed toed shoes, get past some of the human littering and hike up. It's not easy.  If you have kids,  let them climb up and slide or roll down.  The ranger station has pamphlets.  Enjoy!</review><time>1533655743782< /time></record>

I can't tell you I'm partial to dive bars, except for the fact that I am. They played some John Denver on the jukebox and then some Prince. My body didn't know what to do. Fortunately they have pinball machines so I figured something out. their pinball machines are in good working order and they also have a Golden Tee. As far as I'm concerned that makes a good dive bar. If you're into pool and steel tip darts they have those as well</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Worst experience I have ever had at any bar in my lifetime. The other reviews below this one are a lie. Do not believe the fake reviews and comments. Never been treated this way, do not recommend to anyone. Attending this bar would be your biggest mistake. I completely understand the dynamics of a Dive bar but this piece of work took the cake. Bar tender completely rude, horrible customer service, dirty, bad energy.
WOULD NEVER RECCOMEND
I'm a owner of multiple businesses, I know what customer service is. If the owners would like to contact me and have a meet up i'd be more than open to it.< /review>

< Review>
The Bar: Located in Orange, on Chapman Avenue across from the local high school. In a strip mall, with a Del Taco within walking distance which is especially nice when wasted. Approaching the bar, there is a single door into a dark room. The bar itself is oddly shaped, sorta like a boomerang. First thing ya notice walking in, is the liquor, conveniently placed near the door to attract the consumer.
The Crowd: Well, this night, it was pretty dead inside. We ran into another bartender from Marty's Cocktails out partying with her friends, so we decided to kick it at that end of the bar. As for the rest of the crowd... there were a couple of old dudes at the bar, and a couple on the pool tables.. that was about it.
Service: Prompt, but the bar was empty.
Prices: From what I can remember, I believe it was $2.75 a bottle for domestic, and $5.50 a shot for Jameson, yet no PBR.
Entertainment: 2 pool tables, bar top video game, dart board, a few TV's.
Restroom: I almost don't need to write about this disgusting area. Look at the picture below. It smelled worse that in looks, if that's even possible.
Bartender: Poison pusher for the night was Teri. From what we've heard, she is legen....wait for it....dary. Would not disagree with that statement. Made for a great time.
Closing statement: Besides being on a major street with lots of Cops, not too bad. Had a great time, with great people and certainly plan on making a return trip in the near future.</Review>

This is highly unlike me to visit once and review, but as a warning I will not be returning. I only went here because I couldn't find Blondies trying to grab a drink before an event in the area.

Cash only, ATM inside. Dingy sticky gummy carpet, dark from not having any windows. Poor lighting is probably a good thing so you don't see things you don't want to. 2 Beers on tap and a dozen in bottles. Strong makers and coke. Cheap bottle of Newcastle. The coke was poured from a bottle and not from a speed tap, that's pretty hood and the beers are the real value. The smell reminded me of those old dessert dive bar in Nevada way way way of the strip, a mixture of sweat and cleaner. The bar itself is shapped interesting.

A dozen stools around the bar and pool tables in the back. I didn't use the restroom because I had 2 drinks and bounced. They were folding bar towels as I came in. I was digging the internal stained glass hidden window thingy and the old school cash register. Service was a little slow, but nothing bad, just 1 bartender for a HH swing in a pretty empty bar. I was totally used to the Cumbia music blaring as well as the cheesy fluorescent writing on the black board. T-Mobile 4g service was good inside. Parking is limited up front and even more so on the sides and back.

Dive and nothing more. I prefer a dive with more variety to stand, sit, maybe a patio, some windows, better tv's, better music, but most importantly beer on tap. I'm not a bottle drinking and that coke from a 2 liter bottle was the straw for me.</Text>

<userid>107056353819308643377<//userid><Text>The only Jordanian cuisine restaurant in town serves plates to entire feasts in a large, white tablecloth dining room. A happy, talented family-run restaurant.  Authentic, perfectly made dishes include  both mezzo (appetizers and dips) and sumptuous meat dishes, including one served on a grill with just about every protein you can think of on it.  A memorable experience. Parking out back.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Middle Eastern food and service at this place is super good. Staff is always super even when they have a full house. The service here is outstanding. Food is like a place in Baltimore I loved.< /Text>

<Review>Ok if your reading this then you are looking at the new best kept secret in LA. Oasis Mediterranean cuisine has just opened on La Cienega. The owners are great people and the food is AMAZING!  From the fresh ingredients to the vibrant flavors, you will be satisfied with every bite. The menu has alot of options from appetizers to full entrees. (See photos)  And the desserts are to die for. Try the Baklava (see photo)  Come down and treat yourself to a great meal run by an amazing family. Oasis Mediterranean Cuisine thank you for the great experience, great meal and good old fashion hospitality.<//Review>< Pictures>

Daughter and Son-n-law had wedding reception here and it was amazing. Oasis Mediterranean restaurant truly made this life event unforgettably amazing for all of us. From the beautiful decor, outstanding food, accommodations and VIP service they provided, we couldn't have received better. The smoothest, low stress and best choice for a wedding you could ask for. Recommend any event to have here from, wedding, birthdays, graduation, baby showers, or even just a family get together. Thank you Oasis Mediterranean for making this a beautiful memory and we will be back soon.<//Review>

Supremely underrated Jordanian place that's been in this little nook of La Cienega for only a year and a half. This place has my favorite middle eastern cuisine in the city. In particular, the ingredients here feel very top notch, particularly the meat. The shawarma is super high end and seems to be made with care like ive never seen it before. Hummus is incredibly creamy and the hummus with meat dish is a delicacy appetizer that is addictive to eat. They also have top quality gyro, olives and lamb dishes that I've tried. Really legit flavors here. I'm always surprised there isn't a line out the door for this place. Honestly it rivals anything I've had at bavel and it's a quarter of the price< /Text>

I am so lucky to live so close to this neighborhood     favorite.  Delicious and fresh every single time ... hummus to die for and an amazing assortment of fresh salads with any platter. If you are really hungry treat yourself to the eggplant stuffed pita with a hard boiled egg.... your taste buds will thank you.  I always bring family here when visiting from out of town and hands down it's always a highlight!</text>

<Review>middle eastern food and service at this place is excellent. Got there about two, it was not packed. There was fast, efficient, and courteous service.

Amazing food! Very authentic. The hummus was extremely tastey, and the foul was perfect. Some of the best middle eastern food I've ever had here in the US. Tastes like home!<//Text>

<text>So I have lived in the neighborhood for over 15 years and I have never been to this spot. I take dance lessons across the street at the LA Bellydance Academy (which is awesome! Everyone should try it!)
Anyway, my instructor along with several other amazing dancers were performing at Oasis so I thought I would go to support them. They were amazing! Now, as for the restaurant... I can not believe I have never been to Oasis! The food is absolutely incredible! Every single person working made equal efforts at making sure all the guest were taken care of. The space is very clean (spotless bathroom). But what I really noticed was the attention to detail that the owners and staff have. Everything was so sparkly clean ( down to the salt and pepper shakers which no restaurant ever seems to clean)
I am so happy to find a new local spot where the guest are treated with the utmost respect and the food is so amazing! I am writing this review on a Sunday, and am a little sad because they are closed on sundays ( which I highly respect)  so I have to wait till Monday to go back. Seriously folks, I am a huge foodie and a major stickler for customer service. The Oasis delivers  superior food and service  in a super clean and friendly family style environment. ❤️🙏</text>< rating>

<review>This awesome little eatery tucked away into the corner could be easily missed while driving on La Cienega. By the first look of it, I did not notice much people eating at the restaurant but once we ordered the food and as it arrives after a little wait, it was all worth it.

We ordered Musakhan which is basically a baked half portion of chicken that comes on top of a pita bread. The chicken was baked to perfection while the seasoning was incredible.

The combination of the bread and chicken is a must try. It is served along with yoghurt which very well balances the dish. The price point is a little high for the portion served, however from what I heard from the owner is every dish is made to order.

I would love to taste more of their dishes and would definitely be back.<//review>< pictures>

A fav spot for tasty middle eastern food. Service is always nice even when they have a full house. Definitely worth a return trip. This place has a cool atmosphere. Mood here reminds me of Colorado Springs area.</review>

<text>Tasty roasted chicken was juicy with a charred skin. Garlic spread have a good kick to the inner meat. Pita bread and hummus and cucumber salad finished off the half chicken meal. Fairly quick when taking out.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
Went there for the first time today. Ordered the "lemon Chicken". The rice and the Lemon sauce were decent,but the chicken was very hard, elastic, and yucky. Tried 3 little pieces of the chicken and couldn't touch the rest of it. So I filled myself up with rice and lemon sauce. The water was a bit funny tasting too. More like tap water than fresh filtered drinking water. So I walked away quite disappointed. Too bad as they are near my house and I love middle eastern food.< /Review>

I work right by this place and eat there atleast once a week! Food is fresh and tastes delicious. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is interested in trying Mediterranean or any who loves Mediterranean! The staff inside is great and always have a smile and are always open to conversation while waiting for food! Best Mediterranean I have had</Text>

<text>This place takes you on a safari to an oasis by simply sitting on your table.
The food is amazingly delicious 😋 everything thing is superb from the appetizers menu to the dinner menu with the best Lebanese mezza you can possibly have.
Really love the way their kabob is served on mini charcoal barbecue grill that sits on your table beautifully adorned to keep your kabob warm
Come once to this place and you will be hooked for the rest of your life guarantee it 😉</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<name>Karen Kurokawa<//name><Time>1557552825866</Time><rate>5</rate><Review>This wonderful family-owned restaurant serves familiar Middle Eastern dishes but with a Jordanian touch that elevates them above their competitors.  They also have a few Jordanian specialty entrees every night from among those listed on the Twagen section of the menu.  Tonight's Bamiya (lamb shank with okra in a light tomato sauce was excellent.  Their slow baked, sophisticatedly seasoned chicken Musakhan is also worth seeking out. I order it with rice instead of pita because I have celiac disease.  Their tender, cardomom-scented rice definitely not a second-best! By the way, I am a ful mudammas fan, and there is no doubt that the ful at Oasis is the best I've eaten in Los Angeles.  It is served warm and mashed, topped with tahini sauce, good olive oil, chopped tomatoes, and a few spots of excellent house-made green hot sauce.  If you enjoy spicing up your food, you can ask for some extra hot sauce to go with it, though I think it is perfection just the way it arrives.  The service is warm and friendly, and if you have celiac disease and/or food intolerances, they will help to to eat safely and feel welcome.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I have come a couple of times and they have some of the best chicken I have ever had in my life. It's juicy and moist and when you come at night for dinner on some nights they have muskhan. A half of a chicken with mixed spices and baked in the oven.</Review>< Pics>

I like the food. But my first time trying this place turned me off coz of this old guy on a pink shirt sitting next to our table kept on farting loudly like he's in his own house.
No shame.</Review>

The ambiance is so charming and romantic! Fave dishes include the fatet batinjan (eggplant with pita croutons, my #1 fave dish), chicken artichoke pita, kafta, and ouzi (ground lamb and beef with rice). We found the foul mudammas a bit bland. Other worthy dishes are the lubieh bezait (green beans) and arnabeet (cauliflower).< /text>< Pictures>

I ordered food here online and waited 45 min. for someone to finally call and say that our order hadnt even been confirmed yet. They tried to get ahold of the location and couldnt, the only person they were able to get ahold of was an off duty manager that said he would try to figure it out. Then we tried calling the location ourselves but the number that is posted online is disconnected. Horrible experience.< /Text>

<Text>I'm glad they finally reopened. Best hard-shell tacos in town. Plus they served really good margaritas. You definitely got what you paid for. I also like it because it is decidedly a locals place, but they don't mind non-locals coming in. Bartender was first class conversationalist and a great mixer of drinks.</Text><Date>1594926105849<//Date><UserId.>102427698592771999087< /UserId.>< GmapID>

Chips and salsa were ok. It tasted like Pace and not homemade, though. No beef products were available when we went. So we ended up getting chicken and pork tacos; tacos could use a touch more salt and seasoning. Service, however, was good. Nice employees.< /review>

<Text>We stopped by on the way up to Tahoe and experienced slow service, poor food quality, and we felt discriminated against. Other tables received their entrees before we received two appetizers and it took about ten minutes to get the bill after requesting it. Chips and salsa took over twenty minutes to get to our table, and it wasn’t even packed! There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants in the area; please choose those before this one.<//Text>< pictures>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>The restaurant is older, but clean. Service was really good. Just wish the margaritas were too. Apparently they make big hugs of margaritas for their house margarita. It was not drinkable. All sweet and sour, I could not taste tequila at all. I even tried to water it down and still couldn't drink it. I let my server know and she took it off our bill. The owner came over and offered a freshly poured margarita, I thought I was getting one. I decided to pass. The food was ok. The salsa was not very hot.< /Review>< Rating>

My heart aches as fervently as my stomach does. Though you were covered in a high volume of red sauce I still will never forget nor forgive the darkest of secret which is beneath. As I say my hasty goodbyes I shall never forget you my carne Asada burito. You took away the trust I put in you and did not supply the joy that many other burritos have fulfilled. Thine boiled meat tasted as coyote wastes and thy rice hast scrubbed my bowels. Never will I darken the door of this dungeon of overpriced food< /review>

<review>When I come to Bishop and crave a good Mexican dinner, it's always La Casita! The chips and salsa are great basic starters. The restaurant makes their own salsa and offers two types: mild (for wimps) and hot. Tell 'em to bring the hot... and don't worry, they'll bring plenty more if needed. Their salsa is a sort of chunky style with diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro etc. Yum! Oh, and make sure to order a Modelo Especial (Cerveza) or two to enjoy with your appetizer and main course. The cheese and beef enchiladas are delicious, as are their many other menu options. Everything is fresh and tasty, you'll never leave hungry!

Despite reading some other reviews, I've always received top-notch service here, never had any problems. Their servers are always prompt and courteous! There's an adjacent bar next to the restaurant. If you're only looking for drinks and relaxation, maybe watch some sports games, you have that available here too.

When you're in Bishop, make plans to stop by La Casita for a delicious Mexican meal!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80be3dfe6539e537:0xc72a8fc4223868c2< /Gmap_id></record>

Food was just okay again. Meat in taquitos tasted like pressed canned food.  Sadly, not as good as they used to be. No longer my favorite place.< /Text>

Good margaritas but don't order the food. Seriously don't. Good place to hang out and get drunk but go elsewhere if you're hungry. They messed up huevos rancheros, which is usually very, VERY, hard to do.<//Review>

This food is maybe a step above Taco Bell, definitely not authentic. My favorite items were the chips (not the salsa) and my iced tea. I ordered a combination plate: rice, beans, chicken taco, & chile relleno. Aside from the rice & beans the rest kinda meshed all together with red sauce over it. My friend ordered a combo plate with an enchilada & tamale.... she had to ask the server which was which since it too was covered in sauce. I wouldn't recommend this place.</review>

The food was out quickly and they seated our large group easily, but the food was over-seasoned and dry. I ordered tamales and enchiladas and the tamales were so salty I couldn't finish.< /Review>

After my beauty supply store closed, I found Un’i by accident. I’m so pleased with this place. I’ve been using Satin Ultra hair color for years and they have it here. The owner Stella and staff are helpful and the prices are great.<//text>

<Review>Clean and well stocked for professionals.
This has products that need to be mixed.
Great selection of wigs and hairpieces. I always go in to buy trays of strip eyelashes!.< /Review>< pics>

They watch you shop and act like you are shop lifting. They made me feel so uncomfortable, I went in for a toner and I was also looking at the semi permanent hair colors. I have blonde hair and like to add purple dye to my shampoo. They come up to me immediately and ask me if I needed help. I politely said, "No thank you, I'm just here for a toner." She quickly responded this is not where the toners are. So irritating! I was being watched the whole time by this hispanic lady.< /Text>

Wish I could give no stars but I had to at least give 1 the owner of this business is very unprofessional if your going to have a business in a diverse community and are racist to the people who are giving you there money then you need to be closed down! I will never spend a penny in this store again mind you I'm a Licensed cosmetologist and have a bachelor degree in business so I know a thing or two about customer service I can take my money and receive the same discounts as this place but because of convenience I choose to come here never again! There merchandise is marked up so high above the margin and they refuse to give license professionals there discount unbelievable! She was rude and ignorant to the law I will be filing a complaint with BBB also the IRS tax administration on the price gouging and fraud charges on sample size merchandise that's being sold for profit also weight and measures for falsifying labels DONT SHOP HERE THEY ARE STEALING FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THEY Don't LIKE MINORITIES!< /text>

This place is the real deal. Steaks done right and service that is perfect but the atmosphere is something you DO NOT get outside of your own home. Quiet, music playing, perfect for our anniversary. Thank you for dinner.</review>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Absolutely hands down the best steak in the central valley. The staff is so pleasant. From the classic French onion soup and salad starter to the chocolate cake they will pack up for you if you are too full after you're entree. (I always choose filet mignon but theres lamb and salmon also) you will not be disappointed. Theres a full bar and excellent top shelf choices including a wine cellar you can tour. The only downside is its decor is definitely old school steakhouse with burghandy and wood everywhere. But its esthetic fits. Besides you will be busy falling in love with the food.<//Review>< Rating>

Have eaten at the Dutch Frontier and have always felt it was a rewarding experience with excellent faire.  Our party had dinner there last night and very disappointed in their New stork Steaks.  In the past they were excellent, however the owners for some reason keep changing meat suppliers and when I learned the steaks were coming from Kansas City I was very leery, however decided to keep the reservation.
Our bill came to almost $700. and we were all very disappointed in the steaks.  We all ordered the New York Steaks and all at the table complained as the steaks were laced with the silver skin through the meat which is simply unchewable and wrecks an otherwise good meal.  I purchase prime steaks from all over the country and consider Kansas City New York steaks at the very entry level bottom of the prime food chain, in fact I refuse to ever order them again.
I can’t understand why the Dutch Ftontier is not ordering and serving the best, especially considering what they charge for their dinners.  Allen Brothers, Stockyards, and Pat LaFreida to name a few supply restaurant quality prime steaks to restaurants and they are all so much better than Kansas City Steaks.    I’d much rather pay more and get more!
The evening was nice, service was good, corkage fee rather pricey, and entree a big disappointment!
I won’t be back unless they change meat suppliers!<//text>

<Text>We just had our entire system replaced by Reliable AC Company after getting a number of quotes from various companies. They were upfront, honest, and very fair. Cole, our two installers, and everyone we've worked with thus far, has made buying a new A/C unit as painless as can be. I would recommend them to anyone in the area needing a new unit or assistance with an existing one. Everyone who we have had out to the house has been kind, caring, polite and extremely timely- very refreshing customer service!< /Text>< Date>

<Text>My washer leaked during the spin cycle, so I called RAS and asked to send someone over to have a look at it. They told me over the phone that most likely it was the drain hose. When Jack showed up he already knew what had to be done. The issue was fixed within a matter of minutes, and he also gave me a few tips on how to use and maintain a washer of this particular brand. I’m very impressed with how professional and amiable he was. I wish all the servicemen were like that. Will definitely call again. Five stars.</Text>< pics>

<review>I can't say enough about the team of Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air. From beginning to end the team was top notch; professional, courteous and friendly. The receptionist helped me with my scheduling and was fantastic! She was able to rearrange a few things to get me in earlier than initially expected. Then it was the solutions team. They were careful and patient with me as I asked a bunch of questions. They made sure to put up and down blockers to protect my floors, walls, furniture and clothing as the attic entrance was in my closet. Would I recommend them or have them do more work when needed! Heck yeah I would!</review><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_name>

Alex came out and diagnosed my oven. He was very thorough and honest. He walked me through the issues until I understood the problem and offered a reasonable rate for repair. I definitely recommend this company. The manager who responded to my questions before the appointment was also great. I had contacted several companies and their price and service were the best. The others were rude in their reply. Alex also wore a mask during the visit and called ahead of coming. They were timely and efficient. Thanks!</Text>

<Review>The one thing I can that the heating system and AC are definitely a must! Yesterday our system went out and it was a very cold 24 hours. We called Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air to ask for help based on their reviews. From all the individuals we contacted, they were the first ones to give a prompt response. David came out to service our unit. He was prompt and professional. This is the first time we've used this company, and I will definitely call him again and recommend him to my friends and family. David explained the work he performed and seemed genuinely happy to be able to help me out, and the best part was that he had all his equipment in the car which saved him a second trip or a trip to the store. I highly recommend them! l highly recommend you use them for any services you may need!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Five Star service from Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air. Had an issue with a stove in our building. They responded within 10 minutes and I had an appointment the next day. Quick with communication and response. Came in the time frame and called before arrival. John our technician was courteous and great. He checked thoroughly and serviced the stove. I highly recommend their services as I have dealt with other companies that you have to chase down to even make an appointment.</review>

I highly recommend Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air! I used them to fix the washer and dryer. They quickly made an appointment and accounted for my workdays. They are honest and up front with pricing, which was fair and reasonable. Very professional and courteous. I will definitely use them again if needed!</text>

Richard did a wonderful job of installing a heating system in our house. They managed to do it in a way that looks much nicer than any of the other options we were offered by other HVAC companies. Richard had an eye for aesthetics and function and the price was right. Hopefully, we don't have to use it. But I call them again if I have any appliances questions.</Text>

Great experience. Josh was here within 45 minutes of my initial call. He diagnosed the problem in minutes, changed the part. His expertise in his field and great customer service made the difference in this customer's mind. I would highly recommend this company. Their pricing for the call and parts was very reasonable compared to some other quotes. Great Job!</Text>

I contacted Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air. They replaced our heating system because we have a baby in the house and our system was 30 years old. Better to replace it now before it breaks down in the cold weather They followed all social distancing guidelines as required during this stage of the COVID things. They were professional, respectful, efficient. They always took the time to answer any questions I had. I made records. Their price was reasonable. Anyway, would recommend them to anyone<//Review>

Our 10-year-old refrigerator stopped cooling and we called Reliable Appliance Company. They were able to send someone out very quickly. Connor called before he arrived (on time!) and he fixed the problem in about an hour. We felt the price was very reasonable and the service was professional. Connor was courteous, knowledgeable, and polite. Thank you for your excellent service!< /Text>

Nate came out this morning within an hour of first contact, was competent, courteous, and caring, and helped educate us about our heating system. The repair charge was extremely reasonable. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! Excellent thoroughness and follow through. Highly recommended.< /text>

<Review>Very poor experience with this company. The tech no-showed our appointment window of 9-12. After 12, I called so see where they were as I understand they can get caught up on other jobs. The tech called and set a new time later in the afternoon. He then arrived an hour after that new appointment time (he was "in the warehouse", ie not with another customer).

The tech wanted to replace a part on my dishwasher that I knew was not broken. He wouldn't provide any detail on why the thought it was the seal, just: "its broken". It was a seal that retails for $40. He wanted to charge $350 (it would have been 30 minutes of labor). I declined  because the price was exorbitant and I knew it would not solve the problem (based on symptoms I described to him, and that he witnessed himself).

Additionally, this tech had HORRENDOUS body odor. It was difficult to get close enough to sign the receipt, and (not trying to be mean or exaggerate) I had to open up the doors and windows to remove the smell after he left. It was really bad!

I called the office a few days later to let them know about the experience; they took my info but never bothered to return the call.

I hate writing bad reviews, but this one was exceptional.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I can't say enough good things about Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air. Shane and the whole team are incredibly nice. They did a wonderful job on installing our new a/c, furnace and air cleaner. We decided to get several quotes and they were very competitive. We couldn't be happier with the process from start to finish. Great company and I highly recommend them.< /Text>

From the very beginning, it was a pleasure to work with Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air. Michael very carefully approached existing issues, our needs and even wishes. The team was prompt, professional, and detail oriented throughout the entire installation process. I am glad I found Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air for their services! This is a great company!

Cannot recommend Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air enough! They are very prompt, personable, and professional. I worked with Cole and it was very apparent that he is super knowledgeable and knew exactly how to fix my home radiator issue. Being a new homeowner, Cole gave me some tips on keeping up with our boiler system, which I thought was very cool. Thank you!</Review>

<Text>Contacted Mike from Reliable to seek assistance with a Bosch dishwasher that was giving error messages; specifically, it failed to drain or work properly. He answered all my questions and set up an appointment for the next day. Alex showed up exactly on time, correctly diagnosed the problem, and fixed the issue. He and his assistant were masked clean and professional. A few hours after their repair visit, my dishwasher is back to performing. Very pleased and would use them again.<//Text>< pictures>

Worst Experience Ever! After a technician came to my house and took a $160 deposit for a washing machine part, I never heard anything back.  After ten calls to the business I received a rude call back stating that the part was delayed.  It has been six months with multiple calls and promises to receive a call back and I have been treated rudely by the customer service team, even hung up on.  They refuse to do anything but promise a call back from a manager which I never receive.  I have had a leaking washing machine for six months, I'm out $160 and I have not had any resolution to this issue.  I don't typically leave reviews but this is literally the worst service I have ever received and I don't want others to have to experience this.< /Text>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>After I left a request, within minutes I received a response. А team of technicians was sent on the same day. It was clear that they had a great experience and were very professional. Richard identified the problem with my AC and luckily, he had a part that needed to be replaced, which allowed him to start replacing right away. Within minutes, my unit was working again. The price was very reasonable.

I will recommend this company to everyone.<//Review>< name>

<text>It's difficult to find reputable appliance repair for ovens. Normally you call a listed number and there's an answering service that puts you in contact with a technician. When I called Reliable, the manager answered the phone for scheduled a same-day appointment. The tech diagnosed the problem and had it up and running within the hour. Most other places I called couldn't send a guy within a week. Thank you!!<//text>< Pictures>

This place is a rip-off, my mother called this place to repair her dryer that stopped heating up, at no point during scheduling did they ask if the dryer was GAS or that they don't repair gas part issues.
Upon arrival the repair guy checked the unit and told her it was a gas valve and that they don't work on gas valves. She called out a plumber to check the gas lines and shut off valves which were in all working order and he referenced her back to an appliance repair company.

Once she told me about what all had happened I called this place for more information on their diagnosis(failed part, pressure tests or something that would pin point the failure) the guy on the phone was not very helpful and said "if that's what my Technician said is the problem and we don't do it, then that's it" and "if I really wanted to know about the issue I should have been there".

If you want to pay some one to come out, just give you their opinion and not actually check any parts for failure then this is the place.<//review>

<text>Couldn’t be more pleased with Reliable Appliance Service. I used them a few times both for my own home and rental properties. They do an exceptional job installing ACs and repairing all sorts of appliances. I have no complains whatsoever – each and every time it has been a lovely experience to use their services. They excel both in customer services and workmanship, and it’s easy to see why they have so many five star reviews. I’ve recommended RAS to my friends, and they’ve all been grateful for this recommendation. I’ll definitely continue giving them my business.<//text><Rating>5< /Rating><time>1599408527530</time>< user_name>

<Gmap_id>0x80d958372eeee009:0xa14f38ef7265f1a<//Gmap_id><Review>I utilized this service on Tuesday 2/16/2020. Technician was prompt to come out and take a look at our home hood system. He told he would need to contact the manufacturer and he would get back to us. Let me preface by saying he was quick to come in, quick to diagnose, super quick to collect payment but lacks the follow up and it’s been almost over a week since I received any  information about my hood system.

I’ve diligently followed up with the company speaking to multiple desk operators regarding a call back. The most commonly used line was “I’ll get this message to the technician right away and have him call you back, and if he can’t I will personally call you back.”

I tell you, 6 outgoing calls to this company throughout 3 days and yet to receive a call back. It gets frustrating, and when you confront the operators on why you have heard a response, they get short, snippy and rude. Today is day 5 (7 if we’re counting Saturday and Sunday), I’m curious to see how long it takes to at least receive a courtesy phone call from a technician informing me about my hood.

Highly recommend using other companies, because honestly I doubt for a second I will receive any type of apology or compensation for the lack of professionalism and lack of fulfillment on their end.

So now I cross my fingers and hope I get more than a “I’ll get back to you as soon as we hear something” for a $70 5-min diagnosis.< /Review><userid>104451160993163211153<//userid>< Response>

Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air saved us thousands of dollars.
Our air stopped working and we had our "regular" service company come out. Long story short they said we needed at minimum a $1,100 repair and a new condenser. I called Reliable Appliance, Heating and Air to compair the est, and Matt was so friendly and helpful I decided to have them come out and give us a second opinion. The tech was super professional and knew what he was doing, within moments he asked my husband a few questions and determined our unit had simply overheated. He gave it a once over, fired it back up and it's working perfectly.
Thankful is an understatement. 100% recommend!!!<//Review>

<Text>I needed to replace my air conditioning system in my condo. Neighbour recommended this company to me and I decided to give it a try. I also checked online and they had plenty of five star reviews. They called me back five minutes after I contacted them, and within three days I had the new AC unit installed. The price was reasonable, not more than I expected. I’m very impressed with the way they worked – so fast, so professional. Seamless job, I’m very happy with the outcome. Thank you guys fr making everything right. Will recommend you to everyone I know.</Text>< Rating>

<review>Well, usually I just learn my lesson and cross a company off my list if I'm not happy, but one thing I can't handle is being treated as though I'm ignorant.

The replacement transmission for a 20-year old Kenmore washer does not cost $1,200.  I'm not sure why the gentleman told me that, but it took two seconds to Google it after he left.  The quote said a replacement cost $200-$350.  So unless the labor was a cool $1,000, his statement wasn't true.

If he had just been straight with me and said something like, "Look, I could charge you several hundred dollars to fix these two problems, but if I were you, I'd buy a refurbished one for the same price," then I'd be recommending this place for it's honesty.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

If AC installs sound like a big hassle to you, I highly recommend to use the RAS repair company. These guys know how to deliver satisfaction. They gave me a reasonable quote and  made sure to finish the work within one day. I expected they would turn the house upside down brining the  equipment and installing the system, but this never happened. The team was very respectful of my home. Five stars, and I’d be glad to give more if I could.<//review>

I’ve had Reliable to service my HVAC and immediately signed up the annual maintenance program. These folks are extremely professional, and I was really impressed with the service. I’ve hired lots of companies before, and some of them were above average, but this team just nailed  it. Far superior to any service I had before. Not only they fixed the problem in the most efficient manner, but also explained the things I should check out on a regular basis. Five stars!</text>

Read the reviews to find a quality service. Wow! It was the real deal. Fast, clean, and effective in identifying the problem and fixing it. Mile wrestled our washing machine, which hadn't been moved in years. He was in and out in under one hour.Good work. Thank you, Mike and Reliable Appliance Service! Highly recommend!<//Review>

<review>After living in San Jose for twenty years we finally had an AC installed in our house. Reliable Appliance Service gave us a very reasonable quote. The salesman was very knowledgeable and pleasant to talk to. He clearly explained everything that had to be done. What I like the most is that the estimate included all work that needed to be done – no hidden cost. The installers were fantastic! Professional and very friendly. They cleaned up the mess, showed us everything they’d done and made sure we knew how to use the system. Five stars, highly recommended!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

First of all, let me start by saying that this is a world-class company for me. I used them twice. Reliable provided great service from the manager in the office to the techs. They did my heater servicing, and David came out yesterday and did an AC tune-up. We will definitely be using you from now on, and telling all of our family, and friends about High Altitude Heating and Air. Thank you!</Review>

<text>Five stars! Reliable Appliance Service Responded quickly to my request for a fridge repair. They were able to get all the parts without delays. The technician arrived wearing masks and gloves, and were extremely respectful and courteous. They repaired my old fridge although it’s been in poor state for quite a while and eventually I’ll have to replace it. Anyway, these guys definitely got me several more years out of my current unit. Fantastic job!</text>< user_name>

We would highly recommend Reliable. When our refrigerator developed a problem, they responded within hours. Joseph did an excellent job of diagnosing the issue and explaining our options, and the work was performed on time and for a very attractive price. It's great to have such an honest and reliable company in the neighborhood.<//Review>

<review>We had a broken heating system, and Alex was amazingly quick at finding the problem and then was able to return quickly thereafter with the part we needed to get it fixed. He was very COVID-safe, with a mask and shoe covers the whole time. Alex also took the time to answer our questions about the issue and explain everything clearly to help us identify the problem next time. Lovely guy and highly recommend!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80d958372eeee009:0xa14f38ef7265f1a</Gmap_id></record>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Reliable Appliance Services Inc. commits false advertising, engages in dishonest business practices, and targets BIPOC customers with adverse treatment because of their race/ethnicity.
1. Bait-and-switch $25 discount code promised to customers upon initial phone call, upon commencement of service, technician informs customer that discount is only applied to labor costs.
2. Oleg Borukhov is an unlicensed technician (no license found with State of California's CSLB or BHGS) who has advertised his appliance repair services online despite lacking a license. He is ill-prepared and lacks basic knowledge on how to repair a washer.
Firstly, he took no tools or made any motion to inspect the hardware or internal workings of the washing machine, despite us informing him that there is residual water held within the layer under the tub of the washing machine which has prevented the washing machine from functioning properly.
Secondly, Mr. Borukhov simply put the washing machine to a normal washing cycle. It should be noted that he put the washing machine to a hot and cold water cycle, and when questioned by us if there is a difference between putting the hot and cold water cycle on versus just the cold water cycle, he indicated that there was no difference. When we asked him why would he then put the hot and cold water cycle on, he refused to answer our question.
Thirdly, after about 10 minutes of viewing the washing machine, Mr. Borukhov told us that the problem is with "the computer inside" the washing machine. We asked Mr. Borukhov to explain the problem at hand, and what exactly the computer problem was. Mr. Borukhov could not say. I suggested to him- "Was it the computer chip? The chip-board? The control-board?". Mr. Borukhov stated that "yes, it is that!" We asked Mr. Borukhov to tell us what specific part(s) should be replaced, if there was a part(s) number or a machinery technical name. Mr. Borukhov refused, stating that it was not part of his service to do that.
Most alarmingly, we asked Mr. Borukhov if the residual water within the layer under the tub of the washing machine was normal, and that we believed this was the culprit behind the malfunction. Mr. Borukhov claimed to us that it was entirely normal for residual water to slosh around inside that inner tub layer, despite us informing him that this residual water was not present in our first 5 years of purchasing and using the washer, and that it was a recent development that coincided with the washer malfunctioning. Mr. Borukhov insisted that it was normal. A cursory research online showed that washing machines should not hold residual water such as ours have.
3.  Mr. Borukhov did not properly wear a face mask when he was present in our home. His mask did not properly cover his nose or mouth, as he had the mask only partially covering his facial orifices. This alarmed us because his noncompliance with public safety ordinance was a threat to our health, safety, and well-being. My mother is an immunocompromised senior citizen as well.
4. Mr. Borukhov behaved aggressively, rudely, and disrespectfully to us, as customers of Reliable Appliance Services Inc. He also threatened us verbally.  When my mother asked him questions, he told her to be quiet and not to interrupt him. When we asked him questions (as noted above), he refused to answer and did not respond. When we questioned him about why the $25 discount would not be applied, and when I was on the phone trying to speak to Peter York, the customer service agent at Reliable Appliance Services Inc., Mr. Borukhov threatened my mother menacingly that "you need to pay now" or else.< /Text>< Pics>

Called Reliable to service my air conditioning unit to resolve an inspectionissue the buyers had from selling my home. They were easy to get a hold of and to schedule a time for them to come out. The workers who showed up were on time and courteous. I asked if they could check the AC for any type of leak and the worker had no problem doing that. He was very thorough and spent a lot of time trying to find any type of leak. The price was reasonable and the work was awesome!<//Text>

Thanks Reliable Appliance Service for rescuing me when my AC was blowing warm air! I couldn’t face the heat wave without proper air conditioning – my house gets as hot as an oven! Thanks to this amazing service, the issue was resolved within one day. Not only they fixed the problem and brought the cool air back, but they also serviced my system and answered all our questions (and we had many!). Exceptional service and friendly attitude! If my Ac gives trouble again, I’ll use this company again without a doubt.</review>

They offered me some valuable advice on how to fix it a very minimal cost. No pressure for buying the most expensive parts. Great to know there are still honest and reliable technician around.

My fridge was not starting up, and I dreaded the thought of having to purchase a new one. Fortunately, I’ve found this company. The service technician was very knowledgeable, he inspected the control board and immediately found some burnt connections. The issue was fixed promptly, and now my fridge is perfectly functional. He also gave me a warranty and his phone number to contact him immediately just in case. Thank you so much!</review>

<text>Reliable Appliance Service’s guys were very helpful. They sent a technician to check out my oven the same day I called them. As it turned out it was only a broken wire, nothing serious. He quickly diagnosed the issue and replaced the wire. My oven is as good as new. He even wiped the cabinet so it looks presentable. Couldn’t expect a better service! Five stars!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

We just bought the house a few months back, and our HVAC started malfunctioning. When I called the repair company we used for servicing our unit, they told us to replace the whole system straight off. They didn’t even bother to send anyone. Needless to say, installing a new air conditioning system was the last thing I wanted to do. I mean, who would be happy to face such expense? I decided to call Reliable to get a second opinion. They scheduled my appointment the same day, and in a few hours a very capable and efficient repairman was checking out the AC, the duct work and all the vents. After diagnosing the issue he said it won’t take him long to fix it, and it didn’t. It was a much cheaper solution, and my gratitude has no limits! The system is working smoothly, the chills are back in the house, and we couldn’t be happier with the service. Thanks for being so professional and kind. Great company!< /Review>

<Text>When you hire a company to repair your AC or even service it, you have a right to expect efficiency and politeness. But what you often do not get  is your work done at a reasonable price. That really was a rather surprise since I so used to various service organizations ripping me off for everything they think I am worth. Dealing with RAS was a very refreshing experience. The serviceman came over, worked on  my unit, treated me respectfully  and then ultimately presented me with a  bill that was extremely reasonable and which I could actually say that I was happy to pay. I highly recommend this company.<//Text><response>None<//response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user>

<Text>I’m absolutely blown away by the service of this repair company - I’ve seen all these positive reviews before going with Reliable Appliance Service for my HVAC repair, but to be honest they far exceeded my expectations! They got me scheduled the same day and did the job promptly and efficiently. The serviceman, Jason was also very amiable and fun to talk to. It was a pleasant experience having him around. He was respectful to my home and very considerate. The price was reasonable, I have nothing to complain about. Will definitely use in the future!</Text>< resp>

Reliable Appliance Repair in Oakland was absolutely fantastic! They were able to come the same day I called to fix my washer and dryer. The repairman diagnosed the issues with both very quickly and fixed my washer immediately and made a next day follow up appointment for the dryer. He was was very knowledgeable and fast. I super liked the quality. The level of service was above and beyond my expectations. Highly recommended service.<//review>

Our fridge was acting up and Ethan came to the rescue! He was very knowledgeable and a pleasure to deal with. Such a pleasant surprise compared to other repair folks. Not only did he diagnose and fix the issue, he also gave lots of helpful advice to help us avoid the problem happening again, along with tips on how to care for our washer/dryer so that we don't encounter future problems with it. Great guy, great service!<//Text>

We are so lucky we found them. They were kind enough to schedule us right away the following day- all other companies either didn't answer the phone or were too busy. Tom came exactly on time.

The quality of the work is just outstanding.. they left the house spotless each day.... they wanted our input on all decisions. I just can't rave enough about these guys.

When I called Reliable, they asked all sorts of questions and assured me there was nothing to worry about. Everything I needed was only to change the filters that were restricting airflow.

I’m fairly new to the area and had to have our air conditioning system serviced. There was no one to recommend a good contractor, so I did an extensive research and decided to go with Reliable Appliance Service. I don’t regret it for a minute. They sent a service technician the very same day, and I had my AC inspected, cleaned and adjusted (it’s quite old, so some minor repairs are always needed). It’s running smoothly and efficiently. I’m very grateful for the service and will definitely use again. 5 stars!</text>

We recently bought a house and needed someone to inspect and service our furnace. Reliable Appliance Service came to the rescue the very same day – other companies were willing to schedule our appointment after weeks. Matthew arrived on time, did the job and explained every step of the process in simple terms. We also had compatibility issues with some additional equipment, so he came up with a helpful suggestion. He was amiable and well-informed, and we plan to continue to use this company’s services for out air-conditioning and heating needs.</review>

SCAM: For once I actually knew what the problem was with my appliance - the lid locking mechanism was faulty. I called and asked how much that would be to replace and they said it depends on a number of factors and if there are other problems; so I was more specific, "how much would it be if this lid lock was the only problem." He never gave a straight number. Technician arrives, confirms it's the lid lock device (shocker) and then tells me it's "$400 flat rate to replace all lid locks." Why didn't the dispatcher say there is a flat rate? He said it would take "20 minutes to replace." I got stuck with the $70 service call. Take your business elsewhere or prepare for jacked up outrageous prices, already found another repairman to fix it for $85!</text>

<text>Michael was the serviceman, he was on time and very knowledgeable. He explained everything he did to repair my refrigeratorin great detail. On top of that, he was very friendly and not annoyed by my dogs who were very curious about what he was doing. Excellent! I don't typically need an appliance repair but in the future when I do I will be calling Reliable, I even saved their number into my phone.< /text>< resp>

The customer service is top notch. All my questions were answered in simple terms, so I could understand what exactly went wrong with my dryer. The service technician arrived shortly after I made a call and the exact part that needed to be replaced. Not only he fixed the dryer and made sure it was working properly, but also made friends with my dog who was very interested in the process. I have no complains whatsoever, excellent service!</text>

Our washing machine was leaking so I called Reliable Appliance Service. The technician was great - he quickly diagnosed the problem. He also found another mechanical issue with the machine and repaired it. I appreciated his honesty and thoroughness. Would definitely call them again! I will recommend this company to all my friends!</Review>

This really is a very efficient service, with techs who know exactly what they are doing. In the case of my Ac, the shaft of the motor seemed to be jammed, and it was amazing how the technician had the motor out and the replacement back in  the unit in  the course  of one hour. Not only did he do the job so efficiently, but he also told me exactly what was wrong in a way that I could understand it. I’m very satisfied with his work. Will definitely use the Reliable company again.</review>

Need an over repair? It’s very simple. Call these guys and you’ll get the best possible service. I stopped bothering with other repair companies since I discovered these folks. They are professional, prompt, polite and trustworthy, what else do you need? I always get an honest response from them. 5 stars!< /text>

<text>As mentioned in other reviews, RAS  is lightning fast, has a top-notch work ethic and his prices are fantastic. Another company wanted me to wait weeks for a repair, Mike came out in less than 24 hours on a weekend and had fixed my fridge in less than an hour after looking at it, saving me a LOT of money that would have gone to a new appliance. | will recommend them to everyone and I now have them on my phone for all repairs!</text>< Pictures>

<review>When my fridge stopped working, I was desperate to find a good and reliable repair company to get it fixed as soon as possible. I’m so lucky I came upon Reliable. Their response was prompt and efficient. The people on the phone were very knowledgeable, they asked a few questions about my problem, diagnosed it based upon my words and pictures I sent them, and sent out a service tech to fix the issue. Everything was done in a few hours. None of my products got spoiled. This is what we call an excellent service! Thanks a lot, guys, for your understanding and professionalism! I’ll be hitting you up again if something breaks in the house!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>My air conditioner broke down so I called Reliable Appliance Service.  I was charged $500(with new customer discount) but my wife is pregnant so we paid it.  I later went online and researched how much the part was that was replaced. Most expensive one i saw was between $40 and $80.  So I started thinking why did I get charged $500 for 40 minutes of work 3 zip ties and a fairly inexpensive part?  Tried calling them the last 2 days with an answer that supervisor would be in touch.  Waiting patiently this never happened....  Today sept 5 2020 it is 110 degrees out and go to use the said fixed air conditioner it will not stay on.   So I call and get the same answer.  A supervisor will get ahold of you this evening or tomorrow.  Guess I really don't matter since they already have my money.  Super disappointed in the way this place operates.  If you decide to still do business with i sincerely hope everything works out for you

UPDATE!!!!
Actually in response to your response I called everyday for a week. When I finally got someone to call me back he said he would come that evening.  I texted him  and he never showed up.  That was a week ago.. and I have not recieved a single phone call since. I have included a picture of the text conversation however short and brief it was.  I would love to screenshot my entire call log to prove you have not once reached out since this conversationhappened.  And as far as you supplier goes there is no way you pay that much more for a product your employee told me you buy in bulk and is a common issue with many ac units.  Aka buy in bulk save money.  Anyways I still look forward to you coming out and repairing my ac since it wasn't done right the first time.  Thank you< /text>< pictures>

The young lady who orchestrated and scheduled my service was fantastic and incredibly helpful. The gentleman who did the service did the job. All I needed was a part and it screwed in (would have done it myself if I knew that was only problem). He was not friendly at all and was at my home probably less than 5 total minutes, so you'd think he could be pleasant. I got the feeling he didn't want to be there and i wasted his time. Well for replacing a fan over my stove for $170, i don't think that was a waste of time.  May not seem like a big deal but I know I'm held to being pleasant in my place of business, so I expect it when someone is allowed into my home. I gave 4 stars because the physical job and everything leading up to it was great. Will I ever use them again? Because of the service technician,  I really don't know.</Review>

<Review>My fridge broke yesterday and I called Reliable Appliance Service. They were recommended by my neighbours as one of the most reliable and trustworthy company in the city. Jeffry showed up in two hours and quickly diagnosed the issue. He explained to me what exactly happened (it was something about the fridge’s thermostat) and told me what he was going to do. Fast-forward half an hour, and my fridge is as good as new. It works perfectly well, and I’m very happy with the service. You nailed it, guys. Thanks a lot.< /Review>< Pictures>

RAS provided amazing prompt service. The technician showed up the same I called, identified the problem with my outdoor AC and took trouble to walk me through the issue and explain what could be the possible cause. I felt very comfortable since he was amiable and polite. Excellent service, everything you expect from a professional and experienced repairman. Highly recommended.< /Review>

I was very disappointed when my 1 year old AC stopped putting out cold air. After asking some question, these guys assured me there was nothing to worry about. In a few hours the service technician showed up and diagnosed the problem on the spot – it was the control wire. He ran a new line, and we were cool and comfortable within an hour and a half. The price was reasonable, too. Thank a lot for your excellent service and keep up the good work.</Review>

Such a wonderful service! The very polite and friendly operator could answer my questions and gave a couple of good advice. In two days the technician Andrew came and checked my AC. He was in the uniform, wore face mask, gloves and shoe covers. Fortunately, he also had a huge truck with a looooot of details and parts. Andrew found a capacitor and my AC became new in a minute. 5-star review.< /review>

<review>When you dishwasher goes down, it’s surprising how the dirty dishes can pile up in your sink, and then you have to turn on the hot water and soak them, and wash them by hand. I’m a working mother, and I really don’t have the time for this. I really couldn’t be at all at ease until I had the machine fixed, so I looked up Reliable. I had never used their service before, but I was in rather a desperate situation, and decided to give them a try, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how quick and efficient they were. This very experienced and courteous man came over, and repaired my dishwasher perfectly .It’s very pleasant when a company sends out a really experienced repair man over, rather than an amateur whose just learning the job.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I needed my AC’s freon refilled. Out of all the companies, I chose RAS based on all the five star ratings they’d got. From the first seconds of working with them, they were polite and professional. The service technician was sent the same day. I was pleased to see that he showed up neatly and uniformly dressed. Freon was refilled promptly, and he also checked out the system for leaks. I’m looking forward to working with this repair company on a few projects around my house. Thanks for your excellent service!<//text>

It was hard to make any recipe when I didn’t know what temperatures my oven was actually capable of. They sent out a very knowledgeable handyman who told me the issue was with the temperature sensor. I could make out he was very experienced - the issue was solved in less than twenty minutes. Thanks for the good service, it was my first time calling you, but I’m sure it’s not the last one!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

They quickly discovered the problem, ordered the part needed to fix it, and were done quickly and efficiently. They were thorough and took the time to explain all that they were doing. Attractive prices and wonderful to deal with. I highly recommend this company.<//Text>< Pics>

Our AC did not work, I called Reliable at 8:30 am on Sunday, and they fit me into the schedule, and their tech came at 12:30 am on Monday to fix my AC. Being in the service profession myself, I greatly appreciated the knowledge and honesty during the appointment. He gave me several options for how to go about fixing my AC and recommended the most practical and economical option. John took time answering all my questions and educated me about AC. I will put him in my speed dial for future appts, furnace and AC issues, etc.<//Review>< Pics>

I needed an Ac urgently fixed in my Airbnb property – the guests wouldn’t tolerate a hot house for the money they’ve pad. Reliable came to the rescue! Brad the repairman reached within one hour, identified the issue and fixed the system before my guests arrived. Fantastic service, these guys were really helpful and considerate. Thank you so much!< /Text>

Excellent service from the RAS company! Thanks a lot to the wonderful team of technicians who serviced my AC, refilled it with refrigerant and even gave me a great advice on where to place the thermostat. It seems it was exposed to direct sunlight and therefore showing the wrong temperature and putting unnecessary strain on the unit. Not sure how I could make such a mistake. Thank you so much, guys, I’ll definitely call  again!< /Text>

<Review>Mike is the most reliable and knowledgeable technician I've ever met. I usually dread calling companies about home issues but he made my experience great! We had an issue with our AC blowing hot air instead of cool air and our AC unit is on the roof, which requires a longer ladder than usual. The ladder he brought wasn't tall enough, BUT he is so smart and was able to manage a way to get to our roof with the ladder he had. Other technicians I called wouldn't even bother trying to access our roof, but Mike really pulled through and did an amazing job. I've got cold air in my home! I'm definitely calling him again for any future issues. Thank you!!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Jack diagnosed the problem with our A/C unit and he was very polite and professional and clear about the work needed. We decided to replace rather than repair the aging system and another repairman came out the next day to discuss the replacement options. He was likewise very clear and professional. The system was installed. Very quick response and great service. I’m thankful to Reliable Appliance Service!< /review>

Contacted Mike to seek assistance with a Bosch dishwasher that was giving error messages; specifically, it failed to drain or work properly. He answered all my questions and set up an appointment a mere 2 days later. Mike showed up exactly on time, correctly diagnosed the problem, and fixed the issue. He and his assistant were masked, clean, and professional. A few hours after their repair visit, and my dishwasher is back to performing. Very pleased and would use them again.<//text>

Reliable always delivers the best possible service whenever  my AC goes down. They are prompt, efficient, and knowledgeable, without a  doubt. More than that, they are polite, tidy, courteous and respectful of one’s space. They also wear protective masks as per the COVID protocol, and you can see that the company really cares for the clients’ safety. Thanks a lot!<//text>

<Review>I’m very happy with the service. My washer stopped working and their technician came the next morning to diagnose it. Unfortunately, nothing could be done with my old and trusty machine, it was nearing 20 years of age, after all. But he gave tons of advice and assisted in choosing a new one. I’m very happy with the new washer, and it was also heavily discounted. Thank you so much!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service!   i had a horrible experience with a different company that I had to use through my home warranty.  So when i contacted "Reliable", i knew that this was not covered through my home warranty but it was worth it.   The service was great, responsive, professional, clean, just a pleasure to work with.   I felt the costs was reasonable as well.   i will keep this contact and use them again if needed.   Ratings do mean something.</Text>

Buying a new furnace was not an option anymore. But freezing in winter is highly an option either. So I called Reliable Appliance Service to see what could be done. They sent out Matthew who turned out to be a great expert at repairing hopeless furnaces. He took a lot of trouble over mine, but eventually it started to show some signs of life. He kept working for more than three hours until it was totally operational. Outstanding job, far exceeded my expectations. I think I’ll be able to make it through the upcoming winter.

These guys are awesome. We have three air conditioning/ heater units for our home, and they are carefully checked each time the Reliable's people come out. They are prompt, courteous, and helpful. I am the sort of homeowner who likes to watch and ask questions and they never make me feel in the way or troublesome. James had a lot of very good info and taught me a couple of things I wasn't aware of about our systems. We are very happy with them and I highly recommend their service.</Review>

My daughter was planning a slumber party with some friends from her new school when our AC suddenly went down. There was no question of accommodating half a dozen young girls in such a hot house. My daughter was heartbroken, this party was extremely important to her. I couldn’t let her down. It was highly unlikely any repair company could help us out as it was already late in the day. I didn’t have much hope when I dialled Reliable Appliance Service’s number. Imagine my surprise when they scheduled my appointment in one and a half hours! The service tech, Michael, arrived promptly, determined the issue and changed a part or two. The AC was working! And my daughter couldn’t be happier! I’m eternally grateful to these guys for their excellent service.</Text>

I’ve been using this company on a regular basis, and the only thing I regret about is not writing this review earlier. They deserve every good word people say about them. Always on time, always equipped with tools and spare parts, always courteous and polite. I’ve been using them for over two years for my AC maintenance and occasional repairs. They never disappoints. Highly recommended!</Review>

I should have read the reviews before I called this repair service company.  I called them out 4 1/2 months ago, in October,  because my Dacor oven wouldn't come on.  It needed a new ignitor, which cost me $607 dollars and the tech from Reliable, repaired it. Unbeknownst to me, he connected the wires of the new oven ignitor with black electrical tape.  Really?? electrical tape in an oven, where it gets so hot!!  Now, 4 1/2 months later it quit working again, surprise! surprise!  I called Reliable again and the same tech,  came out again.  He spent not even 5 minutes diagnosing the problem.  He tried to turn on the oven, the little light by the oven turn on knob, didn't  light up.  He immediately said, "You need a new oven circuit board."  He searched on his phone and the part alone was $907 and wasn't available anywhere.  He said he'd try to order it from Korea ( the circuit board is made by Samsung) and it would take months, if he could even get it at all.  I paid him his $69.95 and he left.

After he left I starting searching ebay for refurbished oven circuit boards- $400 and up.  Then I even starting looking at new ovens.  Then I'm so happy called another repair company.  A technician came out the next day.  He spent the time necessary to do a good job.  He starting checking the electrical connections.  He moved the oven out and disassembled some of the oven. He discovered the problem,  that the Reliable repairman who had come back in October had used black electrical tape to connect the new oven ignitor.  Now 4 1/2 months later it had melted and shorted out.  I kept  the wires connected with the black electrical tape to prove it!  This second repairman reconnected the ignitor with ceramic connectors as the repairman from Reliable should have done originally.  This second repairman only charged me $159.00 total and now my oven works great!! I was saved from having to spend a fortune with Reliable.  Reliable owes me
the $159 plus the $69.95 I paid them two days ago!!!!!! If the Reliable technician  had connected the wires properly with the ceramic connectors
to begin with I would have saved that money and a huge headache!!!< /review>

The entire process was smooth Mike came to my house, provided me with a quote, I approved and they were able to schedule and install within a week. They priced competitively, performed an extremely high quality of work, and were very easy to work with!<//Review>< pictures>

Reliable techs were quick, professional and extremely knowledgeable. They fixed my 15 year old dryer, and I’m sure the unit will for a few extra years thanks to the job they’ve done. I also appreciate how responsible they were, wearing masks and gloves to keep me safe. Fantastic service, very pleasant experience!<//text>

I found RAS  by looking at reviews, my dishwasher stopped cleaning properly. Mike did a thorough analysis of my dishwasher, ordered the parts that were needed, and came back the next morning to install them. Service was prompt, professional, friendly, and most importantly, reasonably priced. I wanted to return the favor to anyone looking  for someone to repair their appliances!</review>

"My AC stopped cooling the house and of course, it was unbearably hot outside. I started looking for a company that could fix this problem immediately. And I found it! The technicians was at my house within a couple of hours. Of course, I thought it would be very expensive. However, Michael adequately assessed the essence of the problem and gave me a quote. He made a full diagnosis of my AC and told me the price much less than I thought.
The problem was fixed and now I enjoy the coolness. Thank you very much!"<//Text>

Talk about professionalism. Reliable Appliance Service is prompt, efficient and definitely respectful of their customers’ time. I’ve got my microwave repaired with them in a matter of hours of sending my initial message. This is what we call a job well done. Won’t think twice if I need any unit fixed in the future – will call them at once!< /Review>

My house AC broke right at the beginning of the recent heatwave. I desperately contacted a few AC companies, and Reliable  responded first indicating that they could send someone out the next day. I was helped by Shaun, who did an amazing job quickly fixing my AC unit and giving recommendations to maintain the unit in the future. I would definitely recommend this company!</Review>

First and foremost this is an honest trustworthy company they helped me through the whole process in getting a new furnace from financing to installation. They are polite, clean, efficient and very knowledgeable. Some other reviews have stated they can be steep on pricing but I am willing to pay a little more for the quality service.</Text>

My old refrigerator suddenly stopped working, I was not sure why. I contacted Reliable Appliance Service and they were able to schedule an appointment for me just in a few hours. A very friendly and polite serviceman whose name was Peter arrived on time and got to work straight away. I was really impressed by his tool bag – everything looked so well organized. It occurred to me that it was a tool bag of a true professional who knows where every single tool located and can reach out for it without looking. Peter diagnosed the problem in around ten minutes and was able to fix it within an hour or so. Great job! He was also kind enough to answer my questions without showing any signs of impatience. Awesome experience, thank you!<//text>

My AC has been giving trouble and the repair company I was using only kept milking me for more money to “fix” this and that. So I started searching for another contractor who was honest, professional and trustworthy. Luckily I stumbled upon Reliable, and it was love at the first phone call. From the very beginning they made it clear that they take my issues very seriously and I can count on them. The very same day I had a serviceman in my house fixing my system, and it’s been running smoothly since then. Great experience! You’ve earned your five stars, guys.< /review>

Thanks for the quick response during an obviously touch time. I called these guys about my broken AC yesterday morning, and they were able to send two techs right away. They guys were respectful of my home, wore gloves and masks and didn’t leave any mess. They figured out the problem and fixed it within 45 minor so. It was pleasant to have them around, they just did their job and didn’t talk much. No sales pitches, no pressure for unnecessary parts or services. At the moment I’m enjoying cold air coming from my vents, and if I have any issues in the future, I’ll call this repair company again, without a doubt.<//Text>

<text>I and my husband are tenants at a property in Riverside County. Our landlord sent this company over to fix our AC on several occasions. Our tech, Robert, was in and out within 15-20 minutes. He just went into the kitchen, came out, and said, "Done. Sign here." We didn't even bother to know what the issue was. He was professional with outstanding communication. The invoice stated, 'FIX' under the Description box. Since that time (1 month), our AC is still working without any problems.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I wish I could rate 0! I called 01/07/2021 for over the range microwave repair.  A part had to be ordered and I am still waiting for it (today is 02/25/2021). I put down a $100 deposit. Meanwhile, I have not been contacted with an update, and I have called 4 times and was told that a tech would call me. I still not have not received a call.When I asked if I could cancel my order/service and get my deposit back, I was told that he's just a dispatcher and could not help me with my order because he had no access to it.

Update 03/01/2021:
First off...the response my review is bs...and the email provided does not work! I have the receipt in my hand. I Called Fri,Feb 26th. I figured out that the techs calls were going straight to my vm and I don't have a spam block on my phone. The tech left a message with no callback number telling me he was available today, Mon , March 1st between 3-6. When I called the dispatcher back on the 26th and told her the issue about calls going straight to vm, her response was "what am I supposed to do about that." I told her to give me his number to call back or relay the message to him that I accept the appt. She claimed to relay the message.
Today, Monday March 1st, I called again to make sure my appt was noted. The dispatcher told me I wasn't in the system and kept trying to talk over me as I was explaining the situation. She kept asking me if I was sure I called the right place or if I used a different number so I offered to give her my invoice number  but after she let me speak, she found my account. At this point I just want my deposit back.<//review>

Had an issue with my AC unit not blowing cold air. I decided on RAS who reached out to me quickly. As I don't live at my property, my worry was that they would be late and not take care of the issue. However they were on time, diagnosed and treated the issue, and called me on the phone before leaving my property. My tenants and I both were impressed by their professionalism. I recommend them for AC repairs.</text>

Jacob showed up on time for the 8:00 am appointment to repair my washer. He was knowledgeable and answered all our questions. After diagnostics he said that he need a new part to finish the repair. He ordered the part and was back by the end of the day giving us a properly working washing machine door! Thank you very much!<//Text>

We really appreciated Reliable’s workers and would certainly recommend them. We had a noisy fridge whose temperature was fluctuating. John quickly diagnosed the problem and sorted it out within an hour. He took the time to explain what had gone awry and made a few adjustments that should prevent any future difficulties. Friendly and courteous (we appreciated his phoning before arrival, to let us know he was on the way) - a very good experience.< /text>

The service repair gentlemen who came to inspect my faulty Amana refrigerator was very prompt and extremely helpful. Unfortunately, my fridge was broken due to a coolant leak, but he was completely honest about the diagnosis and gave me good advice on how to follow up on getting rid of it and buying a new unit. Very friendly and honest service, I would definitely call Reliable Appliance Service again.< /Text>

I would like to recommend this company  to anyone who’s experiencing AC problems. My system was not cooling well, and the service tech (Andy) managed to identify the issue almost at once. He explained to me in simple terms what needed to be done and got to work without any further ado. When the problem was fixed, he even climbed to the insulation. Generally speaking, he gave me an impression of being a very knowledgeable, highly qualified professional and a nice person to talk to. My neighbor recommended this repair company to me, and I’m very glad he did. Now it’s my turn to recommend it to my neighbors and friends.</review>

<Review>Alex fixed a rather serious issue with our fridge’s motherboard. I’m glad we didn’t have to go for a new one. The cost was significant, but it’s still nothing in comparison with an amount we would have paid for a new piece. Alex was also punctual - he came on time and did the job in a timely manner. Extremely grateful for the great work!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Kitchen aid refrigerator stopped cooling, I called Reliable Appliance Service in the morning, and scheduled a 3 hour repair window. The technician came right on time, he was professional, knowledgeable and very friendly. I was really surprised with how fast they were able to help me and would recommend their service to anyone looking for a quick fix.</Text>

<Review>If you think  there are no honest contractors left, give Reliable a try. My HVAC was malfunctioning, and I called these guys to get an appointment. Well, I got to meet them earlier than I expected – they were at my door the very same afternoon. It turned out the  problem was hardly worth a visit, and I could even fix it myself if someone gave me proper instructions. What I particularly liked about these guys is that they didn’t try to make something big out of it. They just fixed this minor issue in a  matter  of  ten minutes and bid me goodbye! Fantastic! No upselling, no attempts to get more  money out of me. Thanks for being so honest and trustworthy. 5 stars.</Review>< gmap_id>

Finding the right repair company could be a daunting task. I’ve dealt with many contractors in the past, but only Reliable Appliance Service keeps to the standards that are expected from an AC company. They took care of my aging AC from beginning to end and thereafter. The two serviceman that came were very efficient and prompt – they didn’t stop working until my unit was functional. Now the house is ice cold, and it’s all thanks to these amazing guys! Will always use them from now on.</text>

<review>I am a repeated customer of the Reliable Appliance Service of San Francisco City and let me give you my genuine review about their services.

I am very happy with their services.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

All the technician are very reliable, and my water heater is still operational thanks to their efforts. They’ve been reliable and trustworthy, I never felt as if they were trying to take advantage of my ignorance in repair jobs. Highly recommended!<//Review>< response>

RAS is amazing!!! They have helped us with a water heater replacement, and HVAC/AC maintenance. It is super easy to book an appointment and communicate. The manager response very promptly even after hours. He is always friendly and willing to advise! All of the technicians have been very knowledgeable, polite, patient and trustworthy! They give their honest opinion of the circumstance and go above and beyond on each job. They frequently give tips on how maintain and extend the life of my units. I can't recommend them enough and will definitely continue using them in the future!<//Review>

I am very happy and pleased with the service. I called Saturday because the AC broke down on the hottest day. They said they will send someone either Saturday if not Sunday. They came Sunday and the technician informed us it was the coil which we already suspected. Unfortunately we couldn't do it ourselves . Thankfully they came and repaired it with in 20 minutes. Very nice, friendly and knowledgeable.</Text>

I was just getting the kids’ dinner, and popped a tray into the microwave, and found that the tray refused to turn, and the dinner was ruined. Well, I decided that this would be the only dinner ruined by this machine, and I called in Reliable Appliance Service. I really wanted the machine up and running before I had to get together the next meal. Well, the service was very satisfactory. I wanted the machine repaired, and they did it. The man took apart the unit, much to my satisfaction, and he repaired it, which was even more satisfying. I am very pleased with their service.< /Text>

I want to thank Reliable for fixing my fridge in just 4 days and on site. 4 days because one needed part had to be shipped to them. It took only one technician, Yuri, who did all the work both days Tuesday and Saturday. Tuesday he came, diagnosed quickly and changed an electronics part. I was amazed he had the part in his van. It took him a few minutes to switch it while he shared a lot of information on the appliance. At the end, a crack was found in one of the hoses that feed water to both, filtered water and Ice Maker. That was the part that had to be shipped to them, but the fridge and freezer were working now. On Friday, I thought the weekend was going to be hot without my Ice Maker working. I had no idea they work Saturdays. I missed Yuri's call on Saturday by noon, where he informed me he was 10 minutes away. Then, he shows up and I was more than happy to see him. He changed the hose/s in about 10 minutes, changed the water filter I had also purchased from Reliable since Tuesday, then he gave me some instructions on how to clear the water filter, since it was new and that was it. Total time he was here those two days, was around 40 minutes. The fridge has been running great and I am more than happy, since I had saved at least $2K on a new fridge. All I can say is, thank you Reliable and thank you Yuri.

Sincerely,

Hernan Velasquez<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Wonderful company, very prompt and knowledgeable. Josh has been very helpful with diagnosing issues with my heater. When our 20 years old heating quit working he was out the next day to give us an estimate on a new one. He came back with other technicians within two days to replace it. The job was done excellently! Highly recommend him and this company as well.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I contacted Reliable! I really appreciated John’s courteous and professional manner. He was also very informative about all the steps along the way. I am so happy to have my air conditioner back!!! This system working is essential. Nobody else could come out in under 24 hours and nobody has ever been this extra helpful and kind. I know I have just found the only HVAC company l'm ever going to call again!! Thanks, everyone! And a special thank you, John.</review>< pictures>

<text>I’m very impressed with the service and highly recommend this repair company. A few days ago I discovered my AC was not cooling. I’m new to Oakland, so I did a research thinking of going for the company with lots of positive reviews. This is how I’ve come upon Reliable Appliance Service. They promptly returned my call and were onsite in one hour or so, around 8.30 PM the very same night. The service technician diagnosed a leak in my freon, re-welded the joint and refilled the system with freon. The chill was back within one hour since he showed up. These guys are top notch, will definitely call them again in case of problems with AC (but I hope I won’t have to).</text>< Rate>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>John is a really great guy and I feel he's sincere and gives me advice with my best interest in mind. I feel being considerate and kindness goes a long way and you can tell by how many positive reviews he already has. My AC would only stop working when it was very hot. It was a little frustrating to fix since the problems wouldn't always present themselves. John was really patient. He came out 3 times. And the 3rd time was the charm and he was able to determine my start capacitor was the main issue and I also needed more freeon. He also said my compression was not great but for my situation I might as well use it until it gives out since they're expensive. I appreciate that kind of advice since everyone would like to save money where they can. Of course I would replace it too if he advised that would be best for my machine. He also sent a follow up text the next day to make sure everything was good. I really appreciate his help and I'm happy I found RAS.< /Text><response>None< /response>< rating>

< Review>
I want to thank Reliable for fixing my fridge in just 4 days and on site. 4 days because one needed part had to be shipped to them. It took only one technician, Yuri, who did all the work both days Tuesday and Saturday. Tuesday he came, diagnosed quickly and changed an electronics part. I was amazed he had the part in his van. It took him a few minutes to switch it while he shared a lot of information on the appliance. At the end, a crack was found in one of the hoses that feed water to both, filtered water and Ice Maker. That was the part that had to be shipped to them, but the fridge and freezer were working now. On Friday, I thought the weekend was going to be hot without my Ice Maker working. I had no idea they work Saturdays. I missed Yuri's call on Saturday by noon, where he informed me he was 10 minutes away. Then, he shows up and I was more than happy to see him. He changed the hose/s in about 10 minutes, changed the water filter I had also purchased from Reliable since Tuesday, then he gave me some instructions on how to clear the water filter, since it was new and that was it. Total time he was here those two days, was around 40 minutes. The fridge has been running great and I am more than happy, since I had saved at least $2K on a new fridge. All I can say is, thank you Reliable and thank you Yuri.

Sincerely,

Hernan Velasquez<//Review>

My dishwasher decided to break just before my business trip. It was urgent to get it fixed before my departure since my husband don’t wash up and I’d be greeted with a huge mountain od dirty dishes upon my return. Reliable came to the rescue. The machine was repaired the same day I contacted them. Everything is working well, and I am so relieved. Thank you!<//text>

Pretty satisfied with Reliable Appliance Service after a heater replacement and some other related repairs. Andy checked things out and then was honest and prompt in estimates, scheduling and completing the job. The price is very reasonable. I will be using them again.</Review>

Reliable Appliance Service is the best and only A/C and Heating company I will ever use. Their technicians always spent the time to explain exactly what was happening. They were knowledgeable and professional at each visit. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for good solid quality work and great customer service.</Text>

<review>It’s not hard to see why Reliable Appliance Service gets such great reviews. My old and trusted dishwasher started making a loud noise when running, and after tolerating the problem for a while I decided to call these guys. They processed my inquiry very promptly, and within hours my issue was fixed. It was also extremely kind of them to give me some advice on how to fix the issue without heavy charges from the professionals. Would recommend them without second thought!</review><date>1598874815736<//date>< Response>

The technician showed up during the allotted time. He wore a mask properly and was very professional, which was appreciated. Our AC unit had been leaking a ton of water and he explained it was due to a clogged line. He was able to fix it right then and there. Very happy with the services provided. Thank you!!!< /Review>

I needed my AC installed and they came out right when they said they would. Technicians were professional, knowledgeable, and prompt. They tested the Air Conditioning to check if all works well.

It was by chance that I saw Reliable Appliance Service truck near my neighbor’s house. The serviceman were installing an air conditioning system. It reminded me my own AC had been giving trouble since forever, but I kept postponing getting it fixed. An average repair company is such a pain. Always late, always upselling, always leave a big mess in the house. My experience with these guys was entirely different though. They arrived on time, explained the cost involved and did an excellent job locating a minor leak and fixing it. They also respected my home and left it neat and tidy. They deserve five stars, it’s one of the few repair companies that doesn’t give you any headache!<//review>

<Review>It’s amazing how an incompetent repair company can scar you for life. I had a very negative experience with my previous  go-to company, and when I AC went out I was seriously considering whether  I could live without air conditioning my home. But  eventually I decided to behave like an adult and called Reliable. I think my neighbour recommended them at some point, so I had this company’s number. They sent someone  out the same day! But let’s cut to the chase, the AC got fixed, although it was quite challenging to get it up and running. My home is  full of cold air at the moment, and  my heart is full of gratitude. I highly recommend this contractor.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1600445782505</Time><user_id>115243370769145756564< /user_id><Name>Terrill Kassulke<//Name><pics>None</pics><Rate>5</Rate>< gmapID>

I've called Reliable Appliance Service for many jobs; some routine and some urgent. Our older heat pump was not keeping up with the 90+ temperatures last week, and I called at 8:10 PM Friday. Mike came at 9:15 AM the next day. He was friendly and fair with estimation. After his diagnostics, we decided to replace the whole system. Technicians came again the next morning and finished their job by 2:00 PM. I am very grateful for these guys!< /Text>

The history of my fairly new oven’s repairs had been very annoying until I come upon Reliable Appliance Service. The guys were prompt, professional and efficient. They quickly diagnosed the problem (it had something to do with a faulty heating element), fixed it and explained how to avoid similar issues in the future. There was no pressure to make me buy expensive parts – the guys were extremely honest and helpful. The oven works well, I have no complains. Couldn’t be happier with the service, 5 stars!<//text>

My washer had a problem with the timer, and I called Reliable to help me out. The repairmen showed up on time and fixed the problem in twenty minutes or so. It was a great experience using the services of someone so experienced and well-informed. Will call them again if I ever need it. You’ve got another loyal customer, guys!</text>

Great Experience! My refrigerator stopped working and I was recommended this company by a friend. I was able to get same day service.

I rent out a series  of apartments  over the short term, and if anything goes wrong with air conditioning in any of them, I need people who respond very quickly and efficiently, and who would  be polite to  my clients.  Well, RAS really deliver it and continues to do so. Whenever there is a  problem with the units  in one  of my apartments, I just have to call them up, and they send someone out right away. By the end of the day units are up and running again. These people don’t leave a big mess behind them, and their servicemen are very courteous with my clients, which keeps my clients happy. This company has really reduced the stress in my life.< /Text>

<review>This company works hard to remain competitive and to stay at the top of the industry. When my washing machine stopped working, I talked to them about the problem, and how much they thought it would cost to repair it, and they offered me a very competitive pricing system. After they repaired the machine, the bill they gave me was pretty much what they estimated, which I found very affordable.</review><resp>None<//resp>< name>

I have experience with service for three houses, and I have been happy with their regular service and repairs. Recently I called a technician to fix my AC. He did it and gave me several useful tips for keeping it in good order. I have also used RAS to install a whole new HVAC system at one house, and all went well. Also, the price was good.</review>

This company never disappoints. Today Reliable‘s technician John diagnosed and repaired the issue with my dishwasher's air gap. Then he inspected my dishwasher, gave me cleaning tips and taught me how to periodically clean the air gap's tubing in order to prevent the reason for his service visit today. There is a reason these guys consistently receives top reviews: they are the best in the San Bernardino!<//text>

Beware! Any business that respond to negative online reviews by disparaging the reviewing customer as “scam review by a competing business”, responding with sarcasm “our technician did not magically appear”, or plain insult “you’re crazy”, is probably not a business engaging in customer service oriented services.<//review>

Had a technician come out to repair my refrigerator this morning. He was timely, professional, and honest! He called me when he was on his way and completed the job within an hour. When an appliance breaks down it can always be a hassle, but the technician's timely response and service made it a lot easier. Thanks, RAS!</text>

I needed someone to clean up a high buildup on the AC’s condenser coil. The job wasn’t urgent, but Reliable send out Gilbert, the service technician, the very same day. He serviced the unit thoroughly and even checked the system for leaks. All the Covid precautions were in place. Excellent service, will definitely use this company if my appliances need repair. Thanks a lot!<//Text>

They showed their professionalism and do work fine & quickly. They hold true to their price statement and stand behind their work. I am so happy!</Review>< Response>

Before Reliable Appliance Service of San Francisco fixed my refrigerator, the refrigerator was not making life easy for me at all. They set my mind at ease with that first call with wonderful customer service. They assured me someone would be over to take a look at my fridge the same day. My service tech was Chris. He found the problem right away and replaced the part. I would highly recommend this service.</Text>

Andrew is responsive to my call and very knowledgeable about HVAC units. My heat wasn't working when it was 0 degrees out. I called him and he was able to come by within an hour to diagnose and fix the issue. I would recommend him to anyone needing a new system or to troubleshoot a problem.

<text>I suspected the coolant in my air conditioner was insufficient (high electricity bills, low efficiency), so I finally decided to get my system refilled with freon. I would have done it earlier, but the problem is, I’m almost never at home in daytime (balancing work in two places). When I got an occasional day off, I tried my best to find a contractor who would sent out a repairman the very same day. Unfortunately, everyone was booked. Fortunately, I’ve come upon RAS. This wonderful repair company was very helpful from start to finish. They send out a very well-informed technician who quickly found the leaks, repaired the damaged pipes and refilled the system. He was wearing gloves and mask and did his best to keep a safe distance as a covid precaution. Great job!</text>< Pics>

< Review>
They helped me repair my washing machine and refrigerator water dispenser. The first trip my tech, Mike, made to my house, he was late because parking is difficult in my neighborhood. But called and texted a few times in advance to let me know. He came over and analyzed the situation, and took a photo of the serial number and model number of my washing machine. Mike said it would be about a week to get parts in, but he would call me with pricing beforehand. A few days later, he called to quote me a price . A couple of weeks later, he returned to do the needed repair. It took him a couple of hours but he did it. We tested the washer while he was there and everything worked tremendously. I would definitely recommend to anyone this  appliance service.<//Review>

<Review>My fridge stopped working on a Sunday. They responded to my request right away and Mike was able to check out the fridge Monday evening. Mike diagnosed the problem and came back early the next morning to fix it. The entire experience was absolutely fantastic. He even contacted me a few days later to make sure everything was ok. I will definitely be turning to him if anything else is wrong.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We called for emergency service and the technician came within an hour. Anthony has helped us figure out our AC issues one piece at a time instead of just recommending a whole new unit that we don’t even need. Highly recommend their services if you would like the job done correctly the first time.</text>

Professional and quick service. I found all the staff to be very helpful and friendly. Appreciated that they were easy to get ahold of and gave me an accurate window of when they would arrive. Followed covid precautions and social distancing well. The staff was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions and made great suggestions for general and quick installation of my AC that saved me money in the long run. Also found their quotes to be competitive.</Text>

<Text>I’ve always  hated the technicians who don’t think about the  mess they make of your house while they work. Doing the  job is one thing, but leaving behind an enormous mess to clean up is unacceptable. That said, I was so pleased with the way Reliable worked. The service guy opened up my machine, worked  on it, got it working gain, and then cleaned up after himself, and that’s really more than I’ve come to expect from any serviceman in the industry. Five stars.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I needed someone to clean up a high buildup on the AC’s condenser coil. The job wasn’t urgent, but Reliable send out Gilbert, the service technician, the very same day. He serviced the unit thoroughly and even checked the system for leaks. All the Covid precautions were in place. Excellent service, will definitely use this company if my appliances need repair. Thanks a lot!</Text>

The service was great! We are very happy with Mark and Nick for diagnosing, repairing, and following up on our A/C issue. They arrived on time and had on a mask; they are serious about Covid-19 safety. Yes the AC unit was repaired, yes the entire teams' communication skills were exemplary - but honesty that's priceless. We will be using them again.<//text>

When I was cooking I realized that the front burner on my electric range did not work, and my neighbor told me about this company. I had called Reliable Appliance Service in San Francisco and in less then a few hours they came and fixed everything. I'll call you guys back again in the future and thank you so much for your professionalism.</Review>

<text>These guys was fantastic! They answered my call right away, got me scheduled the same day and gave me a fair estimate. My heater repair was prompt, the serviceman checked his work before leaving to make sure everything was working properly. He also told me how to avoid issues that could cause my heater’s breakdown again. Will call them again for any repair needs in the future.< /text><Name>Nia Walker< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Thank you RAS! Andrew was great! The problem was solved with the AC unit. The tech showed me what he was doing and what was going on so I understood. I initially thought it was refrigerant, and that is why my unit wasn't cooling... It wasn't. Power tripped and blew a coil.  Andrew had the part, he was able to replace it and was wearing a face mask the entire time!! Thank you, Andrew, and Reliable for keeping me safe during COVID by wearing a mask and keeping my house cool! Definitely my first call next time!<//Review>< pics>

My range top was overheating for almost a week. I couldn't find the cause of the issue, so I decide to call Reliable Appliance Service. The service guy arrived at the house looking extremely professional and friendly, he wore a face mask. He explained everything, and went right to work with my range top that were not correctly, found the main problem, and fixed it in less than an hour. Highly recommended!<//review>

<Review>This rating is for Mike, whom I used several times for diagnosing and repair work with my washer and dryers. He was professional with a friendly demeanor. He is so punctual and calls when on his way. He wore his protection mask during work, it’s very important due to COVID. He responds to all my concerns and questions, which is so appreciated. Thank you, Mike. God bless.</Review>< Resp>

<date>1599504249857<//date><Text>My Amana AC started malfunctioning a few days back. When I turned it on, it seemed to start and stop all the time. I contacted over five repair companies, and none of them could schedule my appointment this week. Fortunately I came upon Reliable Appliance Service who position themselves as “same day service”. I was rather doubtful when I called them, but they really sent a technician within a few hours. He even texted me to let me know he was on the way. He quickly determined the problem – it was the blown motor, and worked his magic for an hour or so. I was cool and comfortable the very same evening. Couldn’t be more grateful for the service!!</Text><user_id>116996244442063687236< /user_id><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

<text>My washer was draining very slowly, and there was always leftover water in the machine after the cycle is done. The issue looked serious to me, and I decided to call a repair company. Someone recommended Reliable Appliance Service, and I called them about my issue. They contacted me in just a few minutes and scheduled an appointment within two hours. Jeff the repayment arrived on time and got straight to work. He cleaned the filters thoroughly and did some other manipulations, and voila, my washer stopped giving any trouble whatsoever.

My washer broke and Reliable Appliance was able to get someone out the very next day thankfully! Steve was open and honest about issues that occur with current appliance. He fixed the problem within 30 minutes. I was very happy. I will 100% choose and recommend this company!<//text>

<Review>The problem with my Samsung washer is fixed. About a week later now the machine is still working without issue. The technician was very thoughtful in addition to knowledgeable. He answered my questions directly and didn't treat me like I was getting in the way. Excellent customer service from the tech and customer service over the phone was very friendly too. Thank you, RAS!<//Review>< Rating>

The problem we had with our Wolf cooktop that was not igniting was repaired by this company's expert technician. I called them for quick assistance, and I received the same day service. The repairman was prompt and professional. The quality of the repair satisfied me. I was happy that it worked well again. Exemplary service!</Review>

I had loud noises coming from the fridge. At Reliable Appliance Service were able to schedule quickly, even in the situation when it wasn't an emergency. Handyman was able to determine the cause quickly, that’s a big plus. There was no up selling or anything. Overall, it was very quick and budget-friendly and I'll be calling them next time if needed.</Review>

<review>My washer was draining very slowly, and there was always leftover water in the machine after the cycle is done. The issue looked serious to me, and I decided to call a repair company. Someone recommended Reliable Appliance Service, and I called them about my issue. They contacted me in just a few minutes and scheduled an appointment within two hours. Jeff the repayment arrived on time and got straight to work. He cleaned the filters thoroughly and did some other manipulations, and voila, my washer stopped giving any trouble whatsoever. Thank you!</review>< resp>

My Whirlpool refrigerator broke. A very nice man named Jonathan came within an hour (as opposed to another company, who said they could be here in 10 days!). He knew just what was wrong with it, ordered the part, and came back when he said he would. Walked me thru everything he was doing and said to call anytime with questions. Very nice service!</text>

I needed service for my Goodman furnace over a weekend and this company was able to come on Sunday for a service call fee of just $69.99 (applicable to any repair charges).  The technician arrived timely and was both personable and efficient.  After a 10-15 minute check of my system, he diagnosed the problem as a "defective high limit thermostat," the repair of which required ordering a "high limit thermostat kit" from Goodman at a total cost of $400 (including the $70 service fee already paid).  I thought this was high, told the tech I'd wanted to get other estimates and that I would contact the office if I wanted to go forward.  I then spent some time on YouTube and learned: (1) That the small part in question is a specialized switch (not a "kit") which installs with one screw and can be ordered online from multiple vendors for ~$6 + shipping;  (2) How to easily test whether my part was defective using an ohm meter (I did that and determined that the part was not defective); and (3) That the commonest cause my specific problem was a clogged air filter.  So, I reinserted the same switch, reconnected it to its 2 wires, replaced the air filter (even though it appeared to be ok), turned the furnace on and discovered that --- it now works just fine.  Anyone reading this review should  consider whether this is an appliance repair company they wish to engage.</text>

Excited for something else to break so we can have them back out. Ok, maybe that’s too far. But, I will surely recommend this company for your appliance needs!</Text>< pictures>

<text>What I liked about RAS the most is that they managed to get a serviceman out to me the very same day. He showed up promptly and was very well-spoken and friendly. I explained the problem I was having with my HVAC, and he identified the issue within minutes. He also took trouble to explain everything to me in clear terms – what went wrong, what parts I’d need, why the cost was like that and so on. I couldn’t be happier with the service. 5 stars !<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>The name  "Reliable" is so far from reality I don't know where to start.  I left work early for an appointment between 2 and 5.  After 5, I called and was told politely that the tech, Victor, would call.  Waited a half hour.  Nothing.  Called again and the dispatcher said that he knew some techs are running late.  I asked if he could contact Victor.  He said he could reschedule or I could just wait.  Another call 15 minutes later to them, and they said the tech would call.  I understand that there are delays, but not calling and being snarky does not make businesses keep their clients.  This business has competitors.  I suggest you use them.

Follow up-- Finally got a call from the tech a half hour after I cancelled.  The dispatcher Marissa, wouldn't give me her boss, Peter's last name.  I suspect that I'm not the first to experience this incredibly bad customer service.   I just saw their Yelp reviews... Looks like I dodged a bullet.  Beware!<//review><date>1599880697225<//date>< user_name>

Reliable has repaired 3 of my appliances. Every time they have arrived on time and displayed the utmost professionaiismand courtesy. I've never feltthat I was being ripped off based on theirrecommendations and repairs were handled promptly. Michael repaired both my dryer and washer. Michael stated he was not sure what part would repair the washer but he had both and would install the cheaper of the 2 first to see if that took care of the problem. I was expecting the higher priced part to resolve the issue but much too my surprise the cheaper part took care of the problem.I appreciate the honesty and integrity Reliable incorporates when dealing with me as a consumer.<//Review>

At Reliable Appliance Service was able to schedule me for an appointment in the nearest time when others rejected my request. Tim was always in touch until he arrived and did high quality work with my dryers. He even showed me the broken parts and told what the problem was. Highly recommend their services to others living in Santa Monica.< /review>

John the technician that came out the same day was very helpful and knowledgeable throughout the entire project. He found the issue fast, had the part for the condenser, which was a HUGE plus, and changed it in minutes.

<Review>Very happy with the service. I had a problem with my washing machine and they sent a handyman over that day. He tested the machine, figured out the problem, went back to the repair shop to pick up the part I needed, returned promptly and got the problem fixed. Don’t hesitate contacting Reliable if you have a problem with any of your appliances!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< time>

They repaired my dryer and I couldn’t be happier. The gentleman on the phone did a great job of letting me know the process. Technician Eddie was very patient and took initiative to find alternative solutions to my dryer’s problem without first recommending the expensive route. Now, the dryer is working great! Thank you!<//Review>

My experience working with RAS was great. The technician, Mike, was very nice, followed the Covid recommended protocols and was very respectful of my home, making sure not to hit my walls and doors with his equipment and dryer parts, due to the limited space of my laundry room. He was able to get my dryer back working in about an hour!<//Review>

Terrible Service + Customer Service.

I really wish I read the reviews here before scheduling this company -- Shady!!! We needed a small part fixed on our oven. I watched the technician pull a repair estimate out of his head "$600.00, he said" And said he would get me a hard cost the next day. I never heard from him.

On top of that, the technician did not follow COVID procedures as his mask was just barely covering his mouth, not his nose, the whole time he was in my house. He was also not the least bit friendly.

When I called to ask for a refund, the manager was rude and argumentatively declined my request.

Update: as you can see from the company's response to my honest review - They are now questioning my character and calling me a liar, denying the fact that their technician was not wearing his mask properly in my home.< /Text>

<Text>My elderly Mother had this company come out to check her air conditioner.  It was working but it was not getting as cold as it used to so we thought it needed the refrigerant recharged.  The service man that came out told her that the refrigerant was full and that he could not fix it and the unit needed to be replaced.  She did not want them to replace it at the moment so the service man charge her $69 for a service call and was on his way.  the next day we had another company come check it out and they found the refrigerant was low and recharged it.  It is now working perfectly again.

Had a problem with our HVAC not blowing hot air. Called RAS yesterday and set up an appointment. Even talking on the phone about the problems occurring the tech, Mike,  suspected the culprit was the thermostat.. of course, he was right! I knew right away we had found something exclusive- a great knowledgeable professional. He understood the needs when it comes to providing great service. Mike had it fixed up in a jiff - even taking the time to walk me through the thermostat setup and answer any questions that I had in the process.< /Text>

RAS has been in the business for years and is very knowledgeable. Do not hesitate to hire them for your HVAC needs!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

They answered my first call, set expectations, offered communications options, and we worked out a time to meet at the location of the appliance. The technician was on time, was able to source parts immediately, and completed the repair the same day. Other sources I contacted would come to diagnose, then choose parts, and then come back to repair. Unnecessarily costly and time-consuming. But RAS exceeded my expectations and will be my go-to provider for appliance repair going forward.< /Text>

I had a broken water heater and a leaky fridge. They scheduled their repairman to come same day. Tim was prompt, friendly, considerate, and very knowledgeable. He had explained everything before the repair and answered questions I had throughout the repair. Thanks, Reliable Appliance Service and Tim!< /Review>

My washing machine broke Sunday morning. Daniel came Sunday afternoon to diagnose the problem. He didn't have the part (lid switch) that was needed, so he left saying he'd get the part and come back the next day. Monday morning, Daniel called me to let me know he was ordering the part. And he came at 7:00 pm with the part and fixed it. I can't imagine the service being any better or faster.</text>

<review>My Samsung refrigerator started leaking excessively, I mean, water was everywhere. I called RAS and they were able to come out the same day. Mike  came out and first off, got the water to stop. He found that one of the drains was clogged and cleared it up. He said that he will look up the schematics and find out the issue and get it fixed once and for all. Thank you! Will definitely call back when the need comes up.<//review>< time>

My mother's old AC system needed replacement. So she asked me to help her coordinate this. I really wanted to find someone who wouldn't see an older woman and take advantage of the fact and quote her outrageous prices. The team at RAS was very patient with me and my mom as they kept having to contact me with any questions and the payment process.  The manager was extremely knowledgeable and helped to make sure everything was handled properly. I highly recommend using them. The crew that was at my mother's home had the airflow/ temperature control in the house working smoother than ever! I'm so happy I called and they followed thru with everything that was originally promissd!< /review>

< review>
The technician, Tony, took some photos and talked over the phone and told us the freezer is low freon level. He gave us a quote of $2500 for this repair and charged us for $69.95. We hired another company and found out it was just the sensor.  Got it fixed with just $150. Now, it's functioning ok.< /review>
<Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1611862745370, 'text': 'According to another company invoice under parts all was used was a refrigerant because it was low on Freon, no sensor was replaced, which was the same diagnoses provided by us. Also according to another company invoice it states that possibly a compressor replacement maybe needed, which is something we expressed as well. Moreover a refrigeration system is called a sealed system for a reason, missing refrigerant means there is a leak, just adding refrigerant is not a repair, it will last for sometime until it will leak out again and you will be back to square one. Our estimate for the work was higher but it included a full repair solution rather then a bandaid repair, it’s only a matter of time before repairs we suggested will need to be done, by doing it right the first time is less costly as you would not need to spend money on repairs that will not work in the long run and possible lead to other parts failure as well. Fo Guan Shan Hsi Fang Temple, please send the invoice from the other service provider to our manager for review peter.york@reliableserviceco.com.'}</response>

Most amazing customer service l've worked with for any kind of appliance. We came home from a weekend away to find our fridge and freezer weren't working, and RAS has just been so easy to work with to get things fixed, even in the time of COVID. They went out of their way to repaired our fridge. They have been incredibly fast and professional to deal with. Can't recommend them more highly.<//Review>

We contacted Reliable Appliance because our fridge was not cooling properly.  Yuriy was sent out on short notice, identified the problem, and ordered the parts. He was knowledgable, polite, and fixed the refrigerator within a day of receiving the parts.
We highly recommend the company and especially this technician.</text>< pictures>

Timely service on a Tuesday for Electrolux washer repair that was leaking. The repairman actually arrived on time and made what I thought to be a huge problem look like a piece of cake. He quickly assessed the problem, showed me what was causing all the trouble and luckily he had parts in his truck to fix it. Highly recommend this company to others in need of appliance repair and service.< /Review>

We came home from a weekend away to find our fridge and freezer weren't working, and RAS has just been so easy to work with to get things fixed, even in the time of COVID. They went out of their way to repaired our fridge. They have been incredibly fast and professional to deal with. Can't recommend them more highly.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>My dryer was not heating and I decided to call Reliable Appliance Repair this morning. The technician came before noon and spent only 15 minutes to diagnose the problem. John replaced the needed part and in the next hour, I get properly working dryer. I would use them again, but I don't think I'll need to. Thank you, John! God bless!< /Text>< pics>

<review>Our technician was running a bit late but when he arrived he was very professional and geared up properly for Covid 19 as we are being quarantined currently. We appreciate all the essential workers right now especially our technician today. He determined the problem and fixed it in less than 30 mins time. I'm happy we didnt have to replace our appliance for now. Very happy with the service provided by RAS.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>George of Reliable Appliance Service of Poway came at a time to our house to resolve problems we were having with our washer and microwave. He was extremely professional and very pleasant and was able to fix our microwave during that first visit. Our washer, even so, needed a part. He came back in 3 working days and finished his job with our washer. By the way, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he wore a face mask and gloves during his visits, and we greatly appreciated that courtesy. I highly recommend Reliable Appliance Service of Poway for any problems with appliances. The service was great!

I am changing my review to four stars as I received a call from Peter after I posted the below review. Peter, a manager, immediately apologized for the poor experience, indicating that it shouldn't take a review to receive a response. He indicated that my call should have been forwarded to him when the supervisor failed to respond. I agreed. I explained to Peter that I had already contacted another service company and that they were in the process of their service call. Peter was very understanding and apologetic and indicated that he wanted to make things right. Great response although I wasn't certain how since I was already working with a different company. That didn't deter Peter as he offered me a partial refund of my first visit with them. It was a respectable amount.  Something you don't see very often these days. I appreciated the quick response.  To err is human, to own it is professionalism. Thanks, Peter.

Zero stars for reliable Appliance. I had them come fix an LG Washer/Dryer combo. Took 3 weeks for repair to be completed. Okay, it's the middle of a COVID-19 Pandemic so I can understand delays in parts. The technician Erik complained about being tired and seemed a bit grumpy. Okay again, it's the middle of a COVID-19 Pandemic so I can understand not everyone is feeling the love.  Two weeks after it is fixed, I press the power button, nothing. I call Reliable Appliance again to have them come out. Was told Erik is no longer working and they need to contact a Supervisor for instructions. Not sure why but okay, I'll roll with it.  One week later and 5 calls down and still no appointment. Supervisor isn't calling anyone back. I even had one of the customer service calls suggest sending Erik back out until I reminded him that during the last call I was informed Erik was no longer with them. Sigh...
And in case you indicate that I did not call.  August 14th @ 3:41PM, August 17th @10:08 AM, September 24th @ 8:44 AM, September 25th @ 6:00pm, September 28th @ 5:54 pm and September 29th @ 10:03AM</Text>

Awesome! I had 2 Amana 12k BTU mini split systems installed on the 2nd floor. Tim and John were right on time and with great knowledges about AC systems. They did very good work with the full explanations throughout the process. I paid for the quality and I received it. Very nice experience. I recommend this company for any AC issues!< /Review>

We called Reliable Appliance Service to repair our Modine Heater that was not working properly. The technician was very fair. He checked up our machine and find that it was not the issue with any part. Theproblem was, that we had a birds nest in the exhaust pipe.He cleaned it out and now I live in heat :)<//Text>

My dryer had been making weird noises for about a few weeks and I didn’t think much of it until this last cycle that ran and when it was done, I checked and my clothes were still soaked. I thought okay now something is really wrong. I called this place and a man by the name of Dustin provided me with best customer service out of all the places I had called. I decided I wanted this place to get the job done, and they did not disappoint! I highly recommend this to any and all who have appliance issues.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Excellent Fast service from Reliable Appliance Service.Fuse installation was done in timely manner, they checked up to make sure we have no issues, wet spots or leaks.On top of that, pricing was very reasonable and could not be happier going with them.< /text>

My parents are both older and had their heater go out in the middle of the night. Anybody with parents at that stage know how bad that can be I’m sure. But I called reliable services and they had a nice young man out here first thing in the morning! Excellent service!< /Text>

Woke up to a leaking refrigerator. Called subzero but they were booked 2 weeks out! Then called these guys and I have a working, non-leaking refrigerator. Easy 30 minute repair. Will recommend.</Review>

I found my refrigerator doesn’t work anymore before going to the work. I needed someone out right away but scheduled around meetings that day. They were right on time, called before arriving and technician wore all COVID19 protection (shoe covers, gloves and mask), before entering my house. I will use them next time I need my refrigerator repaired.</review>

After calling a few other companies to have my refrigerator fixed, Reliable Appliance was able to send someone out same day and within a few hours.  Eddie seemed very knowledgeable and was able to diagnose and fix my fridge rather quickly, and for a reasonable price.  Thank you, RAS!< /review>

<text>I have used Reliable twice, I had amazing services done by there technicians I will continue to use them. The process is very simple I call in to set up the appointment with a service representative and they send out a technician that same day! There very nice and knowledgeable individuals, they really know what there doing. The customer service has been great up to this point, they make sure I'm being taken care of and they go above and beyond with any questions or concerns I have. Good job Reliable! Keep doing what you are doing!</text><user_id>112670498486212800273</user_id><username>Gonzalo Sandoval</username><Time>1552515608047</Time><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Konstantin and Ross came out and repaired our AC, for some reason only hot air was blowing out from the vents. Initially we thought it was the coil that froze over due to an old air filter. When that didn’t work we noticed that the outside the fan wasn’t working and Ross and Konstantin came to the rescue and repaired it. I appreciated their advice and them coming on such short notice to get things fixed on a Friday night initially and then on Labor Day Monday. Such gentleman and I would recommend their services in the future.<//Review>

They sold me an external.unit two years ago for 50%  more than the market price. The unit was $950 everywhere and they chathed me close to $4k with labor which took less than 40 minutes. I had a tenant and had to say yes before making a research. This is not my problem with the company. They like to take advantage of peoples situations. I had a tenant and had to rep lmk ace the unit. They first quote was 2500 and when I called them to schedule service they knowingly bumped up the price to 3500 and topk advantage of my situation.
I learned this later. I called them again after two years to clean the internal.unit and they tried to sell me new unit for a ridicilous price again. Same ignorance, not.focusing on the problem. Water was not draining because of a clogged condensation line. The tech didnt even bothered to open the panel or anything. I was able to clean my condensation lines by another service provider because they refused to service. Clea ing took leas than 15 minutes. Now everything works as expected.  They told it is a Plummer work😂🤦‍♂️ just because they didnt want to clean the condensation line and make 200 in 30 minutes. Instead they like to make 4-5k by installing a new unit within an hour.  They told it is old and will keep clogging. I had to call them 5 times and schedule two services to get it cleaned with the jacked up price they asked but they even refused to do the work.  these guys are joke. STAY AWAY!
A simple local company came and opened the line, cleaned the dust and mud caused by it and that's it! There wasn't any corrosion or anything wrong with the unit.

This company should not be in the business! Work with a local small business for true reliable service!<//Review>< Pictures>

The technician went to my place and did the ocular inspection to my AC. My complain was the water leak from my ceiling. He just looked and told me the problem was the coil thats why its leaking. We have to replace the whole unit. And he's charging me $6700 and not doing further investigation. I told him I will ask for 2nd opinion and will call him. He took off with $70 from my pocket. He spent only less than 30 mins. with me and charged me $70.
As soon as he left, I did my own investigation with the help of my AC technician friend on the phone. While he's telling what to do, we found out that it wasnt the AC where the leak coming from. It is the water line.
It means that the technician lied, my AC is not broken. Good thing I did not fall for him. I will not recommend this 100%.<//Review>

We had Reliable Appliance Service come out to our house on 6/15/19. We explained to the young man that came out the problem with our stove he automatically said he knew what it was without even looking at it then left. He ordered the part and said he would call us when the part came in... it took 4 weeks for the part to arrive - Wow!!! He rescheduled to come back to our house to install the new part. When he came out he realized he had ordered the wrong part. We were like really?! This could have been avoided if he would have first looked at it in the beginning.  Now it’s 8/18/19 and we still are waiting for the new part and we haven’t had a working stove/oven in our house for over two months.  This is extremely inconvenient for a family and children! Plus expensive eating out, having to use the microwave or bbq grill.

We’ve tried to contact the company multiple times last week and nobody is returning our phone calls. At this point we just want our money back.  Save yourself a headache people please and call a TRUE RELIABLE company!<//review>

I have used reliable a couple of times for my appliances. Getting a same day appointment is great but with my schedule is sort of difficult. But they are very accommodating to my schedule. I’ve recommended them to my aunt and she has used them  too. They are great, I keep their magnet right on my fridge so I can call them when I need too.< /Text>

Been using Reliable for a while now. Great service each time!! This is the company I can trust! Their pricing is reasonable and competitive. I had a technician Paul out for my AC repair last summer. We called a few companies and no one could come out the same day... heat season is no fun! Paul came out and determined the problem within minutes!!! He did not try to sell us a brand new unit to make money off of us. He was understanding of the budget line. He did his best to work with what was at hand. Our AC is still working great!!! No issues whatsoever!! We will definitely be calling them again for all AC related issues! Thanks Reliable!!</text>

Excellent service!   5 star.  Very reasonable price to fix $1000 gas dryer.  Very efficient and also replaced a part for free.   Cleaned entire dryer as well.  Bill was our service person. Would definitely use again.<//Review>

Reliable service is so great. The technician Sergio is so helpful and very punctual. I had a small problem with my dryer and he explained everything to me. 10/10 customer service. Would recommend all my family and friends and neighbors. Next time I have an issue I’ll be for sure to call Sergio the technician from reliable service</text>

Previously I had called another company to come service my heater and they were charging me a ridiculously amount of money to just service my appliance . So I decided to get a second opinion and I’m glad I did . Leo explained step by step what service I needed to get my appliance up and running and prices were reasonable. I’m glad I called reliable . I highly recommend this company to anyone looking to fix their ac/heater unit .< /review>< Pics>

This past Sunday I called Reliable for my oven that had locked during a self cleaning and it never unlocked itself. I thought to myself it should be a simple fix and messed with it a little bit but didn't have any luck. Reliable sent out Bill that same day and he was able to get it open and he even showed me how to prevent my oven from not unlocking.</Review>

< Review>
My family and I are tenants at a property in Orange County. Our landlord sent this company over to fix our microwave on several occasions. Our first tech, Robert, was in and out within 5-10 minutes. He just went into the kitchen, came out, and said, "Done. Sign here." He didn't even bother to let us know what the issue was. I asked him and he said, "fuse." Clearly he was a man of little to no words, so I didn't press him on it. The invoice stated, 'FIX' under the Description box. At that point, I didn't care too much -- as long as our microwave was working again.... or not. It ended up breaking again 2 weeks later. The same thing happened. Same Robert dude came to fix it, said nothing, and vanished. AAAAndddd then it broke again the following week. At that point, the landlord wanted to check if electrical was the issue rather than the microwave, so we didn't contact him again. Each time Robert came in, he charged us $100! Rip off.

Fast forward to a few months later. Electrical wasn't the issue and it was the microwave, so our landlord sent this company again. Dan came to look at the microwave this time. He was a grouch coming in, but that's his issue - not mine. So, I didn't let it affect anything. After looking into the microwave, he gave a quote to fix the fuse for $227. I told him I'd ask our landlord and he kind of scoffed at me. Our landlord asked for the tech's input on getting a new microwave vs. fixing the fuse. Dan scoffed and mumbled something. He was clearly upset. I updated Dan on our landlord's final decision to forego the repair and to just pay the service fee. Dan's response was, "You kidding me? I drove all the way here?!" (scoff scoff scoff). I didn't realize this company was from El Cajon, so I do agree it was a bit of a drive for him, but that wasn't something to take out on a customer. If the company has an issue with traveling out to Orange County, they probably shouldn't be accepting service requests here to begin with.

Overall, I'm not surprised that this company has an overall 1.5 Yelp rating. To many reviewer's points, this place is overpriced and our experience with them was horrible customer service.< /Review>

I only have 1 regret about this whole fridge ordeal - I wish I would have called Reliable sooner!</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I should have written this review a long time age. I have been using Reliable Appliance Service Inc. company now for about 3 years, in that time they have been out to my home about 4 times. I can't say enough about this company.. I appreciate how honest they have been & how reasonable the prices are. I'm convinced they can fix ANYTHING! I highly recommend this company for all your appliance/HVAC repair needs.</review>

Water “Waterlawyer” Lawyer</name>
<text>This is an addendum to two months ago.  I disputed the bill with my bank and the manager called me constantly from multiple phones after I blocked his phone number.  I had to call the police because he was threatening me.  Two weeks later the refrigerator stopped working all together.  Even though it was on warranty I was afraid of these angry people.  I called a reputable repair company and they said there wasn’t enough Freon.  Reliable said the cost of Freon was $1200 because he had to weld and he torched the paint on my kitchen cabinets while supposedly adding Freon.  The reputable repairman said welding was not necessary to add Freon to my refrigerator.  He also said where Reliable said the problem was the fan which he charged me an additional  $850 for 10 minutes and a $33 part, this guy said that wasn’t even the problem it was the condenser.  Scary experience dealing with Reliable Appliance Repair.< /text></record>

The repair guy came out and turned the machine on for about ten seconds and told me I need a new dishwasher because the repair would cost over $700. No trouble shooting whatsoever. He didn't even look up the error code. He then went on to say I should not buy Samsung appliances because they aren't very good. He spent a total of ten minutes here and charged me $70.

Awesome service. My hot water heater went out. Was referred to them by a friend that had dealt with them before. From the time I called and the new hot water was replaced, it was a matter of a few hours. I will definitely use them again for anything that comes up. And highly recommend them</text>

My mom's wall heater broke right when we had all the cold weather coming in, she's a senior citizen so she needs a working wall heater. I called around in a panic to different places and everywhere was in a month, two weeks, etc. I got reliable and they were able to send Andrei out same day and he repaired it by the end of the day! My mother and I loved the service and they offered a discount because she was a senior citizen!</review>

Absolute worst service company I have ever dealt with. Technician Freddy didn’t even show up the day he was supposed to and lied about it. When he finally did show up weeks later, we then got charged for a part that still hasn’t been installed in over 7 weeks. Five calls to the company and several requests to talk to supervisors and still no response. Please find someone else to work with unless you want to be overcharged and the service never completed.</Review>

Bob came out to fix my oven on Tuesday and my oven was fixed by Thursday! Just in time to bake for my daughters school bake sale. Bob was able to answer all my questions as to what went wrong with it in the first place and how to prevent it for next time. The receptionist was kind and professional and the technician was efficient and knowledgable! Would definitely use this company again.<//text>

<review>I had a great experience Bill came to my house At 8:30pm Wednesday night and told me what was wrong. Let me know the coast witch was far for the work and the part that need to be fixed. He had the parts by Friday he came and fixed the fridge in a 1:30, and cleaned up the mess. I would recommend him high. He was honest and knew what he was doing and explained a lot of this to us as he was working. I will be calling him again if there is anything else that needs a fix!!!

My roof top unit decided to fail on me during the coldest time in SoCal. Every one I called was booked at least one week out, if I got lucky enough to reach a live representative. I've decided to give Reliable a try. I called them and was offered a free same day consultation. Technician arrived and recommended replacement of the unit to which we agreed. The following day, crane was in my complex and Reliable installed a brand new unit on the roof. We could not have been happier with their service and professionalism! Thank you Reliable!</Review>

Tech John came at the time frame.
He said he has parts and can fix noise right away, price was (200$)reasonable !!
For extra 20$ he gave chemicals to remove calcium from dishwasher , and it worked great!
Thank you, I’ll recommend you my friends and family<//review>< pictures>

After dealing with this for quite some time I finally decided to have someone come take a look and boy am I glad I called these guys!

My bosch dryer has failed on me although I've tried to maintain it to the best of my abilities. I was calling across Reliable. Friendly lady answered the phone right right and went over the process. I had a technician to my home the same evening! However he did have to come back since he didn't have the replacement part in his truck. He came back the following day and finished his repairs as promised. I did not remember the name if the gentlemen but he was a taller man with euro accent of some sort. He even game me some pointers that I wasn't aware of! Thank you reliable for the amazing service and professionalism!! You have yourself a lifetime customer. Will definitely be  referring some people to you.< /Text>

My air conditioner wasn’t cooling very well and the thermostat didn’t display the correct temp. I was not about to begin the summer with no cool air so I called them and thankfully they were able to give me a new thermostat and fix the issue pretty quickly. I am so glad I won’t be suffering this summer.< /Review>

<Text>Not sure why my lengthy review didn’t post. I just read Me me review and mine is very similar. I had Reliable come out to diagnose why my Samsung dryer wasn’t working. Eddie was in my house for approximately 5-10 mins. Eddie did not take anything apart on the dryer, he opened the door, spun the drum, and looked the dryer over. He then quoted us $800 for a new mother board. The dryer cost me $899.

The reason I chose Reliable was they would come out quick, and Samsung charged about $200 for a service call vs. Reliable’s $70. I wanted a second opinion on the dryer and had Samsung come out. They charged me about $100 in 3 different parts and fixed the dryer. I called Reliable and told them what happened. The guy on the phone said their techs have a minimum of 5 years experience and they stand behind their techs. I told him since I now have a working dryer, for only $100 in parts, his tech was wrong. He again told me there was nothing else they would do and again they stand behind their tech’s diagnosis.

Like Me me, I did not do my due diligence in researching “Reliable” companies and that’s on me. When I did yesterday, seems like there are several people who have experienced the same issues that I did. Yelp and BBB have some issues, but it takes a lot to get the extremely low ratings this company has. You really need to use another company. Reliable is NOT reliable.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I hired them to diagnose and repair my Maytag washer. It worked for five loads after the repairs, then began showing the same error code. The serviceman came back promptly when it stopped working, but never returned as promised. I called daily, to no avail. In the process, I noticed they had broken the drain hose and simply zip-tied it into the hole. I called about getting it fixed, and the receptionists promised to notify the manager, but they never came. Now I simply manually open the door to reset the code. The hose repair is pending with the BBB. The servicemen were professional and quickly performed the initial repairs, so I don't know if it's just management that is refusing to follow through.< /Text></record>

gosh!! this company is  amazing!! i have used them already 4 times with today, Eddie was the technician who arrived, he was able to pinpoint  the problem, since we are returning customers we got 15% off the repairs which was great, even though it was not needed because the price was pretty cheap. i wish i could give them more than 5 stars.</Review>

I finally found a RELIABLE & honest company that didn't give me an outrageous quote. I was given a window between 8-11. The supervisor showed up around 8:30, he was polite and professional. Answered all my questions and concerns. Gave us a quote for a new unit and we had it  replaced.  Highly recommend this company :)</text>

<Text>The repairman told me that the size of refrigerator could not be replaced and I would need new kitchen cabinets if I didn’t repair it. This was a blatant lie.  A same sized new refrigerator was half the cost of his bad repair job.  I asked him to wait while I checked online.  He said “too late” I already ordered the part online.  You have to repair it.  He charged me $800 for a $33 part and 15 minutes work.  It didn’t fix it.  He came back two days later and offered to charge me $1200 for Freon.  I called the manufacturer and they said they usually provide Freon for free with a service call. I called the manager at Reliable and he said he could charge a customer anything he wants if he could get away with it. The repairman also torched my kitchen cabinets when he was adding the Freon and the refrigerator is now so loud it keeps me awake at night.

I called my bank and they’re looking into consumer fraud issues.  I would like to warn all prospective customers about this company.  The manager’s philosophy that they can con anyone they can get away with is frightening.</Text><date>1561411780759<//date>< username>

BEWARE!!!!
Our air condition goes out in 100 degree weather,  We called out a repairman from Reliable Appliance Service because of they were "Google Certified". The guy that came was not pleasant at all.  He quoted us $575 to repair the air conditioner.  Seemed a bit high.  We decided not to have him do the work,  Come to find out it was not what he said it was and we were able to get it fixed for $120, the next day.  Completely unscrupulous!!!</Review>

My oven wasn't heating to the correct temperature that was showing on the display and it was taking forever to cook things that should take less than 10 minutes. I spoke with a young woman over the phone and she set an appointment for Nelson to come see what the problem was. Lucky for me after he performed the diagnosis he went out to his vehicle and had the exact part that was needed. Short and sweet service</text>

<Review>Serge came out on to fix the dishwasher.  Wasn't spraying enough on the top rack, so replaced the arm assembly and left.  It didn't fix it ($54 parts, $150 labor) for less than :20.  Still did not work, asked him to come back and he said he couldn't figure it out and said should call someone else.  Kind of left me high and dry and still doesn't work!</Review>< pictures>

BEWARE DISHONEST
So disappointed with them. Used them in 2015 and they were fantastic, it was the technician that was. It was a Sunday, heatwave, here in a hour & Fixed unit. Same situation today. They got here quick. Elliott said after a couple of minutes and touching something to make the compressor make a noise, gave me the diagnosis that it was "No good, need new one!" $3448 estimate. Landlord was going to replace it but he wouldn't put warranty in writing. I told her we need a 2nd opinion  & She got someone else who was HONEST and REPAIRED it for $450.< /Review>

We have been using Reliable Service for a few years now and we could not be happier with the service we get each time. Their technician Bill does an amazing job with washers and dryers, as well as HVAC. He performed a few repairs for us, and each time he was able to diagnose the problem on the spot. He carried the needed parts to make it the same day repair. Needless to say, his service was professional, fast, and efficient.</Text>

When I got out of bed this morning I noticed that my fridge was leaking all over my kitchen. I've had reliable out to the house before and liked the service so it was a no brainer calling them to take a look. A guy came out told me exactly what needed to be done and the repairs were completed within a couple days. The next time anything happens I will be giving them a call!< /Review>

During this cold weather we tried using our heater, but a funny smell was coming out of the vents, we called out gas company and had them check for gas leak, they found it and told us to call a repair company. We googled for a repair company and Reliable was the first company we found. The technician was very respectful they explained to us exactly what the problem was, and was able to take care of it same day, will definitely be calling them again.<//text>

<Text>Found this company on the internet. Hands down one of the best decisions I've ever made. My 10 year old GE fridge was making a loud noise and had awful smell. I wasn't sure if it would even be repairable, the tech came out he diagnosed it and had the part on his truck. Within 3 hours my fridge was back up and running. THANK YOU RELIABLE!!!<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Have used this company in the past and called them out for my 15-year-old oven. My technician suggested I buy a new oven since the cost for repair will be close to a brand new unit. I always come back to the company because of their honesty.</Text>< rating>

The serviceman who arrived promptly within the time window given was pleasant and efficient; the problem was resolved quickly and he said that if there are problems again, he would come back for a followup. Reliable Service kept me up to date with arrival time.<//review>

<Review>Very Reliable company. I've called plenty of appliance specialist and they over charge on the service call. Reliable had a low service call and even a same day service. All others don't answer the calls, you're forced to leave a voicemail. Reliable is available 365 days and others don't even work on weekends. My experience with Reliable was great. They service all of California and I was able to refer them to my cousin out in San Jose. Rely on them!</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>I originally had "Reliable" technician out in March of this year. He returned a few months later  with a hand full of parts, but not equipped to take care of my initial problem. ($1200 worth of repairs to my stove). He took all of the burners from my Viking stove with the promise to return the following week. Several promises have been made to return with no progress in 7 months. When he cam out I at least had 3 burners that were working normally. I have now spent the entire summer with no burners.
It is now November and still cooking with pans on the Barbecue.

Definitely Not Reliable.

They are sending out a new technician this Sunday. I asked if he could at least get my good burners back from the old tech. They were unable to provide any solid answer. Will have to wait and see< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

0 Star !!!!!!  ABSOLUTELY DO NOT CALL THEM. SCAMMERS. THEY ARE LIARS AND THIEVES. They ripped off my 90 year old father. Told him a part cast 500 and I found the same exact part, a fan motor, for 60-75$. TOTAL TIME ON THE JOB 1 ½ hours plus a 75$ part cost my dad 600$ instead of maybe 200$. What a rip off.</review>

Outstanding workmanship! Tech came over to repair my Miele stove yesterday. It wasn't heating and kept making weird clicking noises. Once he showed up he immediately knew what to do. He wore shoe covers and made sure the area was kept near and clean. He was able to repair the stove on the spot with no part! Thank you!< /Review>

I have several properties throughout  california and Reliable are my go to service provider. They practically work on all brands so it makes it easy to deal with them. While their pricing is not the most competitive (hence 4 stars), they know the urgency of matter that come up with rentals. They are almost are available same day every time i need them. Im happy when my tenants are happy - Reliable helps!<//review>

<username>Aly Weaver</username><Date>1569443094534<//Date><rate>1</rate><Review>Wow after reading these reviews I have to agree with all of the one star reviews. This company is clearly only interested in collecting the 69$ service call fee. The repair man Alex showed up late, told me my washing machine motor had gone out (he came across this diagnosis with never even opening up the machine to look at the motor) He then told me the serial number  and model number did not even show up on google so ordering replacement parts was not even possible. He told me I would have to purchase a new washer. He spent a total of 10 minutes at our home (1/2 of his time was spent writing up the 69$ invoice) and offered a bogus solution. We hired another company that had the part on hand and they repaired the washer immediately at a reasonable price. DO NOT USE THEM FOR YOUR APPLIANCE SERVICE NEEDS!!! This company is a scamming people and the customer service line is a joke.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Ive always had negative experience when it came to home repair projects. Some failed to communicate delays while others never even bothered showed up. I was hesitant to call a service provider that was not familiar to me. But im glad i did! Ive called a million places in attempt to fix my microwave but no body works on them!?!? Then i called reliable. They said yes they do work on such appliance. When i scheduled the appointment, i was given a three hour window. Although the technician arrived towards the end of the appointment slot, I was impressed by his professionalism and approach. Magnesomething needed to be replaced but he did not have the part in stock. Told me 3-4 business days for it to arrive. I called on day 5 and was able to schedule repair. I guess the tech was “busy” and forgot to call me. Nevertheless, i would recommend them for appliance repair needs.</Review>

<Review>My samsung refrigerator started to leak all over my new wooden floors and i googled for help right away. Came across Reliable and decided to give them a try. They were able to come out and repair the problem the same day and provided a warranty for their work. Thankfully the floor didnt get any damage and now the refrigerator is not leaking. Highly recommend.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80d958372eeee009:0xa14f38ef7265f1a< /Gmap_id><time>1552688155138</time>< username>

<review>After some discussion over the phone with a friend of mine about why my fridge wasn't making ice we came to the conclusion to leave this up to the professionals.

My LG fridge stopped working one day of course before a huge party. My wife was stressing trying to find a company. I found Reliable on the internet and they literally showed up 30mins later to repair it. Reliable saved the day big time! Will be using them again in the future for sure.<//Review>

I don’t usually write review but my customer experience with our technician (Yuriy) was over and beyond my expectations. He was very knowledgeable, provided easy to understand resolutions, and provided feedback on cost to repair my applianaces versus what it would cost for a new appliance. That was very helpful in determining what to do next. He also gave me 30days to use the cost I paid for his visit towards the actually repair once we decide to fix it. If you call this company, make sure you ask for Yuriy. Very pleasant technician and provides great feedback to help you understand the issues with your appliance ***I’m 100% Satisfied calling them***<//Text>

<Review>I called and they said the repair man would come from 8 to 12 but he came at 7pm. Then I gave the repair man a $30 deposit to fix my refrigerator for the next day. He has not come back and it has been more than a week. I called the company asking for my deposit back but they said the deposit was nonrefundable. The technicians name was David. I've called David several times but he has not answered any of my phone calls.< /Review>< rate>

<text>Beware!!! Billed my card and preformed no service other than the initial assesssment with my tenant. I called multiple times. The follow up service was never done. I called and was told a manager would call and they never did. I disputed with my credit card company and they provided fake documentation and claimed I cancelled. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! I cannot stress enough. My tenant called another company and they actually performed the service for less than I was quoted and less than I was billed!<//text></record>

Had a service technician over on 11/20/15 to diagnose problems with my professional range. He seemed very professional and diagnosed the problems swiftly. However, I was a bit stunned when told the repairs would be $1750. As I glanced over the Invoice, I realized the numbers did not add up. I took out my calculator and found a discrepancy of over $300 in his addition. He quickly wrote up a new quote for $1418 and stated he would have the parts in plenty of time for Thanksgiving.

Realizing the urgency to get my range repaired before the holiday, I happily wrote a check for $425 to cover the required deposit. The technician stated the parts would arrive in 1-2 business days and that he would return Monday or Tuesday. I was delighted! (Note: I live in a gated community so I was able to get the technicians cell phone number to buzz him in the gate)

After waiting around all day Monday for a call to schedule the repair, I called the office. They stated that all the parts were in and that the technician would be out between 2-5pm Tuesday. Needing the repairs done before my 15 guests arrived Wednesday to celebrate the holiday, I took the day off work and waited....and waited....and waited! I finally called the technician at 6pm to find out why he had not shown up. He stated he was stuck in traffic and his GPS was indicating 2.5 hours to my home but that he would try to make it out.

Needless to say, he never made it or called me back. I promptly called the company early Wednesday morning to reschedule. They stated the technician would arrive no later than 11am. So again, I took the day off work and waited. At 1pm I became concerned when I again heard nothing from the technician so I placed several calls to his cell and the company. Finally, at about 5pm, the technician called back and stated that he had locked his keys in the car and is unable to keep the appointment. I then placed a call back to the company and was told someone would call me back when they got it figured out. About 1.5 hours later, the company called to inform me that they would have the technician out to my home the next day, THANKSGIVING, and guaranteed to get the range fixed. I was told I would be the first service call and that the technician would arrive between 8-10am.

With 15 guests at my home and no working range, I took them out to dinner and just prayed that I could catch up on Thanksgiving dinner once the repairs were done.

Thanksgiving day arrives but not the technician! After several calls, I finally reached the technician. He stated he was on his way & would arrive in 25 minutes. After waiting almost 2 hours, I again started calling when the technician was a no show. About a hour later, a supervisor called and I was told that the main part needed to repair my range, the thermostat, arrived but that the wrong part was in the box so the part would have to be reordered and the appointment would have to be rescheduled in 1-2 business days. This seemed odd because the technician was clearly driving when I spoke to him on his cell. Did he pull over to check the parts on his way?

I was left with no choice but to use the broken range to prepare my Thanksgiving dinner for 15 guests. It wasn't easy rotating everything between the one small oven that worked and the BBQ but with some stress and prayers we were able to finally enjoy our Thanksgiving dinner....at 8pm!

Its now Wednesday, December 2, and I still have not heard back from the company. I called today and demanded to speak to a supervisor. I wasn't surprised when told the supervisors aren't in, they come and go daily, but that someone would call me back within 24 hours.

I give up! Thanks Reliable Appliance Service, Inc for your completely unreliable service & dishonesty!

Next step....stop payment on my $425 deposit and call Pacific Sales!<//Text>

I wouldn’t even give 1 star if I could still leave a review. I called for an apt. And explained everything to the operator, who apparently is only an answering service and is not able to communicate issues to the technicians. A guy came out and asked what was going on. I explained water leaked out of the water despensor every time we used the sink. He asked if it was professionally installed, made a call to his manager and without even looking at the fridge to trouble shoot it, he told me to call a plumber and charged me $70 and left. Our old fridge did not have this problem with the exact same hookup. Something in the despensor is obviously the problem. It’s a brand new Samsung fridge. So we called back and I asked for a manager. Finally Paul is going to come out himself and see what’s wrong. He came and did trouble shoot to see what was wrong. He said we needed a new valve to stop the flow of water when the despensor is not in use. He said he’d call me back with the price and how long it would take to order and get back to me. A week passed with no word. So I called Again to see what’s going on. I a had to leave a message. He did call me back later with an update. I told him to go ahead and order the part and he said he’d be out in a few days to do the repair once the part came in. A few days later at the end of the week I still hadn’t heard back. So I called and left another message. I called again a day or so later. I was told he’d call back that day.  Another week passed and no word from “Reliable.”  I called again today and left a message for Paul again. He is supposed to contact Samsung and get back to me this afternoon. If you are looking for a repair company for your fridge. KEEP LOOKING! Reliable is the last name this company should have as their service is just the opposite. And the customer service is very poor. I used to work in sales and I know how to take care of people and this is NOT it! Our New fridge is still pulled out in our kitchen over a month later and still makes puddles of water on our floor. If you do call them, don’t expect to talk to anyone who cares.<//text>

<Review>This company is horrible, could care lest about satisfied consumers and are out to take the consumer financially.

They are currently charging my landlord $49.00 stating I was a "No show" when I was at home. I left my front door wide open, the technician never made any noise or rang the doorbell. Instead he attempted to reach the phone number on file for 2 minutes (not mine, but a phone number given to them previously) and when there was no answer, left and is charging the home owner $49.00.  I had rescheduled for the next morning window between 9:00-12:00 and I sat on the couch by the front door the complete time. The "technician" called at 11:45 to say he couldn't make it and informed us about the "no charge" fee for the previous day.

At this point I started to research this company and discovered numerous on-line complaints and a total of 88 with the BBB within the past 3 years. It appears they are very consistent at charging the home visit fee for various reasons without doing repairs. When they do manage to find something to repair, they overcharge or fix unnecessary repairs.

The manager is supposed to call me back within 24 hours, but from what I have read, many consumers have stated that there is no interest shown on their part to provide customer service or satisfaction. In fact, one statement on the BBB is that the same problems have occurred with this company over a significant period of time and that this reflects that they appear to choose to operate in this manner and not make necessary improvements.

Update: manager did call me back within 24 hours. He did not care or own up on the numerous complaints listed at various on-line sources and he expressed complete disregard for my concerns. At first he indicated that there were two "no show charges", one for Wednesday and one for yesterday. I informed him this was incorrect, I sat by the front door the complete waiting period and it was the tech that was a "No show". Manager stated sometimes things happen with the techs and stated I had no reason to complain about the two minute interval given on Monday for me to come to the door as the landlord had already agreed to pay the "no show", it was no cost out of my pocket, and he could not grasp my concern about this unfair charge. He showed complete disregard about the cost of 6 hours of my time spent waiting on their technician or the impact this charge had my relationship with my landlord.</Review></record>

We have been using this company since about 2016. We originally found them because they work on mielle brand, which is not something every repair company deals with (mielle is based in germany and its a whole process to get the necessary replacement parts). All of our appliances are mielle. We always wish they would just work with our home warranty company but they do not deal with 3rd parties as they require payment upon completion of repairs. That's the only downfall for them in our opinion. Reliable is our go to guys!<//text>

If I could leave MINUS 4 Stars I would. This company is a total RIP OFF! DO NOT USE THEM. They take your deposit money and then disappear. Left me without a working wash machine for over 2 weeks and wouldn’t return calls. Misdiagnosed the problem and claimed they needed to order parts! NOT!  A real appliance repair guy I called after two weeks showed up on time and fixed the problem with the drain pump in 1/2 hour. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE. They are NOT RELIABLE!!!!!!!!!!!< /Text>

This company was not reliable at all!!! They set a service day and time and was a no call no show. Then they set another day and time and arrived charging a non-refundable $70 to just look at our dishwasher. Fees not applied to any future labor. They then wrote us a fix it ticket with $400 in parts and $200 in labor. We of course refused. Lastly they suggested we go and purchase the same dishwasher only to turn around and return it with the faulty dishwasher without Best Buy’s acknowledgement. Horrible service and Horrible prices!!! Not a place I would ever recommend anyone to bring to their home.<//Text>

<text>They just take your money. I called yesterday for my dishwasher service. A guy came in without any phone call, very unprofessional, very rude, very upset and angry. Didn't explain anything and just said it cost $450, and I don't have any tools or part. I have to come back later. It was very obvious that his strategy was just come in, charge a service fee and leave. Never trust this company.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80d958372eeee009:0xa14f38ef7265f1a</GmapID></record>

<Time>1537038195196</Time><rate>1</rate><Text>More like "UN"Reliable Appliance Repair - RUN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY… This is why “Un”Reliable Appliance has LESS than a 2 STAR rating-they charge an $85 DIAGNOSTIC fee and when their tech can’t figure out what is wrong, they won’t refund it and they farm out some work to other repair people. My receipt says Local Appliance Repairmen!!! Really!!!

On Sunday morning, August 26th I woke up to find my refrigerator had stopped working. I called Reliable Appliance Repair at 6:30 AM and was told they could have someone at my house between 8 and 10 that morning. I said that’s great.

Phillip arrived at 10 and at 10:15 said he had a diagnosis and it would take 15 minutes to replace the part. He wrote up an invoice for $235.52 and waived the $85 fee and  gave me a $30 discount which is advertised on their website with the repair. So when I was told $235.52 and it would be fixed in 15 minutes, I said that’s great, let’s get it done.

Two hours later Phillip realized he misdiagnosed what was wrong with my refrigerator and said it wasn’t the part he originally thought (which he had already replaced) but in fact it was a part on the circuit board. They hav to order the part, it and it takes two days. Disappointed, I said what  go ahead and order the part. My my bill changed from $235.52 to $280.97.  Phillip asked for a partial payment of $165, which I gave him and he said he would call me on Wednesday to let me know what time he would be at my house to finish the repair.

At 3:05 PM on Wednesday, I called his office and asked them to contact him, long story short Phillip said he would be at my house at 7pm.  At 7:15 PM I tried calling Phillip and got no answer so I tried the office. I got no answer there and there wasn’t an option to leave a message.  At 7:22 Phillip texted me and said he was still at his 4-6 appointment and would come as soon as he was finished there. I asked that he please call me when he was on his way and he said he would.

At 8:20 PM I texted Phillip and asked what the status was, that he was now over an hour late in getting to my appointment. At 8:40 PM Phillip texted that he just finished the job he was at and was on his way. It will take him 20 minutes to get to my house and 20 minutes to finish the repair. After arriving and reinstalling the circuit board the refrigerator still did not work. Throughout his time at my house on Sunday and again Wednesday night, Phillip was using Google to try and figure out what the issue was. I kept asking him to call his office or another tech to get some help and he kept insisting he didn’t need any help. He suddenly put the circuit board back in place stood up grabbed his bag and said  “I think it’s the compressor” and started heading for the door. I asked him how much and he replied $800. He did not ask if I wanted the repair done or to have another tech come and verify.  He didn’t even put my refrigerator back where it belonged.

I talked to a manager the next day and was told that a refund would be given, but that she would need to talk to a supervisor above her. She called me at 4 pm Thursday afternoon and said that they would only refund $80 of the $165 that I paid. Again, I guess this is how they make their money. They send a tech that doesn’t know how to fix anything to your house and then refuses to refund the DIAGNOSTIC fee when he can’t figure it out.

Ashley, the manager said it would take 5-7 business days for my refund to go through.  Monday was a holiday so if she processed it on Friday morning I should have gotten my refund by the following Friday but that didn’t happen. I got my refund of $80 NINE days later.

Run away from this company, their techs are fresh out of diapers and they use Goggle to try and figure out the problem.  I doubt if any of them are licensed to do repair. And it wasn’t my compressor EITHER.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

In October 2017 we contacted Reliable Appliance Service in El Cajon to repair a Whirlpool washing machine. After charging us over $400 and replacing the Thrusters, the machine never worked again. We called their supervisor, Peter York, and he stated that it was our fault that the washer broke again. We must have overloaded the machine. I asked him for a refund and he basically told me to "pound sand". This is not a reputable establishment and I would strongly advise anyone not to use their services. In summary, I suspect that the technician (Leon) they sent out was not qualified to do the work. We finally junked our four year old machine and purchased a new one. JRA</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>The only positive things I can say about this company is that they showed up promptly to take advantage of my wife and the technician was friendly and competent. They advertise online that they have low prices, but beware. I reviewed the bill after the work was done and they charged $150 for a half hour of labor to fix our dryer. Seems steep, but I can deal with that since they made a service call. The bigger problem is that they charged $140 for 2 parts that MSRP for $50 on the Maytag website. I could have bought them online for $30. That's a criminal markup and is clearly intended to take advantage of trusting and uninformed consumers. I contacted the office to allow them to address this usurious overcharge. When I received a return call from the manager his only response was that my wife received a quote from the technician and could have refused the work and paid the $49 service call (the highest of any company in our area I've come to  find out). He acknowledged the MSRP and said that they can charge whatever price they want. He was unconcerned that I would write a bad review online.
CLEARLY, THIS COMPANY'S BUSINESS MODEL IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DESPERATE AND UNINFORMED CONSUMERS. STAY AWAY AND SEND A MESSAGE WITH YOUR POCKETBOOK.</Text>< userid>

<Text>DON'T USE THIS COMPANY

I wish I can put 0 starts.
We contacted the company Reliable to fix the floor heater in our property located in Long Beach on November 8th.  After the first inspection the technician David told us that the gas valve needs to be replaced and the cost is going to be $345.  We trusted him and told him to proceed.  The heater  stopped working  after a few days.  We contacted the company again and after so many phone calls the technician came back and told us that the pilot needs to be replaced. We authorized him to do job, but 2 days after he did the repairs the heater stopped working again. Then he said that we need to replace the thermostat.  We paid Reliable a total of $960 for this job.

I contacted the company again and after 3 days of waiting, finally the manager of the technician who did the repairs told me that he would inspect the heater.  The manager went the following day an mentioned to us that the heater is too old and needed to be completely replaced with a new one!  Based on this situation and because our tenants were very cold in the house we agree to replace the heater.
Two days after the manager sent technicians  to replace the heater, they arrived and realized that they brought the wrong heater. They tried to increase the price and they said that they needed to come back with a different heater.

After 3 weeks of waiting, I decided to call a different company and when this new company arrived they took pictures of the job that Reliable did. Reliable never replaced the pilot or the valve. Instead, Reliable just replaced a gas line that cost $12 in Home depot.  Also when the new company arrived to do job, there was a gas leak putting at risk the life of a family who lives there (our tenants).

Its been  a month and I have been calling Reliable almost everyday requesting an invoice, but they always make an excuse and they don't send the invoice.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Horrible service!  We called this "company" for service on 8/12/17. My washer door would not stay shut.

I was told that it would cost $69 for a technician to come to my residence which I agreed. After arriving the technician tells me that the part needed to repair the washer would need to be ordered from their warehouse at a cost of $128.99.  In addition, I would need to pay a deposit of $150 now.   I then asked for a timetable to know when the repairs would be completed. I was told the part should be in Tuesday or Wednesday (8/15 or 8/16).   We then confirmed that the technician would come back on Wednesday (8/16) to complete the repairs. Now comes Wednesday...I  adjust my work schedule to be home.  I call this "company" at 9:30 a.m. to get a time frame for the technician's arrival.  I'm told they would call me back....ok. By 11:50 a.m. I've still received no call. I call back at 12:00 p.m. wherein I'm told they would have the technician call me. When I finally speak with the technician he tells me that he was told that the part wouldn't be received from their warehouse until 8/21/17 even though I was told it would be in by 8/15 or 8/16. I explained that I shifted everything to be home today. I then receive no call at all to tell me this. I had to call three times just to be told "I'm sorry?" I've asked to speak with a Supervisor and was told one would call me back today. I was told a "Peter" would be getting back to me. 3 hours later I've received no call from "Peter". I therefore called back and was told that a "Leo" would get back to me, not Peter. Here I am still waiting for a call. Will it be Peter or Leo?  Who knows!  I explained that I cannot continue to shift my work schedule. I need this service to be completed as agreed. I've paid this "company" $150 on 8/12/17 and have received no service.  I've completely wasted a full day and am still waiting for a call...my time is too valuable to be sitting.

Side Note:  I was told they would not complete the repairs if I ordered the part from Samsung myself!

I will be writing a letter to all bureaus to inform them of this "company's" practices.< /Review><name>Ro Blk Nomad<//name>< gmapID>

Tech made it to the initial service call.  Found heater needed new coils (auxiliary heat) approx. repair would be ~$400.  Took service call down payment of ~$70 this will be applied towards the total bill.  Stated would call me back on Monday with information on parts and to setup an installation day/time.  Never heard back from him.  Called office 6 times in 3 weeks and got the same "we will have technician call you".  Of course this never happened.  On last call, I confirmed that this technician Brad J. was an employee.  Stated if he didn't call back today, I would put a stop order on the check and get another company to service the heater.

This is not a RELIABLE SERVICE company.< /Review>

Do not hire this company. They are scammers. Check their yelp page!

On 06/23/2017, my whirlpool gold refrigerator stopped working. I called Reliable Appliance Service, Inc. to fix my refrigerator. They charged me $310.00 to fix my refrigerator, the following day when we wanted to put our groceries in it, we found out it was not fixed. I called them to fix it or refund my money they refused both options. Their receipt and my broken refrigerator are both kept for evidence to back up my claim.

I am submitting my compliant to Contractor Sate License Board (1-800-321-CSLB)<//Review>

Picked this company because they offered same day service. Big mistake! Yes, the tech came at 8pm (6pm was promised) that day to diagnose the problem and order parts for overnight delivery. But it then took 48 hours and 2 visits to replace the main control board on the High End KitchenAid refrigerator (a 15 minute job, when finally done). First replacement board was the wrong model. Much food wasted! $1100 to replace a $252.88 board. High price for poor service!</Text>

Their technicians are copmpletely incompetent. Do not trust anything they say. They came to look at the spark in the microwave and told me I need to replace it. The problem ended up to be very simple and cost 30$ to repair. Their service is bad. This company is out to defraud you. DO NOT USE.< /review>

SCAM SCAM SCAM , Absolutely do not hire this company to come and check your appliance needs. I recently agreed for a technician to come out for a fee of 89 dollars. The technician came out and looked at my oven and said he needed more information to order a part and would get back to me in a few hours. A few hours later no returned calls, and im down 89 dollars. Called back the number here on this company the next day and said the tech would call me back at 2. Waited and still recieved no update or call, the people at their office would not get a hold of THEIR technician for me or give me an update or a timetable of when i can possibly expect anything. if you want to spend 89 dollars for  10 minutes of service but hours of delay and duck and dodge, then this is the company for you.</Review>

If I could give zero stars I would. This company can't be trusted. I called them out to check on 3 different appliances. When the guy was pricing it out he was fumbling around so much with the price that it seemed like he was just charging whatever he wanted. He didn't have the part for my washer so he said he would have to come back the next day and needed $100 deposit on the stuff he did fix. 3 days later he calls to say that he's just too busy with calls that he can't come back and fix the washer. Ummmmmm.....wth??? He then proceeded to say that he will just eat the cost of what i owed him for the stuff he did fix after I said that I was going to call and complain. Never experienced anything like it! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY</Review>

<text>I called this Reliable Appliance Service Co.  thinking that they stand by their name "Reliable" but the opposite is true.  They are "unrealiable".  Thei technician was at first courteous, but then when he first quote me that the parts are not availalble in California and told me and my wife that the parts-Pump Assembly, drain will cost me approximately $300.00 at first., then he retrack back and said: "around $200.00. and told me that he will call me  the following day about the parts.  Meanwhile that same evening, I google the Appliance Parts Center in National City and talked with the salesman. and ask for quote for part AP5604958 OF LG WASHER, MODEL# WT4970CW and was told that they can order this for me at a cost of $51.00. and will have it in 10 days.  So I called the Reliable  Appliance Service Co. and told them that the part is availble at that store to order.  The technician called me and told me that he will call the Appliance Parts Center, National City, but never get back with me.  Also I was told that same day by the Reliable Service Co.  that  that the techniian will be at my house between 4:00 - 6:00 Pm with the parts to fix my washer.  He never did show up nor did called us  It is sad that this Company and the technician do not communicate very well with their client/customers.  Meanwhile.  the custsomers are lelft guessing.  I was already charged $248.00 instantly  at the time of visit.  Not knowing what the actual cost of the part the company ordererd versus the $51.00 quoted by the Appliance Parts Center.  I think this is a reap offfff!  Besides, I have to asked the technician to test the washer for the proper operation when he finished the repair for he was ready to leave without testing his work.  This company is truly "unrealiable"  and not standing by their true name.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I was in a pinch and saw that I could get same day service call for a stove repair in a rental unit I own.  Big miatake.  This company practices the old bait and switch.  Website said service call is $49.95.  I was charged $69.95.  Work was done on 5/8/17.   Told me he needed to order parts, but the burners were working after a good cleaning.  Told tech I needed job done by May 10th.  Never heard back from him after many promises from Co.  And took til 5/22/17 to get an invoice which came on letterhead with a different company name, address and phone number.  Been getting nothing but the run around from phone reps of the company.  They do not call back, Tech unavailabe, manager unavilabe.  The whole gamet of excuses. Will contact Better Business Bureau for assistance.  Do not patronize this company.  You'll be sorry and spend countless phone calls with no answers.  They should be out of business. Wish I could rate lower, like minus 5.< /Text>

Oct 9th 6 pm Friday,102 degrees F.      noticed ice machine/water dispenser not working,
waiting after a busy day almost over to look thru Fridge manual & online.  by that time it was 2 am Saturday  Oct 10th
booklet did not solve the problem.  now  fridge & freezer  off as well,
lights still on, so wasn't a breaker needing a fuse.
so on line  to GE. long wait thru phone intro.finally answered politely; couldn't come for 2 WEEKS!
Sears next, after phone automated stuff; a better offer....between 1 & 5 pm... seemed like everything would be starting to melt by then.   again Saturday  100 degrees +!
next oneline local....there was this ad       24/7  REPAIRS!!
immediately a kind voice answered & booked us between 9am and 12 noon.
Eddie, very busy, called politely a bit behind, arrived about  1pm, kind, friendly, intelligent man & within minutes diagnosed  computer panel needed replacing; he had correct one;  in  less about 30 minutes, installed it working carefully.  The price for us  very reasonable.
Eddie Flores and Reliable Appliance Repair get a  large     A+     from us;  from now on theirs is the number we will call  before any for all our large electrical appliances;  we will ask for Eddie too.</Review>

I am really shocked that they are at 2 ish stars on yelp. I got this guy that came out same day, then 2 days later, on time, came back with the parts and my dryer works great. (I kind of thought I would have to get a new one.) Maybe, like many things, it depends who comes out. The guy we got was named Yuriy. He was so professional. After the last few months of dealing with really awful service personel (plumbing issues) this company was so easy to deal with. I will definately use them again.
PS tried to post to yelp but it did not want to let me :(<//text>
