$450 for a lost key replacement for a 2012 Toyota Corolla. Definitely a rip off. $179 for the key, 199 for programming, $45 to just come out, and then $39 tax. All for one key with no buttons. Definitely not worth it! Look elsewhere unless you want money stolen.<//review>

Really fast service. Showed up quickly, turned around the fix like he does it in his sleep. Ron the locksmith who arrived, great focus! when hes making the key, you can tell hes done it for years. Ron is a very friendly guy, because of his service ill get all my keys copied at LAs Best Locksmith.<//Text>

They work very well, quickly, and professionally, and they are very competent. They provided us with more details about the layout of our door frame and door, as well as an explanation of where and why the issue had arisen. I will certainly use them again in the future and would highly recommend them. For an emergency/24-hour operation, the rates aren't too bad either!</Text>

Definitely call this company if you need to push a start key or some other car key with a chip in it. It took me the entire day to deal with my missing key until I called LA Best Locksmith. One of their locksmith guys took care of it and completed the job as quickly as possible. Thank you so much for everything.</text>

Brian is absolutely amazing!! I have had 2 separate issues with locks at work on separate days. Not only did he answer right away, both times he arrived within 30 minutes. He's friendly, honest, and I feel he tries to go above and beyond to help. His prices are fair too :) *****HIGHLY RECOMMEND*****</Review>

I finally am able to leave a review for them! The worst scam I’ve ever received- I got a new car key from Ken last summer. They quoted me for a key with and without a fob and I went for without a fob since it’s what i could afford. I asked him multiple times how things were going during the process, he said good and gave no further information. When he was done, he told me he ended up programming a key with a fob because of my type of car. He never consulted me even when I asked him how things were. He then proceeds to tell me that my fees are for the key with a fob, and then the programming fee for getting the fob- the total being $200 more than he quoted! I figured out how to pay him and then he refused to give me a receipt or the writing of the initial quote and left. I have been trying to request a refund of just the overcharged amount from him through Venmo for MONTHS and I never heard back. Never use this place!<//text>

I saw how great LA Best Locksmith is so I gave them a try. And they just changed my mind about city services. My locks are intact and in their best shape and I even got me a new key from them that matches perfectly with my door lock. Thanks a bunch fellas.<//review>< pics>

They had the original key. They cut and programmed it on the spot. At the dealership, we would have had to wait for the key to arrive for two weeks. And the price would have been almost twice as much. These guys were quick, they made sure everything worked, and (most importantly) they cared. Dealerships don't.
Thank you!</text>

Well, just bought a car yesterday just to lose the key the very next day. Didn't know how to go about it. After being told to call locksmith by the delearship, i looked around online, made a couple of phone calls, LA Best were upfront about their rate and what to expect. Came within 30 minutes, since the car was a oush to start, they needed to reprogram another key. The guy did his thing and was done within 15 minutes with a brand new key. Even suggested another copy.This happened after 5pm, and really need to use the car tomorrow. Thanks man appreciate the fair price.</Text>

We lost the key to the rental car which was parked on the street, risking it being towed. Ron came out as soon as possible and made a new key. 5 star service. Very reliable & affordable. Will use again. Thanks Ron & LA Best Locksmith. Enjoy the gift! Happy New Year!</Review>

The technician was able to prepare a new key for me on spot!

<Review>I called LA Best locksmith on Friday to get a  quote to have a key made for a Volvo S 60 I was quoted $500 wow but i needed to get them and what’s the soonest I could have it done.  I was told not until Sunday because it was a big job. I asked what time on Sunday and how long it would take in my response was To please provide my phone number and that he would get back with me. about 4 PM on Sunday I rapidly jump to the conclusion that he was not going to come and the repairs on the  car woukd not be completed.  Even worse my daughter didn’t make it back to school disappointment beyond belief .  I sent an email and “NOTHING” not even a “I’m Sorry”

They Say the Highest compliment you can pay me is the referral of a friend...... I have been in the automotive industry for over 30 years (repossessions) and it would be a cold day in hell that anything nice would come out of my mouth in regards to this unprofessional so called business<//Review>< user_name>

I recently lost my car keys down a toliet and needed a new key fob for my car. I called a lot of locksmiths around Los Angeles but a lot of them didn’t have key in stock. When I called LA Best Locksmith, they helped me right away and had key in stock. LA Best Locksmith is very affordable and very nice staff. Very happy with my new key fob and will be using them in the future if something like this happens again. ❤️

My girlfriend lost her only car key for her Corolla and LA's Best Locksmith handled everything professionally and promptly. I shopped around for prices and they are by far the most cost effective! Thank you so much!<//Review>

<Review>Alon was wonderful. Not only did he charge a decent price and come in 15 minutes, but most importantly, he was able to unlock my door whereas the locksmith before him told me it was impossible and I’d need to break/change the lock (which is only months old by the way). Definitely not crossing my fingers to run into this situation again, but good to know I can call Alon when I do.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1548391080045, 'text': 'Thank you!

My third and last locksmith of the night, these guys were fair, efficient and really good at what they do. While I was given a number of options and their price points,  I felt absolutely no pressure to be up-sold into  something I didn't need.
My thanks for a job well done!<//Text>

I lost my car key and contacted LA Best locksmith. They quickly responded with the most competitive price of the 6 companies I contacted. I was told Ron would be at my place at 1PM. He arrived 15 minutes early, made me a new car key, and even included a free key to unlock my doors. I highly recommend these guys if you find yourself needing a new car key.<//text>

Alon provided a lockout service for me at 11:00 PM for a lockout on a vehicle. He was prompt and professional as he arrived within twenty minutes from placing my initial call to him for the service. He also charged me the same price that he quoted on the phone with no additional fees except the expected tax for his service. No one wants to have to call a locksmith because you already feel slightly embarrassed to be in the situation to begin with let alone having to wait for a long time to get service and there is usually always a high cost involved however I did not have any of these issues with Alon. He arrived when he said he would be there, he gave me a fair quote/estimate and charged the same price for his services after he did the work as estimated with no additional fees, he was done in five minutes with the lockout with total time spent from initial call to end of the job was less than twenty-five minutes and there was no time during the whole ordeal upon which I felt stupid or foolish for having been locked out. If I had to be locked out again then I would call Alon in a New York Minute. He is the best in Los Angeles and you will be happy you placed a call to Alon if you need a locksmith in the near future.</text>

We called late on a Sunday night and Alon came in under 30 minutes to help unlock our apartment door. The door was unlocked in just a couple of minutes, and the lock worked fine afterward! Fast, friendly, and excellent service, would definitely recommend for all your locksmiting needs.</Text>

Quick service and came late at night in under 15 minutes. He opened two locks.

We agreed to a price when he came with little hassle. Fair business. Would use again if I ever get in trouble locking myself out again.< /text>

DO NOT CALL THEM FOR ANYTHING. Save yourself from headache and find someone else who knows what their doing or the least will treat you like a professional must!!!!!!!!!!!!
I called them for my car -which the steering wheel was locked-  they sent their "technician" and told me it can definitely be fixed. I was never told that the so called technician will be breaking the entire thing and replacing with a different part that will not function properly or I would loose the Lock system entirely.

Not only that!!! he broke couple of other parts on my dash board like the AC Grill and also now the air bag light is on and I have to take my car to dealer for reprogramming.

Thats not all, when we called their management office I was treated so poorly and was accused of lying about the broken parts. The "Technician" started shouting in the middle of our driveway making a scene and threatening us to pay him and we had to call the cops for him to lower his voice.

We were charged $750.00 for a non completed job, damaged car,  and POOOOOOOR customer service. Way to go Locksmith!!!!!!!!!!!

I will for sure see these guys in court soon!</review>

I locked myself out of my house taking out the trash this morning, prior to a very busy day at work with many people waiting for and depending on me. Thank God I had my phone.  Called LA Best, and they had a very nice young man out to my home within 35 min who unlocked my door and saved the day!</Review>

<Review>Had a really tough and unfortunate situation with my jobs work van tonight. With my job on the line and the keys nowhere to be found. I found LA's Best Locksmith where me and Hanan were communicating about the situation i had. He was more than helpful and actually wanted to help me out  I tried to be as helpful as I could by opening the van and trying to get the key code from the dealer I informed him. He gave me a great price for the duplicate and reprogramming of the new key and for how late it was. then he sent his technician Ron to come out to me at my work he arrived sooner than expected and went straight to work! We got along great good person overall. We ran into some issues with the code I provided but that's my fault. So he immediately troubleshooted the problem got the right code and like music to my ears the engine turned over! (YEESSSS!) I THANKED RON right away! Thanks to Hanan and his Tech Ron, I get to keep my job and turn in the van keys to my office manager and get to go home at ease. I would recommend them anytime! They are #LABestLocksmith #SavedMyJob #TwoThumbsWayUp #CallThem
Thanks Hanan & Ron</Review>< Pictures>

<review>This company tries to rip you off! When I asked how much it costed to replace the battery for my car keys, they wanted to charge me $25. This is more expensive than Santa Monica! Then, because I desperately needed a new battery, they charged me $10 for a battery without changing it for me. The battery costs $3 at Staples by the way.</review><UserId.>115795079698094915579</UserId.>< Resp>

< Review>
Called noon on Sunday when their list said they're open until 5pm, someone answered and when I asked how much is a key copy they told me they're closed :-(

There was one person working. But he was fast with no line behind me so i was glad. He did my sandwich fine. Only gripe is no clean tables that don't have the problem of previous customers sandwich crumbs on the table.<//review>

Typical Subway they have all the typical sandwich stuff. They also have a new wrap that's 6.99 but you get 2x the meat, which is the same portion as a footlong. They brought back a few $5 footlong sandwiches but the others are overpriced. The process typically compare to a deli or specialized sandwich place but the meat quality at Subway doesn't seem as great and the veggies don't always taste fresh. Personally it's good for a quick sandwich if you like the cheaper options but otherwise I'd prefer to spend $2 more and get a quality sandwich.< /review>

Dirty place with stuff on the ground. Tables seems never cleaned between customers even on non busy times.
The sandwich was made with an old bread falling apart make you use your hands to eat it.  Very bad.<//text>

Needed a pest inspection prior to the sale of a home. Heard amazing things about California Pest Control. James came and did a very thorough inspection. On time, professional, courteous. David was then sent in to treat areas that were affected by termites. The customer service with CPC is out of this world. They know their stuff! The whole team is well educated, yet humble and helpful. They know their competition and what tactics other companies are employing that lead to failure to control the bugs and ultimately getting more money from their customers. David went above and beyond anything expected from our service with them. My family was grieving the loss of a loved one (hence the sale of the home) and the interaction with David and the team over those few days touched our hearts. They are more than a pest control company. I wish they did more services so we had excuses to hire them again. If you are looking for a group of professionals that not only have the education and skills, but are helpful and kind on EVERY a level, please give them a try. Stellar company, which is hard to find these days!!< /review>

Kyle and John were very professional and helpful with the needs of my pest control.  They both listened and took the time to give me suggestions to help prevent critters coming into my home ie…door sweeper for the garage door. I am very happy with their service and look forward to doing business with them.</Review>

Been with this company for a decade and they are really informative, honest, and consistent with their service.

We finally decided to call California Pest Control & hopped on a bi-monthly plan and we have not seen anything in months! They are also extremely professional. Dave will call to give updates and check in on problems in and around the house. I also love that they have a feature to pay online. We are going to continue service with them, I love the preventive measures and peace of mind that California Pest Control has given our family.</review><resp>None<//resp><userid>102131465286970689841<//userid><gmap_id>0x80900cbeea5b500b:0x12a3ca19bbc15052< /gmap_id>< name>

Ryan B came out to inspect our home.  I informed him that mice have invaded our home.  He said that he found mice and RAT droppings were present.... rat?? oh gross...  not what an earlier rep notified us about.  Ryan also offered to repair the outside vents to prevent the rodents from entering our home-- my husband was sold at the mention of someone else providing that service!  Happy campers here!  Thank you Ryan!<//Text>

<review>Our technician (Ryan) was very responsive to our rodent problem. He explained what was needed to be done and immediately went to task. When he came back to inspect the traps he explained what was going to happen on the next visit. When he said he would be back on a certain day and time he was there as promised.  Very professional and customer service organization. I would highly recommend Ca Pest Control to anyone with pest issues.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< user_id>

I came from a apartment complex that used CALIFORNIA PEST CONTROL. I've had different pest control companies in the past that have not been nearly as effective as this company. As most people it's embarrassing to have to admit that you have a pest problem. The I was assigned John Stevens while I was at my apartment complex. I was terrified I had bed bugs. he was very professional and understanding, he went room by room with me. I recently moved in to a house and wanted to protect myself from the previous infestation. I acquired services through California pest control. I knew right away what company to go to. I called and asked for John. he came out and immediately began a walk through with me, we came up with a plan that wold best fit my needs. we chose the every other month which is the best way to go. your covered for anything and every with just one low monthly cost. John is a very kind and gentle guy, he's very courteous and honest. he will answer all of your questions and even identify bug for you. just to have someone come into your home after being on edge because you have pest, while being treated with respect like your a old friend that John, it doesn't get any better than that. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND JOHN STEVENS, this company is great. if more people went with California pest control we could all eliminate the pest together. thank you very much John.<//Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>I had a few different companies come out for a termite problem and I was not confident in any of them so I called a friend and asked if she had a referral. That’s how I came into contact with James. He was informative, professional, and personable. I appreciated his honesty in not trying to sell me on services for pests we knew I didn’t have. The other companies all had done so, without exception. And James was the only one of them who followed up with me.
The office staff was unlike the other companies as well. They were courteous and professional. The other companies’ staff left me asking, “Why am I even dealing with these people?” It’s sad that decent customer service should be a bonus and not a standard, but I definitely got it here.
And on my treatment day Dave was just a genuinely nice man to deal with. Even my grumpy old dog appreciated his manners. I couldn’t be happier with my decision to use California Pest Control.< /text><user_id>102970212935234684407< /user_id>< Rate>

I wanted to give a rave review to the Technician that came to address the insect issues in my place. Kyle was super professional, knowledgeable and respectful.  He even wore shoe covers when he entered my place. Rarely you see pleasant technicians these days like the one from California Pest Control.</Review>

<Text>Dave was very thorough and professional. Even came half an hour before the start time. My husband and I are delighted and highly satisfied of the services offered and want to give Dave a personal thank you and recommendation. We live in an apartment complex and was greeted with nothing but professionalism and courtesy. Dave sprayed inside the apartment and outside our apartment unit. Dave was very knowledgeable and handled everything with care. I cannot recommend enough: California Pest Control is the way to go. If you're unsure, give them a call and get it done right the first time! Thank you Dave!!</Text>< Pictures>

We had a bad ant problem and it took several visits.  The owner called me personally and came to my home and did the work, so I was happy.  I wouldn't use any one else.  I have and they all sucked.  These guys are great.  Communication is fabulous.  Staff is pleasant and responsive.

Ryan was great.  He came in and did an assessment of my problem with Drain/Fruit flies. He was knowledgeable and spent some time looking for where they maybe coming from.  He explained he was unable to find an entry and that it was possible there maybe a pipe leak between the walls and it seems he was right.  Plumber will fix leaking pipe.  Thanks Ryan.  I am sure I will be calling you for Maintenance Service soon.<//text>

< Review>
These guys are like family. I love Steve and have been with this company for about 9 years now.
They are super knowledgeable, helpful, and
kind. They have the best customer service anywhere.  Having a rental with a lot of issues, they’ve always gone out of their Way to do a thorough and complete job, making sure the property Was well taken care of despite having difficult tenants to work
Around.They’ve also serviced my personal home
and take care of issues quickly and with great professionalism. I will never use another company and never recommend anyone else to my
Family and friends.You will always be with good hands with these guys and I can’t thank them
Enough for the great job they always do!<//Review>

Cal Pest Control was highly recommended and didn't disappoint .
As with all projects there are all ways unforeseen surprises. They kept me in the loop and found solutions in real time. I live in New York and needed very much a hands-on contractor. Cal Pest was that and more. I would absolutely advise anyone with pest issues hire this competent firm.<//text>

Had a bad rat problem due to a field behind my house.   Called them out within a week 5 dead.  I haven't heard or seen one since.  I called my guy when they were caught and he came right out and got them and reset the traps.   Sprayed the house and yard.  ❤👏😘<//review>

<text>I have been working with California Pest Control for many years! They do amazing work and ALWAYS stand by their word, even though there's a work order signed by all parties, they do what it takes to keep things moving forward.The best thing I love about CPC is they will look at other repair costs from other companies & compete with their bid so the sellers/buyers can afford the work to be done and we can close in a timely manner! I have to say I have never been disappointed with the work performed and how professional the all are!!

Thank you for your service!!<//text><date>1552522661254<//date><userid>102953379577752591730<//userid>< Name>

This was by far the best pest control service I've ever gotten. The treatments are very theral and are basically where you ask your treatment to be in your home. It's a little more money but differently worth it to be pest free finally!! Great company to choose👍👍<//review>

Great company! Honest, helpful, reliable and personable. My pest control guy, Steve, gives me a call/text the day before he is going to come to remind me to keep my backyard gate unlocked so he has access to spray. He also asks if there are any pest problems that may need some extra attention. Steve is always friendly and professional. I believe in supporting small local business.<//Text>

I will recommend all the home sellers and real estate agents to do termite pre-inspection, so you know if there is any problem and fix it with your own contractor prior put the house on market.  As most of the lenders will ask for section one clearance certificate prior funding, you don 't want to wait until last min. I have done several termite inspections through James, his very knowledge and professional and know what's his doing and give good advice how to take care the problems found.<//text>

We had ants in our home for years. Sometimes we would wake up to trails with thousands of ants. There was no way we could leave any food on the counter, or in the pantry unless in was sealed shut. I finally called California Pest Control. They are very good at what they do. Immediately our ant problem was over. It has been over a year since I've seen even one ant in our home. Let them rid you of your pest problem for good.< /Review>

I hired California Pest Control for my own home and Steve did an awesome job! I had a bad problem with roaches. Reliable, retuned calls and responded to all concerns promptly.
I had previously used another company and was so disappointed. It seemed as though the roaches multiplied after their visit.
The very first time Steve from California Pest Control treated, the problem was taken care of the first time.
Haven’t had any roaches since!
I will never use any one else! I have also used them for my rentals because there was a bedbug problem there, it was scheduled and they an awesome job removing every trace of bedbugs!
EXCELLENT SERVICE *****< /Review>

I have dealt with California Pest Control, Inc. twice now and I. will use them again. They are always very thorough and available for me, even with short notice! Very professional across the board.

<Time>1553824921058</Time><user_name>Heather< /user_name><text>They were excellent! Greg, the owner, came out and assessed the problem and John came out twice, two weeks apart and got rid of the problem. They were both very professional. John was thorough and did an amazing job! We've lived in the same home for 15 years and never had any pest control issues. It's been almost 7 months since they came out and we've not seen one "uninvited" guest. Pest control is one of those services you never want to use, but if we ever needed to again, we would call California Pest Control without a doubt. I highly recommend them!< /text>< rate>

<Text>their service works. before i moved into my house i had these big nasty roaches in my garage. some smaller ones was in my house. plus i had spiders. after using CPC for couple of months, i say after the 2nd and 3rd time, the presence of bugs diminished! great job. only downside, is price, and sometimes they are difficult to get a hold off via email, but they do respond when you call. i like how they allow online payments too via paypal, very convenient for me.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Name>

Heather Peralta provided me amazing service in a difficult situation after our home insurer dropped us. Much of the work had to be done while I was on vacation with little phone access and Heather bent over backwards to make sure our needs were met and no lapse in insurance occurred. So grateful to Heather for her service, clarity, and patience!< /review>

Ken is the best! Super friendly and knowledgeable. He helped me sift through my options and explained in detail to me so that I would understand what would be best for my situation. I really appreciate his help. Glad I found him!</Text>

<text>I had the most amazing experience with the Blackwell Insurance Agency, and specifically Jennifer.  She was kind (even when I had to cancel my policy), professional, honest and very knowledgable about everything insurance.  They truly care about treating their customers with integrity and respect.  Highly recommend you try them.< /text><rating>5<//rating><userid>103176102543968861652<//userid><Date>1628543181533< /Date><pics>None<//pics><Name>Jakki Braden< /Name>< Resp>

<text>Ken provided 3 quotes on 2 properties the same day. Our present broker has had the info for a week and still no quote. Ken was very knowledgeable in determining what we needed and provided additional important information regarding our present umbrella policy. No question that they are looking out for your best interest and will provide excellent service.</text>< Pics>

<review>I am so happy to have found Blackwell.  They are doing a fantastic job.  I was searching for an umbrella insurance policy since July, 7 months ago from my insurer which I have been with for over 30 years.  I was eventually declined.  I found Blackwell online that was endorsed by Dave Ramsey. I contacted them, and a policy at competitive pricing was issued in 24 hours.  Thank you, Heather and Blackwell.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Jennifer Gunderson was absolutely amazing! She went out of her way to find us homeowners insurance and car insurance coverage that were both affordable and very reasonable. She followed up about questions I had about the policy and was very professional the entire time. I would highly recommend Jennifer to anyone looking for a reliable and trustworthy person.</Review>

< Review>
I highly recommend Blackwell Insurance and specifically, Jenn Gunderson even though I eventually ended up canceling my policy.  Jenn did her best to shop my auto/home policy to find the best possible rates given recent claims with the insurance carrier.  She was also very professional and thorough during cancelation.  I ended up obtaining insurance through my employer benefit portal, a perk I did not know was available to me.  Absent this benefit, I would have remained a client of Blackwell and appreciate the service I received for the past years.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I felt that I now have an advocate that will help me navigate through any (hopefully never) future claims. Ken was amazing in outlining what Blackwell Insurance do, how they help their clients and how they can tailor the right package for me. Ken answered all my questions, explaining the pros and cons of each decision that was made along the way. Ken always met me on my schedule, and was pleasant to deal with on the phone. One of tenets of Blackwell Insurance Agency is "We want to keep you as a client for life" and - this certainly shows with the level of time Ken put into my account.< /Text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Finding home insurance in a fire / brush area in SoCal that does not break the bank is next to impossible on your own. Ken was able to offer a policy  - which integrated a "FAIR" plan - that was not only priced lower than anything I could find on my own, but with coverage that was increased and optimized to be appropriate for my current living / financial status. I will be referring Ken to all of my neighbors - which is the best testament I could possibly give to Ken and his high quality of service. The other 5-star reviews here are spot-on, BTW.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>I was having a hard time getting umbrella insurance. My current agency  which I have been a customer for over 30 years, took 7 months since first requested, and I was declined.  I was so disappointed.  I finally went online and looked.   Blackwell was a local recommendation by Dave Ramsey. It was really easy. Heather of Blackwell called me the day after my request online.  Everything was done quickly and efficiently.  I was enrolled within 24 hours since talking to them.  Thanks Heather and Blackwell.  I am a fan now.<//review>< Pics>

Ken was awesome! No hassles and very efficient with finding the right policy for my 1894 historical home! YTM Ken! Thanks so much for making me a priority today.

I’ve been working with Leigh for several years and have multiple home insurance policies with Blackwell. Each experience has been a unique one but what’s remained consistent is the quick responses and willingness to explain everything in detail.

Recently I needed help filing a claim against a neighbor for damages caused by trees and Leigh and Jennifer Hanson have gone out of their way, in my opinion, to help me accomplish that. I get the feeling that they are genuinely interested in how the claim is progressing and are eager to help me through it in any way that they can. I’m grateful for their help and guidance.<//text>

<Text>I just started an LLC and really did not have a clue on what type of insurance coverage I needed.  I filled out an information request form on the Blackwell Insurance website.  The following day I was contacted by Jennifer Hanson, an agent with Blackwell Insurance.  Jennifer answered all the questions I had and based on my needs, was able to give me a couple of insurance options.  Jennifer was a pleasure to speak with and would highly recommend Jennifer and Blackwell Insurance for any Insurance needs.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Jenn Gunderson is just amazing at Blackwell Insurance Agency. Highly recommend her and Blackwell !  Jenn did all the research and got me the best price and coverage for my homeowners insurance, earthquake insurance, and even improved my current auto policy. Jenn got me the best deal for my needs, and so on top of it as well. Can't recommend her and Blackwell more highly. Go to them for all your insurance needs.</text>

got me the best deal on car insurance saved over $300 annually compared to AAA Auto Club.Ken didn't feel threatened at all to meet in person and did business with an old fashioned hand shake once deal was done. Nice office off the 405 freeway exit Lake Forest Drive and pleasant demeanour . Ken knows what he's doing and excellent customer service.
I would recommend Blackwell Insurance to anyone looking for an agent that looks out for your best interest. Thanks again Ken and Blackwell Insurance< /review>

<Text>I was able to secure an Homeowners insurance policy in 1 day. My previous agent had apologized "for falling so behind". Our previous agent didn't offer any alternatives, including shopping carriers after expressing our concern with the 30% increase in premium. Blackwell jumped all over it and came through quickly.< /Text><time>1599685033851</time></record>

< review>
My recent insurance company cancelled my policy because my home is in a high fire zone. After 20 years and not a single claim, they just outright dropped me and everybody else in my neighborhood who had them. I had Blackwell Insurance a long time ago when I lived in California for my vehicles and home insurance. Unfortunately I moved to Utah which requires completely different insurance policies which have to be insured through of Utah insurance carriers.

So after this abrupt cancellation I made a quick call and spoke with Ken at Blackwell insurance. He was extremely professional and understood my needs immediately. He quickly looked up my property asked a few questions and would call me back with what he could find. Ken called back quickly with a fantastic rate considering the home is in a high fire zone. It was only $100 more and got better coverage than I had. Thanks for all your foot work and your quick response Ken,  now I can focus on more important things.<//review>

<review>Blackwell Insurance has been my agent for over 10 years and I’ve always had an excellent experience with them. They don’t stop at selling you a policy. When up for renewal they check if the premium is correct and will even notify you when a policy payment is due. That has helped me on a number of occasions when I was either away from home or just glossed it over. Ken helped with a referral recently saving that person a significant amount of money that another agent completely missed. Thanks Ken & Blackwell!< /review>< Pictures>

My agent Kenneth Haraughty has been extremely professional and efficient in providing my insurance needs. I originally contacted Ken in a bit of a  stupor in July, Ken was so knowledgeable in all areas of insurance that I've decided to obtain a multi policy that is more affordable than I could have ever imagined. Over the course of the 5 months Ken stayed in contact and called to check in on every date he said he would. He works hard and builds confidence and trust in his clients. I would not hesitate to recommend Ken or Blackwell insurance they have been a blessing. Thank you Ken for all the effort you put into making sure I'm covered.</text>

<text>I’m a very demanding customer and have very high service expectations. Blackwell has been the best insurance agent I’ve ever worked with — from finding the most effective insurance policy, dealing with incidents, and following up/checking in for new deals/discounts. I’ve now moved both my homeowners and auto insurance with Blackwell — and highly recommend them to anyone that expects quality service and likes working with good/trustworthy people.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Ken wrote up our policies with the same company we have been with for years, but with better coverage and lower costs on our auto and home insurance. He is very responsive and gets the job done quickly.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dce860e0d4440f:0x7088ff4797237165</Gmap_id><userid>115588448916691095099< /userid><rating>5</rating>< pics>

<Text>I share the five star rating of all the other reviews for Blackwell Insurance Agency. We have been long time customers and I have never  (in my lifetime)  received such incredible customer service. This includes any financial institution and for that matter any business in  the Western World and beyond. Lee Blackwell excels at articulating concepts as does Maria . They are truly a customer driven organization and I would highly recommend them for any insurance needs. Entire staff responds with "speed of light" alacrity - extremely professional - and some seriously nice people. Thank you, Blackwell Insurance. You have consistently exceeded all expectations.

I have been with Blackwell Insurance Agency now for more than ten years; and I have to say that I could not get better rates, more personable service and peace of mind anywhere other than at Blackwell. I am so grateful for this awesome team! Especially, Leigh, Jennifer, Maria and the friendliest receptionist that is always very helpful. I look forward to many more years with #Blackwell and recommend to all my family and friends.< /Review>

<Text>Where do i begin. Was having a pretty stressful day at work and with the thought of having to also find car insurance, i wasnt looking forward to an extra expense. I thank the universe for having come across Blackwell insurance agency, specifically across Ken Haraughty. Ken was so patient and helpful throughout the whole interaction. He removed the stress I had searching for insurance, but also quoted and signed me up with an amazing rate ! 180$ for a vehicle is unheard of! Thank you Ken for providing amazing help and being there for me! Highly Recommend, ask for Ken Haraughty!</Text><user_name>Emmanuel De La Rosa</user_name><UserId.>118069590628003758912< /UserId.></record>

I was with Blackwell for over 14 years and made a huge mistake by switching to AAA for a year. I’m happy to say that as of yesterday I’m back with the Blackwell family!!! My agent went above and beyond, literally. I was having issues being able to renew my insurance due to financial issues over the Christmas holiday and he kept in touch with me during his time away from work. Always treated like a family member, especially during hard times. I’m happy to be back!!!!</Text>

Love this agency!!

Ken was a tremendous help to my newly licensed child with her auto insurance challenges. He provided  options, without overwhelming her, and then patiently explained the differences with each policy. He offered suggestions, something our former agent failed to do, that saved us some premium dollars! Thanks Ken, you're a true professional!

I recently got into a car accident and my agent helped me with the claim adjustments was reimbursements and assisted me with what I needed to close this claim. Jennifer Gunderson provided over and over again amazing  and exceptional service.  She is dedicated, assisted me after hours while she was at home attending to her family. I wouldn’t go anywhere else, they have my auto home apartments and an umbrella policy. I highly recommend this agency I have dealt in the past with the owner Judy who has always kept her promise and fulfilled my needs first.

Look no further than Ken at Blackwell Insurance for whatever insurance you need! I first came to him with help for renter's insurance, and ended up coming back a few weeks later to also switch my car insurance over. He provided excellent customer service, answered all of my questions and was a joy to work with.<//Review>

<date>1570252967679</date><Text>Ken gets another attaboy.  Consolidated, for the first time, all four real estate and two vehicle insurances last year at an agency one and a half hours from me.  They did a good job; but this year I requested that I come to their office to discuss several aspects of the policies.  "Sorry we do all our work via phone."  Well sorry, I prefer one-on-one exchanges.

After about an hour and a half I walked out of Ken's office a happy customer and only drove 6 minutes to get there.  Ken and I worked the details together.  As thorough as Ken was, I bet next year he will be able to save me some $$$$$s.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
WOW! Jennifer is amazing and the agency overall is the best I found in Foothill Ranch / Lake Forest area. I have been calling local agents and doing online quote requests for sometime and getting a run around or no response. By chance I found the Blackwell Agency and emailed them. Jennifer responded and quickly obtained information on my needs and spent a few hours searching for the right policy for my situation. ( home butts up against an area know as a high fire danger zone)
In the end she got me locked in with a great policy for my home owner policy , earthquake and flood policies at costs well below what I was paying. I was so happy with her attention to details that I moved my auto and umbrella policies over as well after being with another company for 46 years . She saved me several hundred dollars there for the same or better coverage.  I would highly recommend the Blackwell Insurance Agency and Jennifer who is one of the agents there.<//Review>

Blackwell Insurance has been a tremendous help for me and my wife and I would recommend to anyone. The staff are very personable and easy to work with. They also work with many insurance companies in SoCal so they have your best interest in mind when working with you. 10/10!<//review>

We worked with Jennifer at Blackwell Insurance to completely update our insurance plans.  She is extremely knowledgeable and efficient.  She answered all of our questions and provided us with several options.  We are very pleased and have already referred our family members to Blackwell Insurance.< /Review>

I have used Blackwell Insurance for about 40 years. They have handled our vehicle insurance for 40 all those years and for about the past 10 they have been handling my home owners insurance. They have always been there for me with all of my questions. Even though they are about 50 miles from me, and I have only been there 1 time, they have been like family. I would highly recommend them.< /review>

It was great.  The best cleaning I ever had and she didn't tell me I needed new front teeth just because the back is now metal.   And at this time I don't need front teeth.  I  need the back molar fixed.  Thank you.  Enjoyed the experience.<//Review>

< Review>
Dr. Johnson and the staff are amazing. They went out of their way to make me feel comfortable after having a bad experience in the past with another dentist. Katie was truly the best and went above and beyond to help me. If you’re anxious or scared of the dentist like I am, you definitely want to give them a call. You will not regret it!<//Review>

< review>
Dr. Johnson has real integrity. My bite guard was not fitting properly. I fully expected to be spending $400 to $500 for a new one. Dr. Johnson thought it could be repaired, so he tried a few places before finding one that could. My repaired guard fits and works perfectly. Dr. Johnson went the extra mile - saving me money and probably costing himself some. The staff are friendly and professional. A great first experience.</review>

Amazing experience! Jen was super friendly, talkative, and gave the best teeth cleaning I’ve experienced, hands down. Dr. Johnson came in after and assessed my teeth as well and made you feel comfortable and right at home. Cookie and gift bag to boot! Thanks, team- super glad to have found an awesome dentist in Chico!< /review>

Beautiful, clean and friendly dental practice. They were very accommodating with working me into their schedule last minute. Hygienist Jen was fantastic! Thorough with her exam and cleaning, and also focused on my having a comfortable experience. Dr. Johnson has a light & fun personality along with a confidence-instilling bedside manner. Overall great experience. Thank you so much for providing an exceptional dental experience. I will definitely be recommending their office to others!<//text>

<review>I had a great experience as a patient at Dr. Gary Johnson DDS. The front office staff is very friendly and helpful making sure that I had the paperwork I needed in advance to update my file. The hygienist took my temperature, prior to entering the office. She went the extra mile by taking my blood pressure and asked me specific questions about my health.

Dr. Johnson and the dental hygienist talked with me about a plan for future dental care. I do know that Dr. Johnson's office offers whitening services, cosmetic dentistry and more. I highly recommend their services.< /review>< Pics>

The staff at Dr. Johnson’s is amazing. Everyone is warm and welcoming from the moment you walk in. Courtney is the best dental hygienist that I’ve ever been to in my entire life! She’s very diligent and yet incredibly gentle. I can’t say enough good things about this dental practice.<//review>

Dr. Johnson is great. Very kind and he did a great job on the work I had done there. Great staff. The hygienists are knowledgeable, informative and respectful of my choices in what to do with my teeth. I feel like they really have my best interest in mind. The receptionists are sweet and helpful as well. Thanks for all the swag!<//Review>

I called this morning for an emergency visit, I'm new to the area and had not seen a dentist yet. They got me in within an hour, and the staff as well as Dr. Johnson are the nicest and most professional I've ever dealt with at a dental office. I had the emergency because I don't go to the dentist regularly due to prior negative experiences. That will change now, I even made a regular visit appointment because I actually want to go back. The great reviews I saw before calling them are well earned. Thank you Dr Johnson, Tianna and the wonderful lady at the front desk for taking excellent care of me 😊</text>

<Text>Great experience as always. Been going here for years, even when it was Dr. Walker. Feel like family when I walk in. Have known some of the support staff and hygienists for probably 15 years. Equipment is always top notch and cutting edge. And the chapstick they give out, forget about it!!  Anyone who goes here knows about the chapstick. If you’re looking for a new dentist, check them out!!</Text><rate>5< /rate></record>

Lots of bells and whistles and up-selling.  I’d give the office a pass.  State of the art clearly but you’ll pay for it, perhaps unnecessarily.</Text>

I never thought I would ever like a dentist (or their office staff!), however, I must say I love this one! Not necessary the dentist, as the person, but the dentist, as their profession!  The staff, at Dr. Johnson's office treat you like family. They go out of their way  to make sure you are comfortable and help with any insurance questions you may have. This has been one of the best choices I've ever made! I give Dr. Gary Johnson and his staff an 11!!</Review>

Dr. Johnson and his staff are simply the very best! They are very professional, very knowledgeable, very courteous, very friendly, very technologically advanced.  Somebody needs to figure out a way to clone my hygienist, Courtney.  She’s amazing!

Over the years I’ve had a number of dentists.  But I’ve never been more satisfied with any dental office than this one. I highly recommend Dr. Gary Johnson and his fantastic staff!<//review>

Very professional office everyone is enjoying their work and takes real pride in a happy patient.  That is not an easy task when you are talking about a dental office. They go the extra effort to make sure you are comfortable and more than just satisfied with your experience. I have been a patient for many years and will continue.

I had a tooth that broke and needed a crown. Dr. Johnsons staff got me scheduled right away. The appointment lasted 1 1/2 hours and I had the permanent crown in and out the door i went.  He has the newest technology to do all the work at house office! Staff was great as well.<//review>

The friendly & efficient staff were very helpful.  Dr. Johnson replaced several old silver fillings with new white ones.  They look great.  I experienced minor discomfort & no pain throughout the procedure.</text>

I had the most wonderful experience at the free Dental day. It’s such an amazing thing the entire office puts on for the community. I had a cleaning with Debbie who was so gentle and took the time to actually show me how to floss and brush better and get into the tight spaces where I needed it most. I will definitely be coming back as a regular patient.< /review>

Being most thorough, and using state of the art equipment, I am confident that their work is only the best.  The hygienist was gentle, showing concern for comfort throughout my appointment, a welcome gift packaged nicely, and Keurig assorted coffees if you like. Beautiful, spotlessly clean office. Highly recommend.      New Patient, Christine Palmer< /text>

I have had check ups, teeth cleaning, fillings, extraction and a root canal, I have yet to have a bad experience. All the staff is very friendly and I have never had a wait that felt excessive, usually less then 10 minutes. If you are like me and dont like the dentist, Gary Johnson's is the place to go.

It was a very good experience, as usual. Danielle is my hygienist and she is perfect. She did a great job. I enjoy her personality. I am very happy with everyone who works there. They are all a "top notch" team. I really dislike going to the dentist but they make it comfortable and bearable for me. Thank you for all of you!</Text>

My search for a worthy dentist has finally ended!  I highly recommend Dr. Johnson and his amazing staff.  They are personable, charming and most importantly, talented.  During my visit while I was getting my cavities filled I was treated to a calming view of a redwood grove out the window.  The hygienist offered me a pair of nice headphones so I could listen to music to soothe the experience.

The office was halfway through a beautiful remodel, and I am looking forward to going back to the dentist for once to see the rest of the of amenities.</Review>

This is the most exceptional dentist and staff I have ever met.  For them, it is all about the patient.  They put the patient, their concerns and comfort first. Upon assessment of your situation, you are given options for treatment, as well as the cost, so you can make an informed choice. The degree of caring and compassion by each member of the team, and Dr. Johnson, is extraordinary.  I have a long history of negative dental experiences.  I can honestly say Dr. Johnson and his staff do everything they can to ensure a positive experience.  I am very, very thankful to have found them and will never go anywhere else.  They are simply, the BEST!< /Review>

Debbie made my teeth cleaning and exam so easy and pleasant. My teeth are somewhat unusual and she was so supportive with her advise on how to care for them. Debbie is clearly facile, skilled, and experienced in hygienic tooth care. Thank you so very much. My teeth and gums feel great!< /Text>

I went there to have some fillings replaced and chipped teeth fixed. They were extreme professional, fairly priced and did an amazing job on my teeth. They could have easily tried to upsell me on veneers but instead we went with the much cheaper filling option and I love them! You won’t be disappointed if you go there!< /text>

<text>I went there to have some fillings replaced and chipped teeth fixed. They were extreme professional, fairly priced and did an amazing job on my teeth. They could have easily tried to upsell me on veneers but instead we went with the much cheaper filling option and I love them! You won’t be disappointed if you go there!< /text>< Pictures>

I love this practice!! I have not had a good experience with dentists growing up, always rough and painful.  But the hygienists at Dr. Johnson’s office are great (Courtney and Jen).  They are gentle and I love how they explain everything so well.  They truly help me understand how to take care of my teeth better.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a dentist in Chico.

Update:  Still love this place.  I had Beth for a hygienist today and she was awesome! Very friendly and conversational.  Dr. Johnson also took time with me to talk about my TMJ and his thoughts on treatments.  Always a good experience here!< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Took my 6 year old daughter in for her first REAL dentist appointment - a few fillings. I was a bit nervous for her as she has never had any dental work done other than a cleaning. Dr. Johnson and his assistant were SO good with her. He relates very well to children and can keep an engaging conversation going with a 6 year old which was fantastic. They described everything in very simple, fun kid terms so there were no surprises for my daughter, yet they kept it fun so she had nothing to be afraid of.

My daughter didn't even flinch once through everything they did. Dr. Johnson was very gentle, quick, yet thorough. He also communicated very well with me about everything they were doing. I can't say enough good things about the experience. Great office.

I have also been in for my own regular dental hygiene appointment and Courtney was great. Very detail-oriented and focused on my comfort throughout the entire appointment.<//Text>< pictures>

He was very thorough in explaining what the situation was and treatment options. He was professional while being very personable. His office staff was very friendly and the reception area relaxing. I would highly recommend Dr. Johnson.< /review><rate>5</rate>< date>

Dr Johnson and his entire staff are great.  They squeezed me in for a quick exam of my damaged crown but I felt very comfortable and cared for. Dr.  Johnson is very reasonable in his advice and does not replace things unless truly needed. And when a crown is needed, he can do it in one appointment!<//text>

Honestly I felt nervous cause its been awhile since I last went in to a dental area. But they made me feel very welcomed, treated me with genuine kindness, not a fake smile nor a fake politeness.From the Dr. to the secretary they  are so nice. They answered all my questions, they went through the steps so I could understand the procedure. I'm now so excited to be in a journey with them as a client! I will def recommend others to go there. No regrets at all!</Review>

When a lower front veneer crumbled in my dessert and left me looking like a jack-o-lantern just a few days before a long weekend trip out of town, I was thinking I'd be dealing with an awkward looking temporary replacement at best. When I called the office, they quickly got me in and I was amazed at the technology Dr. Johnson has. As he waved his magic click-y wand over the gaping hole in my smile, I saw the outline of my new permanent veneer being formed on the computer. The process only took a couple of hours (no impressions, no temporaries) and I walked out of the office a happy camper.</text>

I went there for the first time today (which was also my birthday). They took amazing care of me and made going to the dentist on my birthday not so bad! Dr. Johnson was even able to get a stain off of my teeth that has been there since high school (first dentist out of three that has been able to remove this stain for me). I couldn’t be happier with the service there!!! 😁< /Text>

<Text>I had a hole in an old crown and it was starting to hurt so Katie got me in right away to see Dr. Johnson. I am going to need a new crown but thank goodness they make the crown in their office so my downtime is minimal and I DO NOT have to wait weeks wearing a temporary crown while it is made offsite.

The staff is wonderful and I look forward to my next cleaning so I can try to make Courtney laugh. They keep my cleanings right on schedule which I appreciate.

The next item will be to have whitening trays made to keep my pearly whites bright!</Text>< Pictures>

The staff are friendly and genuinely care about your oral health. I have fairly crowded teeth and a “V” arch that can make a hygenist’s job pretty tough. The hygienist that cleaned my teeth did an excellent job with both the cleaning and flossing. Not once was I in pain. I’d gladly recommend them to anyone.< /review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I couldn’t be happier with the service I receive at Gary Johnson, DDS. The staff is helpful and friendly, the technicians and hygienists are really good and knowledgeable, and Dr Johnson is gentle and nice. I’ve been seeing Dr Johnson for at least 4 years and have been to him for everything from regular cleaning, fixing a broken implant, fillings, and even Invisalign. Most of the time I have not had dental insurance and found the cost quite reasonable as well.< /Review>< pics>

Hands down the best dentist I’ve ever been to! I think we know that no one really enjoys trips to the dentist, but this team makes it as pleasant as possible. Very professional and polite (and the free cookies don’t hurt either!)</review>

My first visit and was warmly welcomed by everyone I talked with.  Received a tour of the office and a peek at some of their state of the art technology.  They had my records from my prior dentist and was ready to go to work.  Had a cleaning by a very thorough and knowledgable hygenist.  Highly recommend!< /Text>

Great experience with Gary Johnson DDS and his entire staff.  Dr. Johnson continues the excellent service and professionalism that I received for the last 30 years from Dr.Gary Walker.  Very pleased.
Seamless transition and just as great an experience.  If you have to go to the dentist (and you should) then this is a great place to accomplish that.</review>

I'm a huge fan of Gary Johnson's office! They have a friendly, professional staff, and are amazing with children and adults alike. I recently went in for my first cleaning/exam since we moved to Chico, and I took all three of my kids there as well (ages 8, 6 and 4). It was a positive experience for all of us. My youngest son surprised us with a couple cavities that needed to be filled. I was a bit apprehensive about how he would do during this procedure at such a young age. Dr. Johnson and his staff were unbelievable - they explained each tool and what it would do in such a way that it instantly put my son at ease. He didn't cry or display any feelings of anxiety at any point during the procedure. I would highly recommend Dr. Johnson's office to anyone...especially if you like warm cookies while you wait. ;-)</text>

<Text>Ive only had a consult so far,  but I really liked everyone from the front office staff to the dental hygienist to Dr. Johnson himself. His main concern was definitely making sure that I was comfortable for my upcoming appointments as I have a very deep fear of dentistry! Additionally, he understood that finances were tight for me so he told me that there were plenty of things I could hold off on until  either I had the money or they became painful. Any dentist that is focused on me and my comfort is a good one! And I’ve been to a lot of dentists before.  My dad even picked up a packet to become a patient himself. I would definitely recommend Dr. Johnson’s office.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Response>

<Review>I've been going to this office for all my dental needs for 12 years. These folks will treat you well, they care about you, and they know their stuff. HHere'san example: Ihad to get 2 shots today, and sure I started sweating when the needle came out, but they did the shots so I couldn't feel either one of them. That's real customer service if you ask me. Oh, and they have fresh cookies too, but I always feel to guilty to eat one right after a cleaning.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The staff at Gary Johnson, DDS was absolutely amazing. I had a really difficult extraction and they were more than caring and professional. They talked me through the whole process. Made several calls to check on me after the process to make sure that I was healing comfortably and efficiently. I would recommend this dentist office to anyone who has had difficult dental experiences in the past and might be hesitant to go back. Really beautiful office with really beautiful staff. Thank you.</text>

Although, ever since I started going to Dr. Gary Johnson it has been a positive experience, and my teeth have never looked better. I recently fractured a tooth from an old root canal, which was the most pain that I have ever experienced. Dr. Johnson was able to fit me in quickly and extract the tooth. Dr. Johnson is the only person in the world that can make a tooth extraction a pleasant experience. He also contacted me the next day to make sure I was doing okay. He and his staff is the best dental office in the world. They are amazing!<//Text><GmapID>0x8082d87020b81ad1:0x78d58778a6cba754</GmapID>< rating>

I like dr. Johnson’s office. I’ve gone from really dreading the dentist to being alright with it. I don’t think you ever really like going to the dentist but this place has been the best I’ve ever been to.

I’ve seen a lot of dentist In my life and a lot of them seem like they find work to do in order to make money, whether it’s necessary or not. Dr Johnson hasn’t done that to me.

The staff is awesome, and dr Johnson is a good dentist. I have, and will recommend dr. Johnson and his staff.<//text>

I like dr. Johnson’s office. I’ve gone from really dreading the dentist to being alright with it. I don’t think you ever really like going to the dentist but this place has been the best I’ve ever been to.

I’ve seen a lot of dentist In my life and a lot of them seem like they find work to do in order to make money, whether it’s necessary or not. Dr Johnson hasn’t done that to me.

The staff is awesome, and dr Johnson is a good dentist. I have, and will recommend dr. Johnson and his staff.</text>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>I just feel so fortunate to be in this office. I haven't had any dental work in Chico since we moved here 13 years ago. I drove back to Santa Rosa to do any work  that I needed done. I didn't trust anybody except my old dentist. But from the very beginning I felt Dr. Johnson was very capable and I felt completely confident in his abilities. I was so very afraid to have this procedure done, as it was somethingI had not had to do since I was a teenager. However, Dr. Johnson and his assistant Jenise made me feel more than comfortable and assured that I was in the best hands possible. The entire procedure went quickly and without any discomfort. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this office. Dr. Johnson and his entire team are superior professionals . They truly care about their patient's comfort and dental health.</Text>< gmapID>

Have not once had an issue,  plus my teeth have never been in as nice as they are now.  They don't just clean,  they have a great cosmetic touch that makes you feel a lot better about your mouth.<//text>

To start as you come in, the staff is amazing!
Very friendly and upbeat.
The hygienic team are fun and engaging.
I only met Dr. Jahani today but he was very cool and IMMEDIATELY figured out and repaired a problem that i have had for about one year.
Great Job

Dr. Jahani did an amazing job with matching and replacing a chipped veneer. He was so calming and professional and took a lot of time explaining all of my options and the procedures to me. He took the time to administer the numbing medicine himself and it was completely pain free!! I am also impressed with all of the office and other professional staff. I love this practice!< /review>

Thank you Dr Ali Jahani and his staff for providing the best treatment. Super knowledgeable Doctor Jahani had better eyes that the x-ray picture had, he found issues that I had for many years and no other doctor ever point it, I am looking forward for my next visit and take care of my teeth. I also like to thank his staff for being super professional, friendly and take time to answer all my questions, they were not rushing me out of the chair :). I was also impressed with state of equipment and super clean office. thank you</review>

<text>I've been coming to Arcadia Dentistry for quite some time under the care of Dr. Jacobsen and his staff, and they were marvelous. There has been some changes and now Dr. Jahani has taken over. I'm usually nervous about new Dentists as I'm not quite sure how they are, but they have made an impressive transition. Dr. Jahani is incredibly nice and gentle when it comes to taking care of your teeth!

From the front desk to the care team, his staff is top-notch customer service oriented and they absolutely care and getting to know their patients. From my experience, the dental hygienist found a crack in my tooth during a routine check (she's quite funny too!). Dr. Jahani seamlessly took care of the crack and filled it painlessly. I don't live in the area anymore, but I will still make the long commute back to Arcadia Dentistry for my dental care. Thank you Dr. Jahani and staff for always taking good care of me.< /text>< pics>

It’s not easy to start with a new dentist after having Dr. Jacobsen for over 42 years. But knowing he hand-picked Dr Ali Jahani initially gave me reassurance. But after 42 years it took more than Dr. Jacobsen’s sales pitch. Dr. Jahani won me over by his skill, patience, demeanor and general confidence. I’ve also lost 2 staff members of over 20 years to retirement or relocation but I am very happy with this dental office and very pleased with Dr. Jahani.<//text>

I was a patient of Dr. Jacobsen's for almost 20 years, and had excellent care. This week I was seen by Dr. Jahani. I was very impressed with him, and will continue my care here. Dr. Jahani was very kind, gentle, identified the source of my problem and resolved it during my visit, and committed to making my experience very pleasant. He explained everything very well, and played my favorite music when I was receiving treatment. I highly recommend this practice and Dr. Jahani.< /text>

Great experience with the teeth cleaning.  They took me in exactly at my scheduled time with all the COVID-19 precautions and I was out within 45 minutes.  The dental hygientist, DUSTY, was very nice and she provided me with a few additional tips on the proper methods for cleaning and flossing.</Review>

We LOVE Dr. Matt. He is so patient. My 3 year old just had an experience where she was TOUGH for him because she had 3 cavities and I didn’t want to sedate her and she really probably should have been. She was wiggly and crying so like I said, tough!He was so patient and didn’t make me feel like I was wasting his time. We came back a few weeks later and tried again. She started wiggly again but he and his assistant had the trick and showed her such love. She DID IT! She didn’t have to be sedated!!  We have been coming here for years and will forever!

Ps the assistant we LOVE is Amy. She is the best too!< /Text>

The staff at Gary B Jacobsen are excellent. My calls were returned the same day. When I walked into the office I was greeted with a smile from the receptionist.  The dental hygienist that cleaned my teeth was very personable and professional, she answered my questions and made suggestions of things to try. I had a question regarding my insurance and the office manager took the time to review the policy with me and answer my questions, I really appreciated this.</Review>

"Gentle care in detail"...That's what it says on the card and that's what my family and I have always gotten from Dr. Jacobsen and his team.  I've been a patient over 20 years and am very satisfied with this group.  The doctor has a gentle touch and does not rush me. everyone is always willing to explain treatment, his work holds up well, some of my fillings are over 15 years old.</review>

Dr. Ali (Jahani) took over for Dr. Jacobsen in his practice.  The office staff is nearly all the same.  Very easy to make appointments.  Very friendly staff.  Dr. Ali is personable and easy to interact with.  Have not had any dental work yet, but ordered retainers through his office, which turned out great.  Would certainly recommend.<//Review>

Dr. Jacobsen has been our family dentist since 1982.  He is one of the best dentists in the San Gabriel valley.  His staff is friendly, professional, and very experienced.<//text>

I HATE going to the dentist but Dr. Jacobsen's staff makes it a much more pleasant experience than what I've had in the past. I'm usually the patient who has a death grip on the chair but during my last two visits I found myself nodding off during a usually painful deep cleaning treatment.<//review>

<text>This is a busy location with very limited indoor seating due to COVID. The food was good, but not breathtaking like some of the other Corner Bakery locations. Service was quick, but I find toile having to hold a pager. Pancakes were great but the butter was a little stale.< /text>< pictures>

Service is grouchy, impatient and highly impersonal. Didn't leave a review the first time, but I will not go back there another go at it. Degrading experiences. Even the guys there aren't happily hospitable. Lost my appetite! Patronize a Starbucks where you're treated with warmth and basic niceness. Age neither is an excuse. Advice to this generally congested location in Westlake: SMILE.</Review>

<Text>I’ve been in there twice now and have never ordered...because I’ve been ignored both times. I get the people at the front were putting orders together but never once acknowledged me to say “hey I’ll be right with you” or anything...TWICE!

The worst food I've ever had. I ordered a salad and the lettuce was completely wilted, inedible. The kids meal came with a rock hard cookie and the sandwich was literally bread and ham nothing else on it! Kids menu doesn't allow customization which is annoying. Ordered pickup and they forgot 2 items. McDonalds would have been better than this place.< /Text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>I came here and ordered some breakfast to go. The prices were reasonable and the food was made quick.  One complaint that the opening hours are well after 7am.  For breakfast food you are missing half your clientele by that time.

The food presentation wasn't that great, but the taste was decent.  I'm giving this place 4 stars because eggs and bacon can only get so good, and I'm tired of paying 14+ for two eggs and a piece of bacon. It was nice to find some affordable choice</Review>< GmapID>

I like all Corner Bakeries. My only complaint was the person who took my order. I always get the panini grilled veggies. They didn't have it, so she suggested another sandwich.  It didn't have one vegetable in it. I think she chose something she liked.< /Text>

Absolutely LOVE this Corner Bakery. I use them for the catering for my office whenever we have guests renting our conference rooms for mediation and I can always rely on them to deliver everything I ordered, to be prompt, polite, and helpful when they arrive and make sure that I am satisfied with each and every order. Great food as well! Try one of their assorted sandwich baskets if you need something quick for a group and they have delicious breakfast catering too!</Review>

Loved the small harvest salad and my wife kept talking about how much she liked her tomato soup with basil!  She also raved about the chicken sandwich that went with order!
The Corner Market is a favorite of the couple that introduced my wife and I to the cafe.  And to make it even better, Makalah?, the cashier was most friendly!</Text>

WHY Would you discontinue the best thing on your menu? The chicken apple arugula sandwich was one of a kind and the best thing on your menu by far. Why in 1 million zillion trillion years would you just continue it?< /review>

A breakfast favorite for our entire family, the food, customer service and value here can't be beat. Favorites are Swiss Oatmeal, All American Scrambler and the Morning Rush specials. The bakery items are delicious as well, and I love the BOGO special on muffins after the noon hour.</Review>

Really needs some new management. I sat here for an hour at the only clean table I could find (and it was clean because I cleaned it off myself). While I was here, the registers all went offline, the coffee and creamer sat empty, the cashier told me they were out of clean coffee mugs, they got my order wrong, trash was left on the floor, not one single dirty table was cleaned up, and they ignored numerous customers waiting to be served. I used to love coming here. I don't plan on coming back soon.</review>

Too inconsistent. Had their power greens and ancient grains. Should have known by that name that its something the cooks had little training in chef school..... can you imagine taking class time for that "today I'm going to teach power grains and greens.. No make that ancient grains and power greens.... no today you can all go home because Im confused and don't know how to teach this topic'  Basically the leaves were unchopped, the dressing was not good, and in general the dish appeared just thrown together by the staff. They need to stick with what they are good with.</review>

There was a great selection of girls clothing, but felt the boys side was not quite as extensive. But maybe it was just the day I chose to go. Overall, they are very affordable with a very clean store.< /review></record>

Nails look soooo bad. They are shaped oddly, (I asked her to reshape twice due to the nails being crooked) and they still look horrible. I can't believe I paid 55 dollars for this. Horrible. Happy nails in Quartz hills is much better.</Text>

<Review>Great experience today! Lisa and Luanne were superb! They were both very attentive to my 85 year old Mother. Great job with gel pedicures and a mani for me. A little pricey but worth it... everything is a bit more since quarantine.</Review>< Gmap_id>

the service was quick, but like.... TOO quick. my nails were super rushed, and one of the workers said it was $95 for a “long” set (the length was not even the full nail tip) so i had to get a set that barely goes over my fingers and that was $50??? also, the acrylic is terrible. super bumpy and uneven, and they’re all different lengths. also the lady who told me the price also kept going back and forth between me and my sister and was watching and critiquing the person doing my nails constantly. the attitude was overall bad, and when me and my sister asked for the price, she seemed to hav just made it up on the spot. im never coming back here, i dont even know how this place is still in business</review>

I should've read the reviews before coming here. I will never come back. Ended up having to go to a different nail shop to finish what they couldn't/wouldn't do. They didn't even seem to care or use common sense as to what I needed even though I called and told them before coming. They told me to come at 1130 and I wasn't seen until after 12. They also forgot to mention cash only. And last but not least, this place is expensive. Granted it is the AV, but sheesh. Luckily I can say they weren't rude with me at all which I really appreciate granted everything else.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I have been getting my toes pedicured and an occasional nail manicure with my family for 3 years at this West Palmdale nail place whenever I need to treat myself...   A clean nail salon is a must for me!!!

They are very nice, they usually have a lot of people working, and they are very attentive to the needs of a happy customer. If you need something specific, all you need to do is ask...

I come here because I like the people that work at this nail place (Because there is like 50 nail salons on every corner), the classical music, tv, and if I need privacy for my eyebrows when I need them waxed, they have 2 private rooms.

$40 is the average price range for toes or nails without designs. $10 eyebrow wax!! This Happy Nails & Spa is right next to the Wild Buffalo Wing Plaza, as well as next door to the Goodwill...</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhFrqhpyMGBAlRUNV4iYoPk2bGoadtKDo2DS2h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOovUySli4z2BvURFPZYQ-Ln6kwfgzW13HsH-h3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzKJfVTD8nmNSJXNChRvLQ1phwmeD0R9xSTH1W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkq54U5w4iJQFlFoYmDDBmcYDeBdhnjaJOwrEb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2599aa5cc36ef:0xfa789907890211a3< /Gmap_id></record>

I made an appointment here for a manicure because they told me they were working by appointment only.
The day of my appointment I show up 15 min before and tell them I have an appointment. The lady in charge “looked” at her book and told me “I don’t see you” then I tried to explained and show her the phone call of when I made the appointment and she was so rude and ignore me and wouldn’t even address me.
They were ignoring me I left and called the salon again and told her I was just there for my appointment and she ignored me and then she said that they weren’t doing manicured that day after I went there and saw them doing it.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I went last night made an appointment. I had been here many times but never for acrylics just for pedicure. I got this smaller older woman who i believe is the owner or used to be. She was rude. She made me bleed MULTIPLE times. I woke today my hands are so sore they hurt. She drilled down too much on my actual nail. I don’t not recommend this place. And quite frankly i wish i never paid for my service. My nails are supposed to be coffin but she didn’t file them correctly, probably because she was too busy filing my fingers not my nails.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

If I could give. -10 stars, THAT would be too high! This is the worst nail salon I have ever been to! I needed my nails done, I was driving by, saw what I thought would be a nice shop, didn’t think to check out the reviews, unfortunately. So I went in, chose a “packet”, but when all was said and done, I ended up paying more than the quoted price, for the package I chose. Ok, I was satisfied with the service, thought my nails looked nice, so I paid the significant extra amount. Well, the very next day, I noticed that there was a chip, on more than one nail. Right away I called. I went back in, to have the shabby work “fixed”, left, and within two days, I kid you NOT! Within 2 days, the polish was peeling off! And I’m talking about GEL! It is dang near impossible to take gel polish off, if you try!!! Yet this mess, that was applied on top of the sanded down, “original” mess, almost immediately started to peel. I refuse to believe any of these people graduated cosmetology school! They are terrible!!! My guess is, once you’re in the chair, they over charge you, knowing you won’t be a return customer. I am not bitter, not a disgruntled customer. I am someone who, in good faith, went to Happy Nails for a service, and was ripped off. This review is to keep someone else from being ripped off! This nail salon should be put out of business. Word to the wise: DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS SHOP.</Review>

Very poor service. Felt rushed from the moment I walked through the door. Pedicure was quick and poorly done. I did not even stay for a manicure like i had planned. Will not come back and will not recommend.</text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>If you are wondering about checking out this nail shop- don’t. I asked for long coffin and I got short square nails. Still charged for long coffin. The staff was arguing with another  customer and very rude. Staff wants to rush you out of there. They ignore your questions, then yell and walk away. Never coming back here and I suggest you don’t either. My fingers were cut twice and I was ignored when I asked them to be careful. Terrible service and staff.< /Review>< pictures>

The person who did my manicure was great and took the time to soak my old gel polish off and went above and beyond with the massage and her customer service. The person who did my feet did it the lazy way and used the machine and took too much off so it took part of my nail.  Then he went too high with it and cut my toe. He was about to leave some of the old gel polish on when he was going to apply the new one. I told his coworker who talked to him to have him take the rest off.  He had an attitude the whole time and did a horrible job.  They didnt have the polish my sister or I had for our first choice either.<//review>

The guy that did my pedicure had attitude. I forgot my nail polish on the table and my feet were on the water already. I asked him to get it but he did not. And the nail polish was gone when it was time for him to use it. He made faces when i told him not to massage my feet nor to scrub it. I wanted a simple pedi, just cut nails,clean cuticles and put nail polish. I would never go back and if i ever did i do not want that guy.</Text>

I was sitting in Loann’s station she was extremely rude, she was rushing me and pulled my hand roughly through out the process . I specifically asked for coffin and came out with  weird circle squares with different lengths.. When the  nail polish got bubbles  she said “ its the pixels in your eyes.” Definitely won’t be coming back here.</review>

DONTTTTT COMMMMEE HERE!!!! Worst nail shop in my life I spend $110 dollars for myself and my daughter. I got dipping powder and all my nails lasted 2 days they were so thin.my dipping powder usually last 3 to 5 weeks not one or 2 days. My daughter got a full set and 3 nails broke in 1 day. We just moved to the area and tried them for the first time I’ll never waste my money again. I understand nothing is perfect but there’s is no way my daughter and myself had the same results. They just use low quality product. Let’s not mention the time (almost 4 hrs). HORRRIBLE! Lastly that dirty couch is disgusting I should of trusted my instinct then and walk out< /text>

The customer service is okay. They were nice ENOUGH. I walked in they told us the wait, which was an hour (with 3 people in chairs and 5 workers). We waited a little less than an hour about 50 minutes. I decided on acrylic. I told her what I wanted and we started. My first problem was she put a lot of primer on, burning the underneath of my nail. The second problem was she wasn’t wearing gloves, she kept rubbing her nose and touching my hands, The third problem is all of my nails are practically uneven. My nails are all short on one hand and long on the other. The fourth problem was she used the tools that she used on my hand on her hand. She would use a tool then look at her hand and do the same. The fifth problem was her opinion. Not to be rude but I didn’t ask whether you thought I should put pink or silver glitter. I asked do you have pink glitter. I didn’t ask if I should use a dark pink or light pink on my toes. I asked if i could use the same color. I didn’t ask wether I should use dark or light pink glitter. I asked if you had light pink glitter. My sixth problem was doing without asking. She painted my toes, the darker color when I asked for the lighter color. But to her it was too light for toes. On my hands I  got two nails with glitter. She decided to make the executive decision to paint every single toe with the glitter top coat without asking me. My seventh problem was how distracted she was. She was not putting her all into the nail. Looking around having a full on conversation with the lady who was cleaning, and forgetting to tell me to put my hand back in My eight problem, she rushed it all, rushing through the filing and acrylic applying. She did not support while filing . She let my nail go over the place and honestly hurt really bad.  My ninth problem is I was left peeling acrylic on my bare skin, a lot of it, upon further examination. My tenth problem, was she had dropped that contained the nail polish, breaking the top of the bottle. She continued to use the nail polish even tough the contents now contained broken bottle pieces. This was by far my worst experience at a nail shop. I do NOT recommend getting your nails done here. I did not appreciate any of this. and she acted like it was all fine, sunshine’s, unicorns, and rainbows. She was laughing it off, and I became annoyed. Please spare your time.<//text>

<time>1501528316875</time><rating>1</rating><review>Totally over it. I decided to write this review since this salon is apparently under new management. I received excellent service, everyone was polite and jolly. But the product sucked. My nails are not straight, they're bumpy so the acrylic didn't lay right, and i have a few already popping off and it's only been 3 days.
The new family that's running it sucks, i preferred the other family. I will be finding another salon to go to and refer people to. Shame, i really enjoyed this place.<//review>< Pictures>

I walked in and immediately wanted to walk back out. It was dirty and unkempt in its appearance. I wrote my name down and told one of the women what I wanted done and started to take a seat to wait when I looked at their extremely worn out and dirty couch. That's when I decided to take my business elsewhere. I couldn't get over the lack of cleanliness to actually get any services done.</Review>

<Review>I was very happy with my experience at happy nails on 10th Street W in Palmdale! I had my first full set in ten years done there and they looked perfect! I was also very pleased with my pedicure😊. But more than that, I had a great experience overall. The staff was so nice and friendly and made me feel very welcomed and comfortable. I’m going to get my nails done here from now on & will recommend them to everyone I know. This is the best nail salon in the AV!< /Review>< Pictures>

I am updating my previous review, since this place has taken care of many of the issues that I have had in the past. For pedicures, this has become my favorite place to go. The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 is a consistency issue. I always get the massage pedicure with callus removal, but the quality of the foot massage and the callus removal varies widely from “fantastic” to “not worth the extra money,” depending on who is wielding the cheese grater, but your feet will definitely look great when they’re done.

My biggest issue in the past was with sloppy application of nail gel. Some of their people were great and some were no so great. I no longer have gel nails, but it appears that most customers seem happy with their manicures.<//text>

<user_id>107406102377724756871</user_id><Text>First time trying out this salon for a wax. I should have looked at reviews. Terrible terrible terrible customer service. I walked and stood at the desk for a few minutes althought everyone looked at me whrn I walked in. When I was taken back the woman was snappy. When I explained I can't have baby oil on my face because I breakout she rudely said that she won't wax. I understand that its all she has and have no problem going somewhere else. The problem is with her extremely rude attitude. I do not recommend this salon because when you dont care about your customers then you might fo shady stuff.

After I left this place I went across the street to Sujey Nail bar and I was very pleased. I suggest going to Sujey Nail bar over this unsatisfactory place.< /Text><Rating>1</Rating>< username>

<text>I got my nails filled there because I couldn't go to my usual nail shop and it was a worst decision I have ever made. My nails were patchy and the prices were so overpriced, I payed 30 dollar for a fill and no design, also my nails were not even filled correctly it looks lumpy at the base and there is a gap in between the acrylic and the base of my nail. I am so upset and will not be returning and would advice one to waste their time and money there either.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>I feel humiliated. I've never had a Mani pedi before, but I know that when someone drapes a towel over your exposed legs and laughs with her colleagues whenever she applies a coat or scrubs your feet it can't be a good sign. I felt like i wanted crawl out of my skin. I speak Spanish so I get the appeal of taking a little smack with your friends but even the other costumer could she's was making fun of my size or my feet or whatever. I'm so shaken up. Definitely not going back.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

<text>Employees are very rude and the manager has an attitude with the customers, I asked her if she could do my nails, she said No she is on a break but when someone came in 2 seconds after me she took that person. I believe she told my no because I have a physical disability. When I told her that I will not be bring my service back so mentioned that they have enough customers.Why give money to a nail shop that doesn't value all customers the same. Thank you for your support on this... Please take your business somewhere else.</text>< Resp>

I've gone here for pedicures before which looked great. Today I got a backfill, acrylics, pink & white. WORDT NAILS I'VE EVER SEEN!!!! They're literally so terrible. They are making me sick looking at them. They're misshapen, all different lengths, they're just a huge mess. I had a guy, & his name was "Johnny". He was so slow & proceeded to tell me that "it's s long process so I should relax". He needs to find a new job because my 5 year old niece could do better nails. I paid 38$ for nails that looks like an a blind person did. & he cute me like 5 times, so not only do I have nails that look like sh**, they're soooo sore, so I can't even get these things fixed for a few days.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>This is one of my favorite parks in Natomas. It is one of the few parks with shade and also has a water feature spray park area that you can enjoy Memorial through Labor Day to keep you cool during the hot summer. Although this park had a tire swing, swings and a slide, it is not your typical playground. It’s set up more like a “Ninja Warrior” obstacle offering many different ways kids can jump, balance and climb. In addition, the park also has a BBQ, covered seating area, basket ball court, drinking fountain for humans and pets and plenty of grass areas. My family and I really enjoy this park.</review><Time>1529422437070</Time>< Resp>

This is a nice park , not too crowded. The play area is very clean. There is also a water area which is nice. There were play areas for both bigger and younger kids. There is also a nice area to ride bikes.< /review>

Excellent local restaurant with breakfast, lunch, and dinner served all day! Very quick and friendly service with huge portions of food. A small mistake was made with our order, but it was immediately corrected and a free Horchata was offered to make up for the issue. Definitely worth a visit and there is some outdoor seating available for dining at the location!<//text>

<Review>For many years I thought this was Aldaberto's but it's actually Alberto's. That doesn't take away from the fact that it is yummy Mexican food. Offers many combo plates and options plus they will customize orders to your liking. Don't be put off if the drive-thru line is long it moves quite fast.<//Review><gmapID>0x80900cf9213db4fb:0xb315c6238adb1cbb< /gmapID><user_name>john lopez<//user_name><resp>None<//resp><Time>1619994067429<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Cana asada burrito for breakfast was made fresh for me.It was prepared with enough spices and fillings to conquer my appetite.
Service was friendly and quick,before I left with food I was given extra napkins and additional salsa.
I recommend to stop by ,price was good for the size of burrito.
Not a long wait to be served.
I will return to try their breakfast burritos< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Their food is very messy. Almost as if they cared more about speed then presentation.  Their food isn't all that tasty either, aside from their enchiladas. Their tostada was disappointing and loaded with too much lettuce and onions and not enough shredded beef. Their burritos are also disappointing. Their prices are high for what the product is. All-in-all, if Im feeling Mexican food, I would hit up a taco truck before coming here.</Review>

I used to go to Alberto's in San Diego, CA which was always awesome. Then we to Ripon and by chance saw the same owned Albertos in Stockton we were so excited because people here just really don't get the real Mexican taste. I love this place.</review>

The chorizo, egg, potato & cheese remind me of my mom's breakfast burritos. Same with their bacon, egg, potato & cheese burrito. I ordered a regular pork/carnitas burrito and was surprised to see a big burrito with only meat. No beans or rice. Not what I wanted or was expecting. I did not see a sign that said regular is all meat. Their asada street style tacos (my definition not theirs) did not have the grilled steak asada flavor but an oven roasted flavor which was not what I was craving when wanting asada (steak) tacos, the meat was kind of similar to minced pot roast. Their asada fries changed, I liked the crinkle fries & other cheese they used to use. Not a fan of thin diner style fries, the new cheese & liquid that fills the to-go box. BUT you might like or love the flavors they offer. I will be back for their breakfast burritos for sure!!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Food does not taste bad. The prices are too high for what you get. The service is also hit or miss. Some of the cashiers or drive thru folk are just plain disinterested.<//review>

Since they recognized me they served my meal anyhow and allowed me to come back the following day and pay.

<Review>Let me start by saying my burrito shot out water oil juice it was so much of it got literally all over the place the burrito was so soggy I went back to talk to the lady about it she was very rude acted like I had a problem because I wasn't satisfied they remade it made me wait really long while they finished their orders through the line I stood out the window and watched the guy touch his nose a couple different times while he was sleeping towards he is they replacement order but I'm not going to eat it I'm going to give it away or throw it away very disappointed the first buy I took was good but after that it just got ruined through the way the burrito was made the second burrito literally just has asada and guacamole I don't know what they're doing in that place but they don't make the orders right for the people that really like the place stick with what you like but for me this is a no-go< /Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
I love going to this place but my previous visit was very unpleasant the lady that was helping me was very rude and unprofessional.  I only ask for a box just  in case I don’t finish my burrito and she just kept on asking why and at one point she told me “you don’t seem very happy!!!. I stayed calm and politely ask her again and she gave it to me this time she told me in a very very rude way @Are you happy now???!!!! I’ve never experienced such demeaning and rude and very unprofessional service from any restaurant I’ve been to.  I would still go to this place just because I love their food but I would never in a million years  would allow this horrible lady to take my orders.  I’m surprised she still works there.<//Review>

I ask for a beef burrito with no sour cream,
Once I got home there was No Meat and full of sour cream,  didn't have the time to go back,  so I called of course they didn't answer.  I I'm so disappointed.  I will never waste my time going back!</text>

First I’ll  start with the positives:
It was fast and the ladies in the front were super nice.
It was “clean”— it had a few bugs on the window ledges but 🤷🏻‍♀️.

The negatives:
The food-
I ordered a burrito that was supposed to be rice, beans and meat.
NORMALLY, burritos come with onions and salsa and cilantro BUT the one that they gave us were just like they said “TORTILLA, RICE, BEANS, and MEAT”. And separately, they gave us green salsa.
In there defense they gave me what they said that they were going to give me, I just thought that it would come with more.<//text>

10 out of 10!
The food was delicious and the portions were huge. Great value for the price.
It's a cozy place to sit down and have lunch or dinner for 2 or day out and eat on the covered patio.
It's a convenient walk from the Best Western Hotel, so a great choice for anyone who wants something good and authentic during their overnight stay.< /review>

First time going here. I looked over the menu and decided on a carne asada burrito. The speaker box made a god awful noise the entire time that literally hurt my ears. I asked the lady what was in it, she said it only had meat, guacamole, beans, and pico de gallo. For over $6! I ordered the super because it actually had substance in it. Sat in line behind 3 other cars and it took over 10 minutes. Finally to the window and total was over $13 for a burrito, medium soda (only 16oz), and a churro! Then she was using gloves but clearly did not understand glove etiquette because the finger tips were a nasty yellow color while the rest of the gloves were white. The burrito was huge, don’t get me wrong, but was very bland and messy. Bits of eggs were falling out of the tortilla and wrapper which should have no trace of egg on it at all. The churro was hard as a rock and tasted like gas. Completely disappointed and would not suggest. Will not be returning.<//Text>

The food is always good here. Sometimes I get the carne asada burrito with sour cream and cheese only. The cheese is not melted, but it would be 10x better if they could figure out how to do that.<//text>

Alberto's makes competitive Mexican food. Portions are substantial and filling. They cost a little more than your average but are worth it. They are getting better at processing from order to food pickup and out.< /Text>

They wanted to charge my husband who is glucose free 29.00 for meat and cheese, for a quart size when we ordered this many times before, for my son, we noticed they also over charge when you order. Well never go back to this place again.< /review>

I always get the same burrito from the yellow menu restaurants...a California burrito with Pico de Gallo. They have creeped up in price, but not at Alberto's. I appreciate them keeping their prices affordable when others are charging almost $10 for a burrito with fries and steak and cheese?! This is my new #1!< /Review>

I like the chain. This location consistently doesn't put enough salt on potatoes, but I've found if you ask them for extra salt on them, it's fine.< /Text>

The Shrimp Cocktail is near the top in my opinion. Breakfast Burritos among the best in town for that kind of establishment. Don't expect much atmosphere when dining inside but the kitchen staff is always friendly and helpful.< /text>

<date>1500782774413<//date><review>I'm from San Diego so I judge Mexican food based on what I grew up on in the area especially in my frequent visits to Mexico. I couldn't find a place that matches San Diego Mexican food until now. It tasted like I was back home. They knew how to make carne asada fries the right way: all the toppings (including beans) and finally real shredded cheese (vs that nasty nacho cheese the bay area is so fond of)! I'm bringing my family here.<//review></record>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>I decided on Mexican food for dinner. While placing my order, I noticed how the older woman taking my order was shooting long glares of the evil eye at the Black youth who was waiting for his order. I was facing her and two men were behind me who may have saw her clear displeasure for the youth. Finally, I told her if she'd focus on me what she was going through wouldn't hurt her so badly. In a calm nurturing tone, I repeated: Just focus on me. She realized what she was doing and smile bashfully. I guess she thought I, too, hated young Black males and would have no issue witnessing her cruelty towards this paying customer.  When his order was up, he kindly said thank you in a kind and mannerable tone. Breaking her stream of negativity was simple but my heart hurt. I prayed for that boy and asked God that he be spiritually cleansed from any bad spiritual influences she directed at him. Just how much do people expect our babies to take before they've soaked up so much distain their hope is untappable. Being kind is something worth having time for.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>
