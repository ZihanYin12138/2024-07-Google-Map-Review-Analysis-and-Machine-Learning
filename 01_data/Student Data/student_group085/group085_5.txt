<user_name>Debra Huffman<//user_name><Date>1624007936390</Date><rating>4<//rating><Text>I went to LJ's towing to help  a friend of ours get his truck out of impound, since the police department had it towed there. It actually was a great place. The employee that helped us, went far above the call of duty, by convincing his boss to let us take the truck, even though we were $20 short from the amount that was owed to get it out. I thought that this employee did a wonderful thing by doing that, because he really didn't have to do that at all. It was pretty awesome that he convinced his boss to go along with it. So, in short, I believe that LJ's towing is a pretty decent place.<//Text>< pics>

This is the worst company in Sacramento, ca.
They are the rudest people I have ever encountered; in my entire life.
There business is dirty;  their workers are slovenly & un kept.
From the moment I first had contact with these people; they have been nothing but rude & un helpful.
They are the  most unprofessional, grossest; & the most deplorable, group of discussing,human waist; I have ever encountered in my life.
Truly the spawn of Satan.< /Review>

<text>Did not inform me an appointment was required then refused to remove the $115 fee. Absolutely criminal. A tow of 1.5 miles and 22 hours of storage turned into $430.<//text>< pics>

<text>I mean I guess they didn't do anything wrong. But it is hard to give someone 5 stars when you're having to pay to get your car back from a tow yard. They can at least put free candy out by the cash register.</text>< name>

<text>My car got a flat on the freeway yesterday at 6pm came back three hours later to fix it. Nope! Its gone. After calling around finally found that lj towing has my car. It is now the next morning and they want $326.00 to release it. Screw this place! I feel like stanley ipkiss at the auto shop. These greedy people are worse than PS5 & Xbox scalpers!</text>< Pics>

The employee could not explain what an “extended price” meant even when this extended price more than doubled the cost of the tow. Hopefully others get a chance to call their insurance for a tow if they are transported via ambulance after an accident (like we were). I hope CHP stop using this place.

Thanks for the sympathy LJ,
Eric<//Review>

Saying this has been one of the roughest times in my life is an understatement. As most of you know, my beautiful 18 year old daughter died this past week as a result of an automobile accident.

Alaina's accident was on March 17th.
Her car was towed from the scene by LJs towing company, 2600 North Ave Sacramento CA 95838.
At 7am on Wednesday morning, while sitting at my daughter's bedside, I reached out to my friend, Stacey, at Golden State Towing and asked them to get Alaina's car. I don't know why it was important to me to have possession of the car, but I wanted to. I needed to know we had it, and be able to get anything out of it that may be important to the family. I also know we would be being charged a storage fee until the vehicle was picked up.
Stacey immediately contacted LJs and explained my situation. LJs stonewalled her and informed her that can only deal with the registered owner of the vehicle (me). She again explained my daughter was in the hospital on life support and I had given her permission to obtain the vehicle. LJs refused to help. They told Stacey I would have to provide a notarized letter giving her permission to get the vehicle. I told Stacey we would just have to deal with it at a later time, I had more important things to devote my time to.
I heard due to the severity of the crash I, as her mother, should not see the vehicle. And I don't want to. But I wanted Golden State to have it and I wanted my friend to go through the car and get Alaina's personal possessions for me.
Early Saturday morning my daughter was taken into the OR, gifted her organs for donations, and was declared. On Saturday afternoon, my sister had a mobile notary meet at her home to get the letter Stacey needed to obtain my daughter's vehicle.
After Golden State obtained my notirized letter and went to LJs, Stacey faced many issues at the tow yard. They refused to even deal with Stacey, even with the notarized letter. They would not allow Golden State to remove the vehicle or view it because they did not have a printout of their motor carrier permit but had provided a digital copy. LJs proceeded to argue with them about the law delaying the removal process even further. After over an hour, Stacey was finally able to get my baby's car.

LJs has an obvious conflict of interest for towing cars, both on CHP and Sheriff rotation, as they own multiple wrecking yards that profit tremendously for the cars they keep with no intent on releasing. They make the price to obtain your towed vehicle as high as possible in the hopes you cannot afford to retrieve it and make the releasing of the vehicle as unpleasant as possible in hopes you walk away from the car and it can be sent to their own dismantelers to make even more money.

I was charged over $600 for the tow to the yard. They took two trucks out to tow one car, a blatant scam and ploy to obtain more revenue for the tow. $60 a day for storage, and $115 for being there on a Saturday. 5 days, over $1000, less than 10 miles from the site.

What LJs did may have been legal, but it was by no means ethical or moral.

No compassion and horrible buisness dealing.

My car stalled in the fast lane on the freeway, and these guys arrived in the blink of an eye! The driver's emphasis on safety put my frazzled mind at ease, and he was particularly cautious with my car. They truly went above and beyond to make me feel safe and comfortable.

Looked at a car they had for sale, used my carfax, went and got the money, came back 20 minutes later, and they said " oh sorry but that was sold 3 days ago to the managers son."

If there was any way to give this place negative 5 * I would.
Extremely uncooperative. I had to camp out in their yard to show that I wasn't letting my '01 Durango R/T go.
After a BS arrest, my dog going to jail and my car getting impounded, a $368 bill (even tho I was there to pick it up in less than 12 he's) then having to get it tow out of their yard because I had been in the middle of working on it when I was arrested, they still wasn't cutting a broke homeless man a break.
They contract with Woodland PD and do everything they can to keep your vehicle. Cause don't you know, West coast dismantelers is in the same building.
Hope you enjoy the $4000 less a month cause you I st St lost a customer I know. 🤯< /text>

<review>Just got off the phone with the owner. He was following my car too closely - speeding - in a 25 mph SCHOOL ZONE on Cirby Way. There was a graduation and pedestrians were attempting to cross the busy road. AS PEDESTRIANS ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT OF WAY, I slowed to a stop to allow them to pass. The owner - as is reviewed several times as being unable to drive safely - didn't want to stop so he laid on his horn. My 10 yr old son turned to look at him and he flipped him off. I called to report the driver as that is no way to conduct a business and turns out it is the owner, who says I slammed on my brakes. Although I did not, I am certain it does not warrant flipping off a child.  I doubt he has a real successful business, but I can't imagine anyone trusting him with transporting their vehicle given the review history of erratic driving AND charming manners.< /review>< pics>

Worst place in the world. They work for county code enforcement they have a contract with them and the cops. They towed my fathers car for code enforcement eventho i had tried to tell CE i was trying to get the car moved out of the driveway into the garage. They stole a car then when my father tried to ask them if he could get the tools my deceased mother gave him out of the trunk they said no and laughed. These people are EVIL.< /Text>

LJ's towing Company is a joke. the guy on the phone was rude. lied to us about the cost. And lied saying they were never in our car when there's Permatex all over the back seat. They're the same company on 809 Reading st. And 2600 North Avenue.  Don't call this Tow company.< /text>

This place towed my vehicle from my appartment complex when it had my sticker in window. Called me 5 days later since I reported it stolen and stuck it to me. Said they found it in north natomis. When I got back to the apartments I seen that they were the tow company the appartments had a contract with to tow.<//Text>

<Text>After my accident i asked the the tow driver if he could wait while another car arrived for me to transfer my things to and he misled me saying it was only going to cost more. So i grabbed what i could and went to talk with the police, as i did the tow driver came up to me and just handed me a card saying the car would be towed to their yard. Before I could speak with the tow driver again he was gone.<//Text></record>

This older guy with tattoos on his hands cut us off and ran us off the road. He drives a flatbed, license plate #89230Z1, was on his phone and then flipped us off! Called to report and the answering service for this company is a joke too. Not professional at all.</review>

<Date>1607359902235< /Date><review>I had repair service done at Airstream Orange County and although I did not purchase my Airstream from this dealership, the customer service I received from the employees/managers is far superior. It is very apparent that the management team has effectively instilled a 'customer first' environment, which is few and far between in today's world. I would recommend this dealership without hesitation.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The Airstream Orange County Service Department and Personnel are incompetent and irresponsible.

Since taking ownership of our brand-new Interstate about 4 months ago, our van has been in the Service department on and off for over 6 weeks. In October, I brought the van in to deal with a few minor problems and a Mercedes recall which should have been dealt with prior to delivery. When I picked it up two weeks later, there was a dent and deep scratches on the front fender that cannot be just polished away. Airstream service blamed Mercedes but took no responsibility. Around November, one of the CZone monitors and the Fantastic fan malfunctioned. It took them over 3 weeks to get parts and another week to have them installed. They blamed COVID-19 for the delays and it finally got fixed this past weekend 3 months later. Around December, we started to get a chassis battery low voltage warning. I brought the van in last week and they determined that the battery minder settings needed to be changed and said they fixed it. Last night, while boondocking for a single night with my wife, we got the same warning message; obviously, not fixed. When I picked up the van this past Saturday, I had questions regarding the Victron Solar Management system. Their Tech told me all solar power goes to the House batteries, which is incorrect as one of the panels is dedicated to the chassis battery. The tech angrily insisted he was correct because in his own words “I’ve installed solar panels on million-dollar homes”. That may be so, but he doesn’t know much about the solar power system on a 2020 Interstate.

I rarely give bad reviews. I am 55 years old and have better things to do. Having owned numerous cars and boats in my lifetime, I expected to have problems with what can be considered a small condo on wheels. The one-star review is not really about the issues outlined above. It is mostly about feeling violated from what I saw (and smelled) when picking up my van this past Saturday. I brought the van in for service last week with empty waste tanks. I picked it up this past Saturday with the black tank at 45%. Apparently, their techs were using my van as their own personal toilet. Not only did they fail to dump their own waste from the tank prior to pick up, they didn’t even have the decency to clean the toilet bowl, which looked like it was violated by a pack of Parvo infected dogs.
I texted a complaint to my salesperson yesterday, who immediately notified the operations manager who contacted me today to offer cheap remorse. He was pleasant enough on the phone and apologetic but once again, assumed no responsibility. He stated that none of his staff members admitted to using our toilet (what a surprise) and then goes on to tell me they have a homeless problem in the area and suggests that perhaps the van was left unlocked and used by a homeless person. If this is the case, the operations manager at a minimum is admitting to mismanagement, and at worst, gross incompetence.  Leaving our van unlocked at night while being aware of a local homeless problem is even more problematic than a dirty toilet bowl.

If you are local to Orange County and buying a new Airstream because you hope not to drive too far when service is needed (as we did), you may want to think twice. Yes, they are beautiful rigs, well designed and engineered, but like all other RV’s are prone to problems. And if you can’t find a competent and responsible service center local to you, you’ll be spending more time miserable in a service bay than happy at a campsite.< /Review>< Pictures>

Had to bring in my 2018 Airstream Interstate to get a new upgraded battery system and some new upgraded cabinet latches installed. Fortunately I was lucky enough to work with their service manager Dillon Johnson who provided me with outstanding customer service from start to finish. He was super kind, patient, understanding, knowledgeable, efficient in covering all the bases and ensuring everything was taken care of with my Airstream. Orange County Airstream is obviously totally blessed to have him as part of their service team.
Sincerely with best wishes,

Candice is top notch! We were treated as expected when purchasing from a luxury brand like Airstream. We purchased our Airstream Interstate and Candice was a pleasure to do business with through the entire process. We felt comfortable, welcome, and happy with our purchase. We have already sent others to Airstream OC and we plan to do a lot of business with Candice! Thank you so much you made our dreams a reality!<//text>

Overall a pretty awesome experience. I walked in and wondered around for a little. Don came out and started talking to me about my Jeep, than about all the questions I had about the Interstate and than the Caravel. At no time did I feel any pressure to buy, which I liked. I also like the fact that Don not only took care of me while I was in the store; but he also offered to get my Service Dog a bowl of water. It’s little things like this that wins my business. I definitely recommend and will be back once I figure out if I am going in an Interstate or a carvel.< /Text>

< Review>
This is a very nice place to see a good selection of Airstream trailers. They have short trailers about 16 feet long to 27 feet long, lots of color choices inside the trailers and even have the new Nest trailer. The one made of three pieces of fiberglass on the outside of the trailer.

They also have a few used trailers to look at too!  The sales man I spoke with was knowledgeable and didn't even have to go look up prices on anything he knew all the information from his memory. And a very nice fellow to speak with two! He let my friend and I look all through the trailers at our own pace with absolutely no pressure.

I truly enjoyed my shopping experience there. And recommend if you're looking for an Airstream this is the place to go. One last thing the salesman did mention that the Airstream trailer lot was moving up the street a few blocks so be sure to double-check the address when you go.</Review>

<rate>2</rate><Text>Service at Airstream OC definitely is subpar.  Client facing crew is understaffed, apparently only Ricky (who is very nice) works there but there is some guy who sits in the office that seemingly does nothing (at least during the half dozen times I've been there).   They are nice but not responsive, quick nor overly concerned about quality.  On the few recent occasions when I've had repairs done, I've had to wait multiple weeks for completion and having to chase them for updates / guestimates for completion then upon picking up the rig only to find pieces and parts that were not put back in place or having something else screwed up.<//Text>< pictures>

This is the place to go to get your Silver twinkie!  So many choices both new and preowned. Really you can't make a bad decision.  We worked with Eric Troester.
Eric helped us decide what would work best for us and we couldn't be happier. Did you know Airstream is all American built in Ohio, no company debt and continually in business since 1933?   Any issues we have had they gladly resolved. These Silver Bullets are so well made and the quality is evident from the moment you step in. Go ahead and compare to anything else out there. We are so happy to have joined the"Riveted Life". Thanks Eric and the whole Airstream family!< /text>

Erick S is the best and most honest salesperson anywhere. we have been looking at airstreams for years! All sales people about the same. From the hello till our purchase, we felt a complete trust in his guidance. There is not enough space to write all about him. We are proud to say he has become our friend and when it’s time to purchase the next size, we will be buying from him. The general manager is also a stand up guy. Look, if you are looking for a cheap airstream, then you are dumb. So when you are ready to be treated well, ask for Erick!</text>

Everything went so smoothly. They were friendly and so courteous.  When the service took longer than anticipated, Danny the service manager offered to deliver my Bambi to me in San Diego.  They cleaned it inside and out, which was quite a job after my 5 week camping trip. I really enjoyed the experience because of the friendliness of the parts and service department personal. I will use them again.< /Review>

We have a dream to own an airstream and saw all the trailers while driving past on our way to Disneyland so we stopped back the next day. We went through all the new ones in the length we wanted, and then looked at the used ones. There is this cute little 2014 and Eric, sales guy, said it was 54,900. Shocked 😳 we returned to our hotel and started looking on the web a little closer to home. To our surprise, while comparing what we saw to what is available elsewhere, we discover this same dealer is having a clearance sale and the trailer we were standing in is listed at 38,990 🤔.

Do your research before you go there, particularly if you are a woman.< /Review>

Me and my wife have been shopping around for sometime for a good Airstream mechanic. Found this place and was willing to drive 2 hours to get our Airstream maintained. At first glance we had left our 2014 Airstream there for a couple days and it looked like it was not even touched. However, even being extremely busy (2 weeks behind on work) they were able to fit us in and took care of all my concerns that they could. Cameron the maintenance tech/manager is extremely helpful and gave me renewed faith in Airstream mechanics. I will not talk bad about any other business but having to drive 2 hours was worth it even though there is an "RV Dealer local" that we could have gone too. These guys are on point. Will absolutely be coming back.</Review>

Do your homework..... bought a 2017 for $85,000
Do not impulse buy!! Shopped around and the Same Airstream is $68,000 at Toscana RV.
When it says, " will not be undersold" they do not stand by this statement.</text>

Updated.. continuous nightmare of huge proportions

So I thought I’d do a add on to my previous review..wish I could say one nice or one positive thing about airstream inland valley or airstream Orange County.. and yes , in truth I do hope that my reviews would cost them both dearly as they deserve to suffer for the way they treat some customers.All of their customers deserve to be treated as i read some are ,

in that all  get 5 star treatment and not stolen from, blown off, and never to be contacted  or care enough about  to go out of way to correct such horrible service and down right scandleless business practices..

So as airstream knew when I was purchasing my dream from them I was panning on extensive travel

I have had to postpone my plans for several weeks maybe months due to my foot falling through my floor that was of course checked out throughly by Danny and his guys while they had it for six weeks plus prior to delivery
So I was told in the beginning that it was just a squeak
And NOT TO WORRY IT WAS SOUND AND NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT!!

Well it was or is a leak that has rotted my trailer floor so badly it literally just fell apart one day completely with only the vinyl keeping my foot from going all the way through to ground. No joke.. yeah this would have been so safe sound in Alaska .. thanks airstream guys!!

And it’s been a year since my nightmare started and no surprise I’ve not heard a word from either airstream ficility .. so now what ? Well being as they care not at all in how they treat some people I’m not sure what I do with a 65,000.00 dollar trailer with a rotted out floor

Don’t get to have my dream of travel that’s for sure

So yes , I’m mad ... sad.. out of 65,000.00& I hope many will feel for the some of us who mean nothing to them and go out of state . Get a way better deal and let airstream here feel the hurt  and suffer the financial pain they enjoy causing some without care in any way

When it was delievered it was dirty all the stuff I paid extra for either was a complete joke or not there or didn't work
, as in I couldn't open a window and use the awing at the same time
The medicine cabinet I paid for was a piece of junk couldn't stay open and was mounted using a rotted piece of wood

I swear they used old one from a gutted airstream on the lot and took one second to put it in mine

It was a horrible mess not one second of respect was showed to my trailer much less anything I paid for done or fixed .. nothing and I had even gone there twice to check in and just got totally lied to and ripped off for my retirement money.. I ordered 2 Honda generators got Yamaha ones instead

My shabby treatment goes on in more detail ..but you get the pattern , it the same way throughout my experience and extends right back to Scott of inland valley airstream and his sales team

They saw a very excited woman who they all could take total advantage of . who trusted them all so they absolutely played that and took all my investment pocketed it while patting themselves on the back

And not caring one bit to return money they got for things not delievered

And Scott just pushed it at me upon delivery knowing full well when the excitement settled down and I started to really see and learn how this all works I'd know just how badly I was ripped off..

It's a really sad way of things. No honor,
No remorse,
No refund on the obviously things I should have been refunded on and yes of course because I've not got the time or lawyer or energy to deal with and explain what's right ,good , decent as opposed to their rip off act any more , they are happy dancing , (no doubt) that I've just finally gone away.

So just beware
I really thought they were stand up people and company

I trusted them .
I got major league taken ..

You were warned

Happy life and good luck!

Been going to Golden Crown for years, had tried many other barber shops before and no one could match their quality, consistency, and price. i trusted them with the cut for my wedding, along with all my groomsmen, and everyone i️ recommend come here makes this their spot. just try it, and bring cash.</review>

<Text>I went first thing on a Saturday morning. All the barbers were taken except one. I got one of the worst haircuts of my life. I was spun around not facing the mirror the entire time which makes no sense. The cut looked like it was from someone still in barber school. The blending was terrible and he changed attachments 10 times, hitting my ears and neck repeatedly. He finished with the most abrasive straight razor neck shave where I had to use lotion when I got home to ease the razor burn. I'm only giving two stars because the hours were good and the guys seemed nice enough but some of them need to find another line of work.</Text>< pics>

Very nice! Definitely recommend this place to everyone.
I was wondering where to go get a cut, I saw the one off of Crown valley, same name and everything. Went there but it was too small of a place, especially now and my father did th not like it. Then, I saw this, same name/franchise? And took a chance to drive all the way over and it was awesome!
The place is classy. The barbers are chill! It was quiet when I went and I liked it. Not rushed at all, the cuts are meticulously done. Details are everything! Worth it!
Will come back!<//review>

Concerning when the barber keeps you facing away from mirror the whole time.

Great Barbershop! The atmosphere is hilarious...always walk away with smile. Kia is great to work with, I am a regular with him. The other barbers are all very talented and seem to do great cuts. A really good value for your money- professional service, good barbershop bantering and I always feel welcomed when I walk in the door.</Review>

Price and walk-in service is good.  However,  they are more into socializing with coworkers than making customers comfortable.  I have heard them talking about customers in a negative way multiple times.</text>

<Review>It was my first time there today and i felt really nervous. As soon as i got in they greeted me and i felt super welcomed. The guys were constantly making jokes and laughing and it was great vibe all around. Forgot my barbers name but he gave me the best haircut i’ve ever had. Def coming back  and you can’t beat the price. Good prices and great haircuts.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Go to spot to get trimmed up. This place gets BUSY, but you're usually in and out in an hour or less. Never had a bad cut, the barbers will give you exactly what you want. The banter is usually good for a few laughs. Always look and smell great when I leave. Lines are straight, the straight razor line up at the end of every cut is classy and the bay rum splash leaves you feeling like a man's man.</Text>< Pictures>

The first time I went here I got a really good cut and the barber was helpful and gave me a good cut, the second time I went the barber I got did not seem too interested in cutting my hair or talking to me about what I want and completely messed me up even though he had an exact picture to go off. I probably won’t return after such a negative experience</Review>

First and foremost, this place is a barber shop. It is not a Sport Clips or Supercuts, not a salon, not a spa. It is a barber shop. There are no reservations or appointments, you get your chair after everyone else who was there before you. The last cut is 15 minutes before the listed close time, so don't be late!  Payments are CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM in the corner of the shop, but you should still have cash on hand before walking in as a courtesy to the barbers.  The cut pricing is reasonable. $20 for an adult cut, $5 for a beard trim, $16 for a child cut, and $14 for military (with a valid ID).

The barbers are professionals. Let them know what you're looking to get done and they will make it happen. If you don't have an idea as to what you want, figure it out before you sit down. Help them help you!

Some rebuttals for those who have expressed concerns:
- Yes, even though it is busy and there is a line, they are allowed to take breaks to go and get food or to make a Starbucks run. As mentioned before, if you do not want to wait in line, don't. Nobody is forcing you to be here. Go make an appointment at one of the franchised hair salons and they will help you out. If you feel like the barbers have no sense of urgency, that's on you. Leave. Again, nobody is forcing you to be here.
- If you can find a cheaper haircut elsewhere, go for it. Again, nobody is forcing you to be here. A 1 star rating because you don't want to pay $20 for a haircut makes you look bad (which is probably the case if you're paying $8 for a haircut from WalMart).<//text>

All these negative reviewers need to go make an appointment with their momma's stylist where they've been getting their haircut their whole lives.
It's called a line, you sometimes wait in it for good service. Golden Crown is a 'first come, first serve' shop, no taking numbers like your mom when she's waiting for meat - so grab a chair, play with your stupid phone and wait for the best hair cut your pansy ass is ever gonna get. Oh, and be sure to grab some pomade before you hit the street looking like your nappy ass just woke up from a pillow biting slumber party.<//text>

Always get a great haircut for me and the boy. Conversation can be a little salty so watch your little ones. Expect a wait, it's worth it. Sit down, watch something on TV, and wait your turn.<//Review>

They'll be watching the t.v joking with one another. Take long ass breaks knowing they are backed up. Ive been waiting for almost 2 hours and only 3 people have left. With 3 barbers on the floor.

Best pad thai in the area. Seriously, you cannot go wrong with their pad thai. Their fresh rolls are also no joke. They are the largest fresh rolls I've ever seen and the dipping sauce is so good. Pick up has been super easy and this place has definitely become one of my neighborhood favorites.<//Text>

Surprised at how low the rating is for this place! Great tasting Thai food! The BBQ Chicken over fried rice was particularly delicious.</review>

They offer a vast variety of fresh food. I enjoy eating here. The employees are always super nice, rates are fair and the spot is always well organised.</Text>

<Text>Food was delicious and piping hot. The curry noodles were a bit spicy. Although I prefer non-spicy food, I was able to tolerate the heat.<//Text>< Pictures>

This place was great! Fast service, very attentive staff and an stopped that's modern but classic. We had a great conversation about the picture of the elephant for a solid half hour.

The food was also pretty good. Judging a places ratings for spicy is always hard. I love spicy food so I guess my tolerance was just up there. Or the Chili's in this batch just weren't super hot? Either way, delicious food!!!</text>

Great self-serve/to-go Thai option in South Berkeley. Smaller menu than nearby Thai options in downtown Berkeley, but similar in quality and speed of service. Just opened new dining room Jan 2019. I recommend their Khal Soi (curry egg noodles pictured).< /review>

She said no. So, I ordered yellow curry with veggies. While eating the curry I noticed there was a couple pieces of chicken in my curry. Not enough to where they messed up the order but enough to know that all the curry is cooked in the same pot and that if you order yellow curry they just sift out the chicken. I find this disappointing. Also was a bit annoyed that they have a $20.00 minimum for visa etc. If you don't meet the minimum you pay 50 cents. A bit strange for dining in or take out. Typically this is more common if you order delivery. The curry was ok.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwIkY6ZmGc7peM5gMvi_g-763ib8ZYDZ0mSEIj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Ginn Thai Canteen was not the absolute best Thai I’ve ever had, but they still have a great business. Their prices are affordable, the atmosphere is great, and it really feels like it has a good street food style.</text>

Good Thai food: had a yellow Thai curry and a Pad Thai there on separate occasions. Both were tasty. The restaurant also recently renovated its seating area so it is no longer just take-out. Service is prompt. Would have maybe liked to see a bit more chicken in my meals.</Text>

<Text>They unfairly charged extra for beef on pad thai & didn’t really care to remedy the situation when I asked about the extra charge & explained that their menu was misleading, instead they said “we already made it, sorry”.

The menu has a chili pad thai listed with an * that describes an additional charge for beef or shrimp, while the authentic pad thai does not. They also did not communicate there’s an extra charge for beef when the order was placed.

This place has excellent food, but the level of empathy, customer communication, & willingness to remedy the situation is appalling.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Food is ok. But the customer service could be improved.

<rate>1</rate><review>We had been to this place before and thought it was pretty good but this time my wife found a rock in the brown rice. Its really not the fact that she almost broke her tooth on a small piece of granite looking rock (she did break the rock in two), its the fact that when we called they had nothing to say and nothing to offer. The person who took her call literally said "sorry, thank you, good bye" and hug up the phone on her. When she called back to talk with the manager they were no where to be found and even after emailing the manager we have heard nothing. Truly unacceptable customer service. We wont be eating there again as we would rather give our business to other places like Easy Creole who has stellar customer service and great food.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80857e7bdaff4a0f:0xb1a5a3bb51aa06ad< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I reallyyyyyyy REALLY wanted to like this place since it's only two blocks from where I work and the food is decent. However, the last couple of times I've gone there, I've had issues. I once ordered spring rolls that cost me almost $10 to only be disappointed by the unauthentic taste and shortage of portion. I basically got two small chubby wrapped spring rolls, with coleslaw veges and fresh-out-of-the-pan hot tofu pieces.

The last time I went, I ordered their Mushroom eggplant basil dish, with chicken. When receiving my order, I noticed that the portion was a tad bit on the short side but assumed it was because of the huge bowl it was served in. After a couple of bites, I couldn't find any mushrooms or bell peppers. I let the cashier know and apparently, they were out. Why would you serve the item when you don't have all of the ingredients, and sell it for the same price of almost $10? Ridiculous. He told me he'll comp me the next time I go back, but how is he going to keep track of that? Humph!< /Review>

Great little affordable eatery when you want a quick bite (very limited counter seating inside & just a couple tables outside). All prices include tax (yes!) and are generally around $8 for what seems to be more-authentic-than-most Thai food.

The curry I tried wasn't marked spicy but definitely had some spice kick, so be sure to ask first if you're spice sensitive. My friend is addicted to their Pad See Ew.

FYI: They are closed 3-5PM, so don't show up then! Heard they may start being open on weekends (hurray!)< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>The food is good, but,  in the 4 times I've eaten there, they have messed up the order twice. I just ordered take out in person so there wouldn't be any confusion. Cashew Chicken please with "no mushrooms". I repeated it twice and looked him in the eye. He responded with "yes sir, cashew chicken, no mushrooms" and looked like he got it. I got home and...fu*£! mushrooms! I called to complain and a woman answered that didn't speak English well and couldn't understand. I just drove back and retuned it and I'm hungry, looking somewhere else.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80857e7bdaff4a0f:0xb1a5a3bb51aa06ad</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The staff is very nice, but the food was very lackluster. A meal is affordable, but the portions are on the smaller side. There's a counter that you order from, and that's basically the whole place (not really a sit-down place, if that's your thing). All things considered, I'd say this place lies somewhere between bad and average.<//text>

< Review>
First I want to note that Exclusive motors was recommended by Haydon Bros just down the street. I took my Mercedes here to have a leak fixed. The quick visual diagnoses given to me was that the injector pump seals needed to be replaced. After picking up the car I got home and noticed it was still leaking and still wet underneath. I was told that the technician working on the car did not follow the proper procedures that Exclusive Motors has in place which was that the wet areas should have been cleaned. From my basic knowledge of mechanics everything should have been cleaned before to be able to diagnose and track down the leak so not only was it not cleaned before to correctly find the leak but it was not cleaned at all. I took the car back here for a 2nd time so they could properly finish the job. I was then told that the wet areas have been cleaned, the car was driven several miles up and down Orangethorpe and that it looked good but that it could be leaking from somewhere else on the injector pump and to drive it for a week and bring it back. After picking the car up for the 2nd time I noticed right when I stopped in my driveway it had been cleaned but was still leaking. I brought it back for a 3rd time. I was told that this leak is difficult to track down and that several other seals including seals on the engine block may need replacing and that it will cost another $1,100. I understand that the leak may not be an easy fix but that is exactly why I took the car to a professional. The end result is that I paid $534 plus the inconvenience of my time taking it here 3 times and my car is still leaking. Won't be going back here unless the company wants to make this right.</Review>

Ron and his  team are awesome! They provide terrific service (loaner cars available) at prices far below the dealerships. QUALITY IS THE SAME!!! My car presented with a very mysterious problem (engine code not seen before) and he took the time to get to the bottom of it. I really appreciate the technical know how and personable professional service. THANK YOU!!!<//review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcd137b1e7dc7f:0xb717ba95d4f4d0fb< /Gmap_id><Review>I began having my cars serviced and maintained by Exclusive Motors in 2006, when I purchased a Mercedes E-320 from their affiliated sales area. They now care for our newer E-350 and GLE-350 as well.

Ron Erickson, the owner of Exclusive Motors, has always treated both my wife and me fairly and honestly. Ron and his staff know Mercedes cars in and out, and have the diagnostic equipment that few if any independent Mercedes repair shops have. I have every confidence Exclusive will only recommend repairs and servicing that is required, and have never questioned me if I chose to defer a service cycle for a few months. I love the fact that my wife can work equally well with this team without fear they will "sell" her something just because she's a woman - I've seen that garbage done at other places.

I'm particularly impressed with the fact that the team knows the nuances of the latest models, including the different materials used on the newest car's brakes, the wear characteristics and how to lengthen the wear time, etc. The team continues to satisfy our car servicing needs.< /Review>< rating>

We are new to the area so were hesitant about trying out a new mechanic for our Mercedes. I'm glad to report that Ron and Exclusive Motors have taken good care of us so far. They are honest and dependable, they deliver the work as promised at the rate that was discussed. Ron even gave us information on a Mercedes recall that will probably save us a lot of money.<//review>

We used the "first time" coupon on their website and tested out the service. That was 8 years ago and we still use Ron and the team for all repairs. I will call Ron about repairs even if the car is out of state and requires immediate service by another shop. I also purchased a pre-owned from Exclusive because I knew I could rely on the car being safe and checked out completely. We have had zero issues or concerns. The prices are reasonable and seem to be lower than local dealer service. The work is warrantied. As well, we stick to buying Mercedes because we have reliable service.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I was in the area visiting family during the week and had trouble with my car, it's a Mercedes Benz. I asked somebody near by if they knew of anybody that specialized in my type of car, they referred me to Ron at Exclusive Motors. This guy was awesome, he was fair and he didn't try to get me for extra money on repairs that I didn't need. He had his guys take a look at it and I was on the road again in no time. Thank you Ron for your awesome service....

<Review>Ron has taken care of all of my Mercedes for over 20 years. You will never find anyone in the automotive business that is more knowledgeable than Ron. The real bonus is that he truly cares that you get the best deal to repair your car....and he goes out of his way to insure it.

If you are still frequenting your local dealer, you are being overcharged and possibly paying for unnecessary repairs. I took my car into the dealer for a "free" oil change and they found almost $2000 in repairs that Ron quickly diagnosed as unnecessary.

I rarely recommend anyone but I do recommend Exclusive 100%. Why trust your Mercedes or Lexus to anyone else?</Review>< Pictures>

<UserId.>106725683174889506566< /UserId.><Text>Just bought my 2nd Mercedes from John & Ron at Exclusive and that's two in one year! Prior to that, they serviced my 2002 LS 430 till it hit 250K miles. Its hard to put into words how great these guys are, in sales they WILL get you the best deal with the best possible rate and their cars are perfect. Its always best to buy one that THEY serviced so you know its been well loved by true professionals. In servicing vehicles, they are number one! I've given their names to others and now, they will go no where else. Don't bother with the rest, these guys are THE BEST!

<review>I have been an Exclusive Motors customer for many years, now on my second E-class wagon and have come to rely on Ron and team's honest approach and high quality work.  Ron is the kind of guy who has often told me to defer some work with a comment of "Let's keep an eye on it for awhile", which I really appreciate.  We recently extended our relationship with Exclusive by buying an E-class sedan from John and found that experience to be great as well.</review>< gmap_id>

If you own a Mercedes, this is THE place to take your car for service. The prices are fair, they only do what needs to be done and they back their work 100%. But I have never had to take my car back a second time for the same thing! Ron and the crew are personable and do not over book, giving your car the maximum attention. There are loaners, if needed!</review>

Premier Chrysler gave me a $600 estimate after giving me a "discount" from $800, Craig fixed it for less than $300.  This is like local businesses were run back in the 50s.  Craig runs an honorable garage and cares about having you back.</review>

We have been taking our Mercedes vehicles to Ron and his staff since the early 90s.  They have always been professional with quality service and competitive prices.   They will provide a loaner vehicle if needed.  We even purchased our 2008 SL-550 from John and Ron.  We no longer live in Orange County but, we still drive the 60 miles for service and repair.  Have not found anyone else that we trust.< /Review>

They are theif.I purchased vehicle to export it to my brother in Dubai.They advertised and told me it's white vehicle but after I exported vehicle and spent $3000 towards it I found out it was actually black and they painted white on it to get more money as they know white color has more value in overseas.This exclusive dealership gave me lost of $6000 just because I trusted them.They own repair body shop so be very careful when you buy car from them.< /text>

I recently bought a vehicle (long distance from Ohio) from Exclusive Motors (in Placentia, CA) via the internet.
I worked with John Mattarolo who was amazing throughout the entire process.
>>> The vehicle was e-x-a-c-t-l-y as described - if not better!!!  <<<
They have even done some things for me post-sale (i.e. obtain another set of keys from the previous owner) which speaks to how well they treat their customers / buyer relationships.
I couldn't be more emphatic about how professional and well-run this company is.
Basically, they get my highest recommendation and I'd love to work with them "exclusive-ly" in the future - - - if not for the 35 hour car ride back... ;-)</Review>

Service was good and the food we ordered (green curry, grilled mackerel,  pad thai, crab fried rice, etc.) were delicious and generous. The papaya and mango salads are refreshing start of our dinner.< /text>

The mango salad was the best I have ever had. Fresh, refreshing and the service was wonderfully attentive.  I also had a green curry that was delightful and spicy. I will be going back.< /review>

Horrible. Food made me sick. Threw up once I got home. There were flies all over the place. Served their water on dirty red solo cups. There was dirt in the water. And no AC, table was sticky and peeling.< /Review>

Excellent pad thai and yellow curry! I live in pinole but I can't find any Thai food this good in my neighborhood. It's worth the trip. I was able to go in person before the pandemic and they had live music during lunch. Nice ambiance in person. Consistently delicious this year when I've gotten it to go.</review>

<Text>The Red Curry with vegetables and tofu was excellent. The spicy green beans lacked spice even though spicy was requested and the beams were over cooked. I won’t order that again. Something interesting new was the chicken wings. Unlike the common wing appetizer, the order comes with two stuffed wings, then coated and deep fried. They were good enough that I may reorder them now knowing what to expect.< /Text><username>Julie Niehaus<//username>< pictures>

This is a great Thai restaurant.  Service is good and food was served promptly.  Their red curry was excellent as well as the calamari for appetizer.  We always dropped in here on a way back from SF for some tasty Thai food.  Used to be called Cha Am.< /text>

Great food, but on hot days go early or late because the air conditioning is weak. I have never been disappointed with the food. The Pad Thai is excellent.  The seafood is delicious as well!< /review>

I called to get a to go order at 9:15 and the girl told me they don't take to go orders after 9:00.  So i drove there, arrived at 9:33 and she tells me the kitchen is closed even though the sign on the window says 10:00.

Food and service left much to be desired! Vegetables were obviously frozen and most likely purchased at the dollar store, and they just threw some sauce over this!Not worth the 11$ price per entree!Despite being the only customers we had to routinely hunt down servers! I’ll stick to Benicia or AC for Thai!</review>

I want to take this time to review the wonderful staff here at this specific location. I had a reservation but was not advised that it was first come first served situation. Disappointed that my lot was given away but it's ok...store policies. A week later, not sure what or how everyone handled it but it felt like a Christmas miracle when they called and said they were able to get me a bigger lot and was able to accommodate the original pricing to me. The extra steps to calling and emailing DMs just made my day. I loved how well everyone took care of me, especially Tehya! Glad to be part of the PS family.< /Text>

< Review>
What a great sales representative Devin is he was warm and so so welcoming when I came in to public storage very friendly and what a great smile he has Devin made me feel so comfortable and at ease he explained in detail the contract showed me the unit I had reserved & how to gain access on to the property Devin is the best choice public storage had when they hired him!! Devin is the best kind of person you want to represent your company he deserves a raise with the kind of attitude Devin has making the customer feel important and satisfied I would love to work with him! Devin is a awesome one of a kind guy!! He deserves the 5 Stars + more!!<//Review>

Devin is so great he took his time and made my experience here very great! He showed me the space very nicely and answered all my questions! The storage place is very clean and he is very happy and friendly. I was about to leave because I was unhappy with the price but he’s a good salesman I couldn’t walk away when he offered another space for better price. Thank you Devin!!<//Text>

<text>I don't leave reviews ever but I thought that I should for this storage company. From the looks of the outside you would think it's old, dirty and run down.  But, once you meet the employees and see the inside of the storage place your thoughts change. Didn't see any trash on the property, the employees are seen around picking up trash and washing down the storage doors. I'm impressed. Prices aren't bad either. If you need storage, go and see the Manager Tehya. She will help you. Thank you Public storage for having such great employees.<//text><response>None< /response>< Pics>

I'm a teacher and I just spent 10hrs packing up my classroom for the summer. Being exhausted from packing and needing a storage space ASAP, I was not looking forward to the task of sifting through all the google search results. Finally I decided to just call Public Storage and see what their "$1 first month deal" was really all about. There has to be a catch, right?

I was so wrong. Darryl picked up their central helpline and was professional, friendly, and incredibly helpful. He even found a better deal closer to me. On top of that he's a veteran! If you need help Darryl is your man. Hands down.

The same day, I went to this location and the manager, Felicia, was just as helpful. I was running a bit late due to traffic and she stayed during her lunch break to meet with me. The process was simple and easy. Next thing I knew, I was moving my things in and I was done.

In summary, based on my interactions with Darryl and Felicia, Public Storage is quick, easy, clean, and friendly. I will definitely come here again and recommend this facility.< /Text>

<Text>Overall experience was by far greater than expected. Felicia defines "Excellent Customer Service". Yes, online rates are good but....... then meeting Felicia instills in me the confidence and concern she exhibits. Money can't buy that. I'm now looking into renting another unit! Why not! Felicia's got this! It's what she does. Are we paying her enough? lol She's been there over 5 years now and quite frankly is just getting warmed up. She's seems the type that goes with all this ever changing environment we all live in. Keep up the good work all and hooray for Public Storage-Arcadia.<//Text><rating>5</rating><response>None</response><pics>None<//pics>< Name>

What I like about Lower Azusa / in Arcadia is the curteous and friendly greeting from Devin.
The place is kept clean and organized when I dealt w him.
The only thing I am very concerned about why the top management won't put security cameras in all corridors to protect our units from break ins....my lock was compromised and nearly broken 3 months ago.< /Review><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d9e051c8b4d5:0x2002ec1595d12ae5<//Gmap_id><UserId.>104952789185143116042< /UserId.><pics>None</pics>< Time>

Went in to inquire about renting a space and had a pleasant experience. Emily was patient and was able to answer all of my questions  about rental agreements. I've shopped around and I think this place gave me the best experience. Customer service is important to me since other places have been rude and reps have been inexperienced unable to answer my questions. I appreciated Emily's customer service! Unit was clean and perfect for my needs.<//Review>

Great service at this Public Storage. I made reservations to rent for my mother, both Sandra and Tehya were extremely helpful and patient in explaining the rental process for my mother. I don't normally write reviews, but felt very strongly on the great service I got from both of them, especially when customer service in today's day an age is a lost practice.< /text>

<Text>This is the best Public Storage facility i have found ever. I have been using PS for many years and the staff and manager are the best. The on site staff , the customer service department and the district manager have always been great and taken care of all my problems. The only down side is that they raise the price each year. ( some times a lot ). I would highly recommend this location to everyone.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2d9e051c8b4d5:0x2002ec1595d12ae5</Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><userid>102928388527414076911</userid>< time>

When I went Into to rent a unit, Monique helped me out. She was very knowledgeable and knew exactly what I needed. She helped me save some money and helped me get into the right size unit in which I needed a bigger unit than what I thought. I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing storage.

I was a little early so I was going to wait outside of the office till my brother came but the Manager Tehya invited me to wait inside of the air conditioned office and offered me water.

<review>When I went Into to rent a unit, Monique helped me out. She was very knowledgeable and knew exactly what I needed. She helped me save some money and helped me get into the right size unit in which I needed a bigger unit than what I thought. I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing storage.

We stored most of our belongings here for 6 months.  The staff was great every time we interacted with them (Vicki was there when I got the unit and Teyha was there when we left).  We didn't have any problems and despite being in a very hot part of town, whenever I was there the unit was surprisingly comfortable.  Though I'm hoping not to need storage again, if I do, this is where I'll go.<//Text>

Thank you public storage for having such great customer service reps at this location. Both the managers Tehya and Sandra get you the storage you need at a rate you can afford. If in need of storage this location is the one you want to check out. Ask for one of those managers and guaranteed to leave with a positive attitude.< /review>

The rates at this site are much less than the other sites in the SG Valley areas.  The site also appears to be very secure and clean.  The customer service agent, Felicia, is very efficient and professional.  I was a little disappointed, however, that the first month was not $1 as ostentatiously advertised on the website as the promotion only applied to certain types of units.  Felicia was able to explain the reason well and also pointed out that I still received 50% off of the first month rent---for which I was grateful.</text>

<Review>I rented two units at this Public Storage facility between December 2017 and October 2018, and never got anything less than great customer service. Tehya and Devin are upbeat and friendly, and are excellent representatives for PS. They understand that a storage payment is probably the last and least important bill to pay, and falling behind on payments is commonplace. But... one of the prime directives from PS management is to collect rent ON TIME. It's not easy being PS's customer service rep by day and collections agent by night. But somehow the two of them pull it off, and that is a testament to their professionalism and decency. I've been in and out of that facility over a dozen times since December, and spoken with numerous other renters. All agree that Tehya and Devin "do it, and do it well!"</Review><userid>102276518906714209120<//userid><gmapID>0x80c2d9e051c8b4d5:0x2002ec1595d12ae5< /gmapID><rate>5<//rate></record>

<Text>Came to this storage place three separate times in ONE DAY to open a storage each time nobody was in the office! Later in the day i was able to find a lady in the office named felica,who seemed more interested in her phone and the other lady in the office  who didn't appear to be a public storage worker then helping me find a storage. After i got to see the storage i decided not to rent not so much because of the Facility itself but the bad experience i had just trying to get the storage.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I typically don't write reviews but Sandra and Tehya were a huge help to me in purchasing a storage unit. They made the process super easy and were extremely knowledgeable. The facility itself is really clean and organized, which was really impressive. Thanks Sandra and Tehya!</review>

I started off in Monrovia's Public Storage because I already had a storage unit there but when I was told that I couldn't be prorated, and that I would have to pay the whole cost, if I needed a bigger storage unit. I felt that I was not being handle fairly. However, I was sent over to the Public Storage in Arcadia. Tehya KNEW HER STUFF!!!! She took out time with me and explained everything in detail to me. Although, I ended up with two separate storage units at two different sites. It was worth it because she was nice and she was willing to bend over backwards for the service. She has a great attitude and she keeps the grounds very clean there. I was very tired that day and she was what I needed. I got my storage unit with a smile. Thanks, Tehya!</Text>

i rented 1 storage...i thought i was going to need to need another storage so i rented another very small storage just to put whatever didnt fit in main storage...long story short..i didnt need the storage so i turned it in.. i had it for about 1week 1/2 if not less...l was expecting some of my money to be returned..of course not all of it .BUT..NO...nothing not one penny..the explanation didnt make sense ..i figured since i paid ill just use but again the answer was No..because it had been rented out already ..< /text>

The first time I went to the Public Storage office to ask for information, Felicia was there and she answered all my questions very professionally, I met Ricardo and he was also able to tell me everything that I need to know
My experience was great 5 starts

This is the worst place.  If I could give it negative stars I would.  The people who manage it are the rudest people I’ve ever seen in the customer service industry. I e rented from PS for over 20 years.  I’ll nevsr go back to this hole.</review>

Great wines. We didn’t have a reservation but they were incredibly accommodating. Tyler, our host was extremely knowledge, warm and friendly. We did both tastings and left with their marine layer Pinot and Broken Leg Syrah which were both amazing.

If you’re in the area I highly recommend checking out this tasting room!</text>

They're taking social distancing very seriously, which I very much appreciate. The rose is always on point, and was especially refreshing during the great wave.< /review>

The hipsters have landed in Healdsburg!  Seriously though... there are filaments bulbs and super chill tasting room staff.  Bonus points for getting to sit down and luxuriate in the beautiful space.  (And the wine's good (and affordable) too!)< /Text>

My son as of late dreads his haircut appts,  but the guys at the shop, especially,  Eber, Ruben and Alex provide exemplary service, dedication to their craft and a degree of patience that I could not fathom to find at any other shop. I thank them for all they do and for always giving us an awesome experience. See you guys soon.< /Review><date>1580658284874<//date><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>My old barbershop "closed", so I was referred here by a friend and I'm glad it worked out. Was super nervous about getting a new barber, but I was impressed. The shop was well maintained and the service was great. Ramon definitely hooked it up and I was very happy with the haircut. I booked my next appointment immediately upon leaving the chair. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!</review>< pics>

I was in desperate need of a new hairstyle that didn’t make a 58 year old look like he was trying to be 28 but that was cool for my age.  BRENDA was amazing and so talented.  The whole staff is totally chill and fun to hang out with.  Watch out Brenda I’ll see you in a few weeks<//review>

Great cut by Alex but $36 dollars for a haircut is a bit steep...and that's without a tip..but I did pay on the app.. i guess it's cheaper to pay cash. Only $30..</Text>

Really all of the barbers here are good, but We LOVE Ramon! He does an excellent job with my son's hair and he gives styling tips to help him look on point even after we leave the shop. Thank you for always making time to fit us in, we only come to LA's Finest, because you're the best</review>

This was a good shop. The haircut was great got cut by once Ruben and another time Josh. The price was very good for the cut I recived. Clean shop and friendly workers they are always recognizing and talking with there clients. Love the new style and love how they all work. I would highly recommend this barbershop to everyone I know and will return back to this shop.< /review>

Took my kid here and Chris I think was the barber who butchered his hair and left us really disappointed after getting home and seeing how uneven his hair was. Going back to this over priced place? NOPE!< /review>

< review>
By far the most useless barbershop I’ve been too, that’s what they are. Unfortunately 1 star is the least that is offered. The dork cutting my hair took the time to ask what I wanted then proceeded to do the opposite of what he was instructed. Perhaps a haircut will not be 100% to exactly what the customer wants, but don’t deliberately go against what the paying customer is telling you to do. At the very least display to the customer obedience. LA’s Averages clearly don’t mind doing freestyles on a cut.

How would I rate my hair cut? On a scale 1 to gay I don’t know where to start. On that scoring system their over achievers. I’d be better off going to Super Cuts. Those losers could probably manage to follow simple instructions. At least Susdy Dog pet groomer across the way would give me full service with a better cut than what LA’s Finest has to offer. Mama always said barbers are like a box of chocolates. You never know what hair stylist you’re gonna get.

Make Barbershops Great Again. Vote No On Prop Lame. Help stop your local beauty parlor operators today!

LA’s Finest?? Questionable. Long story short, if you’re looking for a barber who will listen to you and give a good haircut then skip this place. Don’t waste your time. You’re better off looking further...wwwaaayyyyyyy further. Go somewhere where they take their trade seriously.< /review>

<time>1534697583001</time><rate>2<//rate><Review>I paid in advance and then I get their ten minutes before my scheduled appt and I waited 15 minutes and decided to leave because then I wouldn’t make it to my wife’s cousin’s birthday lunch. I called for my refund and never got it.

Another time My wife scheduled the appt and she paid in advance. After my buzz Inwas charged and I tipped generously only to find out from my wife she paid. STILL NO REFUND.

The men here are good at what they do but when I bring my son I would appreciate the barber not talk so much to his co workers or take a beer break because my son is 6 years old and can’t sit for 45min.< /Review>< pics>

My husband was greeted and told he would be next.  As he sat there waiting, several patrons came in and were seated immediately.  After witnessing some of the guys working there going in the back for a beer or three and waiting 30 minutes, he decided to walk out!

Oh yeah, on top of all this, there were 3 guys out front of this place arguing - we won't discuss the profanity used!

I wouldn't recommend this place at all!!!  I wouldn't even give them 1 star, they deserve thumbs down and them some!!!!!</text><userid>105098327026131323214< /userid><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

< review>
Went to try a temporary barber, since my regular barber shop (Suttons) is closed. Walked-in, no appointment and was taken immediately by one of the young barbers. There are several chairs and there was about 5 customers already being served. So I was very happy to be served so quickly. The place is very nicely decorated with plenty of memorabilia and other LA items (I was impressed). A pool table, if you have the time to spend chilling and waiting for a haircut (Very cool). The price was more than I expected or pay at Suttons ($20), but the young barber did a great job! I'm happy, but when SUttons opens up again, I'll be going there. I did tip the barber, so I wasn't a bad first customer.</review>

Louis*with his own beard* was horrible, made calls while cutting my hair and just chatted away. Haircut was a 4 out of 10 and he destroyed my neckline and mustache  after i said keep it natural and NO TRIM. Place is a joke. Acted like he didn't wanna be at work or bothered with cutting hair.  He also made a call to his barber AT ANOTHER BARBER SHOP. + his language was very offensive as he was swearing to his friends and girlfriend on separate calls too.< /review>

This shop is clean classic badass meets gentleman and the way the barbers are dressed the chairs the way each customer looks relaxed enjoying a hot towel a straight edged shave good conversation lots of chrome and leather high end style floors and ceilings stations and even waiting areas look like a place you just want to go hang out with the guys and every single cut shave and clip walks out those barber shop doors a little cooler and sharp clean and perfect. Come hang out play pool have a drink and remember what they say if you hang out in a barber shop you better hope you can get one of these haircuts! Staff is professional informative classy and pleasant everyone is focused on their client none of this talking to other barbers across the shop a gentlemans barber shop for all ages and all genders. LAsFinest they arent joking go peek your head inside easy to find on tye corner of del amo and palo verde nect to 7-11 and the pet vet .</Review>

<Review>Best Breakfast burritos in town. Fully loaded comes with potatoes with chorizo or plain, beans,  scrambled eggs, ham, bacon,  sausage, cheese peppered gravy with your choice of red or green salsa. $8.99 each or buy 3 for $7.99 each. The cooks are very friendly. Don't forget to tip. They deserve it< /Review>< Pics>

This used to be the best place for breakfast burritos but sadly the price/quality changed to a point where it is no longer the best breakfast burrito in town.
People used to brave the shadyness of this area just for the burritos. Currently it sits at $10 and at that price it demands some criticism. One is them is not having all toppings all the time, that is very important because if they are missing a topping or two the price is still $10. If your gonna charge that much you must have all toppings available. Also items like bacon come in clumps which is not the best to bite into.
I don't go nearly as much since the last price increase and when I do go they always seem to be missing something I like. So more burritos for everyone else because I will not be going back.< /Review>< time>

I only go for the loaded breakfast burritos and loaded biscuits n gravy.

However tasty they are and large in size I think nearly $10 for a breakfast burrito is a bit much.

Side note:
They put gravy in the burrito too.
Its so yummy.

<rate>1</rate><review>Put my items on the counter and paid for a $5.00 lottery ticket and the man forgot to give it to me I went immediately back to the counter, (never even left the store) the clerk ( I think he was one of the owners) said no he gave it to me. I showed hime inside my purse and there were some already scratched tickets he said see I gave you the ticket. I tried to show hime they were already scratched to enter the second chance drawing, he wouldn't even look at the tickets. I asked him to count out his drawer so he would know that it wasn't given to me but he refused. I even suggested that I would come back at closing time and wait for him to count everything out and that would prove he didnt give me the ticket but to no avail. He was just convinced I was lying and trying to get over on him. Not only was I very insulted but now I have to drive a lil bit further or give someone that clearly thinks I'm a thief my bussiness which makes me crazy.  Where did manners go?  What happened to the customer is always right? This happened about 4 years ago and it still upsets me. When this survey popped up I felt a small amount of hope that maybe some other people felt disappointed, discouraged and disrespected by the owners of this store..  Thank you, Maria Sund.<//review>< Pictures>

Typical 2-hour wait and while waiting in the huge "no appointment line" the clerk disappeared. I asked someone else who worked there if someone was going to take her place and the rude response I got was "She's on break, we take breaks too"
At my job, when I go on break someone comes to take over for me<//review>

<Text>Only bad thing about this place is the area is soo full of pan handlers. It's annoying and disruptive. Employees are very friendly and quick. Never in line long, even at their busiest hours of the day.< /Text><rating>5<//rating><date>1553657842634</date><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

I've been here a handful of times. The selection of the deli is large but don't expect any deals on the drinks usually when you go to a store they have the larger Gatorades 2 for 3.50 or 2 for 3</text>

< review>
Theres one guy there always says you lost on the lottery tickets but he goes to the back to check it the others dont one time i knew i won but he said i didnt it was a loser and he tries to keep it. I heard no beep when he scanned it on a different machine. He tried doing it to my mother saying she lost not knowing she scanned it already with her phone and plain as day if you look at it, she won. He said she lost and tried to keep the ticket she argued till she got what she won.. i like the store but not him will never go to the store for lottery.</review>

<review>Even in challenging times for travel, this gem still keeps its rock n roll vibe but is super clean and attentive. The restaurant is outside and open, the rooms are pristine, even minibar and remotes are sanitized and wrapped. Plus, most comfortable bed ever. Can’t wait to come back.< /review>< user>

<review>The setting of this hotel is beautiful! It's so lush and green, that you don't even feel like you are in the city. It has a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. The restaurant, Cavatina, is delicious and has wonderful outdoor seating next to running water and tons of greenery! The pool is refreshing!</review>< pics>

Never again. I travel 75% of the year. My first impression was underwhelming but hopeful. DO NOT stay in the main lodge. The hallways are DARK, and the smell is reminiscent of a sewer! I am NOT exaggerating. We immediately requested an upgrade and as a VIP Gold member we are offered an upgrade if available. While a Villa was available they refused to offer it UNLESS we paid an extra $120, over the approximately $500 paid. Additionally, plan to pay a resort fee and parking that will run you about $100 total. The Villas are much nicer but are in SERIOUS need of a remodel and updating. I could go on and on and on but you get the drift. GO SOMEPLACE ELSE!!!!!!< /review>

<Text>I came from Los Angeles, CA for weekend with my extended families. Excellent for its weekend buffet - lots of good with high quality ingredients, and good flavors and cooking!  Much better than Hilton Universal Studios, although less varieties or Chinese dishes!  I prefer Omni any time!</Text>< pics>

Extremely nice and friendly hotel. You feel the rock n roll vibe and it’s amazing. Staff is pier friendly and the rooms are well designed and comfortable and super clean. Really loved staying there with my husband and enjoy the vibe. Totally recommend this beauty!</Text>

This isn’t just a hotel. This is an experience. The staff is amazing and so quiet. The bar is a perfect spot to chill at night and feel like a rock star (dress the part). It’s perfect for small events and people watching (and star gazing 😉).</text>

A jewel in the hills of Hollywood.
There are some hotels that feel alive and tell a story to the guest lucky enough to stay; This is one of those hotels. A journey back into a time when things were fun, a feeling of moving forward and immediately present is displayed upon entering this sleek unpretentious hidden hotel. The professional staff from valet, doorman, reception and housekeeping that always greet you w/a sincere smile - never saccharine.  It's an older hotel that has kept itself clean and polished over the years and has updated itself appropriately, and tastefully. The lush gardens are beautiful and beckon you to stroll before or after a lovely dinner at Cavatina. A wondefully romantic restaurant w/a well thought out wine list.
The cuisine prepared by Luis Morales is fresh, bright and bursting w/subtle nuances and the staff in the restaurant are more than accommodating. There is a levity that is pervasive on the grounds w/an abundance of rock and roll photography and paraphernalia.  This hotel might be in the heart of Hollywood but feels like an oasis w/twinkling fairy lights and a calm hush over a private retreat. The two pools are clean, cool and deep....I'm six foot two inches and despise these kiddie pools so many hotels favor presently. The large absorbent towels provided at poolside is a major plus and a detail often overlooked by many. The limited poolside menu  had options for all types of appetites. My family and I look forward to our return soon. Thank you to the entire staff at the Sunset Marquis, sorry this review is 6 months old but the heartfelt feelings are still on point. A special thanks to Yoman for providing such wonderful hospitality.< /text>

We only stay at the Marquis when we are in LA. Its location just off Sunset in West Hollywood which is perfect for us. Their onsite restaurant is awesome and we love their staff, especially Logan the bellman who is an amazing artist and has worked there for 25+ years. It is such a cute garden sanctuary in the middle of the hustle. Feels like our LA home.<//Text>

The Sunset Marquis has a history that you can be a part of. The Cavatina Restaurant serves fantastic food. Don't be surprised if you run into Hollywood elite and music icons. I won't mention those we ran into here to protect their privacy, which is why they choose to stay at the Sunset Marquis.  Want to impress your significant other? Stay in a villa and experience not only all that I have mentioned, but also the beautifully landscaped grounds. You want high class and privacy at the same time?

<Rating>5<//Rating><Resp>None</Resp><Text>Upon arrival, a valet greeted us warmly. Desk staff were awesome, and they had gift bags waiting for our children in the room. The grounds and hotel are amazing. Concierge was very helpful and the onsite restaurant was good, with good food and service. They will even give you free fish food to feed the koi fish. Only negative thing I can possibly say is that the hotel is somewhat segregated, with areas (and a separate pool) for "VIPs". While they do make you feel like a VIP, it kind of bothered me. Though you can walk right up to the second VIP pool without anyone stopping you.<//Text>< GmapID>

Its gardens - complete with Koi pond and lovely walks, its 2 pools, and its elegant garden restaurant are tucked away on a quiet street that is just steps from all the action of West Hollywood. It felt like being in a resort. Our room was spacious and well- appointed. The bed was super comfortable. The management and staff were welcoming and accommodating.

I only used the spa and poolside service here. I wasn't a hotel guest. But I wouldn't have said it is a "luxiry" property as advertised. Service was pretty bad (I had to follow up for a menu by the pool several tomes and wait even longer). Spa prices were extortionate for the service I got. (Prenatal massage with no pregnancy pillow so I had to lie awkwardly on my side).

The hotel grounds are OK, but a bit worn out and tired looking.

They've got a few things to work on.</Review>

The Marquis is a true LA landmark hotel with a rich history of world renowned artists frequenting the establishment spanning back to the heyday of the likes of Bob Dylan and The Stones, to name a few. First class service is given to all guests, whether you're staying at the hotel or just dropping in to enjoy the excellent food and cocktails. Bungalow-style rooms and suites provide enhanced privacy to go with the wonderfully friendly and proficient service staff.
In short, quaint, tasteful and all class all day in an excellently central West Hollywood location.<//text>

Beautiful hotel with an artistic atmosphere thanks to the guitars, the portraits of the rock'n roll musicians who found haven in thus place.  It is an oasis in the middle of the city of Los Angeles with magnificent luxuriant gardens. There are hidden places with couches where you can read and smoke and relax. It oozes privacy in the different rooms. 2 elegant swimming pools. A great restaurant and a very helpful, welcoming, nice staff.</Review>

It's a fantastic spot for upscale, milinals to  debauch among their peers.
It's also a hotel bar so if you meet someone worth spending some "quality time" with you can get a room.</review>< pics>

This hotel is beautiful and situated in West Hollywood right on the sunset strip. It's calm and quiet, staff are very friendly and unobtrusive, service always timely. The two heated pools are great, we stayed in a pool-side suite and loved it. Minutes way from places like Hollywood Boulevard, The Grove, Beverly Center and other shopping and dining destinations.< /Text>

In villa 31 (So this review is of that villa) which is a nice place to be, though you have to go out to the gardens to feel Los Angeles as the aesthetic of the interior design is  bland. High points are seclusion and the food and the pools. What i don't like is the lack of cohesion of the interior design and the feeling that its a club for anglo rock and rollers.</Review>< Time>

My wife and I spent five nights at Sunset Marquis and we really enjoyed our stay. The hotel room was large, with a really comfy bed and amazing walk in shower. Our room also had a large adjoining balcony, which was useful for afternoon drinks, overlooking the pool, and the occasional afternoon siesta.
We stayed from Monday to Saturday, so the atmosphere at the pool was pretty quiet during the week days and nights, however I assume, based on the Friday night and Saturday morning, that the atmosphere is a lot better on the weekend - perhaps making one's stay even more fun.
There was a slight problem upon check-out, where the valet charged us for three nights, rather than the actual one. (I wonder if this was intentional, to see if we wouldn't notice). However, this was rectified immediately.
The front counter staff were terrific. Our flight out of LA was not til midnight, and checkout was at midday. They took our bags and kept them securely, allowing us to explore the city for the next several hours, and come back and chill by the pool until it was time to go to the airport.
I'd definitely recommend this hotel to couples of families looking to have a fun and relaxing time in West Hollywood. The hotel is beautiful, and the room is comfortable. It is a bit on the pricey side, but hey - it's Hollywood!</review>

Beautiful hotel in the middle of Hollywood that lets you get away from the hustle and bustle. Elegant, but not pretentious or gaudy. The staff is amazing, from the valet and front desk to the bartenders and restaurant. The rooms are generous and have a personal, apartment feel.

< Review>
If you have the means, definitely a cool hotel to check out at least once if you’re into the Hollywood history of their musicians and actors, but at $800-$1000 a night when all is said and done..there’s better value for your dollar. Sidenote: this may be a nitpick but it may help some readers: staff is fine, but don’t expect to treated like you will at most other hotels in the $800-$1,200 per night range. Something just a little off with the staff, couldn’t quite put my finger on it but I guess it just seemed like they were sort of arrogant. It was kinda funny though and to be honest didn’t really care and didn’t impact our enjoyment of the stay.</Review>

This property and the staff are second to none!  We were treated as VIPs in every experience we had at Sunset Marquis.  From arrival, dining room, room service and check out every member of the team was professional, respectful and kind.
The property truly is an oasis in the midst of West Hollywood!  Equally impressive was our Villa!  I would highly recommend Sunset Marquis to anyone staying in LA and I would recommend it as a destination trip if you don't have plans to visit LA anytime soon!< /Text>

<review>One of the best hangout spots and hotels in Hollywood. The restaurant has great food and a wide selection of drinks! Staff is very friendly and service is fast. I've never had any issues here, and I was dwelling here for several months back in 2014! Unforgettable spot.< /review>< username>

Best hotel stay ever. The rooms are modern and comparable to other hotels, but what makes this hotel is the service. It is first class and genuine all the way. From the moment we arrived EVERY person we met - valet, the bell hop, front desk, bartenders, managers, maintenance, room service, poolside service - were all welcoming and helpful, but not in a fake or uppity way. It truly made for a magical stay. The only downside is that this has made my husband and I hotel snobs. WE have stayed at several very high end hotels since then and they simply do not compare. We cant wait to come back. We LOVE the Sunset Marquis. Thank you!<//Text>

Nice hotel but beware of hidden charges. We stayed for 2 nights and weren't aware of breakfast not being included in our package, nor wifi or parking. You are not told this at check in and overall our stay cost us $300 dollars more than we were expecting. It would be fine if you were told. If you are hoping to keep your car there beware the parking costs $40 a night.
The rooms are nice but the above leaves a bad taste at check out - pricing needs to be transparent.< /review>

Te bathroom has lips that glow when the light is off! :) my overall stay was great! I was barely at the hotel because I was out doing the tourists stuff but the decor and vibe were right on point. I absolutely love that they're doing there part to be more green :) it's located in a good area, close to everything. I would definitely come back!<//Text><response>None<//response></record>

Dinner at the Sunset Marquis was wonderful.  As a group of 6 people, we all shared appetizers and enjoyed every one of them.  All plates were empty by the end of the night, and the service was second to none.  The restaurant is quaint, quiet, and beautiful with an abundance of tropical vegetation.< /Text>

I’ve stayed at almost every hotel boutique hotel and resort  in Los Angeles and Palm Springs and this is probly in my top 3 hotels. This place is exquisite with there attention to details I stayed in a bungalow and would recommend you do the same it’s the only way to go. You would never know this beautiful hotel and small jungle was even there it’s sitting in the middle of everything but when inside you feel as secure and secluded as ever. Def recommend staying here.</Review>

< Review>
A very tranquil quiet zen place in the heart of Sunset Strip. You will be whisked away by several things: the beautiful green landscaping, the black and white photographs of the legends of music and acting who have dined or stayed there and the serenity and quiet.

There are numerous comfortable sitting areas throughout the hotel, as well as benches placed in garden areas. It was wonderful to be able to sit and enjoy the beauty of it all, and close my eyes to hear the trickling fountains - without the noise of traffic or other city distractions.

The restaurant, Cavatina, is an indoor outdoor dining establishment. Be sure to check out the photo at the entrance of the restroom - I found it quite humorous :-) Food and service excellent. There is a lounge by the pool and and the entrance (Bar 1200), as well as a small cocktail area at the restaurant. And, there is a spa!

This hotel is not located on main road of this area. It is at the end of cul de sac surrounded by several luxury apartment houses, accordingly a "hidden gem". There is a rich history here; the hotel has undergone a number of changes since 1970s party days, and some of the history is evident by their "wall of fame"! Be sure to check out Morrison Gallery, which has rotating exhibits on various musicians.

I look forward to my next visit! Excellent service, I felt like a VIP from moment I entered to the time I left - worth every dime for the tranquil zen feeling!< /Review>

The staff is here is superb and very friendly. We stayed in a suite for my friend's birthday and arrived to champagne and chocolate covered strawberries flecked with goldv and more. The suite was gorgeous and I spent a more than a few minutes in the bathtub wondering how I could sneak said tub out the door.
I didn't go in the bar, but met a very friendly gentleman outside of it while walking my dog. So if you're single or want to record a hit song at their all-night recording studio, this is the place for you!</text>

Rooms are a good size, pools are quiet and comfortable, the bar up front is great for quiet weeknights and party hardy weekends. The Equinox membership is such a great bonus. Hotel staff are super helpful, and there's just a good crowd overall.</review>

Location wise it is very central to West Hollywood and the Sunset Strip. The hotel is in a great neighborhood. I could not find anything dirty. We did get our money's worth as far as rate goes. I will definitely be staying here the next time I return to LA.< /text>

The staff, location, food, and amenities are incredible.   The staff takes care of your every need.  If it is not at the hotel, they will make sure to get it for you.  It is worth every cent to stay at this remarkable place. I think they should call it a "Resort" instead of hotel!  I've stayed here 3 times and wont stay anywhere else when in LA.
Yes, there are celebrities here....but by the time you check out.....with the way you are treated.....you feel like one yourself!<//Text>

<text>Delicious restaurant, but the rooms need soundproofing. Any door that closed in the corridor echoed through my room, the walls were so thin I could hear everything my neighbors were saying, and the doors kept out none of the hallway conversations. I'd eat there again, but not stay overnight.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2bebc5d279a47:0xf9b14eb420658c35< /gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>102937045050257307855</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

From the start of the trip the service was top notch. Upon arrival the staff was truly friendly and attentive and ALWAYS A SMILE ON THEIR FACE. My wife and I posted up for the weekend in a newly renovated Deluxe Junior Suite. Try the Chateau instead, that is a much classier environment.< /review>

I love the Marquis. Such comfortable beds, such a great vibe, awesome rooms, friendly staff, it has almost everything. The one draw back is that --in 2019 when wifi is free everywhere--they STILL charge you for it. It is ridiculous that a hotel this nice doesn't have wifi included.</Review>

<text>I really don’t get the hype. It’s a place that phones it in every step of the way. The front desk staff never looks up to say hi when you walk in and out and every other detail is just as overlooked. The rooms are totally fine, basic 4 star hotel rooms. The water in the shower changes temperature about every 2 minutes but otherwise there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the dates bathrooms. Facility wise it’s pretty underwhelming.. doesn’t have its own gym, small pool, and very basic little bar. Where it truly fails is in service. Just awful. They call themselves a 4.5 star hotel .. there’s no complimentary water in the rooms and getting what’s in the mini bar refilled takes days, they still charge for WiFi which is rare to see at a hotel of this class these days, and when you put our breakfast menu on the door with a time frame it means nothing to them. This morning they brought  my pot of coffee (and that’s  all I ordered) 20 minutes early therefore waking me up and said it was because they were so busy they wanted to make sure I didn’t have to wait. Why would I have to wait when that’s the point of ordering it the night before.  I would say this place isn about the equivalent to a lower end Marriott.. no attention to detail, not one special factor, and super basic.</text>< pictures>

The staff was amazing and went beyond any expectations I had. You are a very short walk from Sunset Boulevard and the music venues and bars. I can't say enough wonderful things about the Sunset Marquis. I would suggest you stay here should you ever need a get away in West Hollywood.<//text>

I travel frequently and only stay at 4 star or better hotels. I must say we had the most trouble experience staying here. This place and their staff to their guest all seem extremely weird. So if you are not a rock and roll or a movie start reject or a hippie DO NOT stay here. Waste of money.
Ironically when we arrived, I asked the bell guy what does he think about Sunset Marquis. His response. "not sure what to tell you, I guess you have to experience it yourself" I should've known then not to check in.</text>

Waited a long time to check in, until almost 3.30pm and that was despite having pre-alerted the Sunset Marquis of a slightly earlier arrival time.Room ok but carpet absolutely filthy, to the point where I could not walk around barefoot as the carpet left a grimey film on the soles of my feet and blackened them.No service in the tiny bar, restaurant closed very early. Some of the staff borderline on being rude and arrogant. Valet guys and a couple of the girls in reception were kind and friendly though.Received an unwanted wake up call at 4am on my last night. Advised staff of this at check out and they apologised and offered free breakfast but could not take advantage of this due to time constraints.Overall, a very disappointing experience.... Fork out a little extra and stay in a real hotel like the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Beverly Hilton or Chateau Marmont instead.</review>

< Review>
I went over to the Sunset Marquis last night to catch up with some old friends that where in town for a few days from Florida. My friend was very excited that she got her picture taken with Steven Tyler the night before and she told me that I would love the place.

I was on my motorcycle so I didnt have to deal with the valet parking / lack of street parking fiasco that all car drivers have to deal with so I cruised right up and parked up front. I found my friends in the back at the restaurant bar and they started to take me for a tour.

This is a high end rock n roll hotel through and through. There is a recording studio on the facility called NightBird Recording Studios. Some heavy stuff has gone down here at the studios and here are a few artists that have recorded here.

Aerosmith
Billy Idol
Dave Navarro
Elton John
Gene Simmons
George Clinton
Heart
Madonna
Phil Collins
Ozzy Osbourne ... and that is just a few of the names.

I walked around and checked out both of the pools and checked out some of the nice villas. This place is really high end and is within walking distance of the Sunset strip. Very Cool!

We had a few cocktails at the bar downstairs and they played tons of old 70s rock which was awesome and it was loud! The place reaked of Nag Champa which was also a nice touch.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent hotel a short walk from Sunset Boulevard, but placed in a quiet location and just a little tight. Historically, it is the favorite place for rock stars who have started to attend it systematically since the 1960s, starting with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. All rooms are spacious mini suites, overlooking the first of the two pools. The garden also hosts mini villas even more exclusive and eccoglienti. Impeccable service, a quality restaurant in a beautiful setting, polite and friendly staff.

(Original)
Eccellente hotel a due passi dal Sunset Boulevard, ma collocato in una posizione tranquilla e solo di poco defilata. Storicamente, è il locale prediletto dalle rockstar che a partire dagli anni Sessanta hanno iniziato a frequentarlo sistematicamente, a cominciare dai Beatles e dai Rolling Stones. Tutte le camere sono delle spaziose mini suites, affacciate sulla prima delle due piscine. Il giardino poi ospita mini villette ancora più esclusive ed eccoglienti. Servizio impeccabile, un ristorante di qualità in un ambiente stupendo, personale gentile e cordiale.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Sehr freundliches und beflissenes Personal, durchgehend vom Valet parking über Concierge, Empfang wie auch der Zimmerservice bis hin zum Reinigungspersonal. Die Einrichtugen sind gepflegt und sauber. Die Zimmer sind frisch renoviert und modern eingerichtet. Der Pool ist gepflegt und sauber. Wir haben uns in den drei Tagen dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Hotel ist, bezogen auf Zimmer und Lage, sehr preiswert.Das angeschlossene Restaurant ist geschmackvoll eingerichtet und hat eine gute internationale Küche.Insgesamt sehr empfehlenswertes Hotel.

<review>Da uns größere Hotelketten weniger überzeugen können, wir aber dennoch einen zentralen Platz in Los Angeles bewohnen wollten, entschieden wir uns für dieses kleine, sehr gemütliche Hotel im Herzen von West Hollywood. Das Sunset Marquis wird zudem vermehrt als Insidertipp aufgeführt - ein weiterer Grund, der unsere Entscheidung erleicherte. Wir - als shoppingwütige Frauen (wie könnte es auch anders sein :)) und leidenschaftliche Tanzmäuse konnen uns wirklich nicht vorstellen, dass ein Hotel besser für unsere Lieblingsaktivitäten geeignet wäre. Das Hotel liegt im Schnittpunkt der berühmten Shoppingstraßen Rodeo Drive, Melrose Avenue, Robertson Boulevard etc., der zumindest zurzeit beliebtesten Ausgehmöglichkeiten (Hyatt, Teddys, Les Deux, Green Door etc.) - und besten Restaurants (Spago, Dolce, Geisha House, Social, STK etc.) Wer jedoch das süße Strandleben favorisert oder an einem gediegenen Familienurlaub interessiert ist, sollte sich besser andere Gegenden wie Santa Monica oder Malibu aussuchen.</review><response>None</response>< userid>

Es handelt sich definitiv um KEIN Designer-Hotel. Die Gänge zu den Zimmern wirken schon sehr in die Jahre gekommen ... aber sobald man die Zimmertür öffnet, sagt man: Jawohl ! Große, geräumige Zimmer mit Bar, Eiskasten, super bequemem Bett ...Die Bar ist legendär ... einer der Szene-Treffs in Hollywood. Da trinkt man häftg mal ein Glas neben Al Pacino oder ähnlichen Kalibern. In Sunset ist das aber norman. Keiner fragt um ein Autogramm. Der Pool im Innenhof ist sehr gepflegt. Das hoteleigene Restaurant ist eines der besten der Stadt ... hat aber auch seinen Preis ...Bemerkenswert: Auch im ärgsten Trubel der Hochsaison: Wenn man das Sunset Marquis betritt, ist man in einer Oase der Ruhe & Kreativität.Die Hotelmitarbeiter sind extram freundlich & bemüht.Rundum ein Wohlfühlhotel ...< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2bebc5d279a47:0xf9b14eb420658c35< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nous avons séjourné dans les chambres qui sont très spacieuses et qui comportaient chacunes un petit salon. Seul manque à notre avis après 3 semaines de séjours et dhabitudes : il ny avait pas de cafetière, contrairement à tous les autres hôtels ou nous avions séjourné.Lit dappoint également très confortable (ce qui est rare)< /review>< GmapID>

<text>In einer Seitenstraße liegt das Hotel. Es ist sehr versteckt und deswegen ein wenig weg vom Trubel auf dem Sunset und Santa Monica Boulevard. Dennoch ist man zu Fuß in wenigen Minuten mittendrin.Es gibt zwei schöne Pools, eine tolle Bar und ein Restaurant.Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich.<//text>< pictures>

Buena ubicación y habitación. Desde la llegada todo el mundo fue atento. La habitación estaba bien y la piscina pequeña pero tranquila a ultima hora de la tarde. Precio elevado en la linea de West Hollywood.</Review>

Schlecht war es das uns niemand darueber informiert hat selbst in dem Moment als wir an der Rezeption eingecheckt haben wurde dies nicht erwaehnt. Kein WiFi als complimantary und nicht mal eine Kaffeemaschine auf dem Zimmer! Fuer den Zimmerpreis kann man etwas mehr erwarten. Lage des Hotels, der Zugang zu dem sehr schoenen Gym und das Wetter waren ueberragend.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
(Translated by Google) I stayed in this hotel for three days with my grandchildren (teenagers)
We had rooms in the small villas which are extremely nice, very clean, quiet and comfortable
The restaurant is of good quality and the setting very pleasant

Hotel staff are just amazing

Thank you again to them for the very efficient help they gave me when I noticed the day before our departure that I had forgotten the passports in the previous hotel where we were staying near San Diego and allowed us to collect them in the middle of the night .
Thank you also for their kind attention to wish me my birthday

If we go back to Los Angeles ... no doubt we will go back to Sunset Marquis

(Original)
J'ai séjourné dans cet hôtel pendant trois jours avec mes petits-enfants (adolescents)
Nous avions des chambres dans les petites villas qui sont extrêmement agréables , très propres , calmes et confortables
Le restaurant est de bonne qualité et le cadre très agréable

Le personnel de l'hôtel est juste extraordinaire

Encore merci à eux pour l'aide très Efficace qu'ils m'ont apportée lorsque je me suis aperçu la veille de notre départ avoir oublié les passeports dans l'hôtel précédent ou nous résidions près de San Diego et nous avoir permis de les récupérer en pleine nuit .
Ét merci également pour leur délicate attention pour me souhaiter mon anniversaire

Si nous retournons à Los Angeles ... aucun doute nous retournerons au sunset marquis< /review>

<Date>1348012800000<//Date><rating>None< /rating><Text>I enjoyed the stay in Sunset Marquis very much. The perfect hideaway, very calm, but yet in one of the best location in L.A. (West Hollywood), close to Sunset Blvd. I had a two room appt., the furniture wasnt really new, but everything was alright to me. I slept very well in this really cosy King-Bed. The Restaurants offers really good food, on Sunday there is a Brunch. The atmosphere is really like it is described on the Homepage. I definitely had a blast during my stay in L.A., the Sunset Marquis was a part of it. And btw, the staff is absolutely amazing, always friendly, always willing to help and to organise required things. Next time Ill be there again.< /Text>< pics>
