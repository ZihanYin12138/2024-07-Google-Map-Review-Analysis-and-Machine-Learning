We stopped by to try them out and all I can say is. WOW! This place has some of the best beer I’ve tried. We got a sample flight of 8 beers and they were all damn good. We ended up buying a case of beer and couple of small flip top bottles filled to go. We will definitely be going back and bringing some friends to enjoy some beer.</review>

<review>Cool little spot Dark Heart had live music, a food truck, cornhole and a giant connect four. The band was out front so next time I would bring my own chairs just incase (since that seemed liked the pace to be). They also have a back patio, indoor seating and dog area. It was fun to people watch and see everyone enjoying their time laughing and dancing. The food tuck onsite was Ash and Oil. It was pretty delicious. The beers on tap hit the spot. Just a heads up place is tucked away so look for the signage. Also, just a quick heads up the parking is a little tight.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpz1CHq7YyHkoSt3wreWrnly8k-qn_8-in8lT6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1620536488939, 'text': 'Thanks for coming out and your kind review.

<rating>5</rating><review>For being a new brewery these guys certainly have a large variety of beers to pick from. Quite a few IPA options as well as some unique options like a Scottish ale and cream ale. The hazy IPA was solid, but definitely give the Captain Krohn a try, it was delicious! The location isn't the greatest as you can't see it from the street, just look for the sign and go through the gate. It shares a parking lot with a bunch of junk cars unfortunately, so parking may be tight. Once you get inside though the space is nice and cozy with multiple TVs and a convenient popcorn machine. Service is friendly and helpful as well!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpoxufI0ku-a4PIY6mGHKs4_4YLYgLJm3tttn3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIUPkZ8o5GuFzVyOM2IwA-W2FkG_BSC10f1aBk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvloF9ZMS8r_d6t7wzZ69tI2oktrryBPdshQNa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

First time here. Came in for a beer to try it out and check out the place since it's right down the street from me. It's a bit hidden in back, but the place is clean and decorated really nice with a pirate theme.  Beers were pretty good. I had an IPA and pilsner.  Great addition to the neighborhood.</text>

A really fun space; pirate themed with a lot of different social spaces to hang out with friends. The beer is excellent.  We tried four different kinds and enjoyed them all.  They have a few snacks in a cold case so watch for food-trucks or bring your own food if you want. beers are reasonably priced at about $7 each.<//Review>< Pictures>

So my daughter's wanted to take me on a pre Father's day out they wanted to take me to a brewery. I did some research and chose this place due to the raving Yelp reviews. I stepped out to make sure they had dine in due to the pandemic. I noticed a woman with a t-shirt on with their logo, it was safe to assume she worked there. I stepped inside, she was holding a conversation with a couple, as I was standing in plain view, I waited for a break in the conversation. I had to say excuse me twice before she acknowledged me. We went in, went to the counter and the gentleman was very nice and patient as we chose our samplers. Their website said they have food, not true. $5.00 lunchables. There was a Filipino food truck outside that didn't have what we wanted on the menu.  She brought over our order and I tried to talk with her, but she seemed to be in a hurry to get away. There were only 6 people in the establishment. The service from her was not good. With that being said, service is important to me. I will not go there again.< /text>

{'time': 1592865273255, 'text': 'Hi Thomas. I also sorry your experience was not favorable. We are a small local brewery and take great pride in what we do.  I will use your review as a training tool and would love to have you back.. I assume you liked the beer 🙂. I changed the verbiage on our website to be more clear. Let me explain that there was a requirement in stage 2 to serve food. We do not have a kitchen as we are a brewery so the trucks are what we had for food. We will pass along your feedback about your food experience. Going forward we are no longer required to have food service and will offer snacks as  service to our patrons. You are also welcome to bring in your own food to enjoy with a beer. We certainly hope you will give us another try. Recovery for small business during the COVID is a huge deal. Feel free to reach out to me anytime. We’d love to buy you a pint at a future visit. Cynthia Lee'}< /Response>

This place is fantastic!  I'm from WA State where it seems that we have a microbrewery on every corner, and I'm going to say that this is one of my favorites!  They have 3 (I think) options for flights.  I got the 6-sample flight, and I hated none of what I sampled.  The hazy IPA, oatmeal stout, and peanut butter stout were my favorites.  They even offer complimentary vegetable soup!   I don't know if they always have time to do this, but they even came around at one point and offered to refill my water and soup bowl.  I highly recommend this place and might even ask if I can take a growler or two home to Washington.<//Text>

<text>I have visited a dozen different donut shops within a 5 mile radius of my residence and honestly can give this 5 star rating to Steve's Donuts.  There is  a definite highest level of freshness no matter what time of day I go there and the Service and Quality of of all the pastries is head and shoulders above 85% to 90% of all the rest of the shops.  Oh Yes, also the fair prices are above all the other shops around.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Whaaaa? Capone's moved across the way?< /Text>
</record></dataset><record>
<Text>A decent sized plaza with a wide and various range of merchants. From Capone's 🍕 pizza and, not to mention, several other restaurants and eateries to automobile customizing, smoke/vape shops, income tax/notary service, dentist, Allstate insurance agent, and numerous other business establishments. This spot is attractive, organized and tidy.<//Text>< Pictures>

I love Capone's pizza here. Good New York pizza though the doneness of the crust can vary. The homemade lasagne is good and they offer Karl Strauss.

I also like the military surplus here. They have the coolest kite hanging from the ceiling. I forget the lady's name behind the counter but she's super friendly and goes out of her way to assist you.</Text>

Great prices on clothes and improved the wait times on chashies massively, you might not always find what you want or your size, but a lot of good stuff for a price that is hard to beat.<//text>

<Text>I came in here for a pedicure and asked for Van. He greeted me right away and was very professional! He gave just the right pressure massage and also took off the gel and filed and gave me a clear coat on my nails. Definitely a repeat customer in me.💯❤🙌🏽🙌🏽Thank you Van<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCYgS6tbsVWIuERS70sG_tqkBooywKwB6yxY42=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAc3F7FCtCRZzVi70MAPDa6fTY3USZ1Y1SZOh-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><name>Sabrina Lolar<//name>< gmap_id>

I got them done a week ago. Gel polish should last two weeks. This was after I asked her to fix them. I gave up paid almost $80 for my feet and hands to come out looking like this 😔</review>

Tran is amazing and Lena is the best pedicure this side of heaven. Louie is the owner and he has raised the bar for Sacramento nail shops. The commitment to excellent customer service is evident.< /Text>

<review>Me and my daughter in love and her mother went in for an appointment 8/29/20. I got the #1 package with gel for the pedicure. After trying to help diffuse a situation due to overbooking on the salons end, I  was under the impression she would finish my package.I also explained to her that I had been having issues with a callous and asked for it to be filed down more.That did not happen. $58 smh. I was sent over to the male technician for a gel manicure. He cut my skin a few times and when I said I'm bleeding he didn't acknowledge or do anything. This also happened with my daughter- in-love. Her hand has knicks all over it. Two days later,, her hands are hurting and bleeding...looking infected. The job was not professional and it felt like we were being rushed out.. We paid altogether $200.00 The polish on our toes is fine. 8/31/20 Polish on our nails is chipping. The overall service was terrible. If we had more time & didn't have an event to attend I would have asked to have the paint on my hand removed. All in all I think they need more experienced help & better organization.  I am truly disappointed. This was a first time visit for us and was supposed to be a special  treat. This was definitely not worth the amount we paid.</review><Rate>1< /Rate>< pics>

<Review>Worst experience I had to keep asking them to cut skin from cuticle, the lady polished my nails had to remove the Polish three times because it was lumpy, finally another lady came put liquid in Polish so it wouldn't be lumpy, I paid for manicure and pedicure 1 1/2 hours later they told me I had to wait 15 to get manicure because customers had appointments, I had a appointment to and should got complete service, no oil, no lotion used and they raised their prices, no massage chair and you paying the same price and not getting nothing included in service. BEWARE WORST PLACE EVER.....<//Review>< pictures>

I have been coming here for years. Always a fair price, and well worth it. Mindy is the only one I let do my nails, and she's wonderful. Always out within an hour and she has never disappointed me. Love love love Mindy 🖤</text>

<Text>I have been coming to this place for years. They do great work, but do not always offer a great service. Many times I make an appointment, and wait about 30 to 45 minutes to be seen.

Today I came in after previously making an appointment for four people to be seen. Each person was seen about 10 minutes apart, and I was not seen at all, as they were offering to see me at the time my group was almost finished with their service.

Then when I questioned one of the workers I was told "an appointment doesn't mean you're seen at that time, we're busy working."

They obviously DO NOT understand the definition of an appointment. An appointment is exactly that, a set time of a meeting, in this case, a set time for a service.

With that being said, as I was paying for the group service, I spent $150 to have three pedicures, and wasted an hour of my time, and I wasn't even offered a discount.

This is the third and last time I will deal with unprofessional service. Three other customers had the same Terrible Experience today.

There are other nail shops in the area that do just as good of a job, and are better at understanding what an appointment means!!!!

I am just posting this for other customers that don't have time to be wasted!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

I had the most horrible experience and service. I told the nail technician that I was no longer interested in gel polish she refused to listen. She never treated my cuticles. Told me I was dry. The polish was bubbling up on my nails and she said well it’s then polish that’s the problem and would not it until I insisted strongly. My nails are thick and misshapen and not uniformed. They do not look natural. They have dents in them. I brought this to her attention and she said she wasn’t done. I asked her who did her nails I want that same natural look straight from the cuticle as you. She said no you have tips. They did not have all advertised gel polishes. Which was another reason why I stated that I did not want gel polish on my nails multiple times. This was horrible. The pictures speak for themselves. Just got those done less than hour of this post.<//Text>

I am new to gel nails. (4 times) The nail technician used an electric file to remove the gel nails. The Past 3 times The nail technician soaked the nails off. When this was done my nails lasted over 3 weeks. No issues. Keeping the structure of my own nails. In searching the Internet they are supposed to be soaked off, not using and electric file to remove the gel polish. I believe because the technician used the electric file my nails only lasted three days and started  chipping immediately.
I am very disappointed it made me feel like they didn’t care about me only the money they were going to receive and how quickly they could get me out.
I cannot recommend this place.  I need a salon that cares about me and is more concerned about a job well done not their wallet!</review>

<review>SUPER RUDE! I went for a pedi and to fix 2 nails plus bling them out and the guy at the front desk was very rude and immediately told me they don’t have time. I asked when they would have time and he said “never, we don’t fix nails” I then stated I would get a full set and he denied service! The nail techs were staring and mugging/laughing . Yes I’m a black woman who feels discriminated against! Ive been going to Top coat for years !

Have been going there for several years. The service is great and they bend over backwards to get the service "right". I value feeling treasured and important and they not only do me that way, warmly announcing my arrival (with a cute nickname), but they also seem to be alert to and kind to all customers. Is it perfect? No. But it is definitely Top Notch and the name fits. Try Leon or Van for really great "man hand" pedicures, Lena for brows and anyone for nails. Just stop in and watch how they work....very busy and it's because they are truly Tops! Love it!<//text>

If you go for a pedicure, definitely ask for Van. He is so patient and take his time to make sure you have a good visit. He even helped my nieces pick out sparkly nice colors! The women worker that was working on me, seems like she was so in a rush.< /review>

I went for a $30 basic pedicure (walk-in). Sure you can get a $20 one elsewhere but not as sanitary. Top Nail uses disposable bags in the basin. They truly take the time with you, amazing footscrub, massage and cuticle oil process. They treat you like the Queen you are! Even when you don't have an appointment and they're busy - no hesitation and with a smile. (Perhaps $$ is a factor, but you don't feel like you are just a number). If you are one of the frequent customers, you are greeted with a hug and your first name.<//text>

I arrived on time for my appointment, but had to wait over 30 minutes beyond my appointment time. My friend paid extra twice to get cat eye nails but the car eye effect didn't show either time. The nails were just ok and their ability to do designs was minimal.<//review>

<Review>Good customer service! But not coming back. Why? Well.. the women who did my nails was unable to do a good short coffin nail. She had even told me she couldn't. I've gotten this style before, and with the great reviews of this place I figured I'd be a piece of cake. Unfortunately it wasn't. Also the way she cut and filed them, just seemed unprofessional. She also wasn't to great on putting nail polish on. It got on my skin a bit and looks a little bubbly on some nails.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x809b29de502febef:0x3f187dd035b016e5</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I have been coming in for about 6 months. I have never complained before. Today my nails didn't match. Cleo tried telling me my nail beds are different. I liked them and they matched when I came in just need a fill. She agreed to fix them. It is the worked experience in a soon I have ever had. I am in tears. Tomorrow I have to go pay another salon to fix this.< /Text>< Date>

<review>I’ve been going to Kathy for five years now faithfully.  Ive since moved and drive 30 min to see her.  I’ve never complained and tip her well.  Even times that she has someone else do my pedicure I’m ok with it.  Last Friday I had the worst pedicure I ever had in my life. And over charged for it,  So horrible I was speechless but in a hurry to catch my plane to WA.  I took a pic sent it to Kathy and she agreed I would get a redo when I returned.   Today I came in had my pedicure done and was charged another 45 with a 5 discount.  I’m shocked.  They will be losing a long time customer.  I kills me to part ways with Kathy but I feel cheated by the guy that collects the money.<//review><gmapID>0x809b29de502febef:0x3f187dd035b016e5< /gmapID>< Date>

I had been going here for months, but after today, I won't ever go back. I went in when they were almost empty, wanting to get a full set, a fill for my niece and a mani/pedi for my daughter, easily $100. They took my niece, and then made her get up when an appointment walked in, ignored me and my daughter for over an hour, let 4 walk-ins ahead of me and when I asked the employee that took the 4th walk-in if the girl had an appointment before me, she told me to ask someone else and walked away. Never goin back.< /review>

The lady who did my nails didn’t do my nails the original way that I wanted them. Then she over charged for my nails charging 50 dollars just for my nails with no design. After she finished my nails and feet she told me it was 75 dollars. I only had 70 bucks so I used my card. Then she charged my card 90 bucks which really pissed me off. I feel taken advantage of and highly upset.I get my nails done routinely on the regular I know how I like my nails done and I know quality as well. Adding to the fact I never had an experience like this one before. Now I’m out of town 3 days later  now I lost three nails already and a forth one lifting up. My nails haven’t even been done a week!!😡😡 This was my first experience and I will NEVER!!! Go back!!! Over charge and the quality sucked now I have to get a whole new full set out of town😡😡😡. Super inconvenience and a waste of money and time. Don’t waste your money and time ladies.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x809b29de502febef:0x3f187dd035b016e5< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>When I first walked into the salon there was a very nice nail technician trying to deal with a very difficult customer. Unfortunately he had to hand her over to the manager and it turned out it was all over a Groupon on that she wanted to use. I found the whole issue ridiculous what she was saying and decided to stay. The manager came over to me after he was done with her and ask me what service I needed and I requested a shellac manicure. I found all of the staff to be wonderful and professional.   The gal that actually did my nails was very sweet and I really am pleased with her work.  I live in San Diego but the next time I have to up in Sacto I will make sure use Topcoat Nails again.</Review>< date>

< Review>
I'm very disappointed with this place. The lady who gave me a pedicure did a mediocre job. She charged me $45 for a deluxe spa pedicure, but with very minimal foot massage and callus removal which was supposed to be part of the package. She applied nail polish on my toes without having cleaned them properly, the whole time she was just talking.</Review>

I have sadly had to use their service twice. However, I could not ask for better people to assist through such a gut-wrenching time. When that time unfortunately comes, they make the process much easier.</Review>

This is such a lovely and compassionate service. My cat of 15 years died at the emergency vet and when I asked to have him cremated I wasn’t aware he was being sent here. They were extremely kind and thoughtful and you receive a lot more than just a cremation. They made prints of my cats paws and made them into a wooden plaque and they also gave a beautiful urn for his ashes. They also shipped him across country to me because I moved immediately after my cat died. They are extremely affordable and I would definitely recommend.</text>

It’s never easy to say goodbye to a great friend, but when the time comes, I always do it at home in their favorite spot. This was my first time using Hearts and Halos and we couldn’t have been happier. Thank you for helping my Tiny transition. We appreciate you guys.</text>

Thank you Hearts and Halos for the wonderful aftercare that was provided to my baby girl Chonche. From day one staff we’re very kind and understanding. They answered any and all of my questions. Always answered  my calls / emails. My baby girl was returned home to me within a timely manner. And the urn was beautiful along with her paw prints. Thank you so much again! 😊 My family and I truly appreciate it. I definitely recommend Hearts and halos for any needs you may have with your fur babies. They went above and beyond for my baby girl!  🙏🏻❤️<//Text>

<Review>My dog Ladi recently passed from being sick for a few weeks and from old age in general. I took her to Access Specialty Animal Hospital to find out the next step. There was a rep there that explained my choices  on how I would like to handle her aftercare. He was very informative and passionate the aftercare  of animals. I choose to go with aquamation as well as receiving a copy of her paw print. Im very happy with my decision and the staff at the location was very helpful as well with explaining my options of how I would like to receive my dog ashes back through mail or to pick her up. Her urn is perfect and I love her paw print. The compassion from the safe is nothing short of excellent and much appreciated during this rough time. Thank you Hearts and Halos.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>The best experience possible considering the circumstances. My 18 year old cat, my daughter's childhood pet, left with me when she went to college, had reached her end. I was a mess, as it represented the last of her childhood. Amy and her husband were extremely supportive even though a grown man was balling his eyes out in front of them. There was only support and comfort at every stage. She explained everything as it happened and paused for permission before the next step. No surprises or pressure to get it over with. It was painless, professional and loving. Thank you Hearts and Halo's, you gave my kitty the vest possible end to to her very special life.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgSFdRGgY7KqX9Qgvyxy4nXW00bbR-OOMyY9tG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2b72167ea6b5f:0xf7afeb4cae91e6< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Our beloved dog was dying of cancer and we could not bear the thought of bringing him to the vet, literally the most terrifying place in the world to him. They came to our home and helped him pass comfortably and quietly in our backyard in his favorite spot. No stress or discomfort. Devastated for the loss but absolutely forever indebted to them for their help and for allowing him to pass on his terms.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Amy and her husband made this difficult process as easy and comfortable as it could be given the situation. Just like the others, it was time to put my golden retriever down. She absolutely hated the vet (had anti-anxiety medicine, it was that bad), I couldn't imagine putting her through that stress for her last moments on Earth. She was comfortable on her dog bed and with relatively little notice, Dr. Amy showed up and helped ease our girl's pain as quickly as she could.

I am eternally grateful for the service she provided my husband and me (and everyone else). Not only was it better for our dog's sake, but our own. I cannot imagine trying to have to drive home after going through this. You can tell by the way she conducted herself, she has a true love for animals and respect for this process. She actually made me feel better.

I will strongly recommend this service, namely Choice Veterinary Care & Dr. Amy, to every single dog/cat owner I know. Thank you again for everything.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2b72167ea6b5f:0xf7afeb4cae91e6< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>These people helped me with the loss of my cat. Their kindness and empathy made it easier to let my furry kitty go. A wonderful service and filled with compassionate staff who have an understanding and love for animals as much as people. To know that my cat's last moments were at home instead of feeling terrified at a vets office was an immense relief.< /text>< Pictures>

Dr. Michelle was so caring on the phone and Dr. Elizabeth and her assistant were wonderful in home, and made the process as easy as losing your fur baby could be. They were caring, compassionate and let us take all the time we needed. I highly recommend Choice Vets if the time has come to have to put down your dog.< /text>

I would give this fantastically gentle and caring service a 10 out of 5 if I could. When our sweet family dog, Trixie (who was born on Halloween) of 14 years was nearing her end, we wanted her to be comfortable and surrounded by all those who cared. When I called Choice Veterinary Care we were initially greeted by Dr. Michelle, whom was absolutely wonderful and knowledgeable. She had another doctor in the area visit our house within the hour to help us, Dr. Amy; She too was amazing, just so thoughtful, professional and patient.  We loved our dog so much, and seeing her leave this earth with such compassion and humanity....my family and I will never forget it. Thank you from the bottom of our grieving hearts.</review>

<Text>Our family cat had been suffering w/ hyperthyroid and kidney failure for some time.  We had opted out of treating because he was semi-feral and did not take to us sticking tubes down his throat every day.  Instead, we tried to make his life as easy as possible and when he got picky with his food, my mom fed him people food.  However, after a couple of years of this, we got the feeling the end was near as food (even people food) become unappetizing.  We had heard of services which would come to you so you could say goodbye to your pet at home where he/she is most comfortable.  One of the volunteers at Kitten Rescue recommended Choice Veterinary Care.  We had called another place recommended by another vet but Choice seemed to be more informed and knowledgeable.

We are incredibly grateful for the vets at Choice.  We spoke to Dr. Amy at first to discuss our situation and she made us feel comfortable with our choice.  Because the team at Choice are all vets, they all know about the various illnesses afflicting the cats and were very helpful explaining our cat's behavior.  We have known for a while that our cat was not going to get better and we wanted to make sure he had gotten the most quality life possible w/ the least amount of suffering.

Dr. Peter was assigned to us and he was incredible patient...he explained again how our cat's illness had progressed and made us feel comfortable with our situation.  He explained the whole process of how the euthanasia would work.  When the time came to say goodbye, he was so gentle with our cat.  A week after the euthanasia, a member of the Choice Team dropped off our cat's ashes in person.

There is really no easy way to say goodbye to a loved family member but we felt so supported by Choice.  Our goal was to have our family cat suffer the least amount possible and taking him to a vet would have been too cruel and stressful for him.  By the end, our family cat really had the best relationship with my mom so it was hardest for her.  She was just so incredibly grateful for the care provided by Dr. Peter.</Text><resp>None< /resp>< Rating>

I can't imagine not having this service, yesterday we said goodbye to my little companion of 16 years, she was the toughest girl min pin,she was a trooper when she got older  and when she got sick she never gave up her spot in the pack. She saved me when a racoon tried to attack me by jumping in front of me (the racoon was trying to protect her babies), Dr Amy came in a moments notice and helped us through  her transition into doggie heaven, no more medication no more leg and back pain, I am sure she is happy and resting now. Having her transition at home is the best choice you can make for all the love and dedication, companionship this little fur babies give us. I own a pet store and I will sure will recommend her highly to my customers, by the way this is my  4th fur baby she has help me transition in my lifetime. Thank you Dr Amy and your team, you are an Angel!!!

This is such a lovely and compassionate service. My cat of 15 years died at the emergency vet and when I asked to have him cremated I wasn’t aware he was being sent here. They were extremely kind and thoughtful and you receive a lot more than just a cremation. They made prints of my cats paws and made them into a wooden plaque and they also gave a beautiful urn for his ashes. They also shipped him across country to me because I moved immediately after my cat died. They are extremely affordable and I would definitely recommend.< /text>

It’s never easy to say goodbye to a great friend, but when the time comes, I always do it at home in their favorite spot. This was my first time using Hearts and Halos and we couldn’t have been happier. Thank you for helping my Tiny transition. We appreciate you guys.</text>

Thank you Hearts and Halos for the wonderful aftercare that was provided to my baby girl Chonche. From day one staff we’re very kind and understanding. They answered any and all of my questions. Always answered  my calls / emails. My baby girl was returned home to me within a timely manner. And the urn was beautiful along with her paw prints. Thank you so much again! 😊 My family and I truly appreciate it. I definitely recommend Hearts and halos for any needs you may have with your fur babies. They went above and beyond for my baby girl!  🙏🏻❤️< /review>

My dog Ladi recently passed from being sick for a few weeks and from old age in general. I took her to Access Specialty Animal Hospital to find out the next step. There was a rep there that explained my choices  on how I would like to handle her aftercare. He was very informative and passionate the aftercare  of animals. I choose to go with aquamation as well as receiving a copy of her paw print. Im very happy with my decision and the staff at the location was very helpful as well with explaining my options of how I would like to receive my dog ashes back through mail or to pick her up. Her urn is perfect and I love her paw print. The compassion from the safe is nothing short of excellent and much appreciated during this rough time. Thank you Hearts and Halos.</Review>

Dr. Amy and her husband made this difficult process as easy and comfortable as it could be given the situation. Just like the others, it was time to put my golden retriever down. She absolutely hated the vet (had anti-anxiety medicine, it was that bad), I couldn't imagine putting her through that stress for her last moments on Earth. She was comfortable on her dog bed and with relatively little notice, Dr. Amy showed up and helped ease our girl's pain as quickly as she could.

I am eternally grateful for the service she provided my husband and me (and everyone else). Not only was it better for our dog's sake, but our own. I cannot imagine trying to have to drive home after going through this. You can tell by the way she conducted herself, she has a true love for animals and respect for this process. She actually made me feel better.

I will strongly recommend this service, namely Choice Veterinary Care & Dr. Amy, to every single dog/cat owner I know. Thank you again for everything.<//Text>

These people helped me with the loss of my cat. Their kindness and empathy made it easier to let my furry kitty go. A wonderful service and filled with compassionate staff who have an understanding and love for animals as much as people. To know that my cat's last moments were at home instead of feeling terrified at a vets office was an immense relief.</Text>

I would give this fantastically gentle and caring service a 10 out of 5 if I could. When our sweet family dog, Trixie (who was born on Halloween) of 14 years was nearing her end, we wanted her to be comfortable and surrounded by all those who cared. When I called Choice Veterinary Care we were initially greeted by Dr. Michelle, whom was absolutely wonderful and knowledgeable. She had another doctor in the area visit our house within the hour to help us, Dr. Amy; She too was amazing, just so thoughtful, professional and patient.  We loved our dog so much, and seeing her leave this earth with such compassion and humanity....my family and I will never forget it. Thank you from the bottom of our grieving hearts.< /Text>

On behalf of the Friedman Family we’d like to thank you for the wonderful care and compassion you gave our Shelby and to me and my family.  As pet owners we all all know the day will come when we have to say goodbye but nothing can prepare you for that actual day.  We all struggled to find a way to keep Shelby with us and selfishly avoid our heartache.  A special thank you to Dr Sam for the comfort you brought us to accept our decision.  Your emotional assistance during those last few minutes with Shelby were appreciated and in turn made a very difficult day bearable.  Also, thank you to Dr. Amy for all your understanding of the many calls and questions leading up to our decision.</text>

<username>Stephanie Hwang< /username><Date>1533930891501</Date><review>Our family cat had been suffering w/ hyperthyroid and kidney failure for some time.  We had opted out of treating because he was semi-feral and did not take to us sticking tubes down his throat every day.  Instead, we tried to make his life as easy as possible and when he got picky with his food, my mom fed him people food.  However, after a couple of years of this, we got the feeling the end was near as food (even people food) become unappetizing.  We had heard of services which would come to you so you could say goodbye to your pet at home where he/she is most comfortable.  One of the volunteers at Kitten Rescue recommended Choice Veterinary Care.  We had called another place recommended by another vet but Choice seemed to be more informed and knowledgeable.

We are incredibly grateful for the vets at Choice.  We spoke to Dr. Amy at first to discuss our situation and she made us feel comfortable with our choice.  Because the team at Choice are all vets, they all know about the various illnesses afflicting the cats and were very helpful explaining our cat's behavior.  We have known for a while that our cat was not going to get better and we wanted to make sure he had gotten the most quality life possible w/ the least amount of suffering.

Dr. Peter was assigned to us and he was incredible patient...he explained again how our cat's illness had progressed and made us feel comfortable with our situation.  He explained the whole process of how the euthanasia would work.  When the time came to say goodbye, he was so gentle with our cat.  A week after the euthanasia, a member of the Choice Team dropped off our cat's ashes in person.

There is really no easy way to say goodbye to a loved family member but we felt so supported by Choice.  Our goal was to have our family cat suffer the least amount possible and taking him to a vet would have been too cruel and stressful for him.  By the end, our family cat really had the best relationship with my mom so it was hardest for her.  She was just so incredibly grateful for the care provided by Dr. Peter.</review><user>112073930452467247175< /user><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

I can't imagine not having this service, yesterday we said goodbye to my little companion of 16 years, she was the toughest girl min pin,she was a trooper when she got older  and when she got sick she never gave up her spot in the pack. She saved me when a racoon tried to attack me by jumping in front of me (the racoon was trying to protect her babies), Dr Amy came in a moments notice and helped us through  her transition into doggie heaven, no more medication no more leg and back pain, I am sure she is happy and resting now. Having her transition at home is the best choice you can make for all the love and dedication, companionship this little fur babies give us. I own a pet store and I will sure will recommend her highly to my customers, by the way this is my  4th fur baby she has help me transition in my lifetime. Thank you Dr Amy and your team, you are an Angel!!!

<text>One of most favorite wineries. It’s just between Napa and Sonoma so has best of both worlds. It’s pretty good and beautiful but not as crowded as many wineries in Napa.<//text>< pictures>

40$ for a 4 very conservative servings of wine feels a bit like a scam. The server would take her time time talking to all the customers making us quite impatient towards the end. The place has some great views though. I guess those are included in the price tag. The wines tasted  very good. Would recommend to visit once but not more.</text>

<review>This was my 2nd visit to Nicholson Ranch, and it was even better than my first trip. Xander (sp?) was an amazing host, provided us great background into the day's tasting menu, and just a fun guy. Had a blast celebrating Mother's Day! Would highly recommend!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2xRfeuG1ELQClvhWeH8WRCgnk9kgfoYsl7IsQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8085a85ddab4262b:0x7160188790d4c78</gmapID></record>

Terrible service. Our server would spend an extensive amount of time talking to the couple at the table behind us and had no urgency to come pour our next item on the tasting menu. For the last one my husband and I actually had to go inside and tell them we had a lunch reservation to get to and we were still waiting to get our last wine in the tasting. There were only 4 wines, but the tasting took us over an hour and a half. She apologized once for taking so long but then continued to do the same thing. The winery is also situated right off a major road, so the sound of cars and motorcycles really takes away from the serene, tranquil wine country experience. Definitely wouldn't go back. Wine and conservative pours aren't good enough to make it worth it.<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>A delightful vineyard with delicious wines - a favourite spot.

Key greats are their Pinot Noirs and Chardonnay’s, but also that their whole sew toon is organically grown and to the highest standards.

For location, it’s away from commercial districts enough to be peaceful, but close enough to take advantage.  Views over rolling hills and sun soaked vineyards are the perfect backdrop for sipping a bottle of white on a sunny afternoon.< /Text><Time>1619379311076<//Time>< Pictures>

We came here close to closing. The gentleman who helped us was very kind offering insights into the types of wine Nicholson has available as well as food in the area to try. I haven’t been here during the day but friends of mine have. This place is perfect and the scenery is great during the day. We tried multiple wines, all of them were great. I highly recommend this place for a group or a small group of people.<//Text>

<Review>I’ve visited Nicholson Ranch twice (once in 2011 and once in 2019) and had a great experience both times. Friendly staff and delicious Old World style wines.  We showed up just as they were closing this time, unfortunately, but they were kind enough to give us a free pour of their 2013 Pinot Noir and let us wander around the grounds.  Thanks!

1h 10min from SoMa (45 mi)
No Reservations Needed
Open Daily, 10am-6pm

Super nice and knowledgeable staff. The cave tour was great.
The property is gorgeous.
Really unique way of making wine.
The pinot noir was the best by far! But the shyrah was also quite good.
Totally worth stopping by.< /Review>

A beautiful winery, albeit a bit small, as admitted by the family themselves. But the cozy terrace and indoors more than make up for its size.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>The Nicholson Ranch winery is a quaint little winery with beautiful grounds and a very knowledgeable staff. I loved the little greek chapel on the hill and beautiful little pond area for tastings. The patio and personal service was fantastic for our small group, they host large groups both inside and outside as well. The winery survived last year's fires, but the main house had been lost to the fire as was a portion of their vines. You could tell owner Deepak has a passion for wine and his staff are knowledgeable, patient, and entertaining. There is plenty of parking available, we had a great time here.< /text>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>We had an exquisite time at Nicholson Ranch which included tours of the vineyard, the cave cellar, and the wine tasting room.

The wine tasting experience was wonderful with the Pinot Noir and Chardonnay being the best of the lot.

The location of the winery is excellent between Napa and Sonoma, and the views were breathtaking.

Would definitely want to visit here again and would recommend this place to travelers to wine country.<//review>< Pictures>

Thanks to Mike Stone for making the wine tasting experience fantastic! The hospitality was on point even though it was getting to their closing time. Never did we feel like we were rushed! The Merlot was on point, but sadly the price point did not match the taste. Will definitely be back for the overall experience!<//review>< Pics>

<Time>1518622736269</Time><review>I spent 90 minutes here in Feb 2018 with a tour group from a bus.  We visited 3 wineries that day, and this was the best experience of the 3.  The dark-haired lady who greeted us spoke well with good information.  She walked us through one of the vineyards for a few minutes - very enjoyable.  Most of the talking and wine tasting took place outside on a beautiful day, but we did more wine tasting inside the facility, which is lovely and which barely escaped the wildfires of late 2017.  Nice views from these hillsides.  I recommend this place.</review><user_name>Richard Redding< /user_name></record>

Be sure to add this to your wine tour itinerary! The courtyard tasting is a bit expensive at $40 but the experience is lovely - from the relaxing vibe in the courtyard to the excellent staff and of course the wine. Must book in advance for the courtyard or pop in for a tasting at the counter instead.<//Text>

Rude and condescending man with black hair and full facial hair. Rather than being polite he was very comfortable being a jerk. I  will not service wineries that treat service people with rude behavior.</Review>

<Review>We decided to stop by the Nicholson Ranch winery yesterday on our way out of Napa Valley. It was the best decision we made. The property is beautiful. It over looks the vines and is set up high on the hill. We had the chance to sit and chat with Christopher and learned so much as well as had amazing service. We would have spent the entire afternoon there! We love this place and would definitely recommend it and wanted to thank Christopher for his hospitality aswell as the educating of the region. Thank you for being so amazing!
Highly recommend Nicholson Ranch!!!< /Review>< pictures>

I enjoyed the wine tasting and tour of the winery. Our guide was very knowledgeable.  The scenery was beautiful .  The only negative was the $40.00 tasting fee charged to my husband, as he does not drink wine. Had he known that he probably would have opted to remain on the tour bus.</review>

Wonderful white wines that have a hint of pineapple. Red wines are very sweet. Not my style.</review>

<review>It is a shame that poor customer service and lack of follow-up took away from what had been a very positive visit to Nicholson Ranch with its great wine and friendly tour staff. In brief, a talented winery that relies heavily upon mail orders should take the time to follow up with customers, be more careful with customer accounts, and be fully transparent about shipment delays at time of sale. If I hadn't done their job in following up, I would have been charged over $100 for wine I never received.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Name>

Very nice small estate winery producing around 8,000 cases. Located in Sonoma near the Carneros area producing mainly Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs that are natural  without fertilizers and pesticides.
The wine are nice but pricey. The only way to buy their wines is through their wine club or at the winery.<//review>

I suggest doing the more expensive tasting and getting the two extra glasses of wine and enjoying the tasting outside on the patio. Just do it - you won't regret it. That's what we did, or at least half of us did. And while none of the wines blew us away, we enjoyed our time here learning about the wines and the property. We were especially touched that the vineyard was still open even after the owners lost their house on the property.</text>

A great winery experience!  Debbie was attentive, informative, and made our visit so enjoyable...and helped make Nicholson some of my favorite wines.

Nicholson is a welcoming and beautiful winery.<//Review>

My most recent trip was for my honeymoon with my wife.  I visited Nicholson Ranch two other times in my life but every time I went it was a simple and elegant experience.  It wasn't pretentious but the wine was amazing.  I agree that wine is each persons individual experience but I have never liked chardonnay until I tried Nicholson Ranch.  We had a couple cases shipped home to Maine and we order to have it shipped when we run out.  The vineyard is beautiful and the people were wonderful.  I highly recommend visiting this sweet winery and experience the wonderful award winning wines.  I will go bak again.<//text>

<text>LOVE Nicholson Ranch. Gorgeous setting on a hill with a view of Sonoma, and a lake to sit next to as you sip your wines.  Two dogs live at the ranch and love to join you for a pet and a game of fetch. The owner is extremely hospitable and the wines are divine - and come with beautiful bottles.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x8085a85ddab4262b:0x7160188790d4c78</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I went to this place yesterday at the end of the day with Platypus Wine Tours. If you book with this tour company the tasting fees are only $15 instead of the normal $40. This place was the best winery out of the four that we visited. I happen to enjoy Pinot Noir and they have a couple of outstanding ones. My wife also said that the Chardonnay was the best she had all day. The place is beautiful to sit out and enjoy a glass of wine and the tour through the entire winery including the caves below was very informative. I am so happy we got a chance to experience this place. Top spot.<//text>

Beautiful location and good facilities. The wine was much weaker than other wineries in the region and the cost and pouring sizes were also inferior to its plentiful competition. One to miss if your schedule is crammed.<//review>

<review>It was Fri before Memorial.. rainy, dark day which meant business was slow. Only 2 to 3 groups wine tasting in the main room.... and the service was horrible. A lady from Indiana took care of us & for the first 15 minutes she was more concerned with her personal phone!!! Besides that she was dismissive & discourteous. The tastings are pricey & the wine is not even that good. Will never go back.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>My new favorite place in Napa/Sonoma. The setting is pastural and quiet. Lovely views of horses and a llama. Away from the tourism craziness (and we are tourists). The people doing the wine tasting are knowledgable and friendly (Chris was great).  Wine was really good. Highly recommend.<//review>< pictures>

I've brought friends and family, and they too just keep coming back as we can't find anywhere better. The service is exceptional, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable, the buildings and surroundings are gorgeous and there's an amazing laid back vibe throughout. Deepak, the winemaker, is always around to talk with tasters and explain all about their wines. Their dry farmed Pinor Noir's are by far the best I've ever tasted.</text>< Pictures>

The winery was a little routy but it was later in the day and often tour busses take over on the weekends. The offending group was moving on, so we decided to stay for a tasting. We got situated and were carded.

Handing my card back to me and the server said "thank you young lady." I'm 33, young, but older than him and most of people in the room. I have seen waiters try to charm my grandmother by calling her young lady.  I shook off this pale attempt at humor. It would not be notable but he persisted in calling be young lady until the end of the tasting saying it no fewer than 15 times. He then tried to school me about diluting my pallet with water. He said do it between glasses but not sips. I was actually switching wines as we were revisiting Pinots to decide which I would like to purchase.  When he continued to go on about the water, like insisted, I explained this and he reacted "we are here to teach, young lady."

The server was a tool, but the wine - the wine was good. The tastings were over priced, the atmosphere was similar to a frat house. Unless that is what you are going for, I'd skip it.  Or maybe  make a reservation and avoid the self-important former wrestling scholarship holding, Econ major who graduated from Cal. We never exchanged names but he did share a bit about himself with this young lady.<//Text></record>

I will avoid this winery in the future. I am Bay Area resident  and go wine tasting a couple times a year for special occasions. Usually you pay a nominal fee $10 - 20 for a tasting of 5+ wines and there are a few bottles not on the list that are open and the winery would like to share. The staff or wine maker are  excited to tell you about the character of the wine based on where it was grown,  the weather that year, etc.  Tasting fees are often waived with purchase of a bottle --- NOT at this place!

This place felt like a tourist trap. The tasting was $30 for six wines. My wife and I shared one and decided we'd get a bottle if we liked what we tried and see of they would waive the fee. The server was not knowledgable about the wines and smarmy. He seemed to bragging about his scholastic achievement (it was not that impressive). He actually looked at my wife and said "can I teach you something young lady" and told her that she shouldn't drink water between tastings.  She had asked for a oyster cracker or something to clear her pallet and they had none - water was the next best thing. We were trying to decide between the two Pinot Noirs on the list. The server had mixed them up at one point and we were trying to decide which bottle to take.  She was annoyed.

We bought the bottle of the Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir the fee was not waived. I was hoping for a nice romantic treat after visiting an old family  friend in Sonoma, instead I left feeling insulted and hustled.< /text>

Beautiful beautiful grounds. We did the Cave Tasting Tour and I highly recommend it. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable of the history of the place and the whole wine-making process. The wines were my favorite in Sonoma County. We tried a couple Chardonnays, a Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Syrah and I loved them all. Ended up buying a bottle of each the Merlot, Syrah, and Pinot Noir to take home and share with the fam!</text>

<rate>5</rate><text>One of my favorite wineries in Napa and Sonoma. If you like Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, look no further. They have about 12 or so Pinots, and almost every one is delicious. From Carneros, to Russian River, the Sonoma Coast, and more...you can taste the nuances in each. Prices are right too, with no wine costing more than $50.

Friendly staff, and nice convenient location. Stop by this place.</text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very nice little winery. During the tasting, which lasted about 30 minutes, we learned a lot about the winery, the bad fire in 2017 and organic viticulture.
The wines sold are a matter of taste, but definitely very honest and only available on site.

(Original)
Sehr schöne, kleine Weinkellerei. Wir haben während des ca. 30 Minuten dauernden Tastings sehr viel über das Weingut, das schlimme Feuer 2017 und biologischen Weinanbau gelernt.
Die verkauften Weine sind Geschmacksache, aber auf jeden Fall sehr ehrlich und nur vor Ort erhältlich.<//Text>

Not the most luxurious place - just an overall simple and comfortable vibe in a nice neighborhood. Service is great and the prices are good.

By far of my favorite salons! Extremely sweet staff!! Their service is amazing and luxurious. As of right now, they are no longer taking appointments. But I will definitely be coming back as soon as they reopen!</Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>Today I went to try out this nail salon and I was pleasantly surprised with my overall experience here. I've been gone away at college for the past few months and didn't realize this place had just opened. I went in wanting a regular ombré set, but was once I walked into those doors I was shocked.< /Text>< Pictures>

Hands down the worst pedicure and gel manicure I’ve ever received. The ladies were sweet but the polish application was super sloppy and I left noticing bubbles on almost every finger and bubbles and smudges on my toes. Massive waste of $70.</text>

This is my fave mani pedi spot- it’s so cozy and the ladies are so kind and do a great job. Have loved every mani or pedi I have gotten. Great pricing- they almost always have Friends on for you to watch which makes it feel homey!</Text>

Love this spot mostly because it doesn’t smell strongly of polish like many nail salons. It’s clean and professional...and it’s a huge plus that they’re always streaming Friends on the screens.</text>

Great place for a good job done inexpensively.  Not the fanciest but you get what you pay for and this is great quality for the price. You pay for good nails not decor a d champs<//Text>

Nice atmosphere. Clean. Those are what my stars are for but they kept mentioning the tip which I absolutely hate. The paint job wasn’t that great. When they used the nippers it was rough. They didn’t put our sandals on. I have had a lot better pedicures for cheaper in the same area. Wouldn’t recommend.</Text>

Super friendly & loved the work done
They were streaming The Office (my fav comedy) and felt at ease
First time at this salon, I will make sure to add better tip next time since I’ll definitely return!< /text>

They are very attentive.  When they paint the toe nails, they paint the edge as well, which I'm very picky about.  Also, they even checked to make sure my meter wouldn't run out! So friendly!< /text>

< Review>
Did a great job on my nails. They had Friends streaming on the tv which was actually pretty chill. I paid $30 for a mani/pedi and they did a couple mins of a rub on my hands, arms, legs and feet. Wish it was longer but it was much deeper than most other places. They don't have the fancy chairs with the attached soaking tubs or massaging chairs. If my nail polish lasts for more than a couple days then I'll be stoked. Ladies were very nice too.< /Review>

<review>I really enjoy spending a Wednesday early evening here at The Mani Pedi Parlor to wind down from a long work day and after my Core40 workout across the street. The staff here are welcoming and very efficient. Got a usual gel mani and pedi today. Amy did great on my toes. MICHELLE did exceptional work on my gel mani. So clean!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Technicians were friendly and the pedicure was done very well. I came here because I'm visiting my son's family. I'll come back again, with a smile😊.
To address Erin's comment:
1. Not everyone cares enough to talk about you.  They were speaking their native language, mot talking about you.
2. So, they have their own tip policy re cash vs credit.
3. Why should you even need a reminder to tip someone for a service?

Me and my friends came to the mani pedi parlor over the weekend. The experience was so relaxing and comfortable! This is such a unique parlor and I liked that they didn't have those spa chairs that most places have. You get alot for the packages you pay for! Definitely recommend going!!!<//review>

It's nice because here you never have any doubt that these women are talking about you. They faces they make while working on you are unnecessary and rude. They also will forget to ask you for tip but litterally chase you down the street to make you come back to tip. Also, they will accept tip on a card if you are willing to walk out without tipping. It's funny how the rules change here. Overall, average service from some divas.<//Review>

<text>Horrible tip etiquette. I've seen them demand tips on three separate occasions, once from my friend and twice from strangers. They don't accept tips on card, only cash. They have an atm but expecting people to pay 6$ in atm fees just to tip them is greedy and trashy when they could just accept It over card and pay a tiny tiny percentage in fees to the company they accept card payments through.<//text>< resp>

<rate>3< /rate><review>Place is hip and relatively clean. They have individual chairs that added to the decor, but I miss my massage chairs. Their pillow was a bit itchy, but then again I was wearing a linen shirt. I would call it a simple up to-do -date nail salon.

There were only four workers today around the late afternoon on a Monday, not including the receptionist. So as I sat down, I was offered tea, coffee, or water. Nice! Waited for 45 mins before they started on me, not so nice! I really hate places that makes you wait so long especially when you made an appointment. I like to keep my schedule :)

Besides that downfall, the workers there all seem to be working hard as a team. 3/4 workers had done some work on me, which is sort of annoying when it comes to tipping. I want to give it a good tip, but when it's all scattered, the tips are going to be divided among them. Oh well!

They soak your feet in individual bags, which seems cleaner than the regular massage chair tub. I would imagine they change the bag every other customers or so. At least, I hope so!

So who's good or who's not? I didn't get their names, yikes! There were three females and one male. The male didn't work on me. They were all very good with massage and paint. I hate it when they don't clean up the edges or uneven polish, no complaints from me at this salon with those. I would just suggest if you like harder pressure on your massages, let em' know!

Before I end my entry, I want to note that their polish all seems new and in good quality (mostly OPI and Essie). I hate places that keep old nail polish in stock...anyways, hope this helps!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2ba66d035b1af:0xbc85ae7310241f22<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>After driving by this little Nail Salon tucked away on Washington Blvd just West of Bundy
several times I decided to drop by.
I actually live just up the street and make the trek to SM usually for my usual mani pedi fix.
Well no more! This is a great find! the people that work here are genuinely nice.
Whats more the service is professional and they don't rush you in and out while looking at the clock.
There are many services from the usual to all kinds of pampering. I left in heaven after Kevin (I wont go to anyone else any more) did his magic. By the way they also offer a paraffin wax foot treatment that has your feet feeling like silk.
That reminds me I need an appointment...</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Update 8/10/2020 - Updating from 4 star to 5.  I made small comment after picking up order that has wrong selection (white instead of brown rice) on the app, and few days later, owner of the store reached out offering me a free bowl to make up for it.  I'm super impressed and anyone that is willing to handle & care for their business this way deserves a full 5 star!   & of course always yummy food!

I love coming to this place as they have good service and delicious food, fast. But they lose a star because every time I ask for dressing on the side for my salad, I always get a side cup of dressing plus dressing on my salad as well. I think there's a communication issue here LOL<//Review>

This Waba grill is where it’s at.
The costumer service is outstanding & the food is always amazing! This place is basically my 2nd home, I eat here everyday... so does my entire family & we are never disappointed.
Victor is an amazing manager to Waba and does a great job running the place. He is such a hard worker, keeps everything on point & everything immaculate. Victor consistency with the food quality, employees great service &  cleanliness is breathe taking.

I miss Shogun Express, a similar restaurant that I used to eat when I lived in Phoenix. Rice or vegetable base with finely chopped meat topped with a sweet teriyaki sauce and optional hot sauce. My youngest daughter is a big fan, always asks for WaBa whenever I suggest fast food.  I have tried several locations in the Temecula/Murrieta area and recommend them all.</Review>

It's pretty simple: you choose 1 of 3 soups (chicken, hangover, or goat soup)

- Chicken ginseng: a whole small chicken stuffed with rice, root vegetables, dates and herbs; super clean and excellent for someone feeling under the weather.
- Hangover: for the more-adventurous types because it has some chunks of meat, oxblood and tripe in it; great for hangovers
- Goat: my personal favorite, a perfect balance of herbs, spices, vegetables, and gamey meat; great for all occasions but especially winter

I'm happy to see that it's still doing well under covid circumstances and felt safe going the other day when they converted most of the parking lot into an outdoor, socially-distanced, and tented dining setup. Parking might be a bit tough since the restaurant next door (Parks BBQ) always draws a crowd.

You probably won't be able to finish the whole serving of soup since you're also eating rice and delicious banchan (free side dishes), which is awesome since they usually refill your soup when you ask for a takeout box. Despite coming for so many years, nobody ever remembers me, so it feels like everybody's extra nice to me (as an outsider?)

Whenever I leave LA I try to make this a priority on my return. The kind aunties who run the shop are still there, as are the crusty chainsmoking uncles. It feels normal, and that's nice.

Also, their hours might've changed a bit given covid. Not sure but they might be closed by 9?< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhYcmuG4SwXaK7rupjmLQFIcqVIWmOjB4SMFTD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

Ordered Boyangtang on door dash a few days ago, and it tasted great. I went to their restaurant today to try another stew. They don’t do dine in, but they set up a couple of tables outside. Overall, nice people and tasty stews.< /review>

<Date>1591076008904< /Date><Rating>4<//Rating><Review>The 30 minute wait and distance from our South Beach hotel didn't stop our party of 11 from making the trek out to this restaurant in Little Havana. The reviews were so good, we had to add this to our itinerary and we were happily surprised.

We ordered family style and shared several dishes:
Vaca Frita, Ropa Vieja, Fish Soup (we got the last one), Boiled & Fried Yucca, Cevice, Calamari, Paella, Seafood Zarzuela, Tasajo, Fried Pork Chunks and off the children's menu we ordered the chicken strips and spaghetti with marinara sauce.  We also shared a few empanadas from the bakery while we were waiting in line. We didn't have room for desert!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>I'm only giving 4 stars because of the toast and café con leche. Toast hit the spot and was delicious. Right amount of butter and toasted perfectly. I asked for my café con leche to be not too light or dark and with only the sugar from the coffee - they nailed it! Eggs were eggs. I was disappointed with the chicken croquetas & I LOVE chicken croquetas from Versailles. Not sure if it was because I didn't order them at the café window - ventanita. I know crazy. But as I mentioned, I LOVE the chicken croquetas from here and this time it was not what I am used to. Fries were a little soggy but okay.</Review><userid>101353349160997411481<//userid><Time>1591071174702<//Time><username>Marcia Fleming< /username><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

The Short Run Soup w/ dried young naps is a must get! The price is quite decent. The food here is great for a nice cold day. The service was also decent, not the best and not the worst.< /review>

This people are the worst customer service persons.
I understand they don't owe me a smile but Jesus have the decency to treat costumers with education.
Look at them in the eye, don't just take their money.
thank them, for choosing you restaurant because their is many options. These people act like they are giving us free food. not taking my business to you guys hope us races make awareness that they are racist judgmental human beings and we stop consuming.
Look exactly who they hire just their own, they prefer to have difficulties communicating than hiring another race that isn't them.<//text>

Crazy goat dishes. Hangover soup. Bring at least one other person. Boiled goat is delicious, you make little tacos out of sesame leaves. The other goat is also good, ending with them frying rice in the leftovers at your table. For individual portions, get a soup with goat or oxblood for about 12 bucks. There's eel on the menu too but I haven't tried that yet.    Try some weird-ass berry liquor, too, our mikkoli.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The taste of haejangguk is a gem.

It is open 24 hours and drinks are sold until 2 am

Kimchi pork stir-fry seems to need more effort
All other foods are good.

Parking is valet.

김치 돼지고기 볶음은 노력이 더 필요할 듯 하구요
다른 음식들은 모두 좋습니다.

주차는 발렛입니다.<//review>

But today and this time is not good I'm not happy and I will say check your food before you live the place... In this case the avocado 🥑 is not good and looks gross 🤢... Taste bad as well... Hope the owner take care this and be more careful with what they serve... I will give poorly reference<//review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Jugos Vallarta has a wide variety of healthy meals as well as traditional Mexican plates some healthy some not so much. What really makes this place stand out is it's chocomiles (Mexican chocolate shakes) it's almost like the chocolate shakes you buy in Guadalajara Mex. The reason I wrote this review it's because they have quail eggs. If you like milkshakes and never had one with quail eggs then you're. Not sure how to ask for a milk shake in Spanish? Just tell the cashier you want, "un chocomil con huevos de codorniz". I do about 6 eggs they're small but really give the shake a kick in my book.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuz0t47nOvrf0iFGd9DH1zVBhAZ491eSqczEzl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdcUntqfwAbWCH9tlboX0wktir2rMLRS1EgLZY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH9X2wWnsVYfdcoCn13omLXJeR9fKYIIKni7PU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnwNY5oMThrlfhhD4dokbrynni8XFrQ9pRgI2x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbzklkMb_SKrbwgWFzR_y1uZ6CGwOpKi5apYDQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgM1U0SvxqrD1Q2fkCqwq-yDOWau2odyQhBSMP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf-BTKNYwtujjVqzeZPIgUG3oHxtEQkZJbNys9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_-A4HlxF67L9NK62T6mNWCQcaPfAKQRJOaiK8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGVm_9PdGZphP_vwqpFMvYmtnM5j2tnbsTKdCI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeLvhhqKrxd2eVOei4wCOFfo1C1Kb03yjUGcoT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I always come here for the hawaianas.  It's a little pricey but everything is fresh.  My kids like the chocomilk which is expensive so I don't bring  them a lot.< /Text>

<text>I paid for my 12 month subscription and for some odd reason it’s saying I did not pay for it. I don’t understand how I can’t play non of my online games because PlayStation is saying I didn’t pay. Like PlayStation is the worst gaming company. Really PlayStation should shut down there company for good< /text><Date>1622591191195</Date>< Pictures>

PS enrolled me in auto renew for $60 a year without telling me. I found the charge on my card randomly. Literally zero emails, calls, not even a notification in my play station profile. Now I’ve been on hold for 30 minutes, not even an estimated wait time or any assurance that someone will take my call. Just straight to hold music. This feels a lot like a scam. Also: stealing. If this doesn’t get resolved in the next handful of minutes, I’m literally abandoning PS and Sony. Selling my play station. Why patronize a company that clearly doesn’t gaf about their customers or like...being ethical.< /Text>

Was on hold for 15mn or so, was reading the terrible reviews and was pretty nervous to be honest. I had a card issue on my account that I wasn’t able to remove or update, was helped immediately on their end and fixed. Super happy with the outcome, thank you again!<//review>

Thought my issues were resolved and they aren't. I just want my card to be taken off my account that I'm not even able to access and to cancel the whole account. Chat support sucks. First person had me fooled. Probably won't even get a refund. Second person never replied back after about 5 minutes. Good job guys 👏</Text>

I was hacked back in March 2020. I called daily for 2 weeks with no one working due to the pandemic and have continued calling once a week. It’s been OVER A YEAR!!!! I have still yet to speak to anyone. And I cannot cancel the hacked account because they changed the emails and passwords. Still paying for two accounts now because I had to add another so my kids could continue playing. Still waiting to get my stolen information resolved.< /review>

Refuse to work with me to resolve an issue from hacking after being a loyal customer for 12+ years with zero issues of safety or privacy. Lost everything with my account including saved data, games purchased online, and my Psn account. Never had a more heartbreaking time with customer service. Extremely disappointed.
Moral of the story I’m now a newly founded Xbox series x owner and game pass rules.< /text>

Was sent an email that someone had switched my email. Immediately called PlayStation and emailed them back. No answer to either. In the meantime my back account was fraudulently charged $150 dollars before I could shut my card off. Tried to call again sent another email no response from PlayStation. Seems like this is a common problem with PlayStation. Maybe it’s time for a class action lawsuit. At a minimum the next console I buy will not be a PlayStation. Since they clearly don’t give a s**t about their customers.

Update. Got a hold of PlayStation. They basically told me if I report fraud which is what this is they will ban my account. I will be throwing away all 3 of my PlayStations and switching to a console that has better service. PlayStation is trash. I’m very disappointed cause I’ve spent thousands on PlayStation equipment and content. I’ve played it since the original PS as a kid. Whoever is running the show over there needs to be fired.< /Text>

Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Bought a dlc pack that was improperly labeled then refused a refund (description for dlc I bought was actually describing a different dlc) even with a willingness to buy the actual content I wanted. Over 2 hours spent on the phone and accomplished nothing.<//review>

Way too easy for fraudulent charges to be added to kid's account. I am looking at 650.00 in fraudulent charges, and nobody available to resolve. BEWARE OF PLAYSTATION! PROVIDE THEM WITH CREDIT CARD INFO AT YOUR OWN RISK</text>

Playstation cancelled my account almost 2 years ago but they flat out refuse to stop charging my card every month. I have begged them several times to stop but they refuse.  If i could file criminal charges I would.< /Review>

I would give them a zero if I  could. I tried the chat they want you to pay to get help. They are already stealing money from my account and then they ask me to give them my card #. So I call the # just to be told to do it online and be hung up on. Biggest fraud ever.< /Review>

My grandson just got off is ps4 an hour ago and now he is trying to get back on and this is what it says. ( Access to Playstation Network by this account has been permanently suspended due to violations of Playstation Network terms of service and user agreement (ws-37368-7). What up with that he was playing fortnite with his friends.  He did nothing wrong or said nothing wrong!!!!!!!!!! We all should get together and sue them. I've spent a lot on money on Playstations and their stuff.. I bought 3 ps4 for my grandkids. I've bought games online and accessories for the games.  Thanks a lot for NOTHING!!!!!!<//text>

<Review>First of all, my account was locked for almost a  day and I tried to reset my password but they wouldn’t send me an email verification, so due to this I tried to call psn support and guess what, NO ONE ANSWERED, and so the next day I tried calling them again, they answered but I was put on hold, then I got a call from a random number and so I answered, the lady on call described herself as a CSR but she sounded sketchy. She asked for my credentials in order to verify my account and from there I knew it was a scam. Tried calling them again but they didn’t answer. Now my account is currently out of my hands and I can’t do nothing about it. Spent money on you guys to be treated like this? Hell nah I’m switching to Xbox, matter of fact, PC.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I was just trying to request a  refund because I don't play online. I canceled once and was still billed. I tried chatting with the "bot" and kept getting ran in circles. I just tried calling and got hung up on about 4 times after pressing 9 for directory. This is the kind of stuff that happens after you've been scammed. This is ridiculous!<//Text>

Account banned for a chargeback because NO ONE answers the phone and chat is “too busy” due to Covid.  How can you get your money back if they don’t answer the phone or answer chat?  Call your bank and request a chargeback. Wait a minute...as soon as you do that, your account gets banned!   So someone is actually working after all??  Just not in the custoemrs interests.  This makes the nex-gen console decision very easy for me.

This kind of business model went out with the dinosaurs.  So did outsourcing your support to India..one of the rudest cultures around.  Sure, Sony saves a buck using $1 support people, but wow, no support for a multi-billion dollar company? Bad choice.  I’m out..moving on.</Review>

I spent $50 on a game that requires PlayStation plus so I try to buy PlayStation plus but a error keeps popping up. I google a way to fix it but nobody knows how so now I have to get in touch with PlayStation in order to pay more for a game I already bought. And the worse part is PlayStation won’t even answer their phone and they see the issue with PlayStation plus but they still request money and still won’t fix it. Do better if u want somebody to buy a $500 console from u.</text>

<text>THEY DESERVE 0 my son's account was hacked and they told him he had to wait 6 months nothing happened. It's been almost a year. Now they shut down the account for miss use. Thousands of dollars in games lost. No one will do nothing about it. Now when he try to text them they just they ask his account number and they do not respond after that this is bull.
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.
IF YOU SELL DOWNLOADABLE STUFF YOU NEED PPL TO ANSWER CALLS AND HELP THEM GET THE ACCOUNT BACK HE SHOULD NEVER OF LOST HIS PRIME ACCOUNT.<//text>< resp>

I was calling to explain that my console keeps crashing. The CSR hung up on me and since it was after hours I could not get my issue resolved. I will not be buying anymore Sony products. I will either switch to PC or Xbox because this is unacceptable. The issue with my console is not because of something I did and if this is how they do business. I refuse to spend anymore money. The PS5 will not be something I add to my collection after this!< /Review>

So I was banned for 7 days and I called to appeal it and I called and called and they never answered. So I just waited until my ban was done. I did and I played for about 15 minutes and boom, banned again for no reason and this time it’s for 30 days. I called and emailed PlayStation sooo many times and they yet to respond back to me. PlayStation to be honest if your going to have a company, be good at customer service. This makes me want to switch back to Xbox if this keeps happening.</text>

<Text>My account was hacked and unauthorized purchases were made. I disputed them with my bank and the bank conformed it was fraud. PlayStation then suspends my account because they want my money. I am unable to restart any app and can't even get a hold of someone. Perfect timing to renew my PS plus and I cant even use it now. PS sucks.

This is literally the worst customer service I have ever experienced, do not buy PlayStation products. If something goes wrong you’re out of luck because you can’t call customer supports (“we can’t take your call at this time”) and their online chat bot can’t actually do anything helpful. Just an animated QA bot. If I could rate it lower then one star I would. I asked for a call back then an hour later they call back, automated message tells me “we are connecting you with a person” then the call ends.... DONT BUY PLAYSTATION PRODUCTS.</Review>

Called customer support today, very helpful and attentive. She checks back every 2 minutes while I’m on hold. Had my PSVR padding replacement shipped to Hawaii for free, both material and shipping for free.
However took over a month for delivery. And several confusing messages from them during the delivery.</review>

HORRIBLE customer service. This place needs to get a grip. Hire more associates that can answer calls! My sister has a problem with signing into her PSN account. We have called ten times on 10 different days and we receive the same message. “Due to high call volume we are unable to take your call”. Are they taking anyone’s? Love to hear from customer service. But I doubt that will ever happen in my lifetime :)<//review>

Worst customer service ever! You can’t even talk to someone. I used chat and they hung up on me when it is a problem with their system. Absolutely unacceptable!!!!<//Text>

I would give no stars if it was an option! I’ve been trying to get these people on the phone since last week and they say their experiencing heavy call and try later! ALL THIS MONEY PEOPLE PAY FOR THE SYSTEM, GAMES, PSN CARDS ETC AND YOU DON’T HAVE ADEQUATE PHONE LINES TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR CUSTOMERS IS UNACCEPTABLE! I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE PLAYSTATION! YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE LINES ARE TRASH AND OUTRAGEOUS!! 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾<//Review>

Playstation customer support offers the worse customer service ever, they make all this money, yet provide the worse service.  It's a scam. There always extremely busy, no options for a call back number. Call waiting is extensive and they just tell you to go online to resolve your issues and hang up on you. Even the online services through the chat bot are ridiculous and inconvenient.  What a shame.</Review>

This company deserves a -0 or below they banned my son account saying he violated company policy. Someone hacked his account, plus I have pictures showing proof. It saddens me to know they do not care about their customers. I spent a lot of money on this system for them to pocket it only for them to ban my son for some mess he didn't do. This company is a disgrace I will definitely go back to Xbox this is not right at all to take our money. Then they want you to chat instead of talking on the phone this is so unprofessional. I didn't want to give this a star at all because it deserves to poop emoji instead of a star.</text>

Don’t call them. PS is the worst customer service ever. Apparently there is no number for actual help. Waited on hold for 1 hour 27 minutes for the guy to tell me he couldn’t help me, he wouldn’t find anyone to help me and there was nothing he could do. If I couple give them a negative score I’d give it to them.</text>

<Review>Called many times and all I get is "call volume is to high good bye". Is this how playstation treats people now? I remember they use to care and answer peoples calls. They need to get there stuff together and hire people to answer there phones. Online support sucks worse then the calls itself. All you suckers bought playstation 4 and 5 to support them haha.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1609184570662<//Time><rate>1</rate><userid>104648740711484278249<//userid>< gmapID>

The absolute worst customer service. My sons account was hacked and he was locked out due to the hacking. He called 8 times, waited on hold
For hours and when he finally got a representative they were rude and unhelpful. How hard is it to unlocked a locked account due to fraud. My son was the victim and Sony PlayStation is of no help. I even called and was left on hold for an hour. What an embarrassment they should be ashamed of themselves.< /review>

They permanently suspended my account because I fought what I thought was a fraudulent charge because it said other things besides Playstation network, so I disputed it. To which instead of doing the reasonable thing and contact me to see what happened to their payment they acted like little children and suspended my account. I've contacted them for 4 days either by email or by trying to get a live person on the phone to no avail. What I did do was file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and let them run with it. Supposedly now that I paid them they'd better reactivate my account.< /Text>< pictures>

When they disconnect they then block you becuase "they've already helped you"  well ps4 customer service. You didnt help me. Someone hacked my account. They stole from my real bank account and change the phone number on my account so I can't get my account back. I've loved PlayStation products since ps1 and after this ill never buy another one. This is ridiculous.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I feel everyone else's frustration with Playstation, and how they don't really care about their consumer's. They permanently suspended my account because I fought what I thought was a fraudulent charge because it said other things besides Playstation network, so I disputed it. To which instead of doing the reasonable thing and contact me to see what happened to their payment they acted like little children and suspended my account. I've contacted them for 4 days either by email or by trying to get a live person on the phone to no avail. What I did do was file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and let them run with it. Supposedly now that I paid them they'd better reactivate my account.</review>< userid>

Another poor review to the worlds worst customer service.  Playstation and Sony are awful!  It’s virtually impossible to get ahold of anyone via phone.  And their “chat” is a chat bot, who is unable to help with anything.  Do yourself a favor and charge back your playstation console with your bank, and buy an xbox. Sony holds no loyalty to people who live here in the USA.</text>

If I could give it a -5 stars I would. We were banned bc I disputed charges on PSN thru my card company in MARCH when covid hit. We had just purchased a playstation so we would have something to do during quarantine. We haven't been able to play it since the ban and cannot get a hold of customer service or use the chat bot. Completely ridiculous. I have come to loathe this company. It is the WORST customer service!</review>

My account was locked and banned due to someone hacking into it, I called my bank to get myself a new card and the money that was spent back into my account. They banned me for doing so and I. Order to get my account back I had to pay that money back and now I’m going through hell to get access to all of my saved games all the time and money spent o. Created players and all I deserve it back but nobody seems to care about their paying customers I’m about ready to switch to Xbox I don’t hear them complaining not one bit.....WHOSE WITH ME</review>

Just the same as other people my account was hacked and someone bought two games that I would never play. They refused to refund the money for those games, even though i didn’t even purchase those games. There was no phone operators and I got disconnected from the chat I was in because it took to long to type. I feel for all the other people who have experienced this problem, as my account got banned, but they lifted it, then it got banned again for the same reason at the beginning of this virus.<//text>

Trying to get in contact this seems like a last resort. I've tried calling, I've tried the chat but it just ends up telling me to call. My account was hacked with three consecutive payments of around $50. That's not my fault it was hacked, and now im banned ?! I understand the pandemic, but there should be a way to get a hold of someone, I thought people from this company would be able to work from home but it seems not.< /text>

My account has been hacked and this company does not care about me as a customer what so ever. All the money and time I've spent on my account means nothing to this corporate monster. I've been trying for a while now to recover my account while someone else has been on it playing my games. It seems this company has nothing set in place to help protect customer accounts during this pandemic. There is not a single real person i can get in contact with. I go onto their website only to be met with a wall of bots and scripts designed for specific operations that have nothing to do with the issue i have. It says on their support website that they will not have phone operators for another 2-3 weeks. This means the hacker will have my account and bank information for that long as well. I wonder how much damage he will do in that time.</text>

<Text>I'm just wanting to track an order.  Has been over a month.  Unable to connect via phone or online to customer support.   Mind boggling?  Definitely going Microsoft from here on out.  I get it that's a global pandemic.  You would think most reps could work from home.  Embarrassed for Sony.<//Text>< Pics>

Worst support I have ever seen on any website. The limited ways to contact them don’t even work. The phone number you call will tell you it’s currently unavailable and to use the live chat on PlayStation support. You will lose connection to the live chat before it ever connects with someone if you even try. The website is terribly put together and makes it impossible to actually fix your problem.< /Review>

I bought a ps4 for my sons 7th birthday, then i got him a ps plus for 3 months with my debit card, then i downloaded a game called apex because it said it was (key word) "FREE". Now somehow he charged over 300 dollars on my debit card playing this so called Free game. I caught this on my bank account within 2 weeks, i made a complaint to psn and they won't help me or give me any kind of refund at all. I didn't really want to say this either but my son has a learning disability, and he can't read yet, but yet he somehow was able to make these transactions, and now that it's done they won't help me at all, 300 dollars is alot, its not a small amount, now they just keep kicking me out of their chat when I ask for help, and I can't reach anyone by phone either, I wish they would help me it was a an honest mistake, they shouldn't make it so easy to do this even for an adult, not everyone knows every detail about this technology, but we still buy it and pay monthly for this service for what? To be turned away like you're nothing.</text>

Just absolutely pathetic customer service and support. They will literally do nothing when you have an issue. I have issues with my playstation everyday trying to run games, can't get a hold of PlayStation to resolve things. I'm furious and fed up. I spent a lot of money on my games and even got a game drive so the games would run off the game drive instead of the system and it helped but playstation will clearly never resolve theirs fu***** problems. Better to just switch to pc or xbox.<//Review>

<Text>Online support is a joke. I'm trying to change my email and they won't update because I need to remember the serial number to the first console I owned that I set my account on, a ps3 14 years ago.... And the last 4 of a Cc I no longer own. And to top it off their phone service is closed.

Good job Sony.....< /Text>< Pictures>

I went homeless as a veteran for a while. Couldn’t log into old email account because yahoo doesn’t have customer service. Had to set up new account, but when I tried to talk to chat to see if I had to repurchase FFXIV even though it was on my Square Enix account, I was rudely disconnected promptly. Did not hit refresh or anything on my side so it was them. Why have a customer service that has individuals getting paid, which our PlayStation Plus membership is more than likely funding if this is what happens? Maybe they should lower the psn monthly cost if we don’t get the proper service we deserve. Very disappointed in them. I know we are just a number, but to me, this is an escape to help my ptsd after 47 months in Iraq and Afghanistan. Shame on you Sony</text>

Not only was my account hacked but now I CANT EVEN GET A HOLD OF PLAYSTATION! I have looked through their entire website and every number I call either does not work or is answered by a robot telling me that there is nobody available to help me. I go to the website again and the robot tells me I need to actually call someone to help me. Godamnit I love my PlayStation and you wont even help me so that I can play it!</review>

<review>You guys are horrible. You’ve been taking money out of my account for MONTHS!  But I can’t get ahold of anyone on the phone.  You want us to request a refund via the Support Bot but that entire process is dumb.  I answered a series of seven (7) questions just to get redirected to a number that IS NOT IN USE!

I would like my money back.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>My husband's account was hacked so he disputed the charges and was given back the money through his bank! Months later playstation decides to suspend his account because there is an overcharge on fortnite. My husband live chats with them and their only response is that to unsuspend his account he has to pay the $64 that HE DIDNT CHARGE! That's extremely piss poor customer service ESPECIALLY when he can prove he didn't do it! Will NEVER buy another playstation product again!< /Text>< pictures>

The absolute worst customer service I’ve ever encountered in my life. We are being billed on a duplicate account that we cannot cancel.
Is there a consumer protection hot line that can possibly help all of us out that can get after Sony?< /review>

<review>PS4 bricked after the last system update. And they conveniently shut down their telephone support so that you cannot talk with anyone about it. Seems like they did it on purpose to try and sell more units right be the PS5 launch.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Worst experience I ever had. There is literally no way to contact them. Sony no longer offers phone support and the request a chat won't get past the pre chat verification, which I've tried 8 times.  Since I have wasted hours of time reading and watching tutorials that don't answer my question and they prevent me from contacting them I give them Negative 5 Stars, that's (-5). NOTE: you can't post your comment without giving them at least 1 star, but don't let that prerequsite fool you. I also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.< /Review><user_name>thomas legrand< /user_name><resp>None< /resp><Date>1593972365649<//Date><user>107372625090739856199< /user><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

I was banned about a week or two ago of playstation and I’ve already made a new account I understand it’s a world pandemic but you can’t have a decent conversation with the PlayStation bot and they never even help with the problems and I’ve called 20 times in the past week and there staff availability is low so I can’t get anyone on the phone y’all don’t have people working from home!?!?!?</text>

Absolutely a joke with them lately, I use to share the same account with my brother however it’s mine now so I decided to change the email however the verification code was sent to his number and he doesn’t have a line anymore and there is no way of getting the verification code to sign back into psn I’m about to switch to Xbox I understand this whole corona thing but they need to be working at home because clearly they are not and all these reviews show. Just sad how much money spent and they have to take forever. Is it really playstation support? Because it doesn’t seem like it.</text>

Wish I could give 0 stars... been on the phone for over an hr conversation reference number 38908447 spoke to 3 different people including 2 managers, Derrick and Alexis who both told me that to resolve the issue that is Sony’s fault that I have to go out and physically buy stamps and a letter and hand wright a letter to corporate, then Alexis hung up on me, I am completely disgusted with the company that represents the systems I’ve been buying and playing since I was born in 94 and had the first PlayStation. I will NEVER buy another Sony product if you guys cannot help me.< /Review>

Terrible customer support!! Call services are down. Unable to connect to support via live chat. Their twitter account doesnt resolve anything. I used to be such a PlayStation fan now I would never support them again. DO NOT BUY PS5 WHEN IS COMES OUT! I switched to PC gaming and its sooo much better. No more over paying for PS Plus services!</Review>

<Text>It deserves 0 stars this company is trash when it comes to customer service. There is no way I get suspended for nothing. I don't even know why I was suspended. I just wake up one day to see that my account has been suspended. Trash. Horrible services. Even after I try to contact them they have bots responding to me.</Text>< Date>

How can you say your company has customer support when you don’t employ live agents to assist with customer issues. When someone’s network is hacked your company provides no support whatsoever. You only respond to the bank when the charges are disputed. If anyone is reading this please don’t make purchases on the PSN they have very poor cyber security and don’t provide help at all.<//Review>

PlayStation continues to charge my credit card for charges I didn’t authorize. I have called customer support unable to get anyone on the phone they advise to go to their website. I go on the website they won’t connect you to a live chat with an agent only a bot. And when I answer all the questions it says you are reaching the agency outside of normal business hours however, I am not. I am getting very frustrated bc every month being charged 9.99$ for something I don’t use and I can’t cancel or get a refund.<//text>

<review>My PSN account was hacked on Sunday 4/19. My Email and password were changed and fraudulent charges were made on my account. Now I am unable to sign back in to the PSN. I have contacted the PlayStation support live chat at least 40 times now. I have all the information they need. But they tell me they “don’t have access to the account because of security reasons” then who does have access!?!? No one seems to have any answers over there. Someone STOLE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND MY MONEY. THAT IS A CRIME! Who is going to reimburse me for the hundreds of dollars I’ve lost in games. And have no common decency to respond. I know others have had this same problem and no one is helping them either.<//review><Date>1587575128021<//Date><rating>1< /rating>< userid>

< Review>
If I could give negative stars I would. My husband’s account got hacked and charged my credit card $100+. After several days of trying to use the Bot, I created a Twitter account to get ahold of them. The twitter account told me to talk to the live chat, which I couldn’t get through. Then Twitter account ignored MANY messages and tweets. I had to contact my bank and then PlayStation banned my husbands account. Extremely disappointed that they have the worst customer service I have every dealt with. Hopefully their company will make things right when COVID is over, as I have seen many situations where this is happening and PlayStation is just stealing money from people. During a time where people do not have jobs, PlayStation is just money hungry.< /Review>

<review>I’ve been a PlayStation freak ever since I was in high school(I’m in my mid 30s). I bought a PS4 Pro a year ago. I’ve been trying to contact PlayStation for almost 2 weeks. As of 2-3 days ago it went past the 1year marker. So now it’s out of warranty. The PlayStation Pro was a total failure! How does the hard drive die within a year?!

My monthly subscription wasnt extended by two months but I was charged for two months!   Also, I NEVER put my credit card out there online, I use a pre-paid card, and I NEVER turn on auto pay. It is always turned off after every renewal. Yet Sony automatically debited my card!!  Whatever kind of business they are running here, we want no part of it!!!

I got banned for a “inappropriate user Id” when my name is “Wndow_lickr”. And all my games are locked except for the ones I have on disk and the games I pre ordered come out tomorrow and I doubt I’ll be able to play them upon launch now. The phone services are down. I can’t get through live chat because they changed my online Id and won’t let me view my new one because you have to log in to view it. But I can’t log in because my account is banned... worst costumer service ever. I love PlayStation when it works, but it messes up it shouldn’t take weeks to fix.<//Text>

I have tried to call for 3 weeks and was constantly sent to the answering service that told me to call back. Then I tried to reach out to the chat and they told me that for my issues I needed to talk to a live agent. They never gave me a time for an appointment. Today I finally get  to talk to a live person and it was completely pointless. The conclusion of the call was that I have to pay PlayStation money for the money they stole out my account. This is not the first occurrence. They told me it is my fault for having a card on file even though I turned off auto payments multiple times and canceled it from my PlayStation and was still charged again. Also the supervisor was very dismissive and told me to just make a new account even though it is my business account. I have had every PlayStation device and I will never buy from this again. Horrible customer service and no regard for their customers.</Text>

I absolutely love playstation. I had one problem with a game not showing up and I got ahold of someone within minutes and it was fixed in about 15 minutes. The only reason it took more than 45 seconds is because the rep had to collect some of my information. I appreciate every member of the playstation team</text>

My account got banned, and I am not able to access literally a single setting to manage my account, or any other account on my PlayStation. I can’t redownload games I’ve already purchased, and I can’t add psn to my other accounts. This is the worst customer service I’ve ever had to deal with. It’s been 2 months of nothing but an automated call basically telling me to F off. Sony is completely losing their fan base quicker than I’ve ever seen any other company do so. SMD</review>

It appears that there are not any remote policies, systems, nor procedures in place to assist, guide and support customers during this current pandemic. Since last week I have been trying to reach someone besides the inefficient refund bot to discuss two charges to my accoung that I did not make. No one is available and I am still awaiting a refund.< /review>

Absolutely horrible customer support!!  Despicable that they do not allocate enough resources to help those that line their pockets. Disgusting....Luckily mlb the show is open platform next year.  Definitely going with new Xbox.< /review>

Their service is honestly terrible because I keep calling and when I call they just hang up saying their is al lot of people calling instead of just putting me on hold also I get on in the morning and get off and come back about an hour later and my account was permanently suspended for what I did nothing to the game honestly a PS4 is a waste of time and money.< /text>

I contacted them by their chat with a problem. They blamed everything but their equipment or their network and rushed off the line. I’ve scrubbed and deactivated every device until the only thing left was the PlayStation. I contacted my isp and had my router given a new I’d. My up is dynamic and they still blamed everyone else. Then when I tried to get help during when most people are available they are closed on every single way of communication. No twitter response, phone center is closed, and the chat was down. I work for a major corporation that puts our customers first. That is not what PlayStation is doing< /text>

By mistake 2 more payments were added ..knowing that I had already paid my annual fee. I tried to talk to The playstation costumer service to explain what had happened but until the date I could not Conctact anyone, the problem is that I call my bank And they fought the charge that was Charged. Now They came to the conclusion that I actually did the purchase , I accept it well any ways 2 more years play online is ok. But now I. Have neither the service. Nor even 180$$ they took.

<Review>they really don't care at all that my account was stolen from me. I have been trying to recover my account for a week now and they refuse to help me. I have spent years on this account and have thousands of dollars and time put into that account and they're just gonna let someone else steal it.

Play station consul was “not bad” after I bought their year plus membership, a week later I see an unauthorized charge for another membership from Sony, so I ended up calling my banks fraud department, couple Days later Sony send an email my account has been suspended for chargebacks. no customer service whatsoever just bots smh, I’d give them 0 stars if that would be possible. Time to flip the switch to Xbox!< /text>

<text>They’ve been lying for weeks saying their support line is just limited. It’s just a voicemail that has a bot be more honest than the company and admit the line is closed. I’ve been trying to get in touch with support because I’ve tried to sign up with PS Now but it says there’s a ghost PayPal signed in on pc, then on the PS4 it says there’s no payment information but refuses to allow my dad to sign in his PayPal.

PSN refuses to answer the phone I’ve called multiple times everyday at different times each day for the past week yet no answer it’s honestly amazing how terrible the customer service is

Update: I called at the exact time the call center opened and finally they answered but apparently they have a call center just so they can tell you they don’t have the ability to help and you have to do everything online which I had already done and it didn’t work so I’m yet to have my problem solved<//Text>

My son was logged out of his account when we tried to log back in  “incorrect password”. After changing the password now they want 2 part factor code which we are not logged in on any other device so not possible to receive one. I tried to call customer service not available at the moment. online support not available at the moment. So imagine a nine-year-old boy dealing with the covid-19 lockdown and not having access to his account. THANK YOU SONY!!! I was going to buy him the PS5 for Christmas. Now he doesn’t want it anymore.  Xbox here we come!!!!<//Review>

<review>It wouldn’t let me refund a game that I had just purchased last night just because I downloaded it. I wanted to refund the game because I was to young to play it with my friends but I can play it by myself though and I can’t even change my age so I have to wait til I’m 18 in order to play the game so this was a waste of time DONT BUY A PS4 UNLESS YOUR ACCOUNT IS OVER 18 and if it isn’t then your screwed on most things might as well just BUY AN XBOX<//review>< GmapID>

Next thing i know psn sent me a email saying my account is suspended. Never did i had any problems with playstation until this matter. I rather go back to the ps3. At least i wasn't disappointed.

There is no support whatsoever. No one to speak with on the phone, no one to IM over the internet, nothing. This is super frustrating and I will take this into consideration when I purchase my next system. Super disappointing misleading.<//text>

The worse customer service on the planet.  I still don’t understand how they are still operating. Spent hundreds of dollars trying to buy games that later cannot be redeemed.  Cannot connect to anybody online or via phone. The support team is fake. This is a scam!<//text>

< review>
My account has been hacked. The hacker spent over $500 on PSN. I have been trying to contact customer support for days now. To explain the occurring. I notified my bank and card of the issue. And they were able to reemberse me for the hacker money spent. But now I am banned and can't log into the PSN account and customer support is not open or taking calls. I am very displeased with the service and will be contacting customer support again until answered. Then i will file a civil complaint and take them to court if need be.</review>

i’ve tried numerous of times to contact Playstation and Sony and there is no phone support and nobody is returning emails. They automatically charged my account, even though it’s incorrect billing information and the charged was more than what it’s advertised for! Hope your merchant doesn’t mind dealing with chargebacks<//review>

I’ve called Sony multiple times over the course of 2 weeks and they haven’t picked up a call with me once and I’m not able to access my account and some how there are still charges of 60-75 dollars a day off of my card this is straight Robbery Sony loves to steal you’re money but when it comes to customer service they prefer of you just never buy a station again</review>

When I tried the support phone number it kept saying it was closed even though I was calling during normal business hours. PlayStation doesn’t care about supporting their gamers obviously.

The worst by far customer support help. You have live chat support agents that put the customers info in a system to help the customers but the customers already typing there info in the chat. Why don't you make that system available to the customers to use instead? The customers already typing those info them selves. Just waste of time & efforts to get to the point that the agent tells you we can't help you please restart a new chat & when you do you get denied from getting to the chat again</Review>

Support chat is unable to do anything, and the phone lines are shut down due to Covid. An unknown party has full control over my account, including all of its information and permissions.

Billion dollar company. Wont answer any calls, Finally I was able to reach someone from support on chat. Agent ends chat on the final step towards recovering my account, thus leaving me without access to the account I am currently paying for. Additionally, not a single email has gotten through to me, not once in five+ years across multiple account with different email addresses. I have been a playstation fan for most of my life, but the way youve been handling your customers lately is just shameful.< /Text>

They get 0 stars but that wasn’t an option. They changed my online id for no reason at all, then made ME PAY TO CHANGE IT. That should be illegal to change my name then make me pay to change it to something else. Cause they not making money so they gotta go and make money another way by Messing with peoples accounts. I should sue y’all.< /Text>

How do you even get in contact with support? This is the second card we bought that the code has come off and is completely unusable. For as large as you are, you should have a 24 hour support desk.< /text>

Banned my account for disputing an unauthorized charge on my debit card by a different psn. Can’t get into the chat and they shutdown their phone service for, judging by the reviews in here, a few months now. How does a tech company not have teleworkers in their customer service department?<//Review>

The only thing they do on the phone is password reset?? I can do that in 2 seconds from my phone! what do I do when the THIRD dualshock 4 controller ( you know the ones that retail for 64.99?) Starts going bad after 2 months (analog stick drift)? I have gone through 4 of these junky excuses of a controller in less than a year. I don't play call of duty or fortnite the most I've used it is on resident evil 2 and dreams I treat all of my video games so well I don't beat up controllers hell I have an original dualshock that I use on my ps2 all the time and those analog sticks are perfect so what's the deal Sony?<//Review>

<review>So I got playstation+ only so the games I have can update in rest mode. This HAS NEVER HAPPENED ONCE in the several months ive had it!! ALL my settings are correct, so don't even suggest I "connect to internet" blah blah blah... what a waste of money!! I don't buy games or whatever else you can do with playstation+, I just wanted the downloading benefits. Horribly disappointing. Not even going to for a refund,  I'll just suggest to all to not even bother purchasing it. A whole years membership for nothing<//review>< date>

< Review>
Absolutely horrible..

People within the game I am playing are being emboldened by the lack of support and are simply Manufacturing situations that allow them to misuse terms of service by claiming that others are doing the same thing..

ADDITION.. FRI JAN29 2021.

I have recently had my account hacked and within the time the individual had account access they purchased around $130 of AAA content with the linked account/card #..

I never received any notification to change any information on behalf of the account due to the initial intrusion and resulting acquisition of my account..

I contacted PS support and notified them of the hack and the purchased content and regained access through simple steps of verification..

Before ending the phone call I asked the representative what I needed to do to get the illegally purchased content off of my account and that the banking card that was used to purchase the content was canceled to prevent further access and missuse and was told "VERY CONFIDENTLY" that it would be taken care of..

It wasn't..

Its now months after the incident and yesterday night my playstation network account and access to my content ENTIRELY was banned at 4:00 AM without any prior notification or attempts of remediation..

The reason for the ban is that my account was struck for having multiple instances of "Chargebacks" resulting from the cancelation of the bank cards during the unauthorized and "COMPLETELY UNOBSTRUCTED" access of my account which has never been shared or exposed to anyone EVER..

This is negligence..

The fact that I can say I was extorted and then disciplined for that extortion by the mechanism entirely responsible for preventing that initial extortion is completely astonishing and has left me with a fraction of the trust and overall continuity in purchased downloadable content and connecting important financial information within my account to automate subscriptions and quickly aquire developed content..

I refuse to fill out forms or begin petitioning through the methods suggested formally as it would admit or imply guilt of prosses and I am still trying to speak to someone to resolve it..

Im posting this just in case it can be corroborated by other people and potentially linked to a trend as it was right around the holidays and the content was suspiciously focused to blockbuster legacy titles expected to sell over the holiday season..

It is likely the access was granted through exploitation of firmware recently introduced bringing PS5 into the overall ecosystem as the individual was granted access without any of the prerequisite user verification and redundancies that prevent such access..

Regrettably..   a lifetime playstation customer of 20+ years..<//Review>

Bought a game from the PS Store but didn't get a chance to play it until over a month after purchase because I was in the middle of another game which took 250 hours to complete.  Turns out the game had a game breaking bug which wouldn't allow me to get past a certain point.  Called them and they told me to contact the publisher for a work around.  Did that but the company never responded to my email.  Called Sony back and they still wouldn't give refund.  Told them OK you're not going to give me my $16.32 back then I'm not spending another penny with Sony so I want a refund on my current wallet amount...they wouldn't do that either.

My subscription expired they didn’t give me a notice. Plus I can’t access my account what’s so ever due to me not having the same phone number. Their online customer service is the worst because it’s no help what’s so ever on top if that their phones are down!< /Text>

No help at all I forgot my password where I stay auto signed in for years and they know it's my account and still won't help me access so everything I have bought and worked for on my account I've lost just paid 400 dollars for new system and cant sign in to my name have to start all over again and if I can't gain access I'll be returning it for an Xbox if I have to start new there not getting any more of my money because I don't have serial numbers from my first system or an old credit card number I had used there recovery system is a joke</review>

Been trying to get a hold of someone on the phone for 2 weeks now. Never seen a company that promotes their product so much but don’t have a customer support that can satisfy the needs of the ones that put money in their bank accounts.<//Review>

No number to call for refunds. Downloaded a game, it didn't work. Deleted and reinstalled it. Still didn't work. Faulty game. No customer support what so ever.</review>

I was just charged automatically for a year of psn the next day i get a NP-40833-8 error code and can't use psn. Tried everything on their website to fix it and still nothing. And there's basically no customer service. I wish i could give a zero rating.< /review>

<text>No matter what you do to fix a playstation issue there is no solution unless you wait hours. I cant belive they havent fixed some of the bs that is still around. Your section for help fixing issues does not work and has never worked it is utterly pointless. You dont put any valid helpful or reliable information on you consle and dont care about your customer's.

I purchased Mega Man Legacy 2 for $27 without realizing they had Mega Man Legacy 1 and 2 bundle for $19. So I bought Mega Legacy bundle as well assuming that they would refund me $27.

Unfortunately they wouldn't issue me a refund, because they've refunded me in the passed and it was a one time thing. Not only did I speak to the agent, but I also escalated it to the supervisor and manager, and they couldn't do anything. Not even issue me $27 online credit. You can't even sell the game.

I have to say PlayStation has the worst customer service, especially with refunds and my time and money was wasted.  They didn't even have an sympathy towards me for being ripped off. I'm thinking of writing a letter to the head. I'm thinking when new generation counsel gets realised, I might switch over to X-box , PC or Nintendo. Right now I'm very appalled with Sony. I heard X-Box has better customer service and refund policy.

BTW: I would be more than to happy to delete this review if I got my refund.

Thank you<//text>

<Review>My account is most likely hacked and I’m trying to get to the bottom of this issue. Unfortunately it happened on Xmas. They have terrible service and they have no compassion. They say 24/7 support but that’s a lie. I’m going to look into a law suit. They need to be held responsible for their terrible support service.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f9ec3d79b09fb:0x42f17b2ead6b29b9</gmapID></record>

Customer Service is terrible. Can suspend whomever they choose with no explanation or proof of why. No wonder people sue them. They take your money and their servers only work half the time. They need to hire people who actually know how to make networks that function.< /Text>

Your company double charged my account for PlayStation + and when I fought the charges you banned my account! I can’t play any of the games I paid for because of this. Your support isn’t available to assist at all!!! I want to get help with this because now it’s like you have stolen things I have paid for from me< /text>

<text>Unless your Playstation has a warranty, don't send it in to get fixed. Did it 2 times and nothing changed. Very unimpressed. I love the games and the system, but their service center is a joke. Every other experience I have had with Sony has been 5 stars.< /text>< rate>

The worst customer service every experienced. Sent my PS4 to be serviced to get it back still not working. I called to see what was the issue they tell me it was sent back due to a bug not to mention the box my PS4 was in was never opened. Then they say it could of been a bug on the outside if the box due to shipping and it caused them to send my system back without service and they can no longer service the system. This is first class customer robbery to get a customer from under warranty. My system was only played for a week and it stopped working and now they say it's nothing they can do. What makes it even crazier my friend had a system he sent off the week before to get his system back not fixed as well but don't worry this will be my last PlayStation purchase Xbox here I come.</Text>

The worst customer service every experienced. Sent my PS4 to be serviced to get it back still not working. I called to see what was the issue they tell me it was sent back due to a bug not to mention the box my PS4 was in was never opened. Then they say it could of been a bug on the outside if the box due to shipping and it caused them to send my system back without service and they can no longer service the system. This is first class customer robbery to get a customer from under warranty. My system was only played for a week and it stopped working and now they say it's nothing they can do. What makes it even crazier my friend had a system he sent off the week before to get his system back not fixed as well but don't worry this will be my last PlayStation purchase Xbox here I come.<//Review>

<Text>I am outraged at the people at PlayStation because they do not stand by their word. We've been dealing with them for over a week and basically they still will not fix their mistake. How can you hold a 13 yr old accountable for their(PlayStation) mistake. I've never dealt with a company that doesn't put the customers needs first. After speaking to supposedly 3 supervisors we were told you have to fix it yourself. I am so upset right now and I'm seriously considering selling my sons PS4 and going back to Xbox 360 or  Xbox 1 because we had a similiar incident happen with them and they rectified the situation asap and also they realized the mistake was made by a child and we weren't punished for it. I wish there was something more I could do to them but unfortunately one against a corporation is nothing, so please be aware when you call their support line because they don't support.<//Text><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pictures>

Ok. I gotta say something. My playstation is having problems connecting to the home wifi after our power went off then back on. So i called playstation technical support to figure out if there is anything that i couldve done to fix my ps3. Well sadly i didnt get it fixed but was given some insite on how else to possibly fix my problem. I called and was put on the phone with a man name Jairo and he was the nicest support person ive ever talked to. Now the waiting time was kinda sucky but i think it was worth it. We dont see many people now a days that are that kind when it comes to customer frustration. Thank you Jairo for helping me and staying on the phone for 33 minutes lol. Out of 5 stars i give playstation technical support a 1 for waiting time, and a definite 5 star on support operator "Jairo".< /Review>

<time>1494716262183< /time><rating>1< /rating><Text>to put it simply, your customer service is actually horrendous.

it started off surprisingly good, given the negative feedback i've seen EVERYWHERE. i was sent a box to send my PS4 in very quickly. it's been serviced at no cost to me and currently on it's way back.

this is where the problem begins. they failed to attach the tracking number in a stupidly "do not reply" email. it was supposed to have a tracking number because it specifically says "Tracking #: ". but that's just it. there's only a space where it should be. like someone forgot to fill it out.

i contacted them on the phone, and they actually hung up on me. nevermind that, but your reps talk incredibly quiet and muffled it's so hard to understand.

so, through quite a long time of searching i managed to find the live chat link. i made sure it was business hours, and entered all of my info correctly. i simply needed to request my tracking number. yet, it didn't work. the live chat had an error that wouldn't see my PSN ID as an actual id. i know it was spelled correctly because i copied it from the actual website.

after trying for an hour on 2 different devices and getting the same error, along with impossible reps over the phone, i actually made a twitter just to contact someone. they then informed me, "we can't give you your tracking number here. try live chat again." which COMPLETELY ignored me trying to get them to help me with the live chat. nevermind that, but it took TWO HOURS for them to reply with that. i understand there are a lot of people, but to offer zero help is actually ridiculous.

so, why earlier i would have offered a good review because it was good service- i'll have to give only 1 star.

the fact you goons can't even manage to remember to attach a tracking number is sickening. if you don't fix your customer service, soon enough you won't have any customers.</Text>< Pics>

Could not give me information regarding the charges when we have no games purchased on our console but $145.29 in charges which doesn't make sense. We will be selling our console to Gamestop and not purchasing any products ever from Playstation. Customer service is everything!<//review>< Pictures>

Could not give me information regarding the charges when we have no games purchased on our console but $145.29 in charges which doesn't make sense. We will be selling our console to Gamestop and not purchasing any products ever from Playstation. Customer service is everything!</Review>< userid>

<Review>Sony PlayStation demands far to much personal information if you want to register on their website and there is no real way to actually contact them because you get shuttled off to some forum which many game companies are using to derail user input to a rather impotent medium where you do not actually get any company replies or action.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808f9ec3d79b09fb:0x42f17b2ead6b29b9<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Couldn't get in contact with a real human being my friend was supposedly joking and he told some people to block me and when you get blocked you get reported and a certain amount of blocks can get you banned or temporarily banned tried to get in contact but a answering machine said that the employees there were busy so in conclusion I have to wait 3 or 2 days to get back online and play my game when I didn't even do anything to begin with<//text>
