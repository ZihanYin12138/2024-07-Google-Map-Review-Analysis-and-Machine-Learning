<Text>Drinks 20  wait mins, wait staff not knowledgeable about items on menu.    Dinner too long of a wait.

Bottom line good food but you'll wait for ever for food and wait staff sucks. Lack of training,  lack of customer service experience.    Go somewhere else.

Worse than pre- pandemic.   Thunbs down for this reopening.< /Text>< pictures>

Being a ~60 year old and discussing a teenagers back side, who was just trying to do their job, is completely unacceptable and disgusting. We have it all on video with audio.\nNow on to this review, we reviewed this with your server, your host and then reviewing the video and audio and we are bewildered and very frustrated with “your” actions. With bad reviews we always look at them as an opportunity to improve (our track record shows this) but with yours we have to stand our ground. We can’t find a shred of truth to your review. Your first round of drinks came 3 minutes after you ordered them. Your second round of drinks came 5 mins after you ordered them. Your apps came in less than 10 minutes and your entrees came 10 or 15 minutes after you finished your apps. Your server, and you can see in the video, talked with your party multiple minutes, multiple times and your table was laughing and very engaged. You stayed 1 hour and 50 minutes and gave your server an above average tip. And other folks in your party went out of their way to get up and come in and apologize to your server for “your” actions and tell us the food and service were great!\nWe are going to ask you nicely to please remove this review because it is not based in facts! If you feel we are missing something please feel free to contact us at info@pacificbynoru.com, other wise we expect your swift action to remove your review and a public apology.

Wow, so happy to have a great new restaurant in Ventura! We had the charred pumpkin appetizer, steak, sea bass and dessert. All were incredibly tasty and delicious. Can't wait to return and try the beet and goat cheese salad and the salmon. Give this beautiful new place a try!< /Review>

<review>I want to love this place, really, I do. The food is fantastic.

However, it's noisy and the service is uneven. The bartender made a lot of drinks throughout the course of our meal that required shaking a metal cocktail shaker which made it hard for us hear each other over the din (even though we were seated far away from the bar).

The hostess (possibly one of the owners?) was completely underdressed. Specifically she was in a tan dress that was backless and not at all appropriate for a restaurant appealing to the fine dining crowd.

The server neglected to replace our silverware after our appetizer, so we had to fend for ourselves when our hot entree arrived.

All that said, the food is excellent. The service can be improved and I'm sure the hostess can learn to dress appropriately.< /review><resp>{'time': 1566857164396, 'text': 'Hi Marcy,\nWe appreciate the time you have taken to write us. All of this is tangible and actionable. First off, thank you for your compliment about our food. We appreciate you giving us a try and enjoying the food. With regard to the noise, you are not the first to note this and we notice it ourselves when were busy. The building is old and it is made up of a lot of cement, tile and other sound perpetuating materials that are not easily replaced. We are currently researching our options with regard to sound deadening materials and in talks with the landlord for what can be done. Hopefully sooner than later but we have a feeling it will take a bit. And lastly, with regard to our dress code. Our dress code in our handbook sets the guidelines for how our team should dress and the overarching concept is to not be a distraction to our customers. Obviously, we can do and will do better. Thank you again for the compliment and for bringing up these areas for improvement. Maybe on a slower night and or when we do get our sound levels down we can entice you to come in again and give us another try.\n\nUPDATE: We added a ton of sound deadening "clouds" on the ceiling and its noticeably reduced the noise.\n\nKind regards,\nThe Pacific by NoRu Team'}<//resp>< date>

<Review>Most of you would have this as 5 ⭐'s but nobody is perfect!

Went looking for cheesecake within walking distance of downtown Ventura (surprisingly this is the only restaurant around where we could find cheesecake, but it wasn't listed on Google). Well we weren't disappointed, some mighty fine cheesecake with mildly tart sauce to compliment the sweetness of the cheesecake.

We set outside at the double couch and table near enough to the overhead heater to chase the chill but not be overwhelmed by the heat. It was 7-7:30 on a Wednesday evening so the street scene was active but not overwhelming.

We enjoyed the cheesecake and the restaurant. I would come again.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Time>1556204198254</Time>< user_name>

<Review>Took my husband to Ventura for a staycation for our anniversary.    Chose this restaurant based on location and reviews both here and google.   Very cute heated patio area when we arrived.   Hostess immediately acknowledged us and we had our table within minutes (had a reservation)   We had water as soon as we sat down.   The server came by quickly and took our drink order, appetizer order.   We had the bread plate appetizer which was super yummy.   My Passionfruit Mojito was also delicious.   I ordered the Sake Glazed Salmon and hubster had the Wagu Flatiron Bulgogi.   Both were excellent!!    My only wish was that the server was more engaging - barely spoke 2 words and certainly didnt enhance our visit as we saw others doing.   She was efficient however.    I would go again.</Review>< UserId.>

< Review>
In short I don't recommend.
We got our table very quickly. The service was friendly but they were really clueless.
We ordered 2 beers (beers were good), 1 glass of wine (which was a cheap wine) and 1 Ginger lemonade (6 bucks for a lemonade that was just regular lemonade without ginger). We also ordered 3 appetizers and 4 entrees.
After about 30 minutes, we got one appetizer. Then after 20 more minutes we got the second and after another 10 minutes we got the last appetizer. To get our drinks we had to ask for them 4 times. Drinks finally came after we were done with the appetizers. The entrees came after another 15 minutes or so... they only brought 2 of them. It took them about 25 more minutes to come and say that they were out of meat! We are talking more than 45 minutes after we ordered!
Food was not as terrible as the service. The New York strip was just ok, but definitely not worth 33 dollars. The chicken was too salty. The garlic bread and the fig tapenade were good.
In general the servers had smiles in their faces but they had no clue what they were doing. Food was delayed and finally they did not have one item after a long long wait. Worst part is the food is not good enough to compensate for the appalling service.
We wont come back.< /Review>

We can only say sorry and tell you we have reviewed our processes and we are tuning them as we write this message to get better. We are also working with our purveyors to avoid this in the future by making sure we have everything we need to be successful.

Kevin Jewlers is THE premier location for jewelry shopping! Verna at the Carlsbad location helped me, and her willingness to patiently work with me as I shopped, matched by her friendliness and overall knowledge, makes her stand out; she is incredible! Furthermore, Fidel and Karen who worked at the location were incredibly friendly, and by the time I walked out with a new ring for my wife, I felt like I was a part of the Kevin Jewlers family. This store and their employees understand customer service, and I will happily shop here again and recommend all others to do the same!</review>

Kevin Jewelers always exceeded my expectation from providing excellent customer service to giving the best prices in town. Thanks to Verna who assisted me well, super friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. I am so happy with my purchase, figaro necklace and cross pendant, I would highly recommend Kevin at Carlsbad Outlet if you're looking for any jewelries and a lot more. Look for Verna! Again, thank you so much and see you next time. By the way, this place certainly practice covid19 precautions, another plus to shop!< /Review>

We stopped by the store only to look around but Verna was so friendly and helpful that we ended up buying several items. We received great deals and services from both employees present at the store, as Verna was helping us with sales Nick, the other employee helped us with our jewelry cleaning. We come from out of town but we will definitely come back to this place. We have been Kevin Jewelry’s customers for almost 15 years and this was honestly the best customer service experience ever. Again Thank you Verna and Nick for providing a great customer service and for going above and beyond our expectations!!< /text>

Amazing people that works there! Was helped out by Alec and Karen from the store to find the watch that I wanted. Also they were able to give me a great price for the watch that I really love! Left the store a happy man indeed! A great watch at a great price! It literally was one of the best days of my trip in the U.S.< /review>

Excellent customer service from Verna Shannon, I checked out a gold necklace but wasn’t too sure so left and came back the next day and Verna remembered exactly what I was looking for and had it ready in minutes. Overall great service with her and the staff. Will definitely buy again from here 👍🏼<//Text>

Didn’t expect to buy anything when I walked into the store. But I left with a beautiful ring. The customer service was amazing. The girl who helped me wasn’t high pressure demanding I leave with something like other stores I’ve been in, but still continued to show me beautiful jewelry which I really enjoyed.

Love the staff, very nice and helpful. He is the one that ask me , if I buy 2 watches , he will ask the boss for better discount. I saw him talk to the boss and they both come out see me with the price . I told them yes I’ll buy it . And when they go do paper work for me. The boss now find out he a little under quoted me and he said he can’t sell for me that price . The boss even trying to lie to me that he call in to talk to the owner and the owner tell him no. BIG LIE , would never recommend anyone to this store!!!!!!!!!</review>

<review>Absolutely loved this place! Great prices for amazing jewelry! We were treated and helped very well. Casey Parker was very helpful with welcoming us into the store and getting us started looking for a wedding ring. He took his time helping us find the perfect ring that best suited me. Once we found the right ring, Alec, the manager, helped us look into prices and basically with the entire purchasing process. Overall great store, great prices, and best of all amazing people.

Thank you to Alec and Casey who were extremely helpful - I wanted to give my mom a meaningful birthday gift and they helped make it happen. In addition, I came back two times for additional assistance and they took the time to answer my questions.<//Review>< pics>

<text>The sales lady and branch manager at the Carlsbad branch went out of their way to get me the best deal.
It is a rarity that I give a store a 5 star rating but this one deserves it. No pressure, no gimmicks and excellent customer service.
This will be the only branch I will visit for all my jewelry needs.

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>A complete waste of my time.  I stopped by this shop during my vacation to see a watch since my husband promised me one for my birthday.  We currently live in Singapore and are on holiday in So Cal for the week.   They asked for my identification, so I handed them my valid NYS drivers license.  The sales associate took it behind the counter and showed the security guard who told me that they needed a California state drivers license to show me the watch. I I was flabbergasted.  I have never lived in CA so do not and have never had a CA drivers license.  Don’t shop there unless you have a valid CA state drivers license.  They lost my sale and I will never go there again even though we visit this outlet store every year and do our big ticket shopping here as everything is way more expensive in Singapore, especially Rolex watches.< /review><Name>Beverly Lukaszewski</Name>< resp>

My husband and I were just in on Friday (April 5th) and had a great experience. Alec, the store manager helped us select a beautiful rose gold and diamond necklace for my birthday present. Alec (and the rest of the staff) were very friendly and helpful and all the jewelry was reasonably priced. They even cleaned my rings at no extra cost. Thank you guys so much!<//text>

I went into the store looking for a pair of earrings for my boy friend and I ended up walking out with a beautiful chain for my brother as well. I was trying to replace a necklace that my brother lost many years ago in Rosarito beach and I found one that looked exactly the same. Nik and Alec were so pleasant, they heard my story and supported my decision, they were very funny and outgoing. I also work in costumer service and they treated me the way I treat my clients, with a smile and personable service!! They were also so patient and went the extra mile to help me out with the pricing of my purchase. I will definitely go back soon!< /review>

I walked in looking for a Gold Chain, Walked out with my chain and a Trip to Vegas! ALEC was super attentive to our needs and showed us extremely awesome customer service!  He showed me various different links and was extremely knowledgeable of his products. As active military we are very weary when shopping in jewelry stores but Alec insured we were taken care of and we sure were. Will shop again! Thank you Alec & Thank you Kevin Jewelers.< /Review>

I picked out a very nice 1 carat diamond for the love of my life with the help of Verna, Alec, and Karen. They were the most helpful, informative, and lovely people who will help you find that perfect diamond for your love of your life! I would definitely recommend going to them for anything you need for your loved ones.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Amazing experience here! Just bought my fiancé’s  wedding ring and it’s amazing. Price was half as much for the same ring at Kay. Plus the staff was ultra friendly. On top of it they have a better trade in option compared to anyone else. As in we can upgrade the ring and receive a credit towards a bigger one... fiancé loves this. But so do I. Can’t recommend them enough saved thousands.<//review>

I spent almost a hour in the store ordering a ring. While the lady was on the phone with the jeweler and they promised me the ring by the 20th. So I get a phone call from them on the 16th telling me they wanted more money for ring..  not very good business.<//text>

This definitely does not sound like the type of service we are aiming to provide. Please note this is certainly a unique and abnormal situation, otherwise we would not still be in business for over 45 years. Could you please send us an email at cs@kevinjewelers.com with more details about your experience so that we can look into this. We would appreciate another opportunity to turn this into a five-star experience for you. Thank you very much in advance!'}</Response>

We stopped in here after dinner next door. You can order Chinese food here after the restaurant closes. Owners were friendly as well as the regular locals. Drinks were good.

<text>Chambers Room is a very nice bar with a "Cheers" atmosphere. Friendly patrons. They serve beer, wine, and liquor. Sorry no drafts. Just cans & bottles. The bar has been open over 40 years, so it's not fancy, it's a dive bar. And it's right up the street from the Golden One Arena. Just two blocks. Drop in and check it out. Yelp has.<//text>< pictures>

It's a dive bar but the people are nice and the drinks are cheap. I suggest you use a men's and ladies room before you get there it smells atrocious.</review>

<text>The best Chinese in Corning or Red Bluff that I've had! Don't know about Orland? But I am from Chico (a native) & it almost beats a few there! The young husband & wife(Sue) are the cleanest, most accommodating & really make you feel like family! They haven't disappointed us in 1 year!!!!👍💜</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Great food, great service. Very clean premises. Unlike most Chinese food places. Bathrooms hospital clean. Its a 30 minute drive away from my town. But always worth it to make the drive there.< /text>

The food here is Awesome. The orange chicken has such a crisp citrus flavor that tantalizes every note on your tongue. Each piece  is large and moist maintaing a delicate crisp with an unbelievable  fresh orange taste.   I've never been disappointed  and I'm discriminating! Best Chinese food , Their  spring  rolls are very authentic  not the usual  mushy frozen version. A restaurant  you dont want to miss. Very clean and highly personable.</review>

Had sat down and had our menu items all decided for our family. When I tried calling was told they no longer serve any combination meals that you have to order each thing separately.   We ended up just getting drive through. I know lots of other people prefer getting combination plates verses huge amounts of one item.</Text>

Too much sugar or sweet sauce. The orange chicken tasted similar to glaze donuts and the broccoli was very soggy and drowned in sweet sauce.

I ordered 9 entrees, which were all supposed to come with white rice or fried rice. I asked for white rice and the lady only gave us one side of white rice, for 10 people. I asked for more rice and she brought a tiny bowl of white rice and charged me for it. Wow, horrible.< /text>

Great clean & very delicious food!!! For the whole family, Chinese people speak English and food is very tasty, they make it fresh for you, we're traveling from Oregon and it's was close to i5 freeway. Stuff was very nice and place is clean! Planning to stop by it there on the way back! I recommend :)<//text>

<Review>I miss the old owners but...  still love this place, may be a different style of Chinese food than you are used to but it is good food, mid range price, you get a lot and it doesn't make you sick or have to run to the bathroom. The salt and pepper shrimp is awesome!  Mongolian Chicken and pepper beef are also some favorites.<//Review>< user_name>

< Review>
A lot better than I expected.  It was liks 3 minutes from the Super 8 we were staying at.  The decor's not particularly nice (perfectly serviceable, of course), the restaurant was completely empty when we got there, and purchasing individual cans of soda was a bit odd.  We were a little wary about the price of the food at first, but the portion size and quality quickly assuaged that.  Everything we were served was fantastic; the orange chicken was possibly the best I've ever had.

I'd certainly recommend it.<//Review>

<Text>I appreciate the thoughtful care and understanding of what's needed to improve my health, provided by Dan Abels, L.Ac.  I came to him when traditional medicine wasn't resolving many of the Post-Covid/Long-Haul issues I was having around inflammation in my body that impacted my heart function, my energy level, my ability to sleep and some of the brain fog I was experiencing.  He listened, used techniques to improve my health and I am improving week over week.  Thanks Brannan Street Acupuncture for your help!< /Text><name>Marie Gimbrone< /name>< Time>

<text>Great experience! Dan Abels is extremely attentive and detail oriented. The care provided is extremely tailored to your specific needs and the organization of the business makes appointments very easy. I saw noticeable differences in my overall mood, sleeping patterns and migraines after just one session. Highly recommend.</text>< gmap_id>

**** 2021 Summer - still five stars.

I am very grateful for Dr Abels. My anxiety is (was) terrible. i have Social Anxiety that will turn into huge panic attacks. But as long as I am seeing Dr Abels it’s gone. and I mean gone gone. I just recently went about a month without a treatment and had some upheaval in my life. I was crying daily, afraid to get out of bed. I had realized i hadn’t had acupuncture in a while. Made an appointment and he noticed just from talking to me that I was a big ball of anxiety. I left my appointment as if i had been upgraded, rebooted, i can’t describe it really. but a 180 from the person I was earlier that day. On top of his knowledge, he’s so kind and genuine.</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Excellent, and quick 30 min acupuncture tune-up services. Dan clearly knows his craft, and each session is worthwhile. The only improvement I'd suggest is to re-format the frequency of outbound appt reminders and confirmation requests through the office's patient scheduling software. Without an active unsub, I typically get no fewer than 4 text and email notices prior to each visit.<//Text>< Pics>

I can't say enough good things about Dr. Abels. I originally went in for digestion issues and have become a regular over the last 2 years. Dr. Abels addresses each issue with great care and thought. His rooms are private, warm, and have soothing music. If you are looking for an acupuncturist, look no further.</text>

<Review>I have been suffering from a back issue in my L5S1 and other lower back issues for a few years now but over the last six months it’s turned far worse with a bulging disk. After countless MRIs pain pills and steroid shots while waiting for my DRs to navigate The best route I ended up finding Brannan Street acupuncture. It’s my first time I’ve ever done acupuncture so I was a little skeptical at first but let me tell you I am in the best hands possible. He took the time to ask the right questions pinpoint exactly where the start of my pain is coming from. The doctor is extremely knowledgeable and Thorough in the pre-examination. I’ve now gone back a couple of times while waiting for the Nuro department at UCSF to find a solution for my issue. With each visit we dig deeper and deeper into exactly where to place the needles that have absolutely been a life changer for me. I’m an active young athlete along with my career forces me to be mobile at all times. I can’t speak highly enough for this business even if you’re skeptical or nervous about trying acupuncture I highly recommend you dive right in it’s so worth it!<//Review>< Pictures>

Dan is very professional and I do like how his sessions are 50% acupuncture 50% massage. It’s an awesome combo and local for me. Specifically, he’s helped me with a persistent nagging neck injury in which I’ve not had any solutions to over the years.< /Review>

Didn't know what to expect going in since this was my 1st acupuncture experience. I have to say I am now a believer. Dan was super clinical in the initial review of my symptoms, and I left with my shoulder feeling exponentially better after both traditional PT and chiropractic treatments yielded limited results<//text>

<review>What a wonderful exoexperie!

My wife booked a session for me here through the website. Luckily my insurance covers accupuncture and Dr. Abel's took it. (Major provider) Location is easy with street parking available.

Dr. Abel's was very friendly and asked questions about what was bothering me. The session was very good, the room is very clean and comfortable. I feel much better and I will be coming back!</review></record>

My overall experience with Mr. Abels was awesome! He was professional, great communication before, during and after my treatment which was painless and left my injured back feeling less guarded and loose. I will be back again.< /Text>

Had a good first experience with acupuncture. Dan has been treating my broken arm. The massage helps with the shiftness of the muscles after the repair of a titanium rod and screws in my humerus.</text>

<Text>Sales lady Dennise didn't know anything. DO NOT GO to this location. We went in for a Mother's day special and she told us to come AFTER the special was over so we pay full price instead of half... either she tried to get one on us or she is brain dead and doesn't know anything.... either way DO NOT GO to this location. Many locations nearby within a 5 minute drive.<//Text>< pics>

<pics>None</pics><review>Store Manager Edgar told me a lot of lies. Said he was “throwing in” free accessories with our 3 new phones. Turns out he charged me in my bill for installments. He also didn’t give the promotion I came in for and am currently getting that fixed as well. Also told me the down payments were about half less than what he charged me. And also said I “had to have” insurance on at-least 2 phones for 3 months. Which I find out I do not. Single mom trying to do something cool for her kids for Christmas turned into a nightmare thanks to this guy. Trying to found out who his boss is so I can give them an earful. Worst customer experience ever. Go to a different location.<//review><rate>1< /rate><GmapID>0x80d94f3bee39196f:0xba7057e193759d10<//GmapID>< Time>

< Review>
I went recently because I have a receive a promotion of I switch to T-Mobile will have a mini iphone 12 free, so I was looking for this switch. There were two people working in the store and the girl who attended to me since the beginning had a bad vibe, later she start making excuses that promotion doesn't apply to me and I have show her the ad in the T-Mobile website, she called some manager and still continue excuses, what I saw basically she didn't want to do her job probably and was asking me send me to another store. At the end I didn't switch and they loose a potential customer who will stay loyal if they treat me well since the beginning.</Review>

The Sprint Store was great.  Yareli and Edgar provided us with great service.  They were very patient and help-full.  They did everything to set us the new I Phone 10.  Thank you for all your help<//Text>

It was awful, they gave me a bunch of free stuff for being a long time customer and found out that everything was on my bill. When I returned them they threatened me to bring out the camera and I said bring them out and I hope it has sound so you could hear everything your representative said to me.  Free is NOT free!< /text>

<text>My boyfriend and I always have a great experience when we come to this store. The employees are super approachable and helpful. Manny helped us out when my boyfriend got his new iPhone 7 and gave us great deals on accessories for his phone. There's plenty of Sprint stores we could go to but this one is our favorite. They always treat us well and the customer service is always great and friendly. I'd definitely recommend this place for the employees alone. Thanks Manny!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This Sprint store is definitely the best I've been to. Adrian and Manny were a great help. They helped me get rid of my old, broken down Note 4 and get a new Note 7. The store was quite busy, but they did well to assist multiple customers at once to ease wait times. Come here fellow San Diego residents!</Text>

It was a long experience but Manny made it worth the wait. Honestly, the best customer service, knew exactly what he was doing and got it done. I am glad my husband and I went to this particular store because it was such a great experience.</review>

This is literally the best sprint store that Ive been to. I usually have a distaste for going to phone stores cause of bad service or delayed wait times. But Manny made this a really fun experience. He's so professional and well informed, yet so lively and outgoing that makes the whole experience simply awesome. Im definitely coming back to this sprint store from now on, they're the best!!!< /Text>

<date>1475734109550< /date><rating>5<//rating><review>THIS LOCATION IS THE BEST!!  I broke my phone and purchased another to be activated.  I struck out at online self activation,  then also on the phone to Sprint, waiting over 20 minutes to be told I had to go to a Sprint Store.  The location at Broadway near Palomar is the worst...been there 3 times in the past and nearly canceled my service after seeing them the last time when I purchased my Note3.  Looked at the web for an alternate location, so scheduled an appointment for Terra Nova on E. H St.  There I met Adrian;  friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.   I could not believe it.  Not only did he activate my new phone, but was able to retrieve all my photos, contacts, texts, etc. from my shattered phone with a black screen.   How could I ask for more?!!  He needs to teach ALL the employees at the Broadway store how to treat a customer!!!!!  Adrian, you are amazing!!!!!'<//review>< pics>

<text>Best customer service from any store I have been to. All of the employees greeted my wife and I when we walked through the door and they made sure we felt welcome. The sales reps are not pushy they actually listened to what I needed and made sure that we left with what we needed, and we didn't have to wait for 2 hours to be helped.If you want a store with quick service and people that take care of their customers go to this store< /text>< pictures>

I walked in today really sad because my wife lost her phone at Sears! It was so unfortunate and totally clouded and beautiful, sunny San Diego day. But Manny helped remove the rainy clouds above us and got her a new iPhone 6s with exquisite customer service! He even hooked it up with a discount on accessories since we were having such an unfortunate day. Definitely the best sprint store I have been to!!!<//Text>

Ana and Manny were exceptional. They took time with my mom and dad, answered all of our questions (and we had a lot of them), never made us feel rushed or pressured.  Would DEFINITELY recommend the Terra Nova store. Great customer service is hard to come by. Could not be more pleased!!!< /Text>

Amazing service hands-down. I initially walked in to just ask a question about my device, and I had a great conversation, and even ended walking out with a shopping bag. Definitely making this my main store!</Text>

Wow this location is amazing. They were very friendly and knowledgable about all products. When I come in it is like my local friendly bar where everyone knows your name. I do not mind coming in to upgrade or service because I trust them.< /Review>

The gentleman at the store, Adrian, was very kind and provided excellent service. Aside from saving me on my Verizon bill, they provided some entertainment in the form of 'Rubber Duck' fishing that earned me a 20% discount on my case. Definitely coming back here and sending my family.<//text>

Excellent service. Everyone was very friendly and help. Especially, thanks to Manny, Carlos, and Adrian for going above and beyond with their customer service. This isn't the closest store to me but because of the service I'll travel the extra distance.</Text>

Horrible experience. I purchase service and two phones. The manager Luis was punching for me to take 5 lines but I don’t need them. He said that i would get a rebate of $700 if  i took them. I ended up taking one for a total of 3. They didn’t give me a copy of my service agreement at the time or a receipt for the purchase. I took the phone home but in the area  I leave in, the signal was not as strong as I need it. So I came back to ask for a copy of my contract and a copy of my receipt. They say “you should of gotten them emailed.”  I didn’t so that why I’m here and also to cancel service. Well that when the nightmare started. Rosalina the rep is very unprofessional and doesn’t know the meaning of customer service. They given me the round around to cancel service when they have a 14 day customer satisfaction. It’s sad it didn’t work. Tanks to poor or lack of training.</Review>

Describe your experience? Hmmm,
Well my experience here at the sprint store in terra nova was superb. Manny was patient and more than informative when helping me set up my phone plan. Was in and out with a brand new rose gold iPhone 6 in less than 30 minutes!!!
Thanks a bunch guys!</Review>

Adrian and the crew where amazing with me. The customer service was awesome and they were able to get what was just right for me! I end up getting 3 new iphones from them thanks to the customer service. I am willing to spend any amount for the best service, but here I am getting the best price out there and the best customer service. I went down to the Sprint in Eastlake and they werent helpful at all, I walked in and told them I need it a phone and treat me bad. Best sprint store in town!</text>

Not willing to help. I was told by one of the rep's to call myself to the others stores,  they where out of hotspot . They said their policy is  not to call the other stores to see if they  have any in stock.  Bad policy and bad service.<//text>

Bad customer service. Be back in 30 mins, then call back in 2 hours. If we cant fix it we'll order another phone. Gave them 6 hours still cant fix the phone. Went back thr next day to make sure thry have ordered it. They asked for a eticket. "I didnt get one"...why they asked..."i dont know, they're not my employees, ask the tech" oh hes not in they say. "So did you order me another phone?". Guess what, they havent even done that, so now i guess the customer has to follow through making sure they do their job.
Finally they ordered me another phone, gave me back the broken one back so i can bring it back when the new one arrives. "Where the screen protector i had on it"...IDK they said...geesh really?
Oh almost forgot. As i was sitting there i was overhearing one of the sales rep giving this older guy wrong information how all these phones have the same processor so there virtually the same, blah blah blah...and of course hes trying to sell him the most expensive phone they have.
If you're going to sell a device, at least know what the hell you're selling...dont mislead people just because you wanna make a buck. If you dont know, read the specs, should be part of your job!
Customers go there and rely on the info you give them. Maybe hes working his way up to be a car sales man. You all know how trust worthy they are, right?<//text>

Had the porterhouse, and it was really, REALLY good. We came here for a special occasion so I understood we had to fork out quite a bit of money.

The Eagle something Manhattan was really good, and REALLY strong. One drink was basically two, which made sense because it was the price of about three drinks.

Steak tartar for appetizer... again, very tasty.</text>

<Text>House of Prime Rib was packed so, me and a buddy of mine decided to walk a block down to Harris and give it a try.  We were NOT disappointed.  I will say this, this place is a definite collared shirt for the fellas.  The environment was dimly lit so we knew this was a more different scene than HOPR.  This was the big boys league now, and we came to play!< /Text>< pictures>

Great place to eat breakfast and lunch.  Delicious smoothies.  Good variety in the menu with outside patio on lovely Del Mar.

They use natural vegetables in smoothies and their meats don’t taste genetically modified.

Captain Mauri's has some really good food. The Bombay melt is to die for! Other dishes are pretty good but not exceptional. However, for the price, it's pretty great. Come here if you're looking for a cheap healthy option in San Clemente.<//text>

I love this place it's family owned and run food cooked by the mom and dad. Daughters are the servers and they make a variety of great food. I don't eat meat so I can't speak for these dishes but the veggie options are great. It's worth a stop in if your here visiting.<//Review>

My wife and I had lunch at Yosemite Falls Cafe. I had the small chicken apple salad and she had the steak salad. We had 2 sodas, total bill before tip was $36. Now the food was good, waitress friendly and facilities clean, that's a lot of money for lunch. There are a lot of places along Blackstone with good food for less.< /review>

Outside of the lunch hour (a little bit busy then) it's a good place to meet a business client. The macarons are the usual choice for me but everything I've had is good. Excellent service, too.< /review>

A lil pricey but omg it's worth it. Lemon meringue pie mini bites to die for...seriously. Omg. Try this place!< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>I been going here forever and if you like baked goods and great coffee and a great atmosphere this is the place to go. Highly recommended trying it here for breakfast or lunch try the soup and sandwiches or a crepe.< /Text>< pictures>

They are organized, friendly, and make sure your teeth are doing exactly what they’re supposed to do.  I imagined getting braces to be much more of a pain than it actually turned out to be. They are all extremely knowledgeable and excellent at the work they do. I’m so happy with my smile!< /text>< Pics>

I had an amazing experience with Dr. Fotovat and the team, they are all so kind, respectful, and helpful. I went from an expander to braces to Invisalign, and after all that my teeth are straight and I am happy with the results. My two brother also went to this orthodontist and were happy with their results. I 100% recommend coming to this place. Thank you so much.</Text>

Dr. Fotovat is the best in town, I’d highly recommend him to anyone.  He is very knowledgeable and friendly, takes his time explaining everything to you. Also his staff is so friendly! Something you don’t see often anymore. Most of all my experience was great and pain free and I love my new smile. Thank you!< /text>

Honestly an amazing orthodontist. I'm overdue in writing my review for them, but I can say their staff is great, office is great, take COVID super seriously (all the staff had space suits practically and were constantly sanitizing everything), prices good compared to other orthodontists, and Dr. Fotovat himself is extremely professional. Also they stay busy, and it's for a reason, it's because they're good.

I had orthognathic surgery for a class III bite and picked him based on the above factors, plus he had experience with other surgical cases, and he knew pretty much exactly what he was doing on my face. If you're nervous about doing surgery, seriously, it's worth doing and Dr. Fotovat is a good guy to pick for guiding your bite along the way. Check out their surgery case examples on their website ;)

Do note!!! However that they do use Essix retainers at the end of treatment, which are good in a lot of ways but need to be replaced every 2 years or so.

My teeth are practically perfect now ;D Pretty awesome! 10/10 recommend</review>

<review>I can't speak highly enough about Dr. Fotovat and his staff.  The doctor's gentle and professional demeanor made the process of starting Invisalign simple.  Every staff member is wonderful and each visit went smoothly.  My treatment was slowed down because of delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but Dr. Fotovat put me at ease and I just finished.  The results are amazing!  Throughout the pandemic, Dr. Fotovat went above and beyond with safety procedures.  The entire office operates at the cutting edge of up to date technology for orthodontic work.  This was a wonderful experience and I suggest Dr. Fotovat to anyone looking for Invisalign treatment.< /review>< pictures>

I got Invisalign and when I accidentally lost a liner, they made a retainer for me until the next set came in with no additional charge. I was super grateful for that. My friend also got Invisalign, but at a different office, and in order to get the mold of her teeth she had to go through this terrible gel mold thing. However, my experience was so much better. Here, they have a 3D scanner and there was hardly any discomfort. Super great place.< /Review>< resp>

I just finished my treatment today with better than expect results. My experience with Dr. Fotovat and his staff has been overwhelmingly positive, from consultation to end treatments. They take the time to thoroughly explain every step of the process, and will answer any questions or concerns you might have in these trying times. True professionals, and I can't recommend them enough.</review>

My teenage daughter just finished with her invisalign braces and we are thrilled with the results. Dr. Fotovat and his staff were professional, kind and supportive through the full process. Their offices are clean, comfortable and feel modern.

My daughter was the second member of our family to visit Dr. Fotovat. A few years ago I also got invisalign braces and have been happy with the result for 5+ years. Our family strongly recommends visiting Dr. Fotovat for your needs.< /Review>

We just removed my son's braces and are extremely happy with the results. Dr. Fotovat and everyone in his office were always very professional and pleasant. Everyone was always very responsive and accommodating to last minute appointment changes, emergency visits. We were very pleased with our overall experience in working with Dr. Fotovat. I will definitely recommend him to our friends and family.</review>

My wife pointed me here as she had an excellent experience with Dr. Fotovat. I never thought my teeth were terrible; just some minor annoyances like inconsistent gaps where food would get stuck and other cosmetic issues. After completing Invisalign everything is great and it really is a big improvement. He and his staff are top notch and I felt 100% comfortable with their cleanliness and such throughout the pandemic.</Text>

Dr. Fotovat and the entire staff were all amazing to work with.  If you are looking to get invisalign like I did I highly recommend Dr. Fotovat for this service.  He laid out clear expectations of what the process would be and was there to guide every step of the way.  The entire team was the most professional and if I had to go back again I would most definitely return. Most importantly, my smile is night and day better than when I walked in for treatment.  Happy Customer!<//text>

My daughter started her treatment about two years ago and the experience was pleasant given that we are talking about braces. They really took care of her and were able to adapt during this Covid pandemic. The office staff is very nice and the technicians and orthodontists very child-friendly. Very great work and she is happy with her new smile.< /text>

Just finished invisiline. Worked better than I hoped. Dr. Fotovat provided a safe experience through covid in 2020 and I actually finished up early! Great communication and very professional. They made the whole process very easy.< /Review>

I just had the most horrible experience with the staff at Dr. Fotovat's office and I do not recommend working them. He came recommended from both my daughters dentist and my own dentist, so I thought it would be a great fit. I called about a consultation and they had me send pictures online and then called me to discuss. I spoke with a coordinator named Kristen who was very nice on the first call and in answered my questions. Her follow up was to run my insurance and call me back. She called me the next day at 2pm as I was going into a meeting so i asked if I could call her back. She said no, but she would call me at 3pm. Well, she never called back. The day after I was extremely busy at work and forgot to follow up, and she still never called back. So Monday I call and finally speak to her about my insurance and for no reason at all she was extremely rude to me! She clearly had no patience to answer my questions, when I was told I would have to pay completely out of pocket. This is a huge investment, both money and time, and as a new patient it is understandable that I have questions. She was rude, off putting, bothered and tried to rush me off the call. I was in shock! I was extremely nice to her in trying to understand the process so I can make an informed decision. When we ended I said I would call back if I want to schedule my first appointment. So, even though I wasn't too happy about that call, yesterday I called and spoke to someone named Rosa about scheduling my appointment. And for some reason, she REFUSED to schedule me! She kept saying she had to consult with Kristen and it made NO SENSE. What's to discuss? My consultation is complete and I understand my payment. But she REFUSED. She told me Kristen would call me back at 1pm. And guess what - NO ONE CALLED ME BACK!! So this morning I call and Rosa answers, and she immediately passes me to the Office Manager Susie. Susie proceeds to tell me THEY DON'T WANT ME AS A PATIENT?! I was in shock!!! Their staff was rude, inconsiderate, impatient and twice didn't call me back when the said they would. I was nothing but nice to everyone, even when I had to chase them down for information, and they were rude to me! But apparently, they have no patience for a new potential client, who wants to give them her money, in just trying to understand the process. I literally asked if they are doing so well during a pandemic that they don't need new customers?? And the dentist should know how potential patients are being treated. Well, apparently he DOES! She said this was part of this decision too! So, if Dr. Fotovat APPROVES of his staff being rude, then imagine how he must treat patients himself. Clearly I dodged a bullet here because I can't imagine dealing with such a rude and impatient staff for almost 2 years if I did even move forward with them. And ironically I was starting to have doubts because of how rude they were already and having to chase them for information. To then get told they didn't want me as a patient was the most absurd thing ever! I have NEVER been treated that way in my life and was in absolute shock. So if you have any questions at all about getting braces and want to be treated with patience and kindness, do NOT go to this dentist. You will not get that here.< /Text>

<text>True professionals here! They make the entire process a breeze from the friendly and knowledgeable front office staff to the board certified doctor that is truly kind and compassionate. He came highly recommended to me from another dentist. My son started treatment first which made it an easy decision when it was time for my daughter to get braces. The front office was thorough and precise when it came to billing my dual insurances. The office is also nicely remodeled! And finally, the results are amazing!! My daughter had her braces removed today and she couldn’t be happier. He’s an expert in his field!</text>< user_name>

Dr. Fotovat and his team are absolutely wonderful! I had braces for 2 years, visiting every 2 months for tightening, and I never had a bad experience. The braces rarely hurt and the tightenings felt professional and unobtrusive. The appointments were always quick and available, and Dr. Fotovat and his team are friendly and talkative, they made me feel right at home. The facility is clean and comfortable, and they've been handling the COVID-19 pandemic well. The team wear masks, face shields, and change disposable gloves frequently. The stations are spread out, and patients' temperatures are checked before entering. And to top it all off, my teeth look great, too! The big reveal was worth every penny!<//text>

Thank you so much Dr. Fotovat and staff, I love my smile! I’m so grateful to have found this place. The two years of wearing braces went so fast. I would highly recommend Dr. Fotovat, he always explained every step. Great experience overall and felt safe especially during a pandemic.</Review>

Dr. Fotovat and his entire team were awesome throughout my Invisalign treatment. They were all great about explaining the process to me before I even signed on and answered every question I had. Once the treatment began they were always very attentive and helpful with any questions that came along. Dr. Fotovat uses top technology which makes the entire treatment easy and painless. His staff in the front office was also great with any rescheduling needs and they are very friendly.</text>

From my first Invisalign consult to the final day, Dr Fotovat and his staff have been amazing. The dedication, attention to detail and patient service is impressive - they take their time and when they’re working with you, they’re always present. The COVID prevention protocols are state of the art - HEPA filters, UVC air purification systems, and they have this suit they wear during examinations that look like a space suit with its own air supply. There’s also never too many people in the office - they schedule everyone carefully. I’m so happy with my new smile, can’t believe how it looks. If you’re considering getting braces or Invisaligns, I highly recommend Dr Fotovat!!!</Review>

Dr Mehdi’s office is a kind & courteous place. I went to him for Invisalign on recommendation of my dentist at Toluca Lake Dentistry. My teeth were really crooked but now they are perfectly straight after using Invisalign. Dr Mehdi has the most current and cutting edge dental and orthodontic equipment. I would definitely recommend him to any of my friends or family. Thank you Dr Mehdi!< /Text>

Dr. Fotovat and his team are amazing. From our first visit until today, the day the braces came off, the experience has been great. There has never been an insane wait at our appointments and scheduling (sometimes needing to reschedule due to school) has always been a breeze and accommodated. During the COVID crisis his office has remained vigilant with safety precautions and always communicative. Dr. Fotovat is always available to answer questions and really connects with his patients and their orthodontic needs. My son Connor's smile is beautiful!< /Review>

<text>I took my daughter to Dr. Fotovat little over 2 years ago and it was a great experience.  The office was always very clean, the staff were always friendly, professional & accommodating. Our family highly recommends Dr. Fotovat as an orthodontist, especially during COVID-19. They have gone above and beyond following the health and safety protocols during this crazy time.< /text>< Pics>

Dr. Fotovat and his staff are some the most nicest people I've met. I highly recommend this this place to anyone weary about the braces process. These people are professionals at what they do. I can smile big and proud because of Dr. Fotovat and his staff.< /review>

<Text>Just finished my Invisalign treatment with Dr. Fotovat today and I have nothing but good things to say about him and the whole team! I really liked how upfront Dr. Fotovat was by informing me with how my teeth are structured and what the possible outcomes were with the treatment. Overall, 5 stars all around with my results and I think I’m actually gonna miss going there!!!! 😥 Lol<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I am beyond thrilled and excited with my new smile. Dr. Fotovat and his team are top notch. From the front desk when you walk in, to sitting in the examination chair, everyone is so nice and welcoming. You are treated professionally and with respect. Of course, the most important thing is the quality of the work. Dr. Fotovat is committed to making your teeth the best that they can be. I completed my treatment with Invisalign and I am impressed with the results. I used to hate smiling but now I find myself grinning all the time🙂 Of particular note, is how the business has adopted safety protocols to keep everyone safe during Covid-19. Everyone has proper PPE and all patients are screened and have their temperature checked before they enter. I feel very safe inside.

I proudly recommend Dr. Fotovat.< /Review>

I brought my tween in on the recommendation of our family dentist and was immediately impressed with how efficient and fun the office was. My kid was all too excited to get her smile adjuster, but her journey was easy with little effort needed on my part. They offered interest free payments for the amount insurance didn't cover and have wonder staff dedicated to each area so you never feel alone in the process. As soon as the pandemic subsides, I'll be making an appointment to have my smile fine tuned.</review></record></dataset><record>

Both my son and daughter have braces which were put on by Dr. Fotovat's team.  My son recently had his removed and we are thrilled with the results. His teeth look amazing and as a result his confidence is now through the roof. The whole process was much easier than anticipated b/c Dr. Fotovat and his team are extremely professional, courteous and patient.  He has a state-of-the-art office with all of the latest equipment and they are always up-to-date with the latest in dental technology.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good orthodontist!!</Text>

<review>Dr Fotovat was a wonderful experience.  Two years ago I met with Kristen she went over the braces contract options.  Kristen is a kind, caring efficient employee that answered all my questions and allowed me to make a decision at my leisure.  Once I had my son going to his appointments the visits were flexible to my lifestyle needs, the office staff at every visit was communicative and friendly.  My overall orthodontist experience was easy, safe and caring.  Thank you Dr. Fotovat<//review><resp>{'time': 1602799383788, 'text': 'It was our pleasure! We hope your son enjoys his great new smile!

<Text>Dr. Fotovat did a better job on my smile than I could have ever imagined. Started off needing braces and having an excessive overbite resulting in some discomfort. Thanks to Dr. Fotovat who guided me and got me through double jaw surgery.

<text>I was referred to Dr. Fotovat via my dentist of of 6 years DDS Janet Weaver. The entire process from beginning to end was very smooth and pleasant. This was a two year process. I was met with the utmost professionalism, kindness and respect the entire two years from Dr. Fotovat as well as his staff.

<Text>I went to Dr. Fotovat for Invisalign back in April 2019 and just finished 21 months of treatment under his care. His office was always immaculately clean, the staff were always friendly, professional & accommodating. I’m so glad I chose Dr. Fotovat as my orthodontist, especially during COVID-19.

Been with Dr. Fotovat and his staff with many years and my family has been gone to them as well. Always very thorough and pleasant while staying with following the CDC Guidelines to make sure that you feel comfortable in spite of Covid. I just got my braces off and the process that they used very quick and painless as well as efficient despite needing to leave time for disinfecting all of the equipment. They make sure that you feel welcome and happy with the work done and we've never had a bad experience there. Keep up the good work Dr. Fotovat and staff!< /Review>

This is office is organized, friendly and they do great work.  My daughter was able to get appointments that worked with our hectic schedule.  My daughter got her braces put on Dec 2018 and we were told it would be 18 months with them on.  she actually was finished sooner than that.  Her teeth look amazing.  We are beyond happy with this office and Dr. Fotovat and his staff. Soon we will be bringing my son for his braces.  Can't thank them enough.<//review>

We have been very pleased with Dr. Fotovat and everyone in his office. We have been going there for years and having 3 kids, so we will be there for years to come. The office is so kid friendly and in this age of covid they have taken all the best precautions. We feel very taken care of there.< /review>

Dr. Fotovat has been treating both my daughters for the last 5 years. Last week my oldest had her braces removed and we could be happier with the results. My daughter’s jaw were too small and causing limited space for new teeth to come in and a possibly to have to remove a permanent tooth just for space. Dr. Fotovat did everything he could to ensure that wouldn’t happen. He was able to widen her jaws, correcting both an overbite and underbite. My daughter was not the most compliant patient and we almost had to stop treatment because of her constantly breaking brackets. Dr. Fotovat calmly and patiently explained to her that it was on her to make sure the brackets don’t break so we could complete treatment. After her had this conversation we finished 5 months later with no broken brackets. The whole staff is amazing and I am glad he was recommended to us by their dentist. He truly cares about the appropriate treatment and timing of the treatment of his patients. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I've been visiting Dr. Fotovat ever since I got my first pair of spacers at the age of six. Today, I got my braces taken off, after about nine years of visiting Dr. Fotovat. I cannot deny just how easy this journey has been. Dr. Fotovat and his staff have always been very friendly and straightforward, which really helped me understand the procedures and their purpose. The staff is very friendly and calm, and the location in general provides a very relaxing atmosphere. Would highly recommend paying a visit. When it comes to my experience in visiting dentists and orthodontists, Dr. Fotovat has always been a top choice, and looking back, I see why.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Dr. Fotovat and his staff have been kind, professional, flexible and on top of needed treatments even during the COVID-19 crisis. This is our second family member treated by Dr. Fotovat, that should say something. The office visits and entire experience has been everything we could’ve asked for.

<Text>This entire office makes me smile. Seriously. It's hard to find a doc you like who also has office staff that are fun and who don't make you wait forever for attention. Don't let their Halloween costumes, prizes and kind words distract you from the great treatment. Dr. Fotovat worked miracles with my twin's teeth; he's a thoughtful, considerate artist who thinks ahead to how a face will appear and how a bite will work. Bravo!!< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Dr. Fotovat and his team are wonderful! They're so patient, efficient, on-time, and very detailed in their explanations. He came highly recommended from a friend whose kids were seen by Dr. Fotovat and I'm glad we went with him and his team!< /Review></record></dataset><record>
<text>My case is a little unique, I had a pretty severe underbite and needed jaw surgery + orthodontics to fix my bite. its a very complex procedure and everything needs to be planned out far in advance.

i went to 4 other orthodontists before finding Dr. Fotovat and his team. He had previous experience in dealing with cases such as mine and seemed confident in his ability to address my issues.

As an adult having braces was NOT easy but Dr. Fotovat's team made it as tolerable as possible. I always felt very comfortable and they addressed all my issues immediately.

Scheduling appointments was a breeze and i rarely had any issues. they are also good about emergency appointments in case something goes wrong.

His team is great and experienced, they know what they are doing. I would occasionally get some of the newer team members, but the more experienced ones would help out and guide them. Overall, I can't think of even one time I had any big issue over the 2.5 years I was in braces.

Dr. Fotovat himself is great, very kind person and you can tell he genuinely cares about his patients and wants to ensure the perfect bite for everyone.

My case was only supposed to last 2 years but Dr. Fotovat recommended extending it to 2.5 years to make sure he got everything fitting perfectly. Visually I didn't see any difference but I can feel my bite is so much better now than it was just a few months ago.

Before any changes, he would personally check and see how things are moving along before giving instructions to his team members on how to proceed.

As for finances, the price was great, even lower than most others in the surrounding area. and the price is fixed right from the start for the total procedure including retainers. So if you're treatment plan gets extended, you don't have to pay extra. I paid a very affordable monthly fee.

As for COVID-19 concerns, don't worry at all. they are taking this VERY seriously and they have set up so many safe protocols I felt very safe going in for appointments.

If you are an adult and contemplating getting braces, I highly recommend Dr. Fotovat. It is important to have a doctor who takes your concerns seriously.

As for parents/kids - I can't speak directly but I always observed a very friendly and patient staff with the kids, they have on disney movies all the time and most kids seemed happy.

Good luck with your journey!< /text>< Rating>

Dr. Fotovat and staff are very nice and professional. The office is very clean and with all necessary adaptations for the safety of the patients. Treatment is done with the best technology. My daughter's treatment finished much sooner than expected thanks to the great knowledge of Dr. Fotovat. I really recommend anyone that needs ortho treatment to get a consultation with Dr. Fotovat before starting treatment anywhere else. Dr.'s Fotovat is the best orthodontist. :)<//Text>

Just got my invisalign off and my teeth have never looked better! The staff was so nice and they always greeted me with a big smile at the door. Everytime I came in to the office they always asked me how I was. They always kept me informed with what how my treatment was going to work or what to do incase anything happened to my invisalign. Thank you to all the wonderful staff and the amazing Dr. Fotovat!</Text>

Dr Fotovat is kind, smart, and top notch. You won’t find a better staff / better equipment. Do your research and meet a couple orthos before dropping $ on Invisalign, but you‘ll have your mind made up leaving here. Trust the process.</Text>

My daughter needed braces at 8 for a bite issue. She just finished her second round of braces 7 years later and the care, expertise, professionalism and love we were shown all these years was tremendous! We love Dr. Fotovat and all the wonderful staff at the office! Highly recommend!!!<//Text>

<review>Dr. Fotovat is the best orthodontics dentist I ever met. I was wearing braces in a foreign country, and the result was not as good as I expect. After years, things got worse, so I found Dr. Fotovat. He did a very detailed scan and careful calculation on my case then came out with an integrated solution. During my treatment, I was traveling back and forth, missed several appointments. He adjusted the treatment plan for me very patiently and carefully. My treatment ended up in a successful result and did not need to extend the procedure longer than I thought. I am satisfied with all the office visits, even in the Covid-19 time. Thank Dr. Fotovat and all of his office staff.< /review><user_name>shelly zhao<//user_name>< Response>

Dr. Fotovat and his staff are thorough, friendly, and pleasant to work with. My two daughters had braces and I recently completed Invisaligns with them. During this pandemic, Dr. Fotovat is concerned with the safety and well being of all his patients and his staff. I very much appreciate the precautionary measures that he has taken.

We are extremely satisfied with how our teeth were straightened, their philosophies and procedures for orthodontics, and the entire experience.

Thank you, Dr. Fotovat!</review>

I had a great experience that exceeded my expectations.  Dr. Fotovat and his staff were very clear about explaining my options, and carrying out the treatment exactly as planned.  They also made me feel very safe as they adapted to the extreme challenges faced because of COVID-19.  I recommend Dr. Fotovat to my daughter because of how much I trust him and his staff.<//review>

My daughter Sterni just got her braces off after 1.5yrs with Dr. Fotovat.  The office was clean, wait times very short, and communication good.  Compared to other orthodontists our family has used, visits were required less frequently, so less hassle.  The office is handling Covid well and techs are even wearing PAPRs.  It's nice to see them protecting their staff.<//text>

I had an incredible experience with Dr. Fotovat and his entire team (Kristin is a rockstar, as are the rest of the team members!)... Going in to explore getting braces as a 'forty-something' adult wasn't my idea of great time, but they made the entire process pleasant and I couldn't be happier with the results.  After my Invisalign experience, I finally have teeth that make me proud to smile and that I now know won't break or cause more dental issues due to grinding and the fact that they weren't aligned when I bit down.  They helped me avoid even more dental procedures (and cost) down the line... Super clean office - I also experienced a few visits during the COVID-19 challenge and they were super cautious and prepared - and service to put anyone at ease.  Thanks, Dr. Fotovat!< /text>

<Review>If you want to have a beautiful smile then don't wait, get your appointment now. I swear you won't regret it. I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Fotovat and his amazing and incredibly professional team. I finished my Invisalign treatment today after 1 year and 3 months. Everything went smoothly, never had a problem with making appointments, excellent service, and friendly staff. The important thing is that if you show some effort, they really help you to finish your treatment faster. THANK YOU Dr. Fotovat and thank you to your amazing team for helping me to have the smile of my dreams.<//Review>< Time>

Today I rang the gong!! I wasn't expecting it, but it was a small celebration as I am done with my Invisalign sets. I am so happy with my new smile!! When I first walked in, I was nervous, but after talking to Kristin, she help me ease my way into feeling comfortable and understanding the whole process. The staff is very welcoming and are happy to answer any questions that come along the way.  The process did not take long and my crowded teeth shifted quickly. Being able to fully follow the clear instructions given helped create my new smile :) Thank you Dr. Fotovat and your team!!<//review>

First off, I could never imagine my crooked teeth would ever look this good, but somehow Dr. Fotovat worked a miracle and my confidence is through the roof.  The office is a very nice, clean clinic with even nicer staff who always take great care of me and take the time to walk me through any questions I have.  Just superb care and service all around.  Even better, this place is a lot of fun to go to.  It seems every time I come in they're celebrating a holiday in all out style, even unofficial holidays like Star Wars Day on May 4th.  They always have the newest movies playing on TVs along the wall and some kind of sweepstakes, raffle or photo-op you can participate in if you like.  I even won one of the raffles once!
Everyone is very friendly and never feel like they want to rush you out the door.  I can't thank you all enough for the hospitality and care you all showed me, you really made this midwestern boy feel at home!  Proud to be a part of this family, and I'll take the smile they gave me everywhere for the rest of my life.<//text>

I was referred to Dr. Fotovat and all I have to say is, it was the best decision I ever made. I was skeptical about getting braces, because I only had minor gaps between my teeth. I always felt that it wouldn't have been a priority for myself or an orthodontist to fix those issues. Luckily, the welcoming staff and Dr. Fotovat made it a lot easier and made me feel more comfortable. Any questions I had they were more than happy to answer. I strongly recommend!< /text>

My whole life I've been insecure about my smile. Going to this place changed that ! I'm very happy and excited with the results. Thank you so much to all the assistants, employees and especially the doctor because without them this wouldn't be possible! All of them were very kind and helpful. Definitely recommend this place!<//Text>

My son just got his braces off and we are very happy with the results. Dr. Fotovat and his staff are very professional and friendly. Appointments are well-timed, so you get in and out pretty quickly.  Dr. Fotovat has been monitoring my daughter's teeth, reminding us when we need to make appts, and she will soon be getting her braces with Dr. Fotovat.  I definitely will recommend Dr. Fotovat to friends and family!< /review>

My daughters journey with Dr Fotovat and his office started about 2 years ago. Ever since then his office has been very kind and extremely helpful. My daughter finally got her braces off today and we could not be any happier with the results. We want to thank Dr Fotovat for transforming my daughters teeth and making them look beautiful. The staff is extremely kind and friendly. The whole office makes you feel welcomed. I will definitely recommend going to this office for your orthodontist needs. Dr Fotovat is an amazing orthodontist!<//review>

My first experience with the office was 2 years ago when my daughter needed braces. The last 2 years have been wonderful. The staff were always pleasant and professional. Dr Fotovat took great care of my daughter's needs. He has been a vital part of her treatment. When my daughter broke her wire, the office squeezed her in right away. Thank you so much  Dr Fotovat and staff for taking care of my daughter.</text>

I cannot express how great they are! Great customer service, super clean, no wait time, easy process, you name it, everything is amazing! Not once did I have any pain, any discomfort, nothing! They treat you great, beyond exceptional, always have a family movie for entertainment and music, and have some type of give away going on: Disneyland tickets, gift baskets, and other great prices. I drive over an hour to see Dr. Fotovat; his practice is worth the drive, the traffic, and the time. Trust me, BEST dentistry you will ever experience.</text>

I held off on braces for over two decades because I was terrified of getting teeth pulled. They don't pull them here of course and that would be a different review. I was referred here from my dentist next door to them. You never know with referrals but this place truly has earned my appreciation. All the staff are wonderful. Dr. Fotovat himself is a very outstanding orthodontist but also such a nice and patient person. I was anticipating 2+ years with these train tracks but I only had to wear them 1.5 yrs. teeth look great, I'm incredibly happy. It felt great to hit the it's over gong!< /review>

Overall, I had a great experience at this orthodontics! All the staff members were so friendly and the environment was comfortable. I remember coming in to get my braces put on for the first time feeling nervous and scared. However, Dr. Fotovat and Jojo made me feel safe throughout the whole treatment. I ended up with a smile I love :)</text>

<text>I always dreamed of having a beautiful smile, after being told I would have to have reconstructive surgery to achieve the goal- Dr. Fotovat proved that theory to be wrong, and now at 23 years old- I have my dream smile!!
The staff here is incredible; they are professionals with giant hearts and are truly the best at what they do.

I really enjoyed getting my teeth invisaligned by Doctor Fotovat. He is very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly! When looking at my before and after photos, I can definitely see what a difference he made on my teeth. They look so pretty and I can confidently smile in any photo op. As a patient, I liked the high quality Invisalign product he used. I would definitely recommend any possible patient to check him out for possible orthodontic work. My whole family got our teeth straightened by him!</Text>

You can't tell, but I can't stop smiling. I got my Invisalign off today, and my teeth are beyond what I thought they ever could be. Everyone in this office is extremely professional, nice, caring, and personable. I HIGHLY recommend coming here. I will be forever thankful.</text>

My dentist recommended Dr. Fotovat. I still consulted with a couple of other Orthodontists but it was clear he was the top choice. He took the time to answer all questions with regard to his best recommendation. However, he was open and willing to work with me (without pressure or issue) when I chose a little bit of a different route. Really great experience with the process and staff overall and I am happy I chose to go to Dr Fotovat.</Text>

Dr Mehdi Fotovat has given both of our daughters the lifetime gift of beautiful smiles!  Four families have chosen Dr Fotovat on their results and you should too!  The experience was efficient, stress-free and the staff was very friendly. The girls are thrilled and so are we! 😁

Thank you Dr Fotovat!< /text>

<Text>What an incredible experience! Had to have jaw surgery and Dr Fotovat walked me through every step of the process, from the allowing me to have invisalign instead of braces, to making sure my teeth were as perfect as can be after going through such a massive undertaking. Amazingly warm staff and a real comfortable environment.

Dr. Fotovat saved my teeth!  I had braces as a child but after getting them taken off, I foolishly never wore my retainers.  Fast forward to me as an adult, my teeth had shifted A LOT, I had even started developed buck teeth!  :(   I HATED my smile in pictures and I was afraid I would need full braces again-as an adult.  That was NOT an option for me because I am on camera all the time.  I came to Dr. Fotovat's office and thank goodness, he said I could do Invisalign instead of regular braces.  I just got them off today and my teeth look AMAZING!!!!!!

The office staff is always super nice and friendly (but never annoying or "too" friendly).  The office is always really, really clean and they seem very organized.  They also have state of the art technology where they show you how your teeth will move in your mouth during treatment and what they should look like after you've finished.  The prices were affordable and DEFINITELY worth the money.  Dr. Fotovat always has a smile on his face and whenever he saw me, he seemed like he had all the time in the world for me, he never made me feel rushed.  I really feel like he actually cared about my smile and that he takes GREAT pride in his work.  I loved the way he explained things to me whenever I had questions.  I'm SO GLAD I chose Dr. Fotovat as my orthodontist.  Thank you for literally saving my smile!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /Text>

Dr. Fotovat and his staff are nothing less than amazing!!! They were so nice and the entire journey of having braces went by like a breeze. I broke one bracket once and I called in to ask them to fix it, they fit me in the next business day and it was good as new. Would definitely recommend to anyone who needs braces!!!< /review>

I can't even begin to tell you how pleased I have been with Dr. Fotovat! Before coming to Dr. Fotovat I had considered direct smile club or other at-home teeth aligners. I am so incredibly thankful that I decided to go with Dr. Fotovat! Not only is he incredibly professional and has a warm presence, but he was very detail-oriented with my teeth. A couple of times I had a few teeth that just were not moving, but he provided the solution that I needed and at one point rescanned my teeth to make sure I had an aligner that would get the results I want. I will also say that his whole staff is incredibly welcoming and I truly felt like I was being taken care of. If you are thinking about getting Invisalign to do it and go to Dr. Fotovat!!< /review>

This has been our Orthodontic office since 1990 and would not change it for any other.  Dr. Fotovat is outstanding at his work and his staff, Just amazing!  I had my braces here in 1990, my husband and all of our three children.  We just love this wonderful place.  You want great care and results, Join Dr. Fotovat's Orthodontic office.  You won't regret it.  😁👌👏<//Review>

Very much a 5 star experience.  Dr. Fotovat is extremely kind and gentle.  He puts the patients and family at ease throughout the process.  There is always excellent communication about the plan and expectations. His staff is outstanding.  They clearly enjoy working together and are a true pleasure.  I have two children going through the braces process starting with palate expanders at an early age.  Nothing is rushed.  Payment options are generous and easy to manage.  I have and will continue to recommend Dr. Fotovat and his team.</review>

Today my son went to Dr. Fotovat for the last time. Dr. Fotovat removed his braces and my son was good to go. I was drowned in mixed emotions. I was happy that my son had PERFECT teeth (thanks to Dr. Fotovat) and I was sad that I will not be seeing this amazing doctor, this wonderful individual and his flawless staff. Visiting Dr. Fotovat During the past three year has been so joyous that not seeing a dentist is actually sad and upsetting. We loved Dr. Fotovat professionalism, his calm demeanor and his gentle and caring attitude.</Text>

<Review>My son just got his braces off and we couldn't be happier with the results!. My sons case was very complicated due to a broken nose midway through his treatment and a few other things but Dr Fotovhat and his staff were so professional, accommodating and friendly, they made having braces a great experience even for a 15 year old. I highly recommend them!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

My teeth were very crooked to the point that  it was painful to eat. I was referred to Dr Fotovat because my teeth had a unique issue where my tooth was laying down and it seemed nearly impossible to fix. Thanks to Dr Fotovat not only did he pick that tooth up but brought a better smile on my face.< /text>

My experience with Dr. Fotovat and staff was exceptional from day one to my last day of treatment. All (not just a couple) of the staff are professional, kind, and experienced. You will know exactly what you're paying for and how much it will cost and why. Dr. Fotovat and assistants practice continuous communication about procedures and what to expect. Dr. Fotovat shows you how you are progressing or not progressing with your invisaligns. It's important to use the tools provided to you for the best and quickest invisalign results. I highly recommend Dr. Fotovat and his team!!< /Text>

They give you many packs of rubber bands, encourage you and braces are not painful here as long as you brush your teeth after every food and try to floss at night. Dr. Fotovat offered me to get my front tooth and bottom row smoothed out because they were chipped after I got my braces taken off. When I went to another dentist and asked him about my teeth being slightly chipped he said it was fine. Dr.Fotovat pays close attention to his patients.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I had a wonderful experience coming to Dr. Forovat's office to get my Invisalign. In my younger years, I had braces and throughout the years my teeth started to shift into different positions. Dr. Fotovat transformed my teeth back into a beautiful alignment and even filed the top and bottom edges for a smoother look. The office was always clean and the staff friendly. Very thankful for my experience 😁</Review>

I had two separate phases done over the course of two years and a half and was extremely satisfied with the results I got. The staff is very warm and welcoming and the environment is friendly and always upbeat. Now that I am done I somewhat miss having braces because I want to come back. Overall my experience here was fantastic and I would highly recommend these services.< /Text>

Very professional, very caring, and very good at what they do. I would recommend them to anyone in need of orthodontist work. Thanks again!!!

I have absolutely come to love this place. The ladies at the check-in desk are always lovely and extremely welcoming. Dr. Fotovat is always honest and straight to the point about how the process is going. The attendants that assist when I go in for checkups are very gentle. I just got my braces off today and am so pleased with the turnout. I would recommend them to anyone in need of braces. :)< /Text>

<review>Amazing staff !! I never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seen by them.Their decor is beautiful and they're always playing new films while they work on your teeth.I wore my braces for 2 years but somehow it seemed like less.What I loved most about them is how they sat with me and gave me options and even recommended other dentists and surgeons.Now I'm brace-free and loving my smile.<//review>< pictures>

My experience here was awesome! Dr. Fotovat was great and so was everyone else. Everyone is friendly, greet you every time you walked in and they worked around your schedule. They make you laugh and not to be afraid during your appointment. They are very careful and thorough with their work, explaining to you what is going on and what will happen when you meet them again. I highly recommend them if you're looking for a place to get some braces or retainers.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Dr. Fotovat is such a great Orthodontist he knew exactly what I needed even after I decided at the last moment that I didn't want to have my oral surgery to fix my bite. He knew exactly what I needed to get my bite how I wanted it. Plus all his staff are awesome and super nice. My sister just finished her treatment last year and I just finished mine today after almost two years and my other sister has decided to come here also to have her braces on because she loved our results. Thank you all for my GREAT smile!!! :)< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>It was an amazing & satisfying journey for us especially to our son Psalm Joshua. From Dr. Fotovat to Ms Susie and his entire team kudos to them. They are so accomodating & very good in their field. My son's journey to them towards having a good & perfect teeth are awesome. Trusting their team was a very good decision we've done. Again from our entire family thank you for giving our son more confidence. Again thank you so much, we highly recommend this team.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I just finished treatment with my braces and it was totally worth it, I love my smile now :D! Everyone is very helpful and friendly and are thorough in explaining how to care and maintain for your dental hygiene. After you get your braces on and off they call to check up on you. I never had any complications during my treatment either. I feel very welcome there and would definitely recommend going and seeing Dr. Fotovat & Team.< /Review>

I highly recommend this Orthodontics office! I have had nothing but an amazing experience, all of the employees are nothing but helpful and kind; they truly work around your schedule, and needs to guarantee that you receive the best aid possible. Along with that Dr. Mehdi is incredible! He truly cares for the work that he is doing, and is fantastic when it comes to staying true to what he initially said. As long as you listen and do everything that he tells you to do the braces process will be a piece a cake! I would go here again and again! I could not be more satisfied with how my teeth came out, and I finished within 2 years, just as promised!</Text>

My son got his braces off today after a 2 year treatment. Wow! His teeth look fantastic! He had a misaligned bite along with a couple of other issues. Dr. Fotovat and his staff are awesome! Always take the time to fully explain everything and follow up. Great atmosphere, completely non stress. Now it's my daughters turn.<//Text>

<review>I hardly ever post reviews online but had to for Dr. Fotovat and his team.  After visiting his office for almost two years, I can confidently say that it was the best customer service experience I’ve ever had – and that is coming from someone who has never, ever had a good dental/orthodontic experience in the past.  This group is the definition of professionalism and they put care into every aspect of what they do.  Can’t believe I lucked out by strolling in based on their location/yelp reviews.  Somehow, my teeth came out better than expected.  I would strongly refer anyone considering Invisalign to go to Dr. Fotovot even if it requires a lengthy commute.  Don’t mess around when it comes to your teeth!</review>< Pictures>

Dr Fotovat's office has an amazing attention to detail. From the moment you walk into the office and get greeted by the nice ladies at the front desk to the dental assistants that made my daughter feel very comfortable and at ease at every visit. As for Dr Fotovat he is great. He really takes his time and explains his plans for treatment and the importance of dental care. My daughter got her braces removed yesterday after having them for over a year and the results were perfect!! She was so happy. I would highly recommend Dr Fotovat's office.< /Text>

<user_id>109894917170273797334< /user_id><Text>I have known Dr. Fotovat for over 18 years.  I am a General Dentist and have worked with many orthodontists in my 20 years of practice.  My Dental office is in Montrose, CA.  Although Dr Fotovat is 30 minutes away from my location, I still chose to take my kids to Dr. Fotovat for Orthodontic treatment.  Both of my kids now have a perfect smile.  For years, the reason we have been referring patients to Dr Fotovat is because every single patients comes back happy with the results.  The quality of treatment and materials used during the orthodontic treatment are second to none.  Once the orthodontic treatment is completed, all the brackets are removed cleanly without any scratches left behind.  I could not be happier with my referrals.
P.S.
The Office Staff is just wonderful.  I wish I could clone them for my office.

<Date>1598318168088<//Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>Update: My younger son just got his braces off today and we are thrilled. His teeth look amazing. I don't have anymore kids to send to Dr. Fotovat, but I might just go in for a consultation myself :)
Additionally, Dr. Fotovat's office has gone above and beyond to make sure patients and staff are safe and protected during this unusual time of Covid-19. Kudos!

First review: My son just got his braces off today and his teeth look incredible!  As an aspiring actor, he's ready to star in a toothpaste commercial!  Dr. Fotovat and his staff have been amazing to work with these past few years.  They are all knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  The office is beautiful.  The waiting area is comfortable and the parking is easy!  My younger son gets his braces on next month, and I'm thrilled for his smile to be in Dr. Fotovat's care for the next couple of years.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Thank you to Dr. Fotovat and his marvelous team. I rarely write reviews but I had to share my wonderful experience. From the first visit, I was provided a complete and thorough explanation of the process - no tricks, no surprises. The staff was polite and all smiles. Dr.Fotovat was professional, personable and a genius at his craft. Throughout the year that I was treated, not once did I have a reservation or concern- I knew I was in good hands. Because of Dr. Fotovat I have a perfect smile! A trustworthy office that I would recommend to friends and family.<//Review>< Rating>

I just finished my braces with Dr. Fotovat's office. They always kept me informed on my progress, what they were doing and why. The employees always had a great attitude and smiles on their faces. I would definitely recommend them to a friend.<//text>

Dr. Fotovat and his staff are the best! If you need an orthodontist, look no further. Every step of the process is explained clearly and completely. The office environment is welcoming, organized and fun. Most importantly, Dr. Fotovat is a great orthodontist :) If you are considering Dr. Fotovat or just looking for an orthodontist, I encourage you to go for the consultation. It will be an easy decision!< /review>

<Review>Dr. Fotovat and his staff made me feel very comfortable and welcomed. He's very down to earth and has a nice warm energy to him. I can tell that he cares about his patients and takes pride in his work. I ended up moving towards the end of my treatment and still had 2 visits left and they were so accommodating to my situation. They created an opening for me to get my braces off and rushed my retainers since i was flying out the same day. I am very grateful to have work done by Dr. Fotovat and have met such wonderful people! Thank you!</Review><GmapID>0x80c2960ba5a77217:0x94fbddc3acf6a793</GmapID>< Pictures>

My experience here at Mehdi Fotovat was perfect because you come in and everyone greets you, and takes away the fear or  nerves of going to the dentist. They are quick, and do not keep you waiting. Before they start to do anything they explain the process first. They also care enough to ask you to raise your hand if they have touched anything sensitive in your mouth. I recommend Mehdi Fotovat to everyone who likes great service and amazing smiles.< /Review>

In other words: Dr. Mehdi Fotovat's Orthodonist office gives the best treatment a patient can have.<//Text>< Response>

Braces. They suck, but the people here are very good at getting braces done and it's all very positive and helpful. Fotovat himself can get a little overenthusiastic at times, but he is amazing at what he does.<//Review>

I was really nervous about getting braces, but after talking to Dr. Fotovat, who explained everything to me very thoroughly, he made me feel very comfortable with the whole process. The office staff was always helpful and pleasant. I'm very happy with my results and the whole experience was a lot less painful than I ever imagined 😊 I'm really happy I went with Dr.Fotovat I don't think my experience would have been as great. I would definitely recommend him to anyone.< /Review>

We think his office is the best place to work as everyone is so KIND, well-trained, organized, welcoming, and always super helpful.  There's always something fun going on in the office-- photo booths, contests, dress up days, spinning prize wheels, and more. My son started 4+ years ago with a palette expander and never once complained (he's a teen!) about going to his appointments.  Today, after 18 months, he got his braces off months much earlier than anticipated. He is one happy, happy, happy 9th grader! The before and after teeth pics are astounding!  Our son's teeth are simply PERFECT!  THANK YOU DR FOTOVAT AND TEAM!  Shout out to superstar Sherwin who was his regular assistant most of these years!<//Text>< Name>

<review>I just completed my adult orthodontic treatment with Dr. Fotovat, and am so happy with my results and the whole process leading up to now. I had a particularly challenging case due to having a combination of an asymmetrical jaw, underbite, curved tooth roots, impacted adult teeth, and a retained baby tooth. I was nervous to start the process and skeptical about the two year estimation, but quickly began to trust when I saw how knowledgeable, professional, and passionate Dr. Fotovat and his staff are. My treatment estimation also included a double jaw surgery, which - although a hard part of the process - I felt totally supported through. Dr. Fotovat went above and beyond coordinating with the three other doctors working on my jaws and teeth to ensure the result would be perfect and the recovery as easy as possible. Sure enough, exactly two years later my teeth are in a dramatically better state of health, and I’m over the moon about having a beautiful smile that I can wear with confidence for the first time! I would highly recommend this office to anyone needing orthodontic treatment.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>My neighbor told me about Dr. Fotovat and how great there team is. I am so happy I decided to get my braces done there. The whole staff seems to sincerely care about the patients. They work with your schedule and are always available for any last minute emergencies. The whole process from beginning to end was very professional and everyone was very welcoming. There was no long wait when you have appointment, they attend you as quick as possible, and always with a smile. I highly recommend Dr. Fotovat for anyone looking for an orthodontist.

<text>I just completed invisalign treatment with Dr. Fotovat and his staff and could not be more pleased with the experience.  They are professional and aways go above and beyond expectations.  They have the latest technology and I was impressed that beyond doing a good job, there is also a very positive spirit in the office and everyone seems to really enjoy working there.  I'd recommend visiting Dr. Fotovat and talking to the staff,  if you are in need of an orthodontist.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I've literally never written a review for anything but I have been so impressed with Dr. Fotovat and his office that I figured I would do so. I am an adult near the end of Invisalign treatment and Dr. Fotovat is great.  Professional, meticulous attention to detail, excellent at explaining treatment plans and generally just a good guy.  He also embraces new technology so he is on the cutting edge of the field.  His staff is really nice, competent and efficient.  I HIGHLY recommend him.<//text>

We had a wonderful experience at Dr. Fotovat's office. Both of my teenage daughters had braces recently. We heard many good things about their office prior to first starting there and everything we heard was true. The staff are all very nice, warm, friendly, efficient & helpful. Dr. Fotovat is very kind, professional, courteous & good-natured.
It was a pleasure these past few years going to appointments. We definitely recommend going to Dr. Fotovat when looking for an orthodontist. We will miss them (especially Suzie).</Text>

My daughter had her braces done with Dr. Fotovat. She just got them off today and her teeth look great.  Dr. Fotovat and his staff are very friendly and helpful. I loved how organized his office is. They made it easy to remember appointments by giving you a printed out reminder and even sending you email reminders a couple days before.  Payments were also easy because they have auto payments.  I would highly recommend Dr. Fotovat if you are looking into getting braces.<//text>

I just finished my orthodontic treatment with Dr. Fotovat and I couldn't be more pleased with the result. Dr. Fotovat is a perfectionist and made sure my teeth were beautiful before we were done. He has also assembled an amazing staff of lovely, kind and professional orthodontic assistants and office staff. I would send anyone I know to see Dr. Fotovat for their orthodontic needs.</Review>

Dr. Fotovat and his team were incredibly helpful throughout the two years I had my braces. The staff always welcomed me graciously and were always available to answer questions and take care of our concerns. Dr. Fotovat made sure we understood the treatment clearly, updated me on every visit, and guided us throughout. The orthodontic team is very welcoming and I highly recommend Dr. Fotovat and his team, thank you!<//Text>

Dr Fotovat is an amazing orthodontist he never made me feel bad  when I didn't keep my teeth as clean as I should or when I didn't wear my rubber bands as often as I should. The scheduling was very flexible even when I had to change it last minute. My teeth came out way better than I could have hoped for. I remember when I first met Dr. Fotovat I was only concerned with the overcrowding I had in the upper right part of my mouth for cosmetic reasons but he ended up not only fixing that problem but also the over crowding at the bottom of my mouth and he made my bite better and smoothed my teeth so they are more perfect looking. All in all I was very lucky I found Dr Fotovat.< /Review>

I was referred to Dr. Fotovat by my dentist. When I met with him I was given several options for straightening my teeth. He helped me decide which would be best and made me comfortable with my decision. The staff was great. They texted me to remind me about appointments. If I needed to cancel it wasn't a problem. Dr. Fotovat made sure my teeth were progressing according to plan. I had my braces removed today and my teeth look great! I used to be embarrassed to give a full smile. I would definitely recommend Dr. Fotovat if you are wanting to get your smile looking good.<//Text>

Dr. Fotovat took great care of my son's orthodontics.  He had severe issues that would have required extractions had it not been for Dr. Fotovat's procedures.  We are completely satisfied with the great, straight teeth that resulted from his consistent, high quality care over the years.  Even more though, on a couple of occasions when my son had a wire break over a weekend, the technicians made special arrangements for us to come in and get a repair.  That's really going above and beyond which is why Dr. Fotovat and his whole team are five-stars+ in my book!< /text>

< Review>
Our son had his braces removed today after exactly 2 years and 4 months of wearing them. He had a significant over bite and over jet. It was all fixed and his teeth look unbelievable now. In Dr. Fotovat's office we found a very friendly team, committed to do their best for their patients.  Dr. Fotovat and his entire staff are the highest professionals one could imagine with the great experience and superior work attitude. We would like to thank literally everybody - Dr. Fotovat,  the office supervisor Daisy, the receptionists, his assistants Maria, Sherwin, Jojo, etc. Everybody in this office is just fantastic. The office is loaded with the most modern equipment and Dr. Fotovat uses all innovations that just become possible. The total cost was divided into low monthly payments with no interest charged, making it absolutely affordable. We highly recommend this dental office to everybody.</Review>

I wish Dr Fotovat and his office could take care of ALL my health needs, they are all so professional, skilled and happy to be there.  They have the latest equipment and technology, and offered payment options that worked for me.  Dr Fotovat clearly cares about his patients and talked me through every step of the 2 year process. I love my results, and would recommend the Invisalign process with Dr Fotovat without reservations.<//Review>

<Review>To anyone who is looking for an orthodontist, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr. Fotovat.  When you first walk in the office it is clean and bright.  The ladies behind the counter are always smiling and cheerful no matter what is going on, and boy do they know their stuff.  There has never been a problem with appointments or information and if you need anything for insurance you can be sure you will receive it within minutes.  As you go further into the office you can see that everyone is extremely busy yet the whole office has an air of efficiency and believe it or not comfort.  You can just feel that everyone is at a place they want to work and are taking pride in their job.  The people in the office have never talked down or bad to/or about anyone, no matter what the circumstances have been.  It is always a very positive place.

Finally we will talk about Dr. Fotovat.  What a wonderful person as well as skilled orthodontist.  He is a very gentle person who knows his stuff.  He gets his point across as well as answering all your questions and makes you feel good about yourself and the whole process. He explains everything and will keep explaining if there are any questions.  He knows what can be done realistically and how to go about it.   He is the type of doctor who takes the time to check each person to make sure the process is going correctly.  There are no false promises. The whole experience has been extremely positive.  Thank you to Dr. Fotovat's entire office. My only regret is that we don't know everyone's name to be able to say thank you personally.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< pics>

I struggled a lot with my teeth and was so scared of getting braces but I will not lie when I say walking into Dr.fotovats Practice was the best decision my parents ever made.I Absolutely love the treatment I received at Dr.Fotovats, it was an amazing experience thanks to him and his wonderful staff .They did an amazing job with my treatment I couldn't ask for more, Dr. Fotovat was able to remove my braces so quickly I didn't feel time pass. Going into the consultory was always such a warm and welcoming experience, the staff was always so friendly and filled with energy. I had no complains what so ever during my treatment. It was so Family Oriented I really enjoyed it and I can say I had quite some laughs. Its always so hard finding people you can trust to do an excellent job with your teeth but I guarantee that there are none like them, they gave me a beautiful smile I could have never imagine having in a million years. I only have praises and good things to say about them. I'm so pleased with my smile and I thank them for everything they did. If you are looking for people you can trust with your smile trust these wonderful people I guarantee they will give you what your looking for.</review>

<review>I had such a great experience getting my invisalign with Dr. Fotovat and all his wonderful technicians and staff. This was my second time getting braces because I didn't wear my retainers after the first go around and I was not excited about having braces as an adult. My experience with invisalign was so much more pleasant than the metal braces and everyone at the office treated me with respect and kindness. Every time I came into the office I was immediately greeted with a hello and a friendly smile. Dr. Fotovat made sure to see me every visit and make adjustments if necessary. I had rubber bands with my invisalign and ran out of them at one point. When I called to arrange a time to come and pick up more rubber bands they informed me that they could mail them to my house. That was very convenient and I felt like they went above and beyond to make the experience a good one. I am extremely happy with my results and get compliments on my smile more often than not. I would highly recommend Dr. Fotovat to anyone who is interested in improving their smile.</review><name>Keren Pinto< /name>< time>

We can all agree that seeking a beautiful smile through orthodontics is a significant time commitment. Choosing braces or Invisalign can be a 2-3 year process. I expected to spend this period of my life inconvenienced by countless appointments and long delays in the waiting room. What I did not expect was to appreciate the experience as much as I did. Dr. Mehdi Fotovat and his staff are the most pleasant group of people I have ever encountered in a doctor’s office. I was always greeted like a friend, not a patient and I never waited for my appointments. Dr. Fotovat is warm, thorough and attentive. As I look back on this experience I am grateful to have shared it with so many kind souls. During each visit to their office, Dr. Fotovat and his team gave me a reason to smile while they perfected my smile. I highly recommend Dr. Mehdi Fotovat if quality treatment and quality of life are important to you.<//text>

<Review>I just completed my traditional braces and Invisalign program at Dr. Fotovat’s practice and I would highly recommend his offices if you are considering any type of orthodontic procedure. Both he and the staff are incredibly professional and definitely put nervous nellies like me at ease every visit! The entire process for both of my traditional and Invisalign treatments were pain free and super smooth, I was always informed on what was happening and more importantly what was going to happen, and it all came out wonderful, I’m super happy with the results! Everyone on staff is extremely helpful and I’ve never had so much as a hiccup during the 2 years of my treatment, it’s a really warm and inviting atmosphere that makes you feel comfortable and taken care of. They’ve got a really great setup there and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to my family and friends.< /Review>< Pictures>

I came in to his clinic about 2.5 yeara ago because he was referred to me by my primary Dentist to have my braces and it was a very good experience from the discussion of what would be the plan for me.

My lower teeth were kinda-like dont wanna be together so it was a challenge.especially when I don't the traditional braces so opted out to have invisilign instead.

What I can say is thank you for Dr.Fotovat and the team for the great job done and I'm very happy with the results. The staff were great and friendly..I will definitely recommend Dr. Fotovat and his team.☺</review>

My first thought having a dental braces was like...I'm too old to have this and not comfortable having this for 2 years. Well, let me tel you. I was wrong. Dental Braces is for everyage. And having Dr. Fotovat being my Orthodentist makes it lot easier and madce it very comfortable. Their not only seing me as a number or client. They treated me as a family. What makes them great is they want you to feel comfortable in everyway. Now that Im done with my braces, I can smile as BIG as I want to cause they did a Terrific JOB! It really makes me look and feels younger everytime I look at the mirror.

I'm loving it! better than Mc. Donald....hehehehe</Review>

Very great place to get your haircut and for a great price too. The place is clean and looks great, the haircuts are great looking and they take their time cutting your hair. They clearly don't rush perfection and I can appreciate that. Only reason for not going 5 stars is that their English was pretty poor so it was hard to communicate what I wanted exactly. But still an amazing price, cut, and place.< /Text>

<Review>The very best place frim a local barber. Please, ask for Vincent, you won't be disappointed.  I have short hair and he is very meticulous.

Nice and clean place too.

Vincent is friendly and professional.  It took me a while to find a place in Arcadia to replace my longtime local spot that moved too far away.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Got a buzz cut and a beard trim here. No wait when I got there. It took a small amount of time to make sure we were talking about the same thing, but once that was done he did an amazing job. You might not think there's much to a buzz cut and shave, but he was very thorough and meticulous. It was fantastic. He really went the extra mile. Pretty cheap, too.< /review>

Very great place to get your haircut and for a great price too. The place is clean and looks great, the haircuts are great looking and they take their time cutting your hair. They clearly don't rush perfection and I can appreciate that. Only reason for not going 5 stars is that their English was pretty poor so it was hard to communicate what I wanted exactly. But still an amazing price, cut, and place.</text>

Nice and clean place too.

Vincent is friendly and professional.  It took me a while to find a place in Arcadia to replace my longtime local spot that moved too far away.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

It took a small amount of time to make sure we were talking about the same thing, but once that was done he did an amazing job. You might not think there's much to a buzz cut and shave, but he was very thorough and meticulous. It was fantastic. He really went the extra mile. Pretty cheap, too.< /review>< response>

I ordered the classic cheeseburger and enjoyed it. My wife ordered the chicken sandwich and it was fresh and filling. Refillable french fries too!!

Great environment and wonderful music (classic Golden Oldies)! We will come back!< /text>< pictures>

Got in quick before my movie for dinner. Our server Andrew was friendly and quick. If you like burgers this is a good place. It has a 50s diner style and they play the music to match. Inside the place was clean and looked really cool. Food was good and fried green beans are my favorite!</Text>

Great breakfast!  The beignets were amazing, like fluffy pillows!  The big breakfast fed us both with food leftover!  The service was good and the food came out hot, quick, and just the way we ordered it.< /Review>

I come to this outstanding place once a month  as I like the  special atmosphere that is characterizes this restaurant. The team is highly loyal and experienced. The service is impressively quick. Most important, the food you get is perfect. I ate there often and I was never disappointed. The cost is reasobable. I recommend this place to to all.</text>

This place is nice! I had breakfast with my husband here and I enjoyed looking at the various planes hamging from the ceiling and lining the walls. The service was prompt and the server was friendly and helpful.
I ordered Egg Benedict, Beignets and a tea and enjoyed it. My husband ordered Cinnamon Roll French toast and enjoyed his too.
I definately see myself coming back here.< /review>

Service was nice but the food was sub-par. Instead of fresh greens for the salad, they used an iceberg lettuce mix. Definitely not was pictured in the menu.</Text>

We wanted a dessert and this is just outside of the movie theater. It was pretty busy but we were sat right away, waited about 10 min for our sundays. Strawberry sundae and brownie hot fudge sundae. Delicious. The food looked good too.<//text>

A Chocolate Malt and Salted Caramel Shake hit the spot for us. I love that Ruby’s also includes the steel metal malt cup so there is no waste. Fried Calamari is breaded tender calamari strips served with cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, and ranch. The outside was golden brown and crisp, reminiscent of the coating on a clam strip. The calamari was tender and very flavorful. A dash of salt was all it needed but the cocktail sauce added a nice tangy, sweet flavor.</Review>

It's the only place I go to locally for my milkshakes because it's the best consistency and flavor by far. I'm not into classic flavors and if you're going to be paying over $5 bucks make it worth it. They have quite a few pre-made shake recipes and you can also create your own! The one in the photo is the oreo cookie fantasy and it is a fantasy indeed 😍< /text>

The Ranch Burger is a half-pound USDA Choice beef patty topped with ranch dressing, Swiss cheese, guacamole (during the grand opening event, it was coleslaw), thick-cut bacon, Montreal seasoning, lettuce, tomato, and pickle spear slices. You have a choice of a grilled gourmet RubyBun, artisan wheat bun, or lettuce wrap. The hubby went with the wheat bun. It was a behemoth of a burger that took up most of the plate. If you have a large appetite or don’t mind taking leftovers home, this burger is for you. It had a nice combination of flavors from the juicy beefy patty, smoky bacon, creamy coleslaw, and briny dill pickle. All burgers come with refillable fries too! Rating: 5/5

The Cobb Burger is a half-pound USDA Choice beef patty topped with thick-cut bacon, melted bleu cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and sun-dried tomato mayo. This has become my favorite Ruby’s burger since the Bleus Burger unfortunately left the menu. When the hubby and I were dating in the 1990s, the Bleus Burger was my go-to every time we had lunch/dinner at Ruby’s. With The Cobb Burger, it’s the Bleus Burger kicked up a notch with the addition of creamy avocado and smoky bacon. My favorite salad is the Cobb so it was just meant to be. I went with the gourmet RubyBun. I just love the brioche texture and shiny, golden brown exterior. I also tried the garlic fries upgrade for the first time and just about fell out of my seat. I love Ruby’s fries and to have melted parmesan and garlic on top of them, just put me in foodie heaven. I think I have to order it this way from now on.

Also the food came out relatively fast so that’s a plus.
I got garlic fries and a burger. I added garlic with my fries I then realized was a mistake (my own obviously) most people that have garlic thing don’t put a good amount but I love garlic so I wanted it to be strong. I added more garlic and it wound up being soupy. I liked the strength of garlic but my fries were soggy in less than 2 minutes.< /Text>< pictures>

Everything was good. I ordered a regular cheeseburger with bacon + fries and my parther got one with onion rings and bbq. He said everything was good. As for my cheeseburger the bread was soggy and my bacon wasn't crispy; we were the only customers there ... but I like to try their breakfasts next time. The interior and tables were all nice and clean.<//Review>

Very disappointing. Fries were cold by the time I got home. I'm not even ten minutes away. Burger was flavorless and they forgot to add there sauce. So I had a giant dry cheeseburger. They don't season their fries so expect no flavor. Unless you really like the flavor of starch. Biggest waist of 13 bucks. Not coming back again.

I'm not surprised to see it as empty as it is on a Saturday in the middle of lunch now. Overpriced Garbage<//review>

<Date>1563303445916< /Date><rating>4< /rating><review>Great tasting food. Service could be a bit better. Overall I'd come back to try other things on the menu. Quick note, be careful ordering kids beverage. Other places are cheaper and display the price. This location doesn't display it and won't tell you until after you get your bill. The only reason this isn't five stars is due to the lack of communication and explanation. Anyway, the food is delicious and the restaurant is nice and clean. A good choice for dates.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>First time going to a Ruby's diner. The decor was cute, 50s style like Johnny Rockets. Food was good, fresh. Drinks were tasty - adding flavors to stock soda is wonderful. Service was good, though a tad bit slow. Will likely return the next time we visit the nearby Cinemark theatre.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1562031858890, 'text': "Hi Joe, Thank you for the kind review!

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I like Ruby’s Diner because as someone who is enjoys the 50’s vibe, this place takes you back. The food is good, and the milkshakes is the best. This place is convenient because it’s next to the movie theater, so you can grab a quick bite. There are many food options to order that are good, but my favorite is the BLT sandwich with fries and a side of ranch. The BLT sandwich bread is parmesan cheese toasted. Another great thing about Ruby’s is you get unlimited fries refills. There’s so many flavors for milkshakes that you need to try them all. Ruby’s Diner has good food and is nostalgic to the 50’s culture.</review>< pictures>

<text>The food was good. The service was.... strange? We had like four different servers, and I don't think any of them talked to each other. There was sort of an odd vibe going on. Each new person who came up had to ask what we were drinking.  When we were ready to leave, we flagged a server down for the check and he just said we should pay at the front. We went up there, and the guy at the register seemed confused about why we didn't already have the check, so he had to look it up in their system. To this day I still have no clue who got the tip. I gave them four stars because in spite of all that, the food was good and they managed to keep the drinks refilled, so I guess it's all good.<//text></record>

I went to this Ruby's restaurant on Tuesday April 16th, 2019. I ordered the chicken tenders. I ate one of the chicken tenders and noticed it tasted funny. I started really looking at them, and I noticed one of the chicken tenders had a big black spot on it. And the black spot was actually apart of the chicken. We told the waiter and thankfully they removed the dish from our bill. However, that one chicken tender I ate has made me sick for 2 days. So obviously the chicken was bad. I'm just writing this review to warn people to watch out for their chicken and potentially other meats. No one should be getting sick over a chicken tender.<//text>

Went to grab a bite to eat since we had a little time before our movie started. Place was clean, quiet, service was quick and food was good. They were offering a small selection of happy hour drinks and appetizers. Cadillac Margarita could use a little more alcohol. Tasted more like lemon honey tea. Cheeseburger and fries were great. Seafood combo with garlic fries was decent. Waitress even brought extra garlic fries for us while we had our drinks and waited for the food. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Strawberry and banana shake to go was thick and flavorful. We will definitely come back for the food,  to try all the shake flavors and if there is room in our bellies maybe even dessert.<//Review>

Food was great but I believe that the staff including the supervisor was overwhelmed with the customers and couldn't get it right. The waiter over charged me and instead of apologizing and finding a way to fix it he kept saying he couldn't get the money back to us for another 2-3 business days. When we told that was unacceptable he threw his tip money at us as of we were bothering him.<//Text>

Went here for gluten free bun since I knew they had it. Found out after the fact that there isn't a dedicated fryer or station for gluten free items. So my fries and burger were cross contaminated.  Oh well. Thankfully the ramifications were not too difficult to deal with. Food was still tasty but the staffs ignorance for safe food handling probably needs to be addressed at this location.< /review>

I remember coming here a couple years back enjoying the food, not sure what it was this time around but the food was not up to par.  As far as the staff, Management is to blame for lack of training.  there was a very nice young lady that just started working there and looked sort of confused when she came to take our order.. when asked a certain question she didn't know the answer and left our table to find the answer but was gone for a lil over 5 min or so come to see her taking food to other tables lol. Thought it was funny. As she came back a second time to take our order with the answer of our first question we had a second question she didn't have an answer to.. she was about to leave to get the answer again but we stopped her to just take everyone else's order first.. However I did like the option of a shot of cherry in my coke. 3 stars indicates I like the place just wasn't what I expected the first time around, but I just can't pinpoint what was different/missing since its been so long.<//text>

<Review>When me and my family arrive no one said anything or seated us for 10 min. As we were walking I almost fell on some spilled ice on the floor no one knew was there. And when i told them  no one said sorry or even acknowledged it. After waiting to be seated waited another 15 minutes  to place our order and there was only 3 other families in there. I know this was an accident bit when she brought our rootbeer floats she spilled it on the table and floor. And not once did the manager acknowledge any of this. I will never return here with my family. Ever< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1566148758715, 'text': 'Hi Donshel, Thank you for your feedback.

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>I attempted for almost an hour to place an order via post mates. I called the diner prior to placing my order to make sure they were open and not to busy, and the host confirmed both. I placed my order twice and was canceled both times by the restaurant in claims that they were to busy to fulfill my order. I attempted calling at least 6 more times and no one answered and the mailbox was full. I'd normally say this is a postmate issue, but my order was canceled by the restaurant itself. Let's just say I wasted my entire lunch break.< /Review><rating>3<//rating><response>{'time': 1561227766061, 'text': 'Hi Istmania, I appreciate you sharing your feedback.

This has been my third time coming. We decided to give this third chance because before we have had horrible experience. We have not been here over three month because we usually get seated and then after five minutes of waiting we decide to leave due to the fact that they are taking a while to even acknowledge us. We have tried to come here before we go to the movie theater and we make sure we come here an hour before to ensure we eat and enjoy our food. Like I said before it was horrible experience twice and no acknowledged or anything from a server for more than five minutes. But today Joannah went above and beyond. She is alone and was able to serve us and many others and ensure that everyone was taken care of. She provided exceptional customer service and speedy service while still maintaining quality on the food. Please continue hiring more people like Joannah so everyone can have this amazing experience before going to the movie theater.< /review>

< Review>
It must have been a short-staffed day on 7-30-2019 at approx 3:50pm. Not many patrons in the establishment. I went in to kill an hour before my movie started. It took ten minutes for me to get a glass of water. After I received my water I waited another 5 minutes to have my order taken. My order was taken and I began to play on my phone... 20 minutes later and I had not been served. I waited another 5 minutes and just walked out. My movie was about to start. Watched my movie and headed to Chilis afterwards... much faster and better quality service at Chilis.</Review>

Not the best place to eat. Food was flavorless, I did not find any flavor on any of the food. I don't know if it was the night cooks but it was not good. This was my first time coming here and they didn't have a lot of options.</text>

I am upset, nay, appalled, not because the food was horrible, but because the food continuously began to disappoint me, bite after bite after bite. the fries were nearly as good as McDonalds, but It was almost as bad as the day my grandmother came out as a lesbian to the family on Xmas eve. But even that had a fair excuse for it’s rude introduction, as me and my boyfriend were waiting for our food, a young little boy of about 2-3 years old walked right next to our table and picked up a French fry that was presumably there from the table before us, and began to take large hippo bites out of it. Like a grown man eating a slim Jim for the first time in 15 years. The young boy then proceeded to walk to the next table, spit out the obviously stale and cold French fry and put it on the table of a man who was sitting by himself. 1 star for food, 10 stars for the little boy who took one for the team and ate the stale fries.< /Text>

<Review>I alway bring my family here at least once a month and the service it’s alway some what slow. But today the service was so slow that after 20 minutes of been waiting for at least our drinks, I asked the server about our drinks and she reply that it was been prepared. The manager, the busboy and server where attending one table while the other guests were left unattended. So I we walked out and the manager didn’t even care. Overall worst service we have experienced at this Ruby’s.<//Review>< Rate>

I am here on Vacation from Texas & have never eaten at Ruby's, food was great, shakes awesome! Service was horrible, we waited 20 minutes to be seated, plenty of empty tables, we we're the only ones waiting, server got order wrong, we had to ask for napkins twice after our food arrived, then we we're privy to one server stating "she was about to go blastic on the other girl if she didn't stop stealing her tables" all this while we needed refills and the correct order. That is why I didn't give 5 stars.<//Text>

It was the first visit to this Ruby's for myself, my son and my nephew.  The burgers were delicious but the fries left much to be desired as they were not seasoned.  The ketchup also had an off putting taste...not sure if it was old. They also have iPads for payment but I was quite concerned when we were show that the bill for another table was on our same ticket.< /review>

Ordered a grilled cheese and a bowl of clam chowder - the chowder was a lumpy cold mess and smelled as though it had gone bad while the grilled cheese seemed like it had just been microwaved. Only positive aspect was the service.<//text>

<Review>Located right next to the movie theatre. Outside and inside seating, no wait for us on Sat night at 530 pm and we were a party of 9. Friendly staff, our server offered us for the frings appetizer fries to go with the rings for free. The shakes are always good and the food too.< /Review>< user>

Well.My reason why my rate ia low because of multiple things 1st i found someone elses hair in my milk shake that looked like either a nose hair or eye lash.2nd i bought a bowl of clam chowder that lloks like it was just out of the fridge and over heated in a microwave.3rd,you have staff stink eyeing everyone who ever got a small issue that its not the customer's fault and just a simple fix wouldn't be a problem,just like mine,someone else's nose hair. Your resturant is brand new.How the hell do you have staff running terribly at customers?</text>

The food is good but the service is weird, Mom and I sat for two hours after our meal, totally ignored, and had to kind of fight to get someone to come over and give us the check. Odd experience.<//text>

I was there one time and promised myself that will never come back, I had the Fish burger, it was cold
,raw and disgusting, The service was OK but if they wants to stay open in Downey they need to improve the service and the food.<//Review>
