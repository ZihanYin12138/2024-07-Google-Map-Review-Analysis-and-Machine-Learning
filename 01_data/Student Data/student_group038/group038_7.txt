<text>I bought a mattress 6 months ago and finally decided it was too firm and I wasn’t going to get used to it. I bought it from Sarah. I went in and decided I wanted a better mattress and Sarah went to great measures to make sure I was satisfied. She exchanged the mattress and didn’t try to push me as a salesman whatsoever. I never leave reviews but Sarah deserves a raise for her caring attitude towards customers.</text>< Gmap_id>

Wow! Thank you Sara W for providing EXCELLENT customer service to me and my family.  We bought two mattresses and box springs today, all within my budget. Sara gave such great deals we were able to buy our bed frames and 2 sheet bundles with pillows and mattress Protectors, still within our budget! I not only recommend this place to my friends, but to all my family as well. They have the BEST deals and I recommend going there asking for Sara, you won't be disappointed! Professional, friendly, and very knowledgeable!< /Text>

<text>Yelena helped me a ton when I was in the store. I tested several mattresses until, once again, I fell in love with the Simmons Beautyrest(almost fell asleep!) She tried several different ways to finance my purchase, but the terms were not favorable for me. My cash back card did the trick.
Yelena was able to track down a floor model mattress for a whopping savings of 50% off! You heard right 50%! It also came with a $200 towards an adjustable base, which I scooped up.

On delivery day the guys were very efficient, picked up my old mattress and box springs(20 year old Beautyrest) Set up my adjustable base and mattress. I'll be sleeping great for some time now!

A good mattress should be a persons 3rd biggest purchase in life, only behind housing and auto. After all we do spend 1/3 of our lives in bed!<//text>< gmap_id>

<text>Sarah was very helpful. I would give her a 10 out of 10. But the pillow came in an open box, i'm not so happy about it. An extra box would've been perfect to protect the beautiful pillow, good thing it wasn't damaged.</text>< pictures>

< review>
I went in on a Friday after work, just intending to look at mattresses. I recently purchased a home and needed a new mattress for the master bedroom. Kira warmly greeted me and listened to what I was looking for. She showed me multiple options and then was able to get me a GREAT deal on the type of mattress I had in mind. She was kind, professional and really helpful. I was able to get delivery of the mattress by Sunday AND the two delivery men (sorry I didn’t get their names) even arrived earlier than expected. They were quick and efficient in setting up my bed. I would highly recommend this mattress store, as well as the two delivery men. This entire process was smooth and enjoyable. Thank you!<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>The best service is knowledge-service. Expert advice comes with broad encyclopedic brand knowledge and fundamental, working-knowledge of the product itself. That’s what I received at this store. This is important because while this is a franchise name, someone invested their money on a brick and mortar to store their products, to be their own boss. I advocate whole heartedly for the community to not only buy local, away from online retailers where your money is concentrated to those with extreme wealth, but buy from an expert and a knowledge worker. I spend my money on local quality!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<username>Jeremy Supetran< /username><date>1594773376552<//date><rating>5</rating><Review>This being my first time buying a new mattress, I was not sure where to start. I am so glad I came to this Mattress Firm.  Hephzibah was awesome.  Upon entry, she was very welcoming and friendly. My fitting started with her asking some questions to address my needs as well as the needs of my pregnant wife, in terms of what mattress best suites us. She allowed me to try out many different mattresses, where she demonstrated her expertise. With her skills and knowledge, we were able to tailor down my fitting, so that I was able to select a mattress that met our needs as well as our budget. Since my wife is pregnant, she was able to relate and further assist me in choosing the right mattress for her. Hephzibah’s honesty, product knowledge, and personality really made this an amazing and informational experience.

Thank you so much, Hephzibah.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808514200f3b01e7:0x124aea024b5d1711</gmapID></record>

I wasn;t in there for hours on end searching. I was attended right away also! GREAT customer service, extremely enjoyable experience!!! I originally went in to test out the purple mattress. Although buying the purple mattress would've cost me more he made sure I had the bed I needed. I ended up loving it so much i BOUGHT TWO BEDS! Thats how much I LOVED his bed recommendation! I walked out with a more luxurious bed and I will sleep happy at home and in my dorm! THANKS KIRK!!!!!!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Great service was looking for a particular mattress because of my Fibromyalgia and the guy in Vacaville recomended a mattress but it was out of Stock so he called the Fairfield store and just my luck they had the one I wanted and it was half off and the guy at the Fairfield store (the one near Mancini's) was very patient because my husband went inside and doesn't speak English so he called me and asked for my info and even helped my husband load it in my van super curtious and helpful at this store will highly recommend them< /review>

Hessy helped me and my wife find the perfect mattress in no time ! I was hesitant at first because she first showed us the display mattresses out in front of the store (usually those are the most expensive but this was not the case) and once we found the one we wanted hessy made the purchase a delight , no haste whatsoever. If your looking for good deals and wonderful service this is the place to go.<//Text>

I had the best experience at the Fairfield Ca store. Hessie was really great and helped me pick the best mattress for my body and budget. I tried out as many beds needEd and she was very patient. That was the best ever mattress buying experience for me. I can’t wait until my delivery comes and I sleeping on clouds.< /review>

Everyone was so helpful and willing to work with me as a customer. The two delivery gentlemen were great. One was K and I don’t remember the other ones name, but they put a mat down and wore covers on their shores so they wouldn’t mess up my house. They were so quick and efficient.< /text>

What an amazing experience!
Came in hoping to fall in love with a mattress, however we had zero clue what we were looking for... seriously no clue.
Luckily J.r was there to help.
He took time to explain the differences in mattress, asked us questions about our sleep preferences etc.
There was no rush, and no pressure.
We never felt that he was trying to sell us the most expensive, but truly cared about finding the best fit for us.
He did just that.
We are now the proud owners of a Beauty rest platinum with adjustable base.
Could not be happier with our purchase, who we purchased through/with and the experience as a whole.
Highly recommend ! Thanks, J.R!!</Review>

<review>I had absolutely the best experience in mattress firm. The manager Tyler made it very easy for  my wife and I to find a mattress we both love.
He was not like your average pushy sales guy, he actually listened to our needs. If you are looking for good customer service I advise you to visit this mattress firm.<//review>< Rating>

<Text>I was extremely pleased with Mattress Firm's service in Fairfield, CA.  I had the pleasure of speaking with Ms. Hessie, who went above and beyond the call of duty to help me through the process of finding the right mattress for me.  Ms. Hessie was friendly, professional, and provided encouraging words (when I mentioned being over weight).  I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation, while all the while she did everything in her power to get me the bed I needed.  Thank you for making this a great experience for me, Ms. Hessie!  I definitely recommend Mattress Firm to anyone in need of a good night's sleep and great service!<//Text><gmap_id>0x808514200f3b01e7:0x124aea024b5d1711< /gmap_id><rate>5</rate><pics>None<//pics>< date>

Came in last customer of the day right before they close ON THE 4TH OF JULY! Instead of rushing me out the door or taking advantage of the little time I had Nate gave me the best customer service I've received in a while. Was patient, showed me different options and even let me know about the military discount without me bringing it up. I went to 4 mattress stores today looking for something to take home tonight and this one was the best store. Thank you Nate and thank you Mattress firm!< /text>

Never have i ever thought that i could receive such fabulous service than the service i received from JR. This man took his time to walk me through the store and explain everything i needed to know in order to make an informed decision.

<review>This morning my wife and I arrived at the 1595 Holiday Lane Fairfield store with my wife giving me instructions that we are not buying anything because this was our first stop. Needless to say after the dual service of Markecia and JR which consisted of extensive knowledge, good customer service and an overall enjoyable attitude; my wife says to me that we are purchasing.  And we did. We’re looking forward to enjoying our new comfortable bed and getting long needed sleep!
We will certainly spread the word to family and friends!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Called on Monday trying to find a clearance purple in cal king. Was told when they come in they go almost the same day and none at any reasonable location. Here's the deal. TYLER AND NATE WERE EXTREMELY FRIENDLY AND COURTEOUS. My wife and I were so impressed just off of that phone call. That we went in on Thursday. And bought the purple 3 brand new and adjustable base. With sheets matress protectors everything. There so great at this store. Got me out of there quickly with a few laughs and way under budget. These 2 were killer. If I ever need to buy another bed. This is where I'm going. MANAGEMENT LITSEN UP. PROMOTE BOTH THESE GUYS!!!< /Text>< rating>

J.R. and Marquisha at this store were so kind and helpful. I came here looking for a new bed for my guest bedroom. I usually hate shopping for big items because of sales pressure. You won’t find anything like that here. Marquisha joked and laughed with me and made me feel at ease. J.R. was also friendly and knowledgeable. I will be coming back to buy a bed for myself in the near future!<//Text>

Aundria made our shopping experience the best from the minute we entered the store.  Her knowledge and customer skills were exemplary!  She is a true asset to the company. We had her undivided attention and were completely satisfied with our purchase.  Would recommend this store to others.< /Review>

<Text>My wife and I came in to price shop for mattresses for our new home. Jenn who was very knowledgable helped us pick the right mattresses. While Jenn was helping us, her manager Kayla overheard the conversation and offered to see if she could find some discounts for us. Needless to say, we left the shop very happy with 2 new mattresses, boxsprings and bed frames. We are very happy with our experience and would recommend Mattress Firm to anyone!</Text>< resp>

We bought an adjustable king size bed with two mattresses from.this store 2 years ago.  We have a problem with the mattresses but couldnt fins the receipt.  Tyler looked it up in a second and emailed us a copy of the receipt and told us exactly how to file a claim!  I didnt expect such great service when dealing with a problem. Thanks to Tyler, pur problem.is being addressed!  Thank you!</review>

< Review>
Anthony at Mattress Firm was absolutely amazing! This was mine and my wifes first ever experience buying our own mattress (we’d been sleeping on hand-me-downs for years) and we had no idea where to start. Anthony did an amazing job from start to finish explaining all of the features of the different mattresses and having us try out all of the mattresses based on our preferences. I could not have asked for a better mattress buying experience. No stress, no hassle and Mattress Firm’s finance options and exchange policies simply can’t be beat. Will definitely be recommending this store to anyone looking to buy a great mattress!<//Review>

<text>Today me and my husband went into Matress Firm to just look at beds, because i have a few issues and we wanted to see what they have to offer. From the moment we walked into the store we were greeted by an employee named Michael Wright, he talked with us, let us lay on beds, asked what we were looking for and just heard us out. He helped us every step of the way, he was really patient too, he was honest and caring. I have never had a good bed to sleep on, he told us about the best bed and about the worst bed. He didnt bully us into anything, or try to rush us, it was our decision, our choice...he wasnt a sales person...he was just normal, nice, informational and helpful. If you go here please ask for Michael Wright, he did not let us down and i know he will not let you down.<//text>< pics>

I want to let everyone know that you can't go wrong working with Aundria at Mattress Firm located on Holiday Lane near In-n-Out in Fairfield.  I went in there with my daughter to find her a new mattress.  She was sleeping on an old Ikea mattress for years and it was time to get her something new to sleep on.
I considered purchasing one of those "Beds in a Box", but the price was higher than I wanted to pay for something I wasn't able to try out before making my purchase.  When I mentioned this to Aundria she said that the "Bed in the Box" is an option for some people who don't have specific needs such as back pain or how you sleep (back, side or face down) required from their mattress,.  It's basically a generic bed without many options.  That made a lot of sense to me.
My daughter sleeps on her back and at first wanted a firm mattress.  As we talked to Aundria she had us try different beds and was very patient with us through the process so we could find the perfect bed for my daughter.  It was so easy!!  I also have to say that the price we paid for the bed at Mattress Firm was less than what I would have paid for the "Bed in the Box".  I was surprised!!  I thought buying a bed at a retail store would be so much more expensive.  I was wrong!!  If you're in the market to for a new mattress please go and visit Aundria at Mattress Firm.  You won't be disappointed!!  My Husband and I are going back to find a new bed for ourselves!!  I'm looking forward to a good night sleep!!!</Text>

We used Amerispec to perform the general inspection of a house we’re looking to purchase. Tom was our inspector and showed up on time and is very personable and professional. His inspection was thorough. Tom did a great job explaining the issues he found and the severity which was really helpful for us to finalize our decision to buy the house. He paid particular attention to areas we wanted him to look at. I would definitely recommend AmeriSpec and Tom.< /Text>

Our Realtor recommended AmeriSpec Inspection Services and we are glad he did. Brian, the home inspector, paid attention to important details & provided a very thorough inspections. He has pointed out several items that may create safety problems if they were not fixed. We appreciated him in giving us a verbal summary  & asked if we have any questions at the end of his inspection. The written report was very detailed and we really appreciate his services. I'd highly recommend AmeriSpec Inspection Services.</text>

Dishonest as they come and would never use again. We used them for a home inspection in August 2020. We had used them previously (in 2011) and thought that they did a decent job then so we tried them again for this home. It was a mistake. Let me explain.

Just after closing escrow on our house we discovered several problems that the inspectors should have easily caught and so allowed us to negotiate their repair before closing escrow. Among the problems was two windows in the house not closing correctly (or at all for one of them). The inspectors apparently failed to open the windows and Justin, AmeriSpec's owner, basically confirmed that in subsequent communications.  The inspectors also allowed the homeowner to follow them around while telling us that we could not be present during the inspection.

I contacted Justin (the owner) directly to make things right. He brushed me off for over a week before presumably hiding behind an attorney to ghost write his response. The email blamed me for his inspectors' failures and claimed that his inspectors followed the American Society of Home Inspectors' (ASHI) Standards of Practice. Big mistake on his part.

The ASHI Standards of Practice point to problems with the two inspectors. For example, ASHI Code of Ethics 2C says that “Inspectors shall not disclose inspection results or client information without client approval.” Yet AmeriSpec's inspectors disclosed basically everything to the homeowners—who were not the clients—before disclosing them to me (the client). Not only that, we never gave AmeriSpec authority to disclose the results to the homeowner. But they did in a verbal report.

On the inspection date, my wife and I waited approximately 20 minutes outside the house waiting for the inspectors to finish when the homeowner walks out and says, “Well, everything checks out. It’s just an old house.” Come to find out, the inspectors allowed the homeowners to be present during the inspection after AmeriSpec told us (the clients) that neither we nor anyone else we could not be present during the inspection “due to Covid19.”  The specific instructions AmeriSpec office sent via email include, among other things, the following:

- Client is asked to show up towards the end of the inspection.
- Client is asked not to follow the inspector around.
- Client must wait outside of the property or in their car until the inspector has finished the inspection.
- The client is the only person (other than the Realtor) that is allowed to attend the inspection.  Friends and family are asked NOT to attend.
- The seller/homeowner/tenants or anyone else living in the property is asked to vacate for the entire inspection.

My wife and I wanted to be present but again AmeriSpec told us we could not be there. As we understand it, the homeowner followed the inspectors around. So no wonder the "representative" number of windows missed the broken windows as the homeowner presumably steered the inspectors away from those ones. (When there's only two windows in the downstairs bedroom, it's highly improbable that the inspectors completely missed the broken one without being steered away from it.)

Had we been present for the inspection--as we requested and as was our right as AmeriSpec's client--then we could have easily opened the windows that the inspectors did not (if they really were not going to not open each one). And we would have done so.

AmeriSpec ordering us not to be there--only to then permit the non-client homeowners to remain present, follow the inspectors around, and receive the inspection results--killed our bargaining power for repairs.

Justin still has not even attempted to make things right by providing even a partial refund of what we paid.

In short, AmeriSpec does shoddy work but hides behind an industry group's practice manual (ASHI) to say that it's doing its job correctly. But when you look into it, AmeriSpec doesn't even follow ASHI's standards. They're just out to rip you off.<//Review>

We hired them to inspect the property before we purchase it. The report came very clean with no issues or minor issues. When we moved in, we found out that that was far from truth. So many major problems with the house inside and out and it sounds like they didn't even check anything. It is obvious that they are very busy and just go through the check list as formality and don't do a thorough inspection. They charge an arm and a leg but they won't even do the work. When I reached out to them and told them about the issues, they brought up all kind of excuses. They gave me a lot of run around and point fingers at the seller, at the repair contractors or anybody in the world other than themselves.
This company does not add any value for you. They get your money and don't do anything for you. If things go right, you are lucky and you don't know anything and they keep your money. If things go wrong, they don't take any responsibilities for their negligence and you need to spend a lot of money to overcome the issues and they still keep your money. Look somewhere else. Think twice before using them. They are con artists.< /Text>

{'time': 1603571794853, 'text': "Dear Whistle Blower,\n\nMy name is Justin Woodford from AmeriSpec Orange Coast Inspection Service.  Thank you for taking the time to review our company.  While I respect your opinion, I can assure you that we are far from con artists.  There would be no way we could have stayed in business for 32 years as such.  And not to sound argumentative, but there are quite a few limitations when it comes to inspecting homes.  Also, and unfortunately, sellers aren't always honest and do try to hide things.  That's not to say my inspectors are prefect.  Merely, I'm trying to explain the limitations.  Regardless, I do apologize we did not live up to your expectations and I'd like to make it right if I can.  If you would reply to me privately, jjwoodford@amerispec.net, and provide me your name and the property address we inspected, I'll do my bust to help.

We were desperate for a last minute inspection and luckily we found AmeriSpec! The customer service was amazing and we were lucky to have such a great inspector! Our inspectors name is Keith Beard and he was so so so helpful, I would recommend not only this company to anyone but also Keith. With all of covid going on he was wearing a mask and maintained a 6 feet distance while still showing us and giving us suggestions. He was very professional and kind, he offered us his personal information just incase we had any questions after the inspection. Overall, great service! Thank you AmeriSpec and Keith! :)</Text>

Our inspector was very prompt and reliable. He offered suggestions and answered all questions about the inside and outside property. He explained in a way that was easy to understand and I felt comforted by knowing what I was dealing with. He was very personable and friendly and made the experience quite enjoyable.</Review>

<Text>Rudy Swigart is awesome!  In a time where customer service has been lacking, Rudy has dispelled that myth with his responsiveness, attention to detail and just overall caring.  I can't say enough about Rudy and his willingness to serve the needs of people who require his services.  He should be commended for his work and I truly look forward to working with Rudy for many years to come.  I will definitely recommend him to my colleagues and my community.< /Text><response>None</response>< UserId.>

<review>AmeriSpec Home Inspection exceeded our expectations. The inspector was very helpful in explaining all observations, gave suggestions, and showed us all important operational and safety functions of the home. After the inspection, we were provided a very helpful link to the "Home Binder" web site tailored specifically to the property, including suggested resources for home maintenance, repairs, etc. I would highly recommend AmeriSpec!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I have been in the Real Estate Business as a Broker for a very long time and have never had an inspector not willing to answer a question I have about a report that was completed for a prior buyer on a home that my client is currently purchasing.  In fact, Dario Salz wouldn't even take the time to listen to the question which had nothing to do with the actual findings in the report because he stated " I was trying to get a free inspection".    It was merely a simple question about whether or not the windows were inspected as they are never mentioned in his report.  I have to assume that they were inspected but who would know since he couldn't take the time to listen to the question.  You have a lot of options when it comes to quality home inspectors locally and because of this conversation, Amerispec would not be on my list of recommended providers.< /Review>

Very bad experience. I used them to do an inspection before buying a house. A year and half later I had water leakage issues, I had 3 licensed contractors give me their professional opinion and to my surprise all three asked "when did you buy the house, who did your inspection? They should have notified you" their lack of knowledge, and care cost me  thousand dollars to fix the walls. I called their customer service they said the owner will call me... Never did.</Text>

<review>Amerispec  is truly Unprofessional, deceiving and unpleasant company to deal with in this  industry.  I am a home buyer who hired this people simply because I did not know better. Inspector walk through the house  just like a gust and   basically did not do inspected the house, even though they were charging me over 155.00 over their competitors .  They charged me additional 100.00 for pool inspections and inspector even did not turn the pump on to verify if the pool is in working condition. I had to point out extreme discolorations of bottom of pool to him to notice. Fireplace was out of his way!!, therefore he did not inspected that either. Almost everything was out of his inspection range or he simply was lazy enough to look at them. All his attention was to get my signature for not suing them and charge my credit card (may be he had enough experience to know his work is subject to question) . Dealing with this people was a disaster and  even they agreed to refund me 300.00 for they shortcoming,  which they did not honored that either , the owner hang up the phone on my face.
Dear Realtors, stay away from this company which is not truly inspectors but full of shortcoming and unlimited lack of professionalism and customer service.
This is my first and only review that I ever posted  regarding a company which i received service from and I do not know how much useful  it can possible be for this company and other future clients of them.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Scheduled a home inspection about 10 days in advance.  Found out gas would not be on at the property, so I informed the inspection company that gas would not be on but I still wanted the inspection for water and electric and would check the gas on my own when gas was hooked up again.  Amerispec tells me that that's ok and that water and electric are the really important ones to check out and that they would be unable to look at the gas appliances which I agreed to. Day of inspection, he is not there when I arrive about 10 minutes early.  About 15 minutes after the scheduled start time, I call and ask what's going on, they say he had an earlier appointment and may be running late, no big deal.  I get a call minutes later from "Jimmy" who tells me he showed up 25 minutes early, saw the gas was not turned on for the property, and just left and was now 25 minutes away from the house.  I explain the situation of me calling and saying that I wanted to have the inspection anyways, he gives me the runaround on the phone that he heard nothing about this, claims to have called my realtor and got no answer (my realtor was with me on the property), and that he wasn't able to be there anymore since he had more appointments later in the day.

Horrible customer service, poor communication, no contact when an issue was found before the inspection was supposed to happen, he didn't even stay for 15 minutes until the actual scheduled inspection time when we showed up for the inspection to discuss the property with us and the issue of gas not being on.

Waste of my time, waste of gas in my car to drive there, and has now caused kinks in my home buying process.  Would not recommend to anyone, will also be calling to issue a complaint to to the company via phone when they decide to answer my calls again.<//Text>

<review>I'm sorry to hear about all the bad reviews with the guy named Jimmy, but I wouldn't write off AmeriSpec at all. Last year we bought our first house and had AmeriSpec do the inspection. Our inspector was Ed Mullin and he did an outstanding job. His report was very detailed and thorough and he pointed out a lot of things to me in person (I walked around with him as he did the inspection) that were useful to know, not just for making the purchase, but also to be aware of for future maintenance. In fact, I was so impressed with Ed, I called AmeriSpec back today to have Ed do an inspection on a condominium we own so that we can prepare it for sale.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

This place is delicious, I love their sandwiches. The only thing is I think they clean their sandwich board with acetone or something because it smells like it. Other than that fair prices and creative donuts.</Text>

This place has the best breakfast bagel sandwiches and donuts. I always get the bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwich, make it a combo for like $1.50 extra and you get a donut and orange juice. For around $7 you can’t really beat that deal. It doesn’t hurt that the people working here are also super friendly.< /text>

Ordered online to be delivered, (by post mates). The driver got lost but no big deal. The donuts i recieved were no where even near the donuts I ordered... turns out if you order "1/2 doz donuts" you should call and actually tell them exactly which donuts you want or, even tho the site says you can pick there, or they just do a random selection. So the girl I talked to there, Gabby, not only explained it all to me but she got ahold of the delivery company, after I had tried for half an hour, got my order refunded, and then offered me another half dozen on another day! THAT'S great customer service!! I will be ordering again but NOT with a delivery service!!< /text>< Pictures>

This dontbshop has been here for 37 years a family owned place .Husband and wife ran it they know everybody's name and your family when you were greeted by them the donuts are outstanding but a few months back the husband was murdered in his home not too far from the donut store  ...very sad indeed ...after this very tragic incident they sold  the business to other family members the donuts are great but it is just not the same as you could imagine they only stay open till noon.< /Review>

Our whole family makes the weekly weekend visit to Roses. The breakfast sandwiches are affordable and tasty. We always get combos that include donut holes and a drink. There is a high chair there for the little ones too. Just remember that it is cash only.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>The chinese family that owns this place is always so friendly and ready to take your order. In the early morning, this place can have especially long lines--even on the weekend because their donuts are really good. Their donuts are always fresh, not greasy, and have just the right amount of sweetness to them. Their cake donuts as well as their fried-donuts are both things to look forward to. One of the best things about this place: they serve mega-big donuts here in select flavors. I love buying those and bringing them to people because they never expect donuts to be the size of their heads!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbffe3ad98a949:0x7b0bad3ef97e60cd</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Really delicious and very FRESH Donuts!  Lots of variety and great flavors to choose from.  Totally worth the stop while you're in this part of town.  Their Vietnamese iced coffee was also very excellent.  Fast service but, cash only so don't forget to bring at least 10$ cuz these donuts are some you will want to take a few extra with.<//text>

They have donuts.  That's good for at least 3-4 stars.  Cash only.  They have the whole gamut from tiny to enormous.  Don't go here if you are on a diet.</Text>

Always excellent service, always excellent sandwiches. They do a good job at letting you modify your sandwiches how you like them!</review>

First time here and boy was my sandwich delicious. So much so that I ate 1/2 of it before taking a pic! Mr. Pickles offers lots of  choices and so many breads to choose from too! They make their sandwiches chocked full of goodness. We'll be back soon. This is a Club (subbed bread to toasted Marble Rye). Delish & comes with a complimentary cookie-can't beat that!<//text>

This was my first time ordering from this places it's pretty hidden. I had an avocado sandwich was pretty good on a Dutch crunch..everything tasted pretty fresh.  A good price as well, just wished there was a bit more organization with pick up orders and people whom are ordering on the spot. Maybe a 2nd register to assist with the to go orders.  Still recommend to try.< /review>

He immediately said they would make a new sandwich. When I got to work I saw he even put a cookie in the bag for me 🥺 I thought that was so sweet and thoughtful, couldn’t resist writing a positive review for that! Plus the sandwich wasn’t too bad either 😉< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>This place was a great find. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It was my first visit and she gave my a very good recommendation. You have to try the Dutch bread the crunch is unreal. It still is incredibly soft when you bite through the sandwich. I had this bread with the Mr. Pickle sandwich. It featured hot 🐔 breast 🥓 and 🥑. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and stop by. It's located behind the Enterprise office. @memosmunchies IG for 📸<//text><user_name>Guillermo Guerrero< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

The works includes Mayo. Pickles. Tomatoes. Lettuce and peppercinis. They are accommodating to sandwich modification. The staff is friendly and fast.<//text>< rating>

Didn’t eat here went in it smelled horrible, the young women stepped up to answer a question that I asked to a young man ( who’s eyes were like a deer in headlights ) she was nice and friendly but the vibe my wife and I both got was less then happy of the staff for working there
We did not eat here and will never.  Also your online does nit mention that merchandise is available online only.<//Review>

Amazing sandwiches! Suggest ordering online to shorten the wait. I have never had an "ok" sandwich - they're all amazing.
Dutch crunch bread is the go to, but again all are great, fresh and flavorful.

The Mr Pickle sandwich is my go to. Meatball is next. But I've had nearly everything on the menu over the years, and love this place. Most (all?) meals come with a fresh chocolate chip cookie and a pickle wedge.

You'll never go back to the other brand names once you've had a Mr Pickle.
Beware, lunch rush is busy. Be early or late or prepared to wait :)

Covid statement:
They're following protocol well.
In person ordering line\queue begins at the counter, closest to the door.
Then next person stands at the wall
Line wraps towards the drinks fountain.

If you've ordered online (recommended), go straight to the back, opposite side of the cash register. If you look closely you'll see a doordash sign. Go there if you used any means of online or app ordering< /text>

The best sandwich shop in ALL OF OC AND CALIFORNIA. I would go here all the time as a kid in Northern California, so glad there's a SoCal site. Definitely better than the Hat.< /Text>

This is the only Mr. Pickle's I have been to, but apparently, it's a chain of restaurants. The service has always been well-above-par. The food is really good and, of course, you can't beat a chocolate chip cookie at the end! It's in a strip mall retail setting with parking available, but not a ton.< /review>

The Yelp reviews are not wrong. Mr Pickles sandwich shop is fantastic. I went with their traditional Mr Pickles chicken sandwich in Dart bread. It was full of flavor and very filling too. And the staff was friendly too. If there is no security guard at the bowling alley next door, I would recommend parking there. Otherwise the regular parking lot can be packed and you'll need to park in the street.<//review>

Excellent service, fresh, and signature. Get everything on Dutch bread. The Mr pickle sandwich is outstanding, not a bad thing on the menu down to the mac salad. A hidden gem. If u want straight classics go to teddy's deli but if you want a unique twist, go here. It's the kinda food you'll never find in corporate neuter gray Irvine.<//review>

<Review>I haven't been here many times, but every time I go, they either charge me more than what I ordered or want to recharge me for the order. My mom has been here twice, and both times, if you PAY IN CASH, they charge you more! This time, they tried charging me again and the lady while preparing my sandwich was checking her phone.. which in any other place is all good.. people have lives, but while making my sandwich, she was touching my sandwich and her phone and her pockets. Pretty disgusting.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>You've never had the best sandwich of your life, until you've had Mr. Pickles! Dutch Crunch bread is their signature, but it's ALL good. Ask for garlic sauce, too!<//Review>< gmapID>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Let me tell you - if you haven't tried a Mr. Pickles sandwich yet, you owe it to yourself to come by and by all means - get the Dutch bread. The bread is baked fresh and toasted for warm sandwiches and is amazing in and of itself. They also throw in a freshly made chocolate chip cookie with your order too which is great for us sweet tooths. The menu items are all pretty great (imo) but there is also a secret menu that's unlisted. I recommend the kickin chicken and anything with Pastrami in it ~ and they also have a vegan & vegetarian option as well.👏 Seating is limited and just fine for a lunch option, but otherwise this place is my new #1 sandwich joint!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>This is your run of the mill mom and pop shop. If you Googled "hot sandwich shop" you probably came across this place the same as i.

My biggest feed back is for the employees and management, do not stick the end of the hard tomato core in sandwiches. No one, and I mean no one, likes biting into these things.

Secondly, because you do not offer complimentary water and have a $5 limit to use credit cards, we went without drinks this trip. May I suggest either allowing patrons to know you do not have water/water cups if you see them ringing up without drinks.

Otherwise, the food was pretty good as well as the service. Thanks.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dce86621469a3d:0x5abe305cd2cd3563< /Gmap_id><user_name>Alex H (Avalloch)< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Their sandwiches are always good, but parking can be a bit of a pain.  It also takes a bit longer than some of the other sandwich shops, but I think the quality is worth it.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Mr. Pickle's in San Luis Obispo is the BEST!  Our youth orchestra was going home to San Bernardino from a concert tour to Cambria.  Mr. Pickles coordinated with our "manager" so that we could pick up our lunch & run....which is what we had to do because we were running behind schedule.  The sandwiches were AWESOME!  Fresh bread!  Condiments on the side.  Homemade cookie!!!  Our resident vegetarian was in heaven!  They were great to work with on our extremely limited budget (which our "manager" was happy about).   If you want a great sandwich at a great price from a great group of people, be sure to stop by Mr. Pickles in San Luis Obispo!  Thank you Connie & Curtis!</review>< pictures>

<text>Well, my Tire Pressure light came on while driving on the 405. I stopped here since it was the closest place. The assistant at the time, Trevor, was really friendly and helpful. He checked all 4 tires, added some air, and even replaced a couple of the valve caps that were missing at no cost. If I lived nearby, I would definitely go back to this place due to its great customer service.</text>< Pics>

BE CAREFUL! Double check that what they are quoting you actually needs fixing. 'My car would over heat and I was told that my radiator was cracked which I couldn't afford so I kept driving on it. Took it to another shop to get the oil changed and I was told it was overheating because I had no coolant and there was absolutely no crack in sight and there was air in the container it's been a few months and hasn't over heated yet. Good service and people but they will never get my money. I spent $900 getting my car fixed a few months ago and I wonder if even needed half that stuff now.<//text>

Guess where I'm going to get oil change or new tires next time!? Also, it's right next to the big Westfield mall, so you got something to do while you wait.
Next time I'm going shopping there I might as well have them look at my truck!< /Review><response>None</response><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

I can say only but thanks..

I had my break fixed somewhere else, and forgot to ask for a oil change , well decided to go to this business and asked for the oil change,

then the technician came to me telling me that the breaks work was not not properly done  and that the breaks could have been failed if I entered into the freeway..

That was a surprise, this people at this place saved my life.. and of my family...

You got a loyal costumer with me and my family and also friends cuz I will recommend this place to them surely..</review>

This place is awful
They said it will take 2 hours to repair my tier and when I came after 2 hours and half they told me it is not ready yet, guess what!! They didn't start even..and when I asked the guy why? He said I told about 2 hours and he was so rude and the surprise that his manager was rude too. Lol
The problem is when they got the car on the track and started to fix it guess what!!! It's not repairable lol..it's not that only they don't have the tire lol
This place is a big meSS
I WISH MY COMMENT REACH ONE OF THESE MANAGERS UP THERE
thank you</review>

After an oil change, they gave me a laundry list of repairs "I needed". New brakes, rotors, waterpump, shocks, etc. The noise I complained about (which they couldn't hear) when I accelerated was attributed to the water pump. (huh?) I went home to research online and found out they are NOT to be trusted.

Months later I went to a near by Goodyear. I got the oil changed, I told them about the noise. I asked them for a brake inspection and an inspection of the water pump and shocks. An hour later, brakes have plenty of life, one shock has tiny leak and can wait, water pump is perfect and the noise they narrowed down to a transmission problem. They referred me to a Dodge dealership since I was still under warranty.< /Text>

<text>NO WIFI!? How do you have a waiting room these days that does NOT have wifi for customers?!

Also, the woman at the counter was curt and not very friendly.

I won't be coming back to this location - there are plenty of other locations nearby.< /text>< gmap_id>

There are 6 charging stalls but only 3 work!! The one I'm in, the one to my right and the on on the far right. I hope they fix it soon since there's no others along here. For food choices, there's a Mexican, Thai, and a Burgers/American< /review>

Only charged once. The charging power was 75% of usual Supercharger power despite only half of the stations being used and it took longer than expected to add miles. It feels like Tesla should provide more clarity on power available at Supercharger stations if they are not all the same.
Not a great rest area but a Grocery store and a coffee/burger and Thai dinners are nearby.< /text>

<Review>I guess this place is chosen by early Tesla road testers. They definitely need to expand or add another location along highway 58 for east-west commuters. Can get crowded and low current easily.<//Review>< rate>

Chargers are pretty quick but not the best for food or restrooms, local Stater Bros has an ok restroom and there is a Mexican Grill next to the chargers....

Thought for the day.

I saw a charity appeal in The LA Times the other day, and it read, 'Little Zuki has to walk 13 miles a day just to fetch water.' And I couldn't help thinking, 'she should move.'"< /Text>

This is a great station location in the desert with some good food options nearby. Just to the idiot saying the station should be in Tehachapi. That makes no sense! This station is perfectly located on the way to bishop from la.</Review>

Not much here besides a Mexican restaurant, furniture store, and grocery store. Chargers were mostly empty though so charged quickly.</Text>

Efficient supercharger which gets the job done.  Food choices are Mexican or Thai.  There is also a grocery store across the parking lot.< /text>

It's way off the beaten path and is in a dark and unkept parking lot.  I can't believe anyone would give this even a one star!  Why not have one in Tehachepi where there's a cute downtown and a great German restaurant?  I wish we had a choice but we can't make it to Barstow from Harris ranch with the 90d.<//Text>

This was a very easy and pleasant stay for my sleep test.  Nichole was just a great person with a great personality to administer the procedure.  The condititions for a good sleep were above my expectations, and I had a good night sleep.  And, there's a Starbucks just a few blocks away for my required morning brew!< /review>

<review>I went there with my 17 yo son to get a sleep study. Since he’s a minor I had to stay with him which was fine except wasn’t happy that I slept in a chair. I was offered a cot and told I could sleep in bed with my son but like I said he’s 17. Needless to say I didn’t sleep well because of the sleeping arrangements. It would have been nice to have a bed even a twin would have been more comfortable. The tech was awesome! Very knowledgeable and friendly. Overall good with exceptions on accommodations for parents taking their teenage boys. Would have been different if it was me n my teenage daughter but not my son.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

The home test was easy but I wonder if it gives the kind of data of a true sleep study. It seemed rather shallow as a study, but if it gives full data, I guess it's okay. The equipment was fine and the staff was professional and courteous.<//Review>

The facility was very nice, almost like staying in a hotel.  The tech on duty (Dane) was very professional.  Explained every detail as we went along and was very reassuring. I did put on the CPAP about halfway through the night and not having used it before, it took some getting used to.  Again, Dane was very supportive.< /review>

I was amazed at the professenalism and friendliness of the staff. They explained what was to happen and quickly disspelled my anxiety. I  fell asleep quickly and had a wonderful night's sleep.  The facilities and bed were clean and comfortable. Only 1 problem..nobody gave me an explanation of what to expect.  No written instructions either.  Need to get this information to patient!<//review>

Well. That's over now. I came away with a CPAP and all interactions with Advanced Sleep Medicine people are bogged down and fraught. No one speaks English. They won't answer the phone, my supplies are 3 months out of date and no one can help me. My multi-thousand dollar CPAP is now a doorstop.< /text>< userid>

My husband and I were there last night. The two techs were knowledgeable and put both my husband and myself at ease. The building outside is well kept up. The accommodations were clean and comfortable.  I now know why I'm tired most of the day. This morning is the best I've felt in YEARS!
This is the place to go  if you need to be tested for sleep apnea.</Review>

<review>Terrible experience. The guy Sleep technician was rude.
At the end he is very reluctant to wipe out connection points over the head and face leaving you go home with horrible looks of messed hair and face while going for everyone to see coming back from a horrible place.
But when I insisted was rude gave me tissue paper telling you have to clean your self.
I said I can’t see what is over my head then he was very rude and reluctantly or half heartily partially wiped making no difference still left me going home ugly looking face.

I said why did you not having small hand towels available then He blamed  the management don’t give any towel.

He didn’t know how to wrap around blanket around the feet leaving me with cold feet.

He had mask set on high pressure causing more disturbed sleep and messing up with the sleep results/assessment. He is very angry and rude guy more over how Sleep results could be reliable.< /review>< Pics>

This was my first experience with Santa Clarita Auto Sound.  I drove 30 mile (San Fernando Valley) to have work done on my Volvo SUV.  I had S/C Auto Sound do chrome delete on my entire car (front grill, window trim both sides, the roof rack, both driver/passenger side mirrors, and rear hatch cargo step) and install an amp and a sub to my stock sound system.  Very happy with the results.  The work looks like its factory OEM.  Price was reasonable and fair.  Professional business, no shady employees (unlike some of the Auto Sound stores I've dealt with in the S/F valley who barely speak English and lie to you all day long), good overall experience.  I highly recommend this place.<//review>

I recently brought my boat to Santa Clarita Auto Sound, I have for years wanted to update and improve the sound system in it I just never knew how, and thought the amount of custom work would just be way to expensive for me to afford.  I contacted Santa Clarita Auto Sound, who was referred to me by my boat mechanic.  When I dropped the boat off,  I discussed my needs and was assured that they could take care of everything I wanted.  Let me Tell you that the end result was better than I imagined, and the craftsmanship of the custom parts was exquisite.  They answered all of my concerns and checked to make sure that I approved of any custom installation that was not originally discussed, they even were able to accommodate a quick connect amplifier system. As many boat owners know when we store our boats theft of such Audio systems is a big problem.  I would definitely recommend Santa Clarita Auto Sound to anyone.  I think that you will be more than pleased with their work.</text>

Thought this place seemed legit until I became a customer. I paid well over 300$ to replace (2) door speakers that should have been 5 x 7. Omg!! I ended up having to replace them within 2 months!!! Found out the only 5x7 they put in my vehicle was the mount to fit a 5 & quarter speaker!!! I don’t have the time to go back but really I wouldn’t want to. I took my 300$ loss but DONT DO THE SAME!! Go SOMEWHERE ELSE! Oh yea, when I called the place, they said my receipt didn’t say what size speaker! Ya, I bet it didn’t< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1624390895912, 'text': "Hi Jennifer, we apologize for any inconvenience. I believe we scheduled a few appointments right after the installation to go over your concerns but you never showed. I believe we also spoke with your husband and assited him with all your concerns more than six months after the purchase date. He had mentioned that you had a sound system installed from another shop and didn't like the sound coming out of the previous front speakers. Unfortunately we weren't aware that's the reason you wanted to change the speakers. In this case it wouldn't be the speakers but more likely the sound system installed from another shop that's giving the bad sound. We usually custom fit the best sounding speakers. The speaker sizes would be on the receipt. Unfortunately If you're not able to show up for any appointments it's difficult for us to help with any concerns you have. Please reach out to us at (661) 286-1100 if you like to discuss anything further."}< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2870592159c89:0x9a666c267a7fdb22< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We just had new speakers and amps installed at Santa Clarita Auto Sound. Everyone loved the music it was so much more clear and crisp. One particular day we went to the sandbar and three different boats had their stereos on  and they were blasting it. We fired up our stereo and turned it up and everybody shut the stereos off they just got blown out!< /Text>

Just had a new system installed and it came out great.  I explained that I wanted a clean sound with good clean bass without distortion or bass that was overpowering.  The system turned out great and the sound is exactly what I wanted.  Great job !!< /Review>

<text>The shop is very nice and the staff was very nice as well. They were very knowledgeable in everything they sold. The prices are also great I saved quite a bit on the alarm I had installed. As I waited I looked around at all the inventory they got it all. From low budget quality sound systems to high end set ups. This will be my new one stop shop!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Great job and clean work.
A little more expensive than I would have liked but everything is working well. Would have also liked to receive a manual for the camera and module features. Thanks!!</text>

Excellent service and customer relations.  I have an old car and they were able to put a new alarm system in at a reasonable cost and remove the old one.  From the first phone call through installation everyone at Santa Clarita Auto Sound was stellar.  I will be visiting them again soon to have a keyless entry installed in my grand daughters car.</text>

<Review>The folks at Santa Clarita Auto Sound were very helpful selecting an awesome sound system for my budget. Had a little glitch or two arriving at the sound shop when the installation was finished, which Santa Clarita Auto Sound promptly fixed... Got in my conveyance and turned the system up LOUD with some hi-fi jams, and a big smile spread across my face hearing the GREAT sound. Getting in my conveyance without a sound system meant non-stop fits of road rage. Now, getting in my conveyance is a joy, and the mellifluous sounds coming from the system Santa Clarita Auto Sound installed always puts a smile on my face. A little thing or two I wanted adjusted, and Henry offered to do it for free.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I’ve been coming here for years! Brought in both of my cars for stereo upgrades Over the years. David and Henry and their staff have always done a great job with the work they perform.  They take pride in what they do and they always try to satisfy me the best they can ( which can be difficult at times  since I’m a perfectionist).

If you love your car the way I do, I would definitely give them a try!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Went in to get my sound system checked because there was a weird noice . They charged me 75 dollars just to tell me it was the wiring but that in order to fix it I needed a whole new radio 🤔. I went to a different place and they fixed it for 50 dollars . I wouldn’t recommend Santa Clarita Auto Sound they were just trying to get me to spend more than what I needed or could afford 😡. They took my 75 dollars for doing nothing !< /review>

It's very good that the owners know thier stuff very well. I wanted to have my wheels powder coated. I chose yellow for the powder coat and they offered me to add some yellow racing stripes as well. The result is very cool. I'm getting a lot of compliments from my friend. Great job guys!!</Review>

Over the year, I had a couple of upgrades made to my car; Stereo upgraded with Apple CarPlay + Android Auto, added Rear parking sensors, backup camera. Followed by Sound Deadening installation which has made the car cabin that much quieter and feel more luxurious !  Excellent customer service by David & Henry for the recommendations and following through to make sure the work was done per my expectations.

I would recommend this place.</text>< Pics>

Excellent experience using these guys!  I know good work when I see it and their work was superior.  I waited while they installed a radio.  The installation was very clean.  They made all of their wire connections like a surgeon.  No sloppy work done here.  My father used to own a repair shop so I appreciate when work is done correctly.  The owner was a professional and gave me a fare price.  I will recommend my friends here.<//Review>

<text>I have only great things to say about Autosound! I have been using their services to all of my vehicles for the past 6 years and always get a superb quality and costumer service!

In the past month they installed a brand new fully customized stereo / GPS system (with backup and from camera) to my 2017 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and also a backup camera to my daily driver a Honda Civic 2012. Both jobs done perfectly and within a very timely manner.

About a week after the install I got a message from Henry to follow-up and see how is everything is going with the new system and backup camera and overall to make sure I'm satisfied - that is really great that they take the time to actually call and make sure everything is working great!

I highly recommend Santa Clarita Autosound for all of your car needs! I will be happy to keep doing business with them in the future and more then excited to recommend them to everyone!

<text>I wanted to upgrade my bass system. I searched the web for any good ones when my brother said that why not go to a place that sells one directly. He's got a point though, so I drove around the area to find one. I went in and had a talk with Henry, who seemed to be in charge at that time. He showed me some really cool systems and explained the difference with everything to me. I am impressed at how knowledgeable he is. It is better than having to read them on the web. He also gave his suggestions for my preferences of music. We agreed on his suggestion. They were quick, I got it done in the same day and I'm quite impressed with the results. I am thankful that this was my first choice.</text>< user_name>

< Review>
Finding Santa Clarita Auto Sound is like finding a gold mine.  This place has the nicest, best and most professional guys who work in the car stereo service industry.
I commend them for everything they did for my car. They were the ones who installed a brand new audio system, complete with amps, subwoofers and speakers. Aside from this, they gave my car a remote start, alarm and a high-tech navigation system. I got all of them on a reasonable price.

These guys completed each installation project with great efficiency. They gave full attention to details to make sure nothing could go wrong. They took good proper care of my car. They left zero marks or scratches after every job. Most of all, they were fast. When I left my car to install the brand new audio system and later that day, I was able to drive my car back home while listening to music using the newly installed audio system.

I really like the results they have given me. In fact, I have been recommending them to my friends and acquaintances. And those who took my recommendations thanked me for telling them about Santa Clarita Auto Sound.

Overall, I have found the best car stereo installation service in California!< /Review>

While borrowing my dad's car for a trip, I surprised him with a birthday gift of not only an upgraded radio, but some new speakers as well. Santa Clarita Auto Sound did a phenomenal job with both aspects and were super friendly in the process. I'd highly recommend them for any job.< /text>

Great customer service by Santa Clarita Auto Sound. I much appreciated the way they deal with their customers. Suggested the right car alarm Viper 5704V for the safety of my car. I was surprised by the functionalities of this two-way alarm. It lets you command and monitor your vehicle with simple to operate user interface.</review>

<Text>I bought my car from Southern California (for some reason it is always cheaper in Cali) and it did not come with the premium sound system in it, so I really needed to upgrade it. I love listening to music in my car, plus I drive around 30 minutes to get to work usually. I am sure people who drive a lot know the importance of the music while driving, especially if you drive at night time so it keeps you awake.

Anyway, I wanted to upgrade my whole sound system, plus navigation system and a backup camera because mine was a basic model that did not come with any of that. I knew I was going to spend a lot of money, I just needed to find a place that could do a quality job.

I did a lot of research and found 2 shops. Santa Clarita Auto Sound was the one that was very flexible with scheduling and their prices were lower than their competitor. This particular shop was a little bit far but in the end, it was definitely worth it. They gave me a detailed quote and all the prices on phone. That was the last shop I called, after what I decided to make an appointment. They installed new speakers, two subwoofers with a custom box, amplifier and a navigation system with a backup camera. I got a very good deal for all that and they took only 1 day to finish the job. These guys did a great job. I just love the sound in my car and I really enjoy listening to music now, don't even want to compare it with the sound that was in my car when I bought it. These guys truly have a passion for what they do and are very knowledgeable.

By the way I've already recommended this shop to all my friends and wanted to leave a note here too.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2870592159c89:0x9a666c267a7fdb22<//Gmap_id></record>

I got a brand new car (2015) and decided I wanted a car alarm installed. I drive pass this place every day and decided to go check it out. I did my research on car alarms and prices before going in. They were up front and honest about the process and price. I was told it would take 3 hours to install my alarm and it only took 2. I was told if I had a problem with it to bring it back and they would fix it for free. I've had it for 4 months and there hasn't been a problem. Everyone was nice and courteous. I would definitely recommend this place, in fact I have to my co-workers.</Review>

Complete sham worst place ever to buy audio equipment from make sure you get everything in writing about their return policy and how they operate.  Because they will lie and cheat to save a buck. If you wanna be taken advantage of  This is the place for you. Their sweet demeanor when you go to buy something changes into a thug mentality when you try to return it<//review>

The last job that they've done for me waswhen my father want a new car stereo for his old car and he asked me if I knew someone or some company who could get the job done. So I recommend Santa Clarita Auto Sound because they did a great job on my car 2 months ago. So we drove into Santa Clarita Auto Sound's shop and they did some talking to my dad and they made a deal. A team of professional worked on my dad's car, and dad said that he can’t wait for the result. As expected, they installed all the sound system and car stereo perfectly.  It sounded nicely!  Another job well done for Santa Clarita Auto Sound.< /Review></record>

<Text>Recently, I have spent quite a bit of time at Santa Clarita Autosounds. First they installed a fancy radio but sadly it was stolen from my car (in my garage!). What is wrong with people??? So they installed another lovely, very fancy radio in my car. Both radios were excellent!!! It was fast and easy to schedule the installation(s). They explained the radios clearly and I could actually work them. No small feat for me. I've been back two times, once to adjust the audio on the hands-free and again to have them pair a new phone with the radio. In both instances they walked out and did it on the spot and told me (with a smile!) there was "no charge, it's just part of the service". They are totally professional and able to give very clear, easy to follow directions. In general, I'm intimidated by these sorts of places and on first glance I was here as well. These folks look very serious, but you are greeted immediately when you go in the door and they are very interested and helpful. I'm just not a tech savvy person but they were undaunted and quite patient. By the end, I felt pretty smart and competent......and there was not charge for that either! If you're in the market for audio, you can't go wrong here. I can't say enough nice things!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Absolutely love my new sound system. They have friendly staff and provided prompt service. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is my car was returned to me dirty. My car is black and I keep it spotless. It had finger prints all over the trunk and spoiler (due to installing Satellite Radio And back up camera), large smudges on the windshield that appeared to be elbow prints, and a water ring on the roof from someone's drink! Seriously?
Other than that, I'm very pleased with everything purchased. It feels like a new car with all the upgrades.</review>

<text>Had a really good experience with these guys. It's been more than 2 years I use them. First, they made a custom box for me (that's something to see). Then I brought my wife's car for a backup camera. Couple of weeks ago installed an alarm system and a window tint.
I use them so many times and they have never given me a reason to turn to another place.  These guys know how to keep customers. KEEP IT UP!!!<//text>< pics>

To me this is the best shop for alarm systems in Santa Clarita. Got an alarm installed in my Jeep last week here. I'm very happy I could get this deal, they gave me a good price both for the unit and for the installation, plus they are the only preferred Viper dealer in Santa Clarita, so I know I'm safe in case something happens :)< /Text>

<review>The did an excellent job and did it very quickly. I have only 1 complaint. I brought my car in because there was a short in the system which was not originally installed by them. The charge was $150 to find the problem and fix it. Once they found the short in my passenger door speaker they suggested replacing the speakers as the models I had were not so good. I agreed and bought a set for $275 they then told me it would be $95 to install then new speakers I said shouldn't that be covered by the $150 charge since the labor to remove my door panels was already done they would not go for that. So the moral of my story is if I walked in and said replace my speakers the cost would have been $125 cheaper for the same service preformed. I will say they do a very good job and I would return in the future.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1528310174882, 'text': "Hello, thank you!

I can't live without my remote start, love being able to operate it from my smart phone no matter where I am. Much more personalized service than I've experienced at other stores and I don't have to worry about the quality of their work. I also feel better shopping at a family owned business that'll put that money back into the community especially since the price is comparable and selection exceeds other places.< /review>

The owners are friendly and helpful, they installed a triband Ham radio in the trunk, threaded the wires to the control head and mic to the dash. Then Installed the antenna mount. The trunk install was done with the USB port easily accessible for laptop frequency programming , they ran the speaker wire back up to the front seat and placed a switch in the center console to go between the stereo and the 12V speaker So I choose to listen to the stereo or the Ham rig or both at the same time.  Clean install! It looks factory. No problem with it for two years. They tinted windows on three cars for me and installed a Boom Box in my son's Benz then tinted his windows. I used a gift certificate they offer for my son. I like this shop it is clean and well laid out, the work bays are clean and organized. I send friends there and purchase gift certificates for friends.
They have a lot of Product lines. No Ham Radios or Scanners but they did  the best install on a Ham rig I have seen in 30 years. I just explained that it puts out several watts on transmit, made sure to go over wire choice and location, it was ready in three hours.  AC6AV</Review>

Yea I'm not coming back here. I came here to get a car alarm with installation. I walk in and 3 people are behind a counter just staring at me not saying anything. So I say "I'm looking to get a car alarm." The guy in the middle says "okay" nothing else. Like a douche bag. The guy next to him comes around to help me but after that I wasnt gonna spend my money there.

Here's a tip to those employees: when a customer walks in you say "how can I help you?" It's pretty easy.

Needless to say they watched $600 walk out that door. Idiots. Never spending my money here.</text>

I have upgraded my car stereo with Pioneer AVH-270BT and it works well for me. The Sound is too good and you can play music with anything. Had a great experience of Listening music in my car. The Technicians made the installation smooth and described me the functions of my new stereo so gently. I can’t imagine myself without this stereo system while driving. My Family loved it so much. Thanks to Santa Clarita auto Stand.<//Text>

These guys are real professional. They help me with my sound system that I purchased from another shop that I paid too much for it. They fixed my sound system and installed one for my friend. My friend paid half the price and got a better system and window tint.<//Review>

<review>About a year or so ago, I had Morel brand speakers installed to replace my factory stock front door panel speakers. I was told they were custom designed for my BMW.  A few months later, my window tint on my left window was damaged because the speaker was scratching it. I had them re-position the speaker and repair the window tint - which they did for free (I later had the tint re-done by someone else because the work was poorly done). A few months after that, I had work done by Al & Ed's in Canoga Park because one of my Morel speakers stopped working. Turns out one of the cross-over wires became disconnected and after pulling the panel they took pictures and showed me how Santa Clarita Auto Sound basically Jerry-rigged the installation using pieces of wood in order for the door panel to be pulled away so the speakers would not block the path of my window regulator. They even put pieces of carpet taped on the back of the speaker magnet so the tint wouldn't be scratched.  Seriously? Custom made for BMW, huh? I'm having the speakers replaced next week. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Good Experience!!!! Tried Kicker 43TCWRT84 subwoofer. I am a hardcore music lover. With my existing car speakers , the sound was good, but I wanted to add some more bass in my car.Seems like I have  Incorporated style with power from Santa Clarita Auto stand. My friends are getting crazy for it. The Marvelous experience of listing music while driving to an office or home. The Sound quality is amazing. At last, it was a good deal for me .Really loved it.

Being a touring musical technical professional, with a focus on guitar system configuration, I ended up cursed with an extensively trained and absurdly finicky ear. I was never satisfied with any system configuration or tuning that I had assembled or had installed in my vehicle(s). So when it came time to, again, attempt to satisfy my craving for flawless audio in my vehicle, I shuddered. Along came Henry at Santa Clarita Autosounds. I went in. I met Henry. I was jaded and apprehensive. I gave the short speech about what I do for a living, etc. and postured myself (rather arrogantly, actually) as an educated consumer, not to be swindled. I stated what I wanted and a budget. I was stunned at the response. I was greeted with something that I hadn't experienced before. Ears. This guy was actually LISTENING to me. I couldn't believe it. Henry was patient, professionally consultative (which I really related to and quite liked) and funny. No "close 'em" attitude at all. He went to work, exploring and explaining options that all fell within my stated preferences. I settled on a system and took a chance. Boy, am I glad I did. I (and my pesky ears) have never been more satisfied or happier with the result. Henry has never played any sort of games with me. And believe me, I would know. He is courteous, professional and put the stuff in (and tuned my vehicle's audio response - really cool) in a timely manner and pleasantly within budget. I highly recommend this business.</Review>

One of my friends recommends Santa Clarita Auto stand for me to upgrading my car audio and alarm system. I was fascinated with the products they have. I am quite happy with the new Pioneer AVH- 4100NEX and two-way alarm Viper 5704V. Both are amazing products. Cheers to Santa Clarita Auto Stand for the unbeatable experience.< /Text>

My stereo broke a few weeks ago and I went into the store since I always see it on my drive to work.The sales guy Henry really helped me out. He helped pick out what I needed and they really got my car in and out super fast. I was expecting it to be a pain with the scheduling and all but it was in and out on the same day. This place is good.</Review>

I wouldn't even give this place a 1 star they installed a stereo in our truck and backed it into a yellow pole and left yellow all down the side of our black truck and said that they had video showing that they didn't back into a pole, so I asked to see the video and they told us that we waited too long and they didn't have the video anymore which is not true they backed into the pole and it shows they just don't want to pay to have it fixed or buffed. The installation garage is filthy they have poor customer service and when u call they put u on hold forever HORRIBLE HORRIBLE place I will never EVER go back there again.</Text>

Got my stereo back it is working fine BUT they did a bad job re:installing, the frame of the stereo kept popping out and the center counsel puckered had to take the car back again and before I forget they forgot to put the trunk lining back!

really the worst. one auto door lock stopped working within a week, and my car went dead that night from miswiring from the alarm installation. this was on an uncomplicated 1968 ford. they also installed speakers which i later found out had to be rewired because of problems.

on top of that, the day of the job they wouldn't even complete the entire job of putting in a hood lock sensor because they didn't want to pay their tech the overtime, even though they quoted that as part of the job which would be done within 3 hours. they expected me to drive back a roundtrip of 50 miles because they didn't want to pay someone overtime for 40 minutes.

i wouldn't even go back to them for the hood sensor, which i paid for, or the broken door lock. that's how bad they are. when i put a review on yelp i received messages from others who had horrible experiences and pursuing legal action. many positive reviews you see are padded...you can tell the real reviews such as this one because of the specificity of what they did wrong as well as how many '1' star reviews there are...that's no accident. plus,  the low prices in their ads are loss leaders. i was extremely upset over the entire experience with these people.<//review>

Santa Clarita Autosound does it with lower prices and does a better job.
I got my new radio/backup camera installed at Xtreme Autosports and it only lasted 6 months after the warranty expired, they didnt really offer any kind of solution for this, so now the money I spent is down the drain. Payed 750 when Autosound offered me the same for 450. My bad for not doing the research beforehand. You guys rock. 🤘🏻</review>

<Review>I waited a little while to calm down before writing this. Having said that, I still WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place even it was the only one in town. There are other places around town that deserve your business more than this place, believe me! So as not to insult anyone, even though it is well deserved, I will just stick to the facts. Within the past few weeks I had tint service performed here on my car. I called around to get estimates before choosing a place. This place was more expensive than any of the others I called. But they gave me a 20% discount over the phone and could get me in the same day, so I went. I had the tint installed, but I had to bring it back the next weekend to have them replace some tint film that had been scratched during installation.

After getting my car back the second time, I went home and the car literally stayed parked in the garage for two days. On the third day I decided to wash the car, which is when I noticed hard impact paint damage under the front bumper that appeared to have been touched up by a shoddy paint job. I'm not talking about a few small scratches either. So I took the car back in to show them the damage. The person I dealt with the whole time was.....let's just say the person was family to the owner. My experience with this person got really ugly. After a long debate with this person about how my car could have been damaged, I decided to agree to disagree and I would just voice my displeasure through he channels I have as a consumer. I was calm as I could be the whole time (but SO not happy), and I even told this person I was leaving because we were not going to agree. But this individual kept trying to disprove the notion that they could be responsible. That's when it got ugly.

All of sudden, as if a switch were flipped; this person was pointing at me in a hostile manner. I advised this person to stop and they complied, but then went on to raise their voice and call me crazy. Well, I wasn't letting this go by, so I said.....well, let's just say we said good bye to each other with some profane expressions. This was as bad as a customer service experience gets.

Now, I can't prove they did this, but I left the car in their possession and came back later. So, I'll let the reader draw their own conclusion. What would you think if you took your car into a place for service and got it back in different condition than you are certain you brought it in as? Yes, I did write the owner and I have not heard anything from him. But, I'm not surprised. It is so hard to find just GOOD customer service, I'd even settle for average service. So sad!!! You can risk it if you want, but I don't know why.</Review>< Pictures>

⚠️⚠️!!BUYERS BEWARE!!⚠️⚠️
I came into this establishment to install a system in my cars my car was already pre wired due to the previous owner. The previous owner ran the system with no problems and hadn't needed to buy a new battery.
Saturday I went in to have it installed I told Henry that the car was pre wired and I asked him if anything needed to be replaced to let me know because as much as I don't want to spend the money I want it done RIGHT. They came back and said that it would cost 50$ to replace wiring behind my radio so I paid and Throughout the installation I asked Maral and Henry if everything was ok and if anything needed to be replaced or changed they insisted however, that everything was "Working Fine" with no suggestion the the current wiring was unfit for the services. Installation went as expected and I drove an hour back home that night, but before I could get off to my EXIT I started to smell what I eventually found out was a smoking speaker and my radio would shut off and come on at random. When this came to my attention I called the establishment. 5 times at 1813 to let them know I needed to come back and have the service replaced but no one answered however I was able to get in contact with David via google business messages he assured me that my life wasn't in danger and that I should have them take a look at 1000 on monday.

Monday came and I was there at 1000 as instructed from there I gave Henry the keys to take a look and less than 30 seconds later he came inside the store saying that there is something wrong with my battery, after asking what he did to my car and telling him that I have 0 problems starting my car (he too had no problems starting my car Saturday)and that my battery is fine, I went out and it STARTED with NO PROBLEMS like a brand new model. So I went inside and asked Maral if David can take over looking at my car as Henry is essentially being untruthful. After going back and forth with all 3 of them when I was speaking to David they asked if I wanted to talk to a reference of theirs who has a problem with Battery Terminal Corrosion they also had interstate write a note stating they needed to replaced so after SC Autosound "fixed" the sound system and replaced the subwoofer (They Offer No Warranty, No Refund) I went to a nearby automotive mechanic and had the terminals replaced hoping that everything was good to go and I would return for more services.
By the time I got home again the sound had yet again went out but this time no smoke. So I called spoke to Maral and she instructed be to come back so I did and made it there around 1630 but they close at 1800. They again looked at my car but this time they said that I would need to buy a new wiring 39-59 from my battery (the same one that Henry said "works fine" but made no suggestions to replace) and pay for the 65$ labor after I already spent 420.47 just to get this far and that I would have to return tuesday to get the work properly done as they "didn't" have enough time.
I wouldn't trust recommending  this company with a pet fish as they obviously don't thoroughly check their work nor the welfare of components pertaining to the Autosound assignment and don't take responsibility for their faults.
David also disagreed that when doing mechanics and electronics on cars disconnecting of they battery isn't needed which is NOT CORRECT. Any good car mechanic of any kind knows to disconnect at least one terminal of the battery when maintaining certain duties such as the expected.
Monday night would have been the time to pull in some extra hours and get things right with the customer (at little to no charge) as it never was from day 1 but instead I was expected to drive home and back to the establishment to pay full price for services that should have been done day 1. I will make sure I nor anyone else I know spends another penny with them as this company is not to be trusted. Other customers that I came in contact with while waiting for my car to be done and abroad can agree as well so the 4.5 stars they have now are fluffed.</Text>

<Review>Normally I shop around for the best price on everything I buy, but after buying speakers from Santa Clarita Autosounds I refuse to shop anywhere else. They always give me awesome prices, they have a great selection of top of the line brands, and most importantly, they have excellent customer service. The helpful staff is really what keeps me going back whenever I need parts. Henry is a great guy to deal with. He's got tons of knowledge and has no problem sharing it. He's always got time to answer all my questions and point me in the right direction with product and mod advice. While building my system up I wish I had started at Santa Clarita Autosounds instead of wasting time at less helpful shops.<//Review></record>

Crap. Staff working there hardly knows about any of the products they sell. They sold me a subwoofer that was too weak for the amp (which doesn't make sense to me, you'd think that could only happen the other way around, but I'm not the professional), which burned out the sub within a week. When I take it back that's what they tell me. The sub was too weak. Oh, the sub YOU recommended to me isn't compatible with the amp you also sold to me? Great.

Staff was also quite rude when I asked them to look at an old sub I had. I told them the person who gave me this second-hand sub said it was a $300 sub. They laughed at me and said no, it's definitely not. Very professional.

They installed the sub in my trunk and forgot to clamp/bolt it to the backseat. I had to ask them if they bolted it and the guy seriously says this; "Oh, you wanted it mounted to the backseat?" No, I wanted it to be sliding around my trunk until something punctured it. Now here's the kicker, they did this the first time AND the second time when I had to get it replaced due to their screw up.

The only reason this crappy place gets 2-stars is because the actual installing staff did a good job, I mean my car hasnt blown up from incorrect wiring and the sub *does* work. But the front-end sales staff is god awful.<//text>

I've never written a review but I'm really upset with the customer service and broken promises of this business. I bought headrest DVD players. I told the manager they were for long trips away with my family he said 650 out the door. But it was not I was charged tax turned out to be $700. three weeks later went on a trip 20 minutes on the freeway they stopped working. He had set them up to the FM radio. According to other businesses i could have done this myself. it wasn't set up threw the car. He said he would see what he could do and sorry that they did no returns. Months have gone by of me calling and calling. just recently he told me it be another $200. this is so ridiculous. I could have got the factory DVD players set through my car dealer for $1,000 and he knew this. I will never buy anything there again. I don't recommend  this place to anyone</Text>

Henry & David helped to install new head unit and speakers in my CRV 2010. All the connectors (bluetooth mic,  radio antenna, dim settings) are connected well and functioning properly. David recommended kicker speakers CSC67 with 25% off deal. Kicker speakers sound great compared to original stock speakers in my CRV.  Cost of the parts and installation is priced reasonably.<//Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>BEWARE!!! DONT GO HERE!!!Terrible service. Missing tabs, panels not screwed in, and 2 interior lights not working after install. They refused to acknowledge it was them and insist the 2 bulbs went out. They even have video of interior pre install that proved it but they claim it's too blurry to tell. I had to buy the 5$ tabs to replace the ones they obviously lost. PATHETIC they wouldn't shell out the chump change to satisfy the customer. Static-y sound coming from audio, and sound level is really low for having an amp. Wish i wouldve just had bbuy do it for 50 bucks more. I had this exact system installed on a car before, and this sounds nothing like it. Very disappointed.</Review>< pictures>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>The work they did was ok. It was the best price "Quote" i got anywhere so i went to them. They gave me a price for the viper car alarm over the phone which include instillation, then when i was there they told me i also need this other part thats $100 for the remote receiver to work! what!? thats like giving a low ball price and then jacking it up when i get there, for it to work!!! not cool. it also took 2 days after i dropped it off in the MORNING and was told a few hours!

Other than that, it was okay. Would i go back? maybe, but ask all your questions first and make sure its everything cause i consider what they did to be pretty shady!!!!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<username>Aaron Wace</username><Date>1472963534214</Date><rate>5</rate><text>I usually don't take to time to write these reviews but after my recent experience if felt compelled to. If you need any kind of stereo related work done on your vehicle this is the first and only place you should go. It's the only place I'm going to from now on. I used to be loyal to another local shop in Santa Clarita by the name of Xtreme Autosports. They lost all future business and recommendations from me to this place. Went in to get a frayed factory iPod cord replaced on my Mercedes Benz C63, after getting a horrendous quote and poor advice from Xtreme Autosports for $250 labor and $150 for the genuine Mercedes cord making a combined price of $400 just to be able to plug my phone into the cars already standard feature, what a joke. I stopped by this place and was impressed with the very neat, clean, high quality show room and staff SCV Autosound has. After a very short wait was greeted by Henry the owner and asked him to take a look at my situation. Long story short he gave me a very very fair price of $75 for labor and $65 for a Genuine Mercedes Benz iPod cord straight from the local dealer's parts department. Dropped the car off around 9:30am on a weekend and within 2 hours it was already ready to be picked up. The job was performed flawlessly, I was a little scared about any scratches or dents on the factory unit or dash board especially since Mercedes are very complicated to work on at all but everything was spot on. He even left the old cable they replaced in the bag of the new genuine Mercedes cable on the passenger seat as proof I was getting exactly what he sold me. Afterwards I couldn't figure out how to navigate to the AUX input for the iPod to start actually playing my music since the car was new to me. Henry took to time to sit out in the car and figure it out with me and ultimately he did and now I finally have all my music! Hands down recommend this place whether you live in the SCV or not. All the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I'll definitely be back for work on my Lexus and any other friends or family that need stereo help or work are getting sent straight here by me in the future. 110% satisfied. Don't waste your time going anywhere else, especially with Xtreme Autosports (Xtreme Ripoffs)<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

The guys at santa clarita autosounds were the most straightforward and honest. They didn't push anything and tried hard to understand what I was after. I gave them my budget and they went out of their way to get me the best value possible. They gave me good advice and made me feel as if he could call on them for help long after the sale.

<time>1405793995201</time><rating>5< /rating><Text>I've been going to Santa Clarita Autosounds for several years and have purchased an alarm system and two full stereo systems for both of my vehicles. David and Henry were extremely helpful and patient with me when making my decisions and setting up my game plan of what to get for my cars. I went several times to check out different combinations over the course of a year without even spending a dime and got full assistance every time until I was ready for installation. Santa Clarita Autosounds does an excellent job with installing their components in such a clean and professional way as to completely compliment your vehicle. Their prices and installation rates are very reasonable. In total, I have purchased two head units, full replacement speakers for two cars, alarm system, and a custom mounted amp nicely concealed in my quarter panel. I will definitely be paying Santa Clarita Autossounds another visit for my subwoofer install down the road and I am looking forward to dealing with excellent customer service interaction with them once again.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2870592159c89:0x9a666c267a7fdb22<//gmapID></record>

David the owner and staff are AWESOME! I brought my new car to Santa Clarita Auto Sound based on the reviews that I read online. David explained to me in a technical yet simple way I could understand my options to upgrade my factory stereo. I ended up taking his advice and getting a Kenwood Amp, Woofer and installation. I am extremely happy with the entire process. David is a true professional and I found that his professionalism is rare in the industry. I went to several other stereo shops before Santa Clarita Auto sound  and turned away from each of these other shops due to what seemed to me as an industry standard of un-knowledgeable sales people and sales people talking to me as if I dont know anything about sound. David, the owner of Santa Clarita Auto sound appeals real quickly to your senses as a guy who knows sound quality ver y well. He impressed me quickly by showing me that he understood what sound quality I was looking for and explained how he could make that happen in my car. Simple and very professional. Anyway, I couldn't be happier with my Kenwood setup. It was a great decision and money well spent. You will be very well taken care of by David and his crew if you buy here. Five stars all the way around. Highly, recommended!</Text>

Took forever just to do a tint on a Honda coupe , and the guy had my brand new car running while he did it so he could have the air on, and when I asked him about it he lied straight to my face!!! Plus he left my brand new car dirty as well.<//review>

Jack gives the best hair cuts, you can trust him to cut your hair well while also informing you of how different cuts will affect the texture of your hair. Sherry does the BEST eyebrows. I always get compliments whenever I get them done from her.< /Text>< Pictures>

Jack is one of the best barbers💈I've had the pleasure to go to. I've been having Jack cut my hair for more than 15 years now and wouldn't change that for anything. He's an amazing barber!</Review>

I generally hate going to hair salons to get a length change, but this place was great! He didn't question me a bunch of times about whether or not I was sure about the length change (from below the shoulders to above the ears) it was super quick and exactly what I wanted! Maintenance and styling is a breeze now!</review>

Good place. Nice haircuts and friendly people. The best thing I like is that Sherry would never cut your hair as per what she thinks is good. She will only cut as per whatever you have asked, would never cut even 1/4th inch extra of what you desire. Would ask you and go along slowly. They are very patient people. My husband also goes to same place, he is also happy with their service</Text>

0 stars of I could. I had went camping and my hair becme kniytted in the back from not brushing.The rude lady denied fixing my hair for me because to her it would take half hour just to comb and she told me to comb out knots first and then come back to get haircut but I had already called ahead asking them to do that and offered to pay. Soo unprofessional and why would they want to loose money.shouldn't a hair dresser know how to detangle and also have good customer service? No straight up embarrassed me and wasted time and gas money. I think she just wanted to hurry to to go home. And it wasn't clean at all she didn't even clean up the hair from the person before me it was gross.< /review>

Jack is amazing! I have long hair and always get compliments on it! Even from cheerleaders since I work in schools. Once I paid $70 for a haircut and I have to say Jack did a much better job and he only charges $15. I always give hime a tip!<//review>

Xpect to get an inexpensive and quick haircut.  Just remember, sometimes you get what you pay for.  I think this is more of a clipper shop.  $15 for a 20 minute haircut (no shampoo).  Not horrible, but, alas, not great either.....<//Text>

Quick, friendly service. I got the large island bowl for $11.95, and I couldn’t finish it. It’s huge (32oz). Flavor and texture is average but the size makes up for it. Maybe it’s because I just went to Oahu and all the bowls there are now my standard to go by. Nothing beats Açaí bowls from Hawaii.

Still, this is a good corner shop to go to. Good vibes!</Text>

Won't let you place an order for pickup over the phone. If I have to install an app, use some delivery service or wait in person while they prepare my order, I'll just go somewhere else.</text>

Decent tasting bowl but the teenagers working there were using the same gloves that they were handling cash and handles with... to scoop fruit into my bowl.... very nasty and I hope they get training about hygienic food handling. My appetite was very much thrown off.<//review>

Açaí bowls here are legit. It’s located near the mall so plenty of parking everywhere. The line was long because the weather was beautiful but we didn’t mind waiting. It was worth it.<//Text>

So to beat the wait, I order online, yet 2 out of 4 times it's still not ready when I set a pick up time for 30min. The amount of food you get is not always consistent... Sometimes you get a full bowl, then next time you barely get it halfway, and they know it, so they try to cover it up with a banana and a half... And if you look around, it's pretty dirty in there..

The island bowl here was really good.  However the prices for Acai bowls in general are becoming extravagant unfortunately, not just this place but many are charging a lot for them.<//text>

Very nice breakfast. The acai sherbet in the bowl makes the whole thing taste like a fresh breakfast desert. Nice balance in the bowl. They do not just take a bunch of fruit and throw it together. We had the spartan muesil and the berry bowl. And you do feel good after you eat it.< /review>

Without a doubt the best bowls and smoothies in Santa Barbara... or anywhere actually. The ingredients are always fresh, the texture always consistent, and it's just delicious. I'm a fan of the classing and simple berry bowl but I sub out the honey for brown sugar and get it without Gogi berries -- the texture of those pesky little berries doesn't lend itself well to the rest of the bowl in my opinion.< /Text>

Wish we'd discovered this place sooner, on our 2-day trip to Santa Barbara. The menu is so vast and inspiring. If you're dragging yourself to diet, walk in here. The menu, the people who come in (their 6-pack, toned, ripped physique), the endless choices, the reasonable price : it's a win-win!< /review>

<Review>I liked. It doesn't look like a lot of food but the big one is enough for lunch and is delicius, almost all of ingredients are organic and is really fast.< /Review>< Date>

Island Bowl is to die for. Nobody has been able to duplicate it. The fruits are fresh and it's worth the price every once in awhile.< /text>

A sip of Backyard Bowl’s Pitaya Smoothie in Santa Barbara, California re-energizes me and my palate in a way no other cold beverage can. Yes, this includes alcohol! Everyone out here in the West Coast is finicky about their smoothie’s consistency, ingredients, boosts, whey, soy, milk, or green-ness but all I want is a great tasting drink that happens to be good for you too. All hail the mother of all smoothie flavors, the dragonfruit!</text>

(Translated by Google) Very good! Really an excellent breakfast. But be careful if you don't eat a lot. The quantity is generous, you can even share the smallest portion.

I just paid 22 dollars for a burger through Uber eats. That's it. Just a burger. I paid the extra fee so the delivery was supposedly faster. When the 22 dollar burger arrived, it was COLD. Not warm, not cool, but COLD. I was super hungry so it did not make sense to re order. Flavor was okay... For a cold burger!< /review>

It's my favorite local vegan fast food restaurant. It's all vegan and my favorite part is that the wrapping the food comes in and all the cutlery and everything is compostable which is great for the environment and makes me feel happy and at ease. One other plus is that the food is very filling and their vegan shakes are unmatched. The fun part is that the have a new vegan shake every month and the flavors of the month for December are 3 festive flavors. The staff is always very friendly too. I highly recommend this local vegan fast food treasure 💫</Review>

Great service and speedy process! Love this whole restaurant chain so much. Not to mention everything is planted based.

I would highly recommend.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I have been wanting to go here for a good minute. Its awesome to see a vegan place have a drive-thru rather than just being another temporary food truck.
In terms of taste, the burgers are good! I had the bacon cheeseburger and I absolutely love the bacon (I think its beleaf). The chicken nuggets are good with the sauces but the nugget itself lacks a little flavor (maybe paprika, garlic powder, and salt?) in the batter but otherwise is an awesome addition to the meal. Soda is tasty, I had the blueberry soda and it was pretty yummy and unique.
Overall a great meal, would go again.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>Lifelong vegetarians craving the Big Mac experience and former omnivores who long for their lost Double Double will love the Big Zack from Plant Power. I've had tastier burgers for the price, but none as authentic to the drive through experience as this one. Avoid the lightly sweetened milkshake if you can still stomach dairy as Plant Power's oat milk alternative still doesn't hold a candle to the real deal, but if your intolerance has you dying for the familiar taste of an ice cold shake, try the chocolate or strawberry varieties and pass on the Cookies and Cream.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great vegan fast food! We love going there when we want to splurge on less healthy food. We love the chicken sandwich, the holy guacamole burger, and the southwest avocado wrap. And of course we get fries too!</Text>

Finally got to try their breakfast menu! If you are plant based or trying to eat less meat and miss fast food breakfast sandwiches fret no more! So delicious and satisfying, the crispy hash browns really made it a complete meal and experience. Thank you for existing Plant Power, I had the best nostalgic meal!!

-Fries were 5/5. Not burnt or greasy.
-Vanilla Shake 5/5. not too thick or runny.
-Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with Ranch 5/5. It was the size of a double Whopper, plenty of sauce, juicy, and there wasn't more bread than meat.

A completely vegan meal all for 16$.
So good I forgot to take pics...< /Text>

I'm definitely a carnivore and love real beef. That being said, the rambler burger was fantastic. The "beef" tasted great, the bun was nice and soft. I'd give 5 stars but its a bit pricey. Great job Plant Power. Keep it up.< /text>

I came while on vacation, because we don't have PP where I'm from. My plan was to try several different restaurants while on my trip.

Well, plans ruined because the chicken sandwich was so good, it's literally all I've had since. I'm about to eat another one right now. I can't stop. Help!

Just kidding, I don't want help. No regrets.< /text>

Driving from LA and saw this place, stopped by and I'm sure glad we did !!! I had the Iconic Burger and my wife had the Chicken Sandwich with BBQ sauce and...... IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! We got a order of fries as well they were piping hot and crispy !!! I totally recommend this place and I'm stopping by when I head back to LA.

I'm not going to lie... I am not a vegan or a vegetarian, but on those meatless Mondays when i'm itching for a fastfood experience this is a great spot.  You can take your carnivore friends here and they'll 100% be satisfied.  Grab yourself a Rambler and thank me later.<//Review>

<text>Wow! Love it! I'm a former meat-eater, and the bacon cheeseburger was amazing! "Bacon" tasted like pork 😲
not crazy pricy, we (2 people) split a burger, fries, 8pc chicken nuggets, and got a soda for $16< /text></record>

<Review>Everything is truly vegan and doesn't taste vegan at all! Their vegan cheese melts! They have their own kombucha and soft serve vegan ice cream. And kombucha floats.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Delicious plant-based fast food with a lovely outdoor seating area. For vegans with nut allergies, this place is great because they barely use nuts (only in 4 dishes listed on their allergy card — ask staff), unlike a lot of other plant-based establishments.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMRewXiihIJw4xCE-b1i7Yru7e3fMNzKrRXJJA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr6xPIACg4OsigfhywaCpOMeIfJ8FoqWCpy7zQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<Name>Richard Castro< /Name><review>Not a bad place but the burgers are not worth 20 dollars for the quality. The bacon was a joke, it was like having dog treat strips on my burger, the paddies themselves where frozen and overcooked , I've had vegan burgers and this is not a good burger. Everything else I've had is good which is probably why this place has good ratings.</review>< pictures>

<rating>4</rating><text>Really good place for junk food vegan items. I love being able to order what I want from the menu without having to worry about it really being vegan. I will say, go through the drive-thru if you care about an hour of your time. If you order walk up or mobile order, you will watch basically 50 cars come and go before they get to your food (has happened the three times I've been here so it's a constant occurrence). Which, I mean I get, but it really shouldn't be like that. I worked for a few fast food places that had much more business and they didn't do that, even on severly short staffed days. I guess the assumption is if you've got the time to walk up, you got the time to wait. Not really the case though, some of us don't have cars and work closeby. Other than that, well you guys are doing good for the world. Thank you!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

If you drive near the Santa Fe Dr, Encinitas exit definitely worth checking it out!<//Review>< pics>

Always delicious and fresh. Definitely vegan, but not necessarily healthy, this place scratches the itch for comfort food when needed. The Rambler and the "bacon" "cheese" burger are favorites, and their fries are great! The shakes are also very good. Overall, this is a great go to if you are craving something "bad".</Review>

<Review>LOVE the veggie concept and the restaurant itself is cool in design but unfortunately my classic black bean burger was just okay. Didn't seem hand-formed (& for $7 it should be) and wasn't very flavorful, but it was hard to tell because there was way too much ketchup on it. My friend who got the Iconic burger with the soy patty enjoyed his though!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>Not a well run business. Owner should fire himself. The plant-based buffalo wings were terrible. They were so overly hot and spicy, like if you ordered at a normal wing place, they would be the Level 10 fire-alarm hottest ones offered. They are absolutely soaked in hot sauce. Why? Who knows why. Wouldn't offer mildly spicy buffalo wings make more sense. These ones gave me a canker sore.  And every other wing place restaurant gives u a side of celery slices or carrot slices with your order, to cool your mouth down. This vegan place offers nothing with theirs. I will not be back.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dc0c13e71980fb:0xe882bbf2d9437c5b</gmap_id><rate>1<//rate><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The vegan cheeseburger I had was great! Lots of lettuce that was a bright green, nice tomatoes, and lots of pickles, which made me very happy! I had enough for each bite. The sauces were plenty, and drippy, which worked for me! French fries are very thin, not greasy. I tried a bite of the animal fries and those were super yum!

Only sadness, the two things I wanted to try both had cilantro in them..the "beef" and the black bean. I believe that's correct, but check with them if you hate it as much as I do. Kind of a bummer, I couldn't get the avocado wrap or another very similar. Not their fault I HATE cilantro.

100% will go back. Staff was nice. No indoor seating so either sit outside on a nice little patio or eat in your car. They do have heaters.< /Text>

If I could do 4.5 stars I would. 4 isn't totally fair but 5 isn't true. Let my preface my review by saying I eat meat twice a day every day. That being said, the food was excellent. I can tell it isn't the real thing, but it's damn near it. Bravo to the vegan gods, they have outdone themselves on this one. The reason I dock a half point off is due to price (could be lower for fast-food), speed was a little slower than true fast food (but this food is harder to make good), and I could have done without the salad. Surprisingly they don't do that well and that alone almost out this at a true 4 star review. You go to a vegan place expecting a good salad and they should deliver.

After it is all said and done, I would come back to this place. It is assuredly better than any other true fast-food burger place baring In-N-Out, Five Guys, and Steak N Shake.<//text>

Delicious, healthy, organic, non-gmo, VEGAN, fast food.

Didn't even know this place existed and I'm so glad I do now!

Plant 🌱filled outdoor seating and plant 🌱 filled ingredients, this is a vegan paradise 🤤< /Review>

<Text>The Holy Guacamole was quite a delicious surprise. I've had other plant based burgers but this was full of flavor & just the right amount of aioli sauce & guacamole.  Fries were good; Not sure how they were prepared. I prefer mine crispy.  Love to see Plant Power Fast Food branch out back East.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Plant Power is thee place to go for vegan fastfood. It's practically indistinguishable from real fast food but in a good way. My vegan fiance and I go here all the time. Shakes are delicious too.<//Review>

<Review>Tasty vegan junk food! I had the southwest avocado wrap with fries at lunchtime and wasn't hungry for the rest of the day - it was so filling.

Hands down the best vegan fast food place. They have a different seasonal milkshake every month (my favorite part). They honestly never disappoint!!!!!!! It’s like a vegan in n out, but better ;). As a side note, I probably wouldn’t get any of their salads. They kind of just put romaine then top it off with vegan chicken, but everything else is great.
The wait can be much sometimes even if you’re the only one in line, but then again... I’m not impatient and I understand that this is a huge step for veganism. So even with the negatives here and there, it still doesn’t take away my 5 star rating.<//Text>

Almost "too real" Vegan fast food.

We tried:

The Buffalo ’66 Sandwich
Crispy battered buffalo ‘chicken’ breast, ‘ranch’ dressing, lettuce and tomato $7.95

'Fish' Filet Sandwich
Crispy breaded 'fish', American 'cheese', tartar sauce, lettuce and tomato $7.95

Kaleslaw
Creamy southern style slaw made with organic kale, carrots and cabbage $2.50

Fountain Drink
12oz. $2.00 / 16oz. $2.50 / 20oz. $2.95

Fair Trade Lemonade / Organic Black Tea / Natural Lemon Lime Soda / Natural Blueberry Soda / Natural Root Beer / Natural Cola

Everything was good and to be sure their food quality is better than any typical fast-food chain.  The faux fish was almost disturbingly "too real" in taste, texture, and aroma.   They really have nailed making a convincing flaked fish patty analog.   The chicken patty isn't quite as convincing but ous very good.  The slaw and soda were good.   We would go back again.  Bon Appétit. 😀</Text>

If you do end up going here, I recommend the crispy chicken sandwich! If you enjoyed delicious fast food style chicken sandwiches before going vegan, then you will love the plant power crispy chicken! It's amazing and taste delicious! Also, the shakes and voodoo fries are delightful! Would recommend, highly!< /Text>

This place is always really slow but 15 minutes for a salad is a new record of slowness for this place. It’s amazing food but please for the love of everyone wanting to get a quick vegan lunch speed things up. OB location never has these issues< /text>

The  Big Zac is an amazing and healthier alternative to....you know.
I think the iconic is an in n out.
The chicken sandwich is awesome.
It fooled one of my daughters friends.
Really good stuff.
Drinks are great.
Drive thru can take a while.
It’s sorta neat that the place used to be a gas station and now has nice plants and a dining area where people used to pump gas.
Don’t worry, no remnants left and it doesn’t smell.
Fun place to introduce people to vegan food (or don’t tell em)!< /review>

Calling PP "fast food" is a misnomer. Not as long as typical sit-down fare, but hardly quick. That's not a bad thing. This food is yummy, made so by the crispness on the protein and the freshness of the veggies and the great taste of the sauces. Worth waiting for. BTW, you don't have to be vege to enjoy</Review>

So delicious!! Totally vegan! Plenty of gluten free options! I highly recommend the beyond meat patty and ALL of the burgers! Their chicken sandwiches are delicious as well! Not in the mood for a meal (made when you add their awesome fries!)? Grab a "milkshake" or a slice of their better than cheesecake as a tasty treat! No matter what you choose- plant power will deliver both in taste AND service!< /review>

The fishless sandwhich and buffalo sandwich were awesome!  I asked for the fries well done and they were thin and crispy.  Whenever I get the desire for a blast from the past I go here.  My sister, who eats meat, said you can't tell they are not made from animal products.</review>

taste just like fish.  The fries are great and are a huge portion.  I was disappointed that they charge an extra $0.50 for a small portion of mayonnaise, considering the food is not cheap.  I hope they open one up in the Temecula/Murrieta area. My partner had the iconic Burger and she just loved it.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc0c13e71980fb:0xe882bbf2d9437c5b< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great food and service with a smile!....go plant power!...glad you folks are catering to the vegetarian market in a fast food format.

Love the ambience and setup!...and above all recyclable nature of all the utensils.

Would be great if the pricing were ratcheted a little lower as this kind of food should be more mainstream!<//text>< pics>

I love this place. Every breakfast item is excellent. I'm not a fan of the burgers, both black bean and beef are kind of meh, but the chicken is great. Try the shakes. Peanut butter flavor is amazing and every monthly flavor has been great.< /Text>

Really delicious food, served quickly and efficiently. There’s a nice eating area outside, an altogether delightful lunch experience. It’s a great place to go when you’re visiting somebody at Scripps Encinitas hospital across the street, too!</review>

Vegan Bacon cheese burger was the best tasting vegetarian burger I ever had (and I have had dozens of different ones). Fries were great too! Outside seating area needs more frequent bussing/cleaning. Great location. My nephew is super picky eater and loved the chicken nuggets so much he made me drive 45 minutes to take him back a few days later.</text>

It is great to see a Vegan restaurant. We need more of them. Burgers are great. Wish they would bring the mini corn dogs back and step up their game a little. Food takes too long. Not fast enough to be called fast food. They need to display the kids menu better on the drive thru menu board.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>The food is good and they are pretty decent about getting it out fast and all at once (if you order food for more than one person). I don't know what it is with San Diego and restaurants giving people's meals all at different times so one person might finish first because they got their main dish ten minutes before everyone else. Not this place! They serve it all at once and it's all still hot. Sorry, but I really enjoy eating my food while everyone else eats so having your food all at once in a big group of people is very nice. This place gets it all done at once.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I recommend their breakfast menu. I couldn't believe their egg was plant based. The egg even has a yolk! Their `iconic fries` tastes like in-n-out counterpart.
They have wifi, power outlets, and high speed internet. So you don't have to leave that fast :)</Review>

I used to love this place and referred so many people over the years. Today when I went in they had "consolidated" their menu. One of my favorites... burger with swiss cheese and mushroom, no longer offered. I brought a friend with me today for lunch. Neither one of us had a food meal. We liked the root beer and french fries. Unless the quality of food reverts to what is was in the beginning I doubt I will return. Very sad!< /text>

Plant based fast food that doesn't break the bank and tastes good.  So nice to be able to walk in and order without the concern of can I eat it?  Please open one in the Central Coast.<//Text>

<Text>First off I am not Began or even vegetarian for that matter but my cousin is and we went here for lunch one day.

I had a burger and fries and it was one of the best burgers (beef or otherwise) I have ever had. I have had plenty of veggie burgers and some are pretty good but thus one was amazing.< /Text>< Pictures>

Favorite fast food place ever. The Big Zac is better than any other non-vegan fast food burger I've ever had except maybe In n Out. I'm not even a vegetarian or a vegan and this is my go to fast food place. Employees are friendly, the prices are maybe a little more than average fast food place but nothing crazy. Service is pretty quick and I've had them screw up an order. All the sauces are tasty and the onion rings are bomb.</Text>

< Review>
Great concept for a vegan-friendly fast food restaurant, and with something for everyone -- even carnivores will find something great on this menu. Bring one to my town, please! My only complaint stems from the fact that we were there on a day when they were slammed, so it took almost 30 minutes to get our food. They simply were ill-prepared for the number of customers they had that day -- they need to figure that out.<//Review>

<review>Decent food. Really slow drive thru. The peanut butter shake is delicious! The fake bacon is really gross, along with the sausage. Chicken nuggets and the burger are good, and the service is always great. A bit expensive for decent food. Besides the shakes, nothing I've tried is delicious, and I'm vegan.< /review><GmapID>0x80dc0c13e71980fb:0xe882bbf2d9437c5b<//GmapID>< user_id>

Quick, easy, close to Scripps Medical Center & Hospital.  Very tasty, healthy.  What more can one ask for?  I recommend if you're looking for the above.  Have fun!</text>

<Text>Wow! The bomb. My beautiful girlfriend talked me into being a vegan for the month of February and I was craving a burger. We ordered a burger and fries that were over the top. Very reasonable prices. The fries are 10 TEN STAR! We want a franchise in San Clemente, California.</Text>< pics>

I had a southwestern wrap - flavor quite good overall, a little on the salty side.

Drive thru was a little slow but for the quality of food it’s what I expected.

Only reason I give it four stars is because it isn’t super budget friendly. If it really is meant to be a healthy fast food joint they gotta take those prices down - I wish a company out there would make budget healthy food on the go it would be great for a lot of people.</Review>

Truly the future of fast food. I loved being able to eat a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich for breakfast everyday while I was on vacation in Encinitas. The staff was friendly, they give you so many different ways to order, and they enable vegans to eat fast food like chicken tenders with milkshakes from a drive thru! I cannot wait for you to expand and takeover the world, hopefully.< /Text><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Yum! Always love stopping here for some plant-based deliciousness while traveling near Encinitas. The employees are always polite, and the outdoor seating area is covered in flowers that attract local pollinators (save the bees!), which is lovely whether you are just waiting on your food, or opt for a sit-down meal.
Expect a slight wait, but that's only because they make your food to order. Can't get enough of this place!<//Review>

As a vegan, this place was awesome to visit. Love the airiness and softness in the buns of the classic burger and the chocolate shake tasted like a regular milkshake but without the dairy. Highly recommend this place if you’re vegan or not!<//Review>

<text>First time visiting and loooved that Plant Power turned an old gas station into an outdoor dinning area! Its really cute. Cool self order touch screens, fast service and delicious  burgers! Ordered the Holy Guacamole with a black bean patty, added "bacon" and had it wrapped in cabbage. It was delicious! They offer to make your burger into a burrito as well, which I think is neat. Friend ordered the buffalo "chicken sandwich and that was just as fire! Pina Colada vegan shake gets a thumbs up as well 👍🏼<//text>< gmap_id>

I wish you had healthier options...  just because something is vegan doesn't mean its healthy... processed soy and gluten and deep fried galore. Not a fan, but glad they're trying to offer an alternative< /text>

Delicious plant-based fast food. I had the guacamole burger and a chocolate and coffee milkshake. The burger came with a "special" sauce of sorts that I would have left off had I known. I just don't care for mayonnaise sauces and the guac and jalapeno would have been more than to keep it from being dry. The shake was excellent! It was $15 for the two items so you do pay for compassion, but it's not every day we get Vegan fast food!!</Text>

Great food. I had the Big Zac and if was really good with a tasty sauce for it. The sweet potato medallions were thin and taste great, but next time I would probably get a thicker fry because I like the thicker texture.

The best part was looking at the menu, and being able to order anything on the menu and it's all vegan.</Review>

My 10-year old rated the "wake & bacon" the best burger he's ever had. The veggies, (especially the tomatoes) were super fresh and my "buffalo 66" chicken sandwich was tasty too. Staff is also really friendly.<//Text>

I love this place. It's fast, affordable, and has the best tasting vegan fast food and milkshakes. The Big Zac is my go to choice, and the horchata milkshake is the best milkshake I've ever had. Definitely try this place if you're in the area.< /text>

< Review>
Breakfast is the only time to come. The burgers are overpriced for what you get. What you get is vegan food eons behind what you can buy in a store. Not a quarter as good as a beyond burger. The rambling burger was so dry and the Zac was mediocre as well. For 2 dollars more you can get a to die for impossible burger somewhere else. The buffalo wings are beyond soggy and like drinking a gallon of oil. The chili cheese fries are maybe the only 'lunch time' saving grace.  The chicken and waffles are great for a breakfast item. But super sad about the burgers.</Review>

chicken tenders with ranch = amazing
iconic burger = amazing
ginger kombucha = amazing

room for improvement: very little parking, the food took a while to make, no bathroom, only outdoor seating, location not ideal/loud since only outdoor seating.</review>

Great plant-based food. My favorite was the Buffalo 'chicken' sandwich. Try their old-fashioned milkshakes too with almond milk. I had the chocolate peanut butter which was so good!<//Review>

<text>I go here about 3 times a week and love it! All the burgers are consistently good and the horchata shake is the bomb!

Edit: i gave it 5 stars initially, but service has degraded considerably over the past few weeks. Today, they forgot my fries which I only realized after getting home. Ketchup and/or utensils (if I'm getting the kaleslaw for eg.) are not always provided. Used to be a great place, not so much anymore.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

By far my favorite (vegan) place I have ever been too. And I LOVE (vegan) food. As a vegan it is so awesome to have a vegan fast food place with chili cheese fries, milkshakes that are incredible, burgers that melt in your mouth and yummy soda. Not to mention their breakfast is delicious. The waffle jammer tastes like a cinnamon roll waffle. It's awesome. If I could eat this everyday I would! Haha! You won't be disappointed with anything you get.</Review>

Awesome chili cheese fries, fabulous breakfast egg sandwiches (with the fried egg!) and fantastic crispy chick’n sandwiches! Love Plant Power Fast Food!!!! The only thing I don’t like is how far it is from my house! Whenever I drive from Orange County to San Diego, I always stop at PPFF!</text>

Ive been here twice now and i love it. The aesthetic is great with a cool garden seating area in front of the restaurant. They also have a drive through! Service is friendly and fast.
Favorites so far: voodoo fries, peanut butter milkshake and the bacon burger. Next time i drive by i'm going to get the big zac.< /text>

Great place to visit for vegan fast food! I am attempting to try everything on Plant Power’s menu and have yet to find an item I did not find to be delicious! I need to try their shakes then report back!< /text>

So amazing to have vegan fast food. So yummy but very pricey. A "combo" meal is easily $11+<//text>

While the food is very good the amount of time it takes to go through the drive thru is unbearable. Waited in line 30 minutes today, usually it's about 20 which is just plain awful.< /review>

It’s everything you’d want in a fast food joint. They have fries, burgers, shakes. Fried foods etc. But it is fast food so.…don’t expect fine dining and you’ll be happy.</text>

Very expensive for fast food, but everything was delicious. All of their packaging is made from compostable materials, so you just dump your trash into the compost as you leave. The have a lovely garden full of edible plants outside.<//Text>

Pricey and just ok.  Bread isn’t whole grain and food is just ok for the price.  Not really health food, just better than the alternatives. Wanted to like it...< /Review>

I always wanted to try this place, finally went through there drive thru. It is a great place, the people were really nice when I asked about GF options and didn't rush us when giving us the food, but wished is well very peacefully and genuinely. It really feels like fast food for and by Yogi's, hehe 😄. I got the delicious kale quinoa salad with avocado/chili dressing, so so good (even my 3yr old niece loved it). The best was there elderberry kombucha float, made with almond milk ice cream, AMAZING!! It's a seasonal flavor, so I'll have to go back soon!<//Review>

Been vegan for about two months, and when I tried this place I honestly freaked out. I couldn’t believe that “bacon cheeseburger” and “chicken tenders” were vegan. Absolutely delicious, will visit again!< /review>

<review>Amazing food, SO delicious but the customer service was really bad. We felt rushed and then wanted to change our order a little, they refused (even the manager) and offered no added bonus or anything to compensate for how rude they were or as a customer appreciation or any customer service. They looked at us like it was the worst thing they've ever seen that we wanted to modify our order...that happens all the time people. Don't serve others if you're not willing to be accommodating. I hate writing anything negative but this was a huge issue for a simple request.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc0c13e71980fb:0xe882bbf2d9437c5b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Not sure if it's just this location.... but Plant Power doesn't seem as good in quality since they first opened in OB. Plus, it's expensive. I'll give it 2 stars simply because it's all vegan lol<//Review>

SLOWEST “fast food” place i have ever been to. Decent food. There are better tasting vegan options and faster vegan options. But if you still want to feed your inner “fast food” craving while vegan this is kind of your only option. The place looks like someone didnt finish the building in spots. There is no inside seating. Few parking spots.

Did i mention it takes about 30 MINS to get through the drive thru at this “fast food” place?!< /review>

Very friendly, consumer oriented. Holy Guacamole burger was top notch. Whole leaf lettuce, bright red tomato, that seemed  to be vine ripened ....Mmmmmm. mini corn dogs were delish , sweet potato fries were chip style, great !

It's pretty good. The burger bun sucks. As confirmed by myself and others around. It is dry and flavorless, so dry it sucked up the minimal amount of bbq sauce on my bbq burger. There should never be a higher volume of bun than burger and toppings. We have evolved past this cardboard brown bread, let's keep up with the times.

I ordered the green juice, it tastes like someone threw some spinach and herbs in green tea, it's not even green. Not the nutritional boost I was looking for. Obviously much better than a soda - but could be greatly improved.

It's strange that counter service dine in gives every customer to go bags. Take example from in n out or any other drive in/dine in style fast food and give the customer the choice of needing a bag or eating at the beautiful tables provided.

All in all the flavor is great and has a variety of options. The milkshake is super yummy and I am happy to see it across from a hospital.

Would recommend for a fast food alternative, but definitely there are a few very noticeable things to work on.

Lastly- if everything is compostable, why are there only trashcans available?</Review>

Usually my time spent here is pleasureable, but today I had the worst service, I was not able to refund the food that I had because it left the door yet, serveal things were forgotten and I did not go far from the pickup area,  I literally sat in there outside seating section so it literally took 3 mins for me to realize this is not what I wanted.... I was very disappointed, and will not spend money here and will encourage many not to do the same..< /text>

Would have 5 stars if the prices allowed for EVERYONE to eat there. Very expensive. Almost.....greedy corporate expensive?<//Text>

<Review>I had a great first experience here. Friendly staff, great chicken sandwich (sooo tasty), and the Horchata milkshake was delicious. Food is pricy but high quality. I'll come back again. P.S. I am not vegan.< /Review>< pictures>

I had a really bad case of food posioning.  I called them to notify and they suggested i may be allerigic to soy.  Maybe .  Like the idea of vegan fast food,  it just didnt like me.</Review>

< review>
I was super stoked to try this place. We ordered the buffalo 'chicken' sandwich, 'chicken' tenders, and voo doo fries. All was delish... Although, I thought I was just ordering regular fries. They were smothered in a few sauces and grilled onions. Not a fan but others might be! Try it! We'll be back for sure!</review>

<Review>I want to start off by saying that I'm super stoked they are there. I get they are in there soft phase but I think there is a lack of team work or management. Bad way to start off. Went theu drive thru and girl had already kindly gifted herself a 30% tip. So watch your total!!!! I caught it and made her refund. Food is pretty good. I ageee the buns are hard from other review. Also geez they put like a gallon of mustard on it. Went back for 2 milkshakes today and waited 20 min to see they were sitting in there and no one bothered to call my numbe. Asked the girl to hand them to me and she told me I needed to wait till she was done with her customer in line. Seriously. I had to practically crawl 1/2 thru the window to grab them myself. Melted by now and one had the lid 1/2 off and leaked all over me. Also witnessed 1 employee to step in and help with the 2nd line and then decided she was done and just abandoned her line of people. Everyone was trying to merge back in  1st line. Total mess. A manager needs to be micro managing and delegating more till they figure this all out. But hopefully they will bc I love the concept.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Good quick vegan/vegetarian food, price is alright the biggest downside is there's no nutritional information for any of their food.<//Text>
