Always our favorite pumpkin patch to hang out at and the kids love the petting zoo. Ticket books are $20 for 20 tickets. So its a pretty good deal.<//Text>

They have a petting area for some of their goats and other small animals. They have small attractions for kids as well. You can beat this location, and when your done having fun and choosing your pumpkin, the adults can go enjoy some music, wine, and beer...shoot you can drink your wine and beer while looking for your pumpkin. Enjoy, you can never go wrong coming here.<//text>< user>

We experienced a perfect night for punkin' huntin'🎃this crisp, late October evening with loved ones, pumpkins🎃 laughter, and memories under a canopy of stars and near full moon.  I know, it sounds corny because it is.  This was my first experience here and I had no complaints.  I highly recommend for the littles as they have a petting zoo, pony rides, plenty of photo ops and of course the Pumpkins!  Had a great time here 5 stars. 🤩< /review>

<Text>It’s a small pumpkin patch but lovely! Our 4 yr old and 2 yr old ran around freely. They have goats and baby goats!! Kids are free to pet them. They have horse rides and go karts. Food trucks. A train. We did spend a good amount of money to do it all but it was worth it. You can also not buy drinks in there and spend a lot less.< /Text>< pics>

Family friendly and wonderful! For everyone saying "not many people wearing MASKS, and this is a pandemic people", be quiet. If you're so scared, stay home. Also, if you're wearing your mask and practicing social distancing, why do you care what other people are doing???? Honestly? Why? You do you. Great job Peltzer!<//text>

Nothing easy about managing any business through these crazy, uncertain times. I personally am grateful to have a place like Peltzer Winery and the Pumpkin Patch who are doing an amazing job navigating through the craziness so we have something to look forward to. During the week when it's less busy I like to go and relax with a glass of wine (that Meritage is sooooo good). I also think it's super cool that they've spent the time to spread all the seating areas out and coordinate activities on the farm that support social distancing. Some people struggle with the mask requirement and I imagine it's difficult to make us all happy and comfortable but all in all, I think the Peltzer family and team are doing an amazing job. Grateful for y'all!!!!< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Went on a Tuesday afternoon. As someone mentioned before, I was overwhelmed with the amount of people not wearing masks (including the staff members at the ticket booths). They didn't limit the number of people in the petting zoo and it had long lines for the pony rides (with no real social distancing). We were trying to do a traditional fall activity in this crazy time but it is sad that they would not enforce or follow the healthcare recommendations. We spent out time instead taking a few pictures but left soon after.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>My family and I were very skeptical to attend a pumpkin patch due to the pandemic with COVID and this facility despite how nice everything was...there were NO precautions or restrictions on Mask wearing or keeping socially distant!!! Many people were there close to the pumpkin patch by the kids drunk and cussing as well pretending to cough and sneeze!!!
Lines were super long for food and the train ride. My kids wanted to ride the ponies which we waited an HOUR in the line!
My kids had fun but us adults and older siblings did not! Only reason kids had fun was because of the ponies and lil tractor rides which they enjoyed more waiting in the line playing on the hay stacks 🤦‍♀️🤣</Review><Gmap_id>0x80db792ea4b19fa5:0x6becfbf22b29e8e6</Gmap_id></record>

It was very discouraging to see so many people swarming around and standing in line without  masks. This place will nickel and dime you- You'll pay just to get in and then pay extra for pumpkins and any activities.  Unused tickets cannot be spent towards pumpkins or the wine.  Stick to Omas.   The wine was nice though.</text>

The venue has potential to be a great family experience but I was shocked to find a complete lack of COVID safety rules - no required social distancing; no crowd control; very few people wearing masks. Come on people—- There’s a PANDEMIC!< /Text>

I’ve always loved going to Peltzer farms as I’ve been going for years and years, when I went on the website to see what the Covid rules were I was very pleased that masks were required. I am so sad to say when we arrived I’d say only a handful were wearing masks none of the staff were wearing masks and I was so disappointed it looked like a super spreader Event to me!
I thought being a private farm that the rules would be enforced as far as social distancing the amount of people allowed in and having masks mandatory. We wear masks  at the store,  we were masks at Target and Walmart,  we wear masks in public areas! What In the world is happening to Temecula? I thought Temeculans were responsible!! Temecula shame on you! And You all complain that our restaurants And businesses keep opening  and closing this is exactly why...!!!< /Review>

Website claims that there will be a limited number of people allowed in, masks will be worn by employees and that there would be hand washing stations. None of those things were true, except for one hand washing station. Over crowded and a majority of people not wearing masks, including employees. Zero precautions taken in the middle of a pandemic and shortly after our county being further restricted due to rising positive cases.</review>

This was our first outing since the Covid-19 closures in March...we decided to go here as they posted that safe practices were being instituted (e.g. masks, safe distancing, etc..) however what we found when we got there was that masks were optional and hardly anyone was adhering to the safe distancing guidelines, they did have hand washing stations and hand sanitizer, especially near the petting zoo, but for us that was not nearly enough to make us feel comfortable,  so after purchasing $20 in tickets for the attractions and only allowing my 3 year old daughter to ride the ponies once as that was the main reason we went, we left. We were HIGHLY disappointed in both the misleading advertising on the website and the careless attitude of the staff during these troubling times, and will probably never go to this establishment ever again...would strongly recommend no one else attend either, at least until the pandemic is over. It will not surprise me to find out later that this place caused another large outbreak of the Corona Virus in Temecula.<//text>

Even with the website stating that masks are mandatory, about 75% of people there weren’t wearing masks and weren’t social distancing. We talked to the staff at the entrance and they said they aren’t extending the staff to enforce policy. There was one hand washing station outside of the petting zoo but no hand sanitizer stations. How many hands have been all over those pumpkins. This is a superspreader hot spot. Bring your hand sanitizer and wear a mask bc no one else is.< /text>

<Text>Surprised they charge $2 each admission! If you are going for pictures of your babies or whatnot, you can find just as good at a free admission pumpkin patch... 2 out of the 3 "giant" pumpkins my kids picked were rotten when we tried to pick them up. Pony ride was definitely worth it but otherwise will stick to the Murrieta pumpkin patch...< /Text></record></dataset><record>

So sad! They are extremely overpriced, and had no more than 40 pumpkins to choose from. Will not go back and do not recommend. Went last year also, and it was so so. Went back since it’s local, and will not go again.</text>

<Date>1538948900050<//Date><rating>2</rating><Text>The place is nice but beware. It’s pricey for what you get. Pricing is super misleading. The signage is written to confuse the hell out of people. Multiple people had problems with their “under 2” signage. Another sign said 2 years are free.
Why don’t they just put kids up to one years of age are free instead of “under 2”
When I told them about it that a lot of people are confused by their signs and statements they were rude and disrespectful about me just telling them that it confuses customers.  I’ve never had business owners argue when you  are just telling them a suggestion. Instead of apologizing. When people are coming here
throwing down $40 bucks just to enter and go to two attractions show some appreciation to your customer. The best part is the pony rides and they are the nicest people here.
Skip this place take the nice drive to Bates nut farm, they are thankful for their customers and happy to serve you. Last time I’ll bring my family here. Been coming here for last 4 years. Sorry we are done. Disrespectful crew.< /Text>< pictures>

Love this place and for north county residents this kicks Bates butt IMHO. Only reason they get four stars is because the ONLY restrooms are port a potties.  Petting zoo, pony rides, pumpkins, gem mining, pig races and training ride and it is all st a beautiful country farmhouse chic winery.  No food on hand but they often have a food truck. Gets crowded on the weekends! The only free things are the pig races FYI<//text>

Been coming for several years. Don't know if we'll be back next year.<//Text>< GmapID>

Very helpful and friendly staff, a nice variety of farm animals, lots of pumpkins, and most importantly the kids loved it.  A most wholesome enjoyable way to enjoy this autumn season in an afternoon without breaking your bank.  The kids can't wait to visit again.<//Review>

<Text>We took our 2 year old and newborn here for the pumpkin patch. It's very cute and perfect for toddlers. It's very clean, friendly, and reasonably priced. My advice is just to purchase a ticket package upfront. I had to keep going back to get more tickets because I didn't expect there to be so many attractions. Also dress according. It was ten degrees warmer there than in San Diego and I had my kids in long sleeves. It was uncomfortable for them, but they still had fun. We will probably be back next year.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><user>110352356981607804436</user><gmapID>0x80db792ea4b19fa5:0x6becfbf22b29e8e6<//gmapID><Name>Victoria Swift<//Name><Response>None</Response><Rate>4< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Name>KaleidoscopeEyes< /Name><date>1542147951641< /date><Rate>1</Rate><text>I suppose I've been spoiled by Midwestern pumpkin patches with beautiful displays of Fall decor, great selections of activities, games & rides to keep the kiddos entertained, yummy food: apple cider donuts, homemade fudge, cider, apples and other yummy treats, souvenir/home decor shopping, haunted houses, huge corn mazes, live music... Instead we got to stand in line for 30 minutes just to receive expensive wristbands that were only good for admission to walk around hay bales, pose with wooden cutouts, and play grade school level "fun fair" games without prizes that you must first purchase tickets for and outrageously priced pumpkins. They do have horse rides, a small maze and a restaurant that we didn't bother going into because the line was ridiculously long. It was a HUGE disappointment. Sorry... we had high expectations.<//text>< pics>

I don't often write a review on Google unless I really LOVE something.  I LOVE PELTZER FARMS!  My kids and I have been visiting for the last 8 years as part of our family tradition.  The kids know as soon as October is here we are going to Peltzer Farms to get our pumpkins and watch the pig races.  It is a real farm, run by an amazingly generous and community minded family.  Worth our trip from San Diego each year!</Review>

<text>Brought our Grandson here last year and had a great time. Very disappointing this year. Rotting pumpkins and trash everywhere. Train rides and pony rides are only after 3pm weekdays. Website  advertised pony rides and train rides without time restrictions. I do not recommend this place if you are looking for a good pumpkin patch to take the kids.< /text>< pics>

For being the newest winery in temecula valley these folks have more potential than most. Very personable staff, warm and welcoming atmosphere, and exicelent wine!

If they keep it up they will easily become one of the top wineries in California.</Text>

I've read and heard many ask: What happened to Peltzer Farm - used to be so awesome?!  I'll answer that question this way: what happened to the farm is essentially the same thing that has happened to temecula overall: infiltration from coastal California including oc, sd and even la.  They have brought with them the very culture many of us originally came to temecula to escape.  It's past time to move on,  temecula has devolved to a point beyond recognition.< /Text>

After going to an event here last year we were excited to bring the kids this year to the pumpkin patch. We were disappointed with the entry fee, the prices of the activities ($5 pony ride per child,etc.) and the lack of food and music. It just seemed like a high cost for a lackluster experience for the kids.</text>

I went to Peltzer Farms today at 10:00 a.m. The gates were open so I parked, got the stroller out of car, changed diaper, etc. as this all takes 10-15 minutes.  There were 7 people standing around not far from me.  I asked who worked here, because I hadn't been there before.  A man looked a me and said we are closed for the season, I said would it be okay for us to look at the animals?  The man gave me a hand gesture waving me on and said NO we are closed for the season.  I asked then why is there no sign at the gate?  He gave another hand gesture to move on.  This irritated me because they were not friendly at all, and all I wanted to do was show my granddaughter the animals for a few minutes, what harm would that have caused?  I will never go there again.  There was no reason to be not friendly.< /Review>

Such a fun place! So much history to review. And you can feel the energy as soon as you walk in. A stunning upgrade to a place that created so many memories, including the last year's worth!! The food is delicious, the service is spot on! The drinks served cold with a warm smile!<//review>

Surprisingly affordable because you can have an entree with several sides below $10. This place seems to be a late arrival in the Hawaiian BBQ craze of yesteryear, but to be fair, it doesn't come off as trying to sell you Hawaiian dishes as a novelty. Try the dishes because they are visually enticing, affordably priced, and refreshingly different at least as far as the food offerings on this strip by the subway is concerned.<//Review>

Chicken Katsu mix was perfect.
Cashier told me their best flavor for Hawaiian sun was guava but i dunno. Their portions are huge and that makes me very happy</text>

<Text>Had a bad experience I went Wednesday night 20 minutes before closing they took my order I waited half an hour for my order for them to tell me that they gave away my food and the kitchen close that they can’t replace my order. Who close kitchen before taking out orders.

This is a great place to pick up Hawaiian BBQ. The interior is very well done and comfortable. I ordered the three meat combination plate and it was excellent. I prefer their food over L&L BBQ. Will definitely go back again.</text>

<text>Sorry but this is not a 5 star location. Food was so-so. Pulled pork was flavorless. The beef had a hint of flavor but obviously has been sitting. Salad needed to be tossed in the dressing. NOT drizzle a little on it. None of the meats came off the grill lightly dressed with sauce, as they should be. With the $15?...NOPE.....Still cannot get rid of the weird after taste in the rice of beef that is not quit right........<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

This place has everything you could want from a Hawaiian BBQ, first and foremost, macaroni salad (good Lord this is yummy), rice, Katzu (I think that's how u spell it) chicken (breaded chicken), short ribs, rice, steamed veggies, Hawaiian sodas and regular fountain drinks. You can have a mini lunch box (yummy, but don't expect leftovers), one meat, two meat , three it's all up to how hungry you are.
Highly recommend it, will visit again.
Only issue is that it's near the metro station, so parking is real hard to find</text>

The real deal BBQ on the west coast!  We are from the south but live in California and good southern BBQ is hard to find.  The food is delicious & the staff friendly. The pork was my favorite!  My husband is from Los Angeles & loved their SC BBQ sauce. Thanks for the sauce, Tom!  A must when in Los Angeles,!</Review>

<text>Love this place. It pays to stand in line before they open. One time, after the first person went in, they bought out the afternoon supply, and got a rain-check for 4pm.

Everything is great here. If it's not too cold out, use the tables on the hill, if you can't wait to dig in.< /text>< Pictures>

Hawaii Ono has the best value of just about any lunch/dinner restaurant. A lot of delicious protein; beef, chicken, fish, shrimp...combined with rice, veggies, and the always guilty macaroni salad. Delicious! Going back today.< /Review>

<text>Very GOOD!! Chicken was perfectly cooked to a golden brown and the texture was great. Inside juicy and outside crispy to the bite. Awesome!! We also had Spam musubi's and a bbq chicken musubi. Which were super good!! Rice to meat ratio was on point and everything was very tasty.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkcVrSRE8D-IirNSb2TwkyEohUzPYAG7XMOrs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

This is the best place to me in the world for food. Very clean and friendly environment. Never ever had a problem with my food and they cook your food as it is ordered. Oh and the amount of food you get is enough for 2 meals.< /review>

Absolutely amazing place one of my favorite and only fast food joints that I will eat! Their fish is so tasy and the macaroni salad is amazing! Also love the steamed vegetables that come with the plate. Ordering the big plate equals two meals worth of food</Review>

One of my best lunch places to visit for a fast food joint! The meat is always sweet and savory and the veggies are streamed to perfection. Who can ask for more when you have their Mac Salad? Their Macaroni Salad is FIRE. You get a lot of food for the price you pay with unlimited refills and kick butt dipping sauces! You can't beat that. Recently we tried a different location and received the same results so it's consistent! We love the music, too - very relaxing. We will definitely be back for more.<//text>

Crazy delicious. Ordered the ribs + brisket + corn bread + greens via grubhub.

Here in 30 mins, food piping hot. Honestly some of the best ribs I've ever had. Molten deliciousness. Brisket was pretty good too. Who knew CA had good bbq.<//Text>

Delicious food, great rice, and only a short walk from the North Hollywood Metro Station. I usually go for the sampler plate since its a great combo to have chicken and beef on the same plate.

My only issue I ran into was the teriyaki sauce was aalmost completely out and I was unable to fill the little sauce cup.

Other than that the food was great and also not too busy while I was waiting<//Text>

Ever since I've been introduced to this I've been in love 😍 I personally haven't taken a trip to Hawaii but I must say.......I LOVE THEIR FOOD!!!👍 If you're an omnivore (like me)...Lol you'll like this! "Note" it's not "budget friendly" well to me anyways 😄 but whenever I'm in the mood for some Hawaiian style BBQ this is THE BEST PLACE TO EAT!!<//review>

Hawaiian chicken is their best menu plate.  $10.  Decent portions.  No ambiance in the dining room but the food is great.  Tender and flavorful chicken.</text>

Now this was my first visit, so keep that in mind. The food was just okay. I definitely won't rave about it and probably won't ever crave it. I would much rather spend my $12 at Chipotle or Fatburger.< /Review>

Their teriyaki is amazing. Juicy and perfectly marinated. I could eat this everyday.

However thier chicken katsu was way too overcooked. It was so overcooked, i felt like i was chewing chips, i couldnt taste the chicken.< /review>

Okay... I'm having a bit of a hard time trying to figure out how to explain  how I feel about this place. I've been to two of these locations. The first one was how I expected it to be. Not great,  but also not completely terrible.  I went to this location, after I got done eating ( I despise wasting food) I knew I was never going to come back to any of these places  on my own merits. I ordered a chicken cutlet. Its such a simple thing.  I don't know what on earth happened but it tasted and felt like they forgot about it in the fryer but still decided to serve it to me anyway. This combined with a pile of overcooked, mushy rice, and a laughably tiny glob of macaroni salad, for the price I paid for it, was almost insulting.  I spent the whole meal just washing it down with my beverage.  At least the woman at the counter was nice? She did her job well. That should be acknowledged. I was not displeased with the service. Just the food they served.   I hope they adopt some better quality control in the future because that was a real shame.<//text>

<review>Worst customer service ever. I love the food here but every time I come into this store the front counter workers ignore me. They never greet me or ask me if I’m ready to order. After standing at the front counter waiting to place my order for a couple of minutes I finally just walked out. Please hire a better staff!!!!! Horrible</review>< gmap_id>

Good fish. There choice of sides is cheap (white rice & cabbage) for the price. One can only eat so much cabbage whether boiled or made into cole slaw!  The sauces for the chicken was delicious!  The free-standing beverage machine, when eating in, was nice.  The chicken was tastey, only when eaten immediately and while hot.</review>

The only reason it's not 5 stars is the parking situation. The lot in back can be expensive and street parking is pretty full.<//review>

<review>Food was a little off at the North Hollywood location. Veggies undercooked, chicken we received was not freshly cooked. Very hard and the Katsu was hard as well. That tasted like it was microwaved. I like Ono but very disappointed.<//review>< gmapID>

These guys made my meat splurge day worth it! I typically try to stick to a vegetarian diet, but about once every 4-6 weeks I indulge in meat, so I try to make it worth it! I didn't know about this place at first because it seemed kind of fast-foody and usually when I treat myself to meat I like to do it in a fancy shmancy kind of place :-)  But I was with a friend and she really wanted to eat here so I gave it a shot.  I had the chicken katsu (YUM) and the island white fish (SUPER YUM)! I recommend it!!</Review>

<text>I might be just saying this because Hawaiian food is awesome....but thia place if good...i suggest the different BBQ combo it is good for two people....i tried the spam musubi i would recommend, but prefer cold rather than warm so just let it chill in your fridge for a bit or let it cool to room temp then eat....< /text>< Gmap_id>

Cheap Hawaiian food indistinguishable from it's competition. Vegetables are never good. Chicken is sometimes stringy. The staff is friendly, but the cashiers are also the baggers and they prep the food, so you might have to wait just to order. However, I've always gotten my food within ten minutes. On most days there's a man that asks you for a quarter outside next to the timed meters. Bathrooms are clean.</Text>

This location just plain sucks. First they under portion second this is what you get for a $4 add on. If you want the real deal, go to San Pedro. They will do you right.<//Review>

Tried the chicken and beef BBQ, also got the musubi. $5 for two pieces of musubi when they don't even give you a full slice of spam is robbery. The BBQ made me sick, I ate it and soon after I was dry heaving and feeling nauseous. Won't be going there again.<//review>

<Date>1578784648250<//Date><Rate>4</Rate><review>(Translated by Google) Ono family meal I ate, but the amount is huge. Fire chicken literally tastes like chicken and the teriyaki beef is familiar. It seems to suit Korean tastes. Instead, the sauce is so sweet and salty that it's hard to eat twice.

(Original)
Ono family meal 먹었는데 역시나 양이 어마어마하게 많아서 절반가까이 남김. Fire chicken은 말그대로 불닭맛 나고 데리야키 소고기도 친숙한 맛. 한국인들 입맛에 잘 맞을듯. 대신 소스가 너무 달고 짜서 두번 먹기는 좀 힘듬.<//review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I ate here because it was delicious to go to Chipotle. There was a response to eat with one whole piece of meat.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Great private club.  Pretty exclusive but if you can get on with someone,  you won't be disappointed.  Excellent greens and fairways.  Challenging and fair layout but not a cupcake course.  Plenty of elevation changes and side hill lies.  Rough is fairly penal, but not impossible.  Nice range area. Beautiful clubhouse and the most impressive parking structure I've seen.  Deserves a 6 star rating.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPERBAI75UUsh95078XZdAhzU4wf5MRcJI_4AuY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhBAiLoHoTDK686gdG6Yvr3HRkgh__iuSCxsAB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNix0v5mlf_nvl5D6SlcfWkQqN7jua5pSjy7E5S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoe0P_ubP4vyGlHCokP2wQC5lbi2MTU_c5m2FX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi8Hj_t2iXcnvJ4xmJ79-iXgXyzSyeZwdwvzp4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOskqJLGs6H9IhVlC1AemdrJE-7QjyTUikc6oI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzzs7GXiFhXUFvcpR97z6zZf5_2Q-01E8xpFF4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkHu8DndvXI2_wSVBbOh3TNyz8ASA-wFQnSvVn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMilo0c4fwJhG557BoZy_8RJzIYjoyt7UBbn1i2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOt0vVSHXqIb71sLBw5_5q2GMJyCPBGQey6rj2h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVWHihGr9ZOV-kcd_n6ZvVKqMUwGIcHCVl7EQh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBY5mVjttt7IBLaDZMZxrfwZ8pZ43GRXUT8lhV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFji-Ngz8YfW4jmcsMm2uolAZfhWHg51WySgiu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtlG0eU8vkfrSpn_6ewu023-ZxlneuhZNpbJz7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzS1Aahin6haYFm-ZhAP8P7ApR3q3U4pAb2-gM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNA_cwGKlX-gF1PUDcv3N-qRhyQrY0fP9F7FMrY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJTOT7vujzARmHEKG-IPVmH5VQAaZe2tWN_uNL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1TU2W43HrHZxX4_UjD26xk9UVIn-iJsi6cO6j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

My daughter and I worked with Cheryl of Tehama to have her wedding there in April 2021. We met with Cheryl and found her to be very professional.we consulted vendors who loved working with Cheryl and confirmed she was very qualified to handle our wedding. We were very excited after meeting her and she answered our questions and again we felt very comfortable with her.

We asked her if she was committed to doing our wedding in April and she said she would be retiring in about a year but promised us she would be there in April to coordinate the wedding.

She sent us a deposit form and we sent the check. Tehama, with out letting us know, terminated Cheryl and then cashed our deposit check. They did not let us know that Cheryl would not be doing our wedding, or tell us who her replacement would be. They failed to disclose this information and deposited our check anyways.  After a few weeks of no response from Cheryl or Tehama, we contacted the Food and Beverage manager who said Cheryl was no longer there and new nothing about our wedding. We contacted vendors who said they were very concerned about Cheryl being gone and that we should be concerned.

We lost confidence and asked for our deposit back.

Tom the general manager and I discussed the matter and my daughter and I had discussed the refund..

Tom came back and agreed the termination had happened during our making the deposit but has defused to return the whole deposit. The way Tehama has handled this has devastated our daughter and we both feel that Tehama did not properly disclose to us Cheryl would not be there and cashed our deposit anyways.

They misrepresented who we would have at Tehama and want to keep the deposit. We will update this if Tehama properly refunds the deposit to my daughter. If they don’t you should not trust them with your very special event.<//Text>

<Text>I am a Monterey wedding planner and I absolutely love working with Tehama and weddings here are nothing short of perfection.
I have planned several weddings at Tehama and always really enjoyed working with all their incredible staff but also everyone that works in banquets is kind, friendly, and so wonderful at what they do.
The property itself is beautiful, from the minute you enter and see their beautiful courtyard with the gardens and fountains its just breathtaking.
The ceremony deck offers unencumbered views of the ocean and Monterey Bay, while the golf course is nestled in the golden hills of Carmel Valley.
Their food is also really top notch. Often beautiful venues fall flat when it comes to the food but not Tehama. They really deliver a stellar experience all around. I highly recommend them if you are looking for the perfect venue for your wedding.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Hands down the best customer service. Very knowledgeable on the tools they sell and by far the best small engine mechanics in North County.

<text>Beware!  This repair shop charges $30 just to LOOK to see what's wrong with your item.  They dismantle the item, and at this point, they ask for a ridicules amount of money to repair.  If you retrieve your item without fixing it  , they charge an undisclosed amount of money to reassemble it.  They gave me my item completely disassembled in a carton box.  BTW, I waited 4 weeks for this negative result and experience.< /text><name>Chris Ames< /name>< user>

<Review>Had a busted primer fuel line on a leaf blower.  The got me in and out in 15 minutes and charged me all of $0.65.

You can't beat that.

Update some months later.  Brought a wood chipper that I didn't purchase there to them.  They were loathe to bother with it as I didn't buy it there but agreed.  Took about 3 weeks but they identified the problem and fixed it.

The truly impressive part was when I went to pick it up.  I confess I was skeptical of their diagnosis and I guess it showed.  They had taken pics of the problem, which thoroughly convinced me, and then their main repair guy spent about 20-30 minutes with me discussing the issue and brainstorming ways to avoid it.  IMO this was some seriously useful service.  And it was no extra charge.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

If I could give negative stars I would. Briggs and Stratton website says they are an authorized repair shop. I call for repair for a Briggs and Stratton engine and they say they only work on items they sell. Really? So you don’t want business? Imagine Best Buy or another shop saying we only work on computers we sell. What a complete joke. Would never buy from these people.<//Text>

You should understand that being " authorized " does not mean " obligated " . We are authorized to perform warranty repairs, not obligated to repair any equipment that comes in. We choose our brands very carefully to provide both quality and support after the sale. Our repair shop is an extension of our sales department. I appreciate your concern about our business, but comparing us to Best Buy is really a pretty low standard that I feel we are well above at this time.'}< /resp>

After waiting 3 weeks for them to tell me the part I was told them was broken, was in fact broken, it took them another week to tell me that they hadn't ordered a replacement part since they didn't have enough parts to order.  This was a power washer and the part was a $50 carb.  But of course they found other parts that were broken (they weren't).  Ordered the carb myself, picked up the power washer where they refused to refund the $30 dollar charge for telling me the part I said was broken was broken.  My experience was this place was a rip-off and waste of time.  Took me 5 minutes to install a new carb and the power washer is perfect.  This place is a joke.

I also enjoyed the owner David's insulting commentary on Yelp berating me for leaving a public review of their poor service.  There are plenty of other repair shops, go there instead< /review><Resp>{'time': 1569017127712, 'text': "Seth, Thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and constructive review and it was such a pleasure meeting you this morning.\nWe're sorry we did not meet your expectations, but truth is, we didn't know how important you and your pressure washer that sat in your garage for three years unused were.

<Review>Called today talked to Josh and asked him about getting my chainsaw sharpen he said 9 off bar or 11 on the saw. Came in knowing it would take 24hrs but Josh and the tech in the back said wait 5 minutes. All done after that I inquired on busing a sharpening tool for 40 or just come back and have them do it like a pro for 11. So short and sweet, they well have a customer for life with anything that I can't do myself.<//Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) The store is well stocked with several brands and climbing equipment for tree trimmers, the equipment is a bit more expensive than in online stores, but if you need it, the tool is soon a good place to find what you need!

<text>Best poke i’ve had and the staff was incredibly nice! The Australian man who helped us (didn’t catch his name) was super informative on the menu and was very accommodating. You could tell he just wanted the best for the customer which I really respect. The food was perfectly portioned, seasoned, and made. Highly recommend this location!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

We love coming here! They definitely have the best poke in the area and it's a plus that the staff is overly friendly. Their ingredients and fish are always super fresh and vibrant, which I can't say for a lot of the other poke shops close by...probably since they have less orders their food sits around longer.

Another thing we love about this spot is that they do collaborations bowls with popular chefs from other famous restaurants around LA so the menu is always changing! I personally usually get the fish bowls and they're always spot on but if I'm feeling I want to go more healthy I go with the Plant-Based bowls which have more veggies and are lighter on the ole gut.<//review>

I went to Sweetfin a few times at their Santa Monica location and loved it, but they finally opened a location closer to me and didn't disappoint! I loved the bamboo rice with kelp noodle. Poke was delicious and high quality and the sauces and veggies were all perfect. Would highly recommend. thanks Sweetfin!</Text>

<Review>Visited LA this past week and stopped by Sweetfin Burbank. Never had poke like this. Was amazingly fresh. Bold flavors yet super healthy.  Went with the Yuzu salmon and added crispy onions, shiso and chili oil over the block forbidden rice. Whole menu was gluten free...big plus!<//Review>< pics>

Sweetfin rocks. Every time I’ve ordered from this location the food has been timely, fresh, and most of all delicious. I love the BYO bowl, there are so many options and I get to customize based on whatever I’m feeling that day. I could eat Sweetfin daily!</text>

<text>Hands down, one of my all time favorite places to get a quickly healthy bite in LA. I was thrilled to hear the Sweetfin team opened a Burbank outpost! I ordered my usual Yuzu Salmon bowl over bamboo rice and like clockwork the fish was so fresh & flavors spot on.

Really appreciate the freshness of the food at this place, clean and beautifully designed space and the service is friendly. The quality of their ingredients is very clear in eating their food. I enjoy customizing my own poké bowl and feel good about eating it!!! Happy to have them in the neighborhood!</text>

Second time here and it had been a while between visits. The meat looks thick and marbled through out as it did the first time I was there. All the meat in the market is organic. I was surprised to see they had organic vegetables which was a nice surprise. They offer bacon that you can choose from that is thick or thin. There are seasoned chicken thighs or seasoned whole chicken to choose from.<//Text>

I went to Main Street Meats for the first time to order a prime rib for Christmas.  At the time I thought the place was pretty cute, and the deli menu looked good. I came back to order a sandwich today.  The woman who worked behind the counter was talking loudly to an employee--and she was not wearing a mask.  This is the height of the pandemic, and masks are required by the city/county in all businesses.  I asked her nicely why she didn't have her mask on.  She yelled at me, "BECAUSE I AM TALKING!"--Wow. Rude.  Then she called for another employee to help me.  I was not interested in ordering from the deli after her rudeness and lack of attention to County Health requirements.  I won't be back.< /Text>

Easily the best meat market on the Central Coast. It is small but always has a nice selection of meats.  The deli part of the business may serve the best sandwiches in Ventura, too.</Text>

Been there many times and will continue to go back! Sharon and staff are great. Food and products are top rated, and worth every cent spent.  Organtic, local and /or wholesome is the only way to describe what Main Street Meats has to offer. Oops, I forgot huge portions on the lunch menu!
Absolutely one of my families favorite places!< /review>

Main Street Meats not ONLY has the BEST well meat in town - but the staff is knowledgeable and wickedly helpful.  Cut up a whole chicken, SURE,  Give you a crash course in how to cook a Prime Rib roast,  OK no time for Prime Rib - so a New York Roast - FREE seasoning.  CUSTOMER SERVICE EXTRAORDINAIRE.  And for you Porterhouse steak fans - This IS the only place to by a beautifully aged one.  On a budget - no worries - their signature 'sirloin hamburger mix' will please ANYONE who eats beef - small patties between butter lettuce with a slice of ripe tomato always garners rave reviews from my friends.  Bottom Line.  You can not go wrong buying your meat here !

OH yeah they usually have nice russet potatoes, an assortment of deli meats and even dessert - can you say "one stop shopping'!

I have absolutely no affiliation with this establishment, other than loyal customer.<//review>

Excellent selection of meats and sides to prepare at home or made to order sandwiches.  The meats are prime quality and can get expensive - so choose wisely for your budget.  I’ve enjoyed the t-bones and ribeyes, but come away much lighter in the wallet.</Review>

<text>Gave this place multiple tries at a cost of hundreds & hundreds of dollars. Pork is decent, ground beef is decent but the steaks are tough as leather. Tried all steaks from porter house to ribeye and they just don't stand up to other organic farmed meat in the Venture area. If I am paying 40 plus dollars for a couple steaks, I want to be able to chew them!.< /text><Rate>1</Rate></record>

At the deli counter I ordered the tri-tip sandwich and the pulled chicken bowl.  Both were very delicious and nicely priced.  The meats for sale at the butchers counter looked great, but were pretty expensive.</review>

Sharon never once smiled while helping us, then gave us a fork instead of a spoon, part of the lettuce was wilted. Looked as if she was overworked and then her help just left her...There were 2 customers waiting for about 15 minutes to be helped while she finished with us.  Not crazy about the service that day although I have been here before and always had a friendly face.< /Text>

The price for organic meats is the same as Costco, and you can buy smaller quantities. Plus they are much closer.< /Text>

Delicious  tacos just like the ones from Mexicali. No need to go across the border, and make more than hour to cross. Love their tacos, salsas  and excellent  service.
Five star  service, thank you to all who work there. And to the owner keep up the DELICIOUS  food.<//review>

Authentic Mexican food on the California side of the border. They were playing Mexican soap operas on the TV when we were there. Slow service, but tasty food.<//Review>

Most recommended Chill spot to go. Friendly staff, awesome social food. Located across from SDSU campus in Calexico. If the next time you want to stop and grab a quick coffee or need to refuel. Stop at this location. Loved it. Also, a great place to bring a date.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Whenever I'm in El Centro I go for some tacos from here the girls had treated me very well until I arrived around 9:00 pm, I asked for tacos to go and the boy in the box made me look ugly because I asked for separate orders. Then I sat down to wait and another boy made an ugly face and stopped to talk with the one in the box with his back to me. Sangrones!

(Original)
Siempre que estoy en El Centro voy por unos tacos de aquí las muchachas me habían tratado muy bien hasta que hace poco llegue como a las 9:00pm, pedí tacos para llevar y el muchacho de la caja me hizo cara fea porque pedí ordenes separadas. Después me senté a esperar y otro muchacho me hizo cara fea y se paro a platicar con el de la caja dándome la espalda. Sangrones!<//Text>

The owner of this wine shop is a spectacular person! He is knowledgeable about his wine. But more importantly, he is a wonderful human being. He is wise, funny, entertaining and full of energy. I could have talked to him for hours. I hope we have the opportunity to cross paths again during our lifetimes.< /Review>

< Review>
This store is the absolute best!if you have a chance, look at the attached pictures. Words do not begin to describe how large a selection of rums, whiskey, scotch, cognac, brandy, gin, etc. This store is slightly smaller than their main store off of El cajon boulevard.

If you are looking for something Specific to either enjoy, or as a gift, kegel bottle is definitely a place worth visiting. Regardless of the type of alcoholic beverage you are looking for, they will have that selection.  The prices they charge for their selection are completely reasonable, too. They do have some drinks that they will have on sale. On the hole, everything in there is completely reasonable in price with a selection that isn't matched anywhere else in the San Diego area!</Review>

We ended up buying three bottles and we got wine glasses for free! Sophia was very well-informed and supportive. I suggest them highly!<//review>< pics>

I wish I knew the cashiers name... So I could give her all the credit. I see she is very busy though, so I never bother to ask.

She is there most of the time and I notice she is friendly to all customer's and she does it all with a smile) Amazing.<//text>

I am so happy to report that Keg N Bottle is now carrying Rothaus Tannenzäpfle!! ❤ I have been on a quest to find it in San Diego for years! Today my dream came true 🤩 The store is highly organized and they carry a very large variety of everything. Easy off the 805 and excellent parking. Frank the manager is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  Go see Frank and buy this beer!!! Cheers 🍻</Review>

I want to thank my Man Ferris & Keg & Bottle for the help in the store. Sometimes it could hard working behind the counter and dealing with so man people. But You know what it's people like me that will come in and briten up the days of others. But not only me, there are other people that think to pick others and appreciate them for what they in the community that we work in or just Bing able to be a part of. I use to come in to this store alot when I was working for Move Central. Me all the guys. And you guys have always been kind to us and treated us with respect so I thank you all that work at the Square. My family to yours</Review>

All I can say about this place is WOW!!! I had never seen so many bottles of what ever you desire to drink in one place. There's bottles from every part of the world. The lady that works there she tells me that their store in el cajon blvd. Is twice as big. That's my next visit point. Awesome place to visit.</text>

<gmapID>0x80dc0716099fe83b:0xfc7a4a90238f42b5</gmapID><text>A one stop shop for fine spirits and craft beer. A hidden gem tucked away in sorrento valley. I knew the place existed, ive lived in the mira mesa area for a long time. but searching for different expressions of scotch to try led me here for the first time. To say their selection is amazing is an understatement.  Have you been wanting to try a particular whisky that you cant find anywhere locally? Do you have a favorite distillery but cant find their other expressions/offerings? Looking for vintage/rare? This place probably has it. Their prices are not too competitive, tbh, but i felt they were fair considering they stock so many different kinds that ive only ever seen online. If scotch isnt your thing, their bourbon and irish selection was just as impressive. Staff was super helpful and patient and made great recommendations. Will be visiting again when its time to try something new.< /text>< resp>

This place is so cooooool! Tonight was my first visit, and it literally looks like a library, but with booze. Shelves on shelves, equipped with ladders on tracks. I would come here just for the experience!! It's a must-see spot in San Diego!< /Text>

This is my go-to place in San Diego for a wide variety of Whiskeys. All though Keg N Bottle is widely known for their huge craft beer selection,  they are a major player for Whiskey enthusiasts like myself. The store in Sorrento Valley is my favorite. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and always helpful.< /Review><Time>1555806068074</Time>< Gmap_id>

Prices are a bit high on their Bourbon & Scotch, but that is to be expected for maintaining one of the best selections in San Diego.< /review>

<Review>Huge selection, if you want a keg they don't have in stock it's only a day away. They refill CO2 for the cheapest I've seen. And if you want beer they have an INSANE selection. The staff are so friendly and helpful and even help you load your car. Would recommend, I'll be a repeat customer.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>This store is selling sakes that are "EXPIRED and HAVE GONE BAD".  Please don't go into this store unless you want to walk out with bottles of expired alcohol.  I purchased three bottles of sparkling sake on 12/21/2012 from there and found out later that they were produced in 2009 and should be consumed within 120 days.  Plus, the sakes were not being stored properly.  They were just sitting on the self at room temperature when clearly on the bottle's label, "Keep Refrigerated"  No wonder not only there's no bubble when opened plus the taste was awful.  I even asked the owner about the expiration date because I saw a set of date (21.9.24) on the cap.  The owner assured that the sakes are fine and even if that's the expiration date, it should be either year of 2021/2024 so they are all good.  Later I googled and found out that the number 21 is era in Japan which corresponds to year of 2009 in Western era.  Even if the owner didn't know how to decode the date on the cap, he sure should have known those three bottles of sparkling sake have been on the shelf "FOREVER" and should be taken down instead of selling to people.  Since I bought the last three bottles I even asked if they will be getting more.  Answer I got was, yes, we always restock our inventory and in fact, order has been placed.  "LIAR! LIAR! LIAR!"  "SUCH TERRIBLE STORE!"< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc0716099fe83b:0xfc7a4a90238f42b5<//Gmap_id><Rate>2< /Rate><Response>None<//Response><user_id>117815921001342029954</user_id>< time>

<Review>Every time I enter this store the men that work there are very rude ...especially to women! There can be nobody in the store and they'll choose to do other things rather than help the one customer that is in there ! Don't think will be visiting the store ever again ...it's happened at least three times in the last four visits!👎</Review>< Pictures>

Always remodeling this place. You have to wait for anyone of the 3 or four clerks to stop talking to each other loudly to finally acknowledge your existence.  Then you actually get to pay your hard earned money to them for their over priced stuff.< /text>

I'm usually the only person here whenever I visit. Prices are fair. They aren't the cheapest you'll find, but they are pretty average. I don't think this place gets visited by "Beer Geeks" very often, so I can sometimes find some great beers that are sold out in other locations.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>The community at St. Cyprian Church is a delight. They graciously opened their doors to my daughters High School and made their facilities available during our quest for a permanent home. They couldn't have been more supportive, kind, generous and open.   Thank you, St. Cyprian!<//Review>< Pictures>

Over a month ago, they fixed the headphone plug-in area on my phone & did a nice job! (I wanted to give it a month before reviewing to see how it turns out) the reason i say 4-half if i could is because i'd say they could work on being a lot more clean & more friendly of service (not that they weren't) the guy was very nice. But no one wants to see stuff scattered everywhere behind the counter. & maybe play some music it was quiet. But they did my phone a good job & it took less than an hour so good job yall!</review></record>

I had to get my screen fixed. This place was referred to me by a friend. I spoke with Jake and brought my phone in next day. Screen repair was done in less than 30 minutes. It was an awesome price compared to the other places I inquired at. Phone looks great! I highly recommend!<//review>

My 13 year dropped her IPhone XS Max in water and the phones screen went black. She didn’t give me the phone til the next day and I put it in a bag of rice and immediately resorted to ask Google what to do after my iPhone has been exposed to water damage, this shop was the first to pop up. I was super happy that it was conveniently located in downtown Riverside, super close to home. Monday could not come any sooner and as soon as 11am hit I called to see if an appointment was needed, my call was not answered but “Jake” returned my call almost immediately and said I could just walk in. The shop was super easy to locate, I walked in, was greeted immediately and “Jake” was super friendly and professional and he had my daughter’s phone back in working order in under 30 minutes! I am SO grateful I found this place and that “Jake” saved my daughter’s phone and more importantly saved me from buying her a new one, LoL.... I recommend this shop 100%!< /Review>

<text>TWO DAYS before cross country travel, I got "the black screen of death" on my iPhone 6. Zak gave my black screen life. He was open on a Sunday afternoon and I was in and out of his shop in 30 minutes. While he was checking me in he gave me some good recommendations for coffee and food nearby and made me feel comfortable that he knew what the problem was and how to make it right. He checked in with me before making repairs and gave me some maintenance advice that was indispensable. Zak is the quintessential professional and a great small business owner. I couldn't recommend this business and this person more.</text>< Pics>

This man did such an amazing job repairing my front screen! Despite the closing of many stores, he adapted to the new changes and picked up my device. There was easy communication, a very affordable price, and extremely quick repair work. It was dropped off and ready to pick back up in just a little over an hour! Very good at what he does and am looking forward for my next fix up soon with Zak.<//Review>

<text>Did a very great job on repairing my phone. I went in as my phone fell in water and was no longer turning on. I told him it would probably need a new battery and screen. He opened it and rather than trying to upsell me a battery and screen protector, he told me only a screen was needed for repair. The repair was done extremely well and quickly.<//text></record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I dropped my phone on and was running around with a cracked screen for a while. Works for a while until it doesnt. Zak was the only game in town on a sunday for same day phone repair and I am glad to have gone to him.
His rates were on par for what I saw other places doing the same repair for and he was able to take care of my phone within an hour after dropping it off. I sincerely appreciate his service and amiability as well as him taking the time to explain the repair.
He also provides other electronics services so dont just go to him on a sunday! I will be taking my watches in to have their batteries replaced when the time comes.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb1efa084b1ed:0xe9aa34782534a05f< /Gmap_id></record>

Zak was very helpful and walked me through pretty much everything about what it would take and cost to get my phone fixed. Wasn't the cheapest place I found when researching but definitely the best in quality and customer service so it was worth the extra $10. Would definitely come back for any repairs or just to talk.<//Review>

<Review>I looked around to compare prices for a screen replacement on a Pixel 2 XL, spoke over the phone, was given a very reasonable quote compared to other cell phone repair shops nearby and assured the parts for the screen replacement would arrive in the following days. Showed up the following Monday, talked to Zak to hand over the phone and he explained the repair would take no longer than an hour so I left to finish some errands. Returned and Zak not only had the screen as good as new, but he also applied a liquid glass protection that included a year warranty and he reassured me if I had any other issues I could return to ask him before going elsewhere to pay out of pocket. I did wait a few weeks to make sure the screen held up before writing this review and I have had zero problems with the screen, it is as good as new! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for reliable, quality phone or tech repair!< /Review>< rate>

<text>These guys are a lifesaver. Cracked my iPhone 7+ screen while here on vacation. Apple said next repair appointment was a week away. Best buy wanted $250.  These guys got me patched up on short notice in an hour and stayed past closing time to do it. $140 all in. Unless you have apple care you'd be a fool to not use these guys. Quicker service for less money than the big guys.</text>< user_id>

<Review>Highly recommended for great service! The staff is polite and very knowledgeable. They are transparent with all the service they provide, and have very comparable pricing. Plus they have a great location, so if you're getting service done, you can literally walk down the street and grab some food. Win win.

UPDATE: The management has very recently added packing & shipping services!!! I believe they're also adding copy & print services as well.<//Review>< Pics>

Had high hopes for one of the only 5-star repair shops. Went in for a screen & camera swap for my iPhone X on 1/25, paid $140 for the screen, but turned out to be a mediocre LCD display instead of the OLED panel it should have been. Thought it was a mistake, but it turns out an OLED panel is an extra $40 charge.

Waited a week for them to order it and was willing to pay the extra fee. Eventually went to the shop and had it swapped out, but in the process they damaged one of the sensors on the front of the phone, so now Face ID doesn't work. They said they'd do some research to find what's wrong, and if needed, I'd drop my phone off for a few days to have their micro-solder tech fix it, while I use a loaner phone provided by them. They were going to call me in a few days to schedule this.

I initially went to the shop on January 25th. It is now March 5th, and I still haven't received a call asking me to come in so my phone can be repaired. Have been texting and calling them all throughout, with repeated promises that they'd get back to me soon. Texted the owner again this Monday and was told he'd contact me "in the next day or two". It's been three days and I'm not very hopeful. At this point, I'm not sure I'd trust leaving my phone with them, because I'm not sure when I'd get it back.

I understand the owner has been having some difficulties outside of work that make him unavailable, and I sympathize with that. However, there's been hardly any communication, and after weeks, my phone's Face ID still doesn't work thanks to whatever happened during the repair. At least they didn't charge me the extra fee for the OLED...

PS. At least post accurate hours! Stopped by at about 4pm a couple weeks ago, on a weekday, and the place was closed? Okay.<//review>

Zak did an incredible job at fixing my phone. I had the infamous pink line and a cracked screen on my Samsung Galaxy 7. Zak was able to find the right parts and repair the screen in a day at an affordable rate. Additionally, he was very friendly and professional when servicing my phone. This is the best experience I have had at a phone repair shop and I have been to 6 different shops.

What made the experience unbelievably convenient was Zak also helped me with printing out some important documents I needed quickly for my meeting downtown. What a great service they also have in addition to their hardware repairs.

Go to Phone|Home repair if you want the job done right!< /review>

It took them almost a month to fix my broken screen. Every time I called, the person said they would call me back and they never did.  When they finally fixed my screen, it turned out to be smaller than the original screen so now my phone has a gap between the screen and the frame< /Text>

First off - excellent location! Right in the heart of Downtown Riverside. The shop is in a historic building with some old school murals on the ceiling - super cool.
As for the repair: I got my screen fixed here a couple weeks ago. I have to say, it was a wonderful experience. Zak diagnosed my problem immediately and was very knowledgeable about the products (my screen options, what he had in stock), and willing to go the extra mile to ensure I got my screen working again. He was very honest about my repair and the cost of the products. In all I ended up paying less than I anticipated (considering other stores), a LIFETIME WARRANTY, and got a quality screen that is allowing me to type this right now! I highly reccomend this store. Also, while I was waiting, I noticed a wide product selection (cases, charging cables, screens, etc.).
Added bonus: I found out this store is locally owned!</Review>

I needed to have my LCD screen repaired on my Samsung galaxy. After calling around to a few places in Riverside, I called Ivium.io and spoke with the owner, Zak. The part I needed was in stock, and Zak was able to repair it that day and at a lower price than other stores in Riverside. Additionally,  Zak is very nice and attentive, and makes you feel as if you are his only customer. I would definitely go back and recommend to others.<//review>

I dropped my iPhone yesterday in the middle of the street. Flat down. The screen shattered. Ugh. I didn't know what to do so I checked Yelp. I found Phone Home right away. Being downtown was very close and convenient for me. I called and spoke with Zak and he informed me he would be able to replace the screen with a new official Apple OEM LCD screen. I never even thought to ask about this. He said you can get a screen replaced for less expensive but it won't be as good of quality as the official Apple product. I took my phone in to Zak this afternoon and spent 30 minutes enjoying the downtown Dickens Festival. I came back and my iPhone was as good as new! So happy. I'm so glad I found Phone Home here on Yelp and of course with all 5 Star reviews. Couldn't be easier than the experience I had. I will refer all my friends here! So convenient and great customer service! Thank you!<//review>

Zak was great! He is super personable quick and efficient. I previously had my phone repaired at a stand at the mall. They did a terrible job and busted some parts inside my phone. Zak showed me exactly what was wrong and replaced them completely free of charge. He gave me a super deal. I'd definitely go back. He does quality work.<//review>

<review>I called about my husband's phone, gave the model number and was told to bring it in the following day for repair of the screen. After finding the inconvenient location, we dropped the phone off and were told to return 2 1/2 hours later. No biggie,  I found some stuff to do to kill the time and returned to pick up the phone after 2 1/2 hours only to find out they didnt have the screen in stock and couldn't do the repair. No phone call or anything- super disappointing and  half a day wasted.< /review>< Pics>

After performing a more-than-usual amount of iPhone SE repairs this week, you did indeed catch me at a low stock level for replacement parts for that particular device. It was sort of a double wammy; it seems like the last battery and last black screen I had stocked both were having issues.\n\nAfter offering my sincere apologies to you, and my appreciation for your patience, and after you agreed to continue your repair the next day, I did make a special order specifically for your repair and purchased overnight shipping to make sure your parts arrived. As you were quite insistent on needing things done quickly, I left precisely 5 screws and one bracket out of the device, with the understanding that you would be back early the very next day.\n\nThese, of course, are not brackets or screws that would even remotely put your device at risk of any sort of damage. Because you seem to be in quite a rush, it was my intention to save you some time the next day by having the inside of your device prepared for a very swift screen replacement. I would then reassemble your device the way I do all devices, and make sure that every single screw that was taken out of the device is put back in the exact same place it was before. Sometimes screws are actually missing from the device when I open them up! If this is ever the case, I always, always include my own screws myself unbeknownst to the customer, and never at an additional charge.\n\nIt is my goal to make every customer super happy and rave about our shop to friends and family. We've had the distinct pleasure of making a good reputation of honesty and integrity with our wonderful customers. In the very [very] rare instance that we are unable to accommodate a customer in a time frame that works with them, it is quite disappointing for me personally. I dislike falling short in any way when it comes to customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce again Daniel, I apologize for inconveniencing you. I can whole-heartedly appreciate your frustration.

don’t let zak Work on your phone , he gave me my phone back worse then when I took it in. The battery he put in was not hooked up right he left 8 screws out and gave me the wrong screen. He completely wasted an hour and a half of my time . To make it worst I called a head and he said I have those in stock , in fact I believe he said I keep those in stock. So I took my phone to a better place. A big thank you to iPhone pros in riverside..<//text>

Zak was great. Very friendly and professional. Repaired my iPhone, and provided a screen saver at a competitive price. His location is convenient and was very efficient in repairing my phone. I would recommend his business/service to anyone.<//Review>

<review>I didn’t like how the parking wasn’t convenient but when I walked in I loved the vibes I got. I think it was Matt that helped me (not sure tbh) but I walked in for messed up speaker (after attempting to fix my own phone and I ended up running ) the guy was so friendly and he straight up told me how easy it was to fix my phone and didn’t charge me. Highly recommend this for people with phone issues<//review>< pics>

I walked in off the street and Zack greeted me immediately. After a couple minutes, he told me that he could repair my phone without a problem.

My phone is an older phone that is no longer being made (Samsung Galaxy Alpha). I have been to a couple other shops who told me they couldn't fix it unless I found the parts myself.

Zack got the parts and had it fixed pretty quickly.<//review>

This is my second time using the service that ivium.io provides . Zack is always a pleasure to deal with from setting up the appointment to getting the service done. The prices are fair and the quality is very consistent from customer service down to the repairs . Thank you zack for your time and business. I’ll try to be more careful with my phones, but it is a true peace  of mind knowing your here to help . Thank you for the quick service and getting me out before the meter expired :)<//Text>

<review>Not long ago, I noticed that my charger port to my IPhone 6s was not working properly. The cables seems to be consistently flimsy and was having a hard time keeping a charge. I was looking for a local shop to check out the issue and came here to Phone Home.

I talked to Zak and he mentioned that he was about to get it done in under an hour. I figured I can go next door and have a cup of coffee while he took care of the charger port.

Finished my coffee, came back to the store, and in less than an hour, had a brand new charger port installed.

Zak was very attentive to what needed to be solved. Found the problem, said no problem, and solved it.

For any cellphone needs, come to Phone Home, talk to Zak. I’m definitely coming back for anything that has to do with phone repair.

Very knowledgeable and professional.< /review>< Pics>

<review>One day I had accidentally dropped my Iphone 7 which resulted in the screen shattering. Afterwards it would turn on but the screen was not responsive. I didn't know what was wrong with it since I don't know much about phones or their components. On my laptop I began to search for repair shops, and lo and behold, I came across this one! I was drawn in by the stellar reviews which led me to believe that it was a great place to get a phone repaired.

I called the store and the owner, Zak, answered my call. We had a quick exchange of my little dilemma and he gave me a  great quote that was very reasonable and he informed me that my screen and digitizer needed to be replaced. I headed down there and Zak had taken care of the repair within the same hour! I was quite satisfied with his expertise, the prices, the establishment, and the professionalism that Zak and his team possess. I would recommend this repair shop to anyone who winds up in a similar dilemma!</review>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>I definitely recommend Phone Home. So far I have brought an  iphone 6 and a 1st generation ipad, both had cracked screens. Zak is efficient and knowledgeable with great customer service. He let me know through text, phone call or email if there was any extra services and fees that he came upon on that was not discussed previously. In the case of the iphone 6, it turned out to be more than just a cracked screen.  Zak let me know ahead of time before he proceeded to work on the phone.  Not only did he do a great job fixing the problem, his prices are very reasonable.  One of the things I like about Phone Home is that it is really close to where I work.  The location is convenient.  I drop the phones with Zak and a few hours later It is done.  No need to wait for days to get my stuff back.  In conclusion, I'm glad I found this place.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Highly expensive for a swap meet. Good gear, but you might as well shop directly from the wholesale vender at these prices.<//Review>

<Text>Decent little indoor swap meet. Wish it was a little bigger but they carry the basics. Definitely worth stopping by and checking out if your in the area. Shoes, fashion, cell phone and accessories, food, cloths, sound systems and even Tattoos.< /Text>< pics>

Great place to bring the family. Food & games are readily available.
And best of all is the affordability. Ill shop there forever.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I give the Indoor Swapmeet of Stanton 5 stars. Its always great going for the great deal on merchandise and get some snacks at little Mexico. I mostly go to GP Uniforms and A-1 T-SHIRTS, but also for good watch guy located between the two above business stands. Whatever happened to the Virgin Mary that was outside?< /text>

<text>This is where my hubby takes all my jewelry to be cleaned or fixed.  The jewelry guy is on the first floor to the right.  Nice guy, fixed my chain to my necklace I wear everyday and my husband gave to me on our 20th anniversary...we will be celebrating our 50th anniversary next year.  The jewelry guy was able to fix a break in chain which is very delicate... Thank you...you are the best< /text><Time>1565625745577< /Time></record>

I am an artist and part owner of Olde Realm Tattoo on the second floor. Management has been great in providing a great atmosphere inside the building. Very festive during holidays. The shop owners are friendly people. We have a bit of everything here. Whether you want a pedicure, a pair of the newest shoes, or even a tattoo on your arm; we have it all here at the Stanton Indoor Swap meet. Welcome!< /text>

Busy crowded market. I went to get my eyebrows waxed. I like the salon as they cater to my needs. Ask for Helen who does the best job. You can have hair cuts perm highlights, manicure, pedicure, facial and many more. The perfumer downstairs is very well stocked. Fred gives perfumes at affordable prices compared to the mall! He is the best and I buy most of my perfume from him.<//text>

<review>Always clean and the vendors are pretty nice. I go here for the cell accessory lady directly to the left of the entrance. She always hooks you up with deals on cases and screen protectors for your phones, especially when bundling multiple items. Check her out if you need quality protectors at better prices. You could order on amazon but if you prefer in person seeing before purchase type deal then make it out to her if you can and tell her Frank sent you.<//review>< pics>

Not even sure if I want to give 2 or 3 stars... It's has a good range of items however it is a bit pricey and most of the venders are not too friendly. There was only one that I can recall in my many trips here that stood out to me for being kind, helpful and over-all pleasant. The other venders either follow u too close with assumptions that you will steal which makes it an unpleasant experience. I don't like walking hand n hand with the clerk who is not even communicative. So.. I would honestly have to say, go on down the road a bit more to a more better place to spend your hard earned cash.</text>

I love coming here specifically for the churros. My husband shops here for his work t-shirts and belts. I also come here to get my eyebrows threaded. It's budget friendly for me and the lady does a nice job threading my eyebrows. You can find almost anything here or any kind of services that you need. I'm thinking about coming back to get accupunture done here as well.
Update
I recently had my nails done here at an affordable price. It was 18.00 for a gel polish over my natural nails. I posted a picture of my nails. This color has stayed on for 2 weeks now without any chips or scratches.</review>

However avoid the T-Shirt shop just inside the door like the plauge, the lady there is the rudest shop person I have ever encountered.  When I nicely told her she wasn't being very nice she started yelling and kicked us out of the shop.  The next shop around the right side of the stairs would be the one to go to.  Good prices and great customer service!</Review>< pictures>

My sisters and I love this place. We can get our jewelry repaired, rings resized by the nicest gentleman. We love the sweetest lady that alters our clothes! She is a really great professional. You will also find a variety of childrens clothing. Just could use a little more detail to cleaning.</text>

This place was totally cool , kind of dirty and old , lots of t-shirts and fly dope gear. They had several Game Center's with lots of cool old video games. Yea! Got the high score! If you're looking for quality car stereo equipment this is your place. Overpriced off Brands, but really nice. The food court was small , and only has Mexican food, so we had a pizza delivered it was delicious. Lawrence Fishers nephews Brothers son's best friend has a booth there that sells jewelry, it was really cool. The lights burned out in the elevator so it's completely pitch black as you go from floor to floor perfect for Halloween. nice selection of quinceaneras dresses and plenty of parking.<//text>

<text>I have come here for many years and while it won't be many people's cup of tea due to the interior, it is an amazing place if you check out the different stores here. They have a variety of stalls here, ranging from movies to vitamins and clothes. There is even a small restaurant on the landing of the stairs so you can eat while you shop!</text>< Gmap_id>

Love it there. But they changed everything. So you don't know where anything is. I got tattoos done here.. and all my ink came out of my skin the next day. And they aren't looking good for the tattoos. And also they are not always open either. So that sucks. And people there don't ever really speak english. So it sucks cuz of that.<//Text>

The vendors are not very friendly which surprised me as I like the concept. In fact I stopped in to see about renting a space for a new business. I would never put a business in this building g even though the location is busy.
Big problem is the maintenance and the interior is very dirty for a retail center.
I did find two businesses in the building that I liked but after talking with the manager of one of them I realize that my assessment was very accurate. She managed the food court. She agreed with me that the place was dirty and not very friendly vendors.
The community of Stanton where this business resides is a very rough area here in Orange County.<//Text>
