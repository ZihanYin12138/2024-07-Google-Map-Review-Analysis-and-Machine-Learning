Money well spent. I excelled due to the excellent instruction. The best school around. I am impressed. I cannot say enough good about this school. They get it done. Henry, Brad, Joe, Tatiana, Jessica, Diego, Javier, Andrew, all are pretty cool.</Review>

I would like to thank the Fresno ACI for everything they have done, to help me get to where I am today. Everett, Isaac, Rebecca, Christy and Sally, includes all the other students who have been through this with me .. we all worked as a team to help each other and always encouraged each other.. great program to go through if you are going into any Class A career, very professional and encouraging. They will help you get to where you need to be to succeed. I’m very thankful for Fresno ACI .. many thanks</text>

This is a great school. To start with things were a bit rough. This school finished great!!! I had the best scores of the day!!! Henry has made this school better. Brad has made this school better. There are a lot of students that want to stand around & complain but I figured it out. You gotta do your part and perform. You gotta study. I did well because I did my part. I am ready to go to work now.<//review>

<Text>This school has changed in just a few short weeks. 4 weeks ago it was unorganized. In came a team from other campuses. From new guy named Brad, to reliable Henry to a mgr named Everett they moved locations for skills totally lined out and ready to go over a weekend. Now it’s organized and this school will totally rock. Great job.

Thanks for the attention to students needs ACI!!< /Text>< Pics>

It’s on you. This school provides the instruction & tools to get your CDL. Then the rest is up to you. Apply yourself & success will be yours. I am super happy with ACI. I couldn’t ask for better. Great school. Great trucks. My scores at DMV proves it-

<review>I recently received my Class A. I received all my training through ACI. They really have it together now, step by step. They go over the pre trip, to air brakes, and all your backing skills, to on road driving. I want to thank all the instructors that took there time and worked with me. I  passed the first time going to the DMV. The only downside is trucks would break down alot, but they would have a replacement the next day or get it fixed. I would recommend ACI, for beginners.  If  I could do it so can you!<//review><gmap_id>0x809527bad0da0235:0xa756861f9ba51ac9</gmap_id>< user_name>

I am a new student at ACI, just started about a 3 weeks ago at the Tulare/Visali. I should of read these reviews before signing up to this school. The school is very unorganized there are to many students out in the yard and not that many instructors. The instructors are always joking around not doing anything, dont offer any help or guidance only reach out to you when you are driving and are about to crash and they dont talk politely they shout out you very unprofessional. When I first spoke with Joe the counselor, he made it sound like it was a well organized school, but it is just a front. Wish I could get my money back, I'd advise people beware before signing up to this school and read all the bad reviews because they are true.< /text>

<rate>1</rate><review>Visalia/ Tulare 24 people one truck because they didn’t put fuel in the other two trucks. No structure head instructors are immature and threaten to not allow you to drive the truck if you complain about their unprofessional and disrespectful demeanor. Wast of time and money. One instructor for three trucks you’re completely on your own most of the time with no help. You might get in a truck five times in an eight hour day.<//review>< Pics>

Enjoy this school. Environment is great and instructors help out a ton. Shop assistant (crispin) is always on top of his game and will help out with whatever you need. HIGHLY RECOMMEND anyone to sign up if you love welding or want to get started. They start from basics and help you move forward.< /review>

Thank you ACI, I am a two time graduate,  once in 2013 with class B, and just recently with a class A. Your organization has a very polite and friendly staff that helps you through the whole process. Special thanks to Dennis for great training and getting me ready to test in a timely manner so I could begin work right after i graduated.  I would highly recommend this school to everyone,
Thanks so much

From my own personal experience I would like to just say that this school definitely cares about its passing rate and the staff at ACI is willing to put in extra effort forwards the student getting their license. Not to discredit other reviews but I know first hand that some people don’t put in the effort as others and they seem upset that the instructor won’t let them just hop in a truck and drive! For your safety and everyone else’s they want you to pass the test before getting in a truck. So just because someone gives a lower rating doesn’t mean the school isn’t up to par, they definitely exceeded my expectations and the staff is willing to help you with extra hours. Patti is respectful and let me also add that Jose the new instructor definitely cares about the student and went above and beyond in helping me practice my test.<//Text>

I took the 20 week program, and I'm so glad that I did.  I got to work at my pace, and it was very beneficial to me.  I learned a lot at this school, and passed my Written and Behind-the-Wheel test on the very first try.  I graduated on Friday, and already have a job lined up.  The staff and instructors were all very helpful, and on point.  Thank you Advanced for this wonderful experience.

<Text>The training at Advanced Career Institute was great.  My instructors were great, I got my Class A. permit when I was supposed to, passed my DMV drive test on the first try.  Besides the great training, I also got to haul live freight loads.  My experience at Advanced Career Institute was one that I would highly recommend.  I took the (20) week program, and am glad I did.  Because of the experience I received from my instructors, The great Job placement they offered, I'm going to work for a freight company just (3) days after getting my license.  Thanks again Advanced Career Institute for helping me & many others out.

<Review>I recently graduated from ACI, and I feel there is no better experience and atmosphere for training in preparation for obtaining a commercial drivers license. From the administration, to the instructors, this program is beyond helpful. After going through the entire 20 week program, I feel better prepared for anything on or off the road. I know I couldn't have exceeded as easily as I did without Advanced Career Institute.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809527bad0da0235:0xa756861f9ba51ac9< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The car salesman will get you into the school by telling you whatever he needs to to get you to sign those paper. In the brochure they tell you that you’ll take you a weighers and sampling course and of course you don’t! Honestly I feel like the school is overpriced I want some of my $ back, shout out to all the student that teach themselves at this school hope you all pass!

<review>Got my CDL thru this school and wanted to thank their awesome instructors for all their patience, knowledge and help with my learning experience. Jose (Carnitas), Jesse, Robert, Danny, Tim & Jr. are awesome yard instructors and will help out with any questions you have and are very thorough with training. They will not only teach you how but will explain the reasons on why. The class room is also very informative and give you the full knowledge on safety and get you ready for your permit test. And thankful for their office staff and all their support and efforts to help me pass!< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1556894780218, 'text': 'We are so happy you feel this way.

<Text>Congratulations, once you register at this school, sooner or later you will get a truck driving license.Then you have plenty of jobs.

But the best thing for me is that I got my driver's license with the most beautiful memories that have happened to me at this school ....... Memories of barbecues, Halloween and Christmas also:) Funny moments for students and instructors. Here are a lot of great instructors and staff at ACI school I appreciate them for their wonderful efforts.

I also met a lot of wonderful new friends .... It really was one of the nicest moments.

I will miss this school very much and wish it success forever ...
thank you Mr. Everett you are the best
. If you need any help in the school  just ask Everett You'll get it .

I am currently a student at the Visalia campus for truck driving and I have nothing but positive things to say about this school. All of the instructors, front office staff, and management are great people. Everyone is very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. I came to this school with zero knowledge about these big trucks and I cannot believe the amount of information I have learned, not to mention I can drive one now! For anyone that wants to obtain a CDL I highly recommend this school.<//text>

My Name is Jose Cardenas and I want to thank everyone at ACI for helping me accomplish my life goal of getting my Class A license. all the instructors were very helpful, ACI has the best hands on learning I've ever experienced.
Thank you Juan F and Juan A for all those drives and skills you guys were really helpful in that.
Also Joaquin thank you very much for being tuff on me and not letting anything slide. You really made me memorize my pre trip inspection with those pretrip songs you make! (Hilarious)
Thank you Alondra for helping me out with my Financial you were really helpful and also thanks for letting me participate in the Halloween drawings for school it was fun!
Thank you Bobby for enrolling me!
Thanks Patti for your help.
Shout out to Raul! Thanks for that drive to the grapevine! Shout out to Jesse, Albert & Robert- "IF YOU SHAKE IT MORE THAN TWICE YOUR PLAYING WITH IT"  LMAO  Well it was awesome while I attended but now it's time to go look for a Class A job! I'm tired of seeing Matt every day!! Lol
FYI!!! DO NOT PARK INFRONT OF THE SCHOOLS WHERE THE SEMI TRUCKS ENTER AND EXIT YOUR PERSONAL VEHICLE MIGHT GET HIT AND YOU MIGHT DAMAGE THE ACI TRUCK CAUSE MY TRUCK WAS OK AND I GOT A FREE HAT FOR IT!! But Poor Freightliner the nuts bolts and hardware might not be to tight after that!! ! ✌😎< /Text>

1 star is still to much for this school. I finished the welding program and there is no structure what so ever. One of the instructors is so strict he will either just flat out tell you to re-weld, get out calilers to measure, or make up his own rules about how you you need to prep your coupons or how you need to hold the electrodes. You are supposed to be there to learn not be criticized to the point you dont want to weld. He also will not let student use certain pieces of equipment that you need to learn, you then have to wait on him to come cut the metal for you at his own pace while you wait and are not welding.Your there to learn not be criticized by someone with no welding certifications or qualifications. The owners are a joke as well all they want is your money, they would rather open a new campus then invest into the equipment at the existing campuses. They go to auctions and get old equipment instead of getting new machines. The air extraction system sucks you leave school with metal in your nose and they dont provide equipment you need to properly fit up your metal, they just say you need to know how to do it without pipe clamps but dont have pipe clamps or dont show you any other methods do fit up your metal. When I got started no one showed me what to do they said this is how it's done and then went on to sit in the air conditioned class room while I basically taught my self how to weld in a 120 degree shop in the middle of summer. If you actually want to learn how to weld and get hands on training do not go here.<//review>

One of the best decisions I’ve made out of the opportunity of schools to get my CDLs, great instructors and I highly recommend this school to anyone that wants to get their license. They’ll get you prepared that’s a guarantee but it’s all on you to get it done<//Text>

<Text>I also attended advance career institute. My experience was very negative as well. There was lots of standing around and a lack of teaching. I have to agree with the gentlemen above. The feel of the whole school was like being a heard of cattle just being cycled through for our money. There was no training on regulations or trip planning. They say they have a high rate of job placement for recent grades. But what they dont tell you is if you go out and get a job yourself they count that towards their job placement. I would take the owners recommendation and go ask the student how they enjoyed it. I know there wasnt one student who was happy with the program. There were numerous students that are planning on writing the board of post secondary education. Accredited or not this is a horrible school that you will regret within days of starting.</Text>< time>

Let me start of by saying i have never felt the need to write a review about a school or business before today. But i can not stand by all let this school rip people off. The school is a complete joke. They lie to you right from the get go just to get you into the door. All they want is your money. There is a complete lack of teaching or instructing from anyone that works there. It is hands down the worst school i have ever attended. And managed to completely turn me off to the whole trucking industry. Save yourself the grief and stay clear of this giant waste of space.< /review>

Hello I was a student at ACI visalia campus,  I recently graduated And Obtained my commercial class A drivers license on  January 5, 2018. I did the ag program.  If you are looking to get your class a drivers license I would recommend the school to anybody all the instructors are cool as hell they were so helpful I graduated on time . Thank you guys so much !!!-Albert- Robert-Mike-Joaquin-Dennis

If anybody out there has anything  negative to say about the school you should be looking for another career because trucking is not for you !!!!!!!!!!!! 🤪

<GmapID>0x809527bad0da0235:0xa756861f9ba51ac9</GmapID><Review>As one of the owners at Advanced Career Institute, I’m giving our school a 5-Star rating because of our TEAM.  I tried replying to the post of “Juan Gonzales,” but was unable to.  So I created this post...

According to Juan’s Google Review & Facebook Review, he is unhappy with our school.  First & foremost, I’m sorry to hear that...   IF there is a “Juan Gonzales” that has an issue with my school, PLEASE call me directly on my cell phone.  You can go into the front office of any of our campuses, and get my cell number (Matt Bither). I am one of the owners, and would love to talk with you if you would like.  Unfortunately as we stand right now, I have no clue who you are.  IF you do attend ACI, here’s a few issues I have run into:

1.  We have no student’s in our database by that name.

2.  We have interviewed a number of students at each campus (All had positive things to say).  Do we have things we could do to better our school?  Absolutely.  Our management team meets diligently EVERY Friday to see what we as a school could do better, to help make our school better today, than it was yesterday.  Quality training is a key factor at ACI, and we have an AWESOME Team!!!

3.  You have not responded to any of our posts.  We asked that you call our Corporate office, we never heard from you.  Our Campus Director Larry asked you to come in and talk with him, he never heard from you.  Hopefully IF you are a student at Advanced Career Institute, you will reply to my post by calling me directly on my phone, or let us know on here.

I write this lengthy post because we (Owners at ACI) take very much pride in EACH & EVERY one of our Students.  It is our main goal at ACI to get our Students quality trained in their chosen field, and help them find work.  We have MANY companies (Welding & Truck) that would be more than happy to say how pleased they are in regards to the quality of work our Students produce AFTER getting hired.  I am VERY proud of our ACI Team, and VERY Blessed to have every single student.

<Review>I definitely have to agree to all of the bad reviews for this place, I started on 9/28/15 and barely dropped out today 9/30/15, why??? well because of one of the instructors that works there, I wasn't on the Visalia campus but on the Fresno one. I wanted to take class for commercial bus training there and on the second day 9/29/15 that instructor was pretty rude to me. They know him as "Pete". I was so pissed off and I decided to drop out and now they are going to rip me off with the registration fee and the two days I was there, so I lost close to $500 just fro trying them out, and what for??? just for being seated there watching videos for three hours and for reading to memorize the pre trip inspection. What a joke, now I know its true that they just come after your hardworking money or the money from your grants. They tried to convince me to stay but since I declined all they way now theyre going to rip me off. if they would want it to make it better they would issue me a full and not a partial refund since all they gave me was some lousy paperwork and made me watch videos. Ima try to fight this rip off charges with my credit card company if they make it. And I hope one of the big guys watches this so hopefully he makes some justice. This school its not worth CRAP. They disappointed me to get in this industry, I might file a report also to every organization theyre affiliated to see if they might think twice before making business with them again.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I had a great experience with the Advanced Truck Driving School! Now the school is known as the Advanced Career Institute. I became unemployed in 2005. I had wanted to get my commercial license to drive trucks for a living. Through the WIA program at EDD that became possible. The folks at Advanced were very professional there and helped me get to my goal. "Getting my CDL". After 6 short weeks I had my CDL in hand. I graduated on a Friday and on Monday I was working! You can't beat that!  One thing that really impressed me was that when I was finding out about the school they were really interested in my background. I found out that this was because they wanted to make sure that I could get a job as a truck driver, and that I was qualified. That tells me that they were more interested in ME and not just the money. Thumbs up to Advanced!  I went to work for Werner Enterprises and eventually became a Trainer. Since then I worked for Knight Transportation and Dunns Sand in Visalia, Ca. and am still in the trucking industry. Just want to say Thanks Advanced!!< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>My mom originally found this place and bought her bedroom set here and it has lasted 20 years. I recently decided to look into getting a headboard but much to my surprise I found actually what I was looking for. I was greeted by a warm friendly face and got all my information and told them we would be back. I ended up going to serval different places but they didn't compare to this company so I ended up back there the next day and ordered my headboard frame with shelves. They did have it in stock and we set up an appointment for delivery and install. I had an afternoon appointment and they were able to squeeze me in earlier than expected and I was so thrilled. They were very good and took no time to put it together. I am completely happy with my product and I would definitely recommend this company to anyone. Thank you for making my first experience a great one.< /Review>< pictures>

We moved to Stockton recently and needed a new bed frame for our Avocado mattress. I looked up different furniture stores and chose this one based on it's reviews. I wasn't disappointed. Staff was helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. They pointed us to quite a few options they had available, since we needed a frame that would support around 600lbs (it's a heavy mattress, and we're not lightweight people). Delivery and setup was a breeze, the guys were great and quick.

We'll be back here for sure when we're ready to really get the new house set up. Their selection is great, I loved a lot of the furnishings they had to offer. Especially a gorgeous chandelier near the front door.

Definitely recommend.</text>

Simply fantastic! This is the place to go in the Stockton Area for furniture and mattresses. The product selection is absolutely amazing and the prices are great!!  This is a family run business and they treat all of their customers like they are part of the family, too. Thank you to Emmie (owner) and her team. We'll be sending our friends to your store, too. Great job!!!</Review>

<Review>Service was ok, as so was the delivery and set-up. However, the quality of the furniture isn’t the best. Especially the bedroom mattresses. A total waste of money. Also do not fall for the “warranty” it’s nonexistent.<//Review>< resp>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I have lived happily at Avalon Morrison for the past 4 years, and am bittersweetly moving on as I have purchased a home. From the modern units to the shared common area facilities, this community is a great place to live. Not to mention the close proximity to downtown, restaurants and shopping. The staff here is also amazing as well. Very helpful and friendly whenever I needed them. Would definitely recommend this community to anyone considering!< /Review><resp>{'time': 1615310162463, 'text': "Congratulations on buying a house, Shelby! That's such a great accomplishment! We're happy we were able to be here for you while you were renting and if you have any friends still looking to rent, you can always send them our way, and we'll be happy to treat them just as well!"}</resp>< userid>

We only lived here for a year but it was a great experience. The courtyard is great, its cool to be able to walk around and say hi to your neighbors that are just hanging out on the patio. The amenities are all nice and they have everything you would expect. The staff was always very responsive and helpful, and were good about communicating things to the community, especially with all the craziness of COVID going on. We have lived at a few different Avalons, so we have had multiple experiences with Miguel, who has also been at different Avalons over the years, and he is always super friendly and helpful.< /Text>

Unfortunately, we vacated after only 3 weeks here due to the constant barrage of noise pouring down on us from the unit above. Having chose to move downtown our expectations were such that we would expect a fair amount of noise, however this was next level stuff. I don't recall in nearly 25 years of renting in the bay area anything remotely as painful as this (think... kids and adults running, jumping, and crashing into stuff, late night IKEA assembly projects) Interestingly, we were never bothered once by the construction site next door, street noise, parties, Caltrain, or the planes passing over as this was all part of the downtown experience I suppose. Fortunately, Avalon were understanding to some degree and accommodating in letting us out of our lease. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we are quite happy in our new place.< /Text>

I love living here! It is super close to downtown and walking distance from many great restaurants. There is an awesome gym and pool as well. The community is amazing and super dog friendly. Ricardo has been especially helpful! He is always extremely responsive and caring. Whenever we had a problem, he helped us right away. The other staff memebers are excellent as well.<//text>

This is a great community if you don't mind the loud neighbors at night.

Let's talk about pros first. The apartment management team is great, provides excellent services. Can't speak about the amenities since it has been closed after COVID breakout. Location is good as it's walkable to wholefoods and many restaurants.

The cons is that there are some people living in the community is really careless about others. We have neighbors upstairs running in the living room with large size dog in the middle of the night and neighbors shouting & partying after 10pm. Earplugs become our best friend as we have many restless night. I don't feel home here and there is never a quiet moment. During the day there is construction noise and keeping windows open is not an option if need to focus on work related stuff. Another thing to mention is that there are cockroaches in the apartment.

If you are not sensitive to noise level and can sleep through the night, I'd highly recommend the apartment as management team is nice and location is convenient.< /text>

This is a great place to live! My partner and I signed a lease here without even visiting in person (due to COVID). Looking back at it, we are so glad we chose this place. The staff here is so incredible, especially Shaima. They truly go above and beyond to make sure issues get resolved quickly.

Building complex is in a great location, and super convenient to grocery stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joes and cafes. The apartments are clean, nice appliances, and for the most part quiet. For the amount of sq ft you get here it is 100% a win especially during COVID when a lot of us  are working from home!< /Review>

GREAT Maintenance team/office team : Today I had an issue with a leaky sink and was fearful it would not be taken care of as it was a Saturday at 3pm. Not only did Alex (Carlos is great too!) from maintenance call me right away and remedy the faulty part, Shaima from the office called to check in as well. This is best maintenance request to completion I've ever experienced! It reaffirms why I've chosen to live here for over 4 years.< /review>

Shaima answered all concerns and needs and helped me with the best customer service.

Upon moving there were some concern in my specific building, in less than a couple of minutes of raising the concern Carlos came in and assisted! Quickly and safely. The maintenance team here is amazing!

The community supervisor Miguel Gil is also very attentive and makes sure to be on top of communication about events in the property as well as changes. During these times this is very important as things are constantly changing.

Thank you team Avalon!</Review>< pictures>

The management is absolutely amazing! If you have any issues, please talk to them, they are extremely friendly and helpful people! Shaima has been the person that we had the most contact with, and she deserves a medal for her job (thank you so much Shaima if you are reading this). All concerns and issues were addressed in timely fashion and resolved perfectly. The apartment was nicely cleaned (all small details we noticed during our self-guided tour were fixed) and for everything to be put together, covid ready, I love how much less stressful it was than I had anticipated. The price for this place right now is a steal as well. You don't want to miss out on this if you get a chance!< /Text>

We are about to vacate and I wanted to take the time to write a review. My family and I have lived in 4 different corporate apartment complexes in the last 12 years, and Avalon Morrison Park is my favorite. True, no home or apartment is perfect, but this one checks nearly all of the boxes.

The Highlights:

Great Community
The neighborhood is close to perfect. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in walking distance: Whole Foods, Ace Hardware, Recycle Book Store, and plenty of coffee shops, convenience stores and restaurants. There is literally a winery next to the entrance, Coterie, which has some of the best Pinot Noir I've ever tasted. We had a courtyard-facing townhouse, which means our little kids could play safely outside and we never had to worry about them, since the courtyard is gated. Add to that our chill neighbors, and we really felt safe and welcomed here - a valuable commodity in downtown San Jose, let me tell you.

Chill Staff
Carlos and Adrian, two amazing maintenance workers, have never let me down, despite my best efforts to wreck the apartment. Joking aside, the entire maintenance staff (don't know all their names) have always been great, and their willingness to continue doing a great job during Covid definitely earns my admiration. Likewise, the office staff Miguel, Shaima and Ricardo have been nothing but friendly and polite to me and my family. They even helped out my parents when they had to evacuate their home due to wildfires. It's nice to see an apartment community keep a good office staff - these roles tend to turn over pretty frequently at the other places I rented.

Solid Amenities
Everything got shut down in March due to Covid, which seriously sucks. They opened up the gym, pool, and barbecue areas, but the reservation system is...not great. But, when they were open full time, the Gym and pool were amazing. We got in shape last year because of how easy it was to get to the gym and work out, so I hope things go back to normal for residents soon. Other great amenities include plenty of underground parking, and a good package system, although I wish the mailboxes were in the same location.

The Downsides (nothing is perfect):

1. The apartment building construction on Julian and Stockton makes its presence known; although we were in a unit that was far away, I'd hate to be in a unit closer to that. Tons of dust and noise would make living nearer the construction unbearable.

2. We never had our car broken into, but we did have three bikes stolen from the bike room - a common occurrence, we later found out. After that I locked my remaining bike to the patio wall.

3. I paid the highest PG&E bills ever in this place. I don't know if it was because of the direction we faced (south), or the 3-floor layout, but I paid nearly twice as much per month on energy than I did in a single-floor apartment with close to the same square footage.

With all that said, this townhouse with a patio, and courtyard access, is probably the best "apartment" layout you'll find in San Jose, especially if you have kids. Having a pool, gym, and barbecues was nice when they were all more accessible before Covid. Now, they just seem like pointless value-adds that you'll end up paying higher rent for, but never use.<//review>

I have been living in this apartments complex for almost 15 months, and overall, I can say nothing but the best regarding the experience, safety and service of the AMP community.
The staff is super helpful and awesome and all. I recollect more than one occasion on which the housing front desk showed great care by going the extra mile. Whether it meant generously granting temporary garage parking passes or kindly cooperating to finally locate an important mailed document!</review>

If you’re looking for a secure place to live with people who genuinely care about their tenants, Avalon Morrison Park is where you need to be. Miguel Gil, the new property manager, has gone above and beyond in ensuring that the residents (and their pets!) here truly feel welcomed and valued. We’re not just tenants. He strives to uphold the “we’re a community” aspect of this complex and that’s something I appreciate.<//Text>

This place is awesome - I love living here.  The apartment is perfect but it's the people and experiences you have in an apartment complex who make or break it.  The front office staff - Victor, Miguel, and Shaima - are fantastic.

Here are examples:
I was in the office one day and commented that people occasionally turn a corner in the complex a little fast... and a few days later 5 mph signs showed up on both sides of that corner!

I locked myself out and they not only came up and let me in, but double checked the working of the lock and then followed up by calling and asking me if I had found my keys!  Also, one time Victor sat for a good half hour fiddling with a key I had dropped so that it worked again, and then another time when the battery on a key seemed a little weak they right away replaced it with a new one.

They walk packages up to your door if you forgot to pick them up from the Amazon Hub, rather than just letting Amazon take them back.

Beyond just being helpful, they are also genuinely nice.  When you go into the office, they don't just give you incredible service, they also chat in such a friendly way that you sort of forget why you came in the first place.  They are completely invested in their jobs.

I am probably forgetting at least a dozen other nice things they have done in my 8 months I have been here, but you get the idea.

Safety -
I have never once seen a non-resident on my floor.  Everyone is always just coming and going from their places.  Honestly I have forgotten to lock my door several times and wasn't worried when I got back.  I have never seen sketchy people inside the complex, ever.

Maintenance -
They mean it when they say they fix anything in 24 hours, and that said, the only maintenance requests I had to put in were a clogged sink and a broken doorbell, both of which they fixed right away and in a courteous professional way.

Residents -
I have lived in 5 different apartment complexes in 5 different cities and I have never once been in such a friendly building.  The guy across the hall offers to help you carry groceries or heavy stuff in.  People pet your dog and chat when they're out walking their dogs.  Nobody has messy balconies or front terraces.  There is a great mix of young professionals, small families, and elderly retired people.  It's super diverse - I have met people from Japan, Greece, Iran, India and many other places.  There are often a few people around the pool, in the gym, or at the BBQ area, but never too many.  It doesn't feel crowded but it doesn't feel deserted.

Events -
At first I was skeptical about the occasional events hosted in the BBQ area but then I brought my son to the pumpkin carving and it was adorable.  Cute kids, young couples.  Someone on my hall put the pumpkin they had carved outside her door.

Apartment -
Cute, super functional, and spotless when I moved in.  Easy to make it feel like a home.

In short - best apartment experience ever.</Review>

Have lived at Avalon Morrison Park for over a year and have really enjoyed it.  Maintenance requests are always filled within a day or two of requesting and the office is very attentive.  Great amenities from a beautiful pool to a large gym and common area for parties.  Also a great location to everything in San Jose and walking distance to the Cal Train.< /Review>

I’ve enjoyed the Avalon so much that I actually moved from one of their two bedrooms to a three bedroom and renewed a lease.  The amenities are definitely a huge plus and so is the staff. I’ve have the pleasure of working with Denise and Ashley throughout my time here and they were beyond helpful when it came time to move apartments. It’s nice to have a staff that knows you and one you know you can go to for help.  I definitely recommend this property and team to anyone looking to move in the San Jose area.<//review>

I absolutely love living here! The responsiveness to our inquiries have been met with ease and efficiency!

I really appreciate Shaima for going above and beyond for us as our car recently was towed in error as we forgot to put our placard on our vehicle. Shaima reached out to the tow company and was able to handle the situation in a matter of minutes! Thank you Shaima for your attentiveness to my vehicle!

Victor has always been helpful with getting our temporary vehicle passes. It is much appreciated especially when there is something going on at the SAP center.

I appreciate all of you at the office!

Luis and Cesar came to my aid when my friend popped our 4x4’s wheel in downtown San Jose right next to the Avalon apartments. I insisted they not help but they were very friendly and insistent to help me out. Luis rolled out a wheel inflator and a jack lift while Cesar was helping me figure out how to open up the back of my Lexus to get to the spare tire. These guys saved me a lot of time and money and really went above and beyond to make sure I’d get home safe.</Review>

This review is specifically done to thank Luis for his outstanding efforts and fantastic service.

Our Air Conditioning is broken and Luis put in a lot of time to try to fix it as we move into the hottest weekend in years. Some parts needed to be ordered and he offered to supply us with a temporary portable unit to help keep the place bearable. It works great and I am writing this review from my 72 degree living room!

Thanks Luis!</review>

<text>Avalon Morrison is a wonderful place to live. I've lived here for almost a year and just renewed my lease for another 24 months. Miguel and the rest of the property management are terrific! Each time I travel, I know that management - Natalie, Rob, and Miguel will take care of my home, and my things will be in good order and well-looked after, upon my return. Kind and considerate, they hold packages that arrive almost daily, carry packages to my apartment, make sure my cleaners / guests receive my keys, take care of the place when I'm not home, and they respond to any concerns I have. Miguel is friendly, reliable, and extremely responsive; I trust he'll take of things so I don't have to worry about my living situation. If I have any concerns, he takes the time to listen and resolves it immediately. Plus, maintenance responds to all of my non-emergency requests in under 24 hours. Plus, the friendly maintenance crew keep the common areas tidy, even when the residents might not. Overall, management's thoughtful consideration and dependability give me peace of mind and create a safe and stable place to live.

While luxury living is not inexpensive, the location close to Whole Foods, pool-gym-bbq amenities, new facilities, 24hr gated security, and fabulous property management make it all worth it. Each of these aspects makes Avalon Morrison one of the finest places to live!<//text><gmap_id>0x808fcb675b3bb5cb:0x46d9e666d98b8ec9</gmap_id>< Rating>

<review>It's been a joyful experience to reside at Avalon Morrison. The best part is that the community is managed by wonderful people who are forthcoming to help you anytime. Besides its safe and pleasant surroundings make it a great place to rejuvenate after an intense day at work or school or have a barbecue hang out.< /review>< pics>

My girlfriend and I have lived at Avalon Morrison Park for over a year now. This is a really great community and we've enjoyed awesome memories here. The pool, gym and community areas are maintained well. Natalie, Evaniece and the team are very friendly and always happy to help with any questions / inquiries. I would certainly recommend Avalon Morrison Park to friends and colleagues.</text>

<review>I absolutely love the community & the leasing staff is amazing! I'm glad I made the choice to move here. The staff and residents take pride in its property. The staff also really cares about their residents. I have never had any issues living here. There is a good mix of singles and family's and I always felt secure. Maintenance response is quick and their work is well done. We enjoy the pool area and fitness center.

I've lived here for 8 months. Ashley, Denise, Shaima have been a very attentive and helpful leasing office team. Their events create a welcoming sense of community which encourage residents to swing by the office and enjoy refreshments i.e. holiday hot chocolate, tacos, pie tasting today on Pi Day, etc!
Avalon Morrison Park follows up with emails regarding:
-Home delivery kits delivered to office instead of doorstep!
-Amazon locker packages
-Temporary parking permits
Areas to improve:
-No guest parking lot/garage (strict enforcement of towing)
-Sometimes residents can hear airport and train noise at late night or early morning</Text>

Overall, Avalon Morrison Park is pretty good. Walls are well insulated. Ceilings appear to not be well insulated. I can hear tenants above me. Walking is amplified and is extremely loud from the unit directly above me.

The staff members are really great. Super nice, timely, efficient.< /Review>

<time>1481905998680</time><rating>3< /rating><review>Updated Review:. 5 to 3 stars.

Pro: Clean and new. Good location. Good price. Transfer from other Avalon Community because of work transfer made transfer of lease free and super easy. Maintenance is quick to respond.

Cons:
They remove amenities. They no longer accept UPS or FedEx deliveries to office, even after saying they would prior to signing lease.  Double locked gates is a double edged sword as some delivery people give up stating they can't get in. Office response is to use Amazon locker. I feel sad having to leave a review like this as they are a great community for the most part. They say they listen, but without action listening is useless.<//review>< pics>

Been living here for the last two years, the staff is really helpful. One thing that stands out is the maintenance team, any issue with the apartment and they fix it the same day. I had a fire alarm beeping at 11 pm in the night and it was fixed within an hour, special thanks to Carlos for that!< /Text>

Just moved in about a week ago and love the community. Spotless apartment with a ton of space close to Caltrain - perfect! There were no carts to help move in but everything else during the move in process was great. There are some young folks who hang out in the club house area on the weekend pretty late and are kind of loud but that's the only time we hear people out there. The underground garage doors sometimes stay open when they should be closed - I recommend to Avalon to check that out because it allows random people to have access to the garage.< /Text>

<Review>What can I not mention about how great the Avalon team has treated us. My husband, cat and I have been living here for over 1 year. Within that year, we have enjoyed the wonderful amenities which are easily accessible and clean from the swimming pool, gym, bbq’s , fire pit and most recently we were able to reserve the community room for a special celebration. Natalie the office manager has worked with us from the day we moved in and made sure our special event was wonderfully accommodated. She is easy to work with and is very polite, patient and understanding. The maintenance crew is also very helpful especially Jimmy. He helped make our event memorable and what we envisioned by coming in and ensuring the room was mopped and cleaned for our guest and after the event he came back and helped put the room back together and helped us clean up. He went over and beyond what we expected. The Avalon staff is approachable and available as well as keep people accountable if they are not following the lease rules. This community has been impeccable for my husband, cat and I. Our family just wants to take a moment and say thank you to the professional staff for making us proud of where we live!</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fcb675b3bb5cb:0x46d9e666d98b8ec9</Gmap_id><time>1490724826612</time>< resp>

<Text>I have been living here for about 6 months now and I can say that I love it.  The office staff are very friendly and always are quick to answer any questions.  If I file a maintenance request or see something in the complex that needs cleaning I can grab one of the maintenance people like Jimmy and it'll be taken care of right away.  Staff like Rob always makes the weekends there pleasant with a wave and a hello as they are walking through and showing units.  They have lots of community get togethers that are fun and lets you meet your neighbors which only makes it better.  I spend most of my weekends swimming in the salt water pool and hanging with the nice people who live around me.  Honestly, the price is worth it for what you get in the area.  Plus the location is great for walking downtown or up the Alameda for food and drinks!</Text>< Resp>

We have been living here for over two months, and could not be more pleased with the facilities and the staff, especially Shaima Feroz! When we first moved in we indicated to her that we wanted a 3 bedroom, but none were available so she put us on a wait list and checked in with us once one was available. She consistently bends over backwards with an incredible eye towards the resident and prospective resident’s experience. I could not recommend working with her more, or experiencing and living at this Avalon community.

Thanks, Shaima!</Review>

<text>I have lived at the Avalon Morrison Park for couple months. Thus far it has proved to be a great community. Living in the downtown area for the last several year, Avalon Morrison Park has a perfect mix of urban living, cleanliness, and quiet. My neighbors all seem to be working professionals, so evenings and nights noise is respectful.It is in walking distance to Diridon Station, the SAP Center, and Whole Foods and a quick ride-share to central downtown. The staff is super friendly and engaging. I have a had a few minor issues, and the followup is always quick. The only issue that has been ongoing is with the remote fobs. They have had issues syncing them, so sometimes entering certain access points is challenging. Overall, I am happy living at Avalon Morrison Park.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Highly Recommend, One of the best apartment complexes in the south bay. Here is why:

1)The whole team (office as well as maintenance) are very professional, friendly and helpful, specially Ms. Shaima Firooz and Miguel Gill. They both provides prompt service and respond to your inquires very fast. And they do everything to help you. Very polite and super professional.

2)The location is great. Close to whole food, target, caltrain and trader joes. Highway access (87, 280, 880). Coffee shops and good restaurants.

3)Neighbors are all very nice and the neighborhood is safe.

I would have given 6 stars if it was an option. Specially for the staff.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1552334297513, 'text': 'Amirreza, we love that you are enjoying your time at Avalon Morrison Park!

Great Location
Great Staff
Great Residences

I must say I do enjoy living here and have been here for just over a year now. Can't been the proximity to down town including CalTrain & SAP Center, the gym is excellent and the staff is always there to help with a smile.

I will definitely be considering Avalon Communities when I do end up relocating.</review>

The leasing process was so quick, compared to living in San Francisco where its hard to even lease a single room. Rob and the rest of the staff are always helpful. They even came out to hold the gate open for me when I was moving stuff in by myself, what gentlemen!

We have only been here a month, but have noticed so many benefits to where we live--The gym, pool, and barbecue areas are awesome. The locations is perfect for any shopping or transportation we need and I feel safe and comfortable in the neighborhood. It amazes me how quiet it is here!!

We've been living in a townhome here for 18 months. Cleanliness is decent within the complex and most of what you request a fix for is dealt with within a day or two. It's a plus that most units have balconies or terraces. Good-sized, clean (and almost new) units. OK value for the money, but less so as rents increase year over year.

Good common spaces and amenities (pool could be a little warmer, but we're happy to have one). Rec room, gym and outdoor grill area are well-kept and clean. The staff are helpful when it comes to small tasks, but are somewhat unresponsive when it comes to issues like theft, complex cleanliness outside of the BBQ areas/clubhouse, and evident unit damages from faulty design + maintenance.

The little landscaping there is on site is well-kept, but for the area (and even the nearby Avalon on the Alameda) it is sorely lacking.< /Review>

<review>I'm surprised to see such high reviews for Avalon Morrison Park. I lived here for a year in 2015 when things were still relatively good, but there were still problems relating to ants, noise, people smoking on the balcony, my husband's bike got stolen right off my balcony (we lived on the second floor), struggling to find parking after 11pm, and the garage gate was often broken, which made me feel very unsafe. Apparently, it's a lot worst now. Check out yelp for more information.</review></record>

We're almost coming up on a year at Avalon and we love it here! I love our townhome floorplan and the location is extremely convenient in terms of shopping, entertainment/dining, and freeways. The management is awesome, with quick responses to any issues you may have. We worked with Miguel and Rob, and they are always so friendly, and aware of what's going on in the community and with their residents.  Maintenance response is also timely. We look forward to renewing our lease here!<//review>

Avalon you suck at Humanity...
Yes worst management I have ever seen. Rude people with no willingness to help in any service request.

You will come across at least two major issues each month like elevator will be broken, or water service will be out, or theft issues and so on...

On my moving date, elevator was not working. And this was for the second time in same week.
Now how could have I moved all my stuff from 3rd floor without elevator?

When I tried reaching office here is what they said:
It is not our problem. You can move stuff by stairs.

I said: I already ask my movers, but few things like couch are very heavy. They cannot move them.

Office: I don't believe it. May be you don't want to spend money and ask them to do extra work!

Really??? Is this the way you serve people who are paying more than $3K per month for your crappy place?
It's not about the money. It's about humanity. You cannot expect 2 poor people to move heavy stuff from 3rd floor.
They had already done 87 rounds up and down to move most of stuff, and I had to ask them to move couch and bed by stairs as well. I felt extremely bad for those folks.

Avalon you really suck at Humanity. It's not always about the money.
I will never recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

They charge you 3k rent per month and then at the time of move out they charge you with illogical penalties if you don't move to other avalon apartments. They want a commission in everything from cleaning to bedbug treatment. As I can see from other reviews they haven't improved one bit.</Text>

<review>We had an issue moving in. Urine stains were found all over the carpet and not suitable for move in. I would have expected this to be dealt with when the prior tenants moved out and Avalon had a week to turn the unit. This lack of attention to detail is somewhat a concern. We were willing to move into the suite in this condition and expected the carpet to be changed out within the next few days. Carpet removal and replacement occurred one week later. We were disappointed with the lack of communication from the leasing staff regarding the carpet removal/replacement schedule. It could have been handled more smoothly. I am surprised we weren't offered abated rent for our inconvenience.  UPDATE: One day after this posting we received abated rent for the period we had to live with the urine stained carpet. The rent credit was appreciated.</review>< pictures>

Avalon Morrison Park is a lovely place to live.  Centrally located to most major freeways but not close enough to hear any of the traffic noise. Great for using SJC airport if you are frequent traveler, less than a $10 Uber.

One of the other main reasons Avalon Morrison Park was such a great place to live was its excellent staff and management headed by its very own Natalie Stout.  They made you feel a part of their family and were always very attentive to each tenants needs.  Dealing with hundreds of tenants can be overwhelming but somehow they always made you feel as if your where there only one.

Another perk was the newly built Whole Foods Market just 1 block down.  However, inconvenient on your wallet it is great on your time and health.

The overall apartments and grounds are well built and well maintained.  The apartments themselves are nicely laid out and the space feels functional and spacious.< /Text>

Great location. It is close to a whole foods and several restaurants near the area. The Caltrain is within a 10-15 minute walk. San Pedro square is also very close.<//review>

<review>I just moved here a few weeks ago and love the community!  The people are nice, the location is convenient, and I feel really safe.  The staff is super-helpful also.  When my professional national movers could not figure out how to get my queen box spring upstairs to the bedroom aside from cutting it in half (seriously? ok, thanks for your input), Evaniece worked with me and my mom to get it upstairs.  It also wasn't that complicated if they had been motivated.  But thankfully, Evaniece, Amanda, and the rest of the front office staff are incredible and accommodating.  I could not be happier to be part of this community!!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

< Review>
Avalon Morrison Park is a great place to live. My wife and I have been residents for over a year and have no real complaints. Probably the best part about the community is the staff, and this seems to hold true for all of Avalon's properties (we've looked at a couple others and are always treated well!). For instance, Miguel will see us walking up from his desk inside the "fishbowl" leasing office and have our packages ready. He knows our names, apartment number, and even personal details that we've talked to him about. The cool thing is that this isn't the case just for us (even though I can't imagine that we're *not* his favorite residents), he knows everyone. There have been a couple others who have joined the team recently and they explicitly mentioned trying to get to know everyone. This is just a really great touch, and makes dealing with any issues super simple!

Some nitpicky things: the grills don't seem to be cleaned very often, trash is often overflowing at some of the public areas, and the pool heater seems to rarely be turned on (which was probably the most enticing amenity when we moved in).

As for maintenance, the team is awesome. We haven't really had a lot of issues (probably because the unit is brand new), but when we have, they're very responsive. We even put in a couple of requests for community things (i.e. timer for grills being shut off at the wrong time) and it was resolved the next day (after reporting it late at night).

The property itself is beautiful--lots of amenities, community happy hours, brand new gym, and cabanas by the pool. For San Jose, the location is great. It's close enough to walk to all of the downtown excitement (~1 mile to Santa Clara and First), but far enough that you're not in the middle of it all. The Alameda is becoming more built up, and best of all there's a brand new Whole Foods a 2 minute walk away (with a awesome bar!).

In closing, one of the best perks about living at an Avalon community is that they will let you transfer your lease to another property, even before your lease is up (with no charge as long as it's over 50 miles). If you're looking for a place to live, definitely put this one on your list of considerations.<//Review>

<text>We lived at AMP for about 2 years. The only reason we moved out was because I changed jobs in another city.

PLUSES:
+ Natalie and the staff are all SUPER nice and very responsive to problems. I think we only had 1 issue that wasn't solved in about 24 hours and it was because they had to order a part.
+ The apartments are all newly built and have great features.
+ SUPER dog friendly and there are a lot of dogs for your dog to play with
+ The outside grill areas are great for parties and met a lot of my neighbors that way

Minuses are few but I will list them.

MINUSES:
- expensive (Welcome to silicon valley)
- The city water is very "hard" and that makes your dishes and bathrooms "crusty". Also causes the water to be turned off every 2 months or so for "maintenance" which is really just descaling the pipes from buildup. Expect to go thru a lot of CLR
- They rent to college students who are pretty careless with their surroundings sometimes. Maintenance does a good job of keeping everything clean Monday thru Friday, but weekends can get a little trash-ridden.
- That part of the city has a lot of petty theft. The complex is no exception. The staff does a good job of using cameras to track down problem areas but assume anything not nailed down outside will get swiped.<//text>< user>

Since living here when the complex opened in 2014, I am afraid I have to submit my review of ONE star.
While the maintenance staff is awesome and always responsive, the overall feel of the property has gone down. Several break ins to cars and thefts of bikes make it feel more unsafe than before. There should be onsite security at all times since the break-ins and thefts began . We pay enough rent to support that. However, not much has happened to help secure the residents .
The office used to accept packages but no longer does. Packages are left in hallways which, with all the recent thefts, seems like a disaster waiting to happen. This was a poor decision and not in the best interests of the residents.
For the price of the rent we pay, which has gone up each year mind you, Avalon should be doing a lot better.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I was lucky enough to find out about Avalon Morrison Park after making the decision to leave City Gates Cupertino (formerly Archstone Cupertino), where my husband and I had lived for nearly four years.  A close friend had just moved into a 2 bedroom unit within the complex, so we decided to check it out - and I am so thrilled we did.  We were so impressed by the complex and the amenities that we signed our lease that day.  Where else can I walk 1 block to the new Whole Foods, or be a few blocks from the bars and restaurants on the Alameda.

Miguel and the rest of the Avalon Morrison Park team are amazing and go above and beyond to get to know every tenant and to make sure that everything about your new home is perfect.  I have lived in a lot of communities in my time, but I can honestly say they are the best staff that I have ever worked with.

The community is new, and feels more like an upscale hotel with the pool and cabanas, and a gym that is bigger and more updated than my old 24 Hour Fitness Super Sport, which allowed me to cancel that membership and save the monthly fee.

Check it out for yourself, and I challenge you to find a nicer property or more professional management staff in the South Bay.</text>< Pics>

Avalon at Morrison Park has been nothing but a great experience. This is my third time at an Apartment Community and it has been the best yet. The community its self is very nice and well kept. The gym, pool, bbq area, community room are very nice! Parking for residents is great. Parking for guests is somewhat difficult. The area is down the street from downtown entertainment, many grocery stores (target, CVS, Safeway, whole foods), and public transportation (Caltrain, Amtrak, Busses). The layout of the 2x2.5 homes are great, especially if you are living with a friend or coworker. What I enjoy most about Avalon at Morrison Park is the staff! Best staff hands down! Huge props to Miguel; he's great and very helpful...BEST COMMUNITY SUPERVISOR! I can always count on him and the rest of the staff. The community manager herself is wonderful as well. Maintenance is very prompt and friendly. In addition to their superior customer service, they know how to host great community events to bring the residents together. Thanks Avalon at Morrison Park for continuing to provide a great place to live!<//Text>

<Name>Nikita Merchant<//Name><date>1510519395576<//date><rate>1</rate><review>We gave this community 5 stars before but after experiencing racist attitude towards Indians, its time to change it!

Here is my current review.

We loved staying at Avalon and have called this our home for close to 3 years and only had good things to say about the community, the  leasing and maintenance staff. (check our previous review). However, ever since the leasing staff has changed late last year, our experience has only gone downhill.
Every community has problems and issues, not denying the fact but we measure it in the manner in which the staff manages it to resolution.
Evanice, the leasing agent is the most difficult agent to talk to as she has always been rude, discourteous and impolite. Talk to her about any problem and there goes her attitude as if the fault lies with us. In talking with others in the community, we have to come to know that she exhibits this behaviour and attitude towards Indians. We are suprised by her racist attitude towards Indians and more surprised that Avalon have her on their payroll. Check other reviews below by Indians in the recent past.
It is impossible to go to her with a problem and expect to resolve it. She needs some customer service training in managing good customer relations across all cultures.
*********************My Previous review*********************************
Avalon Morrison Park is a beautiful place to live , its conveniently located close to Caltrain, VTA, shopping, groceries and schools!

We lived here for 2 years now (we initially were suppose to live only for a year) but we decided to continue the  next year not only because of the convenience but also because of the best staff they have Natelie, Rob and Miguel. They make lot of efforts to make sure everything is ok ! The Maintenance team here is absolutely prompt in handling any Maintenance issues there is, in the apartment, within 24 hours!

The team is absolutely proactive and responsive in case of any emergency situation!

A special shout to Natalie to help us extend our lease for couple of weeks more after we gave our 30 day notice and we still were not ready for a move out! Thank you!

Thank you for this place that we call HOME :)< /review>< pics>

I'm a long term resident, having moved into the complex a little shy of 3 years ago when people first started moving in. I'm now on my 3rd lease, and thought I'd check in and see if my review still fit - and it does. Below are the sentiments I wrote a while back, and they are still 100% accurate:

I'm lucky to call myself one of the first residents to move into the community - and I must say that I love living here. The staff is super friendly, and when I've had any problems they've done everything within their power to make it right and make sure I'm left smiling.

The location is optimum. Only a few blocks to the CalTrain station - to the SAP Center (go Sharks!) - and with Whole Foods practically next door, it's a quick run if you forget the oregano. The amenities are awesome, too - onsite Gym, and several available BBQ's for an outdoor dining experience.<//review>

<text>I have been living at Avalon Morison Park for over a year and I love it here.

It is conveniently located, having quick access to pretty much all you need on a daily basis as well as being close to Downtown San Jose, the Caltrain Station and San Jose airport. Around the community there are also several stores and restaurants like WholeFoods, CVS, Chipotle, UPS and Starbucks.

Everyone that works here is super friendly, helpful and efficient. The maintenance staff is very quick to solve any problem there might be, which from my experience haven't been a lot due to how recent the apartments are. Natalie, Miguel and Rob at the leasing office are always welcoming and they know everyone by name and make sure that everything is perfect.

I think what really sold us on Avalon Morrison Park was how well received we were and the immediate feeling of community. We had Miguel show us the house and he sure made the decision easier.

I recommend seeing it for yourself. It is a great place to live!< /text>< Pictures>

Tucked in the corner of this center Hugo's Deli is a welcome and delicious eatery.
Nice sandwich selection, featuring Boar's Head meats, on the menu, a deep collection of Deep River chips, with a standard and alternative drink options.
The sandwich proportions and price are on point for lunch or dinner.< /text>

<review>I am not from the area but when I am around I keep coming back. The owner is super friendly and makes you feel very comfortable. The place is very clean and the food is great at reasonable prices.

I will keep coming back when I am in Torrance.<//review><Date>1411325885247<//Date><user_id>113080018745346133534<//user_id><user_name>Gadi Glogowski<//user_name><Rate>5<//Rate><Gmap_id>0x80c2b52aabbfc6d5:0x6d89dba9a25d5dd0</Gmap_id></record>

Great food and they're quick

so far Ive tried the infinity wrap, tritip, and turkey harvarti panini.

Turkey harvarti panini is bomb💣
Tritip is bomb
Infiniti wrap was ok 👌

Have come here TWICE and the credit card machine wasn't working. The guy let a customer come back with cash later but too bad for anyone else who hadn't been able to put in an order after waiting for 5 mins.<//Review>

I Called on the phone and had such a great experience that I had to give a review.  I called and spoke with a real helpful and friendly lady named Diana. I was calling to see if they can overnight something with a po box, the answer is no, but Diana went above and beyond even though she didn't have to help me.  She gave me some suggestions and even looked up some places up for me that I asked for, all while being friendly. Just want to say how nice it is to deal with a person who goes beyond common COURTESY;  because,  even common courtesy is not so common today, and dealing with two previous shipping stores that had misinformed me, less than helpful and less than friendly.<//review>

<user_name>Francis Asuncion</user_name><date>1621366346609< /date><rating>1</rating><review>I usually take my Amazon returns to this location. Just made an Amazon return 30 mins ago. It was supposed to be a no-cost and hassle free return. Today's visit was a complete disappointment. The staff was very condescending in telling me that I had to bring a box for my return and that I had print out the label. The staff showed frustration telling me that I didn't know what I was doing and that the location do not take returns without packaging.

I've returned many Amazon items to this specific location in the past with just my phone using provided bar code. Not only the staff's behavior was inexcusable, this location found a way to cost me money for a free Amazon return. I don't recommend doing business with this UPS store.</review>< pics>

< review>
I've used this store before with no issues at all what so ever. My last time was absolutely horrible!

I tried to send a package internationally in May. Shipping was shy over $150. It went a town over, and ended up getting delivered to my house, a month later, with no information given. I gave the UPS store a call to get information. They had no info. The best they could do is make a claim for a refund. They told me that this takes at least 30 days to investigate.

A month of no word, I give them a call. Still investigating. 3 months go by. The manager of the ups escalates it and should receive an update in 5 business days. I call a week later, still no update. I wait another month. Nothing.

About two weeks ago, I finally managed to get an update. My claim was closed a month ago, and done with. No refund. UPS associate told me to email my number over, and that they would forward it to the owner to give me a call.

It's been nearly 3 weeks since. No call. No resolution. I would strongly avoid this place. Multiple occasions they have hung up on me after having put me on hold for 20-30 minutes.</review>

<Review>Been using them for a few years and we've had many problems over that time. There used to be one nice staff women but she's gone now and its just a bad experience every time. Rude staff, expensive hidden costs, rule changes without notice, with holding mail....the list goes on and on. If you have the option to go somewhere else you'd be better off.<//Review>< Pics>

I read some of these reviews and they were just stupid and didn't apply to the store and customer service in my opinion. They are nice here and I'll keep going for all of my packages because of the accuracy and late pick up time.< /Review>< pictures>

Today this very nice young lady at the front (Norma) assisted me in packaging my mother's birthday present. She took her time and made sure everything was secure and neatly packaged. When she had questions of her own,her store lead Solange stepped in and assisted her with completing my service. Everyone within this establishment was very professional. They greeted everyone who walked in the door right away. Almost every staff member ask if I was being helped. I would recommend and return I this facility.

Side note there were 4 employees working today.  And there was a fragrant  within the store that smelt also sweet.</review>

I Called the store to inquire about their Live Scan service.  They were unable to provide any useful information including an estimation range on how much it costs.  They recommended to call back when the "Live Scan lady" was in.  I called back and they informed me that the Live Scan machine was unavailable and that I should take my business at their Clinton Keith location. I was a bit amazed at how clueless the working staff was in regards to providing information on their services, in addition to their lackluster in helping me.  I will not be going back to this location.<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>I shipped a package through their store with a next morning delivery option. the package got out on time, but Ups corporate failed to get the package on the airplane.
The real problem is when I went into the store the next morning they said I was going to get a full refund. They took my name, number, and tracking number. They said we cannot process your claim until the package arrives tomorrow and they would call me to let me know the claim has been processed. Then I would need to wait 7 to 10 days for a check to be made out.  I failed to receive a call from them  regarding my claim and they are only open for another 3 hours. I called  and they knew nothing about my claim and gathered all my information again and said they would call me in 7 to 10 days when my check arrived. I doubt they will!<//review>< gmapID>

< Review>
at 3 in the afternoon i went in to mail a package and a certified letter. I have everything filled out and affixed. The guy at the register was new, so no big deal he didn't know what a certified was. There were 2 other emp. there, but he had to ask for help a few times. Finally he gives me the green part back and I ask for it to be date stamped. call again for help 2x, and the woman comes up and says "oh we don't do that" wth!  then she tops it with "it doesn't make any difference, the mail has already been picked up today, so it isn't going out until tomorrow" and walks away. what great customer service (sarcasm here).< /Review>

<text>Store manager,  Darian refused to help me and refused let me speak to store owner to resolve this matter.
Darian told  me he would not even leave my number so store owner could contact me personally.
I asked when is the store owner in store, and Dairan said,  "when he is" and would not give me any specific information.

Even after I contacted UPS customer service and spoke to a supervisor who was willing to issue me a refund, and who I had physically on the phone when I conferenced called this local store. The UPS supervisor said the money goes to the local store on an invoice and then the local store refunds the money to me. Darian still refused to forward there refunded  money to me even if ups authorized it.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< time>

I Called on the phone and had such a great experience that I had to give a review.  I called and spoke with a real helpful and friendly lady named Diana. I was calling to see if they can overnight something with a po box, the answer is no, but Diana went above and beyond even though she didn't have to help me.  She gave me some suggestions and even looked up some places up for me that I asked for, all while being friendly. Just want to say how nice it is to deal with a person who goes beyond common COURTESY;  because,  even common courtesy is not so common today, and dealing with two previous shipping stores that had misinformed me, less than helpful and less than friendly.< /Review>

I usually take my Amazon returns to this location. Just made an Amazon return 30 mins ago. It was supposed to be a no-cost and hassle free return. Today's visit was a complete disappointment. The staff was very condescending in telling me that I had to bring a box for my return and that I had print out the label. The staff showed frustration telling me that I didn't know what I was doing and that the location do not take returns without packaging.

I've returned many Amazon items to this specific location in the past with just my phone using provided bar code. Not only the staff's behavior was inexcusable, this location found a way to cost me money for a free Amazon return. I don't recommend doing business with this UPS store.</Text>

I've used this store before with no issues at all what so ever. My last time was absolutely horrible!

I tried to send a package internationally in May. Shipping was shy over $150. It went a town over, and ended up getting delivered to my house, a month later, with no information given. I gave the UPS store a call to get information. They had no info. The best they could do is make a claim for a refund. They told me that this takes at least 30 days to investigate.

A month of no word, I give them a call. Still investigating. 3 months go by. The manager of the ups escalates it and should receive an update in 5 business days. I call a week later, still no update. I wait another month. Nothing.

About two weeks ago, I finally managed to get an update. My claim was closed a month ago, and done with. No refund. UPS associate told me to email my number over, and that they would forward it to the owner to give me a call.

It's been nearly 3 weeks since. No call. No resolution. I would strongly avoid this place. Multiple occasions they have hung up on me after having put me on hold for 20-30 minutes.</Text>

Been using them for a few years and we've had many problems over that time. There used to be one nice staff women but she's gone now and its just a bad experience every time. Rude staff, expensive hidden costs, rule changes without notice, with holding mail....the list goes on and on. If you have the option to go somewhere else you'd be better off.<//text>

I now use this store over all the other local options because this is the last store UPS comes to pick up the packages, so you can get there later (about 5 p.m. but get there by 4:30 p.m.) and the other stores are 3 p.m. There is always someone at the desk and you don't wait long. I read some of these reviews and they were just stupid and didn't apply to the store and customer service in my opinion. They are nice here and I'll keep going for all of my packages because of the accuracy and late pick up time.< /text>

I Called the store to inquire about their Live Scan service.  They were unable to provide any useful information including an estimation range on how much it costs.  They recommended to call back when the "Live Scan lady" was in.  I called back and they informed me that the Live Scan machine was unavailable and that I should take my business at their Clinton Keith location. I was a bit amazed at how clueless the working staff was in regards to providing information on their services, in addition to their lackluster in helping me.  I will not be going back to this location.<//text>

<Text>I shipped a package through their store with a next morning delivery option. the package got out on time, but Ups corporate failed to get the package on the airplane.
The real problem is when I went into the store the next morning they said I was going to get a full refund. They took my name, number, and tracking number. They said we cannot process your claim until the package arrives tomorrow and they would call me to let me know the claim has been processed. Then I would need to wait 7 to 10 days for a check to be made out.  I failed to receive a call from them  regarding my claim and they are only open for another 3 hours. I called  and they knew nothing about my claim and gathered all my information again and said they would call me in 7 to 10 days when my check arrived.

The older lady helping me was so crass and sarcastic, I just figured she hated working there at her age, turns out she was the owner! There are plenty of other of these places to choose from, I will never go here again!< /Text>

at 3 in the afternoon i went in to mail a package and a certified letter. I have everything filled out and affixed. The guy at the register was new, so no big deal he didn't know what a certified was. There were 2 other emp. there, but he had to ask for help a few times. Finally he gives me the green part back and I ask for it to be date stamped. call again for help 2x, and the woman comes up and says "oh we don't do that" wth!  then she tops it with "it doesn't make any difference, the mail has already been picked up today, so it isn't going out until tomorrow" and walks away. what great customer service (sarcasm here).<//Text>

Store manager,  Darian refused to help me and refused let me speak to store owner to resolve this matter.
Darian told  me he would not even leave my number so store owner could contact me personally.
I asked when is the store owner in store, and Dairan said,  "when he is" and would not give me any specific information.

Even after I contacted UPS customer service and spoke to a supervisor who was willing to issue me a refund, and who I had physically on the phone when I conferenced called this local store. The UPS supervisor said the money goes to the local store on an invoice and then the local store refunds the money to me. Darian still refused to forward there refunded  money to me even if ups authorized it.<//text>

<text>I have had a great experience with the dentist at Select Dental Group & Orthodontics. Everyone is so friendly and knowledgable which has helped ease my anxiety about going to the dentist. I have had many bad experiences with going to the dentist in the past but Dr. Gangel, Dr. Besser, & Dr. Brandon and the other dental hygenist have made me feel comfortable and taken care of. I appreciate their expertise and their friendliness has made me feel comfortable about going to the dentist & doing my regular check ups.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd4ab6477bae15:0xcccfa73426f15417<//gmapID><Date>1625721939274</Date>< UserId.>

< Review>
This Dental office and its staff are outstanding! In the confusing universe of LA Dentistry and the expensive billing practices that often encircle it...This office provides patient care first, detailed review of services and realistic fees. This was my first visit to this office and I will remain a patient, In-depth RC and crown treatment were provided with the utmost care and concern for my discomfort and pain.

This review shall act as an accurate review of my visit in Feb 2021, foregoing my above expectations were met and the patient care was thorough and comforting. I highly recommend this dental practice, and it's combined staff and physicians.< /Review>

My experience is always a positive one! From the kind front office staff, to the gentle and accommodating Kelsey the hygienist, to Quynh who always makes sure that things run smoothly. Cumulatively, my family has been treated by just about every specialty in the office, and we are grateful to be able to have all of our dental needs met by a collaborative staff under one roof. Dr Brandon and his team who gave my children excellent orthodontic care, Dr Salo and Dr Gangel who have given us excellent dental care, and Dr Alonzo who safely performed tooth extractions and wisdom teeth removal on my children. The office is very pleasant, clean and organized, and we appreciate it!</Text>

I'm taking my business somewhere else.
Very Disappointed with the lady at the front desk that helped me when I was leaving yesterday, I asked her if my insurance would cover my fluoride treatment and she responded "is $45.00 sir" I handed her my debit card and I entered my pin code to pay, she demanded that I sign a paper that clearly said " no signature required" she insisted that I sign and just said "just sign sir" I refused to sign, she called me rude and referred me to her manager, the manager agreed that I didn't need to sign. Her attitude was as if I was bothering her. She doesn't appreciate my business and because of her I'm taking my business somewhere else</text>

i would recommend this office wholeheartedly.  My issues with my teeth were extensive, I had pain and sensitivity as well as periodontal disease.
Dr Solis and his staff are professional and made me feel at ease.
They worked with me to find an affordable way to pay, so it was less stressful.
The work done was excellent, and there was minimal, discomfort during the procedures, or afterwards.< /review>

As one who has had horrible experiences at the dentist previously I have finally found a group of dentists I am comfortable with and trust. I have seen several of their dentists and each has always given me their full attention explaining what they're doing and have done their best not to cause pain. I've had two emergencies and they got me in as soon as i could get there. If you are looking for a dentist try the Select Dental Group in Torrance.< /review>

Ruby is an excellent hygienist. She identified that my puffy gums was a side effect of my medication. I was able to get the doctor to change it and avoid many hours at the dentist. Dr. Salo and his staff treat me like family. I won't go to any other dentist.< /Text>

<text>Dr. Salo, the team and the facilities at Select Dental were first class. They took the time to explain even the smallest of details on my x-rays and I left feeling confident in my overall Dental health. My hygienist had the softest touch with her hands and now I look forward to going to the dentist!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

TOP NOTCH DENTAL GROUP!

The entire staff at this office is great and very professional. The ladies at the front desk always so welcoming.

Ines (Dental hygienists) is always so gentle and caring, she makes sure you are comfortable while doing her job.

Vanessa (Office manager) is easy to work with and offers excellent! customer service with a smile.

Dr. Brandon (Orthodontist) has a lot of patience. At the initial consultation he thoroughly explained the procedures, answered all our questions and concerns. During installation, he made sure he explained the process step by step to my son. He made my son feel comfortable, thank you Dr. Brandon.

No doubt in my mind this is the best dental group I’ve been to, I highly recommend them.< /review>

Quinn the office manager is by far one of the rudest people I have ever spoken too. She had an immediate attitude with you and has no idea how to give proper customer service. Only after asking if I could speak to a manager to which she replied with attitude I am the office manager, so I asked for a supervisor and only THEN did her tone and demeanor change. She states she has no idea when her Regional supervisor will call me back. But this is not the first time she has given my husband and I issues. Back in March in trying to figure out the best care plan for my husband it was the same thing. Maybe because we don’t have PPO insurance or maybe because we are not white that she treats us so disrespectfully. I do not understand how someone like that could be the office manager.  I would NOT recommend coming to this facility. Stay away because Quinn will completely ruin your experience. Go somewhere else where customer service and patient care is important. And they don’t have some horrible bad attitude woman taking calls and helping patients. Totally unacceptable.< /Text>

I googled local dentist in Torrance and found Select Dental Group. When I first walked in I was amazed on how nice and new the facility was. I can't remember the nurses (assistants) name that did my x-rays but she was extremely nice. The doctor that examined my teeth was very helpful. She showed me all the x-rays, pictures of my teeth and gums. She actually explained to me what was going on in my mouth and what I needed to get done so my teeth could be healthy again. I was very confidant going to Select Dental Group so I actually made three appointments to come back to get the work that's needed for my teeth. I really wish I would of remembered each persons name because each and every one of the ladies were extremely nice to me and I'm very happy I found this place. Can't wait to see you ladies again on Wednesday.</Review><response>{'time': 1497913611157, 'text': 'Imani,\non behalf of the entire practice we would like to extend a warm welcome.

I came to Select Dental years ago for a second opinion. Not only did they confirm the issues caused by corrosion of old fillings but they showed me with a camera. The fix was to replace the fillings with new crowns for most of my molars.

From there Dr. Salo also noticed that my bite was poor and came up with a plan to correct my bite while doing the crowns by carefully extending the lengths of each tooth so that when finished, the teeth were touching perfectly when I bite.

Today, I have a bite that feels great. My teeth look great. I have been able to receive the best  dental care for all my unique situations.

The office is clean, the staff is excellent, the Doctors are hands down the best in their field. And they have a lot of great tech.

I've had more than my fair share of toothaches and they have always been able to take care of the problem and restore my smile.<//text>

< Review>
When we moved to Torrance 16 years ago we checked out a couple of dentist offices. Another practice was interested in performing lots of dental work that was not covered by our insurance. Select Dental works with our insurance to provide the best care, and takes the time to explain the reasons for any procedure that goes beyond our coverage.

The dentists and hygienists all do an excellent job and have a great "chair-side manner." The front desk is friendly and efficient. Since they deal with most every type of insurance be sure you have a basic idea of what insurance you have and how it works. Give 'em a hand and they'll do right by you.

The team at Select Dental had been fighting their old office building for years. Recently they move a couple blocks down the street to what is basically a new facility. Very high tech, and now they have decent parking, too!

Dad, mom, the kids and even grandma go to Select Dental for our orthodontic and dentistry needs.</Review>

I no longer dread my dental appointments since I started coming to Select Dental. The doctors are patient and informative and the assistants are very friendly and professional unlike other places I've gone to before. I am also very appreciative of the girls in the front Who verified my benefits and thoroughly explained how my insurance works.

Highly recommend too all !.<//Text>

Each staff member takes their time with you to make sure you are getting the absolute best of care. Dr. Gangel and Dr. Besser performed my root canal and filling. They are great at what they do as they took time to explain what she is doing and before what is happening. Loved to be knowing what is going on.

If I could give this dental practice 10 stars I would.! I have been coming here for years, frequently over the last 2 yrs for issues that have now been resolved. All of the dentists I have been treated by, Dr. Salo, Dr. Gangel, Dr. Brandon, Dr. Lau. are all very knowledgeable, and professional especially Dr. Salo.  (Very compassionate also).  Dr. Salo's assistants Hector and Lisa are the best, they explain everything you need to know, and are very knowledgeable and kind!
The office staff especially Quinn are all courteous and professional.  Quinn is always there to answer any questions and to offer support if you need it.  I would highly recommend this dental practice.</review>

If I could I would give this group 100 x more. Just went through 3 hours of oral surgery (bone graphing) and I was awake through the whole process. Dr. Salo and his team are AMAZING. The care and patience this team expressed to keep me comfortable throughout the 3 hours kept me calm and helped me get through the surgery. Dr. Salo has performed 2 surgeries on me... and after most oral surgeries people experience pain, swelling possibly some bruising... I can honestly say... I have had very minimal pain and swelling and so far no signs of bruising... Thank you Dr. Salo and many thanks to the whole team, you’re AWESOME !! ❤️</text>

Not sure how this place has so many high ratings, I’m assuming they’re fake or paid promos. Anywho, the office staff and office manager are very rude. Once I reported the issue to the office manager, they used the excuse “well we’re short staffed” like it’s the patient’s fault. They also gave me the ultimatum, “well do you want to keep your appointment, or not”. Horrible customer service. I will not be scheduling any future appointments with this entity if this is the kind of customer service I have to look forward to,<//Review>

You will not be disappointed.
1 stop shop for cosmetic dental work, oral surgery, implants, even orthodontics (for young and old).
Very accommodating with scheduling and emergencies as well...I travel a lot, they never fail to work with my sometimes short unscheduled layovers. Reasonable rates (cash discount) for high quality work!

<Text>I have been going to Select Dental Group and Orthodontics (formerly Downtown Family Dental) for the past 6  years and would highly recommend them due to their friendly,  professional and accommodating services.
Being in the customer service business myself, I am very conscious and aware of customer service. I can honestly say that I have not one complaint on any of the staff’s customer service skills. And during the past 6 years, I have interacted with the majority of the employees -  the front desk staff,  dental  and orthodontic  technicians,  hygienists, dentists, orthodontist,  endodontist and office manager-and they are all consistently helpful and are genuinely friendly individuals of whom I have complete trust in their professional services.<//Text><date>1447050644081</date><rating>5</rating><resp>None< /resp>< user_name>

I’m fairly new to this dental office, but so happy to be here. I love it. The staff is super friendly and always remember a patient’s name, starting with Gigi and the whole front staff. They are so awesome! Great customer service. Quynh makes your visit so easy. She helps with questions and concerns I have. Ruby is amazing. She is so patient, informative, and makes me feel so at home during my cleanings. Use to hate the dentist office, but not anymore, thank you to Select Dental. Highly recommend them!!< /Text>

I was suffering from mouth pain. And after informing me that I had to get my wisdom teeth removed, they were able to book me two days later.

They were able to give me a good rate despite my lack of dental issuance, and they were very hospitable.< /review>

My fiancé and Mother in law have had plenty of bad experiences at different dental groups, until a good friend recommended SELECT DENTAL GROUP & ORTHODONTICS. They are very pleased with the work they performed on them and the staff is just amazing. Make you feel comfortable and its not intimidating. They will talk to you about the procedures and what needs to be done. Very please with everyone we have recommended several of our family and friends to this location due to the great quality, professionalism, bilingual staff ,and patient care.
Thank you<//review>

My initial visit to Select Dental Group (SDG) was a bit rocky. There was some miscommunication between the front office and the dentist. However, after airing out my frustration, everything was remedied and they have become my favorite dental office. Dr. G and her staff are super gentle and personable. The office is super clean and they use state of the art equipment and techniques. My niece, who normally screams and holler, loves this dentist and the office; and has no problem attending her appointments.  Give them a try. You will not be disappointed.<//review>

<review>I get my Dental and Orthodontic work done here, and I drive over an hour to come to do so. That right there should tell you how amazing this place is. The staff is super friendly and the cleanliness of the facility is amazing. I used to hate going to the Dentist but I don't anymore. The Office Manager Vanessa is constantly checking on everyone and really makes an effort to make every patient feel special. She even personally called me the day after I got my Invisalign just to make sure everything was ok and asked me if I had any questions. I haven't been to many places where the Office Manager finds the time to take this extra step, but somehow she does it. I will continue to come to Select Dental & Orthodontics and you should also!</review><gmap_id>0x80dd4ab6477bae15:0xcccfa73426f15417< /gmap_id><time>1534463102512< /time></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I was recently referred to Select Dental and I am 100% happy with my experience.  The doctors are professional, friendly, and most importantly - extremely knowledgeable about their work.  The clinic is beautiful and clean.  There's usually an army of lovely ladies at the front desk so making an appointment is never a hassle.

I started my Invisalign treatment 5 weeks ago and it has been such a great experience.  I have postponed getting Invisalign for years, but Quynh inspired me with her perfect smile.  She also set up a super convenient and affordable payment plan for me.  Quynh is a big part of the wonderful environment at Select Dental, she is truly caring and have been very helpful along the way.

Look no further!  I highly recommend Select Dental Group & Orthodontics.<//Review>

This was an amazing day. My grandson was so terrified and crying we thought the treatment may have to be postponed. He left laughing! I said we have to come back for one more cavity. He said "yaaay!" Im still in awe of the professional and caring way he was handled. Thanks so much!

I like the doctor. I like the staff. I am a grumpy person and they have made my day with the smiles I get when I walked in the door.  I highly recommend. And by the way. They have a new hygienist. She was  excellent.  Although my regular hygienist what on an a extended appointment.  I felt just as comfortable. Well she help with that.< /Text>

<text>I'm very satisfied with Select Dental Group. My hygienist really listens to my concerns and knows how to treat my sensitive teeth. I've had ortho work done and the staff is very knowledgeable and ready to help move you through the process. The dentist are great as well and have not done any test that were not necessary.

<Review>Terrible customer service from the billing person.   The last 2 times I was there she started an argument with me over my treatment plans.   Very rude.  Another customer was getting their x-ray copies and going to a new dentist while I was waiting...
I don't blame them.   I will never return to this place unless they fire that woman.  I've never been treated so bad in my life.< /Review>< name>

I've been going to Dr Salo for many many many years. He treats you like you're part of the family. He is a genius when it comes to dental work. And may I add handsome. That makes a differance when someone is in your mouth.
Honestly the best.</Text>

<Review>I had a wonderful experience.   I had broke my old front bridge and was terrified.   Dentist and staff here took excellent care of me, they made me a great looking temporary bridge right away and within weeks had my smile fixed.  My front teeth never looked better.  The office is very modern, clean and high tech. I am extremely greatful.< /Review>< Name>

Where to begin? Back in 2016 my husband and I were referred to Dr. Salo at the Torrance office by our dear friends who knew we were looking for an ethical, professional dental office who could provide long term care since our move from the Midwest to the LA area. We were very impressed during our first visits with Dr. Salo, Vanessa the Office Manager, and the rest of the staff. As healthcare professionals ourselves, we were also impressed with the office’s amenities, cleanliness, and technology. This dental group has clearly spared no expense in having the best technology and treatment options for their patients. They really care about long term care, not just quick fixes. Dr. Gangel has also seen both of us for general dental needs and she is highly experienced and knowledgeable as well. We drive all the way from Corona out in Riverside County to Torrance for dental care and treatment here, and we will continue to do so for as long as we live in California. I would highly recommend this Dental group to anyone looking for a full service dental home.</text>

My daughter is a patient, of orthodontist, Dr. Brandon.  He has a lot of patience.  During our initial consultation, he thoroughly explained the procedures.  She is half way through her treatment and I can already see a lot of improvement. During her monthly check ups, Dr. Brandon is always there to answer any questions.

Vanessa, the office manager is great as well.  She took the time to explain all the economics involving my daughter’s braces.  She is extremely easy to work with and provided many options.  She really took the time to make sure, I understood the procedure and costs.   She was there to answer all insurance questions.  She is always very friendly and there to offer a helping hand.

My husband and me see Dr. Gangel.  We absolutely love her.  She is the nicest person.  She also explains all the procedures.  She takes the time to make sure you are comfortable and makes sure we have a pleasant experience.   She listens to all of our concerns, and answers all questions and offers varies options.   I have seen many dentists in my lifetime.  No one will ever be close to Dr. Gangel.

The office is very clean and well kept.  There is little to no wait time.  The staff is always friendly with a big smile on their faces.  The front desk staff is always there to greet you.  I highly recommend this office.  From the minute you walk into their office to till the end of your visit you will always have a good experience.< /text><user_id>111141633957390200429</user_id></record>

<Review>Dr. Salo is an excellent dentist.  He doesn't recommend any unnecessary dental procedures.  He has saved many of my teeth over the years.  I just had two important crowns replaced and the results are great.  Dr. Gangel is also an excellent dentist.  The Select Dental dental staff is professional and helpful, and the office staff as well.  Select Dental is highly recommended.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Update: 10/16/2019

Please review your invoice when given to you by their employee, Quyh!  This was the first time I dealt with her and I am very upset with how she tried to over-charge me on my invoice. She had to change the invoice THREE times! And to top it off, she had a nasty attitude. She even rolled her eyes! She has no people skills, at all!
I'm not sure if she was having a bad day but because of her, I will no longer refer people to Select Dental.

I was referred to Select Dental in Torrance by my colleague and I’m glad I took her recommendation.

It started with an easy process of scheduling an appointment, which Vanessa, kindly assisted me via phone.

My  experience with Dr Gangel and her assistants, Sosanna and Connie was wonderful!

My 5 year old also enjoyed their service. He expressed to me how the dentist place was “fun.”

While in the process of having work done on my teeth, Dr Gangel kept asking me how I was doing. That defiantly showed me that she cares for her patients. She took the time to explain the process she would be performing on my teeth and calmly answered all my questions. She is very polite and professional!

I’m proud to recommend Dr Gangel and her team for your next dentist visit!<//Review>< rate>

< review>
I've always been a little hesitant coming to see the dentist. About two years ago I decided it was time to get my dental hygiene in order. I scheduled an appointment and was very pleased with the customer service. Dr. Salo walked me through every step of the way of what I needed to get my hygiene back in order. He was very informative and friendly and I felt no pressure. Matter of fact, I felt like I was talking with a good friend. I left the office very confident. Two years later I am a loyal patron. The new offices are simply amazing, very clean, organized, and friendly. I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a top notch dental office in the Southbay. Cheers!</review>

<Text>I found this dental office through through the Principal insurance website. When I arrived to this office I thought it was clean and checked in at 1:40. Prior to my arrival, I called this office to ensure that my insurance would cover the visit and that my wisdom tooth extraction would also be covered. I kept asking for the pricing prior to my arrival however they told me that insurance would be covering it. They insured me that it would and to "just come in." So that's what I did, I came in with my dad, because they told me that I would be sedated the day of, didn't eat past 4am, and followed all instructions. KEEP IN MIND, WHEN YOU COME YOU WILL BE HERE FOR HOURS, NOTHING WILL BE DONE FOR 2-3 HOURS. I had an appointment at 2PM, I didn't leave until 4:40PM. All I had done was the consultation and an X-Ray. Also, I did have to speak to the nurse and express to her how irritated I was that I was waiting for someone to come and consult me for 2 hours. That is ridiculous. I have someone waiting for me in the waiting room, only to have them wait 2 hours for no reason? After the consultation with the dentist, they showed me the cost of my treatment plan and it was nearly over a thousand dollars. WITH INSURANCE COVERING 90% OF THE COSTS. Yeah I left. I ran for the door because if insurance is covering 90% of the costs, my bill should not be that high for 2 wisdom tooth extractions.< /Text>< Pics>

Everyone at this office is so friendly and helpful.  Dr. Salo & the team did my implant.  It was a scary thing for me and the team did an excellent job taking care of me and keeping the pain to a minimum.  I also had a situation pop up almost over the weekend and it turned out by Monday I needed a root canal.  Dr. Gangle was able to see me that same day to take steps to alleviate the pain and did my root canal a few days after.  I love my hygienist Inez also!<//text>

Select Dental Group is a fantastic place to go for high quality dental care and customer servive. The staff there treats me like family. I actually hated going to the dentist due to some previous bad experiences. Dr. Salo and his team have completely turned me around so that going to the dentist is not a chore. Vanessa, the office manager, and Quyn are expecially helpful managing insurance benefits to make payment as easy as possible. If you have to go to the dentist this is the one to go to!</Text>

<Review>This office is the real deal. They really care about me and my experience with them. I originally called because I was in pain.  I was terrified to go to the dentist and I had waited so long I caused myself some major problems.  Once they found out I was in pain they got me in the office right away.  Dr. Salo and Besser are amazing. They spent time saving my tooth, where most other dentist would have just pulled it.

The office manager sat down with me and went over all my options so I can chose what works best for me.  The entire staff is friendly and the office is state-of-the-art, so they are not sending me other places to complete my treatments.

I can’t say enough about how great this dentist office is.  I am sharing them with all my family, friends and coworkers.  I am 47 years old and I use to be afraid of the dentist.  Not anymore, thank you Select Dental Group!!</Review><gmapID>0x80dd4ab6477bae15:0xcccfa73426f15417</gmapID><Rate>5<//Rate>< response>

I've had bad experiences before with other dentists where it's been painful and nerve wrecking that have made every experience a painful one. I've been seeing Dr. Gangel for some time now and she is the most professional, understanding and caring person I've ever encountered at a dentist. Dr. Gangel is aware of my past experiences and always makes sure to ask if I'm in any pain or if I'm doing ok...it sure makes me feel good knowing she cares. She had done an excellent job on the work she's done on me and I've never been happier.

I've also seen Ines, who's a hygienist at this office. Ines is a true professional, always so pleasant to see and makes sure to make me feel comfortable while doing her job. Always asking the right questions in regards to anything I may have a concern with.

I've also brought my two boys to this office. Here we also met Dr. Brandon who is the orthodontist at this office. Dr. Brandon is another true professional. Both of my boys had to get braces and he made sure he explained the process step by step. I wanted my boys to have a great experience at the dentist and so far it's been great for them.

Overall the entire staff at this office has been great from the welcoming ladies at the front desk, the Dr's and all of the staff that works on giving their patients an overall great experience....GREAT JOB!!!<//text>

<Review>Everyone is so nice here! the receptionists are very sweet and welcoming, and everyone else is very nice and gentle when doing work on your teeth. The doctors are very helpful, and super caring. They make sure you're not in pain, and give you a number to call just in case you begin feeling pain at home. Plus this is the only dentist that I've been to where they give you your own mini Chapstick when they are working on your teeth and your lips get dry which btw comes in verrrry handy! Not to mention Everything looks nice and clean. My whole family has started to come here too. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a new dentist for your family.< /Review>< user>

I hope my review will help you make the best decision for your smile.
I am so happy that I finally found Select Dental over 2 years ago. It has been by far the BEST dental experience I have ever had. Not to mention the BEST work that I have ever had done. Even after working in the dental field for over 20 years. I still get very anxious when going to the dentists for myself ( yes I'm a scardy cat)  the entire staff go above & beyond to put me at ease. Dr. Salo & Dr. Salamonti have done such an amazing job that I love my smile now & I smile all the time. I recently moved to Santa Fe New Mexico & will continue to come back to LA for my dental needs. When you've had one bad experience after another, then you find such a great office with an amazing staff that genuinely cares about the work they're doing you just Stay.

<text>Without question in the past 10 years that I have sought dental maintenance and treatment at this office, I have found Dr. Dean Salo to be the most honest and professional dentist I have ever encountered.  Because of his and his staff's advice and treatment over the years, I have saved many thousands of dollars by taking their proactive advice and following up with multiple periodic maintenance visits every year.  Dr. Dean Salo is one of the most reputable health professionals I have known and I would highly recommend his services along with his very dedicated and hard working staff to anyone needing a second opinion about dental care or as a new patient.

Recently, I have had advanced dental treatment by both Dr. Gangel and Dr. Salo over several months and again commend them both and their highly professional dental staff that continue to provide outstanding dental care and treatment.  I have found this dentistry group to be very compassionate, cordial, sincere and most competent when compared to other dental practices I used in the South Bay over 10 years ago for a brief period until I found this one.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Michael is who helped me and he was fantastic. I was looking to rent a storage space as well as a car parking spot. He showed me both and was quick and efficient about it. He was also quick and efficient when it came to getting the paperwork done.  Very nice and friendly. I’ve seen many storage locations and some are very dingy looking. This location is clean and well kept. I would recommend this Public Storage location!</Review>< pictures>

That being said, Gerado, Dawna and Gabe were excellent during my visits to this store. They greeted me with a smile and made me feel very welcome upon arrival. On one of the hottest days of the summer Gerardo showed me my storage unit that I had reserved on line with a smile and a great attitude . He was thorough in giving me all the details that I would need upon entering and exiting the property. I returned the day after to purchase product for my move and Dawna's Customer Service was just as amazing. Thank you so much for hiring Associates that care about the customer and that love doing their jobs !!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgqaFl_mhfXoP1UBofJ48ILwHY-6jY0M9KroH2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c28f8935f789f5:0x1a7efc42dd6aa31f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The customer service here is less than excellent!  I wasn’t sure on the amount space I would need.  I ask the lady if she could show me a medium size unit .  She was very hesitant on showing the space.. she was very unfriendly & rude.  When someone comes to spend money with a company ....at the least they should receive excellent customer service.< /text></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Thank you Michael for being such a wonderful representative of Public Storage.  You are friendly, helpful and willing to listen to my concerns and solve them.  I hope your company realizes what a great representative you are of this facility and the reason why they are getting such great reviews.  He really deserves to be well compensated for his tremendous efforts in running this facility so efficiently and treating your customers so well that they will tell others why this is the best place to come.

I have to say, Michael is one of the best customer service reps I’ve ever encountered. He was so warm, inviting and patient, answered all of our questions, and was over all incredibly friendly. The property was well maintained and seemed safe. When it’s time I need a unit I will come here for sure! Thank you Michael!</review>

I have a real problem with this location. It is a site my work uses. But there is only 1 bathroom, in the main office, and each of the 4 times I've been at the site, for some period of time, the office was closed, with a sign saying "Will return at..". I've never had a storage unit without an accessible bathroom, I think this is a major issue.</text>

Thanks Michael for showing us around the site and helping make a great decision on what we needed. It’s been very hectic lately and it was nice to have a stress free, easy experience. The facility is clean and well secured. People are great. Plus I got a great deal. Would highly recommend!!</Review>

Amazing place to store your special belongings ! This is the first time I have had to rent a storage unit as I am currently moving from my home but have not found a new one. Michael has been helping me from the beginning and has guided me through the process  as well as shown me the units that would fit my need. I definitely have to recommend you speak with Michael if you need any assistance or have any questions as he has been more than welcoming and informative in this whole process. Moving and looking where to store your belongings is stressful as it is so I definitely thank Michael for his knowledge and his help throughout the whole thing ! Public storage definitely needs employees like Michael ! Thank you again !<//review>

This facility is A GEM and I am VERY IMPRESSED! The office, units, elevator bank, and grounds are all very clean and well maintained and I am confident that my items are safe within the secure grounds.  Equally important is the great customer service I have received from both Rafael and Michael - they paid attention to detail, made sure I was well acclimated with the property, and outlined everything I would need to know in an easy to understand way.  Seriously, they could teach lessons on customer care.   An added bonus is the appropriate safety measures they are taking during COVID-19. I *highly* recommend this location, Rafael, and his team!</Text>

Would rent with them again. Clean spaces, and convenient location.

With the help of Michael, Raphael & Maria I was able to get all my belongings smoothly moved into a unit. The team are both friendly and helpful, which I sincerely appreciated. Their process is very easily navigated and simple but they also have comforting security measures. Great facility, would recommend.<//review>

The customer service is great, the facility is clean and convenient. I've been using it for 5 months now and I've never gave them any trouble, paid my account 270.00 on time if not early yet i get an email saying my rates are going up to 321.00!!  I mean really?! THAT IS RIDICULOUS!!  Guess I'll be leaving real soon, I'm not paying 321.00 if i can help it.<//Text>

The employees Maria and Rafael have always been extremely helpful and kind.Most other storage spaces are not as clean and well kept as this one. It's not that close to my location but definitely worth the ease and calmness. I wish the hours were a little more flexible for people who work daily but it is what it is. Appreciate the help with finding my unit and explanation on how the process goes.<//Review>

Two words: Customer Service!

I walked in without an appointment 20 minutes before closing and Gerardo and Dawna went above and beyond in helping me obtain a storage unit! I was in a hurry and they kept this in mind the entire time while helping me which is what I appreciated the most. They gave me a tour of the premises and I felt secure in the fact that my possessions would be safe from observing the various security measures that have been put in place. The unit they showed me was clean and move-in ready and they had the exact unit size that I wanted. I told them what I wanted and they were straight to the point on everything from pricing to insurance. Thank you again Dawna and Gerardo you guys are awesome!</Text>

<review>This facility has always been clean. The employees have always been super helpful and nice as well. It's a bit out of the way from central LA but that slight in convenience is totally worth it for the staff and ease and use of the facility. I wish it were open later on weekends and weekdays but that's whatever and the hours across almost any storage place.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Ive been renting this storage for 4 years.  $120  a month and my debit card expires. I'm notified the following month that i owe 2 months worth. The same week I'm notified i go down there to clear my 2 items out of storage and they forbid me to come in untill the balance is paid. i moved to the central coast 2 years ago. Apparently, 4 years of no late payment means nothing because they put my stuff on lean and were going to open up my locker on top of tacking on additional chargers in order to take my stuff out. That is horsesh*t, no loyalty. they only want your money and no nothing about customer care. Needless to say, i cleared my storage and will never do business with them again! Run Now! They're salvages only out for your money!<//Text>

I like to hear answers from people face to face to reassure myself, and Maria (who helped me before) helped do just that! I felt bad I kept bugging her and questioning her answers but she was nothing but compassionate and assuring. I even came back with a gift card to show my appreciation. Looking forward to coming back here.< /text></record>

The entire experience was very easy and the staff was great. Laura and Linda each helped us through the entire process, all the paperwork (all paperless actually) - they were very professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and very helpful. We were walked through the location, made aware of all the contingencies and answered all our questions . They couldn’t have been nicer or more helpful, I highly recommend this location and its services. The location was clean ,private, had new facilities, we’d go nowhere else .<//review>

I do want to mention that the property Manager Brenda gave me exceptional service.  She was courteous, very professional, and extremely attentive.  I was really surprised to see what great care she shows to everyone that walks into the office.</text>< Pics>

Was helped by Laura, this whole process was fast and fairly painless (first time renter). Simply put all my questions were answered before I asked. Place is clean and well kept and the staff is very friendly. The half off deal I got is fantastic< /Text>

Fred and the other employees have been outstanding. Any questions that I had they answered. When I first needed a unit they were so understanding and gave me all the information I needed. They went over leasing agreement, showed me where my unit was, explained basically how to do everything (since I was a newbie). Every time I go they always have smiles on their faces and are willing to assist in any way possible!

Love this storage facility!!!<//review>

<Review>Over the weekened I went to the facility  to transfer to a smaller unit  I called before arriving.  When I arrived Brenda was ready to help me and based on the conversation we had earlier she knew exactly why I was there. The transfer was quick and easy. She really gave me helpful tips and the overall experience  was great.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c28f8935f789f5:0x1a7efc42dd6aa31f<//gmapID>< user_name>

Over the weekend my family and I went to get a  storage at this location. Was greeted and helped  by the on site manager Brenda. She was very helpful. She answered all of our questions. We have never rented a storage unit before and She made it super easy. Thank you for the great service and attentiveness.</text>

Jennifer and Laura were amazing in helping me rent space today😃.

I observed both employees exercise great patience and courtesy with some very difficult customers.

They are great employees for Public Storage.  Your company is lucky to have such great employees who really love their job.<//review>

< Review>
The manager was nice, but (according to her) her bosses 'make' her do stuff like this:  You are required to buy insurance from us (not true, and in the end I didn't), Here is a 10x10 unit (the first one was actually 9x9, 20% smaller, but I held out until she offered me a full 10x10 unit), PLEASE buy some packing supplies, if your disabled mother-in-law can't come in to sign personally then we won't honor the online reservation you made (but she eventually did after making a call)...</Review>

I made sure to have all of our stuff out of our storage by the 9.30.16 to avoid paying any prorated charges. But because I didn't "close" out my account with the final walk through on the 30th, they charged us a prorated charge of $19.81for closing it out on 10.1.16. It's not the money it's the principal...the storage unit was EMPTY!!
I'll make sure that this review is all over social media :)</Review>

I decided to book a unit online and within 10 minutes I got a call from Rocio verifying everything. I went to the facility and was greeted by Amanda who assisted me with showing me my storage unit and filling out the paperwork. She was very helpful and did a double check of moving supplies that I might need. The facility was easy to get to, tidy, and seems very secure.</review>

I have been a client of this property long before Public Storage took it over a year or so ago. Recently I reconfigured the attic of my home making an outside storage unit unnecessary, but I couldn't leave without telling the guys, Rafel and Eric, what a great job they are doing. The property is well-maintained inside and out, and staff is always polite and professional and it is really a safe place to store your "stuff".<//text>

<review>A total rip off.....be prepared to be nickle and dime to death and your rent to be raised the minute that they are able to. I can't believe that is legal to charge all of the various fines or fees that this company does if you are late on your rent.  I wish I would have done a little research on this company before renting from them, as they have plenty of angry former customers online. I would not recommend this place to anyone, they are absolutely the worst.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Jocie did an amazing job finding the perfect unit for me on short notice!  Jonny was on hand to resolve any issues that I had.  Check-in was smooth, customer service was professional, and check out was hassle-free. I would recommend this location to my friends and family.<//review>

Had to find storage the day I moved from Northern Ca,, and with one call to Lidya, all stress was relieved. She spent the time to give me all the details to make it easy to choose an appropriate space. After getting moved in, Vanessa and Rocio have been a delight to help me whenever I needed it. Truly, it's been a good experience, overall!</text>

We had a problem with our lock and not only did we get great service to fix it this morning, they actually explained to us what happened and how they fixed the problem. The two guys here are always nice and welcoming (I don't know their names but one is asian and one is hispanic) and the manager is very knowledgeable as well!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I booked my storage unit online and within 10 minutes I got a call from Rocio asking if I would like to see the unit before my checkin day. I went to the facility and was greeted by Amanda and Rocio who assisted me with filling out paperwork and showing me my storage unit. They were very helpful!< /Review>

LAPD is investigating and it is our opinion that something is not right within PS.  Surveillance video is at a dead end.  Our items were very large and in some instances needed two people to move.  Very sad and disturbing.  Unhappy that I am paying monthly rent to have my items stolen and then have to jump through hoops to see if PS insurance will even cover what has been stolen.  LAPD has offered more help than PS management.  We are moving out since our belongings are not secure.</text>< username>

<Review>Outstanding service. From the minute you drive in, the technicians are at your service. They are friendly, professional, and thorough. I went to this Jiffy Lube to get my car a synthetic oil change. Air in tires was checked, windows were washed, all fluids were checked, the battery was checked. The battery charge was very low and I had been worried about it. This next week I will be back at Jiffy for new battery and to get the transmission fluid changed. This desert heat is so hard on engines. I am also getting new air filter and cabin filter installed. They offer so many products and services while you stay with your car the whole time. A coupon was applied to the cost of the oil change and I didn't have a coupon; they just applied it. This is the only place I will bring my car for all services they provide. I highly recommend this Jiffy Lube.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Been going to the same location for years. The team is respectful, thorough and quick. They let you know the issues without trying to upsell. Always a pleasure. And always a coupon lol.</review>

I am giving 5 stars because l cant give 10!! They were so helpful and informative.While getting an oil change and recharge to my air conditioner,  I thought l was going to  need an expensive repair to my A.C.,but Rudy took the time to fix a loose hose to the A.C. and probably saved me alot of time and money that would of gone to a less honest mechanic.... and he did it free of charge! I will continue to bring them my business for as long as l am in the desert!! Thank you for all you do Guys!!Special shout out to Rudy...you're a class act!!!</review>

I actually visited another Jiffy Lube on Fred Waring, by walmart- I called, asked if they could do a tire rotation on my jeep- they said yes, that i didn't need an appointment- when I arrived, they told me their lift could not lift my Jeep - "but I just called you?! and you said you could do it?"  I drove to this Jiffy Lube and got the most friendly service ever, at 5:30 on a Saturday night- Best guys work in there, so kind to help me out- 5 stars!!!!</Text>

I went in for a oil change and a  mechanic by the name of Tony recommended I get a transmission flush I agreed because they’ve always taken care of me  I asked if there’s service ACs here because I needed my AC serviced as well he said yes and then he took me inside the building  and showed me how much it would be for everything if I were to be charged by Jiffy Lube and the total came out to around $1200.  I told him no that it was too expensive and he seemed real pushy .  And just overall began being very unprofessional   he said he was “leveling” with me and  he would be able to do all the work that I wanted to do to through him personally for $600. Cash only. Of course I agreed because I figured he was helping me and was going to take care of me like they all do. The entire time I was Letting him know I don’t understand what’s happening and the main end result I wanted was for my AC to blow cold air he said yes It would blow cold air.  I left my car with him for 20 minutes I went to the bank and before I could return he called me from a personal phone number and told me my AC hose had a leak in it so he couldn’t maintenance my AC.  I thought that was fine I would take my oil change and transmission flush and be on my way. I return to the store and he has me follow him to the side of the building where I assume no one can see us and demands I pulled my wallet out and give him $400 cash.  At that point I didn’t know what to do I felt really uncomfortable and I just wanted to get my receipt and be on my way. He then took me inside the building and  change the number that we agreed on and said that we agreed on $500.  At this time I was really feeling intimidated and even more than uncomfortable I no longer felt  make a customer and started to feel like I was being told what to do he then rang me up for an oil change and I had to pay another hundred dollars for that so overall I gave TONY $600 cash.  Confused and completely flabbergasted I just collecting my things and left as fast as I could completely unaware of what  just really took place. I handed the receipt to my wife and drove off, she looked at the receipt and said I was only charge for an oil change so why did I give him all that money then. I told her I didn’t know and she said that’s not right.  I agreed and when I drove back to get a better understanding of what he did to my car, immediately he tried walking my off the property.  I tried asking him to explain what he did to my car he said he flushed my transmission changed my oil and my oil filter and he flush my radiator when I try to explain that he made me feel like I got burned and this didn’t feel right and I wanted my Money back. He laughed in my face and gave me $40 and told me no one is taking anything from him at that point I was so frightened I just went back to my car.   I didn’t know what to do or who to tell so I told my mom and she went down to the store and they told her that Tony doesn’t even work on cars at that establishment so you can imagine my level of frustration and discomfort. I could get things to add up in my head so I did a little  research and found out that a transmission flush and a radiator flush take anywhere from 3 to 4 hours to 2-6 hours. I left my car with that man for twenty five minutes to forty five minutes maximum. Jiffy lube I feel violated and taken advantage of. Im legit afraid to go back to your store, TONY took a picture of my information on his personal phone which was even more unsettling I’ve never been more forced or intimidated to make a purchase in my life. I want me money back, of course, although no amount of money will restore my trust in your business. I hope that management sees this and takes affirmative action because god forbid TONY has done this to another naive person. Over all I’m extremely upset and will be contacting the Corporate office and advising the health department about the lack of precaution that man took to prevent the spread of covid 19 in your establishment.<//Review>

Rude and dishonest. You have criminals working there probably gang members that use their intimidation to force people into making purchases they don’t need. Disgusting!!!!! I call over 10 times a day and there is never a manager. I am literally afraid  to go back to that facility.</review>

I have had oil changes here before and service was great
Today I stoped in just looking for some help. I am using a lender car while my car is in for tune up etc. well the loner is leaking fluid and I was concerned and wasn’t sure what was leaking they checked for me and were very kind to a very senior lady who knows very little about these things. I will always go there for oil changes and recommend them to others.
I stoped elsewhere and was treated very badly<//Review>

<review>Terrible service they did nothing to our car just kept us waiting, then tried to say that they had topped us off and checked our tire pressure. However they somehow did not have a record of our car even being there.  When my fiancee  called to speak to a manager Eduardo was rude to us. Never again going here.< /review>< userid>

<Text>I was here about a week ago to get their tasty bean and cheese burritos. Someone needs to tell this lady that this isn't how you wear a mask. She was talking to the lady at the register while prepping food like this the whole time I was there.

Also my burrito had several chunks of ground beef in it, which wasn't a huge deal for me, but really not good work guys.</Text><Name>Jordan ff</Name><userid>113458193126264339215< /userid><time>1618880030730< /time></record></dataset><record>

Definitely 5 stars - nice staff, good tacos and breakfast burritos. They don't give me a hard time when I ask for extra extra salsas on the side. Much appreciated!< /text>

<user_id>104978520607977653064</user_id><Review>Having lived in San Diego for some time and migrating to the bay, one thing I had truly missed was the great Mexican food in SoCal. I tried this place on an absolute whim since it was not too far from my place. I was entirely surprised, it was very similar to what I used to get in San Diego. There was a little too much sour cream on the tacos for my liking, but that’s totally adjustable. I know next time to ask for less, not a big deal. The tortillas are crispy on the inside and give a nice cheesy crunch. The carne asada is mouth watering, and they give a generous amount of guacamole. The pricing is very fair. Would go back.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

I've been a loyal customer for over 12 years since I started my business Stoneman Fabrications in San Mateo we are constantly driving around  from our shop down the street at 2310 Palm ave to job sites around the bay  Charlie's became our favorite due to their delicious food and salad bar  no to mention the service very efficient very professional we always order for pick up  and if they tell you it will be ready in 10 minutes you better believe it will be ready my employees love Charlie's every time I treat them for lunch or we are around at lunch time nothing beats charlies I personally call it soul food.</Text>

One of the best burritos in the peninsula. The super burrito is absolutely gigantic so don't eat breakfast before coming! The regular plates are also pretty delicious. Come to Charlie's and you'll never be disappointed< /review>

<text>What I ordered: super burrito combo with rice and beans
Meat: grilled chicken

The burrito had a good taste

The rice and beans on the side were not good at all. The stuff in the burrito was better.

No black beans which wasn't the end of the world

Definitely more taste than Pancho villa< /text><user_id>115477860137636863983<//user_id><time>1547958940230< /time>< Gmap_id>

Best burrito in San Mateo. Even the plain veggie burrito has a unique flavor that I haven't found at any other taqueria in the area. Finding parking is a bit hard, but that's downtown San Mateo for you.<//text>

<text>Great find in San Mateo! First Mexican restaurant I’ve ever been to named Charlie’s, but it didn’t disappoint. Come right at opening to beat the crowd, if you can.< /text><Time>1534697562841<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Good food and take out. Cheese enchiladas are my wife's favorite. So always a safe choice for a casual night in San Mateo.<//Review>

So sad! They don't have the spicy tuna tacos anymore. They replaced it with Hamachi but I had it tonight and it tasted rotten! it was so dark in the restaurant so I couldn't see, ate it and hope i don't get food poisoning! The carne asada tacos are still good but sad for my fav item on the menu being gone. Probably will visit less often now.< /review>

<text>This is my 2nd favorite taqueria in San Mateo. Portions are a good size, prices are reasonable, and the chips and salsa bar are the best.
Last couple of times though the food was just so-so. Chicken was dry and lacking in the usual good flavor; if this continues, will have to dock it a star and move on.</text>< name>

Shrimp burito was on point.   Chips are decent and all you can eat. Only complaint was green sauce was sub par but other salsas were great.</Review>

Its funny how they can run ur card and say its not accepted but when ur bank says its been charged. I didnt even eat there because they tried to steal from me even after i went back and told them. I didnt go back through the doors the third time i had to send someone in because how unprofessional they are. Wish i can give them a zero : stealing is a bad way of business< /review>

Good chips and big tacos. The down side to this restaurant is that the salsa is not spicy at all.</Review>

Favourite taqueria in SM! Nice decor & ambiance here. Love the enchiladas plate with rice & beans. Burritos here are gigantic! Salsa/chips bar is well kept with pico de gallo & variety of spicy sauces. Kind staff.< /text>

<Text>I love to go to Charlie's & get their Super Carne Asada Burrito. Its huge & the sauce they put on top of it is great. They have free chips, 3 types of salsa & the usual veggies. Great place if your really hungry and want some Mexican.< /Text>< Pictures>

I'm not much of a food critic or a foodie. Generally I just favor a restaurant based on price and menu options. But Charlie's is one of the few places that stands out to me. Get a carne asada burrito "wet" and it is no question the best burrito I ever had.<//text>

Got the carne asada and lengua tacos, and they were fine, though not outstanding. Salsa and unlimited chips bar near the front. Horchata came in two sizes, was good. Order at the counter, optional tip bin, cash only.</text></record>

<Text>I honestly cannot understand why the public would stand for the way Tesla FORCES customers actually demands that you do all service through the Tesla app! By not having the option to talk to a human the employees are shielded from having to answer to the customers. If you are thinking about buying a Model S the one I have I would think again. The car is great the way the company dose business is not. I ordered a new Platinum model S two days ago and cancelled it today. I simply ran into the buzz saw of the Tesla APP.< /Text>< pictures>

Immaculate new and freshly detailed car at drop off. Atrociously dirty (inside) and dirty outside when “ready” for pick up. As a TSLA stock holder and first time Tesla owner, I am very disappointed.</review>

I bought my wife a Tesla model S about a year ago. We both love the car. It is very luxurious inside and very comfortable. We have solar panels on our roof so there's no cost to run the car, plus they have free charging stations all over the place. I took the car in for regular maintenance there was no charge. They gave me a voucher for free Uber ride home. Tesla does it right. Highly recommended< /text>

<Text>Farzin Morena, a service manager with poor attitude and unprofessional estimate/judgement about vehicle's problem.
1. Our Tesla 2019, the problem is tire's sensor pressure was not operating properly and showing that tire pressure is low.
2. Technician Eric Carrillo checked and told us: "your tire sensor was damaged due to a patching/fixing (nail hole), the warranty is void"
3. We request to talk to the manager, Farzin Morena, he insisted that the "fluid" when patching the tire made the tire sensor bad.
4. We called Tesla customer service and they said "Nothing we could do, we can not override the service department's authority for a wrong estimate..."
5. Manager Farzin added:"the patching for the tire was very cheap and it damages the tire sensor, you guys have a job done by someone did not know what they were doing, you should have bring it into Tesla ...(for a flat tire...?). Farzin asked: "you like the cheap way, that was why it was happened, if you want to get this fix the right way, you must paid $464.00 which include new sensor, new tire and labor cost."
6 We declined the service,  we bought the tire sensor for $75 and went to America's Tire and have them installed, we confirmed with the technician is there anyway that when patching/fixing tire (for a nail hole) causing the tire sensor defected. The technician said never hear or notice that in 20 years.
7. We went to 2 more places America Tire Depot and Tire Metro and asked the same question, they all response: " we have been fixing nail holes for customers everyday and never damage tire sensors at once."
8. Tesla's tire sensors cover with rubber to protect (see pictures), we do not know how it was damaged by liquid like they have said? what were mentioned by the Tesla manager Farzin Morena and Technician Eric Carrillo, in what ways that they came to the conclusion that we have damaged the sensor or they just tried to ignore the warranty and tried to push customer away from Tesla's reputation.
9. After more than 1 month installing new tire sensor (with same old tire), the car work great. (without replace new tire as they required for fixing)
10. We are really disappoint for Tesla's company, they have hired wrong people to work with poor customer's service and terrible skills, (uneducated estimate),  this will affects Tesla brand plunging down badly.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzps1VgoqRG5S8v3wDL1iXa131pniarCPpqbAX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOzkdFWeR13NETL5cuW50lwmSowYTqJzXd1Txv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOM784dqK_UpRAtsii_oXThQy9veqd7ulsCRXpd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Your vehicles and automated tools are wonderful.  Couldn’t be happier.  Unfortunately, any process that involves a human is terrible.  The delivery process was completely inadequate.  I already gave feedback on this and didn’t get a response.   Now I have a service issue and there’s no one with any technical expertise to help.  Perhaps Tesla is not suited for the luxury vehicle market?  Maybe stick to more modestly priced vehicles where there is not as much of an expectation?</text>

Best experience here. Specifically with a gentleman named Modesto. Very knowledgeable and was humble about it.

The experience I've had with the overall staff here has been very positive. If you are reading this and don't have a Tesla yet... Here is your sign to go ahead and get a Tesla =)< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Took a while but service agent found out that I couldn’t pick up my signature wall charger there.

While waiting, without an appointment, an experienced tech took my frunk apart and checked the sensors for any disconnections that may have caused the error message I was getting.  This was slightly past their closing time the tech tried their best and then finally stated that an appointment was required and gave me a hand written note to provide during my appointment of what he checked as well as the error code and time stamp from the car’s logs.

Watching how careful he was with the parts made me confident about having my car serviced their in the future.  Only they were too backlogged and I instead had to make an appointment at the new location in Walnut instead.<//Text>< time>

Explosive service from an auto company that doesn't run off gas! Gilbert Ornelas and Eric (my service advisors) were phenomenal. As a long time Tesla owner, I can confidently say this is the best service center.< /text>

The service representative was knowledgeable, could see the update in progress,  and explained that in some point in the update the car wouldn't respond.

<Review>They automatically stopped my Streaming on my Model 3 which was included with my purchase of the car. Now they decide to start charging a monthly fee AFTER the fact. You can't do that! There was no mention streaming was only a temporary thing. Having streaming included with the purchase of the car was a large factor in purchasing the car as I had to buy the higher model to get the car.
To nickle and dime you after purchasing an expensive car is chintzy and not too cool.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I scheduled an appointment nearly a month ago. Tesla canceled it because it was going to be moved to mobile service. They forgot to move it over to mobile service. When I asked when the mobile ranger appointment would be no one respond in almost two weeks. I tried calling Costa Mesa Service center and no one picks up. When I finally was able to speak to someone on the chat on Tesla's website they rescheduled me for another appointment as if I was requesting new service. No one said this is our mistake and we will get you in immediately. The chat stopped working in the middle of booking the new appointment and now I am not sure if I even have the appointment booked. To be fair I did have another issue I had to add that would mean I have to come to the service center so ultimately I could not use the mobile ranger. I love Tesla, but really wish they would fix their service department.< /Review>

Best. Service. Ever. I made a huge mistake and got some orange peels in my air vents on 1/24/2020. I got there a couple hours before closing and they accepted me without an appointment. The entire staff were welcoming, accommodating and took care of me. One day I will replace our other two cars with Teslas! I really appreciate the service at Costa Mesa, they are the best! I drive all the way from Laguna Niguel and wouldn't trust any other Tesla center. Thank you so much!!< /text>

I took my Model 3 into the Costa Mesa Service Center to fix a rattle that Burbank tried to fix twice.

After pulling up, I wandered around for 10 min., not knowing where to check in, until I was finally told to wait in my car.

After another 20 minutes of waiting in my car, Dan came to my window.  I explained the rattling and he brought over a technician, who confirmed the rattling after a test drive.

Then I talked to Dan again and asked if he could check the brake fluid and let me know if it needs to be changed and fix the rattle.  He drew up the paperwork and it's $195 for the fluid flush and $97.50 to fix the rattle.  I asked, "Isn't the rattle covered by warranty?"  He says, "Well we just put a cost for labor down in case we find out it was due to outside forces like rats nibbling on wires or something."  "But isn't this a carry-over from what the Burbank Service Center couldn't fix?" I asked.  Then he started a word salad about the California Lemon Law and how if an issue isn't fixed by the fourth time you have the right to return the vehicle.  That's why they put a labor cost on the estimate.  (I am assuming so it looks like a new problem instead of an existing one.)  "So you put down a cost to get around that law?" I asked.  His next answer was like a politician deflecting a question, about how they are the hub for Tesla repairs and they get hundreds of cars a week, and they have experienced people there.  I had to stop him from going on with his non-answer and said, "When I took it into Burbank, they had this zeroed out both times."  He explained then that he always tried to side with the customer when it comes to warranty issues.  He wants his customers to have a good experience and because it's only $100 he has no problem eating the cost.

It had been 2 hours at this point, so I signed and left.

After two days, my car was ready and because I had to work, my wife to picked up my car.

Her experience was the same as mine.  She parked and wandered around until someone told her to wait.  After 30 minutes of waiting, someone came out and asked, "Who's next?"  She looked around at the other people waiting, and since no one knew who was next, she stood up and said, "I think it's me."

She told me after that they charged her $300 and I asked for the receipt.  She said they didn't give her one.  I then tried to look at the estimate they had emailed me to sign, but when I clicked the "review and sign" link, I was greeted with a "This document has already been signed," message, with no option to download.  I hadn't received any invoices via email, or via the Tesla app either.  I called the Service Center but there was no answer, so I left a message.

The next day I received a text from Dan saying I'll get a survey and if he didn't get 5 stars, to contact him.

I replied that I never received notification I would be charged and would like to see the receipt.

Dan sends me the invoice and I see I was charged for the fluid flush and the rattling.

I text him back:

"So I was charged for the rattling? That wasn't a warranty issue?"

He responds:

"Yes. You were charged $97.50 for the rattle. This was not a warranty repair. Rattles and squeaks are only covered for the first 6 months of ownership."

I respond:

"You told me I would only be charged if it was due to outside forces like rats. You mentioned nothing about 6 months. Was what you told me when I signed the document untrue?"

After 2 days with no response, I text:

"Hey Dan, I'm looking for a response to my last question."

He has yet to respond.

The Costa Mesa Service Center seems unorganized, uncaring, and it feels like your typical shady car shop.

This was my wife's first experience with Tesla.  After months of trying to convince her to trade in her Mercedes SUV for a Model Y, she flatly rejected it saying, "I don't want to have to take my car to that shop.  Tesla's service is so bad."</Review>< pictures>

The service portal massaging is terrible. I dont know why I cant speak with someone rather than using the app. Paying to much money without being able to speak with maintenance professionals. It's really hectic. Tesla should be better than that.< /Review>

I don't know what everybody's complaining about here.   Maybe someone read these reviews and fixed things.  I just had an incredible service experience there.  All things under warranty - which was nice.  Gave me a loaner, which was nice.  I used Superchargers on the loaner, so I didn't pay for home charging.  My phone APP told me when the car was ready and I showed up, turned in my loaner, and drove off in my fixed Tesla.  Super simple.<//Text>

I had a scheduled appointment on Tuesday at 1:15pm and arrived exactly on time.  I had to wait out on the street they were so backed up. I was pretty sure that I was not going to get my car back that day,  but it is now Friday and I have not heard a word since Wednesday.  No loaner's were available on Tuesday, so they gave an Uber Coupon that expired yesterday. I called Wednesday and was told they were waiting for a part and some one would call back that day with an ETA.  No call back.  So I place multiple calls yesterday and today : No answer!  Leave a message and someone will call back - no call back.  Sorry Tesla,  the car is great,  but you need to get this mess sorted!<//Review>

<Review>They kept my car for 30 days a for a screen freezing issue and it was not resolved and to boot one of the rims was damaged,  they referred me to a guy that could repair it which the guy did a great job fixing the rim but I still haven't heard back about the refund on what I paid out of pocket to get it fixed and its been well over a month.  The only saving grace of that place is the Service Rep Brad, super nice and helpful guy.   I might have to take a dive down there and wait for them to cut me a check for the damage< /Review><Rating>2< /Rating>< name>

Wonderful experience with the Tesla service center staff. I am very proud to be a Tesla owner. Knowing I have this service center to visit each time makes me happy and worry free also. The staff went above and beyond to help me with a few small issues. It was a surprisingly pleasant experience servicing my car.< /Text>

I had a very positive experience at the Service Center. There were a few small items that needed to be resolved from delivery of my Model 3. Checking in was timely, they set me up with a loaner Model S for the day. The communication was goot with my advisor, overall a positive experience.</Text>

Great experience at my first service visit. Took my new Model 3 in for minor adjustments after taking delivery. I expected the service facility to be more busy these days and wasn’t sure what to expect, but check in took only 15 min and a friendly service rep assisted me with my issues. I was pleased to also get a Model S as a loaner. Repairs were done in one day and I picked up my car the next morning. Fantastic service. Thanks Tesla.< /review>

This was my 3rd annual service at Costa Mesa, CA service station, currently costing $750 for Tesla-S. Had to wait almost a month to get an appointment. When I finally dropped off the car, the place was jammed with cars, some waiting in the street. Never had a problem like that with my other car, a  Mercedes-Benz. Heard other people complaing about same problems with this service center.  PS. Dropped off the car last Thursday (March 2019), Monday still no estimated time of completion
available. $ days without a car or date of completion. Not a good omen
for Tesla's future.<//Review>

I used to enjoy Tesla Service but find myself continually disappointed now. It takes at least a week to get an appointment which is frustrating when everything fixed is a warranty issue and not a maintenance service. When arriving, you usually end up waiting at least 10 minutes before someone is able to sign you in. This particular time, I've been waiting in my car for 30 minutes and all they've done is "gotten the process started ". The people who make appointments always offer loaners but there hasn't been one available when I arrive for the last couple times. Last time I ended up waiting an hour and a half afterbefore they finally gave me an enterprise rental. I find myself ignoring issues with my car just because I don't want to take it in. I used to be happy with my purchase but miss my old reliable Chevy Volt where I could just drop it off for service and be merrily on my way.<//Text>

My Texla X 100D had a lot of problems.  I called and had to wait several weeks.  The operator was very nice and said it would take several hours to fix.

I was very surprised when come there.  It was jammed of cars there.  Waiting for a long time.

A lot of staff occupied the waiting rooms looking at their phone.  Also about 6,7 sat in the booths out side, but it looked like only one or two really worked, ran between the car.

Instead of several hours, I was told to wait several days.  I could not wait for loan car, said I would take care of my self.  The customer service man said I would have some credit for it.

After several days, I had to call to ask if the jobs have been done.

Eventually, when I got the car back, it was extremely dirty, they said almost no problems was found, no credit was give for me to have loan car.

Some one was using the Google in my car to entertain some thing.

The customer service man was nice, but too busy.

It seemed the coordination is to bad, no team work, no discipline there.  The staff  seemed was not well trained, either skills nor attitude to do their job.

Tesla is good car in general, but the service for car problem is unbelievable inefficient in this center.

My car have some of the same  problems and new problems, but I am scared with the service and hesitate to call for service.

I hope the management of the service center will be reviewed and will be a focus of the company.

Need to have better trained and supervision of staff over there to be sure all if them working honestly, professionally, and efficiency.

I like the functions of Tesla.  But the services, as I experienced there, were so inefficient and unpleasure.

I wish I will be able to refer more clients to Tesla as I wished, but with these kind of services, I dare not.

Visited for the first time after one day wait schedule. I was advised that the service would take two to four days and was put a wait for a loner car. Within few minutes, the supervisor told me it would take about an hour then they provide my family a round trip while my car were serviced.

Bryan is a very kind supervisor and did good work on my car. I am leaving this review not because the issues were fixed but also all the communication went well in professional manner with warmest kindness.

Thanks to all teams in Tesla at long beach!!!< /Text>

This is one of the busier Tesla Service centers. They are often overwhelmed, and that has been consistently the case since I've been going here since 2013.  They often promise to follow up things, or to add something to your repair ticket, but they frequently drop things.  You constantly have to remind them to do things.  If you have several minor issues you have scheduled an appointment for in the future, then have to go in for an emergency, they'll just take care of the emergency issue and make you come back a second time. They have zero flexibility in their schedule.  People are nice, but the customer service people aren't very knowledgeable. If you are a car enthusiast, or just someone who knows a little more than average about cars, your questions will certainly throw their customer service people into nervous shuffling mode.  In addition, they clearly have only worked at Tesla, since they're thrown off by simple questions you typically ask your mechanic, like "can I see the old part you replaced?" Forget it. You're never gonna see that part.  You'll probably also never get an explanation about what that part does, or what went wrong with it, or how sure they are that it was the root cause, and won't fail again soon due to some other problem.  Each time you have an issue, they act like it's the first time they've ever seen that issue, so they can't answer any questions about it.  That's clearly not current, since Teslas have less than half the moving parts of a regular car... There can only be so many things that go wrong... You'd expect them to be experts after only a short while.

They do their best to provide good customer service with a smile, but they don't have this business down the way experienced car dealerships and independent mechanics do.

All the same, your car will get fixed eventually, and almost everything is done free under warranty service, so my complaints are really just from an engineer who wants to know the details, as I've always done with every car I've ever owned.</Text>

As note, the TESLA model 3 keeps a record of events that the tech can check, so only a very brief reason as to why the car is being brought in is required.  Also, don't forget turn mic on and say "BUG REPORT" if you driving to report and capture the info to TESLA.< /Text>< Pics>

Not only did I have to wait over 2 weeks for an appointment for this latest service, but today I had to wait well over an hour for a loaner.

Confession, it raily pains me to write this review for I was the biggest fan of Tesla, its tecnology and mission and their accomplishments. I am reviewing Tesla service center in Costa Mesa, Ca. To begin with, highly disorganized entrance to the small parking lot. I literally had to push one of the guy off so I could get off the driveway as a line was forming behind me. No guidance whatsoever. Then, after 15-20 min sitting in my car, Mr. Modesto showed up  and kindly and with highly condescending tone enlightened me that I had indeed purchased a car and not a computer. He tells me using teslawaze site on my browser was causing my 2019 MX To shut down and restart 4-5 times since I bought the car late last Dec. including back up camera, sound system etc.  Remember 386 computers early 90s?   I didn’t and still don’t believe him. He started arguing with me and gets out and slams my car door. I left my car there for 4-5 days and they found pretty much nothing wrong with. I cant wash off snow marks after two visits to mammoth. Not their issue. Breaks squeaking...not a problem. Car shutting down and freezing...nothing wrong with it. So, out of 4/5 problems, fixed one—a squeaking seat. When ready, the car had 15 miles worth of charge. Was on the phone for 20 min to tell them to put some charge on the car so it doesn’t run out before getting home. When I picked it, they hadn’t even dusted the car, never mind detail/wash etc. I have literally had better service at Kia. What an enthusiastic Tesla owner I was and what a spectacular let down. For 100,000+ car to crash because I am running one of its feature and service that reminds me of those old cheesy used car dealerships !!!!!! What a disappointment. I guess I am a one time Tesla owner.< /Text>

<Review>Not very user friendly. Have to make an appointment. Must leave car. No loaner car provided. They did not address all of my concerns and I had to return. They have an answering machine and nobody answers the phone. No follow up when I completed a survey with negative comments. It seems they really don't care. Not what you would expect when you pay that much for a car.<//Review>< Pictures>

They are very polite and professional and try to solve the problem. However, they are too busy. It can be difficult to get an appointment. Plus they took away the snacks and awesome espresso maker! Even the Lexus service center has bagels, donuts and espresso...< /Text>

<review>Worst service ever. Never called to let me know my car was ready (they had it for 2 weeks). I finally get my car back and they stole the decal that lets me into my neighborhood (these decals are not easy to remove) and my fastpass. Bunch of thieves. I will NEVER purchase a Tesla ever again.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I had my model 3 for over a year. My window stopped working, (won't close) came by and very quick this gentleman took care of it (making it close) but explained me that the buttons needed to be replaced, waited a week and called, a lady who identified herself as "jen" told me that I need to do it online and offered to provide me with the email, Wich I can find myself if I called is because I needed answers, she told me she can't do anything for me not even give me an update on my work order even tho she told me she had a laptop or tablet with access to it, the point is , why would Tesla employ people with the purpose to answer the phones and tell customers to go find hepl by themselves?</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcdffd35baf361:0x8f44e85a8efbb61a</GmapID></record>

I had a flat tire 2 months ago and dropped it off after a tow company put a loaner tire on
After almost a dozen phone calls and emails I have received no response even from multiple customer service reps that promised me that they would let Costa Mesa know and get back to me
Not the kind of service I expected from Tesla at all<//Review>

Our experience was great, the restaurant is small but managed to space out tables to provide distance. The service was phenomenal! We had to change an order because of religious limitations and they were so nice about it. Their restrooms were clean even though the restaurant was so busy.< /Review>

<text>I always want to like this place, but I feel like everytime I go there is just someone that is a deal breaker. Tonight it was that their $16 pork tacos totaled about 1 taco worth of meat. Meat was fine, but just such a small amount of food. The service was great, food was pretty good, portions are not great and prices are fairly high for the feel of the food and place. 3.5 is really my rating and I'll probably give it another shot ordering something else and maybe it will get to 4.
Update: Been back a couple more times and found some sandwiches/burgers I really like and the salad is quite good. I'll be sticking to those and cooking back occasionally! Makes its way to a 4 star rating.<//text>< Time>

We enjoy Hula's for its great food, great drinks, and great vibes.

My usual order is the seared Ahi—high-quality fish that is prepared just right.

My partner goes for the jerk chicken—very flavorful and very spicy.

Throw in a couple of their killer cocktails and you have the makings of a great night out!< /text>

Drinks were okay. Waiters/Waitresses were very welcoming, but there was one guy in particular that was a little intrusive. Main dish was pretty good! Price was right with quality of food and atmosphere.

I guess I would say: avoid appetizers (or just avoid the overtly glorified tots at the very least) get main dish, and enjoy a drink.< /Review>< Rating>

We’ve been here before and will keep returning when in town. Consistently fun atmosphere, knowledgeable servers, and great food except for the new strange salty pudding with chia seeds that we returned to the kitchen. It was cold outside for Easter so we reserved an inside table for six. We loved the Akua planted-based kelp burger house special! The macadamia nut crusted mahi-mahi and Hula’s pan fried barramundi were also a hit. The Kingston crab curry was excellent! The drinks rule!< /Review>

A great spot by the Monterey Bay Aquarium to grab a meal after exploring the aquarium itself or Cannery Row! The menu is diverse and hearty! The blacked ahi sandwich is delicious! A huge piece of tuna with Cajun seasonings sandwiched between ciabatta buns, the slaw complements it well. The entire thing will leave you dreaming for more.   Duke's Luau Pork left a little to be desired.  It felt more like a teriyaki pulled pork dish, still! it wasn't bad.  Just not what I was expecting.<//text>

It was really warm/stuffy so we asked if there were available tables on their outside patio. The host helped us out and it was great! It was happy hour time, WORTH IT!! $6 Craft tiki cocktails and $6 pupus (small plates). The food came out fast and it was absolutely delicious! We had the coconut shrimp rolls, seared ahi and the abalone style calamari: All must tries!!! I tried the lilikoi Marg, it was really sour but still enjoyed it. The Mai-Tai was my favorite. My S/0 had the One Eyed Pirate which reminded me of a mule, so good!! It was a wonderful experience and I wish we had room for their extravagant pies!< /review>< GmapID>

This place is my favorite. I eat in many restaurants but here I go the most. The team is very chummy and the food they place on your table is so appetizing. I never decline to have a nice dinner here. Highly recommended.</Review>

Great vibe and awesome food. I got the Kingston and it was loaded with fish and crab. Spicy but not too spicy and was very filling. Recommended if you’re very hungry and like spicy dishes. Great service as well.</text>

Food was good.  Showed up with no reservation so the was a wait time.  They had seating outside.  We ended up ordering takeout and that went well.  They took our phone number and called us when our food was ready. We walked around while we waited, but it didn't take too long.<//Review>

Great spot for some outdoor dining. They have a nice backyard patio with a ton of seating, heating lamps, and the staff were all very COVID-safe. Food was great and service was outstanding as well.<//text>

<Text>We really enjoy the Hawaiian vibe and menu here. It's friendly and laid back. Great happy hour drinks and pupus. No kid's menu but they will find options for you if needed. Some of our favorites are the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls, the Jungle Curry Bowl with tofu and the Key Lime Pie.<//Text>< Rating>

<Text>Holy cow. This place is amazing! The drinks are so good, the food is unique and delicious, and the LILIKOI PIE IS ABSOLUTELY HEAVENLY!!! we have been here a few times and the tiki drinks are tasty and a great price! The food is always good- we’ve had tacos, sandwiches, bowls, and poke. But the star of the show is the passion fruit lilikoi pie! It’s absolutely delicious and worth a trip on its own!! We love it here! And the patio is a delight!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Hula's is one of our go-to places for vegan and vegetarian friendly options. The staff includes some of the coolest folks in Monterey. They're seasonings are top notch, and their cocktails are incredible - my favorite is the pink bikini martini, which, I kid you not, tastes just like pink jolly ranchers. Shout out to our favorite server, Daniel, for always bringing joy and positive vibes with his service!<//review>

Fun place awesome food, tiki cocktails, and service. Seared ahi tuna sandwich, coleslaw, fries were all fabulous. I also was a big fan of the jerk sauce - I asked our server for a side of it and dipped my fries in it... OMG killer sauce man ! Great outdoor eating area as well. First time ever to Monterey location, I usually go to Santa Cruz location, both are great, highly recommend either !</text>

<review>I really was looking forward to trying this place as I had been looking for a tiki bar in the area for some time. I was happy to see all the great reviews but I’m honestly confused how it gets such good ratings. The decor and atmosphere is nice but that might be the best thing about it. The first thing I noticed was the water had an awful taste like dirty tap water. We asked for lemons to cover up the taste. I got a Lillikoi margarita which was supposed to have a passion fruit flavor. The margarita was extremely sour like drinking a lemon, didn’t notice any passion fruit. No salt rim. My fiancé wanted a blended drink like a pina colada and was told they don’t have a blender?? He decided to get a mai tai which was sour too but not as sour as my drink. I then asked for a different drink and got a zombie which the waiter recommended. It tasted like rotten fruit. There’s no other way to describe it. Probably the worst drinks I’ve ever had. They did not charge me for my drinks which I appreciated. I ended up sticking with water. I got a fish sandwich which was pretty good. I did like the sauce but it didn’t have much seasoning. The fries were good but pretty greasy and I had a bit of a stomachache after eating. Maybe it was just an off day but I don’t know. Something was seriously wrong with this place especially for the price you’re paying.<//review>< Pics>

Cozy and trendy. Really tasty food and nice drinks. We got the Bai full rack of ribs and the pork sliders. Both were delicious, tender, and seasoned nicely. Next time I'll get a dessert because they looked amazing!</Text>

I just adore this place; food is fantastic, atmosphere is unique and fun, and staff are always on their A game.  I’m in Monterey regularly for business and always make it a point to stop here.  Love what you guys do!<//Text>

If you're looking for the best of what the area has to offer, this place is it!  Don't fall into the tourist trap, walk a few minutes to greatness!< /Review>< pics>

<text>Great vibe here. The staff answers all your questions and you feel like they love working there. We went at a time when it wasn't so crowded (mid afternoon) and really enjoyed our visit. The food is good but does not blow your socks off. Save room for dessert and a drink those definitely elevated our experience and put this place over the top. Big thanks to our waiter(Dan), hope I got that right, he  recommend the perfect dessert and drink.</text>< userid>

<text>It is soooo greeaaatt!!! We loved the bbq pork, fish taco and coconut shrimp roll. However the poke bowl is not as good probably bc it has barely no sauce in it. A bit teriyaki sauce or eel sauce would have been good to go with! Overall, it’s a nice place to have family dinner or go on a date with you SO!< /text>< pictures>

One of my favorite spots while visiting. Came during happy hour and loved everything!! The only complaint would be that the portions were tiny,  even for the $6 happy hour discount.  I highly recommend.< /text>

<Text>OK food & decent happy hour prices. Very slow, not super friendly service. Rushed out after finally getting our food & drinks - along with the table behind us - because "we have reservations waiting for the tables." One of our appetizers was incorrect but it took so long to get the order we didn't even try to fix it. In general, not an inviting vibe.<//Text>< time>

Definitely stumbled into this place, and the vibe is that of a local gem! We were truly thrilled to have found this place, and dieing happy hour! A very generous list of pupus all 6$, Wednesday all wine bottles are half priced during happy hour, and all Tiki's drinks process are rolled back! Worth a quick stop for a bite to eat that is very reasonable and great priced drinks!< /Review>

Two words: Awesome service! They take care of all the COVID19 precautions, you feel very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and the food, just perfect: portions & taste.

As soon as they give you your table they ask you if you need the vegetarian/gluten-free menu :) I had the jungle Tofu bawl and my friend the Hula burger. It's a shame that the place is far away from my house. You definitely won't regret going there!</Review>

The service was just outstanding.  You can tell the staff care about the customers' experience.  The food was delicious and the drinks strong.   The place was very clean too.  Just remember to move your car 150 feet every hour, or you will get a ticket from the City of Monterey.</text>

Extremely long wait (very busy night) but they offered us free appetizers.  The space is small and I wouldn't recommend it for wheelchair users as a result.  Yes, they will accommodate wheelchairs, but I personally would advise a larger restaurant.  The staff are AWESOME!  Very friendly and helpful.  Food is good.  So if you're able to eat here on a day/time that is not overtly busy, then you will probably enjoy yourself.< /text>

My daughter chose this place for our dinner tonight.  We went in hungry and left stuffed!  Delicious food with large entree portions.

Started out with the abalone calamari and it was delicious.  The seared ahi wontons were yummy.  These were appetizers/pupus.  Both great choices.

The entrees were absolutely delicious and the portions HUGE!  I had the Ahi Tuna Bowl and it came in a large bowl, along with my daughters Kingston crab curry. What a unique flavor- Yum!  My son had the jerk pork.  Perfectly cooked with the right texture.  The Kalbi ribs my other daughter had was flavorful and very soft, not hard like some places.  To top off the entrees, my wife had the Fish soup and it was HUGE!  I swear after we passed the bowl around with all the members of the family, there was still some leftover that would probably last another meals worth.

We finished off the evening with the most awesome pies.  Do not leave without having a piece of the lilikoi Rita Pie on a Graham cracker.  That pretty much finished off my evening to the last piece.  Our waiter Marcus was very attentive and polite and the ladies that helped out were polite as well.  We're coming back again here for sure in the future!!</Text>

<Review>Went in there they said they would seat us right away then grabbed our kids out of the car and all of a sudden 2 minutes later they are booked on reservations all day and can only do carry out. Don’t support this establishment. Will never eat here.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rating>

It was Happy Hour so the place became full shortly after we got there but it's a very cozy place so it wasn't a big deal. They keep the doors open so the breeze felt amazing. My husband ordered the wings off the HH menu, they were only ~$6 for like 10. I was impressed by the quantity and the waitress actually came by to let me know they were GF which meant I could have them too! That made me really happy and the wings were seriously delicious, I never eat or like wings! Husband also got the bao sliders & egg rolls which were much smaller portions but he liked them. I ordered the calamari steak sandwich, once the waitress brought it out I realized there was a small issue but they took care of it and brought me a new one with apologies. That sandwich was some of the best seafood I've ever had! I want to eat it every day, and the gluten free bread was the best I've ever had. I got mine without the pesto since it has dairy in it but I didn't feel it was missing a thing. I also got the Hula sauce on the side as recommended by the waitress. I would buy that stuff by the pound if I could! It was so amazing with my sweet potato fries. I have saved this place in my Maps and cannot wait to go back!</Review><Response>None< /Response>< username>

<time>1531070807009< /time><Rating>5</Rating><text>If you are looking for Hawaiian, then this is the obvious choice around these parts. Got the Kalbi Korean style ribs and accidentally ordering off the gluten free menu the Jawaiian Jerked style chicken which turned out to not be gluten free because the waiter asked!

Both Entrees were awesome. The jerked chicken came with a spicy curry that was the perfect compliment to everything on the plate! And the ribs came with an unnecessary sweeter BBQ sauce to dip because they were already marinated and juicy.

And of course, one cannot call a proper Hawaiian restaurant a proper Hawaiian restaurant unless they can serve a decent Maitai... and Hula's delivers!

Oh and PS they had D lish OUS jalapeno bacon mac and cheese appetizer! Get it! Get it now! So good!  It comes out in a small oven dish with barely burnt cheese on the top and real chopped jalapeno and bacon in a real cheddar cheese melt.< /text>< Pics>

Was on hold for 12.5 minutes to try and place a pick up order, only to be told they are very busy.  It is disappointing of Hula's and their management because employement is low and they can add some people to their staff in order to prevent this curbside issue.< /text>

The pork sandwich was great, pork was juicy and the coleslaw on top was delicious. The pork tacos we're good as well. Try the sweet potato fries, they are excellent, and served with a ginger soy dipping sauce.</Text>< pictures>

Happy hour is 5-6pm $6 tiki drinks, $6 select apps.  Ahi tuna and seaweed good, coconut shrimp rolls are good but 🍤 is steamed with Coconut inside not the battered coconut shrimp you're used to.  Best drinks dark and stormy, blood orange martini.  Ordered chicken tacos... fantastic as is edamame hummus.  For dessert lilikoi pie is the best dessert ever.  If you like key lime pie this is a fantastic twist.<//text>

<Text>Two words: Awesome service! They take care of all the COVID19 precautions, you feel very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and the food, just perfect: portions & taste.

As soon as they give you your table they ask you if you need the vegetarian/gluten-free menu :) I had the jungle Tofu bawl and my friend the Hula burger. It's a shame that the place is far away from my house. You definitely won't regret going there!<//Text><rating>5</rating><Time>1594666393524</Time><Name>Fatima Saldivar< /Name><Response>None< /Response><userid>117340552039216788155<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Some of the best Carribean food I have ever had.  The service was top notch. Our server, Spencer, was awesome and kept joking around with our kids and made it a more enjoyable experience.  I had the Carribean jerk chicken which was awesome!!  The Hulu pie is a must for dessert!!  Highly recommend if you are in the area!!!</text>

Was on hold for 12.5 minutes to try and place a pick up order, only to be told they are very busy.  It is disappointing of Hula's and their management because employement is low and they can add some people to their staff in order to prevent this curbside issue.</Text>

Jammed packed but everyone was super nice. Great happy hour deals on food and drinks. The spicy edemame was great but be careful, very spicy. Was a fun stop on our bar and restaurant hopping excursion in Monterey.<//review>

This is a great place to eat in Monterey if you have food allergies. Our server Devin was amazing. He wrote down our list of allergens, knew the ingredients of our food options,  and double checked eveeythjng with the chef. It was a great experience. There were many options for us to choose from despite our list of allergies.</review>

Weve enjoyed take out and outdoor dining in the past few months and this remains one of our favorite local restaurants. Their service continues to be top notch.

I have literally had everything on the menu, but the best still remains the blackened ahi sandwich with side arugula salad. My wife swears by the vegetarian big sur burger. We both agree that nothing beats the spicy edamame app. It is perfectly charred edamame (shelled) tossed with salt and diced Serrano peppers. Easily washed down with one of many tiki drinks (lilikoi marg or double mai tai being my top).< /Text>< user>

Well, food is so so. Ordered Fish taco for lunch, fish was not even that fresh. If u want good seafood, here is definitely not the good choice.< /Review>

<text>This is one of the best places I've been to, absolutely loved it. The wait was worth waiting for. If you have a chance too stop here to eat definitely wait for the afternoon eat out in the back it was a great experience for my family and i. The food was very tasteful and waiters were great. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's around the area or who is going that way for a trip. Loved it.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Yum, recommendation from a friend did not disappoint. Lanai seating is available, or they will come take your order at the front entrance for to go. Blackened ahi caesar was delicious (especially the ahi itself).< /review>

I really like this place. It is a great place and has a great little back patio. And the food is outstanding. Everyone was very pleasant and treated us well. Service was quick, food was good, prices were fair. I will definitely be there a lot, and I will take my friends and family there. I suggest this place strongly.<//text>

I had the shishito peppers as an appetizer and the poke bowl. The peppers were extremely crispy and didn't have much flavor. The poke bowl was pretty good. People rave about this place, so maybe I'll give it another try.<//text>

Great food, great atmosphere! When it's busy it does feel a bit cramped but that's expected all the locals come here!< /Text>

Great place walking distance to the aquarium.  Excellent options for vegans and omnivores.  Drinks are pricey but really good.  Could use a kids menu.< /text>

<Text>This is a fantastic place to grab a bite eat or grab a drink.  This is the most happening place and on this side of Monterey.  So be prepared for a wait.  They have a large menu with plenty of great selections.  I had the Jerk Pork Plate.  It was properly spicy and tasted great.  The hamburger was a bit disappointing but this is not really a place to come for a burger.  They have a large number of tropical and traditional drinks.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

It is a great get a away for the kids. Need some peace to be able to hear your own thoughts?  Want to put them to bed tired and willing?  This park has every conceivable contraption, swing, slide, and activity for them to let off all that pent up energy. It is very busy during the day, so go early.  There are tables to sit at and great spaces for parents to watch on the side without having to be in the thick of it. Most of the activities have plenty of room, so there is not a whole lot of waiting. So go take a break and be your kids' hero by giving them a whole lot to do very no money down.</text>

Very nice, welcoming place, attractive decor with surfboards and island scenes on the walls, good people, good food, full bar. I stopped in for a fish sandwich to go while on the bikes with my son and his friend. Very tasty sandwich. I plan on going back for a sit-down meal and drinks.< /text>

Wonderful staff, delicious food, and thoughtfully laid out gluten free and vegetarian menus in addition to the full menu. Shrimp tacos were amazing, as were the sweet potato fries with ridiculously tasty ginger dipping sauce. The staff was happy to find a place for our stroller and had high chairs available. Wish we lived closer!</text>

Always happy with this local gem! Great prices, and the tiki drinks are fantastic. Bartenders are friendly and Happy hour is awesome. They won't seat your party unless everyone is there so be on time because they fill up quick. The fish is fresh, and the Jamaican jerk is spicy. Can't go wrong here.</Text>

for my fellow "looking for a family friendly establishment" people... this isn't it.  they asked us to pack up the stroller for our sleeping baby to be able to be seated.  it's a small place so i get it but there was outside seating that was ample and we were still asked to pack up our stroller. we just left so couldn't even review the food.  meh.< /text>

<Review>The food was hot and service great in a very full restaurant of patrons! Short wait time for a table. Music tends to be a little on the loud side, but I'm 65. Lol. I had the burger and sweet potato fries, the bun is fresh and must be made tastily right there.</Review><gmapID>0x808de6a9df290119:0x904f306efa704198<//gmapID><rating>5< /rating><user>114407963115961315597< /user><time>1576861420122< /time></record>

It's not that far a walk from Cannery Row so it's a great option if you are in the area. What I loved the most of it is that they have vegan options and great flavor. I would definitely come back.< /Review>< pics>

I think they over promise and under delivered.Very small portions even for 20$ one scoop of rice and same for coleslaw and mac. salad??? Flavors were ok nothing special and just so little food.I have heard their drinks are good.I had dry pulled pork and Kalbi ribs that were mostly bone fat and grissle.2 shrimp egg rolls cut in half for 10 $ not sure if they forgot one or two I still tipped 20 percent because it was to go and I expected so much more.< /text>

<Text>Kitsch Hawaiian restaurant/bar with decent happy hour.  They serve very strong tropical themed drinks for about 6$ during happy hour and there is also a nice set of happy hour appetizers.  Definitely worth a visit.<//Text>< pics>

<name>Michael David</name><Text>Don’t be fooled by this restaurant’s average looking exterior. The food here was absolutely superb. We had a poké bowl and a Hawaiian pork dish which were oh so good. The staff were great too. The portions were very generous, but with lots of veggies and fresh ingredients and so it did not feel unhealthy. The styling is also really fun< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Gmap_id>

Their ceviche is to die for and the tuna tacos are just amazing!! Delicious fish, spicy, fresh flavors, if you find yourself in Monterey skip the pier restaurants and just go to Hula's Island Grill!<//review>< Rating>

<Gmap_id>0x808de6a9df290119:0x904f306efa704198</Gmap_id><Review>Based on the reviews we decided to give it a try. We were very disappointed and dissatisfied with the food. I had a hula burger; it was super overcooked and the fries were absolutely soggy from grease! My Wifes tacos were bland and her beans tasted like the poorest quality canned with mushy Chinese style rice. I'm not sure what happened, maybe because it's Covid time and we ordered at 7PM? I know they close at 8PM, but for the price I was expecting more and this is comming from someone who fasted all day for Ramadan, so typically we're happy with eating anything. We're here in Monterey with an Oceanfront room trying to enjoy 1 night before embarking on essential work... Super bummed to receive this for dinner.<//Review><username>Bremflux</username>< Date>

This fun little Hawaiian grill in Monterey can make me feel like I'm back in Honolulu.  I ordered Duke's luau platter,  which did make me fondly remember the luau at the Hale Koa. The only thing missing was poi. The pulled pork and pineapple was great!
My husband ordered the Kingston curried crab. It was a bit spicy,  but that crab was so good.
I've eaten at Hula's when we lived here before,  but it was my husband's first time here. He enjoyed it, so we'll probably be back.<//text>

Probably the best restaurant in the area. Definitely the best I've tried in Monterey. Prices are a touch high but still worth your $. Good variety of drinks and the menu is large. Normally with a large menu you get food quality degradation, but not the case here. All good. Especially the pork tacos. Happy hour is good here. Not the cheapest in town but at least you know the quality is there.</review>

Great little Polynesian style California bistro, food and drink were tasty but felt rushed by our server.. It was dark and had difficulty reading the small printed menu, food came out very fast and dropped on top of our half eaten apps, the app plates I had to ask to be cleared off our tiny 2-top, to make room for the entree. Check was quickly dropped and I asked if it was ok if we could order desert. It was delish! Paid and out! Cute place tho..</review>

This a very popular restaurant so get there early. Street parking is also sparse. I had sweet potato fries and pulled pork tacos. The pork was incredibly tender. I'm still thinking about it! The sweet potato fries were crisp and stayed that way through the meal. I thought the portion sizes were perfect. Not too much food and not too little. It is a bit dark inside, but it is intimate.< /Review>

This place was AMAZING! The atmosphere, food, and staff were all so wonderful. Drinks were fantastic! Food was so incredibly delicious! I recommend the Kingston Crab Curry...I could seriously eat this every day of my life! The desserts are made in house by their pastry chef, using quality ingredients. Our server, Mikey, was the best! He was so friendly and really went above and beyond to make our dining experience absolutely wonderful. Thank you Hula's! I cannot say enough about how fantastic it was!<//text>

With great priced happy hour drinks that are heavy handed and flavorful, this place has the best pork sliders I have had in a good while. Juicy pork with a dab of coleslaw, cilantro and a jalapeno slice atop perfectly-sized Hawaiian sweet rolls. The only downside was that I had to share them with my wife.<//Review>

<review>The food is good, but if you don't like cilantro, make sure to tell them as it seems to be used as a side dish, rather than for flavoring.

But if you're anything like me, Hula's is uncomfortably crowded (in the evenings) and loud.  I'm not much of a "crowd" person, so that is my only reason for the lower rating.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Staff were very friendly but service is a little slow. Great atmosphere, music was mixed with reggae, funk, and oldies. Food was delicious. The Coconut Shrimp and civiche we're my favorite. The Cajon burger and fries were my son's favorite, yes! Even the fries were seasoned well.  Kona wings were a big let down. The 3 layer Coconut Cheesecake frosting cake is a must try!  Would have given 5 stars but the service was slow. Over all I would definitely return and tell friends and family to visit as well.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

They stop taking reservations by 2/3pm, but my group took a chance anyways. Was about a 45 min wait on a holiday weekend. Sat at the inside waiting area and was tended to for drinks almost immediately which was nice. Food was delicious and comforting. Definitely recommend grabbing dinner here if you want to take a break from all the seafood around the area.<//review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>Easily one of the most exotic restaurants in the region. The food is incredible. It'll definitely be something you haven't tried before. Prices are affordable too. The only thing I didn't like was that the service was slow, but maybe that's because the restaurant was packed. Can't blame them.< /Text></record>

A unique food experience in my life. Been to lots of places, but never Hawaiian Jamaican fusion. Lively surf atmosphere, great food. Get the jawaiian jerk pork with the spicy sauce. So dang good.</text>

Tortillas for my friend’s tacos were old. Service was okay, not good. When we asked to have the check split (only into two), we were told the system was too old. Easily translates into: I’m lazy and don’t feel like it. Won’t be back. Won’t recommend. Go to Zab Zab’s or somewhere else instead.<//Review><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808de6a9df290119:0x904f306efa704198</gmapID><rate>1</rate></record></dataset><record>

Sat at the inside waiting area and was tended to for drinks almost immediately which was nice. Food was delicious and comforting.

The Coconut Shrimp and civiche we're my favorite. The Cajon burger and fries were my son's favorite, yes! Even the fries were seasoned well.  Kona wings were a big let down. The 3 layer Coconut Cheesecake frosting cake is a must try!  Would have given 5 stars but the service was slow. Over all I would definitely return and tell friends and family to visit as well.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808de6a9df290119:0x904f306efa704198<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Not to mention their awesome drinks. If you get a dark and stormy, they put a little umbrella but they mess it up so it looks like it's been through a storm. So cute. It's always pretty busy but I've never waited more than 15 minutes, 20 minutes TOPS for my food.<//Text>< pictures>

Tuesday night is happy hour and all their starters are $6. We made a meal of it! The prawn (shrimp) parcels and the calamari in lime and ginger cream sauce deserves a special mention. The desserts were also absolutely stunning. Try the key lime pie and the passion fruit pie.

The service was excellent too on both nights. Juanita's care and friendly service was definitely a factor in tempting us to visit 2 nights in a row!

Thanks so much for two brilliant evenings and for the most excellent of food experiences! Pity we don't have a Hula's in England!!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

Loved the atmosphere of this place, almost felt like as if I was on an Hawaiian island! Came by on a Saturday night, they are very busy, so be prepared to wait at least 20 to 30 minutes. They do have a bar where you can first grab some drinks or there is a speak easy bar right next door that is owned by them as well.

The food was delicious, we really enjoyed the pulled pork dish. It was juicy and full of flavour! They have a ton of cocktails as well including Blue Hawaiian and Mai Tais. Totally feels like being in Hawaii!</Review>

Can be visited by family and friends but they are totally no no about the kids. They have a philosophy that leads to a serene environment. They totally want to avoid crying toddlers. I really liked that. Most of the time when toddlers cry its kinda never ending. Food and decor are fabulous and they have ample of parking area. I will recommend this place for a date. If you have your dinner before sunset then you can for sure catch a glimpse of the pacific with surrounding mountains. Its wheelchair friendly and you have a lot to do near this restaurant. Dont miss the guy outside the place who performs on the street and sings really nice. While we left they presented a rose to my wife. This really made her evening perfect. I will for sure visit again. Highly recommended.<//Review>< pics>

<review>So good. Actually I didn't care for the sauce on the Jawaiian  pork that much. It was good just not my favorite. The service was great. The food is pricey but pretty unique. You should try it out.

Try the Barbados sauce. It is very spicy and very good.</review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pictures>

Great easy and laid back place with awesome hawaian food and out of this workd cocktails. The sweet potato fries and the pulled pork sandwich are very good. I love spicy food and can tolerate a lot of spice, but this place had a next level hot sauce!</Text>

<Text>This place was great. The food was really good and I would love to talk about it, but I want to focus this review on the service. The hostess was nice and thoughtful, explained the menu and the specials, and gave us compliments and suggestions. She told our server that it was our first time, so she already knew that before approaching us. The server was helpful and friendly, kept the drinks filled - and remembered what they were - and checked on us several times. We didn't feel neglected for not ordering alcohol, as is so often the case. She suggested a dessert she wasn't sure we'd like and she clapped and got excited when we loved it. Three different people thanked us for coming in. We have rarely felt so appreciated and attended at a restaurant. And the food was 5 stars also...<//Text>< pics>

Recommended by a close friend. "Amie". Thank you. This place was kind of "off the beaten path", but still close enough to Cannery Row to allow for a short walk. Parked in the parking garage off of foam street. Walked about one block. All of the employees here really seemed to enjoy and / or like their respective job. Very friendly atmosphere. My wife had the cheeseburger and I had the "grass fed rib eye steak sandwich" . out of the park, so to speak, it was fantastic. Service was awesome. Dan was our waiter. Thank you Dan for recommending the "Wipe out IPA". Would return and would recommend.< /Review>

Staff was obnoxious.  Acted like they were doing us a favor by gracing us with their presence.  Food was meh.  Drinks okay.  Would not split a check for a $300+ bill on a business expense account.  MUST BE A LOCAL TO GET GOOD SERVICE.</Review>

<date>1562910102965</date><rating>2< /rating><review>Ugh. The only disappointing meal of our two week trip. We gave up eating near the water for this place thinking the fun decor and menu would keep our children occupied. Ha! First, this place is tiny, kind of dirty and uncomfortably warm. For a restaurant that’s “good for kids,” there’s no kids menu and the sides/pupu options for them are minimal. We ordered a baked mac and cheese, and a spicy Thai chicken bowl (sans spice) for them and it actually was the best food we ordered. My husband and I shared calamari (squishy and small, redeemed only by the flavorful sauce), shrimp rolls (bland, over cooked and squishy) and the pork tacos (super bland!) The service wasn’t great. It’s like he dismissed our table because we had young children. And then he winked at me when he brought the check.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808de6a9df290119:0x904f306efa704198< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I do not give a 5 star rating often. Hula's is an approachable understated exceptionally fun and flavorful experience. Immediately greeted by Lynnette my wife and I were seated by the window allowing us to see all the excitement of the bar and the servers. We arrived for happy hour and were encouraged to order off that menu. Everything is $6 and the flavors will blow your mind. Had seared ahi tuna, kona wings, abalone calamari and grilled avocado. All were bursting with unique flavors and left me wanting to try another dish. Drinks were spot on, not to light and fantastically balanced. Amazingly none of the cocktails were too sweet, all made with natural fruit juices and allowed to impart genuine flavors of the tropics. The atmosphere was relaxed and fun and the server made us feel welcome and appreciated; even making suggestions and listening to my gluten free rant. I do not get to Monterey often but when I do, Hula's is the place for me. KUDOS HULA'S!<//Text><gmap_id>0x808de6a9df290119:0x904f306efa704198</gmap_id>< Pictures>

This was our second time at Hula's. The food is great! We ordered three items off the happy hour menu, a couple of sides and the Hula pie for the two of us. We had to take some to go. The service is friendly and the atmosphere fun! We'll keep coming back.< /review>

Always great food, always great service. The owner has a philosophy of kindness and sincerity and it reflects in her food and her employees. It is a popular spot for a reason. Expect to wait for a table most nights, especially weekends and tourist season.<//Review>

<text>Positives: Amazing service (some of the best ever), great little Hawaiian themed bar next bar that is perfect for pre dinner drinks, reasonably priced and an expansive menu.

Fantastic food, fantastic people. I dropped a $100 bill on the floor without knowing and a server returned it to me and wouldn’t even take a small cash reward!! Highly recommend Hulas!</Review>

About 2pm, dead in the place, it took over 15 minutes for the waitress to come take my BEVERAGE order. They were all standing around talking by the cash register. Finally I flagged someone and told them I was ready to order. Food was bland. I won't be back. Had the Ahi tacos. Bleck.<//Text>

Came on a recommendation of a local-  found that they had great happy hour drinks, fun back patio lounge/eating section. I would come back for the happy hour snacks- yum! I asked which drinks were not "sweet" but the happy hour choice I made was not for me - still a little too sweet for my taste. I will just be sure to order something different the next time.< /Text>

You will have to sit there with everyone, pick out what you ordered and do the math on the back of the receipt. This ends up eating up a huge chunk of time for bigger groups to figure out how much everyone owes. Lame if you asked me since everyone else does separate checks. If you're there by yourself or a date, fine. Larger parties, not so much.</text>< pics>

My Dr. Funk time drink was delicious as I am a huge fan of Piña Coladas. For my starter, I went the the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls, which did not let me down. Staff was very friendly. My coworker and I arrived early around 3:30 when it wasn't busy, but in less than an hour it got packed pretty quickly.</review>< Date>

I tried their fish wontons very tasty and colorful. Their coconut shrimps were delicious also. service was fast and friendly. The environment was cozy with tiki and surf paraphernalia and videos of surf adventures playing. Can't afford to eat like this every day but wish I could. They offer vegetarian and vegan options but you would need to be cautious If you have celiac disease. I had one of their rice bowls that was vegan and it was spicy, almost like a spicy chili which I enjoyed.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Excellent food, wonderful service.   Pet friendly patio with heaters and couches as well as tables.  Recommend happy hour from 4 to 6.  Had the Hawaiian soup and it was awesome as well as the pulled pork jawaaian style, super spicy and tasty.  Try Hulas, you won't regret!<//review>

Best fish tacos anywhere period. I have dreams about their tacos and I live two thousand miles away. Soft fish that tastes like the grill on crunchy sweet cilantro slaw wrapped in soft white corn tortillas. Perfection. They taste light but are quite filling. I swear I just finished eating two, and I'm not at all hungry, and I'm drooling just thinking about them again.</Review>

Really nice people and pleasant environment but I felt the "pork sandwich" was a dry and rather small for the price. Not to mention if you end up sitting outside in back you have to deal with seagulls and unfortunately one pooped in my wife's lunch but thankfully she was 99% done with the meal. She enjoyed her meal completely but I did not.</Text>

The food was fantastic, the staff was great, and the outdoor seating area was perfect for lunch with the dogs.

That being said, the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I specifically called ahead, twice, to confirm that they had room outside for us (we had the dogs) and to ask if we needed a reservation to hold the outdoor spot. We were told they werent busy and we didn't need a reservation.

It took us less than 5 minutes to get there and upon arrival we were told we had to wait because they didn't have a space open outside.

The rest of the experience was fantastic. Both of our meals were amazing and they even cooked chicken breast for the dogs.

Overall I would go back as it might have been a random bad incident.< /text>

4 stars because it is fun and has great staff. Excellent Hawaiian cocktails (favorite was the Painkiller) perfectly prepared and happy hour pricing is very reasonable.
Not 5 stars because they really glop on some of the sauces on the fish. Highly recommend getting the fish sauces on the side. Some of the sauces are just ok and really kill the dish if they are slathered on top of everything. However, this is easy to avoid so 4 stars.< /Text>

Definitely recommend the Painkiller. Separate vegetarian and gluten free menu. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options. The spicy tofu tacos are really good, Jamaican jerk sauce is pretty spicy. Plantains are very well made as well.</review>

Ceviche is our favorite starter. Jerk pork and various combinations of fresh fish are our favorite entree. Finishing up with pot brownie completed the meal (though pot brownie at Hula's Santa Cruz is better). They are also very accommodating with kids. We're a bit concerned going back with our one year old reading other reviews about kids. Those reviews are NOT true. They welcome kids. They even tried their very best to get is seated soonest possible given that I was holding my baby. Thank you!< /text>

Food mediocre. The place was half empty and we still had to wait 50 minutes to be seated; after we were told it would be 30 minutes. They kept pumping our group to have more drinks. Too noisy to talk to anyone whose ear is more than 1 foot away. Not a dining experience. Across the street is a nail salon, marijuana store, tattoo parlor, and a sex clothing and toy shop.< /Text>

<review>I got here and only had to wait a few minutes  to get a seat. Once seated the waiting began. It was about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. By this point we were all ready to order. Our appetizers took about 30 minutes. For the shrimp rolls it was $6 for four little rolls. The jalapeño macaroni was the same price, and also quiet small. We waited so long to get a refill on drinks that my buddy went and grabbed the pitcher of water himself. There was a hair in the water. One of the waiters kept rubbing his beard and picking his face right before grabbing plates. My food was probably 3 stars, my companions said theirs was much better. The restaurant has a huge patio on the back But inside and outside seating was pretty close quarter. But the garbage service really impacted my opinion of this place.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The food will remind you of all the amazing meals you've had in Africa or the Caribbean. The chef was probably sent by God to bless your tastebuds. If you crave real flavour and actual spice, make this your stop. All that and great drink selection & service< /Text>

<Review>Even though Trip Advisor and Google said it's kid friendly, there is no kids menu, they only have glass cups, no crayons or placemats  and my kids were the only kids there.  I guess if kid friendly is having high chairs then it's kid friendly.

Nice atmosphere, not what I was expecting for kid friendly.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Name>Matt Uskali</Name>< Date>

My wife and I recently drove down from the Bay Area to Carmel for the weekend, and our friends introduced us to Hula's.  We had an absolutely wonderful afternoon, great weather, sitting out on the patio, wonderful food and Blood Orange Martinis, which is probably the best cocktail in the world!   Such a unique place, will definitely be visiting again!</Text>

Their vegan options are really on point. I had the tofu jungle bowl and it was nothing short of amazing. The flavors and different textures were great! I also had the blood orange martini which was super tasty. :)<//Review>

We happened upon this quite by accident, but soon found out it is happy hour on tiki tuesday all day!!

Amazing $6 cocktails and plenty of choice for happy hour eats.

Everything was really tasty, fresh and well presented.  The atmosphere really added to the enjoyment and all the staff were great.

You could tell that everyone in the place was having a good time and you could not help that rubbing off on you. Very happy to give this place a 5 star!

If I wasnt a visitor to the area I would be back. Perhaps next time..< /review>< Pics>

It wzs the first to Hula's Island Grill even though we have one Santa Cruz we go to the one in Monterey.  But it was a really nice place liked the atmosphere of the island theme.  Food was really good and so was the dessert that we took back to are room.</review>

(Some of the best tempeh I've ever had.) Service is always beyond and ambiance is fun and laid back. Peep that giant lava lamp at the bar. :)
Depending on the time of day, there may be a wait. There's a reason for that! Definitely a local and visitor fave.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

- Atmosphere
We arrived less than 5 minutes before the closing time and still enjoyed a great service, they explained they were about to close but did not rush anything.
The food was amazing, I had a "DUKE’S LUAU PORK PLATE" that I loved, my kids had just rice and beans and it also was delicious. I don't recall the name of the desert, it was something with ice-cream and macadamia nuts, really delightful.
Regarding the ambient I liked the decoration and the music.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Hula's is 5 star and everyone knows it - that's why it's so popular with locals and tourists alike. A large and diverse island menu touting excellent food that will leave you beyond stuffed. Our go-tos (and we "go-to" a lot!) are the Jamaican Jerk Pork plate, spicy edamame,  ceviche, tuna bowl, and anything on the happy hour menu. The owner is rad too!</text>< pictures>

The food here was great and they catered to my needs. I am lactose-intolerant and I ask them if the Cajun shrimp had any milk products in it. They change the recipe slightly so I could enjoy it. They also let my friend charge up her phone so that after we were done eating we could keep playing Pokemon GO.<//text>

<review>I can't stop coming here! Between the happy hour specials and the delicious pork, you really can't go wrong. Try the coconut shrimp rolls to start, then follow that with a pork sandwich. Vegetarian? Options like the jungle bowl have you covered.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Came in for happy hour, drinks $6 and $6 apps were good.  Decor was cute but I had secretly hoped my drink would have been served in a tiki glass with some sort of plastic monkey or tissue umbrella😂 maybe happy hour drinks don't come with all the bells and whistles.  Staff was friendly<//Text>

Hula!!!!!! I drive from Santa Barbara just for you. Don't change! You are my everything and it's only been a month since my big sir veggie burger, and I can't come back til next June- which means I need to make it through another 10 months without driving 4 1/2 hours to Monterey for a burger. But that's how much you rock my world. Anyone who has a chance, needs to try this place. Do it! You will not be disappointed.< /text>

The drinks were what I would expect, slightly on the heavy pour but pretty good still. Food was really good, in particular their ceviche which was out of this world!! Best one I have ever had, hands down. They use the morning’s fresh fish, the spices were on point, no fruit... A bit expensive ($14 for a starter portion), but it so good that I will have it every time I visit this place. Service was awesome.< /review>< pictures>

The food is good and the staff are very friendly but I feel they could have shown a bit more honesty in telling us there was no chicken / Jamaican jerk chicken before waiting 45 mins for a table.

<review>Amazing food. My hubby loved the special spicy poke bowl and seaweed salad. My Jawaiian pork plate was wonderful, pork tender and juicy. They served me the sauce on the side along with the soy sauce which was good since the jerk sauce is HOT. Excellent service from everyone and the Maitai is awesome.

Super cool spot, highly recommended for a laid back place. Great food and great crew. Surf moving & decorations make you feel like in Hawaii 😎< /text>

Hula!!!!!! I drive from Santa Barbara just for you. Don't change! You are my everything and it's only been a month since my big sir veggie burger, and I can't come back til next June- which means I need to make it through another 10 months without driving 4 1/2 hours to Monterey for a burger. But that's how much you rock my world. Anyone who has a chance, needs to try this place. Do it! You will not be disappointed.<//text>

Such a good find! Tuesday is all day happy hour which is fantastic! Apps are pretty small but delicious. Loved the Dr. Funk and the Bikini Martini!</Review>

I am not a fan of tiki bars in general. The drinks were what I would expect, slightly on the heavy pour but pretty good still. Food was really good, in particular their ceviche which was out of this world!! Best one I have ever had, hands down. They use the morning’s fresh fish, the spices were on point, no fruit... A bit expensive ($14 for a starter portion), but it so good that I will have it every time I visit this place. Service was awesome.< /text>

Happy hour deals were good, food was delicious and Staff was attentive and fun. I just wish it was a larger  space as seating was a little tight. I would return but would be hesitant to bring my 19 month old.</text>

<text>nice atmosphere friendly service ,pork sandwich was one of the best i ever had and my wife enjoyed the big sur veggie burger .appetizers where good seared Ahi Wontons, wings and a few others for a table of 5 .i would have given 5 stars but with five appetizers already sitting on the table with no appetizer plates,so we had to take them off the table next to us and not everything on the menu was available.< /text><Name>Brian Erb< /Name>< Response>

<text>My son, his girlfriend, and I went to HIG after reading reviews online.  From the moment we walked in....we noticed the workers attentiveness to our wants and needs.  The workers were extremely accommodating and very friendly.  The food....mouth watering!!!!  Burger, best on the planet.  Our waiter, Daniel, went above and beyond to make our visit memorable.  Do not leave Monterey without eating at Hula's Island Grill.  Superb!!!  SUPERB!! :-) ;-) :-)<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Food is pretty decent if overpriced. Drinks are pretty good but no beer on tap. I can't for the life of me figure out why this place is so popular. Much better choices in Monterey.< /text>

Wow! Went to Hula's with my husband and two kids. Got there before happy hour ended and ordered 5 different appetizers and a large Caesar salad. EVERYTHING we ordered was amazing! The waitress accidentally gave us someone's pot stickers, we offered to just pay for them, but she insisted on giving it to us for free. Would definitely recommend!<//Text>

<review>I landed here synchronistically. When I walked in I knew it was my kind of restaurant because of its ambience. It has a good feel, or what they call Good Vibe Tribe.

Had I known there was a place out back to sit I would've chosen that, but I discovered their gorgeous heated outdoor patio after I took a seat at the bar, which was very cool and played surf flicks on tv rather than other sports.

The original server gave me a recommendation upon asking and that is the Kingston Crab Curry pictured here. It well beyond meet my expectations. It's a meal in itself, and another server recommended I try some extra spice (garlic red chili sauce) which was like icing on the cake.

I tried a few different beers, and had I been in the mood for whiskey or sake (or any other spirit) they seemed to have a sufficient variety.

Definitely a must try. Fresh seafood. Tasty beyond belief.</review>< pics>

<text>Always a good time when I go to this place.  Me and some friends from college generally meet in Monterey from time to time, and when we do, we almost always come here.  The ceviche, in particular, is quite good, and the tropical drinks are awesome, too!  Definitely have, and would, recommend this to anyone visiting Monterey.  Great restaurant!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Food is great. If you are having drinks only and maybe appetizers, forget about coming here. Staff will constantly come by your table and clean things out making you feel like you are being rushed out in order to get patrons that actually want to eat. Big groups... forget about it. We wanted to split the bill and our waitress had the audacity to ask us to do the math ourselves and figure out the dollar amount that should be charged to each credit card. Isn't that what advanced technological 21st century restaurant point of sale systems are for? She wasn't kidding either. Very disappointing.</Text>< Pics>

Great deals on delicious pupus and tropical cocktails. Staff is very friendly. Definitely feel the aloha spirit here!</Text>< Pics>

This place is pretty good, if you need to wait to be seated there's a bar next door.
The asthetic is pretty cool.

Service was amazing and all the food we had was sooo well cooked. We had shrimp and pork tacos, fried plantains, mac and cheese and coconut cake. Even had GF dietary restriction and they had a separate menu ready to go. Thumbs up.</Review>

Great food and drinks - love the back patio, too.  Think Polynesian - meets Carribbean - meets cool.</Text>

Favorite restaurant in Pacific Grove...love the jerk pork and plantains. The ceviche appetizer is also great.  Get the jerk sauce on the side though...really spicy.</review>

Even though it was a cold, Monterey night, I and my companions were warm and cozy on the patio. We sat for hours drinking delicious cocktails and eating tasty appetizers without worrying about breaking the bank thanks to the happy hour prices on those things. Propane heating thingies kept us toasty, aided by the courtesy blankets provided in a bin. Our server was friendly, on point, and made great recommendations. I'm used to going to (and enjoying_ the Hula's in Santa Cruz, but the Monterey location is a cut above.<//Text>

We had a fantastic meal (mahi) and the zombies will knock hit socks off! The staff was incredibly attentive, particularly since we were there at a very busy time. Our waiter,  Brian, was great! And Lynette was very friendly--all reasons to go back SOON!< /Text>

Simply put, the best place to go for great Hawaiian food, tiki drinks and a good time! Do yourself a favor and order a double if you get a tiki drink, all the flavors are tasty and alcohol to juice ratio is just right! The staff is super friendly and we're almost always greeted by name.
There are too many delicious items on the menu to call out specific ones here. Everything I have had here is excellent.<//Review>

<Text>This place was jamming and we were told that we would get a table in about a half an hour. After 45 minutes and seeing people get tables before my wife and I did, I went in and saw that they wrote down name, number of people, time in, and wait time announced. I saw that there were people already scribbled out who came after me with the same number of guests. I asked the person taking names about my wife's name being skipped and showed her on the pad. She told me it was written in secret code. WHAT? My wife really wanted to eat there so we waited another 10 minutes and after I saw another couple get seated I figured that the secret code must have been a race issue as a black couple was the only couple that didn't skip over us who came shortly after us.<//Text><userid>100716376454309584283<//userid><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x808de6a9df290119:0x904f306efa704198<//gmapID></record>

We liked Hula's much more before they updated, when they had a much more authentic island vibe. The restaurant now appeals to a trendier crowd.  They still have tasty food and good service, and the long waits for a table are a testament to the popularity of this crowded venue.<//Text>

<Text>Great! Been in the USA for two weeks on holiday and was bored of the same old burger, sea food and fries etc that every place served and can honestly say its best meal I have on these holidays. Very good food and great cocktails. Recommended to all that want something different from the typical slightly bland USA food. But it does seem to get very busy.<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_name>

< review>
I love this place. Everyone is super nice. If TraderJoes had a restaurant it would be this place. I have tried:
ahi tacos, spicy, crispy, big portion. Amazing
Jawaiian jerk pork platter, spicy and AMAZING
Godzilla tots. Try them
Curry tofu bowl, so so good
Jawaiian chicken plate, also amazing.
Steak sandwich: this will change your life

Get the steak sandwich. I am pretty sure it breaks some physical laws it is so good. My life is now in two distinct parts, the time before I tried the steak sandwich and the time after. Evidently the kolbi ribs are even better. I am a little afraid to try them.

Get the spicy edamame. De-licious.

I have now, literally, gone back and lowered the review for other places because Hula's continues to raise the bar. Perfect 7/5 ;-)

They have a vegetarian menu and a gluten free menu.

Tasty drinks also.

Go. Go now.</review>

This place is absolutely fantastic. The service is friendly and attentive, the drinks are well made and well priced (especially during happy hour) and the food is absolutely delicious. Dan, who had served some members of our party before, made the experience all the better with a lively and welcoming attitude - major shout out and gratitude for him. The vegan/vegetarian and gluten free options were a big hit with our V-GF group member, and the cajun burger I had was one of the best burgers I've had in my life. Never visit Monterey without stopping at Hula's - you won't regret it.<//Text>

We were very excited to visit this restaurant for the name alone. They don't take reservations. They were very full but seated us with almost no wait. the decor is very cute and tropical kitschy. Our waitress  was snooty , unfriendly and had a blank stare the few times she actually came to our table. We ordered drinks and appetizers first.  Our drinks came but the appetizers never showed up. When they served our entrees the server tried to remove the dishes meant for our appetizers. When I mention we still had not received the appetizers,  the server walked away. A little while later another guy came to remove the appetizer plates again. This time I sarcastically mentioned that we never received our appetizers .  He then suggested to cancel our appetizers. At that point I was very irritated due to the service and the people next to us, so I said that he should just do what he thought was best for us. A little while after that our waitress finally returned to our table and said she put in the order for appetizers.  They eventually showed up after our meal was finished. No apologies although they did comp the appetizers .

FYI, the seating is very close together so the conversation at the next table will become your conversation, whether you want it to or not. Be forewarn. Once we were seated another group of four women were seated at the table next to us. They were ear piercingly loud and their entire conversation for over an hour consisted of dildos, vibrators, masturbation, and how to avoid having to give it to their husbands or how to get it from strangers without obligation. We also learned that one of the women's husband was a vegan and they were in a fight so she was going to order the ribs because that was going to torture him when she got home. At one point it got quiet. After a few minutes one of the women noted how quiet it was. The other woman noted that it was because they were being quiet. And they all broke out in ear drum rupturing laughter and resumed loud talk about wearing out the batteries of their vibrators. None of which was enjoyable as a parent of two young children having to listen to them. Please people, be aware that there are other human beings around and some are very young. The walk back to our car became awkward when my 8 year asked what is a dildo and what is masturbation?</review>

<text>Fantastic Hawaiian food! It was my first time eating Hawaiian food, and I was not disappointed! The waiters were extremely helpful, taking the initiative to offer us water/drinks while we waited. When I asked if they could substitute tempeh for tofu in my plate, they had no problem whatsoever. The place has a really nice vibe with a small bar with drinks. I love the decorations and the surfer-culture that you feel upon entering. would definetely recommend to anyone!< /text>< Pics>

<review>Amazing. We had a party split between meat eaters and carnivores and we all came away very happy with our food. The cocktails are great and the Mai Tai is probably the nicest I've had anywhere in the world.

On top of the above we were visiting from abroad and had issues calling a taxi/uber, the Godess working there not only allowed my brother in law to use her phone but actually offered to take us back to our hotel in her vehicle herself. That's above and beyond brilliant and I couldn't be more appreciative. Thank you for making a great evening even better.</review>< user_name>

<text>A meal to remember! Great atmosphere albeit, loud and packed. Wonderful service and most importantly, outstanding food!
Started with:
CRISPY COCONUT SHRIMP ROLLS - amazing!
Husband ordered: BLACKENED AHI STEAK SANDWICH - delicious!
I ordered: GRASS FED RIBEYE STEAK SANDWICH - marinated steak, grilled onions, jack cheese, hula sauce. This sandwich was incredible - absolutely scrumptious.
Dessert: Lilikoi (passion fruit) Pie - tastey and refreshing.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><rate>5<//rate><Gmap_id>0x808de6a9df290119:0x904f306efa704198< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

Excellent food, for lunch at great prices, and then we came back during the long happy hour (2-6 PM), when excellent appetizers and Tiki drinks were even a better deal. Super tasty (but not too sweet) Tiki drinks strongly poured at ridiculously low prices, with a tasty low priced appetizer menu during happy hour.< /Review>

Great local spot we have been to as a family more than one. Be careful the jerked food is HOT as is spicy. Not the best for family stop as very much geared to the hip scene. Not to say families are not welcome, just the sense when were there this last visit.< /Review>

< Review>
The food here must have been designed by an artist who sees protein as their canvas and complementary herbal matrimonies as their pallette. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true. The dishes are great! On top of that, our waitress (cute short-haired blonde lady on a Monday) was so passionate about the food and our satisfaction that I would have left happy even if my meal tasted terrible. Luckily it didn’t though.

Have the edamame, even if spicy scares you, and if spicy does scare you, dip it in the black pepper. I promise it adds the perfect amount of smoke and, ironically, salt.</Review>

<Review>Tiki bar style at its finest. Suberb food selection that I can best describe as Asian/Hawaiian/Traditional American all molded into this delicious array of food options. The cocktails are great too (try the Zombie and make it a double!), with a laxed patio area for those warm sunny days, although they do have heaters for those chilly days and nights. If you're looking for something beyond the standard Monterey tourist sand dab and clam chowder options, then definitely check this place out!< /Review>< Pics>

I also thought I had lost my phone in that place while actually it had dropped out of my pocket when I got in the car. I borrowed the owners Iphone to find it on 'where is my iPhone' thanks for that!</Review>< Pictures>

Great meal overall! The sauce on top of the jerk chicken and pork is very spicy - beware! (And I like spicy foods!) Got the mai tai and lilikoi margarita - liked the latter much better because it was quite  tangy and not very sweet. The lilikoi pie on a Graham cracker crust was to die for!</text>

This was my favourite meal and restaurant in CA. We were on holiday from Scotland and dined on the evening the UK voted to leave the EU and as such needed to cheer ourselves up. The maître d' and all the staff made it a most memorable evening.<//Review>

Stop 4 on the roller coaster of fun first I'd 'd like to tell you about the Hawaiian Pork, Shrimp rolls, teriyaki steak, Ahı with seaweed salad and the Hula pie , but we got so busy with the Tiki Happy hour that most of that got wiped out before I could get all the pictures so just take my word when I say pack a coconut bra and a grass skirt and head on over to Monterey's best kept locals secret.</review>

This place never fails us. It can be quite busy but the wait is well worth. Love the small plates and spicy edamame, bacon & jalapeno Mac n cheese and ceviche is our favorite. We ordered lime habanero chicken tacos and a Thai chicken bowl today as main dishes and OMG - so yum!! Servers are quite friendly and polite. Worth the buck you spend !!'<//Text>

Good interesting food, loved the ahii cevechi and shihito peppers were delish.
Big and good cocktails
Friendly staff
Very busy even on a Monday night
Ask to sit in the window, then you don't have to wait to be seated if there's a long signup list<//Text>

Always good, if not great. The food is consistently prepared well, a favorite being the curried crab dish and the edamame apps are to die for.< /Review>

<review>Great food, atmosphere, worth the wait. Favorite restaurant in Monterey, having lived here 3 years it's still #1! Don't miss happy hour, the coconut shrimp, abalone style calamari, mango caesar salad, lemongrass mahi-mahi, jawaiian jerk chicken, big sur burger (as veggie burger it's awesome too)... but you can't really go wrong no matter what you order! Top it off with Dr Funk or one of their other signature cocktails & it's as good if not better than any tiki bar in Hawaii.<//review><Time>1480727124229</Time>< Rate>

Love Duke's Kalua Pork. I always order it with the fried plantains. Scrumptious. And the best mai tai I've ever had!  Fabulous food, friendly staff, awesome decor filled with vintage Hawaiiana that makes you feel as if you're in the islands. (Note: if it's a super hot day - -  which is rare for Monterey - - be warned that there is NO air conditioning. Plenty of fans, though.) Quaint outside patio.  A MUST if you're in Monterey or in Santa Cruz.  Hula's, please open in Santa Barbara!</Text>

Food was great--abalone-style calamari and a Hula-burger, but the waiter was forgetful. Fortunately he had good backup coworkers who covered for him.</Review>

Food was great, but I was served the wrong meal -- it took the server about 10 minutes to realize the mistake.  We will definitely come back again.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) To wait in the next room, very dark, but great atmosphere and delicious cocktails next to the standard. Then get a table outside with radiant heaters, which allowed to sit in the tshirt.
Food in the composition something different, but delicious

(Original)
Zum warten in den nebenraum, sehr dunkel, aber tolle Athmosphäre und leckere Cocktails neben dem Standard . Dann draussen einen Tisch erhalten mit Heizstrahlern, die es erlaubten im tshirt dazusitzen.
Essen in der Zusammenstellung mal etwas anders, aber sehr lecker< /review>

(Translated by Google) Fortunately, there is Google Maps. We didn't want to eat in the hustle and bustle of Cannery Row and looked for something with a good vegetarian selection and then found this great place.
Super friendly service, quick, attentive and helpful. Very good cocktails and incredibly delicious starters (tip: spicy Edamame & Coconut Shrimp Rolls). And at a happy hour price
The Caesars salad unfortunately lacked some sauce and the vegetarian bowl was also a bit dry. Still a visit.

(Original)
Was ein Glück gibt es Google Maps. Wir wollten nicht im Trubel der Cannery Row essen und suchten etwas mit einer guten vegetarischen Auswahl und fanden dann dieses prima Lokal.
Superfreundlicher Service, schnell, aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Sehr gute Cocktails und wahnsinnig leckere Vorspeisen (Tipp: spicy Edamame & Coconut Shrimp Rolls). Dies noch dazu zum Happy Hour Preis.👍
Dem Caesars Salat fehlte leider etwas Soße und auch die vegetarische Bowl war etwas trocken. Trotzdem einen Besuch werd.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Although in a more peripheral area, nice and characteristic place. Hawaiian cuisine, a little spicy. Ribs dinner: very good. Cocktails are also good. It also offers a Happy hour formula with cocktails and some half-price strong dishes. Nice for an alternative evening.

(Original)
Anche se in una zona più periferica, locale carino e caratteristico. Cucina hawaiana, un po' piccantina. Cenato a base di ribs: buonissime. Buoni anche i cocktail. Offre anche una formula Happy hour con cocktail e alcuni piatti forti a metà prezzo. Carino per una serata alternativa.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very good Monterey bar restaurant. It was warmly recommended and I was not disappointed. The burgers are excellent and change from the ones you can eat elsewhere on the coast.

<text>(Translated by Google) The good plan: if you have breakfast late, go for a lunch around 14: 30/15: 00. Double benefit: no queues and "happy hour" rates. We loved the half-cooked tuna with sesame, the raw fish marinated in lemon and coconut milk (ceviche) without forgetting the homemade fries with sweet potato ...

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very good food. I had the Dukes Pork Plate with buttery soft meat that fell apart by itself. In addition Coleslaw and rice. The sauce was perfect too. A very consistent dish. The service was really nice and very fast. Price / performance perfectly justified. A real insider tip on the coastal highway 1.
