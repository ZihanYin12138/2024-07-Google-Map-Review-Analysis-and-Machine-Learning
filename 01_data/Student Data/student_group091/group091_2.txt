<Rate>5</Rate><Text>The lavender honey latte, to me, is their signature drink. It is smooth,  distinct,  and addictive.  Secondly,  I go here weekly to buy my whole beans. The San Jacinto is out of this world. Again smooth and traditional and I love it. Finally everyone is so friendly.  The owner Scott and his wife Annie are the nicest folks you will ever meet and their 3 children are adorable.  Plus the parking is easy, it is easy to get there and they have attractive outdoor furniture so that you can enjoy our beautiful weather near the ocean.< /Text>< pictures>

Update: They moved across the street to a bigger and better spot. Coffee is still great, the addition of pour over is key, and pastries! See the photos from the new spot.

What a great coffee spot! Just in the front of the yoga studio, the coffee and tea here is really great. Finally some good coffee down on this end of San Clemente!< /text>

I have been going to High-Tide almost daily since they have opened and not once have I ever had a bad experience. I am consistently greeted by a sincerely happy and fun crew who are always glad to see me. They always have unique new flavors and delicious pastries. Love High Tide Coffee and recommend highly to any java lovers.< /text>

Here visiting from out of town and I have to say after ordering from High Tide twice, I absolutely love this little gem. I have some dietary restrictions (I am gluten free, egg free, and cane sugar free) AND I can still eat and drink here! Their baked goods are often times paleo and vegan! THAT’S SO RARE. I was able to eat my first donut in MONTHS. Didn’t feel inflamed afterward and that’s phenomenal to me. Not only that, but those options are delicious and so are their drinks. Staff is friendly and it appears that they’re taking COVID seriously. Thank you, High Tide!<//Text>

Probably the best coffee in town and they have the friendliest employees. I work directly across the street and have always been skeptical because I was afraid I'd like the coffee too much. I was right! Not to mention,  the young lady who worked today is there pretty often and she is by far the best. She always has a smile on and a friendly tone. Right now they're only doing online orders and if I've ever heard anyone "sell" new policies or processes.. I heard it the best here. She ensured me it was an easy process, and it was. I was even able to relay that message to a few passer-bys who wanted to try it for the first time. They also ordered online with ease! I will definitely be returning for another iced mocha and amazing service. Please tip your barista's well😊< /review>

If you are looking for a low key coffee shop near the beach this is your stop. When I went I asked a couple questions about the menu and I was extremely impressed at how knowledgeable the employees were. I got the pot of gold and it was delicious. It was exactly what I needed. Great spot to chill</text>

What a great little coffee place!  They have some incredible flavors I had never heard of and WOW did they taste great!  Coffee and tea and some desserts too!  Fun and worth stopping to enjoy a change of pace from the "regular grind"  Yep...pun intended...Enjoy! There is a bakery in the back which only takes online orders, but High Tide Coffee is in the front! It may be a small place, but everyone is happy and friendly and willing to help! thanks<//review>

Cute local coffee destination. The employees are very friendly and the coffee is fantastic. I had their signature orange blossom mocha and was able to customize decaf and coconut milk. The baked goods also looked delicious as they have a bakery inside!< /text>

Nice place to stop for coffee and a snack in San Clemente. Changed to five stars after a Monday morning visit driving from LA to SD. Great, cheerful service, great coffee and delicious muffin for the road.</Text>

Run by true wizards of coffee making, their cold brew is the best I've ever tasted with a blend of coffee beans that creates a deep and delicious flavor profile. I'd also highly recommend the rose coffee if you want an absolutely refreshing cup of coffee with pleasant and relaxing aroma of roses combined with a calming hint of rose flavor to the end of each sip. There are delicious fresh pastries in the mornings too (they go quick though). If having incredible coffee wasn't enough the owners are two of the most genuinely nice people I've met and all of their staff are wonderful. Its a pleasure to come in enjoy a pastry, coffee, and chat to start the morning off feeling good.< /text>

<review>This place has great coffee with a lot of unique latte style drinks. The gluten-free and paleo pastries are also top notch and are truly the reason that I come here. The star deduction is for their hours of operation and the lack of AC. They open at 7am, which discludes those of us who commute on the weekdays... even 645 would help. The lack of AC or some sort of fan makes it incredibly hot in that little space. I'd gladly change my rating if these 2 things change.< /review>< Pics>

If you want to drink the most delicious coffee and support a wonderful new local business, head over to High Tide Coffee and treat yourself! Yes it's inside a yoga studio, no you don't have to feel guilty if you just go there for the coffee. Try the lavender honey latte. You won't be disappointed!</Review>

Always served with a smile and a chat - it's fun to catch up with the High Tide crew, enjoy a DELICIOUS latte with flavors made by hand, and pick up a bag of beans for the rest of the week.

This new spot is a great alternative to other busier coffee shops on the area. I'm not a coffee person, but am in love with their chai lattes and other unique options.
The shop owners are also so pleasant to talk to while they make your drink--they seem to care about their customers.
Looking forward to going back very soon.</review>

By far my favorite coffee shop in San Clemente. The coffee is very robust and delicious. I’ve tried both regular lattes and a couple of their specialty lattes. I find that a lot of “specialty” flavored coffees are far too sweet, but High Tide’s are not at all sickly overpowering.  The specialty flavors accentuate  the coffee instead of covering up the taste. Their chai and specialty chai are also very delicious. Looking forward to my next latte!< /text>

<Review>Great roast! I had a cappuccino and an almond croissant. The croissant was outstanding. The cappuccino was great. Milk was frothed with a little  too big of bubbles and it was brewed at a little too high of a temperature in my amateur opinion, but still very good. And, as I said, the roast was outstanding. It's in the Bread Gallery place, and unfortunately has retained their hours of operation: closed at 2 instead of 6 like most other third wave coffee spots in south OC. I.e., you can't grab a coffee after work, so you'll have to make a point to remember to check it out on an off day or a weekend. However, it's definitely worth it. The staff was super friendly. So stoked to have this spot open!

UPDATE: we are now regulars at this place. Best in South OC!<//Review><Date>1562984782276< /Date>< GmapID>

We pay a premium to the growers to ensure there is no question in quality and to guarantee that the farm workers are paid a livable wage from the start. Each batch is selected from the top tier of each harvest, so you can always know that you are receiving the best possible cup.\n\nAlthough this process costs us more, we have established a high-bar standard for the coffee that goes out our door and we know our customers appreciate the care we put into cultivating that flavor and quality consistency.\n\nThanks again, hope to see you soon!'}<//Response>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Grew up in Brentwood enjoying these delicious bagels on a regular basis. Was so excited to learn they launched a shipping program! Even though I now live in Bagel Heaven (NJ), I missed my Willy’s bagels! Ordered two dozen and they are just as fantastic as I remembered! Held up great on their journey across the country! Even had a few NJ folks taste test and they were shocked they weren’t fresh from the local bagel shop, and even more surprised they came from CA!<//text><user>106021169786156520473< /user>< resp>

Second time going to this place the owner was rude to the customers I figured first time maybe he was tired bad day I was wrong. My 15year old daughter notice it quick the way he treated a gentleman picking up he’s drinks and bagels he literally thru him the cup holder gave him he’s order like he was mad at him not polite or professional at all.I was there long enough to know I’m Not going back. Bagels where great! service not at all.< /review>

Their bagels are always fresh and their food and smoothies are always delicious. They are celebrating 25 years in Brentwood and arrived just after I started working for the school district.  The owners are amazing and their sons are always friendly and personable. If you haven't had a chance, check them out. You won't regret it.</text>

Great bagels and bagel sandwiches. The best bagel sandwich that I've ever had. Fast and very pleasant wait staff. A variety of hot teas and coffees. Many tables inside and out on patio. I will definitely be returning for more bagel sandwiches!< /text>

Great food, great coffee, family owned. Ryan is super personable and keeps his staff well trained and polite. My family's go-to for bagels in Brentwood. My wife usually gets a breakfast bagel sandwich. There are a ton of spread and sandwich options to shake things up every time you go.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>We stopped in for a quick bite while my car was being repaired. I had the onion bagel with lox which was loaded with with veggies. The bagel sandwich and coffee was excellent. The only downside is that this place has lots of business and it took about 10 minutes or so to get our food. But there was plenty of outdoor seating and it wasn't a big deal. Parking can also be an issue.<//Review>< date>

Ryan is always friendly, as are his staff. It's the Cheers of breakfast spots! Food is always great, even though I am a creature of habit. I highly recommend the Bacon swiss breakfast bagel with bacon. Back it up with a French toast bagel with your favorite cream cheese or like me, butter.</Text>

Always a fun place to eat. Love the Asiago bagel! Service is awesome, friendly, food is really good, & they have outside seating which is so good!  Support your local stores, especially Willy's Bagels. They are great!!<//text>

I order the pastrami on cheesy garlic bagel and it was so cheap for 6.75 dollars I got home and there was only 1 pieces of pastrami . I always go here and the owner the very talk guy is so nice but it is so different when he is not here. I can say they are a little mean. Let's see next time.<//Review>

I come here often & I’m usually very satisfied but today I came in & there were just two girls working I don’t believe the manager was in but I wasnt even greeted & after about 5 mins the girl asked if I was ready then I ordered 2 medium coffees & when they were ready I asked what size they were cause they looked like the small I ordered just two days ago ... very disappointed & will not be going back for a while<//Review>

< Review>
As someone who is a serious chocolaholic, I'm always on the lookout for the best chocolate drinks or desserts. I think Starbuck's Mocha Frapp is pretty good, esp. if you request an additional pump (or half pump) of mocha (chocolate) And Peet's has a Mocha Javiva which can be good and isn't too coffee-strong. But then I discovered Willy's Mocha Mania. It's a sensational smoothie that uses nonfat yogurt (that I can't taste), chocolate, coffee and whatever secret ingredients it has. The manager told me that it's been around for 20 years. No surprise. I also like Willy's version of a Creamsicle (orange/vanilla smoothie) but for chocolaholics the Mocha Mania is IT. The staff are very friendly at the place, helped no doubt by my being a familiar customer with a serious Mocha Mania addiction. They're very sympathetic to that.<//Review>

If you want a thorough, knowledgeable, and kind Dr, go to Dr. Biegel.  She's an awesome Dr and you'll find that out on your first visit...She is direct and shoots straight.  No BS with her!

I’m going to be mature and honest here because I want anyone who is seeking a new primary care to be careful as their health and life ultimately depend on it. Don’t choose this clinic. I know the medical field enough to know that this clinic is more focused on money than they are for their patients. They take too long to find out the most minor things like prescriptions, and any questions you have will not be answered till hours later. Even the urgent care I went to had paid more attention to me than this clinic which is my primary care and this says a lot. I am simply advising that if you are looking for a pcp, don’t choose it here. I was open minded and chose mine here but deeply regret it now. They of course will probably reply to this pretending to care and whatnot but if only they put that much care to their patients, they’d be somewhat compatible.</Review>

Sarah Lopez was simply amazing to work with, and I felt like she genuinely cared that I receive the medicine I needed. She made me felt taken care of - which is an art form lost on most providers.

Sarah, thank you from the bottom of my heart.<//Text>< Pics>

First of all, let me begin by saying that everyone's experience is unique to their own. I have read comments over comments of variety of ratings. I am posting my review due to my experience with Dr. Biegel and her staff. I have been seeing Dr. Biegel for over 3 years now. In the beginning it was hard for me to trust and believe in Dr. Biegel or doctors in general. I became too quick in becoming upset over a lack of knowledge and understanding on my part. I felt so ashamed and guilty for the things I said in a past review. I was a disgruntled patient for no reason based on lack of facts. They were just based on fear. Dr. Biegel has been THE ONLY ONE in my lifetime of seeing doctors that has been able to find out that I had an autoimmune disease. I have been to so many doctors and not one was able to explain  why I was feeling so sick. It took some time, but she made the time. She ran tests and tests until she found the problem. When I heard what I had I freaked out. I was so scared because I didn't know what it was I had. I didn't even give her a chance to treat me and I left. I no longer wanted to be her patient, I had accused her of not doing her job right. I was so unfair to her. She had always been so gracious to me. I eventually asked for her forgiveness and again being so gracious she forgave me and accepted me as a patient again. We had a good conversation and she said she would treat me. She is  absolutely such a beautiful human being. She has treated me again for other symptoms that were causing more issues. She is an Angel! She is more than just a doctor. She truly truly cares for her patients. I know that she's busy and has her nurse practitioners see us sometimes, but she is always there. All one has to do is ask nicely if she's available. If not, then make sure when your're making the appointment you ask to see her. Her staff is awesome too. Ismael is always really nice to me. I'm still getting to know the nurse practitioners. Dr. Biegel makes an effort to help make you feel better. She tries as hard as she can because she cares. I left on Thursday with so much hope. She literally helped me turn my blues around. I started taking the medication she prescribed and I have been feeling really good. I trust her with my life and even if she may have to try other solutions to help me heal she makes an effort to help me feel better. Doctors are supposed to look for what works best for you.  I recommend her definitely. I am a real patient with real health problems. She's the best. I love Dr. Biegel.</text>

<review>I was a patient of Dr. Biegel 6 years ago, I left because one day they forgot me in a supply room they put me for my appt.  It was already 5:00 p.m. when I heard people leaving saying good bye, I went outside, likely I found a lady on the hallway, she asked me who was I, and what was I doing there?  I said I'm a patient waiting for the Dr.  However; I got so mad I fired them.  Sometimes I saw Dr. Biegel her self, but mostly it was a MD different one all the times.  Anyways since I work at a place where they know her, one day her husband called in rgds to svc. we started talking about Dr. Susan, I told him about my situation in the past because he asked how come I don't go to her anymore, he promised I'll see her personally, and thing had change, but honestly I think it's worse, I came back in October 2020, never saw Dr. Biegel, the nurse that help the Doctor, was very rude, and told she wanted to be transparent and told me that Dr. Biegel was now a surgeon, and probably I was not going to see her ever, and if I was okay with that then stay with them, but in if not then I can take a decision, I went 3 times, saw an Asian Dr. then a Hispanic Lady Dr. that was very though specially when she did a gynecology exam.
And every time I called was put on hold for 20 to 30 min.  Dr. Biegel does not know what is going on with her staff at the office, it seems to be that everyone is a boss there.  I received a bill know for an annual depression screening ?? I don't even know what that is for, I was never there for a depression?  I asked the Secretary there if my physical exam was free because it should be, she said no, so I paid, I thought that because it was the 1st time I was there, then I went back for my results, I asked her again if my second visit was at no charge, she said no I had to pay my co-pay because the Dr. had to read the test??  but know I get a bill?  I called the office this morning, they put me on hold for 20 min. I'm at work, so I had to hung up.  Very upset< /review><Resp>None<//Resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>1</rating>< userid>

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!
Switched to dr Susan beagel thinking they’d be good. Don’t fall for the good reviews. DIRTY OFFICE, staff VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, you don’t even get to see the doctor, it’s whoever’s available. We missed work and we didn’t even end up being seen because of the way they scheduled our appointments.</review>

<text>Dr. Biegel is by far the best Doctor my wife and myself have had for our health/medical needs.   Her staff is very friendly and courteous.  Dr. Biegel has even replied to my texts over the weekend when I had a sinus infection and had her office call the pharmacy on Sunday for me to pickup a prescription!

I have nothing but good things to say about her and her practice.  I recommend Dr. Biegel to anyone looking for a primary care physician.<//text><userid>113591626905545703211<//userid><pics>None</pics>< GmapID>

Run from this doctor! My family insisted that Dr. Biegel stop treating our mother because she was killing her with prescriptions. Every time a drug had side effects she just prescribed more drugs-40 total. Dr. Biegel’s comment to our mother upon leaving was “I will miss you-we had such good conversations”. I told Dr. Biegel “you may have had good conversations but you didn’t give her good care”.</Text>

I've been very pleased with the Dr. and her staff since transferring to this office last month.  My appointments have been promptly handled, the staff have been friendly, and the service personable.  I saw the Dr. both times in addition to the support team doing most of the functional work.  I commend the office for their apprentice program with local students, and I was grateful for the waiving of a co-pay to have some sutures removed.  While there seem to be quite a few recent negatives, perhaps its because people with positive experiences don't write as much - thus I felt compelled to do so.</Text>

Make an appointment, show up on time and wait, then wait some more. 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, an hour. Bring entertainment, bring lunch, bring paitence, but don't bring the kids unless you want to entertain them during your long wait. When you do see the medical staff (DR, PA, MA) their services are the best (and depending on your opinion, worth the wait). I often am assisted by Ron a staff MA and he is always more than helpful. He is always my most excellent liason to Dr Biegel.<//review>

My name is Robert Aguilar. On my first visit to Dr. Biegel over 5 year's ago was when I met Ishmael. On that day and ever day since when I am seen by him he has been professional, kind, polite, respectful and friendly. Ishmael is a good egg. He performs his job above and beyond the call of duty.Thank you and God bless you Dr. Biegel and Ishmael.  Bravo!  Encore!  Encore!< /Review>

Any time I needed an appointment or a refill on my medication the staff rapidly let's my doctor know, and the staff promptly calls me back with an answer.

I want to recommend Dr Susan Biegle. She offers the most proactive preventative services of any physician I have ever seen. As a concerned Osteoporosis  patient she authorized a bone scan done right in the office. She provided the best option for my treatment and I have full confidence in her care.

<review>This doctor office is horrible. You call to make an appointment and they give you a date but does not properly put it in the books. Sometimes you cannot even get in for weeks on end. Then when you call them on there mistakes they want to mistreat you and make false accusations because my daughter took the paper out of the ladies hands. Very horrible. I just witness two office people that were very unprofessional one even stated she was the office manager (o lord) ,  about there positions over a doctors note. We reported them to IEHP and also talked with the police. I cannot believe this place can harasse a 19year old who is trying to get a physical, check diabetes and high blood pressure. This place is such a joke!!!
Also someone gets on website apologising, there is no need because your office mistreated my daughter and that is just wrong!!!! You are over booked and big mistakes are made because your office over books  people on purpose and things are never completed or misdiagnosed or just never handled. People wonder why young adults have attitudes or talk to them crazy, well here is many reasons why.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< rate>

Your daughter, the patient, had an appointment for 4/11/19 but she showed up on the wrong day, 4/9/19.  She has a history with our office of having appointments which were scheduled for 1/16/19, 2/11/19, and 4/5/19 where she simply did not show up for her appointments without so much as a courtesy call to our office so that we could fit another sick patient in.\n\nSo, she came on the wrong day but we still attempted to help her until she started being rude to my office manager who was summoned to answer a question for her; she started repeatedly cursing at all my staff present including Michele, Kelly, and Oralia.  Unlike what you wrote, WE had to call the police on HER because she was being so aggressive, loud, and disruptive for the rest of our patients.\n\nYour daughter then proceeded to shove my office manager and then yanked multiple pieces of paper containing patient’s private information out of Oralia’s hand that didn’t even belong to her! This is completely unacceptable behavior!\n\nWhen the police was parking your daughter was heard to say “ I can’t afford to be here” and she then threw the papers into the shrubs outside our building and jumped into her car and left, while my office manager took down her license plate.  My office staff made a police report regarding your daughter and also reported this incident with your daughter to IEHP.\n\nApparently your daughter told you a bunch of lies and that is why you have your facts wrong:  your daughter was not the one who was abused and mistreated- my office staff was.  I DO wonder why your daughter has her attitudes- but she is your daughter and I’m sure you know much more than we do about that.\n\nOn the other hand, if you would like to call me directly, I would be happy to listen to all your ideas or better yet, you are welcome to set an appointment to meet with me personally! You could let me know specifically  all the ways you think I could improve my practice! One thing I have noticed is that people who are angry about their lives and situations tend to take it out on others from behind a computer screen, and to blame others for their own mistakes.  I think in today’s language it is called bullying.  We will be waiting for your call.  We are here daily taking care of patients who want to get well from 8 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday.\n\nWith all sincerity,\n\nDr. Susan Biegel'}<//resp></record></dataset><record>

The negative reviews I've seen don't remotely compare to the service I've received. True, you may not see Dr. Biegel every visit, but her staff is top notch. My last visit involved a lot, and it was a Monday morning. Jackie and Gus made every effort to help me despite the flurry of appointments they had. They did their best, and at the end, I was satisfied that my health issues were both a concern to them, and properly addressed.</Text>

{'time': 1553591615213, 'text': 'Hi Zelena,\n\nI can certainly understand you being upset about being fired.  Sometimes we want to blame someone outside of ourselves to deflect the pain we feel when we get rejected, so you wrote a review of my office to once again, put the blame outside of yourself.\n\nMy assessment of the situation is that, from the beginning of your employment you pretty much had your own ideas as to how the phone center should be run.  You have very strong opinions as to how everyone around you should conduct themselves. You also have a very strong personality.  You may make a good lead someday, and maybe that is what you are cut out for.  What I find is that a good leader needs to be a good follower first, and that you were not.\nWe found that you did not fit well with the phone center team or in that environment at all.\n\nThe best of luck to you!\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Susan Biegel'}< /Response>
<Name>Zelena Herdocia</Name>< review>
I was a employee here at Susan Biegel's office and was recently let go a couple days after I complained my concerns to the office manager Oralia about how I was being treated by the supervisors. I was being treated so rude and never got proper training because it is so busy and I would get constant attitude when asking questions. There's allot more I can say about how I was treated but the more important thing I brought to the office managers attention was how the patients are being treated.

If you are a current or previous patient at this office then you know exactly what I am talking about. I told the office manager I was trained in school to give the best patient care, be honest, and treat them with the respect and attention they deserve and that was not how the office was being ran in my department. She stated she would talk to the employees but I seen no change or follow ups with me (except being given more attitude). Shortly after that I was being given "verbal warning write ups" for reasons that were obviously to just "get rid of me" because I didn't work how they did.
After refusing to sign the last verbal write up because it was false information i was then told I was being let go.
I was only a employee for 2 and a 1/2 weeks, I was still in the training process but I was given 4 verbal write up that were not true or exaggerated within 4 days after my complaint.
After being told I was being let go I questioned them and told the office manager how I felt and I would like copies of everything, and I asked for proof of the complaint I gave. She told me everything I said was verbal and she did not have to give me proof of anything. I then went to Dr Biegel who acted like she could care less but she told Oralia to initial a written statement by me of what I told her that day. I sat for 10min and wrote out the conversation we had, took it to Oralia for her to sign, she read my statement and agreed what I wrote was true and then she laughed and said she doesn't have to sign anything because "she doesn't want to". I then again went to Dr Biegel stating what happened and she changed her mind and said
"I don't know about any legal stuff and how this can effect the office so she doesn't need to sign anything".
Then some man I never seen before came and told me the conversation was over and I needed to leave.
I could not believe what just happened... I was in shock and so upset.
The last thing I said to them was I am going to report them to state board for being wrongfully terminates and HIPAA for how the office is being ran.
I have much more inside information that's going on there then they know and I will get justice not only for myself but for the patients.
I am writing here on yelp because the doctor pays her employees to get good yelp reviews for her so I know she will see this and I hope she can sleep at night knowing how she is allowing her office to be ran and knowing they fired me for no reason except I didn't work the way they do.
Dr Biegel I hope your conscious is okay knowing you stood there and let me be treated the way I was treated by your office manager and supervisors yesterday. You have a few good employees there but you really need to be more involved and watch closely what is going on because you will suffer from it in the long run since as you said "you own the place".</review>

<Text>Had an issue with an FAA flight physical. Made several phone calls to quite a few locations and even went to my primary care doc with zero luck. Found her online, called her office and spoke to an extremely competent person on the phone who immediately understood the issue. Made a next day appointment and my problem was solved. Explained my issue to her and she checked me out and fixed the issue. Thank you!</Text>< pics>

<Text>I came here because I was having stomach pain and I've had h-pilory in the past so I knew it's what I had again. I was tested and after not hearing from them I called about 5 times after being told results were in but doctor needed to look at them. Finally they call and said doctor cannot treat me because I am 5 months pregnant to go to my ob gyn because she did not know what was safe( why not tell me this to begin with). After me getting upset they agree to give me some medication (wrong one). So I call my OB and she prescribed me medication. 1 and a half month later I get a call that blood work is in and I have high cholesterol and low vitamin d  which high cholesterol is normal while pregnant any doctor should know that. So I told them that I needed to be retested for h-pilory and they said they would ask the doctor well 2 weeks later and have not heard from this office... doctor  lacks knowledge and professionalism.

< Review>
I called Dr Biegels office a few weeks ago and was pretty upset at the outcome of that call.  I wanted information about what vaccines I needed to travel to Kenya.  I believe the gentleman who answered the phone lied to me several times, including telling me that he was a nurse.  I was so frustrated that I vowed to get another dr and left a bad review on here, (1st one ever).  The following day Cate called and apologized for my experience.  She took the time to hear my concerns and she did some research and helped me find some places to get some of my shots at a cheaper price.  Because of her, I am going to the office tomorrow for other shots.  ONLY because of her.  I'll finish this tomorrow...   : )
Thank you Cate!<//Review>

Went in to get a simple TB test for school and I was waiting there for sooo long! The waiting room waiting wasn't THAT bad, BUT they put me in a tiny room after that and I ended up waiting at least an hour just to see anyone! There's so much more I would like to say however I don't have the time, I would highly NOT RECOMMEND this office!!!</Text>

Dr. Biegel has been my doctor for over 4 years. I have recieved nothing but the best care from her and her staff. The office is great, appointsments are on time and they can handle most situations in house. When I first started with her I was diabetic, but with her help and guidence I no longer require meds, my A1C in normal, I've lost wieight and am feeling great. I highly recommend her.< /text>

I’m sorry I didn’t respond to you sooner:  it had taken me a while to understand the reason why doctors have to deal with social media while also being expected to be there for our patients who are have life threatening illnesses, as well as everyone else who needs or wants their  medical care right now.\n\nI also feel like so many of our bad reviews are either from people who may not even be our patients, and/or disgruntled ex  employees.  We cannot find most of these negative reviewers in our computer records, and these individuals don’t leave any way to contact them either.   In my generation, it was more proper to speak to the management directly if you had a problem with service rather than spread negativity and gossip to others who have nothing to do with the problem or finding a solution.\n\nAnyway, that’s my pet peeve.  I don’t expect to please everyone all the time, and neither will my employees: It’s just not possible.  But we will always try to do our very best/ that is one thing we promise you, our patients.\n\nThank you for listening to one doctor’s rants about social media and modern medicine, and again, I want to thank you for your heartfelt support.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Susan Biegel'}< /resp>
<Text>Dr. Biegel is very respectful, responsive, vigilant and caring. I don't know what more qualities you seek in your primary care physician. She's not perfect and she can't over see every single aspect of every single patient, she's not your mom. She does her part and often times its us the patient that drops the ball but somehow grown people don't wanna take personal responsibility for their own health of all things!<//Text>< UserId.>

I have been coming to Dr. Susan Biegel office now over a year. I have only met with her once. I have requested to see her for medical treatment while booking my appointments via phone. Its never a true medical doctor. Always a student doctor residency. Very disappointing to not see her to establish a trust with her regarding medical treatment. I have requested my concerns about it with her office team & my insurance company and nothing has changed unfortunately.
Struggled with finding a solution since her office is located near my home. After today visit feeling very uncomfortable due to meeting with a student doctor every visit.</Text>

Dr Biegel is a very nice and knowledgeable doctor and her staff is mostly amazing!

<Review>From the time I arrived I felt very unwelcome. I had an appointment, paperwork filled out, my ID and insurance card in hand. The receptionist asked me for the $50 co-pay, and I informed her that I was using one of my 2 visits per year with no co-pay.  She went into the back to discuss it with someone, and returned a few minutes later.  She immediately began to warn me that if I discussed ANYTHING with the doctor regarding any problems I might be having, that it would then be a regular office visit and the $50 co-pay would apply.  I told her that I was there for my annual exam and that I wasn't sick, and she then repeated herself.  I HAVE never been told by ANYONE, let alone a receptionist, what I can and cannot discuss with my doctor! When I was taken to the exam room and Dr. Biegel came in, her first question to her assistant was "why is there no co-pay on this?" I was appalled! My "exam" consisted of her assistant taking my blood pressure twice. All annual exams that I have ever had with other doctors AT LEAST included the doctor listening to my heart and lungs, looking into eyes, nose and ears, testing reflexes etc, along with many questions from the doctor. When she asked me if I had any questions, I told her what her receptionist had told me, she said it was OK to ask questions, which is the only reason I gave her 2 stars instead of 1. Dr. Biegel wanted me to come back in a month to have my blood pressure checked again because it was high......can't imagine why it was high??? Too bad because I was hopeful that I would find a good doctor near where I live.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Everyone knows how difficult it is to find a PMD who not only listens to their patients, but actually knows what they are doing.  I have been coming to this office for 4 years and I absolutely love it.  So thorough.  The guy who complains in the comments below about getting an EKG even though he doesn't need one, is a complete jackass.  You're lucky this doc does simple tests like that, because she could save you from a heart attack by finding a simple arrhythmia and following up on it.  I'd rather have a test come back negative, and have to deal with a busy office, then deal with a really nice PMD who saw me personally but wasn't forward thinking with preventative care and you wake up dead.  They even offer well woman checkups all at the same time, which save you time and money, not having to schedule and pay additional co-pays.  Ive never waited longer than 30-45 minutes in the waiting room.  Her Nurse, Ron, is an angel.  If I got his name wrong, he is a Filipino man 25-35 and does the best assessments, is funny and also is concerned for your well being.  Dr. Biegel's PA or NP Krista, explains things on my individual level, and gives advice on how to improve your overall health.  Dr.  Biegal has an impressive, dynamic team of professionals and I would recommend anyone to this office.  Im not getting paid to say all this, I just really feel blessed to have found this office.  It's busy because its awesome.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1525838469635, 'text': 'Hi Michelle,\n\nThank you so much for taking your personal  time to write your perceptions regarding the care you have received at my office.

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>DR. Biegel is radiant, caring and respectful as is all of her staff.  I was a new patient with an appointment for an FAA exam.  I arrived early to complete any paperwork requirements and was seen immediately. Part of the exam includes a blood pressure check for which I had some concern going in. DR Biegel's office is however very serine, with a spiritual and peaceful atmosphere  making the whole experience very calming.  I will recommend DR. Biegel to all of my friends and family.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Worst doctor in the area.  If you mention the name, other doctors know her, roll their eyes or just shake their head.
The people you will see are nurse practioners not the doctor.  I never saw Dr. Biegel, requested it, promised that next time the appointment would be with a doctor. NEVER HAPPENED.  Poorly run, I agree with the other comment about the unnecessary test and then a bill in the mail for the service.  After requesting test results for 3 months, I had to call my insurance and have them call the doctors office to get my results.
They did not take my blood pressure correctly, even after I told the girl that it could not be that low.  On the third visit and feeling like death, I ask the NP to take it I think it was somewhere around 180/110.
I hope that this information will help someone to make the correct decision, you really need to be your own advocate in this office.  Good luck</Text>

After five years or more of being a patient here I have FINALLY switched doctors.  I am completely done with Dr. Biegels office. It feels like a factory and quantity vs. quality.  The wait time when calling in is always very long 10 minutes or more.  I have seen Biegel maybe once or twice at the most and every time I go to their office there are new PA's, NP's, etc....  It seems there is a very in and out of staff members.  One day I was so frustrated at being on hold I told the staff member on the phone that it was just ridiculous and her response to me was "well we do have over 3000 patients".  I was disappointed to hear that.  I also on several occasions have heard the medical assistance talking about other patients and that is disheartening.  I had a few medical issues at one time and felt as if I was bothering the staff because I was there so much for a period of time, worst feeling ever. I do not recommend Dr. Biegel.< /text>

{'time': 1517596245702, 'text': 'Dear Roxanne,\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to speak to me yesterday. I appreciate your perspective.  My practice surely has grown since 27 years ago when I began in private practice, and if it hadn’t grown I think that would be scary! That would be like going to a restaurant where it’s really empty.  It would be empty for a reason- because the food or the service or something is no good.\n\nClearly the statement by my phone room was inappropriate.  That should never have been said to you, because the number of patients we have is not your problem, it is ours! Our goal is to care for each of our patient’s needs in a compassionate, effective and caring manner and I believe we do that very well.  No business is 100% perfect 100% of the time, and employees can have bad days and moments.  We have worked really hard to improve the wait times on hold for the patients and we are on an awesome trajectory of growth and improvement.  I’m sorry that you decided to move on from my practice when you did because\nwe have already improved and I know you would feel the difference.\n\nAs we spoke, it was identified that you never asked to speak to the supervisor or the manager.\nYou also shared that you felt you could not get in contact with me.  Our manager, supervisors and administrative assistants are here every day and\navailable to take your call.  I can take a phone message to call you back when I can or a letter would also suffice - you can mark it confidential to be read by me, Dr. Biegel, only.\n\nWe provide ample opportunity for you to express\nany issue you might be having.  We welcome both positive and negative feedback, and are able to turn those negative experiences into positives.\nAs discussed with you on the phone, I wasn’t sure why putting a one star review on my google site was your first choice to reach out to us.  I feel it would be more fair to express your concerns to someone at my office, and if it were your business I’m sure you would feel the same.\n\nIf you decide you would like to come back to the practice you would be more than welcome.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Susan Biegel'}<//Resp>

It was my first visit to Susan Biegel’s office and also my last. I went to her for treatment of my previous injuries. She did not treat my injuries, but created additional injuries and then used my previous injuries against me to cover up her malpractice. Both Eunice and Marilyn are her interns, who poked the needle in the wrong direction of my veins causing immense pain and massive blood to run out to the bed, the table, and floors. She did not even come in to rescue me in that crisis conditions. That is how I discovered Eunice and Marilyn are only interns using me for their practices. I would absolutely walk out if she would have told me her staff are only interns. Such enormous pain caused me to cry, fear, and emotional distress. I reported her to the Medical Board. She fabricated fraud using retaliatory and slandering tactics against me to cover up her malpractice even when I have photos for evidences. I agreed with the previous reviews, this MD hired cheap labor to practice medicine for greed to scam money from patients. Patients are at risk with this MD. It was an eye-opener and below the standard of care; I cannot trust her with my health and strongly not recommend this MD to anyone!”< /Text>< Pics>

<text>What a HORRIBLE way to find out whether or not I had cancer

Following a mammogram/ultrasound it was determined that I needed multiple biopsies in both breasts. I was forced to make an appointment/pay a co-pay just to pick up the referral slip.  I repeatedly told staff I only needed the slip. I was kept waiting in reception for nearly 2 hours before throwing a mini fit and ANOTHER Dr. on his way to see his own patients, stopped and made sure that I was seen.

I had an appointment the following week @ 8am with the Dr. to receive my results. The office called the day before the appointment to say the Dr. would not be in until 9:30 that day, so we moved the appointment time.

I arrived, nervous about the results, sat for a bit and then was told my appointment had been made for 2 days later!!! Frustrated, annoyed, and angry I asked the receptionist if she could just print the results for me. I couldn't even look until I was alone in my car. Thank God there was no cancer. I would have been DEVASTATED.

I don't know where the breakdown is. The office staff is WONDERFUL, the Dr. herself is ok, but I always have an unpleasant experience when I have to go there. This is just one of MANY.<//text>< Time>

I haven’t been there but getting a appointment is a big trouble with her. So I just look for someone else.

My Husband spoke to the person who the Doctor said to contact and still the same run around it seems that they have too many patients and can’t acomodate anymore if that’s the case they should not accept new people and give them a hard time to get an appointment with their unnecessary procedures that has been done with the previous doctor and habe the results.</Review><time>1525893767104<//time><Rate>1< /Rate><user_id>108419840559627121269< /user_id><user_name>Adina Mutert< /user_name><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><review>i agree with everything this X employee had to say below in her review and its a shame when you have X employee rating the office they once work for and has nothing good to say about the office.

So here is my experience to add to what the X employee had to say.
Dr. Susan WILL NOT SEE HMO  PATIENTS AND WHEN SHE'S OPEN ON THE WEEKEND IS'T ONLY FOR PPO PATIENTS because if you look up the office information on the website it states that Saturday's appointment are for PPO PATIENTS ONLY EVERY 2ND & 4TH SATURDAY. The staff have been train to continue lying to HMO patients having them thinking they have an appointment with Dr.Susan then when you get to the office you end up seeing that nurse practitioner that NEVER COMBS HER HAIR AND ALWAYS......HAVE ON A WRINKLED DIRTY NURSE JACKET EVERY TIME YOU SEE HER AND  SHE HAS NO IDEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHAT SHE'S DOING ARE WHAT YOUR  APPOINTMENT IS FOR.  It's not right or far the way HMO patients are treated in that office but they continue to  mistreat them over and over again AND THEY DON'T CARE.  iF you are a HMO patient  and have an appointment you we be sent to the rooms that's on the opposite side of the receptionist desk and if you are a PPO patient you are sent to the rooms that located  right behind the receptionist desk which is where Dr. Susan will see the PPO PATIENTS ONLY. If YOU EVERY CALL AND REQUEST FOR Dr. Susan to call you back concerning a health issues you may be  having , GOOD LUCK because you WILL NOT back from her. I keep calling for a  week 1/2 leaving message with her lying staff asking for her call after telling the loose brain receptionist  over and over what my concerns were she finally got tried of me calling and said DR. BEIGEL DO NOT DO PHONE  CALLS TO PATIENTS AND SHE WILL NOT BE RETURNING MY CALL AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE DO FOR HER PATIENTS  NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING ON. ( wish is not surprising to me at all base on the terrible experience I have had with this office. I was so upset at my last appointment to the point where I refuse to see that UN-EXPERIENCE  NURSR PRACTITIONER again so Dr. Susan made me wait...................... 2 1/2 hours just to see her and I was the  LAST PATIENT IN THE OFFICE  alone with one staff member so he could  discharged me when she was finish seeing me, and when she came into  the room to see me she' wasn't happy  at all because I refuse to see her nurse practitioner and requested to see her instead . Needless to say  I was very disappointed in her attitude and spirit as a doctor because it confirm what I had been hearing and seeing all alone when it comes to her office and her not seeing HMO patients period.  I had been to her office 3 others times before for my daughter  appointments and 2 times for my appointments and each time we were told we would see her but the staff was just LYING then when I  got unset the day i did see her  they made me  wait that long.   Some but not all of the staff is VERY RUDE!!!!!!! AND HAS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This office DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PATIENTS INSURANCE CHOICE AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE PATIENTS., INSURANCE IS INSURANCE AND PEOPLE PAID FOR WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF IT. Make no mistake people like this doctor and staff  who live their lives mistreating others WILL still have to stand before God and be judge  and will have to GIVE AN ACCOUNT for their action here on earth. IF I COULD GIVE ZERO..........STARS THAT'S DEFINITELY WHAT IT WOULD BE!!!!!!!!

<response>{'time': 1506102849099, 'text': "Dear Marilyn,\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to write your review.  I saw the review from my my ex employee.  She was fired because of doing illegal activity at my office.  We had to have the police come to the office and we pressed charges on her.  The other thing is, since she was fired, she was also not eligible to collect unemployment which, I'm sure, also made her very angry.  This could have something to do with her writing the review that she did, and in my opinion her review was very, very skewed and unbalanced.\n\nHonestly, in regards to the provider that you saw:  what you described, for me, did not match any of the nurse practitioners that we have on staff and not even any of the students or medical assistants.    I am proud of all of my staff and they are very kind and not rude to the patients.  They bend over backwards for the patients to help them.  I'm not sure about your experience of my staff  lying to you.  It appears we need to have the phone receptionists be more clear to the patients while making the appointments exactly who they will be seeing for a provider.\n\nIn regards to HMO and PPO patients alike I review ALL labs  EVERY day and have my office staff contact both HMO and PPO alike with their lab results, for the more urgent abnormal  results we contact same day or next day and it doesn't matter if it is an HMO or a PPO.\n\nAs owner, administrator, and supervisor over my staff I only truly have  less than 24 appointment slots per day on my schedule where I can book patients.   I have been practicing in Upland for 27 years, and I have patients that have been with me that long.  There is no way I can see every patient that calls my practice, just like a very popular hairdresser, for example, who has been working and has developed a large clientele.  But what I can do is to have excellent staff that can  deliver excellent care to every patient.  That is our goal every day, to make sure every patient gets the best care.\n\nRegarding differences between HMO and PPO patients, first of all we feel all patients deserve the best of care.  There are major differences in HMO vs PPO  insurances, but my goal is to guide my patients to get the best and the most out of their insurance, whatever that may be.\n\nOne of the major differences is that with HMO especially IEHP medical practices are extremely limited in what we can do.  For example, I cannot help my patients with knee or shoulder pain with joint injections on IEHP because they don't allow me to do those in my contract.  With Regal Medical Group, they do allow me to do joint injections, so we look for ways to help patients within what we can do within the bounds of their insurance.  All of this is prearranged by the medical group and is non- negotiable.  HMOs I am contracted with do not contract with providers to provide services to their patients on Saturday or Sunday.  They have contracted with Urgent care centers to do so,\n\nSo, in summary there is a lot that is in the HMO insurance contracts that limits what a physicians office can do, but we live with those limitations and do the best that we can.\nAt Dr. Susan Biegel's office  we strive to help each patient to achieve their highest level of wellness possible.\n\nMarilyn, my office did call you and we were never able to get through.  I invite you to please give the office a call and speak with Cait, our phone room lead, to see what we can do to make things right for you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Susan Biegel"}<//response>< GmapID>

<review>This doctor's office if very unprofessional. While on the phone with them I can hear them talking amongst each other laughing and joking.  The person on the phone sound lost and confused.  She sound as if I  wasting her time. My daughter in law has abnormal test results and that is all she knows.  This doctor is to busy to give her a call with details.  Its going on 3 weeks and no answers.  When I called the clinic to see if they can give my daughter in law a call with her results,  the girl on the phone got  bothered and rushed to get me off the phone.  I work in a medical clinic and I know how things work.  People like that should not be working in the medical care department.  They don't care about people.  I do not recommend this kind of medical clinic to anyone. They just don't care about their patients.<//review>< pics>

Dr. Susan Biegel and her staff are extremely nice individuals. I felt very comfortable with them all, and moreover, this dr.'s office is a clean facility. However, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this Dr.'s office to anyone. This office does not work expeditiously to take care of the needs of their patients. I went in to this office to go be seen about a skin condition. Dr. Biegel nor the other doctor I was seen by could determine what the skin condition was. They said they would put a referral in for me to go to a dermatologist, and they sent me to get lab work. I called Dr. Susan Biegel's office the next day, and they said the lab work came in but the doctor had not reviewed it yet. I called again one week later, and they said the same thing... Week 3, I had to call and be a little more firm with them to get my lab results read to me. After being more assertive with them, they asked if I could make an appointment to go into the office to get my lab results. The same situation occurred with my dermatologist referral. I kept calling to see if my referral went through, and they said to me 3 times (over a time period of three weeks) that my referral was still pending... Still haven't seen a dermatologist, and my skin condition has not yet been diagnosed or treated. Dr. Susan Biegel did write me a prescription for a skin cream. That cream ran out a few days later. I called the Dr.'s office to ask them if I could get a refill, they said they would fax the paperwork to the pharmacy. I had to call the Dr.'s Office (yet again) 3 times, before they finally said they were just going to call it in.

This doctor's office does not seem to be organized, and they do not handle things when they say they will. This office has a great staff, but very poor service.<//text>

This was hands down the shadiest drs office I've been to yet. Free health care isnt even worth the fact that it's free. Every single provider I have been to has been such a joke. I walked into my appointment today and they refused me saying my appointment was 3 days from today. So some one down there rescheduled my appointment without consulting me
Their perfect excuse to back it all up was my lab results weren't on. So I went and contacted lab Corp and my results were in 3 days ago. So I get refused and lied to. Wont be going back I'll end up just paying money for to get back on kaiser.<//text>

HORRIBLE.  I drive 40+ miles down the hill to see a DOCTOR--not a nurse, not a P.A. (Physicials ass-istant); A DOCTOR. Well, for whatever reason, I've been 'demoted' to the J.V. Team.  I havent seen Dr. Biegel for oh probably two g.d. years. Yep.  I had a list: #1) PAIN (I got beat up by SWAT--don't ask, long story.) I  70+ y/o w/ no criminal history. "Cannot give y'all any pain meds--they be addictive." What the Hell do I care, I'm going to be dead in 5 years !" Next item #2: Impotence: "Well, viagra  $90 bucks A MONTH for 3 g.d. pills/Cialis the same." ZERO, cross that off as well.  Finally #3, incontinence from the SWAT delivered groin kick--they 'forgot' to put THAT Rx in with our OTHER paperwork. Thanks P.A.  Oh, we ''had'' a doctor;  skinny, dark skinned like he just rode into the office on his g.d.camel! He spent 5 min. in the room. I didn't understand a word.
As we exited, he was face DOWN on the desk !! Get him a CPAP or oXYGEN therapy or whatever, dude!! So let's check the score: NO doctor, NO pain med, NOTHING for impotence, "forgot'' the incontinence.  ZERO for FIVE; unfortunately, I cannot list zero stars so they get one star.</Text>

I have been a patient of this "Dr." for over 3 years now. I have only seen her personally 1 time! This office is pretty, however it is completely a HOT MESS. It seems Dr. Beigel put more attention to her "Pilot Physicals" for which she makes huge cash from and lets her other patients go by the way side. On Oct. 21, 2015 I called them with a health issue and requested an appointment. The girl put me on hold for 25 minutes. then said, ok I need to get information about why you need to come in. I gave her my info and she said she was emailing the info to Dr. Beigel and I should be getting a call back to set up an appointment that same day (Oct. 21) also I  made sure to tell her that I had a new contact phone number and gave it to her. I never heard back, today's date is December 30, 2015
UPDATE, I called the office again today. I was told that the person whom I spoke to that day in October is no longer with them and they did have a note as to my previous call however tried to call me and they could not reach me because they only had my old number on file...I explained to them I gave the girl my new number and made sure I told her 3 times it was a new number and to update the files to reflect the new number. They claim it was never updated. I also asked why did they at least send me a letter letting me know they were trying to reach me?
The only reason I never called them back until now is to see how long it would take for me to never hear anything back from them. Now I have an even more pressing illness that was recently diagnosed in the ER. They made an appointment for me for today, I will go and hopefully will get the care I deserve. Number 1- for my horrible pain that still is to be properly diagnosed and now Number 2 -proper care for my COPD which was diagnosed in the ER because I did not have faith in Dr. Beigel's office to see me and I was having HUGE breathing problems.< /review>

<review>AWSOME! I have seen MANY doctors in my life and have never experienced such a compassionate person. Dr. Biegel has alot of experience and knowledge. I do not have insurance and she has helped me with my out of pocket expenses. She and her staff have always been very friendly. I never have a problem seeing her instead of her NP.I have recommended many friends to her and they also have a great experience with Dr. biegel and her staff. Way to go GUYS!!!

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I've had several issues with this Dr and facility .  Ive visited this office several times and only once have I met the dr and that's only bc I complained that I had never met her.  On one of my visits, the nurse was taking my vitals, asking questions and started charting on the computer,  no prob.  She then said she would be right back so she could get a jacket bc she was cold. 1 hour later, she never came back. I could hear her and some of the other nurses gossiping and laughing down the hall. I was furious!!! Wth!!  I've been waiting this whole time not even knowing if they remembered I'm in the room. I finally saw another nurse walk by and said I've been waiting and my nurse never came back. She just gave me a look like why was I talking to her. Ughhhh!!!! 20 mins later a "Dr" comes in.  Not dr beigel.  Asked a few questions, redid my vitals and said they have to get referrals and someone would get back to me. That's it. Not once have I received a call from this office.  The receptionist / nurse  with the accent who answers the phones is very rude and when asking her questions she seemed like she was bothered.
I have more to say but I'm getting upset reliving my experience with this Dr and her staff.  I'm looking for another Dr and you should too!<//Review>< pics>

<review>I rated this as Fair because while I had no trouble getting an appointment quickly, first to establish myself as a patient and then to get a physical, got both appointments within a week I did have concerns. Several things bothered me. First, I felt as though I was treated a bit differently (not good) due to the type of insurance I have (Medi-Cal). Secondly, while waiting in the exam room I could over hear the staff outside on multiple occasions being very terse with one another and one reprimanded another at least twice. I don't know what the offense was, but doing so in the hearing of patients is completely unprofessional in my opinion and it made me uncomfortable. They even pulled the nurse who was dealing with me toward the end of my appointment so that the person doing the reprimanding could "talk" to that nurse. Third, they did a test to get my baseline, then the tech came back in and said the NP said it was abnormal and was referring me to a specialist, but that's all the information the tech could give me, no specifics. WHAT? Now I have to wait weeks for the referral and wondering all the time what the NP saw that concerned her and why she didn't come talk to me about it rather than sending in the tech . . . I was not impressed and if I didn't absolutely have to have my physical completed ASAP I probably wouldn't go back . . .< /review>< Pics>

I agree with her philosophy of trying to change the stereotypical medical approach to patient's health.  She believes using education and lifestyle changes to improve health long-term, and medications only if neccessary.  Dr. Biegel's facility is able to do extensive testing to grade your health from physical exams,bone density testing and everything in between.

Dr. Biegel's office philosophy looks to return and maintain people's health without the dependency of medications.  I agree with this, and look forward to refer my patients, family and friends to her office.

<Review>Dr Biegle believes in using her nurse practioners and her medical assistants to do all her work. She is never there. I have never seen her. It's like she is a ghost. I believe, as many do, that doctor Biegle is a terrible doctor and needs to be removed before someone gets hurt.<//Review></record>

< Review>
The staff is rude the majority of the time on the phone.  I have been going to this office for years now and have only seen Dr Biegel one time and that was to come in, shake my hand, sign paperwork and walk out.  The wait time is ridiculous as well.  After the horrible service received today on the phone I will be changing doctors.< /Review>

<text>This office is a joke. They gave me an appointment for 1:15pm and when I show up to my appointment they are at lunch until 2pm and the girl asks if she can reschedule my appointment for 2 hour later... this office has no consideration for their patients. Office personnel is rude!<//text>< pictures>

The staff is always happy, very helpful and knowledgeable of the products they carry. If it's you're first time getting into this these guys are wonderful to talk to who can provide some insight. They also seem to be the only ones near by that carry Dr.Norms regularly which is a plus for me ☺️< /Text>< resp>

Really nice dispensary. The kind of dispensary that i wouldn't mind bringing my mom along.
Now in regards to reason for being of this store, it is top notch. Large flower selection, nicely displayed.
A lot of cannabis related products, edibles, pre-rolls, cannabis infused drinks, etc.
The staff will guide you through their extensive catalog of products.

I will continue my patronage to this dispensary  from now onwards.</Text>

Great joint of a place! Lots of variations esp in their cartridges and vapes sections. So many choices in their live resin and live rosin (wax and caviar) which is just what I was looking for in a dispensary. Customer service was wonderful, and Julian was extremely helpful. Will def come back to get his compendium of knowledge. Also love that first time visitors get 15% off!< /Review>

< review>
Brittany was awesome- my first dispensary experience as it’s not legal where I’m from, and she pretty much laid out how all the different mediums of consumption worked really well. Not sure how the pricing is as I don’t have anywhere to compare it to, but I was able to get a few goodies! I would recommend supplying a free pack of matches with a purchase of a preroll, but that’s just me. Thanks guys!<//review>

Sweet Flower arts district is one of the best dispensaries I’ve been to-and I’ve been to many! The products, the aesthetic and most importantly, the costumer service. Jordan assisted me in my first visit and I always ask for him to this day! To find a budtender with so much knowledge and heart in what he does makes the experience that much more unique than other places I’ve been to. I’ve shopped for my grandma and stepdad and his recommendations have made a huge difference. Thanks so much Jordan’s and Sweet Flower!</text>

My experience with the shop has always exceeded my expectations. Jordan G. has always helped out getting the best products I need as I have recurring back problems. His recommendations have literally helped me through my pain and to live a better life. Thank you Sweet flower and Jordan with great customer service.< /text>

The people here are outstanding. I buy tinctures for sleep and pain compounds. The only issues have nothing to do with the company- the beyond outrageous taxes, and the inconsistency of inventory. For people who wholeheartedly embrace this healthful industry, please write to your state and local politicians about the taxes. And remember, cigarettes kill more than 700k people per year and no one does from cannabis.</review>

Sweet Flower has got to go. They only have overpriced product and don't validate those prices with any quick/quality customer service. When you finally get someone to come to you they try to sell you on stuff you don't want creating an uncomfortable experience that last twice as long. They are trying to capitalize on the booshie look to mask that they're just a bad weed shop. Sorry you guys need to go.<//text>

First time at this store and my budtender Amber couldn’tve been more helpful. Got a healthy assortment of concentrates and vapes to keep me busy during these crazy times 😜. Highly recommend this store!! 👌</Review>

Just went to the Costa Mesa Facility yesterday and had such an incredibly positive experience. I felt motivated constantly and without the drill sergeant feel of most boot camp style workouts. The music was pumping and I left feeling so energized. I loved that the community was so welcoming. Other members welcomed me in and showed me were things were and the trainer, Erin was awesome. Thanks so much Total Training. I'll definitely be back.< /text>

<Text>The best gym I have ever attended. Every time I come here I feel like home. No more are the days where I hop into a gym and feel intimidated with all the different machines and workouts and different people using those machines. At Total Training everybody is on the same page and are doing the same work out. Every week there is a different workout and the instructors motivation to keep going. I love to come to this place because of how encouraging it is for weight loss and to gain a community of support. Thank you Total Training for providing this service so that people from all areas in orange county can come to you feeling confident about their health and fitness.< /Text>< Pics>

I absolutely love Total Training. I’ve been with Tammy any Gregg since the good old boot camp day at the park. Every single workout is fun and affective to me. I am a mom of 2 little ones so I have to get up at 5:30am everyday to go to 6am class. But the fact that I get up everyday to get my sweat on days something about TTF. They care about you and they want you to succeed and meet your goals. After my early work out I always feel amazing to carry on my days.</review>

Seriously so much fun! I love that they provide events outside of exercise for their members. It really makes it friendly and family like and makes it easier to be accountable for yourself and others so that you actually get results! The workouts get switched up and they even offer strength training classes if you dislike the treadmill.<//review>

Really clean facility with clean showers and restrooms! The trainers are fantastic with lots of energy! The boot camp is definitely challenging, and at first, could seem intimidating. But the way the trainers show you the moves and take time to give you one on on attention if you need it, makes the class approachable and doable.<//text>

I'm so happy to have found total training! I love the hiit format and have gotten so much better at running because of it. I also like how they use the heart rate monitors so you can make sure you're pushing yourself and also feel results by seeing calories burned. They also have a bunch of different class formats which keeps it interesting!<//Text>

The best workout experience I have ever had. The trainers push you to your fullest potential, but in a non-aggressive way which I truly respect and appreciate. Everyone there has good vibes. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a fun, high energy atmosphere.</Text>

This is the craziest, hardest, most fun workout I’ve ever done and I’ve been to a lot of different gyms and boot camps in my day. I love all the trainers, especially Abbey, she doesn’t talk to loud into the mike or play the music too loud 😊.  (Some do) I actually look forward to my workouts here. I can’t wait til the Costa Mesa Mesa location adds more classes in the early afternoon.  Come join the fun!</Text>

This class is fun and hip, I play D1 collegiate soccer and I thought I was in shape until I took a class haha. It kicks your a**! The great thing about it is that you go at your own pace completely. They don’t specify what speed you should be at they just call out a certain pace category and you give whatever your range is within that category. There is no shame in taking breaks, I do them too!!</Text>

It was my first time doing this type of workout Ropes and Reps and I really liked it. The fact that we jump from one short exercise to another then on the treadmill, it wasn t boring, I always had the trainer right there to show me the right way to do it. Really nice! I think i’ll try this twice a week and when I get stronger, I’ll get the unlimited pass.< /Text>

Hands down best gym around! Classes are always challenging but a lot of fun. Instructors are top notch/best in County! I've been to Barry's, Equinox, LA Fitness, 24 Hour, Crossfit, Yoga Works, Renaissance... Total Training is the best! The one gym I've enjoyed being a member of and prioritized attending classes for above reasons and the community. The people in the classes are fantastic too! I started here about a year after Baby #2 was born... I was struggling with baby weight and juggling #workingmom. It took a little while for me to find my groove but I found it thanks to Tammy and her inspiring team!< /Text>

I’ve finally found a gym that has the right balance for me. The workouts incorporate cardio and weights. My muscles are constantly sore because they  change up the workouts everyday.  The trainers are awesome and the whole staff is welcoming and friendly. Can’t see myself going anywhere else! Love TT!!!<//review>

I hit a wall in my weight loss and Jackie convinced me to give this gym a shot. I was a little hesitant at first but I was able to continue my weight loss. Every class is different and challenging, so you'll never get bored. I want to say this gym is amazing, but at the same time I don't want my smaller sized classes to get crowded. The place is very clean, class times fit in with my busy schedule and the best part of this gym are the people that work there. They are all very friendly and motivating, even during the 530a classes!</text>

<Text>Everybody is very supportive and encouraging, including the members in class with you. They’re not easy workouts, but nothing that changes your body will be anything other than challenging. It’s a comfortable place to do your best...and push yourself that much more. Sam and Kate are such great instructors; they help keep you mostivated and help you adjust form, push your weights when you need it, and play a great mix of rock, ‘80s, Latin, etc. in their playlists. Just really a great bunch of people to be around! I totally recommend this gym.</Text>< pics>

Words cannot express how lucky and thankful I am to have found this place!!! In love with the instructors and all the grit they bring to each class. TT never disappoints! I love the balance between cardio and weight training. Laguna Hills location, you rock!! Thank you for all that you for us. Changing 1 life at a time!<//Review>

My husband I have been going to Total Training Fitness for a year now. We love it! I've tried for years to get him to workout with me and aside from the one yoga class I dragged him to, this is the only place he has ever wanted to workout at and we have become regulars. I started training with Tammy 8 years ago when she held bootcamps at the park and I've always loved her energy and style of teaching. Now at the gym we have a variety of teachers and a different format every day. My favorites are Burnout, Endurance and Strength! I've always been active but I have weak arms. Since going to TT my push-ups have improved and I went from 5 lb weights to 15-20 lbs weights now!  I love the heart rate monitors and it gets me to push a little harder. This has really helped my endurance in our small 5-10K races we like to do a couple times a year. We really love the community that TT creates. We've made friends and enjoy all the activities the TT team plans for the group. It's definitely made us a more active couple that enjoys being outdoors more!</Text>

<review>I joined Total Training about a year and a half ago, thinking it would be a short term thing, and I got hooked. I love the variation in classes, instructors, and format. The classes are fun and go by quickly, I feel like I get a great workout, and I look forward to going. Definitely has made working out so much better! And the gym also holds lots of social group activities like hikes around OC, parties and gatherings, beach yoga, even groups training for half marathons together, which is a unique benefit compared to any other gym I’ve ever attended... I also feel like the HIIT workouts have boosted my metabolism, and I’m loving that it’s easier to maintain my weight these days! If you’re considering HIIT, I’d highly reccomend Total Training.< /review><Time>1549565682249<//Time>< Name>

<Review>Love these HIIT workouts. Great environment with all the lights & music. They have an awesome group of trainers at Total training (LH) , they are very personable & encouraging. They try their best to make sure your form is right and to motivate you when you’re feeling gassed out. I personally haven’t done any HIIT classes before so it’s very new and exciting to have different works every couple of minutes - bouncing off and on the treadmill is a big plus since I hate cardio lol. Love this place & would highly recommend checking them out!< /Review>< Pics>

We don’t have enough nice things to say about the service we received from R&S,  Sid is a very pleasant man to talk with, very knowledgeable of our electric gate problem ( rodent damage) and was confident he could get our gate repaired and synced to our automobiles with out replacing the whole unit (which saved us a lot of money). The Technicians that performed the repair (Jack & Fabian) were very customer service oriented, very professional and knowledgeable of there task and very quick at fixing our gate opener. ( they even had to deal with a rodent that didn’t want to leave 😳 ). Thank you once again for your quick quality service.</text>

<Text>R&S Erection Tri-County, Inc. responded quickly and very professionally to our need.  Our rapid roll up door had stopped functioning and in a food manufacturing environment it is critical to be in operation.  Both Michael and Herbert followed food safety guidelines and provided an excellent field report.  Thank you for you help!

The Albany Ultra Fast door curtain had come to the end of its useful life so the decision was made to replace the curtain.  A modern version was ordered and installed by Nathan & Herbert in perfect time before our seasonal pack.  They were able to modernize and adapt the safeties for superior personnel  protection.  Thank you R&S for always meeting our needs.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1618875530756, 'text': 'Thanks Ivo, We are #1 in speed doors in CA.

Had a door issue of our front door not locking properly. We called on 5/5/21 and they had two technicians at our place same day! Michael and Khalid did a great job and fixed our door with great ease. Super happy with the service.< /review>

Project: Installation of custom electric swing gates, from design to final inspection. I cannot praise R&S enough for their professionalism, quality workmanship, willingness and ability to work with the Client, and delivery of a flawless product. Wholeheartedly recommend for any project within their expertise.</Review>

Justin & Khalid, inspected the door and quickly noticed a bad spring. They explained in detail what needed to be done. What really impressed me was the professionalism they displayed. They were super polite, and took the time to mask-up, which indicates hey really care, about your health & safety. They will return to finish up the work, as new springs had to be ordered. I use them for all the door & gate maintenance on the property. I'd recommend R&S to anyone who needs storage repair work done. Don't settle for less, when you can use the best!<//Review>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I am a property manager in Modesto and have been for many years, so I use hundreds of vendors each year for all sorts of projects. In that time i have a come across only a few vendors that are notably responsive, helpful, caring and knowledgable. R&S is one of these vendors. They are always quick to respond and their customer service is spectacular. I can say with confidence they are my favorite gate and garage door company to work with They have saved my communities time and money everyday, but a great company is nothing without having great people. My main contact at R&S, Sierrah, is one of my favorite people to work with across every company i come in contact with she is unusually honest, so helpful and always has a positive attitude even when working on a project that make me want to put pull my hair out. She certainly deserves a raise and i can definitely see her moving way up within the company into a senior management position.  Although we have worked with R&S for many years and we have had a good relationship, it was not until we got Sierrah as our liason that the the professional relation truly blossomed into a partnership. I could not have managed all of my MANY gates with the same precision and grace if it were not for R&S, but more specifically Sierrah, I cannot say enough about them, but suffice it to say, if you are i,need of gate or garage services, R&S should be #1 on you list. If i could give more than 5 stars i most certainly would. Keep up the great work!< /Review>< pictures>

Called out R&S Monday morning due to a gate issue, didn't have to wait for an appointment. They came the same day. Rocky checked all the equipment and had our gate up and running without any issues.<//Review>

I’ve been using R &S for years now and that Cid is one great guy! Great people person and always explains everything so I can understand the problem as well. Cid always figures out what needs to be done to get things up and working again. Couldn’t be anymore happy with his tech knowledge of the entry gate system. Great company... I’d never use anyone else other than R & S.

<Text>I have worked with these guys for years. Very professional. Very knowledgeable. They will always go out of their way to help you out of a jam. Cid is extremely knowledgeable about the gates and gate controllers and very easy to get in contact with. I would recommend these guys for anything gate or roll up door related. Not to say that they can't do other jobs as well. I've only had experience with them fixing gates and roll up doors.</Text><UserId.>112972401702135648132< /UserId.>< Date>

<text>During my time working for The Cooper Company, I have come across many vendor interactions. As a property management corporation, it is the utmost priority to provide the best customer service possible, in a minimal amount of time. As we work with MANY gate systems across multiple associations, I recommend no one other than R&S to be your first choice service provider. Working specifically with Sierrah for any service requests thrown my way, she is first to guarantee whatever job I need completed is done in a timely, successful manner. With much experience in the industry alone, as well as her own employees, she is always able to appoint the best technician for the service call at hand. I look forward to working with her daily as she has become a huge part in our business in addition to being an incredible vendor, and I hope to use her for the duration of my time with The Cooper Company!< /text>< Pictures>

These guys stopped in front of my house yesterday to call their boss. Their company was doing a job for my neighbor and another of their trucks had already been dispatched to the jobsite, so they were double booked.  They had stopped to call their boss and find out where they were to go next.  Our gate had been giving us some trouble lately, so we talked them into servicing it while they were there.  We had been trying to get Brand X out of Oakdale scheduled for some time, but they would never show up.  Cid and his guy were in and out in about 30 minutes and did a great job.  Chain is lubed up and no longer dragging.  They also serviced the control unit.  We are now set up on a bi-annual agreement to have our gate regularly maintained.  Appreciate the work well done, as well as the professional and courteous way they conducted themselves.  As a small business owner myself, these are the kind of guys a boss would be proud to have on his team!!</text>

Rocky , Sid & Daniel,, All very smart & knowledgeable . not only did they fix the problem they were called out for, they took the time to track down a lingering problem i have had with my auto gate for over 6 months and fixed that as well. If you have a gate on your property R&S is who i recommend you call if you want the job done correctly!!!!!!!!!</text>

<text>Very irresponsible employees. They were working on a electric gate in a gated community in Oakdale. They overided the system so that the gates would stay completely open as they worked on it. As I was exiting the gated community one of the workers was working on a box and he closed the gate on my trailer causing damage to my $13,000 trailer. They accused me of " not making it around the loop" when it was a clear straight shot to drive out of the gated community with plenty of room to make it through. We contacted the company and they were very rude and they refused to pay for the damages they did to my trailer. They said it was my fault for exiting out the entrance gate which was completely false because I exited through the exit gate. They will not pay for their own mistakes this just goes to show how they handle situations when their employees cause property damage.<//text>< rating>

< Review>
A family friend referred me to this dental office so I took my daughter for the first time and she absolutely loved it and so did I. We have honestly had really bad experiences with the past two dental office we had been too so when we walked in to this office it was completely different the girls at front desk are really nice and friendly you can tell they like their job, unlike other places where you walk in and see the girls at front desk with their long face. But yeah I really recommend this dental office the experience was definitely good from start to finish. Thank you everyone at Childrens Dental Fun Zone for your patience and nicely job towards our children and parents.< /Review>

Super friendly, and helpful staff from the receptionist's to the doctor and everyone in between. Very kid friendly, my son was a little nervous to go but felt comfortable, safe and completely at ease once inside talking with everyone. The place is very clean. We had a wonderful experience.😁< /review>

Their patience and understanding is amazing! My son being nervous threw a fit and cried on both visits, but Alma and Wendy were great with him. On my first visit they were able to accommodate me without an appointment and the second time (with appointment) we waited less then 5 minutes to be called in. Overall I am very pleased with their professionalism and kindness towards the children even the “difficult” ones, like mine.</text></record>

My 5 year old girl actually enjoys coming to this dentistry and I understand why. They’re always so kind and welcoming, clean, and efficient and I’m always in and out faster than I expect. It’s fun for the kids, there’s good entertainment throughout to keep the kids a little distracted and they leave happy with a small gift. Most importantly they’ve done an amazing job with making my daughter feel comfortable with all the dental work she’s had and have made me feel comfortable with the whole process.I Highly recommend!<//review>

<review>Amazing experience from start to finish. The girl in the front took our temperature, called us inside when there was an open seat, she was super friendly and great with my daughter. The person who took us back gave my daughter a stuffed animal and a high five and put her right at ease. The dr was so friendly and even gave us tips and tricks on how to brush her teeth better. I’m glad we found this place.</review>< pictures>

Great and friendly staff. Daughters first time and I definitely had anxiety coming in. But they did offer reassurance. Also when my daughter was completely done and over getting work done, they said they would continue another day and did not force anything. Which I loved.</Text>

The staff was very friendly, this was my kids very first dental visit and he was nervous but they made him feel at ease. They explained exactly what they were going to do and let him take a look at what they would use so he was comfortable. Great Job!!</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I love this place. My daughter is a new patient that is 6 years old and It was so important that her visits to the dentist is a good one. This experience wasn't just Amazing to her it was for me. It's so important that she feels safe and calm and this place gave us more. Everyone was so sweet and helpful, of I had any questions,  and trust I always have questions and they was so clear and wasnt short with me I'm so grateful for their services Dr. WU AND HER TWO AMAZING ASSISTANTS AND THE OTHER ASSISTANT AND DOCTORS THANK YOU. Also, it looks so cute inside and my daughter really like the movies she was able to watch well getting her teeth clean.

<Text>I never got to actually go in so I can't attest to their services or staff. They sound pretty great. HOWEVER their HIPPA/Photography Consent (ALL one DOCUMENT)  One Part says they wont share your Name and if they do to 3rd parties they will ensure that Party Follows HIPPA and its for something you need. HOWEVER, the photograph section says they can  and I quote" I, hereby grant permission to Children’s Dental FunZone, its employees or representatives, to take and use; photographs, digital images, videotape, audio recordings or quoted marks, educational or other power point or presentation materials of me or prepared by me, or of my property, for use in promotional or educational materials"  So they can audio record/video record/take pics as they do not specify pictures of what or videos of what so of  you or your child without you knowing because they already got consent AND they can use that for promotional  materials and if that wasn't scary AF as a parent here is another quote " I further agree that my name and identity may be revealed in descriptive text or commentary in connection with the image (s).I agree that the media may contact me to speak with me regarding my involvement in Children’s Dental FunZone activities." So much for HIPPA and patient confidentially. I know to some people this isn't a big deal but to me this is an invasion of privacy and a HUGE RED FLAG. It be Nice if they said of your mouth/teeth/oral cavity regarding the pictures/audio/video but it doesn't. Go to a Dentist that  asks for specifics related to the treatment being received on a need basis, not an open ended waiver of rights.

<text>I brought my 7yo here because our regular dentist was not accepting patients other than emergencies during the Covid 19 pandemic and I knew my daughter had cavities that needed to be fixed. So, made the appointment with them and was seen right away. They scanned our temperatures at the door and were very clean.

They really do keep a positive up beat attitude. They answered all my questions throughout the process because I was nervous for my child going through her first baby root canal.

Dr. Kohan is a serious dentist but can easily use soft tones of voice and kindness so much that my daughter liked her and the office staff very much. Dr. Kohan explains every tool and reason for them during the process and this made my daughter really like her. Christian was a big help as well in assisting my daughter with extra positivity and encouragement.

We will be returning for her follow-up for sure. I’m only  disappointed that they don’t service adults. Lol. We could all use positivity and kindness when experiencing dental work! =)

Thank you Dr. Kohan and Staff!

From,

< Review>
There service is absolutely amazing. When I walked in the receptionist Maria greeted me with a delightful smile. My daughters aren’t big fans of the dentist, however the dental assistant Noemi made things easier for them and made them feel more comfortable. Another thing I really liked was that they explained why they were using certain equipment, which I thought was great because many people don’t know what or why certain thing are being used. Overall my experience was great and I would continue to bring my kids here.</Review>

<review>This place was great! My daughter has severe level 3 Autism and is extremely difficult when it comes to brushing her teeth, after repeated fails with her pediatrician trying to get a look in her mouth, we were told to go see a dentist who could offer sedation for special needs children in these type of situations. It is so cute in there and set up and decorated especially for children. My kid hates hospitals, clinics, pretty much any open white room with only scary looking medical equipment in it, she didn't even suspect a thing and was into the blocks, cartoon movie playing, and fascinated mostly with the beautiful finding Nemo themed aquarium they have built into the wall! Once we were called in, it was so different than expected , the cleanest dental place I've ever been to, not even kidding I've seen gross places that make you question sanitation .... Not this place there's more colors and toys displayed just like when you win a prize, a very smart idea,  the toys are encouraging and motivating and helps with distraction , to get the work done. My daughter was a bit fussy, but that's cuz she can't sit still being around interesting new things. Also the room is set up for multiple kids with their own cute Lil dentist chairs. We were a few seats away from another little girl getting her teeth cleaned with her family there as well. Which I think made my daughter more at ease. And she didn't feel to overwhelmed like she usually does if people in a room only focus on her. And now for the ending which was the best, my daughter actually liked the dentist lady, I'm not being dramatic when I say my kid is usually dramatic lol, but she sure made me look like a lier lol. She did pretty well, struggled a lil here and there, but she must of really liked the dentist because she gave in for once and let the dentist even brush  her upper back teeth, sorry if I sound exaggerative, but that there was amazing for me to see, it's just an autism mom thing not to many can understand :) They really know how to work with kids and make them comfortable, definitely recommended. Also great dental advice given to parents 👍<//review><userid>109180649854084485421</userid><Date>1583550346341< /Date>< Name>

I was afraid of how my 3 year old's would do at  the dentist. That changed the moment I got in the office super kid friendly put my kids at ease, the front desk staff was super kind and knowledgeable. Then Dr. Shay was beyond amazing with my kids, she made them feel super comfortable. Her assistant was very helpful as wel. Overall a great dentist!!! I know I found my kids dentist!!<//Text>

Very dissapointed not coming back here again i rather drive to the reseda location. The DA really needed to work on her skill with children and make sure the child feels comfortable. They also have to make sure that they wear there PPES at all times.</Review>

I've never been treated better. This is clearly a step up from all those generic shops. The environment is chill, it feels more like a man cave / upscale lounge. The stylist are amazing, friendly, and cool to talk to. Ask for Alex, she does an amazing job and gets results exactly as you wanted. I just brought in a picture and the result was identical.

< review>
This place is very nice and I was able to get a haircut the same day I called. The girls were very nice as was my stylist. She made good conversation and the massage before and after was definitely a perk. My only complaint is that my fade didn't blend very well and the product that she was trying to sell me was $20 which was just some pomade. And $30 for a haircut was a little pricey also bit I just wanted to try them out. Overall it wasn't bad.</review>

Very warm place with friendly and fun staff.  We brought my nephews (4 and 2) here when they were doing a fundraiser and we were extremely happy with the results of their cuts, better than any other place we've gone before.< /review>

First time trying the Head Game, it is a very fancy place to get a hair cut. The service is amazing. The hair stylists are like artists. It’s hard to go back to a regular hair place after going to the Head Game< /review>

On the pricey side at $30, but a quality haircut in a nice atmosphere. It would be better if they offered all of their guests a beer (as opposed to only haircut club members) to really round out the concept, but they don't. The haircut club is also just a bit outside the realm of reason since the haircut don't roll over month to month.<//review>

First place I've ever been to where they actually listen to my requests. Everyone's hair is different and does different things, so I was sick of hair stylists thinking they knew what was best. I recognize that they ultimately know, but Noone knows your own hair better than you, and these people recognize that<//Text>

< Review>
It was ok, i stopped going after a few months as the scheduling seemed to be an issue. I wouldn't recommend their monthly program though. After i signed up the girl at the front would never ask when i wanted to come in for my next appointment and so i would leave with nothing scheduled. I tried to schedule all appointments a few month outs so i wouldn't forget. I started getting calls that they needed to reschedule. So i stopped going. I feel if management would make it a procedure to always ask clients if they would like to schedule their next appointment i would have found more value in the service. Seems easy. Stylest 5-star but the business overall.... MEH, just didnt see the value<//Review>

It was foggy in SF so we drove down  Hwy1 through Pacifica to Rockaway Beach. It was clear and the waves were crashing onto the shore. It was Tuesday afternoon so the parking lot in back of the hotel was almost deserted. We really enjoyed spending time in the sun. It's only 45 minutes from our house with weekday traffic. This is not a surfing beach. But, there are trails if you want to hike.< /text>

Great experience!! the raw power of the ocean is the best. I could spend all day here listening to the waves crash. This place will hold a special place in my heart. If you have a chance stop here and spend a few moments.</Review>

Absolutely stunning place to visit! We didn’t wear proper hiking gear, but many folks did as one side of the beach’s mountains are quite hilly. Even so, as long as you are careful, it’s okay. The other side of the beach is paved, safe, and very easy to hike. But the more difficult side is 100x more beautiful.<//review>

I start my Highway 1 drive in Pacifica...
Stop at the Pacifica Java coffee shop then  drive down the Coast.

I live in the south bay and take 280 to the 35 Pacifica turn off then down Sharp Drive to Highway 1 which is only 2.5 miles from Rockaway Beach area.</review>

Beautiful place to go for a walk! The air smells so fresh and clean here. Restrooms available. Watch the surfers or have a picnic looking at the view. I saw some mountain bikers . Restaurants and shops available too.  Be careful of the poison oak!
Loved the Successories store with handmade jewelry- such a fun stop.</Text>

<review>First of all this is my secret spot since a lot of people don't know about it.  No matter the weather,  time permitting, I would get a sandwich or burrito drive there park and enjoy my meal with the ocean in front of me. If the weather is nice, I can get out and just be a few steps from the beach. I also enjoy seeing the few fishermen fishing from the shore. Don't bother me cuz I have often opened my car window to hear the waves and take a little nap.</review>< pics>

Starting at the north end of Pacifica there's Mussel Rock State Beach and trail which borders Daly City, there's the Esplanada Beach on Esplanada Ave. Than the Manor beach which has a steep trail down to the beach. Past Manor Dr right next to the SF RV Park there's a small parking lot with beach access.  Than Pacifca Pier which is next to Sharp Park Beach and a golf course. There's beach access and a great walking and if you want you can hike it up to Mori Point and enjoy a fascinating views. after that beach and over the mountains you'll have the Rockaway Beach which also has a trail up another hill headed south, than that trail you can go up and over to the other side or drive highway 1 and reach Linda Mar Beach is the official Pacifca State Beach, where most the surfers like to go, than tiny Pedro Point, Privately owned beach called Shelter Cove the lastly a trail through Shelter Cove will bring you to Gray Whale Cove State Beach.</text>

Short little walk along the beach. Right up along side a motel? There seems to be trails over the Clif which look interesting. Free parking. Come sit and watch the surfers. Pretty cold and windy though.<//Text>

Tiny parking lot, but it has a great ocean view! There is usually a spot despite the small size, except at sunset when everyone and their mother arrives to take pictures. the beach is teeny and usually has fishermen taking the space available, although sometimes families come out to play. It is a short walk to the other side where surfers like to go. Moreover you are close to two awesome hiking trails going up to the tops of hills with even more amazing views. Finally, you can also walk around the tiny shopping area where this is a cute cash-only coffee shop and some other local treasures. Its a nice place to spend an hour or two away from the madness that occurs everywhere else.< /text>

Good place to have dinner or lunch and breakfast. A must to see and spend a night.A beautiful place to just sit in your car and relax. You can walk by the beach. Walk by the water and run for the waves. Can dine or spend a nite or two. A must to see</Review>

I love this beach because I can pull my car up to a forward spot and my mom, 91, can watch the goings on from the car. We quite often see whale spouts, patience required. I don't reccomend this beach for swimming as the water treatment plant runs into the water there.< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Great hike. Wear layers and it can get windy. The views of the ocean are beautiful, we saw LOTS of birds, maybe it was good fishing? The hike up has some rough patches so maybe not great for toddlers unless you can pack them, but it's not too strenuous. Hard to believe you're 10 mins from the city.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808f7a8b9285439f:0xec096c1a3b3e1ab2<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The beach is rather small, but it connects to various walking trails with amazing views of the Pacific Ocean. There's free parking, a restroom and places to eat very close by.  You may want to wear layers because it can get chilly in that area.</review>

I loved all of the Pacific Coast hwy trails and parks so if you saltwater in your bloodline ir just want spectacular views and fresh air it is worth the effort get out there and follow the Coastal Trail. Be on guard if you venture into the surf for rips and under tows but enjoy!!!< /text>

<Text>Love this place! Thank you to Maggie and her Uncle for this place and your service! What a great health and herb tea shop to handle all that ails you. What I like most about this place is the family run location makes you feel at home with games and quiet lounge. Many more years of success for the business! Happy Chinese New Year!<//Text>< response>

Absolutely lovely place. I’ve been going here since high school and the Pong’s are fantastic people, albeit intimidating at first. The tea here is fantastic and the vibe is so comfy I just wanna take a nap.
The other patrons there are super easy to talk to, as well. Love this place. 1 billion stars!< /Review>

During COVID19 times, I called this store to verify hours. The woman who answers replied 10:00.  I then asked if they sold teapots, she said she didn’t know what I was talking about, she said she doesn’t speak English then hung up on me.  Wow - so much for brick and mortar.  I ordered on Amazon.  I definitely won’t even bother going into this store.</Review>

This has got to be the best tea house for miles. Extensive bar of tea and a very large amount of tea for a very affordable price. Very nice attendants and a great place for a late night date most nights. Especially if you like to smoke you can sit in the patio. The blooming teas are pretty neat to watch as well(they are also reusable if you re dry them).<//review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>A cozy little tea house with a quaint, homey vibe to it. Like many shops in the area, it attracts a young, hip, college crowd. There is a large selection of hand mixed, loose-leaf teas. Each tea that I've tried (about 6) is wonderful, and really hits the spot on cold nights. The only real complaint that I have is that some of the staff, particularly the older gentleman, is impatient and a bit rude. If you can look past that, it's a great destination for a quiet night out by yourself, or with a small group of friends.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtHv4at9UouSNMWcZGCSe_X74XzoTxz8qT323i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5ZwCV_e6ap68DhFR5MFydaY4Md5qrO-8LOEhP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

Great place to hang out and socialize with friends! The tea's are okay but it's not really why I go there. If you have friends who are already regulars, it'll make it a way better experience! If not, and you're a really social person, I still suggest this place... In any case, if you're looking for a new chill place to hang out, this place is definitely a contender!<//text>

<Review>Great drinks. Tucked away, so someone usually has to bring you the first time around. The owner is awful, but the wife is really sweet. I love coming here when she’s at the counter. Impressive selection of fresh teas and a cool, artsy atmosphere. Cool spot in an uncool Claremont<//Review>< Pics>

The board and card games they have care really fun too. Great place to study or catch up with someone.

I'd only wish they'd have 1 or two savory meal  options to pair these tea's with. And if they had a separate dedicated smoking area. You have no option but to walk past all the people smoking to get inside. I am not a smoker and this is annoying at times.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I never write reviews but they deserve one

It was my first time going in there so I didn’t know you had to buy something to be inside until I saw a review online after.

My friend and I sat down at a table to get situated and then we were going to buy some tea. Well my friend and I were immediately confronted by an older Asian woman with a thick accent yelling at us and waving at us to leave.

The workers were unnecessarily rude and disrespectful. It also didn’t help that there were no signs that said we had to buy something so we were confused as to why we were kicked out.

They have the worst customer service (not exaggerating), do not recommend.<//review>

The tea at this place isreally good. I would recommend going here for the tea however the service is less than stellar. If you are looking for a coffee house type atmosphere with tea instead this place will fit the bill if you get the right person serving you at the front desk.</review>

I was sitting with my friend who had fotten a drink. The lady, who may be the owner, came over in a hurry, waived her hand frantically to get up. Said something about me blocking the tea display. All I did was sit in a seat that was already there. She went back behind the counter and talked on her cellphone loudly in Cantonese, which is fine, except the place had a quiet atmosphere, so it was disruptive instead. Not recommended<//Text>

<text>I've been here a few times now and I really like it. I love the selection of teas that you could open and smell and choose yourself. I like that you can get it hot, cold, or with boba. Their food is just instant snacks and I definitely wouldn't eat here, but I love the tea and it's open late, which is not common in Claremont. Minus one star for all the smoking on the patio though. You can tell it's a popular place for some groups and it really feels like they just take over the patio and smoke. Not a fan of that.

Edit: I've witness staff yell at people who haven't ordered. She shouts at them to get out and it makes everyone inside uncomfortable so I'm taking away another star.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

This place has the best teas you can find. It's a great tea house to find unique people, including elves with pointy ears. They have indoor and outdoor tables. They have mugs for staying in and cups to go. They have boba too. You pick your tea and give them the jar and then put it back again. Color coded for your pleasure. Did I mention an entire bookshelf of board games?</text>

Really cool place and teas, but the owner has his dad running the cafe and he is very rude. Half of the reason I go out is for the environment and this is a very unfriendly environment. Uncomfortable setting, I won't be coming back here.</text>

They have the most delicious teas. Try the double dragon Jasmin flowering tea. With honey of course. Hot. And watch it unfold into a beautiful array of flowers.</text>

You have to order a drink to say in the facility and the one lady in charge told me to purchase something or leave 5 minutes in, which was rude. Then I buy a chai tea for $4.25 and she shorts me $1.75 of change.</Text>

<review>I wished I could put no stars, one of the worst cafes I've been to. They have a large selection of teas but the customer service here is horrible! The guy working on 7/24/18 at night was so rude. This was my husband and I first time coming here and I asked what do you recommend, he pretty much told me to grab a tea and bring it to the counter without recommending anything. Then a girl ordered a Taro drink and accidentally picked up someone else's order and told her in front of everyone that's not your drink,Taro is purple and that's not your drink. Don't expect everyone to know what Taro looks like! I will never come here again and hope people read these reviews before supporting a business like this.👎🏽</review></record>

I had one with stevia in it that I haven't been able to find again.

Pro Tip: Try one of the ball teas next to the cashier for a special treat - they all taste more or less the same to me, but they blossom into beautiful flowers in your mug.

Public Service Announcement: Be prepared to tell the cashier whether you want your tea Cold or hot, for here or to go, and Honey or no honey - and ask for "a little honey" unless you like a LOT.<//text>< response>

A beautiful place for the low-life's... not really. Cool atmosphere, definitely smoking-friendly, bad management and rude customer service, and bad coffee-- but good boboa, kind of.

Don't come here for anything edible-- but make sure you BUY SOMETHING (or you will be rudely and forcibly removed-- a little exaggeration.)

This is a great place to sit around, hop on the computer, chit-chat, meet college girls (during college seasons), and a perfect place for any creative-type!<//review>

I don't know what these other people are talking about with the comments about being rudeness and bad customer service. I always find the older man and the other people who work there to be very friendly. Of course you have to buy something to sit there and use their WiFi, that only makes sense. It's not even expensive at all. Go to Starbucks if you don't plan on buying anything.< /Review>< UserId.>

Lots of teas. Don't be put off by the rude owners, though, they will help you pick out exactly what you are looking for.<//Review>

Visited dd's Discounts in San Fernando Valley last weekend. The store was well kept, clean and stocked. Found lots of great deals too !! It was nice that the items in store were not picked over and all the employees that I encountered were very nice and helpful. The highlight of my visit though, was the cashier my daughter and I encountered he really made my day. He has the most outgoing personality, and it brightened my day. He was friendly, energetic, very respectful, and has a smile that is both rare and welcoming in customer service. I had to let his manager know on the spot. I had an awesome shopping experience in this store, and will definitely be back!!!</Text>

<text>Good discount store. You can get a cute T or tank to wear around the house for $2-$4 or a cute top for under 10 bucks Not always the  best made. Still good store. However, I don't think I have ever received anything close to decent Customer Service. I literally go in at least once a week and I have NEVER been checked out by a pleasant employee. Never! Every single one of them are rude. They don't say hi  how are you, your welcome, have a nice day... nothing. Ask anybody. I dont go there for great customer service so it doesn't matter so much. If I were corporate I'd send a secret shopper in there once in a while and fire anyone on the spot that did not provide exceptional customer relations at least. The shift manager would be the first to be reprimanded. So that's why I gave a low rating. And the store could be a little cleaner.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Sunday at 6pm, plenty of parking. Great place to find inexpensive clothing and housewares. Also, they have security guard inside, which is great. Came in bought some clothing apparel. Good time to shop here as well, I was able to grab what I need and leave quickly.</Review>

My wife loves the variety of styles of tops especially since Styles 4 Less and Wet Seal closed down out here. The staff is generally nice. Probably recommend to go in the daytime. The parking lot smells of bathroom usage and with the not so great lighting in some sections, I'd recommend go in the daytime.</Text>< pictures>

These stores lack quality in almost everything that they do, so much so you often wonder what ship it sailed in from, maybe some unheard part of the universe? However they are quite affordable and if it's an only choice it's better than most but if you are looking for some good quality long term clothing I suggest you look elsewhere. They have a few good finds like shoes and toys but actual clothes isn't up to par with the modern world. Just my opinion. Thanks.<//text>

This store is a joke, very terrible, Unprofessional, lazy managers. Very Messy messy store.
First they are very biased with letting people use their restroom and when I went in the other day the girl with the blonde hair had such a snobby attitude and is very impolite when I asked about store policy (return) PLEASE PLEASE hire a new set of enthusiastic, friendly, cheerful managers!!</Review>

Love this store & always find great deals. Only thing i dislike about this store is how they have a restroom but its not for the "public" anymore. Ummm, if i have to go, i have to go. You want me to piss on the floor? Or say F your merchandise & never come back? Get over yourselves & let people use the restrooms! Check bags, if you think people are stealing. Restrooms are meant for anyone.<//review>

If I could give it less stars I would. The night manager and her team are rude. I asked if my 5 year old could use the restroom and they rudely said no. I definitely understand that they do not have public restrooms. They had let another customer use it before me asking. If you do it for one do it for all. The rudeness is not needed. What a joke of a manager.<//review>

This DD's has been okay so far, every time I travel to southern CALI I stop by. They seem to have more options to choose from (backpack purses, traveling sets, etc.). It may take a while to find something but when you do it's worth it. They do keep this DD's cleaner than others unless I go when stalk/overnight shift finished putting things back.< /review>

<review>It's like Ross but cheaper.  It's where the stuff isn't high end enough for Ross so they send it to DD's to handle.  The best stuff are the cheap car accessories and home stuff.  They got some clothes too although for guys they seem to be more catering to the ripped pant and cheap gangsta logos on cheap shirts (not my look), they seem to stay with the Ross idea of having a loss retention person to greet you and walk around eyeing everyone.  I tend to not like shopping in a police state but to each their own.</review>< Pictures>

They're usually pretty friendly.  No real complaint it a great place to get all type of things for the home to quick clothes items for the family.  I will say they do a good job keeping the store clean.  Which  makes it easier to shop and  look around for items. So, here an update I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS DD'S IN MY LIFE!!! THE GIRL WAS VERY RUDE LAST NIGHT MARCH 3,2019. (EVENING) I ACTUALLY WENT THERE TO LET MY SON GET A FEW THNGS.BUT, MY DAUGHTER AND I DECIDED TO GET A. FEW THINGS FOR ARE HOME. I PICK UP A KNIFE SET SO ONCE GET UP TO PAY THE STUFF SHE GIVES AN LOOK UP AND DOWN AND STATED THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT PRICE.AS she started to TAKE THE TAG OFF AND SHE ACTUALLY HAD A PROBLEM GET IT OFF. I ASK TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER AND SHE REPLIED I AM THE MANGER ON DUTY. SO I REPLIED BACK BY SAYING WELL I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING AND IT SEEM TO BEEN ON THERE (THE TAG) AS SHE WAS FIGHTING TO PULL THE TAG OFF. THAN SHE GOT RUDE AND LOUD LIKE SHE WANTED TO FIGHT ME MY DAUGHTER HAD TO TELL HER TO BRING HER VOICE DOWN. I FELT TO A POINT SHE WAS USE A STEREOTYPE LIKE ALL BLACK PEOPLE STEAL. WELL NOT THIS ONE!<//review>

<Review>Let me tell you guys my true experience in this store location this store has a horrible manager want in the afternoon , and my brother has to use the restroom at the time I am pregnant so I decided to go with him and one employee would not let us in after experience I was 5 months pregnant and my little 5 year old brother had to use the restroom as well but still employee was rude and instead of letting us in  continue  To argue and as all women know us pregnant women need to used the restroom when we need to we have to there is no choice in that but then the manager comes and tells us that there is no public restroom ,but as we all  know kids and pregnant women are in Exception ... then manager also argued instead of helping and just opened the door ... really horrible experience.</Review><rating>1< /rating><Gmap_id>0x80c25b25bd3b514f:0x5a6cd44b6cc088bf<//Gmap_id>< user_name>

<user_name>Virginia Taylor<//user_name><text>I was  in dd's Lancaster Ca  I had items in my cart it was a Sat.I went to dressing room area to ask to use the restroom before I got in the long line. I was told there was NO PUBLIC RESTROOM.  It was obvious I was a customer since she could see I had items in a cart. So I left the store with out buying anything because I was not able to use a restroom.

< Review>
it's ok. your average dd's store. could be a little cleaner. I just went yestarday but left because my daughter and I saw that they carry women's lingerie. This is the kind you find at adult stores. very explicit and it's location, guess where. Right by childrens clothes. The women are pretty much exposed on the cover of these items. please have some sense to place lingerie as that in a more appropriate area. Or better yet, get rid of lingerie that should be sold at adult stores only. where children are not allowed.<//Review>
