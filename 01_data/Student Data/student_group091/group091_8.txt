<review>I've bought at this bakeshop some pasties several times, I've always been treated with respect, and professional staff, most of the bread is the healthiest. The bread and cookies I order have always been good, well cooked, and warm, not cold, like some other bakeshop places I've gone to, and the staff are friendly and courteous. I will continue to buy bread here!<//review><userid>104681027170077676389</userid><pics>None</pics>< Gmap_id>

My buddy and I were looking to get some desserts and we found this place. We had stopped by this place before but they were closed. Today, they were open and it was a pleasant surprise. They had pies, macaroons, cookies, cakes and they also sell food which I was not interested in. The lady that tended us was so helpful, friendly and took the time to answer all of our questions. We decided to get some tiramisu, cheesecake, cannoli and I don’t remember the name of the last piece but it had custard in it. All were so yummy except for their cannoli which I didn’t care for. The experience was really nice and we enjoyed ourselves. We will definitely be coming back for more.

<text>For my husband's birthday, we needed a small dessert for just the two of us. My husband requested chocolate cake or torte. Royal Bakery recommended a 4 inch by 4 inch triple chocolate cake. The cake has 3 layers of mousse and 3 layers of cake.

After enjoying the dessert, my husband asked me to let Oscar know the cake is delicious. We have known Oscar, bakery/cafe owner, for many years.

The cake was moist with fluffy mousse. Edible frosting, not too sweet.

Highly recommend this delightful dessert.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Best bakery I’ve ever been to in my entire life! I love this place, and have been going here consistently since I was a baby!!! It’s a family-business and has been running with love and amazing quality ingredients from the very beginning! The tiramisu is hands down the best tiramisu I’ve ever had in my entire life - and I’ve had A LOT!!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Everything they did was with cleanliness and care for keeping customers safe during this pandemic. They had obviously planned carefully how to operate and took customer safety seriously. And the food was tasty; the owner and staff were personable and cheerful. I definitely plan to eat at the Royal Bakery next time I'm in Ventura.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>I was visiting from out of town and came across this place. I fell in love with it and went every day while I was in town. It is absolutely adorable and the coffee and baked goods are delicious. I highly recommend the fruit tarts. What really had me coming back every day was the wonderful customer service Everyone is so incredibly friendly and welcoming. They even add a cute little touch when wrapping up your baked goods with a purple ribbon. I cannot wait to come back!<//Text><user_id>103547699644835270176</user_id>< user_name>

A slice of a European cafe in California. All the food is excellent and the desserts are some of the best. The prices are low and atmosphere very relaxed. The kitchen closes after lunch ends at 3pm but the bakery is open until close! The white chocolate cheesecake is incredible.< /review>

Quality, small batches of tantalizing pastries like: One-person fruit pies sparkling with sugar; flaky croissants; chocolatey eclairs. Yes, yes, and more yes! Lunch stuff available from 11 to 2:30. Literally my only wish is that tea was served in real dishes rather than the standard disposable cups. But I understand trying to balance workload, overhead, and profit. I love stopping in here for a treat.< /Text>

If you're trying to eat healthy, this place is the best. Great sandwiches and salads. Then, if you decide to reward yourself with something sweet after eating something healthy, you have the option of baked goods and sweets. The Best of Both Worlds.</Review>

I go to this place pretty often. They’re cakes are amazing but mostly I go there to eat lunch. They’re sandwiches and salads are amazing.  The dressing they used is so delicious. Come here for a quick lunch or dessert and even a birthday cake.  They are the best. Also the owner/manager is super nice and has the best customer service.</review>

This is a Bakery and great place to stop for lunch. Their soups, salads, sandwiches and pizzas are always delicious. Management and staff friendly and fast.  I like quiche and salad with tropical iced tea. Seating inside and patio.  Not a lot of parking but worth finding one for a fresh, healthy lunch here.</review>

Two people, one on the phone but couldn't be bothered to acknowledge us between calls and the other was cleaning the case and didn't even respond to our greeting and just walked away.

<review>I eat at Royal Bakery weekly. Everything they make is delicious. The price for the baked goods may seem high but the quality and presentation are first class. The cakes are works of art and make a beautiful centerpiece for any gathering. I bought cake and flowers for my wife's birthday and she was still slicing pieces of chocolate cake long after the flowers wilted. Breakfast is good too!< /review>< Pics>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>One of my favorite places for lunch. I've only really had their Chicken walnut salad, house salad, Chicken walnut sandwich... & the ice tea is good! (Get the Sun dried tomato bread or roll)
I'm not a fan at all of the cakes!!! I've tried many different cupcakes & slices of cake. Too sweet or just dry. That's why they get the 4 stars. Cookies are okay....  But nothing to rave about.</Review></record>

LOVE their house salad with chicken...I get it every single time. Even if I decide to try something else there, I will always ALSO get one of those because they are just too good. I like to get the dressing on the side because it is pretty large and if you want to save some for the next day the dressing of course makes the lettuce soggy and gross when sitting for a long time. There is not a lot of seating there and they are usually pretty busy, so most of the time I will just get my food to go. Keep in mind it says online that they close at I believe 6 or something but that is only for the bakery. If you want lunch they stop serving around 2 or 2:30 I think so I recommend calling just to make sure. They also have great quiches and if you like sweets they have lots and lots of options. The cow cookies are adorable and delicious which we used to get all the time but now that our diets have changed they are no longer an option for us. Would be nice if they had some gluten free items...if they did, I would definitely try them!< /review><userid>113879680209628307681</userid>< pics>

<Review>Cow cookies. 'nuf said.

Having said that...lol....Been getting my cakes and pastries here for years.  They have the best variety. The white cake with raspberry filling is to die for. So is the fruit tart. The meat filled croissants are yum. Lunches are great too. The brie sandwich is amazing, and you can't go wrong with the Quiche of the day--any day.< /Review>< pictures>

It is good to go somewhere that is not Starbucks or other corporate managed coffee places. We should support more   places like Royal Bakery in our neighborhood. Viva la Royal Bakery.<//Text>

<Text>I had the distinct pleasure of having a conversation with the owner of this bakery, during which I learned he has engineered his lunch menu to be rather healthy (aside from exceptionally tasty). I also understand he has a degree in agriculture to back his quest for healthy ingredients. The food at this bakery, in my opinion, is masterful and delicious, I have found myself a rare gem and I intend to return time, and time again.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This is only a review on the baked goods from Royal Bakery & Café, so keep that in mind. Their sandwiches and salads actually looked pretty darn tasty, so I might have to go back and try some of those.

As far as the baked goods, we tried the chocolate chip cookies (without nuts), the blackout cookie, a pear and berry coffeecake and a fruit tart. Overall, I can’t really complain, but I can’t really dream about them either. They’re decent, but not amazing.

The cookies? Um. Well, they’re adequate. You can probably get some that are very similar from a grocery store.

The coffeecake was kind dry. This let me down the most. I get that coffeecake should be dry, as it goes with coffee, but it was dry to the tune of over-baked, not necessarily intentional.

As you might expect being in a growing area, the fruit tart had some decent fruit. Plus, the shell wasn’t too shabby, though the custard was a touch eggy.

Overall, adequate, but not spectacular.< /Text>

A friend of mine told me that their pastry and cakes are good (Also I check online they have good reviews) so I told my hubby to buy a 6-8 inch. round cake, white with strawberry filling and frosting. My hubby called me when he was in the cafe because he told me that the cake was expensive $34-44 but I told him it's ok because of my high expectation and thought with that price the cake will be good and delicious. I'm sorry but Royal Cafe and Bakery is over price and the cake is bad, the bottom of the cake is burned. I can't barely see the cake because of very very thick whip cream frosting (in other words, it's all whip cream) and the strawberry filling is sour. My husband told me,  "we got robbed!" We won't go back to this place, very disappointed! AND I tried the cookies and such, no special at all.</Text>

<Text>If you want to eat here, your better off getting Fish only as the chicken and beef have mostly fat and slime. Not a good place to eat. I was wondering why the drive through is always dead and A&W next door is always packed.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>The food was absolutely delicious but the best thing was when I got my dad to say a arigato (thank you in japanese) to the guy handing us the food. When my dad said it the guy was so surprised that he said that and didn't know what to do but laugh. Overall it was a great experience. 😋< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJGFL_0F_tj6_yvpryNjWQ7uD7btMQvnI1oJPs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0_nl2AvcxeUjiiKdNmW2YDkhxNz9SlumzAqnC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMUsWsZCrlTsUrJB_ICyqoM41rnvkz_wKQhZT7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80952f78933fb97f:0xa79c82238fe3f2f7</GmapID></record>

Good place. Food is okay, but the beef is on the oily-sweet side.
UPDATE: Maybe don't go here. I ate here at about noon, and I've been feeling nauseous all afternoon.<//Text>

It’s food, it’s edible, but if you have a choice there are better options. Rice is actually good but the chicken tastes like it was reheated from the grocery frozen section. Sauces are way too sweet. Orange chicken tastes exactly like fish for some reason. I’d recommend Masaru’s although this location is inevitably going to be more convenient for most.</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Went there when it first open a few months ago and it was the Yoshinoya we remembered and loved. But on my recent visit the food has definitely gone down hill. The beef bowl was so greasy and the rice was old. I really hope they bring back the quality food that Yoshinoya is known for. I will give it a try agian in a few weeks and will update my review accordingly.</text>< Pics>

Pricey for the amount you get. Have to re examine order to be sure everything ordered is in the take out. Has been a time or two that we didn't get everything ordered. Tastes more like Chinese food.< /Text>

< Review>
I just love that they made a Yoshinoya here in Visalia now I don't have to go really far just to go get some. I think right it's only drive thru but the food is still so good that it makes for not being able to dine in. However, when they do dine in I'm pretty sure it'll be perfect to go eat there but overall I love this place real good Japanese fast food restaurant.</Review>

First time customer, easy to order. Pick an entree or two, and choose a side. Food was good, service was great but took a long time to prepare. Not sure if this is usual but willing to go back for some more.< /Review>

Went into this thing positive hoping all the reviews were wrong... Turns out the meat taste like warmed up lunch meat... The orange chicken was okay.. clam chowder tasted fishy and old.. fried rice was good if it wasn't smothered in orange chicken sauce. Yha not good at all.<//Review>

I have loved Yoshinoya beef bowl for decades but this locations service has always been poor. Slow, left my single bowl waiting in the window for 5 full minutes before taking my money and handing to me. Didn't put the extras in the bag....and more.<//Review>

The girl taking my order was a fabulous person! The food tho isn’t memorable. I won’t buy again, the food(teriyaki  chicken, veggies, noodles & spring rolls) lacks flavor. Masaru’s off noble is way more flavorful of food. Sorry Yoshinoya.... just not good food🤷🏻‍♀️< /text>

<review>This is the worst food I’ve ever had in my life! I wouldn’t even eat here if I was starving. We ordered 3 plates and each tried different meats and they were all awful! I’m not even sure if the meats were what they said they were. I swear that chicken must have had a disease because I’ve never seen what they claimed to be chicken like that in my life. And when my fiancée took a bite of it, there was something hard in it and he immediately spit it out.

So many reviews talked up the freshness of the food served. I received what seemed to previously frozen soggy veggies and orange chicken balls that are breaded so heavily I couldn't find the chicken. Just a ball of battery mush that also had the texture of being out of the freezer. Over all everything was gross and warm at best. My husband ordered the steak and the taste good but was very tough and chewy. Definitely will not be spending money here again.</Text>

They were stingy with the vegetables as well. The only thing that was mildly okay were the spring rolls. If you want Japanese, don’t come here. Talk about false advertising!

Disappointing , my first time there and everything would add a price. I ordered a combo but then it would be extra charge , i asked for sweet and sour they replay it was extra charge ..... Then went home 12 miles away and the taste had to much ingridients..... Personally panda is my choice......   I know that every body has different taste buds.......that is my opinion</review>

Horrible service, orders completely incorrect from what was ordered. You're just better off going to panda express. This place is nothing to rave about ! Food was bland! The habanero chicken is the only item that has flavor on the menu. You are wasting your time and money if you come here! Rude customer service as well.<//text>

<text>Worst orange chicken I've ever had from any restaurant. Soggy, too much breading, flavorless blobs of chicken. The chow mein was overwhelmingly sweet. Just pure sugar taste with a hint of soy sauce. The whole meal was absolutely terrible. I'm never eating from here again.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>I got the 2 protein bowl (teriyaki chicken &  chilli shrimpon rice with mixed veggies). The chicken wasn't sliced through which isn't a big deal if that was the only thing wrong but the rice was crunchy And the veggies were spongy like frozen vegetables  . There was nothing else on the menu i was interested in trying so I didn't ask for a trade but really I didn't think it would get any better. I won't be back.<//text>< GmapID>

The steamed rice was hard as pop rock ,

orange chicken was good
the tilapia a little dry .

Teriaki chicken didn't taste teriaki, tasted salty..
Donut dippers tasted like stale oil.

I  would be willing to give one more try, i hope to change this review.</review>

The spring rolls, shrimp, and orange chicken were a little soggy, but still had great flavor. Unfortunately the grilled BBQ beef was almost entirely fat from the meat! The vegetables were just fried cabbage and carrots. Nothing looked as it did in on the menu. Very disappointed.</text>

Ok where do I start.....
Orders wrong ... my husband asked for noodles... they gave him "steamed rice" the so called steamed rice was as if they just threw raw rice on a plate and let it soak in the juices of the meats...hard as rocks. The "teriyaki" chicken had no teriyaki flavor just tasted like chicken  with soy sauce ...super salty. Veggies soggy frost bitten mush, no flavor. I called to let them know our rice was hard and our order was wrong, they never answered.</Text>

Terrible asked for extra meat and that did not happen after asking 3 times. The amount of meat received was completely unacceptable and tried to call to complain and no answer to the phone call.</review>

<text>The food they serve disgraces the yoshinoya's company. It ruins the good memories I ate down south where the quality is fresh and satisfying. I received a beef bowl which the beef was hardly cooked and seasoned, the noodles where bland and mushy, the vegetables were just undesirable to eat. It felt like a frozen meal that was put in a microwave. I honestly did not expect to receive a horrible meal. How unfortunate. Now I'm thinking twice if I want to come back.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Well, it's been a long long time since I've been here and the food has not changed. It's not great food. I got food here because my wife wanted to try it and the kids had never eaten here before. They were not impressed and will definitely not be back to this place or any Yoshinoya.< /Text><response>None</response></record>

<review>So the line took ages and they got my order wrong. I ordered original beef and received the teriyaki chicken , which I didn't realize until I got home. On top of that , the food was ... Okay. The sauce was just a tad too sweet and the chicken still had tendons which kind of put me off. I was really looking forward to the beef, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.

There was also a board covering up a window , which gave the place a good ghetto-esque style. For a place that just opened, y'all need to get your junk together.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Drivthru was packed so I went inside where there was only a few people.  Ordered several things, had coupons,  because we wanted to try them.  Here's our opinion:
Beef is very stringy and lacking flavor, Bbq beef is a little better, Teriyaki  chicken is fatty with chunks of gooey skin still on, Orange chicken edible but not great, veggies on the raw side, noodles yuck, etc. Will never go again<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I had the combo bowl with 2 meats, rice, and veg. I underestimated the portion size, when I opened it I scoffed at it but 3/4 in I'm like, huh, it's actually enough and I'm a big guy. I got the original beef which is delicious! I will say, it's a little on the greasy side but it just has this taste i crave after a while. The yakiniku/BBQ beef is the same except saucy and sweet. I had the spring rolls, they're great but overpriced. Overall, I wanted more Japanese items like ramen, gyoza, takoyaki, and mochi sweets but I'll take what I can get. The original beef is in my opinion they're only saving grace.< /Review>

Been twice. First time we had teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. Rice was good veggies ok. Second time we had shrimp and steak bowls. Shrimp was ok and steak very grissily. We got one bite of broccoli and one bite of carrot and the rest cabbage. People working there were very nice!! Won’t go back!!! 🤨< /Text>

My honest review!!!!!
Where do I start...
1) Orange Chicken- Walmart’s bagged orange chicken taste 100 times better.
2) Habanero Chicken- Sauce tastes like they just went into a grocery store and bought a bottle of habanero and just poured it over.
3) Noodles- Had no flavor.
4) Spring Rolls- 🤦🏻‍♀️ I was barely able to bite into them with how stiff and chewy they were.
SPRING ROLL SAUCE TASTES AWFUL
5) The soda tasted amazing 😋

The question of the day would be, “Would I come back again?” 🤔 NO.< /Text>

Very very slow drive thru!!!! It took almost an hour!!!  People that went in to order were in and out fast !!! And the food was terrible. You cannot  chew on the steak ($1 extra)  or the original beef and the color of beef was white. And it is way too expensive almost $10. Not coming back.<//review>

For the price point you are basically paying for a bowl of rice with a smidge of topping. Maybe a tbs of coleslaw and 3 bites of meat. Not worth the price compared to just about all other choices in existence.<//review>

It's very difficult find honest companies that provide quality work. I was referred to Platinum Home Remodeling by my friend, and I'm glad I called them. The bathroom remodel done with great quality, and the price was quite competitive. I am so happy with the result that I will recommend them to all of my friends and family members and everyone wanting to remodel their home. I'm very happy with the work and would hire them again in the future.< /Text>

<text>Roofing is always a great job, so I wanted to hire a contractor that would do a great job and make sure the job was done right the first time. I found Platinum Home Remodeling to be the best option for my project. I immediately contacted them, consulted with them over the phone, and I knew I made the right choice. Within the next few hours, they sent a team to my house, and within a week or so, I had a beautiful roof. Thank you guys for the excellent service and great work; I definitely recommend Platinum Home Remodeling.<//text><Rating>5</Rating><Time>1623668827757<//Time><resp>{'time': 1623696598181, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing Platinum Home Remodeling!'}</resp><user_id>103675935823760714150< /user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x80c297c74b74d2f1:0x9792818fc36c5b6b</gmapID></record>

When my parent's house needed some work done on the roof, plumbing, and room additions, I hired Platinum Home Remodeling. Understanding the complications of the project, they went above and beyond to get the job done. From the very beginning, this company was professional and ensured they delivered a good job. Their workers, too, were excellent. I am happy to say the project was done on time and the final result was fantastic. I highly recommend this company.< /Text>

I have nothing but good things to say about Platinum Home Remodeling and my bathroom project. From my first meeting with Eran when getting estimates to the final day of the project, I didn't have a moment of apprehension. The design was exactly what I had wanted and then some. And the price was right in line with what I was expecting. Eran brought ideas to the table that I hadn't thought of and, at the same time, showed me places I could save money and still get what I envisioned. One of my favorite parts of the project was watching the level of craftsmanship of the people doing the work. And I was very fortunate to have Sarah working as the Project Manager. She kept me so well informed every step of the way and was amazing in her ability to communicate my wants and concerns to the people doing the work. My bathroom is perfect beyond my expectation, and I would and will hire them again.<//text>

Our aged kitchen had many problems. From rusty spouts to worn-out countertops, the whole room was in need of a remodel. After a lot of discussion and research, we decided to go with Platinum Home Remodeling, and I'm glad we did. They were able to give us a great price on a kitchen remodel, and everything they did turned out beautifully. The work was done on time, and the result was amazing. Every single person on their team was professional and courteous; they really are a great company to work with.</Review>

After we had a new member of the family, my husband and I decided to remodel our guest room. Platinum Home Remodeling, with their experts, helped us remodel our guest room. From start to finish, they made this process stress-free and easy. They showed up when they said they would. They did all the work that they promised and were so easy to communicate with. I highly recommend them for any remodeling needs you may have.</review>

<Review>We all know that having our home remodeled takes time and money, but that doesn't mean it should be a hassle. We called Platinum Home Remodeling, and they worked hard to make our house look better than new. They did a great job, the pricing was fair, and that's not all. They finished the job in the time they promised and cleaned up after every phase of the remodeling. I would highly recommend this company if you're thinking about remodeling your home.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1622570689626, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing Platinum Home Remodeling!'}</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I had a bathroom remodel done by Platinum Home Remodeling, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. From the design to the actual construction, everything was done so well and exceeded my expectations. The design is impeccable, and the price was better than expected.

< Review>
Our new home construction project with Platinum Home Remodeling was an amazing experience. They had our home built on time, on budget, and with absolutely no issues. There were minor hiccups but what's important is the quality and satisfaction of their work. I had an easy time communicating with them throughout the entire project, and there was never any hesitation in communication or lack of knowledge. All of their workers were polite, punctual, and cleaned up after themselves. The final result was a home that's exactly what we wanted, and we're so happy with our house. I recommend this company to anyone in need of new construction or remodeling!< /Review>

<Text>When my parent's house needed some work done on the roof, plumbing, and room additions, I hired Platinum Home Remodeling. Understanding the complications of the project, they went above and beyond to get the job done. From the very beginning, this company was helpful and ensured they delivered a quality job. Their workers, too, were excellent. I am happy to say the project was done on time and the final result was excellent. I highly recommend this company.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c297c74b74d2f1:0x9792818fc36c5b6b</gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_id>

When I was planning on remodeling my kitchen, I didn't know where to start. After talking to several companies, I found Platinum Home Remodeling. The company was professional, and their prices are very reasonable. The work was done in a timely manner, and the quality was amazing. From the initial phone call to the finished project, everything went smoothly. I'm glad I chose this company and would gladly recommend them to anyone looking for home remodeling.<//Review>

<text>Working with Eric and his team from Platinum Home Remodeling was a real pleasure. From our first meeting with Eric, we were impressed with his knowledgeable and their standards of customer satisfaction. He asked us some questions about what we wanted in a kitchen. We worked closely with the project manager, Eric, all of their workers are clean, friendly, willing to answer questions, and care about your home. In the end we now have a beautiful dream kitchen, even better than we ever imagined. Thank you!<//text>< pictures>

A really professional company, exceptional above and beyond! Eric our project manager was excellent, during the work were missing tiles for the kitchen and he drove to the warehouse and made sure to bring it so the work would not be delayed. The professionals he brought were amazing and he did everything with patience. It was really important to him that we will be happy. I will hire Platinum for more work in the future. We recommend to hire Platinum!</Text>

The main reason we chose to go with Platinum was Guy our project manager. He was always available for us and providing updates. We received quotes from many different general contractors and Platinum was the most professional. We are very happy with our walk in remodel our kitchen and would definitely work with Platinum again.</Text>

I am very happy with this company! I had all my 3 bathrooms remodeled by Sharon and the team. It was a super solid experience working with them.
Sharon was helpful with the designs that I had to chose.
Everything was impeccably done to code.
We are grateful for the recommendation we originally received and will recommend them as well!< /Review>

It is so nice to know that when we need work to be done on time and there are still honest people out there. We called to Platinum Home Remodeling and David come by. He immediately get up on the roof to see the damage. David super knowledgeable and professional. He actually visit daily onsite to make sure the crew is doing the job. We are very happy with the work David and his crew have done on the roof. We will recommend to all of our friends and families.< /review>

<review>First I want to say big thank you to Tony from Platinum for the excellent work he has done in my bathroom. I've been searching for a good remodeling contractor to work with for a long time, I have decided to go with Platinum Home Remodeling.

Shirley (project manager) did a fantastic remodeling job in our house. It included a complete kitchen remodel and removal of two walls. Shirley helped us merge our visions and turned it into something my husband and I love. The crew has been always kind, very respectful and hard-working. When we tell people about our remodeling project, we hear about their terrible experiences. We always say that's because you didn't get to work with Shirley.
We really enjoyed the remodel, when we will ready for our bathroom remodel, we definitely be calling Platinum Home Remodeling (Shirley).</Text>

I don't think 5 stars is enough to Platinum Home Remodeling. I called to Platinum Home Remodeling for set up an appointment that fit my busy schedule. David came by and gave me the best options for new countertops. David gave us many tips while helping us. After we made our decision, they came over and measured the space to ensure the countertops we ordered fit perfectly. David set up a date for installing countertops and were on time, the fit and finish was perfect. We had the best experience with David (Platinum Home Remodeling) very professional, timely & friendly.</Review>

<review>I can't say enough good things about this company.
Platinum Home Remodeling remodeled three of our bathrooms in a house, Edi made us felt so comfortable throughout the process and always informed us on the status regarding our bathrooms. This place was by far the most professional and knowledgeable company we met, highly recommend!</review>< pics>

< Review>
I don't think 5 stars is enough to Platinum Home Remodeling. I called to Platinum Home Remodeling for set up an appointment that fit my busy schedule. David came by and gave me the best options for new countertops. David gave us many tips while helping us. After we made our decision, they came over and measured the space to ensure the countertops we ordered fit perfectly. David set up a date for installing countertops and were on time, the fit and finish was perfect. We had the best experience with David (Platinum Home Remodeling) very professional, timely & friendly.</Review>

Fresh pizza, amazing taste, great ingredients. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. Inside is clean and well kept. Bummed that the lunch buffet isn't running due to COVID but that's not their fault. The pizzas we got were cooked to order and to perfection. We'll definitely be coming back.</review>

If I spend $40 on One pizza pie it should be special and it was not. I got the Mount Everest which is supposed to be stacked with everything.  It lacked all flavor, l mean  go to melo's Pizza & order a pizza with those ingredients
This  had half the meat that the picture indicated that it would have been ok but even then to make matters worse the meat had no flavor if I was to buy this at Melo's every piece of linguica would taste like linguica and pepperoni, pepperoni. This just tasted boring and required a lot of salt and garlic just  to get it to taste reasonable.

On top of that at 1:30 p.m. The person handling the transaction was rude and rushing my decision, I'm positive it was the same person that handled pick up. I could tell when he refused to deliver it during the ordering because he said it would take an hour and a half to deliver but I can pick it up if I wanted in 15 minutes what a bunch of bull the place was dead there was no one in there no one checking cleanliness or mask-wearing on the way in.  No offer of condiments or napkins or a bag or help out to the car since I had two really large boxes... Suffice to say the service was terrible.

Yeah this place was pretty disappointing, I still might change it to 1 star, and I will not be back sorry to say.<//review>

<text>Came here after getting a flat tire fixed at Les Schwab and tried their buffet. The interior of the place is small but has a very homely sort of feeling. The pizza was phenomenal crunchy crust, silky smooth cheese, the pepperoni was nice and crunchy with that little spice punch in it, and the tomato sauce was not bland and not acidic It had just right amount of spices in the taste and the creamy texture to it. I do plan on coming back here again when I’m in the area.<//text><username>Rail Road Kid</username><gmapID>0x8085566dd99773db:0x462bfc7c03a275ab< /gmapID>< resp>

< review>
I eat there at least once a week. Manager is very friendly despite what others would have you believe and he even lowers the price on my orders for being such a frequent customer. Also they have only ever gotten my order wrong once in like 3 years or so of eating there pretty much every week often times more than once (it was a new employee taking my order over the phone and they were very busy at the time so pretty much what you'd expect anyways). Really don't get all the crap this place is getting from some people. Believe it or not they get really busy sometimes and have trouble doing everything at the same level of quality they normally have with their small staff of like 3-6 people (but that doesn't happen often enough to warrant hiring more people however).<//review>

Hella good. BBQ chicken pizza is smackin. Beer is a bit over priced but it is what it is. Salads are good. Ranch dressing is really good too. The got some games for the kids and you can rent a room for a team meeting or whatever. Peace</text>

Instead of just charging me for extra topping they wanted to bring up everything and my order separate. Therefore jacking up the price. What a bunch of rip offs.

Pizza was delicious but the salad bar needs to be improved. Everything was old and mushy. Lettuce was brown and wilted. The staff are friendly and helpful.</review>

<Date>1618512550823<//Date><text>Solare was our first dining-out experience right after the county gave the greenlight to greater opening. We still dined outside on one of their lovely terraces, with heaters to keep us warm.

Their food remains top-notch and the service excellent. We shared a bottle of well-priced Saddleback Zinfandel, which matched beautifully with our pasta dishes, a meat lasagna and pasta with bolognese sauce. We also enjoyed the desserts, a creme brulee with pistachios and a tiramisu.

Excellent meal -- we'll be back. And the friendly staff are extremely conscientious about public health and safety measures.</text>< Response>

They have a pretty diverse menu, and they also had several dinner specials not listed on their regular menu, which makes for a nice surprise. Will add to my places to visit again.<//Text>< pics>

<text>My husband and I had dinner at Solare for a little date night. We ventured out of East Village because we've heard great things about this place.

The food was delicious. We had the Classic Pappardelle Bolognese and Risotto Tartufo e Capesante and both were tasty. 5 out of 5.

The reason I give it a 3 star because of two reasons:

1) The service fell short of anything good. Our server took our order and that was really it. Didn't check in on us after that.

2) I received my glass of wine in a filthy glass. When I say filthy, I'm pretty sure it wasn't washed. Then my husband's silverware also had dried up food. I'm surprised with Covid this was an issue. Should be top of mind.

We did share this feedback with the manager, and he seemed appalled. Sounded like he'll take action, though.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80deab0424098d6b:0xad7ea551b3f5c87</GmapID></record>

Amazing restaurant. Great food, great service and great wine selection. Try to get their cellar room for a cozy and more intimate environment. everything we tried there was delicious</text>

By far one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever attended. If you have never been, I highly recommend you stop by. The calamari and shrimp appetizer with vegetables was delicious! And the tiramisu was the best I have ever had! I for sure will be back!<//Review>

Missed the mark. The evening started good with the owner/manager greeting us at the door but quickly went down hill. Service was abysmal, and only one of four people liked their entree. I will say the marsala  sauce was good but it was the only thing making the way over cooked chicken palatable. I would have probably just told the owner/manager about our experience and moved on but I could not find him nor any other server on our way out. There are a lot of other "authentic" italian restaurants out there, which if nothing else, would be happy to serve customers.< /Text>

<review>There are a ton of great reviews on here so maybe we got takeout on an off night. The food was undercooked (such chewy pasta!) and super over-seasoned (it's the next day and I can still only taste saffron). The food was incredibly simple for what we paid, almost like they were running out of standard ingredients. The pick up experience wasn't great. Part of the reason we picked this place was because the website mentioned a wine shop and assistance picking out a bottle in our price range. The woman was unhelpful and didn't listen. She just started listing out all the bottles around the price we wanted without guiding us to something we'd like. With two other sensational Italian places just up in Point Loma, we'll probably stay away from Solare. Really bad first impression.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Came to Solare after we could not find parking in little Italy. I've heard good things, and I'm glad they could seat us almost right away on a Saturday night around 8. We both were very happy with our entrees, lasagna and a vegetarian pasta with tomatoes and pesto. Service was a bit on the slow side considering they were not extremely busy. We asked for the bread and olive oil which came out well after the salad. Overall the food was very good and I would come back!<//Review>< gmap_id>

<review>Love this place.  Great fresh pasta, imaginative dishes.  Location is nice -- Liberty Station is easy to navigate and parking is plentiful.  The proprietors have been tirelessly adapting to the government's ever changing COVID restrictions.< /review>< Pictures>

Food was good and service was even better. I tried the meatballs and the fried risotto balls. The white bean soup with shrimp was also good. The focaccia was excellent. I sat outside on their porch and the portable heater made the experience just right. I really like Liberty Station. It’s the perfect mix of art and museums and food.<//text>

<Review>Might not be fair to rate this place right now considering the must for outside seating. We stayed because there was no wait for a party of 4 at 6:30 on on a Saturday. They were upfront and told us the only seating available was on the grass with no heat lamps. This of course is because of the rules surrounding social distancing and the restaurant is doing their best to add outside seating. No surprise, we got a bit cold. Not the restaurant's fault. The location is right under the airport takeoff flight path. We had to halt conversation or yell with some of the takeoffs. Kind of cool at first, but not after awhile. Again, not the restaurant's fault. Service was a bit slow. This may have been due to the increased distance servers needed to travel from kitchen or bar to table. Busing of the table was a bit incomplete. For some reason when he removed things from our table he neglected to take the empty beer can (x 2) and water bottle cap. The food was good but not exceptional. Years ago we ate here and I recall really enjoying it. I would eat here again even with the 3 stars I gave this visit for the overall experience. It was still good to be outside and enjoying a meal with friends during this crazy COVID-19 time.</Review>< Rate>

Good food. Enjoyed the rack of lamb very much. The fish was also good. First bite of the pistachio creme brulee was tasty, but started to feel the dense texture at following bites. It probably would be better if I had coffee to go with it.  The pace is slow. Not good for eating before scheduled events unless you give ample time. I would go back in the future to try other dishes.< /text>

What a fantastic dining experience! The apps and entrees were gorgeous and delicious! Nice ambiance inside, but like all of Liberty Station, don’t dine outside unless you like the sound of planes taking off. My only “meh” moment was the tiramisu; it’s served in a clay flower pot, which reminded me of that dirt cake that’s popular for elementary school kids. Dessert aside, great menu and I recommend for a delicious date night!< /text>

This is the best Chicago-style deep dish I've had outside of San Diego, CA period. The sausage is fresh and perfectly seasoned, and the vegetables are cooked to the perfect temperature in the pie. Magnificent sauce that's not too sweet, the way they truly do it in the Chi. Fairly priced, and solid beer selection on top of it.<//text>

The staff was very nice! But the food was mediocre. I've had better spaghetti out of a great values can and better fettuccine at olive garden. Bread was stale too. The waiters/waitresses were great! But they should work on the cooks. Staff was wearing gloves (which is good) but they were brushing their hair with their gloves on.</text>

We drove over 20 miles each way to dine at Solare for a special-occasion dinner, based on previous experiences there with great food, including one during COVID restrictions in Oct. 2020.  This time we were very disappointed and came away annoyed.
First problem was that the waiter explained we couldn't get an Arnold Palmer, because they can't serve anything from a pitcher due to COVID restrictions. (Okay fine, but why not have bottled ice tea and lemonade in the kitchen in the interim?).  Bottled water was the option for the non-wine-drinkers, so we ordered a bottle, which was one glass each, and were never offered another until we had to ask for one late in the meal.  (Despite the empty bottle sitting on the end of the table through the meal.)
No bread was offered to the table at all.  Most respectable Italian restaurants provide it, or at least offer it.
We ordered the only two appetizers on the menu. One was Bruschetta ($16) which came with 3 tasty spreads but only 7 very small bits of toast about 1 1/2 inches square, You'd think that for a party of 4, you could afford to  put out 8 or 12 bits of toast so everyone could have a few pieces (they were too small to break in half...).  7 pieces?   The other was the charcuterie (another $16 - unless you want cheese with it, which adds $6 for what I'd assume is a few small slices of cheese, judging from the small portions of the three meat selections).
I ordered the lamb shank ($36), described as "Incredible" on the menu. It was very small.  I’ve had chicken legs with more meat than this shank.
The others’ entrees were quite small as well, and all took a very long time to be served. No one mentioned that their entree was anything special, and this group would normally say so.
The waiter never checked with us to ask “Is everything okay?” or “How was everything?”
Maybe he already knew.
Not sure what’s happened to this place.<//review>

The service was exceptional. No more than a 10 minute wait. Our group included 5 people. 2 kids, 3 adults. The waitresses and waiters and very kind. When I received my food,  it was DELICIOUS. I was in love with the cornbread crust of the deep dish pizza. No complaints. Very Good!!<//text>

< Review>
Food and wine was really good. Service was great. Risotto and vegetables were delicious, starting pizza was great. Signature dish on the menu was the steak. Was slightly underdone for my preference, almost cold in the centre. I would eat there again, I just wouldn't order the steak.</Review>

Stopped for drinks and a bite before heading off to dinner. Drinks were good, and service was fast and friendly.

Lots of fun things to do and see in Liberty Station. Solare is a great little upscale eatery and they have a quiet little bar area if you just want to pop in.<//text>

Great takeout in the city. We've eaten in the restaurant a couple of times, the line can be incredibly long. I recommend going on the earlier side to beat the wait.< /Review>

We couldn't have asked for a better dining experience than the one we had last night. Tommy was a real expert with the wine and beer menu and guided me to the perfect beer. All of the staff was attentive to all of our needs and made sure that everything from the drinks to appetizers, entrees and dessert came out to our liking.

The focaccia is out of this world. I'd go back just for this alone. However, we had other awesome sides such as buratta and fried calamari. Each appetizer was genuinely good.

The main courses we had were cooked to perfection. Definitely one of the best risottos I have ever eaten. My wife had a pasta de mare that she thought was outstanding.

The restaurant is worthy of being a go-to spot when you are in the mood for Italian food. Great food, great service and a really reasonable price considering much of the ingredients are fresh and locally sourced.<//text>

<text>The most overpriced restaurant Ive been too considering I've had better microwave food and their main courses averaged 20 dollars; could not finish my starter or main it was so bad and I'm no picky eater smh. Not to mention you won't be able to hear the person siting right next to you because there are planes flying over the place every 5 minutes and thats not an exaggeration. But the service was good and the waiters were nice and helpful.<//text>< Pictures>

One of the best Italian restaurants in San Diego.  Excellent wine collection and great food. The private dining rooms are fantastic, nicely decorated and very well attended.  This place has quickly become a favorite stop for Italian.< /text>

We came for the San Diego Restaurant Week dinner menu. I had the octopus appetizer, and it was spectacular: poached in olive oil and then briefly fried, it was tender and flavorful, and accompanied with a tomato/olive/caper sauce. My spouse enjoyed the lobster bisque and then the fettuccine with shrimp. I had the fish of the day, which was ono. We tried both of the desserts: a panna cotta with a bittersweet chocolate sauce on the side (excellent) and a special cocktail. Neither of us cared for the gin-based concoction, but then, neither of us have a taste for gin.< /Text>

Excellent place. Moderately price, but Ossobucco is always a good helping and you won't be disappointed. Waiters and waitresses helped each other to ensure your needs were met. Parking is usually easy also at Liberty Station.< /Text>

<review>We always enjoy Solare. The food is excellent and so is the service. We started with the calamari appetizer; it was lightly battered and crispy. Then we moved to the Ceaser salad and then bean soup, both tasty  I had the fish special, which was grouper. It was perfectly cooked.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Drinks ordered at the bar may increase in price when moved to your table. Tonic for the Times is $9 at the bar; $10 at the table.  Some pasta portions are pretensiously small.  I overheard their Sommelier, and he seemed knowledgeable but never came by.  Bathrooms are for public use, and can be best described as high school in look and seemed to be tended to in a similar fashion.<//Text>< response>

The food was very good, but we've had much better at this price point and the portions were on the small side.  When you charge above average prices expectations are above average as well.  Again, the food was very good, but comparable to restaurants that are about 25% less expensive.  The service was warm, friendly and attentive.  We love trying new places, so no regrets, but definitely not worth a return visit.</text>

The sauce for the chicken was exactly what I was looking for. There is a flavorful excitement. The chicken had all the flavors throughout the meat. Cutlets were cook very tender. The potatoes and vegetables were done to perfection.
Desert of Tira Misu was very good but the topping of sugar was a little coarse for me.

The food here goes above and beyond what ever words are used to describe it. We have enjoyed everything on the menu and appreciate the lengths chef Arcusio et al, has gone to, to source, honor, and prepare each ingredient. One of our favorites is the risotto with scallops. It is not to be missed, the scallops are seared to perfection and the risotto is creamy and flavorful while not being "heavy". The cocktails are a phenomenon on their own, and are worth exploring in depth.  The service is immaculate and deserves to receive equal adulation. All the awards they have received are proof that we are not alone in our opinions and I am grateful they have received such  accolades. Most importantly though, is the way the staff treats you like your family which proves you can enjoy world class cuisine in SD without any of the pretentiousness.<//text>

<text>Amazing, delicious food with phenomenal wines. We sat at the Chef's table and had a four or six course tasting menu. The lamb was amazing, honestly, EVERYTHING was amazing! We also came back for a cooking class a month or so later and it was super fun, informative, and then we sat down for lunch together. The food was of course delicious. Everyone is friendly, from the owner Randy to the folks bussing the tables. Chef Phillipo is great, and sous chef Denise makes amazing food too. Love it!< /text>< Pictures>

I used Doordash and got the Pappardelle Agnello and Tiramisu while the pasta was good, and Tiramisu was OUT OF THIS WORLD good, it was a pretty expensive buy and i was really hoping for the bread that you get when you dine in (according to the pictures). I would give it 4.5 stars if i could!</Text>

My girlfriend and I went recently for her birthday and we cannot say enough good things. Wanting badly to get away from the chain restaurant experience, we were not disappointed. From the friendly and helpful host and server to the delicious food and wine, Solare is a must try. I know nothing about Italian wine. Our server helped me find a great bottle which complimented an incredible prepartion of Tuscan lamp chops. We'll be back soon to eat and for a cooking class which they offer!<//text>

<review>I went on the Solare website looking for a place my husband and I could walk to from our home in Loma Portal for New Years Eve. We wanted a nice dinner and then planned to go home and enjoy the rest of our night in front of our fireplace with our own champagne. Nowhere on their website did it say that there was going to be a MANDATORY NEW YEARS EVE MENU STARTING AT $85/PERSON... NOWHERE....  I pressed the reserve table tab, not expecting ANY tables to be left but there were. I proceeded to book a table for two for 7:30PM, and AGAIN, NOWHERE DID IT SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A  MANDATORY NEW YEARS EVE MENU STARTING AT $85/PERSON, NOT INCLUDING DRINKS. NOWHERE.

We arrived at 7:15 and were made to wait until 7:30 to be seated, even though our table was clearly ready and waiting upon our arrival, and AGAIN NOWHERE DID IT SAY ANYWHERE AT THE RECEPTION DESK OR ENTRY THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A  MANDATORY NEW YEARS EVE MENU STARTING AT $85/PERSON. We were seated and asked for the regular menu, as there was only a long card of what we thought were specials, and NOTHING on that menu was "special" in any way believe me...., only to be told that that was our only option and it would be $85 each, plus whatever drinks we wanted.... We left....AND WILL NOT BE COMING BACK DESPITE LIVING 8 BLOCKS AWAY....GET OVER YOURSELVES, YOUR FOOD IS NOT ITALIAN, AND IT IS NOT THAT GOOD....

SEE YA, OH WAIT, YOU WON'T BE.....< /review>< pics>

We came in last minute before closing.  I know that shouldn't make a difference we did feel like we got a half hearted attempt at a meal.  Thinks we okay at best but the place was beautiful. I think the food could have been good but part of the meal tasted like it had been sitting around for several hours.  4 stars was giving them benefit of the doubt because we were so late in the evening<//text>

<review>We tried Solare on our anniversary, I had seen other views about poor service & small portions but that was not our experience at all. Our server, Alex, was superb. Timely, made great suggestions. He was very knowledgeable of both the food and beverage menus. I have a food allergy and he and the chef where on top of it. I noticed very attentive wait staff at other tables as well. I'm not sure about the complaints about portion size. My wife and I felt the portions where great for the rich Italian cuisine. Desserts where epic too!
We will definitely be back! Great location too. Always ample parking and a fun place to walk around, before or after.</review>< pics>

Well made and prompt. The servers were friendly and attentive. I also didn't have a problem finding parking nearby. The beverage menu has a nice selection. The interior has a very intimate atmosphere while the outdoor seating is light and a little more casual.< /review><username>Melissa Murphy</username><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

This place SUCKS!!!! Six of us went there for dinner.  If you want water, better bring your own. The water glasses are very small so after 2 drinks,  your glass is empty and they refill it every 30 minutes. The waiter forgot one of our orders so only 5 dishes came out. I paid $22 for a bland piece of lasagna. Absolutely no flavor.  I've had better lasagna in my high school cafeteria. Save your money and avoid this place. It's definitely not worth it.< /text>

<Text>This place was so yummy.  The service was spectacular and the settings were so nice. It feels like a five star with the inviting sense of a family run business. The questions about the food and service did not feel complacent, it felt purposeful, and they really cared. I had the ravioli and an espresso after dinner.  I am definitely coming back here to try something else on the menu.  Savory tastes and spectacular service. Love it here.<//Text><time>1526695498311< /time></record>

<user_name>John Caldwell<//user_name><text>We were with a large party who reserved the outside patio.  I don't recommend reserving the patio if you are doing anything but drinking, because there just isn't enough room.

It was buffet style with a single pasta (penne with meat sauce), two salads (a Caesar and a baby greens salad with strawberries and blue cheese), with tea, soda, and water included.  The food was good, but not for the $30 per person price tag plus 20% gratuity on top of that and whatever it cost to reserve the space.  I was surprised there was no bread.

The service was terrible.  You had to get your own water at a station on the patio; and yes, the glasses are small.  If you wanted tea or soda, you had to go to the bar and get it yourself.  The only service provided was bussing the dirty plates off of the tables, and they were very slow at that.  Ten percent is the traditional buffet tip, so I have no idea how they felt the service we received was worth 20%.

I can't speak to normal dining, but absolutely do not recommend going here with a large party.<//text>< Date>

<Text>Food and service on an extraordinary level. I was very impressed by the level of professionalism amongst its staff. I highly recommend the Filetto di Manzo, their Angus beef roast medium rare if you're a steak lover, but truthfully this is one of those places where I'm sure whatever you order is sure to change your life. I made sure to save room for dessert and was glad we went with the tiramisu as that is magic, not only because it tastes magical, but because they create the illusion of a potted plant as their presentation. They also have an excellent wine and dessert wine selection.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80deab0424098d6b:0xad7ea551b3f5c87< /gmapID></record>

<Review>Very good, high end Italian restaurant. They do have very small portions, which keeps me from not coming back more often. All the food dishes I've had has lots of flavor and taste high quality, but you will not be full and at $20-30 dishes, this is a little upsetting. Both me and my girlfriend ate all our food and we're still hungry after and this was during Restaurant Week, which means we had 3 courses and still didn't get full! Visited this place, not during restaurant week and again enjoyed my pasta dish but was left wanting more. You do get complimentary bread, but it's nothing too special. They have a great selection of wines, especially the Italian ones. The best part is on Tuesdays it's half off bottles of wine under $80. You can get some really high end wine for a great price! They also have happy hour everyday, which I hear is a very good deal. Very friendly staff and the restaurant environment is very romantic, a good place to take a date.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

So disappointing... very friendly staff , really small portions, party of 8, took for ever to just get bread and we recieve one serving. I would thnk that for the prices when the bread is gone they would replenish.  Nothing comes with the meal,  just not the Italian restaurant good as s style we are use to.  Not impressed.< /text>

The wine was great, service was great, the food was not :( had the Bruschetta as our app and it was all way too sweet. I had the risotto with truffles, scallops and lobster roe, except there was no roe, the risotto was under cooked and scallops were way over cooked and only seared on one side. Husband had the lamb which came out well done. Sad because it was good quality meat, just a poor cook on it. Dessert had the pistachio creme brûlée which was yummy except for the burnt sugar (over charred). Disappointing.<//text>

<text>I really love this spot!  I would love to give it 5 stars cuz I really believe the taste of their food most times is very delicious.  But, the price point for the portion may be a bit off as well as service never totally impresses me.  Their lasagna is delicious.  They were great for restaurant week.  Although they ran out of one of their appetizers by 7:30 pm on the first night and didn't bother to replace the choice which was kinda lame.  As well as the desert was not that tasty.  But half off bottles of wine $80 and under on Tuesdays and you can really try some great wines for cheap! This spot is also located in Liberty Station which is so cool!  I love the variety over there!</text><Date>1453359721278<//Date>< userid>

I have been here several times, and it's becoming one of my favorites in Point Loma.  The atmosphere is kind of dark and moody in a very good way.  The wine list is very nice across middle to higher price points.  I like to visit when I  have time to enjoy an appetizer and start a nice bottle before dinner.  I'm pleased with the pasta and meatballs dishes especially, and the pizza is good too.  It can be very busy on a weekend, but usually easy to get a table on a week night... They have a wine special one night, so check the web site for that.  It can get a little noisy if the place is full.  Enjoy!<//Review>

Came from out of state, we were looking forward to a delicious Italian dinner. What a DISAPPOINTMENT!! The  ambience was nice, service was horrible. Had a table of 12, had to wait for our food for a long period of time, one of our relatives did not get his food until we were all pretty much done, the other had to wait an extremely long time as well.  The waiter was extremely loud and rude! When ticket came for myself and husband, we were paying cash, he took cash and didnt come back. We had to go get our change, 15 minutes later.... I think he actually thought we were leaving him a $60.00 tip!! Food and service were not worth the price we paid. Bummed out on this end....😔< /text>

<text>I've been to this place 3 times. First 2 times was not bad but the 3-rd time we just wanted some desserts to go. Hostess was nice and tried to help us to pick the dessert. I had an e-gift card on my phone. And the first to times they took my phone somewhere to use the e-gift card and it took a bit too long around 6 min to do so. I didn't particularly like that there's a lot of sensettive information on it and it's all in hands of a person who you don't even know plus they take a while I get a bit worried. So the third time I came I said to the server "just don't take my phone away" and right after that manager came and grabbed my phone and took it with her to the office. That made me very uncomfortable and upset (tottaly ignored my request). Then I said to the server why did she take my phone I asked you not to do that. Which he answered "that's the only way we do it here" I said "I'm a server myself and once I had a similar situation and I asked the manager if I could take their phone and he said "you should never take their phone for what ever reason". But these guys do this like no big deal. What happens next the server starts to argue with me and says "do you want me to go and take it from the manager but you won't get your dessert cause that's the way we always do it here (unbelievable how rude he is), (another wards I felt like he wanted to say get the hall out of here with your gift card) At this point I'm really disappointed and frustrated with this experience so I regretted that I came here. I drowe almost 20 mii for this. Then I told the manager about the whole situation. She was apologetic and understanding. How can you be so rude to people if you are working as a server. I'd get in a lot of trouble if I treated my guest like that. All tho the desserts were good. But it's not only about the food. If the customer service is that terrible it doesn't matter how good everything else is. You can imagine how I feel about this to spend all this time to write this review😣 I guess it's because of my age (20s) or the way I was dressed (casually). It's too nice of a place for me to come and buy something here.</text>< pictures>

<Text>It saddens me, as a member of the culinary world to write this review. My boyfriend and i decided to try this place out for our special NYE dinner.  I guess , quite possibly, based on the reviews and the price of the dinner ($85/plate) we had decent expectation.

Conceptually, i think the food had the right idea. As well the right plating...everything was beautiful. The moment we started to devour these beautiful plates.. my taste buds started screaming. They were begging for more flavor, more salt, more sugar, literally more anything.

I claimed the pork tenderloin as my choice for the evening, and its texture was like it had been boiled. I could barely cut into it. The taste was bland, and the apples served with it were coated in a pan sauce i believe?  The sauce seemed like it needed to be reduced. The sauce was watery and tasted just like stock was poured over my plate. The apples that littered my plate had no texture, no flavor, and could have easily been misconstrued for potatoes.

My Boyfriend got enough gnocchi for two people, but again, it was beautiful they were prepared properly but lack luster in taste. The only thing we both liked this entire evening was the soup.

After working in this business, i understand the point of set menu on nights like NYE. I understand the limitations are to keep the night flowing smoothly and expedited on time.

I guess even tho the dessert wasn't bad, i expected more than ice cream.
Again the serving size was for two people.  I, an avid chocolate lover, felt like it was too much.

The one star is very deserving of the waitress. She was the only thing that kept me calm. She could tell i was displeased and she very graciously  added a discount to our bill.

Which brings me to the last point. On the bottom of the receipt, it has a (usually) handy tip calculator, i just wanted to add that it may need to be looked over. It was a tad incorrect ( by about $6).

But, i do feel like the team should be able to understand that at the end of the day , people are choosing to spend an important evening at your restaurant, make it worth their time. Otherwise, why else are you doing it?
I guess i'll end this with we were just Very disappointed and felt that we had been "duped" .<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

How dining should be...
Amazing food, incredible service, beautiful ambiance. Our server, Paula, was fantastic and made our night relaxing and easy.  The owner came over and served me a customized dessert for my birthday with the most delicious authentic italian gelato.  I dont take 5 stars lightly and this place earned it.  I would come back every day if we lived here.<//Text>

I'm giving 2 stars just for the atmosphere. Pizza was so skimpy on cheese and meat that even my 9 years old who "don't like much cheese" commented that it's too little - toppings were hardly covering 1/2 of the pizza.  They brought the bread and butter after we ate most of th pizza. To top it off - there was no salt and pepper on the table... I'm speechless...
Good looking restaurant, but poorly executed "Italian style service".< /Text>

< Review>
The food is awesome.  The wait staff is incredibly helpful. We sat at the bar because we were early for our reservation.  We sampled some wines and before we went to our table, the head wine sommelier was next to us helping us select the perfect bottle of wine.  Wow, what customer service.  We will be back soon and often.
Osseobucco is amazing</Review>

Ordered the "Drain the Swamp" martini that comes with gorgonzola stuffed olives, mine came with plain olives. I mentioned it to the waiter who quickly said he'd bring another 'on the house' and with the stuffed olives. He did, however when the bill arrived I was charged twice. It wasn't 'on the house'. As far as the food, I had the risotto with prawns, verdict - below average. My friend had the bouillabaisse and that was delicious. Overall impression, over priced and underwhelming. Won't be back.<//text>

Been there twice, both times the hostess was no where to be found. Bartender then seated us after about 10 minutes of waiting, after 15 minutes of being seated we finally had a waitress tell us they were no longer making food and that we can order drink at the bar. We came during open hours. Service was absolutely horrible. Kind of sad, heard really good things about this place. However will not go back only to be disappointed.< /Text>

<review>Wow wow wow. Some of the best Italian food I have had in la!! Only negative is really small, cramped and loud place. Also, quite pricey but quality is key. The free bread in beginning is addicting. Shared the prosciutto pizza and famous lasagna. The lasagna was literally to die for! Like last supper good! The pizza was perfectly cooked and tasty, as well! Nom nom more please!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80deab0424098d6b:0xad7ea551b3f5c87</Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Service was not great , The busser was very good and attentive but the server just was not attentive. Great wine selection . Most disappointing was the food I had the spaghetti with clams it was just ok my girlfriend had the raviolis just no flavor at all tasted like water. Bummer it was our 1 year aniversy😬</Review>

Been there twice, both times the hostess was no where to be found. Bartender then seated us after about 10 minutes of waiting, after 15 minutes of being seated we finally had a waitress tell us they were no longer making food and that we can order drink at the bar. We came during open hours. Service was absolutely horrible. Kind of sad, heard really good things about this place. However will not go back only to be disappointed.< /text>

<review>SO LOUD. We had a table of six women, between 33 & 45 years old. We couldn't hear ANYTHING anyone else was saying. Do not go until they install acoustical ceiling panels. Oh and they wouldn't seat us outside even though there was a six-top available.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Located in Liberty Station, the team at Solare have done a great job making the place elegant and welcoming. The place seems to be divided into two sections, with more formal dining to the left and the bar and additional seating on the right. Both offer the same great menu and ambiance. On certain nights, Solare has live entertainment which adds even more reasons to love this hidden gem in Point Loma.  If it's available, ask for the table in the wine cellar, it's a glass room in the middle of the restaurant that stocks an amazing selection of wine bottles to enjoy. You can also ask to be seated at the kitchen table where the chef can prepare selections for you to enjoy. A large private room for special events is available, and they have outside dining as well if that's more your thing. We're definitely coming back to Solare, as the food was by far some of the best we've had in Point Loma. (Happy Hour, by the way, is pretty great, too!)<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Located in Liberty Station, Solare Ristorante is an authentic Italian restaurant with a Sicily-born chef who executes southern Italian cuisine. In other words, if you're looking for "chicken parm" and "pasta primavera," look elsewhere!

I am picky about Italian, which is to also say that San Diego's mostly lame Italian options have been a source of frustration and angst since moving here last year. Solare is one of a handful of Italian restaurants in San Diego that could survive in New York City.

I recommend the "Tartara di Tonno," Solare's Sicilian interpretation of tuna tartare: a meaty cake of chopped raw ahi tuna with capers, horseradish, basil, and garlic. The vibrant pink color of this appetizer makes it as nice to look at as it is to eat.

Do you like meatballs? Try the "Polpette al Forno." The smooth texture and delicate flavor of these small Subway-sized veal meatballs are not lost in a thick marinara sauce, as they instead swim in a collagen-rich stock-y sauce that is lightly touched with tomato. The meatballs are topped with crispy arugula leaves and grated parmigiano reggiano.

The "Pappardelle Verdi Salsiccia e Carciofi" is a spicy pasta dish constructed with spinach pappardelle noodles, sweet fennel sausage, chopped artichokes, tomatoes, chilies, and covered in large, thin slices of pecorino crotonese cheese. Solare indicates that all pasta served during the course of a day is made from scratch that morning, and this is evident by the quality and freshness of their hefty and terrific pappardelle. The citrusy crotonese is the ideal cheese for this heavy (and oily) bowl of meat and noodles.

If you're looking for a heavier meal, you'll want to order the "Ossobuco di Maiale," which is very similar to a traditional ossobuco alla milanese, but with a 22oz Salmon Creek pork shank instead of the traditional veal shank. Braised meat rarely ever will be done better than it is here -- the meat was velvety, soft, rich, and had incredible flavor. The marinated cremini mushrooms were also insanely excellent, my only complaint being that there were just three of them on my plate. The shank itself rested on a bed of creamy risotto flavored with a tangy gremolata and a perfect amount of saffron.

The interior of the restaurant is stylish, with teak wood furnishings, stone accents, and a glass-enclosed cube-like wine room that separates the bar area from the dining room. There is also a ton of outdoor seating.

Solare is a fantastic destination in San Diego for Italian, as they have hit all the right notes on taste, presentation, creativity, price, decor, and service.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Solare excels in all respects as one of the best Italian fine dining establishments.

The restaurant is large and very well designed, featuring gorgeous private dining rooms with wine rack walls as well as a full bar and spacious dining areas.

The Staff recommended the Tasting Menu which consisted of:

Insalata-lettuce wedge in egg mouse with mustard seed caviar. This was a superb and memorable combination of flavors.

Ravioli in brown butter, sage, arugula with ricotta

Papardelle al Sugo di Salsiccia-house made pasta aged a year with sausages and pistachos. This dish is a winner featuring a delicious crunchiness and deep flavor.

The highlight was my first ever Hawaiian Monchong fish in smoked tomato broth and fingerling potatoes. The fish was perfectly cooked, very fresh and tender.

My wine selection, Montepulciano was exceptional and perfectly complemented the food.

I also had a Voltaire mixed drink which I highly recommend.

Before and afterwards, the Owner and head chef from Sicily were gracious enough to welcome me as a guest.

Solare also features a gorgeous outdoor patio and is full of art which really enhances the mood.

Verdict: Solare is well deserving of its #1 rating in San Diego magazine for Italian restaurants and is easily within the 100 best in the nation in my experience.

Kudos to the exceptional team there.</text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>wow was this place is a HUGE disappointment.  First we get there and it looks decent.  we go to the hostess stand and the guy says "do you have reservations?"  me, "No".  him, "well, we'll fit you in but you should make reservations in the future because we really busy on Saturday night." um.......i looked around and saw about 10 tables open plus all the seat on the patio, which is where we wanted to see anyways.  Strike one.....lie and make it seem like you are super busy especially when i look around and i see half the restaurant empty.  AND.....while, i'm sitting outside and i can see how many more people go in and it definitely wasn't enough to fill all your open tables. AND definitely don't lie to me and say that the tables in the front near the heat lamp is reserved when the couple after me asks if they can sit there and you let them.WTF?!

My next problem was the service.  we waiting 10 minutes to get water and our drinks ordered.  the food itself..........i've had better at olive garden.  We had the prosciutto and salami board to start..... um, 4 pieces of prosciutto and about 10 pieces of salami.......seriously?!  that was the biggest waste of $15 ever.  My wife had the Osso Bucco, which is pork by the way if you don't read carefully, it's not the traditional veal shank which was kinda tough and had no flavor at all on top of "risotto"....like about 2 tablespoons of risotto.  I had the linguine alla pecatora......meh......tasted like they opened up a can of Del Monte Stewed Tomatoes and just mixed.

We got the bill and paid......the freakin waiter took the bill while we were still sitting there........at least wait until we get out of our seats!!!!  i will never go here again........STAY AWAY........unless you like be overcharged and enjoy horrible service.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This is the best cafe in the neighborhood. It's our go to place when we don't feel like cooking. I was sad when Actual Cafe closed down but Paradise Cafe is an upgrade. The staff is always super friendly and helpful and the food is delicious. Our server Hannah went out of her way to make sure all of our needs were met. They also have a play corner for kids which means my husband and I actually get to eat our food without interruption! If you're in the neighborhood stop by Paradise cafe.</Review>

<review>I can’t tell you how much I appreciate this establishment’s investment in tater tots. Make sure you get some! I have yet to try their non-breakfast options, but they have a vegan breakfast burrito with chickpea tofu that’s like nothing I’ve ever tasted. Out of this world. Cold brew is delicious too.<//review></record>

<Text>I like their menu, but service is lacking. Ordered simple breakfast sandwich. No one else there. 15+ minutes to wait. Counter person asked me if I was waiting for an order. I said yes, but she didn't bother to check on it. A little while later, I asked about the order, she went in back, but when she came out, she didn't give me a status.

When order finally came out, no apology at all. I mentioned the long wait and that maybe she should communicate that to the kitchen. She said okay. Again no apology for the wait. Maybe it's a communication issue with kitchen. But at least attempt to learn what went wrong instead of shrugging your shoulders.< /Text><name>D B< /name><GmapID>0x80857e612d3a9645:0x50a9397cc272582a<//GmapID>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1621193668312, 'text': 'Hello D B We are so sorry to hear this. Long waits even when the cafe seems empty is because of orders that are placed through online delivery services and through our pick up service thru toast. We will talk to to our staff as this does not sound like the customer service our customers are used to. Thank you for letting us know and we hope that you will give us another try.'}< /resp>< Rating>

Organic wrap, juice, salads, desserts, pizza and burgers. This place has it all! I'm so happy that there are many vegan options and strictly organic juice.

The only thing that wasn't organic was the chips that came with my wrap but at least it was non-gmo.</text>

Simple and good ambience. It's definitely a good place for breakfast. Very friendly staff. This place is slightly crowded during peak times. I've just had french toast here which is pretty good.</text>

<Text>i really enjoy this place. Let me tell you why. I am an avid coffee fan and when I can get a good cup of coffee and some breakfast or lunch sign me up! Its a one stop shop if you ask me.

I had the fig, prosciutto, truffle, and arugula pizza. It had great flavors and textures! Salty and sweet, soft and crunchy. The crust/dough could have used some salt though.

My biggest complaint was the little bits of corn meal all over the bottom of the pizza was burnt. I did not like that taste, and I also believe burnt foods may not be good for health, either. Also, I'd like to see more warm vegetarian menu options here.

My partner said the meat in his turkey sandwich was very high quality and tasty. The portions were great, we ate everything again for dinner the next day, making the seemingly high initial price tag very worth it and a good value for the quality. I appreciate the mindfulness around organic produce/responsibly farmed meat.

I enjoyed the ambiance in the place, the music, and the counter service. There were only 3 other people there for dinner Sunday night before close, so I'm glad it wasn't crowded like some of the other reviews mention. I would recommend!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1gN-hzYylmdOA7ztPaARpXdaVogS1xSoRCUrL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

It's Ok I had the cheeseburger but there was so much aioli I couldn't taste the cheese , the burger was really greasy and blandly under seasoned however I ordered it medium and it was done just so. My favorite part was the onion crisps on top of the burger which also needed salt and the fries which were great! If I'm in the area again I might give them another try the pizza looked good.< /Review>

< Review>
I was sad when the "Actual Cafe" closed but Paradise Park is a worthy replacement. The food is great, I'm a fan of their salads especially. The staff is super friendly. They have endless patience with even the pickiest kid (mine for example). Free wifi and plenty of power outlets make it a good place to work. But it's also a great place to bring the kids for a quick lunch.
One of my favorite spots in the neighborhood!< /Review>

Food was delish! Service was excellent! They have outside seating, which is a welcomed respite from the now too common carry-out only-option that most restaurants have.<//review>

Good business boils down to people and product. The barrista was perfect (flawless mochas) just the right amount of convo, proof less is more. Remarkably quick, the brew was a perfect combination of temperature, taste, and finish. Doppio perfetto!<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Wow, this place is amazing for breakfast. Lots of varied options for every taste. I had the Paradise Egg Sandwich, and it might have been the best egg sandwich I've had in... I don't know how long because I don't recall having a better one.

Someone else reviewed their tots, which I think was in reference to one of their menu items that included tots - because their regular tots as an add-on to other meals are great, but basically exactly what you'd hope tater tots would be - crispy fried potatoes in tot form. Delicious, but not something I'd seek out when they have SO MANY amazing options to choose from. I can't say I was disappointed though.

Also got a cafe mocha, which is not really my norm; usually they're too sweet, but on the recommendation from the staff I tried it, and she was absolutely right - not too sweet, more of a dark chocolate, just right by me.

Everyone working at the place was really friendly and chatty but not invasive. I definitely have a new favorite breakfast spot in Oakland!< /text>< Pictures>

I think this is a hidden gem for brunch among all the overrated brunch places in the Berkeley area. Food quality is high (have had eggs, french toast) at a great price. Fresh squeezed orange juice actually tastes like it is 100% fresh squeezed and not cut with concentrated OJ like other places.
Their home made jam is a nice touch and some times I will order a side of toast just to have the jam.  :)

Workers seemed to take pride in the food quality. It can be a little busy/cramped at times, but not as ridiculous as some other places that serve mediocre brunch.<//Text>

Tasty smoothies with rich flavor. Especially the green machine was delicious. Unfortunately, the same thing can't be said about their pizzas which was sloppy, wet and the bread undercooked, and mostly reminded us of the pre-baked pizza crust you can get at Walmart. The Buddha Bowl was also a disappointment. The cafe itself looks really nice tho. Maybe a bad day in the kitchen?< /review>

I ordered an herb scramble with goat cheese.  The eggs were tasty enough, sort of standard diner style.   The servers are nice and do a good job. However, I think the food is pricey for what you get.  I believe it was around $13 or more for the scramble with toast and tater tots.  I didn't try any of the drinks.</Text>

<text>I adore this place. What’s not to love? The charming interior makes you feel right at home from the first steps past the window display. Entering, fragrant deliciousness intoxicates you: coffee, teas, juices and drool-worthy food. Counter service makes it fast and easy to pop in and get your experience underway. I’m not one to review restaurants; however, I’ve been back home for over an hour and I’m still blissfully reminiscing about my lunch and dreaming of my next trip. Their fried chicken sandwich is perfectly crispy and topped with some of the best pickled onions I’ve ever had the pleasure of eating. The ideal ratio of vinegar to spices, not too sweet and perfectly sour. The flavor combo with their buttery bun and fry batter is indescribable, seriously. The house made chips are crispy to perfection and delightfully salty. Wash it all down with some of their house made lemonade to really top it off! All that to say...go! It tops my list of spots to grab a bite in the east bay!</text><user>113732735336863116838< /user></record>

<Text>I'm new to the area and have came to this place a few times with my new coworkers. I think it's a gem and get the impression it's valued by the neighborhood. So far, I've had the breakfast burrito and the curry chicken salad. Both were carefully prepared, nourishing, and delicious. The ingredients seem of high quality. The staff and space are cool, and attract all sorts of cool people.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Great service. Very nice staff. The breakfast menu has a lot of options. The ham and cheese croissant was really good. Ample seating with a couple booths, tables, community long tables, and a bar area for the laptops. Do recommend for families as there’s an area carved out for kids to play with some toys. If you’re not into kids or a loud environment, probably not the best on a Sunday morning. Don’t know about other times but this place is definitely popular.<//Text>< Pics>

I really want to like this place because it is so convenient for me, but I have to say is really gone down hill since it changed from Actual Cafe.
Cashier staff don't seem very happy to serve you and are not super helpful with questions if you have them. The last couple times I was there I ordered a drink and after far to long waiting I realize they had just forgotten to make it... 2 times in a row!

I also HATE 'to go' cups when I place my order 'for here'. I know they have glass cups to serve beverages in but they don't seem to want to use them. Last time I asked why they didn't deserve me a 'for here' glad the response I got was, "I think they are all dirty".  ... Ummm... Wash them???!!!

This place has such great potential... Maybe just needs new management... Again???

I adore this place, come in often for lunch and to work. The sweetest staff ever and the food is definitely a cut above most local cafes. The signature Paradise salad is my go-to at least once a week. Nice beer and wine offerings. Only gripe: the music can be really grating.< /review>

<Date>1550689739821<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>It's become comically hilarious how awful this place is. I live in the neighborhood and have tried- repeatedly- to get something done correctly there. They have botched bagel orders, brought me the wrong food, dragged on pouring ice coffee (how does a plate of eggs arrive before a cup of coffee)? What's worse? THE SERVICE. NO ONE seems to want to be there. They don't greet you, they don't smile, they don't seem to have established roles. I've seen people behind the bar pick their nose, touch their hair, wear their hair down (as it should be worn up for health standards).

Even if they manage to get the food right--- guess what? It's not very good.

Anyone that sings the praises of this place obviously hasn't been to a competent cafe before.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I was not able to login to their wifi. They have wifi, but I had issues connecting with either my phone or laptop hence the star reduction.< /review>

This is a wonderful place to grab a tasty bite for breakfast or lunch.  They always have a pot brewed for a quick coffee and they know how to make espresso drinks the right way. The decor is clean and comfortable and the staff is friendly. They have a nice counter to wait at when ordering food to go. I enjoy reading and writing while here.</Text>

<Review>I feel bad giving this place 3 stars because the food is actually really good, but it seems like every time I try to go there for lunch I can't find a seat and 95% of the space is occupied by people on their laptops with just a coffee, and this is on weekends! The cafe should limit wifi time (mainly on weekends) so other guests can have a spot to eat. I've seen numerous places that do this, and prioritize guests with food orders. Anyways, I don't know if I will come back since this happens every single time. But delicious food and nice quality coffee drinks, nonetheless.</Review></record>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Great place for a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast.  About 60% of the time the cashiers have condescending attitudes when asking simple questions regarding the menu, or asking for ice water.  I don't work there, how am I supposed to know ice water is self serve, or where it's located???  That's why i'm docking a few stars.

Next time I'll bring some clear acrylic rimmed glasses and speak with an affect to possibly receive a higher level of service.

If you're unhappy with your cashier job, step your game up and get a better job... Don't take it out on the customers!

Otherwise, it's got decent food and good coffee.  Great tater tots!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80857e612d3a9645:0x50a9397cc272582a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love hanging out and eating here but the prices are steep and the sun comes in through the front at the time of day I usually visit and can get very warm. Friendly staff, tasty food and coffee, high prices because of organic + locally sourced.<//Text>

Nice spot for a meal, a meeting, time w/ young kids, or work. The food is good (but not cheap), and the atmosphere is great. Has beer on tap. (If you are familiar with the Dolores Park and Duboce Park cafes in SF, this is in the same family.)<//Review>

Was very excited to try this place as I’m a big fan of their other cafes in San Francisco (Precita, Duboce, etc) but was disappointed in the food. We ordered the avocado toast as a mid morning snack and it’s a single piece of thinly sliced bread with about 1/4 of an avocado on it. There’s probably an unspoken expectation of this dish that if you’re going to pay $10 or more dollars it’s a decadent cut of bread, a generous serving of avocado, etc. This was comically small and unfilling for its price. Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing.<//text>

{'time': 1560142461455, 'text': 'Kristiane, I am so sorry that you had this experience as it does not sound like the avocado toast we usually serve. We will reach out to our  management team and crew as we realize mistakes are made. Please come back as our guest and ask for Dana. We hope that will give us another try and the opportunity to fix the order. Thank you'}< /Response>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>This place was better when it was Actual Cafe, which had a more pleasant, homey atmosphere. My first time here since the change because the facelift just didn't feel welcoming like the Actual Cafe look. The bookshelf is gone, as is the bike rack, flyer shelf, and cool push bike hanging in the window. Overall these changes give it less character and make it feel like any old coffee shop designed to move as many customers thru as possible. The cashier wasn't polite and sniffed when I asked if she had a couple spare pennies so I could get 2 dimes in change instead of 18 cents (because pennies are worthless and I don't use them) which I threw into the tip jar anyway. At any rate I'll walk a few blocks farther down San Pablo to Pepples Donut Farm next time.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80857e612d3a9645:0x50a9397cc272582a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Was surprised to find Paradise Park Cafe open today as I walked around the neighborhood. The cafe took over the Actual Cafe location around January 2017. Took a while to open. Today was their official grand opening.

I had an almond milk mocha with an almond croissant, $9.19 total including a $1 tip. I guess that is what a coffee drink and pastry costs now. They do NOT have a senior citizen discount and no opening specials. The drink and pastry were okay, the mocha was as I asked for, not sweet, but lacked a strong chocolate flavor. The almond croissant had little flavor.

Even though they had around 10 people on their staff, the opening day showed that there was a lot of management and training to do. Some things I noticed:

- No dish pan available, unclear where dirty dishes go

- The instructions from the counter person about how to get on the wifi were incorrect, there was no hub called ParadiseParkCafe. The password I was given did not work for the two hubs, Paradise1 and Paradise2.

_____ Some good stuff

+ toilets clean and functional.

+ staff friendly and courteous.

+ lots of seating with indoor and outdoor options,  individual tales that could be pushed together for a group.

+ large number of food choices and drinks on menu -- mostly "healthy"

- There was no bulletin board for a cafe that advertises as a community organization. Also, most of the patrons were visually and hearing plugged into their electronics -- again not much community.

- Unclear where to wait for coffee drink or food ordered.<//text>< date>

We get slammed at lunch pretty quickly on top of having to fulfill to go orders/delivery orders at one time. Our kitchen can indeed get backed up. We do apologize for cold coffee as we make fresh coffee every half hour. In the future please let our counter people know and they will gladly replace it or make a coffee drink to your liking. We are currently in the process of creating a quicker system to get food out more promptly.

<Review>decent coffee, but for that high price, I expect at least the normal volume for a medium coffee (got a small cup). and the barista kept saying how she was "like so out of it today",  not inspiring for my first human interaction of the day?   =  2.5 stars</Review>< pics>

Every time I order large coffee they give me a small. It's really frustrating because I don't want to have to spend the extra time to get back in line, and waste an extra to go cup for the amount of coffee I paid for in the first place.<//review>

We always appreciate feedback as we know there is room to improve. Regarding seating we have tons of 4 tops and booths . It seems you wrote this review on a weekend. Our weekends are very busy hence it being hard to find a table during peak hours and ticket times getting slowed down.

Food is good, decor is great, service is friendly and well meaning but often slow and prone to errors. Seating seems to be either for two people or for eight people, very few 4-person seats.< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>We were introduced to this place by a colleague from work. He raved about their food and so I brought my office staff for a treat. We all loved the food! But when we had the chance to discuss our experience in terms of service, we all agreed that the Mother, Pina (the main cook) and her daughter, the server did not treat us well. They were friendly to other customers who were white but noticeably different with us. Because of their good food, our first not pleasant experience did not stop us from coming back. On our next visit my children who are Italian food lovers joined me and my office crew. It was again pretty obvious that while the daughter and server was very chatty with other white customers, she was hardly talking to us and forgetting our orders and needed to be followed up. We did try to be friendly guests but for some reason, we as a group, were not appealing to them. When kitchen is not so busy, Pina would get out and talk to customers but not to us. Not taking offense to our experiences, we patronized them 2 more times by ordering party trays but even these were not a good experience. We stopped patronizing Pina's since then. There are other well deserving restaurants out there.I don't want to name our bad experiences but you can read between the lines and determine for yourself.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dcdbd88531d517:0xa1180c86eb09d085< /gmap_id><date>1584529393901<//date><rate>1< /rate><Name>Cheri Platte< /Name></record>

After reading all the reviews we were expecting something really great.  Nothing special, not spectacular. Pretty mediocre Italian food. Staff was very nice. Probably wouldn't recommend. If someone doesn't know great Italian, they probably won't know the difference. No offense to the owner, they're trying their best, but it's just so, so.< /text>

Probably the best Italian food you'll get outside of Italy. Pina and her crew are the friendliest folks around and truly care about their craft. 3rd time here and it couldn't have been better.</Review>

<Review>I love Pina's Bistro Restaurant from the very first time I saw it (it was closed) when I stopped next door for other business. 2 months ago, I actually visited it for the very first time! I had The best creamy and delicious pasta and I met Pina!!! This evening, I found out that her recipe for the Alfredo doesn't include the strong chemicals other Alfredo sauces have since she prepares it in a natural and in the most natural way. I saw she has her tomato sauces and salad dressing in bottles to be bought in case you want to take them to your home! She is adorable, professional, and a very good chef!  As the saying says: "Barriga llena, corazón contento".  We love Pina!!!

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>This is a small family owned restaurant with a focus on high quality ingredients and preparation.
They make their own sausage to add to their pastas.
I had the spicy penne with pork sausage and I really appreciated that it wasn't overly salty.
It was mixed with sliced red bell peppers and a quality olive oil and their house made sausage.
The side salad that came with the meal had a house made dressing that was delicious.
All in all it was a very good experience.<//Review>< user>

Small storefront b!istro with outdoor seating.  Home style Italian faire prepared individually to order by Pina and served by her daughters. An assortment of daily specials are  offered and an excellent choice of Italian wines are available.  Homemade lemoncello is an added bonus.  A bit pricey but well deserved.</text>

<text>I've been here a couple times and the food is really amazing.  Everything is very noticeably fresh and the flavors of the sauces are amazing.  It's pretty pricey for Italian food but it is so worth it.  I came here with a couple friends and we're always amazed by our meals.  We then try each others' food and are amazed.  Pina makes her own sausages (delicious!) and makes her own sauces every day.  She even carries a few Italian beers that are surprisingly good. It can get busy in the evenings so you may want to call ahead and make reservations.<//text>< Pics>

They have so much of paneer, which you will never imagine that a restaurant in downtown would add so much to fill your hearts content.

This is  a great spot for lunch. I can no longer eat the food there because i'm gluten free.  But before they have the best bread and the pasta is always great.< /Text>

<userid>108287380108185503152< /userid><review>If I could give Pina's 10 stars I would!  We drove 3 hours to go to Pina's because the name caught my attention , we share the same name and I was intrigued.  After reading the reviews I knew I had to try it. This is an authentic Italian family run Restaurant.   Pina makes everything from scratch just like I would at home. The whole meal was scrumptious, from the fresh home made bread I was hooked. We had calamari,  salad, lasagna and her special home made sausage alla pizzaiola.  Finished with the best homemade tiramisu,  cannoli and espresso. Needless to say this was the best dining experience.  Pina and her daughter Rachel were so attentive , friendly and a pleasure to interact with and made us feel like part of the family. Definitely worth the drive. She even sent me home with some of her homemade bread. The only downside is that I won't be able to come back as often as I  would like because I  live so far,  but I will definitely make a point of coming back whenever I can.< /review></record>

Intimate seating, family owned and run, Pina even cane to sit with us for a while and told us a bit about her family history. We went there for my birthday and received a scrumptious mascarpone filled cannoli. We're planning on going back soon! FYI, just call before visiting to make sure you get a table.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Over the past 10 years whether Pina or her daughters were chefing the dining experience has always a pleasure. Visit once and Pina's Bistro immediately will top your list of favorite places to dine. Pina bakes her own bread each day before the sun wakes up, hunts down the freshest veggies, and goes all out every day for her dining clientele. Her filet mignon would do my home state of Texas proud. All Pina's Specials are just that. Special. One word to avoid being disappointed. Make reservations. (Okay so it was two words).<//review>

I came in knowing what direction I was wanting to purchase. But after the associate did an evaluation on me, we ended up purchasing a different product that I’m really happy with. I’m sad I didn’t catch the persons name because he really was wonderful, helpful and pleasant. Thanks to you, my feet will be happy again.<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is the best for running shoes! Our expert, David, was clearly knowledgeable about which shoes would be best for different needs and made specific recommendations for both me and my mom. He was so patient, doing a custom fit size/shape and gait assessment for both of us. I love my new Hoka shoes!< /text>

First went here over 20 years ago (!) and was fitted for some nice shoes. Since then have mostly done online buying, but recently decided I needed to get serious again. They have the latest technology and can determine the most appropriate shoes. They brought out several pairs and I found the best shoes for me. Their prices are standard retail--same as online--and totally worthwhile. It's a bargain to have such service and selection.</text>

Great experience.
They checked my steps to see what kind of shoe would be best for me, and found the perfect shoes. Jenny, the sales associate who helped me was a delight to work with. Very knowledgeable and patient.</Text>

<Review>Came into the store to check out their 5 Step Fit Process and maybe look into getting some insoles since I have plantar fasciitis. Breac listened and walked me through the process. He concluded that I'm a heavy heal striker so he brought out some shoes that may help with the situation. Usually I'm all about the looks of the shoes or the brand, but as I'm getting older comfort is what I'm looking for since I have to stand all day for work. The 3 pairs of shoes he brought out were super light, comfortable and puts ultra boosts to shame in terms of comfort. I mainly just wanted insoles but I walked out with a pair of Bondi shoes as well. Thanks Breac for the awesome customer service!<//Review><Response>{'time': 1621977754611, 'text': 'Fantastic. Enjoy the shoes and good luck with your PF!'}<//Response>< rating>

<Review>I went into Snail's Pace for the first time. We got a friendly greeting and we're immediately assisted by Reed. He scanned my feet and went to the back to choose some shoes. I had already done some research and he came out with the ones that I already wanted to try on. He had very good intuition and asked the right questions. He also seems very knowledgeable about the shoes. Our experience there was a perfect one. I would easily recommend going do a snail's pace for shoes. Read was the best!< /Review></record>

<user>102269440327558113732<//user><text>One of the best experiences I have had in my life! Guy helped me out so much here. He made the whole process super smoove. He was really insightful and you could tell he has a ton of running experience. He got my feet scanned, analyzed, and fitted into different pairs of shoes. He was super helpful and I ended up buying a pair of shoes and some running socks. A life changing moment for me because I have been wearing the wrong size shoes my whole life! Thank you again Guy!

Sincerely,
A very happy customer.< /text><Time>1601088026715</Time></record>

This is a great shop! They fitted me with the perfect shoes and educated me along the way. They also did a great job keeping customers separated and safe with their COVID-19 procedures. I’ll definitely go back.<//Text>

Today I went for the first time on the recommendation of a gym partner, since the doctor recommended me some insoles or shoes for my horrible pain in my feet.  I arrived early, and all the staff were already busy.  I waited for approximately 35 min, but it is the first time I have been waiting with pleasure, since they have an armchair that gives massages and that was excellent.  There they have the technology to see how to step on and see the individual needs of each client.  The lady who attended to me was very attentive and I listen to my concerns and needs, leave very happy with the recommendations, and of course I will return.  Thank you! :) for the nice experience and keep working the same.</Review>

This store has top-notch customer support.

Bri helped me pick out new shoes for running long distance. From the moment I walked in until I left with my new shoes, the service was outstanding. She definitely made my experience at the store worthy of stopping. We spent almost an hour picking the right shoes for me.

The prices of the shoes will vary depending on the needs of the person. I need shoes with more cushioning, so I had to spend a little more than what I am used to. Regardless of the prices, I appreciated that Bri kept in mind my budget and offered to show me shoes on the lower price side.

If I have to recommend a store for someone looking for running advice, this will be my go to.< /Review>

<Text>Incredible shoe buying experience - my wife was looking to buy her first pair of real running shoes but didn't know where to start. We went to ASP and she was immediately welcomed in to the shop and was assigned a shoe specialist. Her stance was analyzed, her gait was checked, and the staff really took the time to listen to what she wanted and what she was planning to do with the shoe.
I think my wife tried on every 8-1/2 size shoe in the store by the time we were done - she had no idea what she was looking for and was unsure about how the shoes should feel, and the staff were more than accommodating. Yea, it was a little pricey and we could've bought the shoes cheaper online, but we were more than happy to pay for the incredible service, knowledge and attention.</Text>< Pictures>

Excellent customer service, videotaped me running on a treadmill, observed my stride running in the parking lot, and used a machine to measure food arch.

Proceeded to bring out 5 styles that would fit my running style. I was able to try on each shoe and run outside... really refreshing to visit a store where they car about the person.

I forget her name, but ask for the retired teacher. She was very knowledgeable and helpful.

The only slightly negative, sock selection. Didn't have mediums in the style I liked...

Highly recommended!</Review>

I have, arguably, the pickiest feet on the planet and Greg was able to help me find a pair of running shoes in less than 30 minutes.

<review>I'll keep this short. My wife and daughter went to this store ready to buy shoes for my daughter.  Store staff asked them to take a seat and they'd be right with them.  20 minutes later, other people entered the store, were directly helped, and my wife and daughter were told to take a number.  Can't tell you whether they have good shoes or not, but the customer service is a 1 star because they don't have a zero star.<//review><Rate>1< /Rate>< name>

First, their service and time to find the right shoes was nearly overwhelming. Lots of test runs on their sidewalks to ensure a perfect fit. Then I find out they have a 100% guarantee for return for the few weeks after you buy them so nothing can go wrong. Then I checked their prices against online prices and found them to be very competitive. I've shopped here for the last 2-3 years and it's always been a wonderful experience.<//Text>< user>

Have purchased shoes from this shop for over 10 years.
My son went in recently to have a fitting and thought he would purchase shoes online.
The sales person spent over 30 minutes testing on machines & trying on shoes to find the best ones for my son. My son was thoroughly impressed and purchased shoes from shop. He said he has never had anyone so knowledgeable work with him and take so much time to find just the right shoes.</review>

<Review>These guys are great, and while it's true if you're a bargain shopper you might be able to find some of their products for less elsewhere, their service is truly outstanding. They will look to see how you run and analyze your running style to get the right shoe, they have running academies to take you from regular running to running marathon's and on top of that their employees have always been friendly. They've really sold me as a customer.< /Review>< Pictures>

First off, let me say that I am NOT a runner.  However, my sister and my grown nephews are all avid runners.  I have purchased shoes at A Snail's Pace for my own daughters when they did cross country in school, and those experiences were great.  But the reason I am posting this review now is that, being pressed for time to get my Christmas shopping done, and being a full-time worker and a full-time student at the same time, going to malls and stores for holiday shopping is just not a possibility for me right now.

Today I called the store, and spoke with Melissa, the manager on duty.  She was able to look up the history of one of my nephews and help me pick out a present for him based upon my nephew's past purchases, including sizes and brand names.  She was so gracious in her customer service, I wish she had a manager whom I could call and give the compliment.  She helped me choose an item, took my credit card information over the phone, and is shipping the item to my house directly (shipping is no charge, by the way).  I fully recommend A Snail's Pace for all your running needs.< /review>

Ask for a guy named Eddie. He's one cool surfer/runner dude that knows what he's talking about! Two thumbs up and a Shaka for this shop and crew.<//Text>

They actually take into account your style of running. They don't use the machine they just have knowledgeable runners for staff. Not salespeople like other chain stores. 5 out of 5 for having your best interest in mind.<//Text>

Great selection of shoes and friendly staff with the exception of their manager or possible owner.
Don't ask for a discount, even if you purchase several pairs of shoes. You might get a snide remark.< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><rating>5</rating><text>Went in today to do some shoe research and check if I should get new shoes, see how different ones felt, etc. Bob greeted me and helped me try out about 4 pairs of shoes before I settled on a pair. He was super nice and really helpful, even though I was unable to purchase anything today. Prices are unfortunately pretty close to MSRP, but if you have the money, then definitely go there for a friendly and experienced hand to guide you with your athletic needs=)< /text><time>1338601372666</time>< user_name>

Arianna was absolutely amazing, really helped me out in a pinch. I always come to snail's pace when I have shoe needs - have bought 4-5 pairs over the years from them and always the best of service and the best of brands.<//text>

The fun and exciting staff make the experience very interactive and promote safety first! Being in the cozy rooms upstairs promotes intimacy in a public setting, and I even found a cute couple to invite over to my hotel room!  Better club than others in San Fran, and will be returning again.</review>

What a fun time, at first we were a little disappointed with the crowd but decided to hang out longer, we're so glad we did. Everyone was super respectful and made it a 100% enjoyable experience for a couple first timers! The PE gave us a good show and we definitely gave one back!< /text>

<Review>First time there this weekend. Had a very cool
experience. Only downfall is I  was being followed by the same guys for the rest of night. Everytime I sat down boom there they were. Gonna try a couples night and see if the vibe is any different.  Also some sexy music playing would be nice..</Review>< Rate>

<text>The staff is great and super on top of consent issues. I always feel safe here, but it is a better experience if you come with a partner. I've been three times now with my boyfriend, and for the most part people were really respectful, not interrupting scenes or touching without consent.</text>< pictures>

<text>My only criticism would be that the music is not conducive to our goals. We had a hard time getting in the mood because the music was too pop (upstairs) or too metal (the dungeon), nothing sensual about it. The music is a big part of the atmospere, so I would suggest taking a look at your playlist. Other than that, we've only got good things to say. Most were respectful of boundaries, and the staff handle complaints efficiently, and keep us feeling safe.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80858085517790d1:0x733ffbe89f80abf3<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Just to be clear, you can sorry, but the cleanliness doesn’t depends about the time, and no I won’t go back. Not even if you are going to pay for me.
Besides this try to figure out some new answer because I saw the same a couple of times.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>This place has been open for some time, it's an institution in Frisco, old location on Otis st was the best, they had a basement/ dungeon and rooms, it was like a saw movie set, it gave you the really creepy vibe but was exciting, main room was open place and poles, upper room was always couples and that's where most action happened, new location in Jones St. Is really small, couples place is where the action is but is only for couples except for 1 or 2 days a month where is open to singles, other areas are filled with trannys, and mostly guys, all types: Latinos, white, black, elderly, most times all are very kind and obey the rules, clientele has gone down considerably. Better get used to this location as they will not move anywhere else.< /review>< Pics>

One note for couples going for your first time.... Lots of single guys just eyeballing any woman around and they will follow you around hoping that you will invite them in on your action. If a couple is getting their bang on some guys will come rt up and stare and even try to put their face within inches of mans shaft going in woman's body looking for every detail! Other than that it's a great time and if theirs other couples doing there thing close by and they are attractive like my woman and I that opens up much grander possibilities for even more fun! Just be safe and aware and keep your woman feeling safe with you and you will enjoy!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Best damn club I've ever been too. At first I was nervous but I totally let go and grew a new positive relationship with myself. Theres no judgement on your body type or orientation. It's fantastic. Definitely coming back soon! Also thank you Rich for being so kind and escorting me and my friend back to our car. Greatly appreciated!<//text>

< Review>
First off, this is a sex club.
Don't expect to go here and get a drink and dance.  It's not that kind of place.
Second, this club is what you are willing to make of it.
If you bring a partner and go have fun, you will really enjoy the play-space.
There is everything from open room beds, stipper polls, semi-private rooms, video rooms, even a small dungeon!
Think of it as a strip club/sex club but without the provided strippers.

It's an adult's playground.

The best nights to come are Fridays and the 3rd Saturday of every month.
Every Friday is couples night, and there is always a LOT of action going on and around the club.
The 3rd Saturday is "Ball night" and it's always packed and a lot of fun.

If you are a single guy and coming to have fun or hoping to get lucky, I HIGHLY recommend coming on a Friday night.  A good portion of the couples that come to play are looking for a fun guy to add to their sexual fun.
Come well dressed, be polite and you'll have a great time.</Review>

I have been to the Power Exchange Multiple times including the previous locations the staff at the door is now starting to be so rude compared to former staff and than ladies used to be free than it was ten and now it is twenty the last time I went I didn’t even go in because the staff was beyond rude why take a Job and not even want to be there</text>
<resp>{'time': 1532224965520, 'text': 'Power Exchange is only $20 for Single in Female Attire on special event nights. Sunday through Thursday the price is $5, and $10 for non-event Friday’s and Saturday’s.\n\nTo be frank, there’s not much else you can do in San Francisco for the price of PE entry.

This place is a joke, congested, narrow walkways, not enough room for anything. The clientele are mostly trolls and elderly. I think it's all about the location. The power exchange rocked at it's old location in San Francisco on Otis street. I wish they get that place re- opened or similar to it. Jones street power exchange totally sucks, don't waste your money and time.< /review>

The shotist place I've even been to, they take your money just to go in there and listen to their bullshit music, smoky nasty room/ hall. No female just a couple of dudes hanging there. Never ever go there and this was my first and last time. I don't recommend it to anybody they just take your money. The guards at the door are lying they will tell it's packed when you go tbere there is nobody.<//text>

We would like to mention that in the 22 years Power Exchange has been open to the community of the SF Bay Area, there has never been a situation that went too far. You may not see the monitors walking around the club, because many of them wear casual clothes and blend in, but they are there, watching. You are ALWAYS safe at the Power Exchange.

<text>Not the best. Had an appointment and still waited 20mins. The lady who did my pedicure didn’t cut any of my cuticles off I had to ask her to shape my nails. She finished the pedicure in less than 15 mins. My manicure was decent only reason why they get 3 stars. With covid they aren’t following social distancing when getting a manicure.< /text><name>Mayra T< /name><GmapID>0x80dc0c9ff7b0e03d:0x9e5695e8a060e15b</GmapID><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>3</Rate>< date>

<text>I got my nails done here and the nail technician was rushing through doing my nail polish and it didn’t look smooth as there was filing dust all over. She didn’t even clean my hands after, just applied cuticle oil on top of filing dust. If am paying $50 for a full set I expect better services. Not impressed<//text>< username>

This is a wonderful nail salon and I was welcomed and made comfortable from the time I called to the time I walked in. I had m nails acrylic filled and gel painted by Christina who was professional and accurate, they came out beautiful. Then Katie did my pedicure and it was relaxing and a beautiful experience. They are super clean and wear gloves for each client. The price is right as well! I will be back )
Thank you from a satisfied lady.<//text>

I selected Nails 2000 based on those reviews and was very disappointed.  I went for the $32 mani/pedi which is little more than a polish change.  As you can see by my manicure (after only 1 day), the top coat didn't reach the edges of the nails.  She didn't even smooth out the nails after lightly filing them.

Michelle is my favorite! She is thorough, meticulous, pays attention to detail, and is efficient.
I love the variety of colors they offer in regular, dip powder, and gel.
Pro tip- go early on Tuesday or Wednesday morning to avoid the after work/school crowds.
Even better- Make.An. Appointment.</review>

Ken is absolutely amazing!! He is a perfectionist just like me so he made sure that every detail was up to par and I’m extremely happy with the outcome.  I’ll never go anywhere else, or to any other nail artist, he’s the best and they are all very nice there.  😃🤩</Text>

I am amazed at how long my regular manicure has lasted. It's been 9 days and they still haven't chipped!! I was at the La Costa resort and the spa was booked so I went over to Nails 2000. I was set up with Anne (pedicure) and Renee (manicure) - think that was their names. "Renee" is the only one that speaks Chinese there.

Both were meticulous and Anne gave an amazing massage. I wish you guys were in Vancouver because I would send all my friends to you two. Thanks for the great experience! And forgo the La Costa spa; save your money and come here. It's a better service for at least half price.</Text>

Wonderful salon. Everyone so nice. I usually call one day in advance and they can always accomodate my schedule. They welcome walk-ins too. The salon is very clean and all pedicure bowls are lined with a new plastic liner for each client. Yay! No sharing germs there!  There is also an extensive polish color selection for all services.  Parking is a breeze and salon is conveniently located by Starbucks, restaurants, a bank and a grocery store. Prices are reasonable and competitive.

Try it. You will be glad you did!<//review>

Very professional & friendly. If you want nails with a perfect shape that last, call & make an appointment to see Mandy!

You might get lucky with a walk-in, but usually she's pretty booked up. Legit skills, you won't be sorry if she does your acrylic.< /review>

<Review>My new favorite shop! I switched from the shop at el Camino and Encinitas due to rushed service.  This staff is so meticulous and applies 3 coats of gel color plus a clear coat without me even having to ask. very affordable too! great color selections in gel and regular. and good attention to extra skin on the cuticles. I saw the 1 star below and there is no way that reviewer walked out of the shop like that. that's a 2 week old manicure....< /Review>< user>

They made me wait almost 20 minutes I asked how long it would take because I had to go and they said 5. I basically sat here in water waiting and got up to leave.</text>

<Text>I have never been so disrespected by a place of business in my life. The owner is super super super rude. I was told when I got there that I would be given a pedicure about half way thru my fill. New people kept walking in without apts and getting a pedicure before me. I told my manicurist that that was bad business. He offered to do the pedicure after my fill. I said no thanks because I was upset about being passed over. A couple minutes later I changed my mind because I really needed the service. The salon was super packed so the owner blamed me to another customer and told her that I had changed my mind and the lady would have to wait another half hour. Of course that customer was upset so I told  the owner that I didn't change my mind. She bumped me. She told me everyone else had an appt so I needed to wait. Such lies! I felt bad for the other customer so I told the owner that I had changed my mind again then, lol. Good luck to you if you decide to risk it. Decent prices but they overbook themselves and then blame you!!!!!!!!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc0c9ff7b0e03d:0x9e5695e8a060e15b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was very disappointed with the service and my main dish at this restaurant.  Wgat I did like was the tofu I ordered and the pineapple mango tea.  What I did not like was that I ordered pan fried noodles with vegetables (they don't have a good vegetarian option) and the noodles very soft on the bottom of the plate and hard on top.  So I guess the noodles were chow mean (soft) on the top, and hard pretty much the top half of the plate.  It dud not really taste very good.  The service was lacking.  The server did not check on me once during my meal.  I won't go back especially because they don't have much vegetarian dishes to offer (they should offer tofu as you can have with your main dish).< /Text>

They are on the five stars app. I came to redeem a free tea, which the app did not mention had any stipulations. I placed the order, and the lady seemed surprised  that I was not ordering anything else. I’m totally fine with percent off coupons for a free item with another purchase, but the coupon had no other stipulations and she simply made up those rules. I ended up walking out of the restaurant.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Text>As of September, 2020, the restaurant offers 10% off for online orders with a coupon code (sale10) at gochanoicorner.com and if you order either online (on their website) or on the phone for any order over $15, you will get 1 free Red Tea Hibiscus drink. Free shipping for PostMates orders with a coupon code (I7TNGT).

I Find This The Best Northern Vietnamese Style Cuisine Restaurant in Southern California. Here Are The Main Dishes You Should Try At the Restaurant When Coming to Little Saigon because These Dishes Are Unique and Not Ubiquitous:

- Bún Riêu Cua Lột aka crab, eggs, tomato, fried tofu inside a vermicelli noodles soup bowl.

- Bún Chả Hà Nội aka fried ground pork roll with vermicelli noodles and assorted veggies. This is not a noodles soup, and you eat it like eating fried chicken and nuggets with vermicelli noodles and fish sauce mixed together.

- Bún Đậu Mắm Tôm aka rectangular vermicelli noodles assorted with fried tofu, pork, and chả cốm (green rice fried pork nuggets). This is not a noodles soup, and you eat it with shrimp sauce (mắm tôm).

- Bún Cá Rau Thì Là aka Vermicelli noodles soup with fish filet, dill, and water celery

- Bún Mộc and Bún Thang (Different Versions of Vermicelli Noodles Soup with Different Methods of Cooking Pork).

- Lẩu Hải Sản hoặc Lẩu Thập Cẩm aka Seafood or Combo Hot Pot

- Bún Thái Tom Yum aka Tom Yum Noodles Soup. This is not Vietnamese. We borow the noodles soup from the Thai/Dai ethnic in Yunnan and Sichuan province, present day China.

- Chem Chép Nướng Mỡ Hành, Ốc Hương Nướng Bơ Tỏi, và Nghêu Hấp Thái Xả Quế aka Grilled Mussels, Grilled Escargot, and Steamed Clams Soup, respectively.

Bonus: My Favorite Drinks That I Can’t Find Anywhere Else Are Corn Milk (Sữa Bắp) and Lemon Hibiscus Red Tea (Nước Trà Chanh Dây Nhuỵ Hoa Dâm Bụt).</Text>< Pics>

the Menu of this place is the best for Northern Vietnamese dishes, however, I just regret that the broth soup is very bad, just like water, this ruined everything which the restaurant trying to do! I hope the restaurant takes my comment as a constructive comment and improves.<//review>

I was offered a free Seasalt Cream Jasmine Tea in exchange for this review, and call me a sell-out, but I'll play along happily! In seriousness, the food here is so fresh and vibrant-looking, and it as inexpensive as any Vietnamese food place has any right to be. Decor and atmosphere are quirky and contemporary, and the place feels quite clean and modern. Nice to try a Vietnamese Restaurant with a northern twist. Popular and recommended to give it a try!<//review>

Great place to eat the authentic Bun Cha Ca Hanoi or any popular dishes from Hanoi Vietnam.This was the second time we came back to this restaurant. Their foods and services were very good, friendly and fast. We ordered Bun ca thang long, baby clams with rice paper, shrimps goi cuon and bun ca Hanoi. their foods indeed were authentic with smells of dills. I was not a fan of dills before after I ate it at this restaurant last time. I am now in love with it. Overall, I really liked the foods here maybe will try out different dishes next time we come. This place was very cleaned and the Restrooms were also remodeled...<//text>

<response>None<//response><text>One of my favorite resto to enjoy Hanoi food. I ordered Soft-shell carb noodle ( Bun rieu) + Baby clam with crispy rice cracker. However, I really think they need to improve their customer service. If you share and like their promotion post on FB, you get a FREE brulee cake cream milk tea. I shared and ordered the drink but they forgot. When I almost finished the food, I reminded the waitress again and waited. However, after I finished my food and waited for 5 minutes, I didn’t see my drink so I came to cashier to pay and asked the third time. He immediately made my drink in less than 3 minutes.</text><Rate>3<//Rate>< user_name>

<text>Very good food at cheaper price than most places. The service can be better but not expecting much anyway, recommended for casual dining. The bun cha was quite good. Crispy egg noodle was great, but eggroll needs some work.</text>< gmap_id>

Authentic food from northern Vietnam.  I had bun dau mam tom (which include a special shrimp paste sauce,  a salty, fragrant sauce with deep fried tofu, boiled pork belly, deep fried meat cake, noodle and fresh vietnamese herbs.) Be careful with the sauce,  it needs a bit of lemon or lime to balance it out.
Wet also ordered bun Cha Ha noi. Similar components,  except the meat is prepared with coconut juice and fish sauce.<//review>

Mediocre northern style Vietnamese food,  their dishes taste normal to me,  nothing's special. Even the most praised dish "bun dau mam tom" wasn't all that. Never,  its probe is very affordable. Service is above average compare to other Vietnamese restaurants.< /text>

<Text>My new favorite place for bún riêu! Grilled sea snails with butter and garlic were tender and flavorful $8.50 although shells are feeling apart but didn't affect flavor. Bún chả was pretty good $9 but I recommend asking for another small bowl to eat from combined with noodles and veggies as the pork broth is served in can be quite salty but savory. Bún riêu $9.50 is by far the best I've ever eaten at a restaurant! Interior is very cute and tastefully decorated. Parking can be a bit challenging if you eat during peak lunch and dinner times. They also deliver using Postmates and use Five Star point rewards system. There's also another new location just opened Nov 2019 at Bolsa and Magnolia.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo_keSRg64hTLW2FlJ7FD7v5zawrj8eQYAfgy0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH6sRxDmvgf5qyV5oyZBW4QNRu9HEPzj_cev-M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD7GWRrRRYtsFlqaSS1uaL6SQsVy81r80yIqdc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfZ8_ZV5aZEKJvkVIPUy5xqyP8FxFyQPkOXtUm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIottOq3b6BuyOkBZAl0F6XUiDijObtR_tiydB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaV05wXLM6St_TBOPg4uDj2MBHdUTkq8dBJCxV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJqayuM_mk7U5pJCD_YPQXL-zO1ruV5eVcyOni=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMybdF_Ijzd27rBRS7B6o9EqvOSS5m6GuNevwlP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZh9a3TQVL7nP6ZqC1UN0S-R4lwtZlVZXgLQoO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZ2p8rGjkOdkUXwieNG-S6KwAjjxuD5cXQGdVO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

<text>We came here on a Saturday night, there was no wait for a table (for four) even though it was busy.  The service was great, the ringers on the tables let them know when you are ready to order and they are there within minutes of pressing it.  We tried several dishes, the soups are fantastic and the garlic escargot are delicious!!<//text>< user>

There isn't too many places that offer this dish, but this place is number #1. Also this place is a low key boba shop/restaurant as well. It boba is high quality same as other boba joint.

We were surprised at how average the dishes are.  We’re even puzzling at how it got such a great reviews, too.  We ordered the basic northern dishes, grilled pork (bún chả Thăng Long), fried shrimp and sweet potatoes, fried tofu and fish paste dill vermicelli soup, all were very average.</review>

<Review>The food was fantastic, as you can see in the pictures. We got the bun rieu (tomato crab noodle soup), banh cuon (rice paper), popcorn chicken, and corn milk. All were delicious and the biggest surprise was corn milk for me -- who knew corn in liquid dessert form tasted so good?

The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and modern. The painting in the main dining area is fantastic (you'll know it when you see it).

A great and affordable spot.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPByXmujk5A6ioJ4p7KkNHhke67puIrdEhRJ3xe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNudW799Z_ggBFNUa49LQ8PIMKfdw4C7rnb09uw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><name>Evan Le<//name></record>

Doesn't not taste like Ha Noi foods. I was expecting a lot, but it didn't meet my expectations. "Chả cá Thăng Long" didn't have enough "thì là". "Bún đậu mắm tôm", the tofu was too dry, the noodles was also dry, fish sauce was not salty enough.<//text>

Everything in the menu uses the right flavor for the Northern's food in Vietnam. Highly recommended if you want to try how the Northern's food tastes.</Text>

This place doesn’t have your traditional beef noodle Pho. When I arrived at the restaurant I was a bit disappointed to find out they didn’t have Pho. Either way I order the Bum Thai Tom Yum and it was pretty good. However, for me, this was a place I tried once and never again. Great Soup but no Pho.< /Text>

Yes, yes and yes again. Some of the best North Vietnamese cooking I've had in a long time. We were visiting Anaheim, and this place came highly recommended, so a $24 Uber ride later, it was so worth it. The food comes quick, piping hot and delicious. Next time I find myself anywhere in SoCal, I'll come back!</text>

<Text>So far I've tried one thing and I'm hooked the teas are tasty service is great. I wish I could come more often but eating out can be bad if you do it a lot. Never feel super full always leave happy and it always feel like I'm not paying enough for all the food we get.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBmDzthK9LWJjuGOsrkllUJkZHhLqpokUJBaQS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

This in an interesting restaurant. The smell upon entering is not something you can call pleasant.  It smelled like old fish sauce and a bit of old rag mixed with heavy fish broth. The food came out and it was pretty good, good enough to eat but not good enough to make me want to come back anytime soon. Most of the food came out within 5 minutes of ordering.  It makes you wonder how they get it ready so fast?! We ordered some escargot.  It was heavily garlic-spiced flavored.    If the garlic was cooked out a bit, it would have been better.<//review>

The food was all delicious (we had bun cha and bun thit nuong cha gio) and the drinks were excellent (passion fruit ice tea with basil seeds and ice coffee).  The server was really friendly. One note: when you're done, you pay at the front. They don't bring the bill to you.<//Text>

The new noodle soup was very good. I would rather eat this menu than just regular pho. The soup wasn't greasy perfect for the combination of all the ingredients.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>If you are craving for a good bowl of bún riêu then you are in for a treat at Ha Noi Corner. Their Bún riêu cua lột Hà Nội (soft-shell crab, tomato and tofu vermicelli soup - Ha Noi style) is as good as it gets. The eye-catching broth, the wonderful aroma along with the different textures of the ingredients make their bún riêu cua lột absolutely fantastic. I have been there so many times and only a few times in which I was able to order something else.
Don't get me wrong, they have many delicious dishes here but Bún riêu cua lột Hà Nội is my go to dish!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS3tIE9SZEg_fWEvR2PDi_Sw6MWNPmcuL2Iuqw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd28901cdc306f:0xa39be0546952ebf4<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I love this place! Portion is very big you can probably share between 2 people if you don't eat a lot. They don't have a lot of selections but every single item on the menu is spot on! Prices are also on the low side - less than $10 per item.

Parking can be a little tricky if you come for dinner since they don't have a lot of parking and you will probably have to park in the residential area right next to it. They also have a rewards program if you come a lot and pay by cash!</Review>

Had Bun thang here and Garlic Butter Mussels and Bun Cha Ha Noi! Everything was delicious and authentic! I love how prices are VERY AFFODRABLE (most items under $10) and everything is VERY SHAREABLE with another person or more.

Love the variety of AUTHENTIC NORTHERN VIET DISHES!</text>

<Text>The food is spectacular and spectacularly affordable. The Cha Ca Thang Long is second to none. The flavor and composition of the dishes are true to its Northern roots. They only lose 1 star for not for serving booze, parking, location, and a bit laxidasicle staff.</Text><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

The food are delicious; an outstanding Vietnamese restaurant I would say. Highly recommended if you're looking for a casual restaurant. Plenty of tables and parking lots. Menu is simple. Food came out pretty on time whenever I was here for lunch. Service and space were normal compare to the price of a one $ place. The reason I keep coming back is their Seasalt Cream Tea, tasty and refreshing! Never forget to order that!< /Text>

I ordered the Thai seafood noodle soup and it was delicious! The place is clean and nicely decorated and the staff are friendly & attentive. They also offer Northern Vietnamese dishes that are hard to find at other Vietnamese restaurants in the area (because a majority specialize in Southern Vietnamese cuisine).<//Text>

I've been here twice this week and the service is fast and accomodating. I was properly greeted at the door and seating was quick. I ordered about 4 entrees and everything came out within 5 minutes.. Probably the quickest service ever at an Asian restaurant. I would recommend this restaurant!!< /Text>

Nice spot in Garden Grove. This place offers a different menu from the typical Vietnamese restaurants. We ordered the popcorn chicken, crispy egg noodles and egg noodle pork soup. Fast service in a casual dining atmosphere.<//Text>

<review>My go-to place for bun rieu!! Must add the mam and fresh chili and it’s perfect. PLUS you get a soft shell crab with it. 😋 I’ve also tried their escargot with garlic butter and pepper and it was good as well. I come here at least once a week!!< /review>< pics>

Food was excellent and very well priced, average plate is about 8 dollars and you get a good amount of food. They have a nice variety of lemonades but there are no refills. The motchi ice cream sandwiches are really good but a bit pricey.<//Text>

<review>They are known for the bun cha ha noi. Meat patties are super moist and delicious. I like the fact that they use lean pork for their bbq meat/thit nuong. Parking sucks though and on the weekend/holiday forget about service. Last time we ate here they didnt give us our drinks until we were done eating 😑.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOyb7rIP8llsYwEp_09WKQJkyubod-DVuKrwMQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

One of my favorite places to eat bun cha Ha Noi. They make it with your choice or regular vermicelli noodles or flat rice sheets. I had tried both and although both are good but the flat rice sheets are my favorite.

Their service is fast and everyone is so nice. They speak both English and Vietnamese. Servers are patient and will make suggestions if you are unsure what you want.

I came here for Mother's day and received a free Macaron Ice Cream sandwich. They were delicious! I would definitely recommend this place! A must try if you are in town.< /text>

<Review>The Bun Cha Ha Noi is satisfying and delicious! It's on the salty side, so definitely have a drink with it. That won't be too hard because they have a large selection of flavored and milk teas to choose from. The honey boba is soft and chewy. It's on the sweet side though, but I liked it. I've been here twice in the past week, and the service is was quick and friendly both times. Depending when you go, parking can be tricky and you may have to park further down the street by the houses if the parking lot is full. The entree selection is smaller compared to other restaurants, but that just means your choices are probably all good.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dd28901cdc306f:0xa39be0546952ebf4<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

First time here and I already like the surrounding of this place. Super friendly and excellent customer service. You know is legit when they have less than 15 items on the their menu.< /Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Name>Rachel Phương Lê< /Name><text>Everything we got was very good, the sauces that accompanied the Spring rolls and the wrap it yourself meat platter was so good. A very nice balance of sweet and salty.

Parking is a pain, very limited. Service was almost nonexistent, but expected. We had to try so hard to flag down a person, but it's not a big deal.

Restaurant is clean and big, we got sat down pretty quick. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the banh duc, a tad too soft, and salty.<//text>< time>

I don't like it the fact that they make you or charged you for tips automatically with the bill. It's not that I'm cheap, but the service is not all that 5 🌟 type. It's not fair for restaurants to forced us the customers to paid for the waiters/waitress salary, especially when no one really check you how you are doing and you have to yell for service. Tips is for good service NOT forced.< /review>

I came with a group of 3 people. We shared the baby clams with rice crackers and devoured it. We each individually ordered separate noodle dishes. I had the Bun Cha Ha Noi and it was delicious!</Review>

Modern , clean and spacious. Food is great but my wife, who is from Northern Vietnam, said it is not 100% authentic Ha Noi dishes. Still it is a breath of fresh air since Ha Noi  Corner offers a lot of tasty and unique dishes that I haven't see at any other restaurants in OC.
6/9/2018: still good, but not as good as before.<//text>

I love coming here to get my authentic Vietnamese food. They specialize in northern Vietnamese food which is a nice switch from your typical pho restaurant. In addition, they have boba as well! I highly recommend coming here if you’re in the area.<//Text>

Some interesting northern dishes. I have been twice and I think the quality is inconsistent. I think it's worth it to try dishes you can't get elsewhere but typical dishes like the bún chả Hà Nội were disappointing.<//review>

Their specialty dishes are delicious. Quite unique too as it's not your stereotypical Viet restaurant with just pho and spring rolls. Great variety and lesser known dishes.

Again try B1 on the menu. Really delicious flavor I haven't seen elsewhere. Drinks are ok but a bit too sugary in my opinion. I would recommend asking for half sugar.

For the price and taste this place is a solid 5/5.< /text>

<review>Great Bun dau mam tom! I love their Cha com fried cake, very crunchy and tasty. However, the waiter didn't pay much attention to our order. We asked for water with no ice and still got two cups full of ice (it was not very crowded) 😐. Overall, it's a good place to try Vietnamese food.<//review>< Resp>

Food is cheap and it is really good quality. However, The table is small and uncomfortable for our group. Because we have a group of 8 people. Overall everything is good except the uncomfortable table.<//text>

This is my go-to spot for lunch with coworkers. Prices are reasonable and the portion is right. The snails are a miss but their bún đậu mắm tôm (vermicelli with with tofu, boiled pork and vegetables) is good.</review>

The restaurant is nicely decorated. The food presentation is attractive. The service is friendly. The chilli sauce is fresh and super spicy. The herbs are fresh and clean. The bun cha came out warm and I was envious of my girlfriend's sizzling hot plate of cha ca. The flavor was good. I'll probably go back to try something else from the menu.< /review>

I love all the options of noodle here. The newest dish "bun rieu cua lot" with soft shell crab took a lil bit too long. Nevertheless, the food is consistent and service is great.</text>

< Review>
You know they give out free milk tea if you write a review right? That means you can't really trust the review system anymore! Well, I got fooled by all the advertisement. Advice to people who want to try good Vietnamese food: this is not the place!!!

Rear parking is limited, side parking is scary and weird.
Inside decor is nice.

Service is bad! They forgot about half of our order, then the waitress came out and ask us "oh the food is not out yet?" Uhmmm I don't work here girl, idk?!!!

Food:
Bun cha Hanoi is supposed to be the signature dish of any Hanoi restaurant here in OC, but they made it poorly: the meat cake was dry, the fish sauce was really salty... If you know Vietnamese cuisine you know that the sauce is the most important part of many many dishes. They failed with this signature one.
Bun dau mam tom was a 3.5/5, I have to give it to them on the mam tom though, they made a good job with the sauce on this dish. Just the cha com was terrible, it's like eating a very moist sticky rice cake being fried...
Bun ca was a disappointment! The soup isn't sour enough. It seems to me like they don't put in the effort of making the different broth for different noodle soup. Bun ca has its own kind of broth, pho has its own kind of broth, bun rieu has its own kind of broth....

In conclusion, I don't like it!!! You might get better dishes than we did maybe.... At your own risk you come in!< /Review>

{'time': 1527721709228, 'text': "Annie, We tried to explain to you that it was not mold but you didn't want to understand. It was the ingredients layering under cold AC. The bottle itself was opened a day before and still had the expiration date until 2020. I bet you didn't even read the expire date when bringing it to us. We didn't apologize because it was not even a fault. We just simply answered your question and gave you the explanation you wanted. We did nothing wrong to receive your 1 star but here you go. Again, it was not mold, and yes we did care about the customer opinions and tried to explain to you but you chose not to listen. We are a busy restaurant and only use fresh ingredients to cook, and we don't stock too much to maintain its freshness. If it was mold and if anything wrong happened after you consumed it, feel free to come back and we will show you the receipt of the supermarket we bought it from just a couple of days before so you can complain directly to them, or you can even complain to Huy Fong company since the bottle has the expiring date until 2020. But from our experience and a lot of other consumers' experience, it Was Not Mold, just the layering of ingredients. I'll leave it here for you to Google some more before you bring the same complaint to other restaurants serving sriracha."}<//response>

This place had mold in their sriracha bottles. Unfortunately, I realized it after I had some. I reported it to the staff and manager but they didnt seem to care. They didnt even apologize for this. Their food wasnt anything to rave about. I wouldnt come back.<//Text>

< Review>
My first impressions of the overall appearance and aroma of the restaurant were, “Suits the name perfectly.” The restaurant is located quite literally on a corner and the inside aesthetically pleases your eyes with the brick walls and dining booths. I visisited this place with my family and we ordered a variety of dishes from Cuon (Spring Rolls) to Escargot to the classic Bún cha Ha Noi (Grilled Pork vermicellli, fresh herbs, and fish sauce). They were relatively tastey and easy to consume. What I would recommend from the Ha Noi Corner specifically is their B1. Bun cha Ha Noi. I swear this is only second to pho when it comes to authentic Vietnamese food and it is amazing! The servers were also quite responsive and friendly. Overall a very nice restaurant for Vietnamese food!<//Review>

We’ve been here twice in one week! I love viet food because it’s so fresh perfect for this warmer weather and their drinks are on point. The husband liked the bun Thit Nuong and I liked the bun Cha Ha Noi. The salted Carmel milk tea was so yummy! I’ve also tried their lychee drink and that was also super refreshing.< /text>

Writing my review for the free sea salt cream jasmine tea. Otherwise, my opinion is purely my own.

I had the 67. bun rieu and it was delicious! I think it is the best I have had in O.C. I also tried the clam porridge and it was very interesting. The iced coffee macchiato with hokkaido cream was also a treat. I liked all of my ordered dishes and drinks! Would recommend and would come back!

I'm taking 1 star off because there was a piece of plastic wrap in my Gf's porridge lol.< /review>

Got the clams and bun rieu. Clams were really good. Bun rieu was ok, but it did have a whole soft shell crab! It's hard to find bun rieu comparable to home at a restaurant tho.</Text>

The food here is great!  I especially like the bún chả Hà Nội.  This is also a great place to come for milk teas.  Parking may be a little tough, but I’ve never had a problem since I avoid the busy times.  The only thing missing from this restaurant is alcohol.</Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Had the fried egg rolls. Was 3/5. Seemed over fried with not that much filling. Good herbs though.

Entree was the crab bun rieu. 4/5. Broth was perfect combination of sweet, salty and savory but the half soft shell crab was underwhelming. Honestly, I'd rather have more crab mix, or Cha lua. I think it's all presentation. The crab mix was mixed in a ball too well too. I like my bun rieu crab mix scattered.

I'll want to try another joint before coming back for this bun rieu.< /Review>< pics>

I love this place, my favorite dish is the Bun Rieu Cua Lot Hà Nội.  My wife introduced me to this dish and I can’t stop eating it.   The service is fast and friendly.  I also had the Bun Cha Hà Nội, very good.  You also have to try the Lychee drink with basil, refreshing.< /review>

I really enjoy dining here at any time of the day.
It is absolutely delicious and the presentation of the food is well represented.

I was craving Bun Cha Ha Noi and found this restaraunt on yelp. I wanted to try a new restaraunt and drove here. The restaraunt is "not in your face" and from the direction I was heading, I had to make a U turn. I did not have trouble finding parking, but this place could get packed.

We were quicklyy seated and the staff were very nice and polite. We sat at the booth and it was spacious. They hire just the right amount of staff that you do not need to chase them down if you needed something. The menu was straightforward and there were photos to go along with the food items. I ordered Bun Cha Ha Noi and my mom ordered a variety platter. The food came out very quickly. The food presentation was adorable with the banana leaf and so. They put a whole bottle of water on your table for your and their convenience. The cups are cute and perfect size.

Bun Cha Ha Noi had the right amount of additives to it, it was very flavorful with vermicelli noodles and the meat were fantastic. They make it just right and perfected the dish that their was no pork smell to it. I really enjoyed it and so did my mom. I have not tried their desserts but can guarantee that their main dishes are worth the drive, at least for me since I am not around the area. I also signed up for their phone list to earn credits to receive freebies, it is a neat concept that I do not see most Vietnamese restaraunt does.

We had such a great meal, my mom asked me to drive her back here again the next time. And again, we had a good time, it was not packed when we arrived in the morning. The service, again, was excellent and the food was yummy. I highly reccommend this restaraunt.< /Review>

Heard about this restaurant from a friend so decided to give it a try.  Found parking in the rear of the restaurant. The place has nice decor. I ordered the Bún Riêu Cua Bể it came with 1 soft shell crab and the broth is good. I like lots of tía tô with my bún riêu but didn’t came with enough mint; hence, reason for only 4 stars. Will definitely come back to try other dishes< /text>

I wish this restaurant was closer to me. I'm a Viet born and raised so I know how authentic this place is. The food was ridiculously good and cheap for the price. I tried sooo many restaurants in the area for the right Bun Cha. This place has it right. I was devouring it. Do yourself a favor and came to this place right now!

Still love this place after coming back again!<//text>

We found this place on FB and decided to give it a try.  We screened thru the menu and pricing is pretty reasonable.  We ordered Tom yum noodles, bun thit nuong and banh Tom co ngu.  Bun thit nuong was delicious. Banh Tom Co ngu could be better if we ate it right away. Tom yum soup was not bad either.  The free sea salt jasmine tea was the bomb.  The server was extremely courteous, excellent service.  We will definitely come back.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Accidentally ran across this shop and was hungry. Try Thang Long Fish Cake. The children brought out very quickly, which meant no need to wait long. Seeing that the noodles and fish bowl are suddenly peeling and the smell is very good already. Eat into the confusion. Prices under $ 10. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with pictures of Hanoi streets. Serve well Ok. The stewardess introduced here delicious rieu vermicelli, which many diners favor. Looking at the menu, any dish I like. Maybe a few days stop to try something else.

Vô Tình chạy ngang qua quán này mà đang đói bụng. Ăn thử món Chả Cá Thăng Long. Mấy nhỏ mang ra rất là nhanh, tức không cần phải đợi lâu. Nhìn thấy măm bún và thố cá đang có lữa kêu lột đột và mùi rất thơm là biết ngon rồi đó. Ăn vào mê muội luôn. Giá cả dưới 10$. Nhà hàng trang trí rất đẹp với tranh ảnh phố Hà Nội. Phục vụ cũng Ok.  Cô tiếp viên giới thiệu ở đây món bún riêu ngon lắm cá nhiều thực khách ưa chuộng.  Nhìn cái menu thì món nào mình cũng thích.  Chắc vài ngày ghé qua thử mấy món khác.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Specializing in selling dishes from Hanoi! The best thing for me is that there is a shrimp-bean noodle soup that is delicious. There are also snail dishes, vermicelli, rice, and noodles made in the Hanoi style. The seats are quite comfortable, the staff here are quite attentive and enthusiastic, everyone can come and try it out!

Chuyên bán các món ăn đến từ Hà nội! Đặc sắc nhất với mình thì có món bún đậu mắm tôm là ngon. Ngoài ra còn có các món ốc hoặc bún, cơm, phở làm theo kiểu Hà Nội. Chỗ ngồi khá thoải mái, các bạn nhân viên viên ở đây phục vụ khá chu đáo và nhiệt tình, mọi người có thể đến thưởng thức thử  xem thế nào!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>
