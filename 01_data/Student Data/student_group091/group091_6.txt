This place is a friendly, always stocked, great prices, and selections. This is the main spot for me. I’ve gotten flower, edible, and some gear...even a mask. Would recommend to anyone interested in quality at a decent price and not overpriced quantity. Service is fast and friendly and they don’t lie to you about their knowledge of your concerns.  5 star</text>

I normally have a great experience here but unfortunately today I want to go buy a big chief cartridge and some flower. When i got home after about 30 minutes. I decided to open the cartridge and noticed that most of the wax was gone. Only a small amount was there.  I thought that was weird . and when went to put it on my battery the wax was coming out of the bottom . i am so mad. Even with the quality of the flower. Hella dry . i tried calling the store multiple times but no answer . all it said was enter your password for remote access. The hell.</Text>

Theres better product out there for much much less.
This place gets away with selling low quality product because people are not informed about cannabis and don't demand good bud.
I bought a 29% thc eighth (as advertised) and was given a 21% total thc bag.< /text>

<Text>I have been going here since they opened and have spent thousands of dollars here.  They didnt have what I came for so I had to go up to the next level. My bank didn't deposit my paycheck same day as they always do and I was fifty cents short. Would they work with me? HELL NO!  GO TO WEDEN ON GRAND AND ST. GERTRUDE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. THE 1/8'S ARE $5 CHEAPER AND BETTER!  I wont be returning to this place!!!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I've had issues finding good dispensaries since moving from colorado.  This place is the best I've find in california. Their flower is fire.  They have a great edible selection.  The staff is always great and efficient so you never have to wait forever.  I appreciate this place and its staff.  Way to come in for the win!< /Text>

<Review>Terrible Place to Buy your Medicine, I went there for my first experience at 2 days ago, I got A puffy Cartridge, The Woman that helped me said it was better then select, It tasted and smelled like Burnt popcorn from the first hit, never even Got a head Change from 2 Big Blinker Hits!! When I went back the Next day with Receipt and original packaging the Same Woman was there, she wouldn’t do an Exchange or Return. Told me to email The corporate office , I did but no response. I Feel taken By this shameful Business. $36 Dollars is allot of money too me so If this helps And I can save you from the same Experience  I’m Happy . OC3 Medical is right next door. there incredible and help in any way if your unhappy with the Product.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Long time customer but lately the service has been declining. They have been running out of the best flower and they close early so call ahead or find another shop -- odds are this one is closed already, again. Or learn the hard way and believe their claimed hours as I did. A little customer service goes a long way but this shop forgot that. Plenty of willing neighbors, no need to put up with the hassle at "nice" guy.</text>< UserId.>

They just lost a loyal customer. Earned a full punchcard over the past few months of visits and I was just told that they are no longer honoring the terms of the punchcard (free 1/8th). Unbelievably shortsighted business decision (as well as highly unethical). Lost a very loyal customer and I'll be telling friends as well.<//Review>

Picked up some moldy weed from this place after being a solid customer for a long time and they didn’t care .
It was one bowl shy of an eighth
Don’t shop here - go to People’s OC instead- right by this place
Nice guy has weed that’s been sitting for yeArs and it’s not worth the time or money< /Review>

When I got home NOTHING WAS IN IT. That’s right no joint in the tube. JUST WOW. On top of the terrible customer service place does NOT care about its patrons. Most of the products aren’t great and the prices are high for what you get. DO NOT RECOMMEND.< /Review>< date>

I like to go with friends to this restaurant with my warmest recommendations. I  go to this restaurant often. I get very good feedback from my friends. The dishes they serve are delicious and the crew is efficient and cooperative. Whenever we eat in this place we have a gorgeous evening.  warmly recommended.< /text>

It could be better if they didnt give so much rice on their bowl  plates or should ask the customer because they give you less of the entrees.<//text>

Just ordered for pickup. I m glad I checked if teriyaki chicken had teriyaki (it didn't). I asked for the sauce butt I definitely felt like I owed something to the guy. Great service. No "hello" or "thank you" or even goodbye when I said thanks.< /Review>

<username>Cyn Thompson< /username>< Review>
The really enjoy eating at Panda Express. They're a little more on the expensive side in terms of fast food restaurants so it's kind of a special treat when I do go there for my family. My problem is with the soy sauce. I happen to really enjoy my Chinese food a lot more when I have soy sauce with it. For some reason at Panda Express they make you ask for the soy sauce when you at the register when you pay for your order. That is fine. But when the cashier acts as though they are going way out of their way to get you some or simply lies to you completely about putting some in your bag already, that's what irks me. That's exactly what happened to me three nights ago. I didn't realize until I got home, a few miles away from the store that the cashier lied to my face and put no soy sauce packets in my bag. They act like the cost for those packets come out of their daily wages or something. I realize I can go to the grocery store and buy some for myself which is what I'll do, but my point is that's something they provide with your meal there and why should I be made to feel like I'm bothering the staff for asking for some or just flat out be lied to? I know I'm not the only person who feels this way about Panda Express, I've spoken to many people who all feel the same way. I wonder how many  customers they've lost over this.</Review>

Panda Express is fairly consistent.   This was no different.   My only complaint is they always make a mistake on my order.  I like white rice and mixed veggies or chow mein.  They never get that correct.  But the restaurant is always clean and the food always delicious.< /Review>

This place was on it. They all said welcome when you come it. They all say thanks for the donation/ bell ring. It was an overall good experience. Cleanliness was good as well. Drive through is speedy and prompt as well.< /Text>

This is a cute little place with very sweet staff and a lovely garden out back where you can eat. We had delicious chicken salad salad and brought back a few baked treats for later. Definitely recommend!</review>

The Garden Market is a charming place to enjoy breakfast or lunch. Staff was friendly; the bakery items I had were good. The hot chai latte was excellent. Nice gift shop with bottled honey and other items for sale.<//Review>

< review>
The food here is great. The service however is almost comically unacceptable. The woman that owns the place is a bit nasty to customers and I don't think she cares. She likely does not know how nasty she is to be honest, but that doesn't make it okay. Several mistakes were made to my group's order. When we asked the management to make good on this they were a bit annoyed that we asked them to redo our food and give us what we had paid for. These mistakes happen almost every time I have been there. The food is good, so I keep giving it a chance for some reason. The managers also seem to have similar nasty attitudes. Not what you would call a welcoming place. The setting and food is decent, however. I can't say it doesn't have good food. If you are looking for a lunch spot that is welcoming, friendly, and provides good service, this is not the place for you.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I went with a group of 40 seniors, the place had known about us coming by 1:30pm. First, they didn't have enough tables available for us & 2nd, they didn't have any of the sandwiches we had prechosen ready. I waited for my vegetarian avocado sandwich for almost an hr.& by the time I got it, the avocado was practically none... I went to get coffee & 3 out of the 4 containers were empty, no half & half neither. Their "special" ice tea was also gone & so was their lemonade... such a bad experience 👎🥺<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzbkvsweEmkibvc4n6Eem_f4R7XCHMzJD3HTmS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfkwgeJXz8kGlsLX1f0PsTNU8XMpAc_a8BBgAG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeuJSpb2KkUYeLaG9jby3G39sDQSlYoKjbBb3-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>Atmosphere and setting are relaxing and pretty. Food is pretty good. 1 star off because service can be lackluster and their menu and hours are a bit limited. Should definitely be checked out at least once if you're in the area though, it's a unique SB area setting.< /text>< Time>

A local favorite which also caters to tourists, this deli offers a wide range of sandwiches and salads within a chic gift shop.  Come for the outdoor patio seating in back.  Your meal and conversation may be interrupted by either the aggressive birds or a train blasting past the property 30 feet from your table.  I recommend the turkey meatloaf sandwich.</Review>

We love this place for a quiet lunch on the patio. The sandwiches are gourmet. We like the "gourmet turkey sandwich" with roasted red peppers on a delicious bread. All ingredients are fresh. We also drop in for an egg breakfast now & then on the weekends. The staff is friendly too...</review>

Beautiful, relaxing garden is a perfect place to stop on your way up or down the coast for a quick delicious bite, or coffee. I love the meatloaf sandwich.</review>

We live in Carp and have been here a handful of times. Without fail, the service is horrendous: slow and impolite. We wish this large space on Santa Claus Lane could be used more resourcefully, or perhaps ownership/management could change. Food is descent.</Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>7-Q is conveniently located given the sprawling area surrounding the store. Yet, experiences within have been reminding me of when a dictionary's clarity shares a text describing, "Cordial."
The definition regards genuine sincerity as cordial, NOT polite etiquette. Although thanks are spoken in abundance from the clerks, there's an underlying unpleasantness permeating through our exchanges.

Fantastic local shop with friendly service and great little selection of food staples in a relative grocery desert.  This place has saved me a few times when I needed to grab a couple ingredients but didn't want to drive to the grocery store.  Their beer selection has a little something for everyone and it's all chilled, ready to go.  Wine and liquor price and selection is on par with a corner liquor store.< /Text>

I have been shopping at this store for 4yrs. I've always had good experience.  The owner and other employees are always friendly and helpful. The prices are reasonable for a convenience store.<//text>

Steals your money beware! Make sure you check your change because they will short you on change! Also they will change prices on you all of a sudden. I would drive down the street to another liquor store.</review>

Kind of pricey, but convenient and the guys who own and work there are super nice and funny. And they have a great selection of liquor.</Text>

Watch them they will charge you extra money on your purchases if you don't pay attention. Some employees are rude.</Review>

They intentionally sell curdled milk that they get at a discount. Even the chocolate bars there are expired. They sell a wide selection of expired goods knowing full well that most people don't have the time or energy to haggle over the items.<//review>

The place itself is very nice, good selection of food including healthy stuff and comfort food. Staff are very nice as well.
The only reason for 4 stars is that the food in the end is a cafeteria food (even if better than most others) vs really tasty food.< /text>

Decent food considering it's a hospital cefeteria but they close extremely early and some places aren't even open on the weekend. It's as if they think the hospital clears out at night and nobody ever gets hungry.<//Review>

<text>Paw Commons is absolutely fantastic! My dog loves coming here and will jump into the arms of whoever is there. I have had him boarded, groomed, and spent the day for daycare there. Every time has been a great experience. I can't recommend it enough! Not to mention I can watch on the webcams.< /text></record>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>Very new customer so this is subject to change.  I like the idea that they request a 4 hour assessment before accepting the dog - it seems thorough.   I like the zoom camera so I can check in but my dog hasn't been playing with other dogs there.  He's been standing alone which may just be his own feeling like an outsider. But my goal is for him to play and have fun.  I'm sticking with it because it's new, clean, safe,  great staff, etc.  I just wish he'd mingle more.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Five stars!!! The staff is always friendly and kind, I know when I leave my dog he will be loved and well-cared for. The groomer is amazing and the price is fair for the services received.

I love boarding my dog here overnight and even sending him to daycare for the day. He always has so much fun. The staff are awesome and knowledgeable about all things dogs. You can also watch your dog play on a web cam while they’re playing to see how much fun they’re having< /text>

<text>Visited San Diego for a vacation and the hotel we stayed at we were told was pet friendly but when we arrived with our pets they said they meant pet friendly for service dogs only. So last minute we  had to find a pet resort for our dogs because the hotel we stayed at would not refund us to get a diff hotel that was pet friendly for all dogs. We found the Pet Common Resort last minute they were honestly the best and very professional.  They were clean and took amazing care of our pets they really helped us out when it was needed. They truly care about their customers pets. I truly went to bed knowing that my dogs were safe and in good hands because of how well they treated us and them. Definitely recommend this place if your visiting San Diego or just need to get a break this is the perfect place to book your dogs stay or play time.</text></record></dataset><record>

This place is dodgy, called for pricing completely incondistent with the website, I won't be bringing my dog here because I can't trust a company that advertised one price and has different higher ones when I call.<//Review>

I drop my dog off here at least once a week while I have to work. They take great care of him and it’s an excellent way for him to socialize with other dogs. He sleeps like a baby after a full day doggie daycare</Text>

I found out after the fact that they use negative reinforcement, and as an already fearful and anxious dog, I’m now worried of the lasting damage this experience will have on him. While I understand different philosophies exist with regards to interacting with dogs, I think this information should be clearer to owners when they’re deciding where to board their dogs because my dog responds particularly badly to negative reinforcement and may now be too traumatized to board in the future. They also neglected to feed him one of his meals. I typically don’t leave reviews, but for those with dogs of a similar temperament, I’m hoping this experience will be informative when they’re making a decision as to where to board their dog.</Review>< UserId.>

<review>I bring my dog here weekly for daycare and she LOVES it. Staff really cares about the wellbeing of my pup as if she was their own. I also love knowing that some days during my work week my dog is able to socialize and enjoy her day rather than being cooped up inside my apartment. PLUS she is always sleepy after, perfect for when I have evening plans. Wouldn't bring my pup anywhere else! They also have an amazing puppy 101 program.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpsaSv9vU3U71tFkBx4Em2eUg57LWmy9ESCuTM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
The prices listed online are extremely misleading. A boarding fee per night is to be expected but the additional daily fee to have someone watch your dog, plus mandatory insurance, plus an additional fee if you can’t pick up by 1pm, and another fee on top of that if you can’t pick up by 7 has you spending more than twice what you should. God forbid you forget to bring treats from home.

Money aside, when I picked up my dog, they told me she’d had a bit of diarrhea, which they said was probably just stress. She came back extremely sick. She’d lost a lot of weight, was sneezing, choking, vomiting, and had uncontrollable diarrhea. On top of that, she howls when left alone, which is the primary reason I didn’t leave her alone at home while I was gone. When I picked her up from this place, she had completely lost her voice. It’s been two weeks and her voice is still very hoarse. Therefore I have every reason to believe she was left alone for the entirety of her stay, excluding her occasional potty breaks and very expensive scratches on the head.

Pros:
Polite staff.
They gave me an update on her eating habits.
They opened their doors late so I could still pick her up after my flight had been delayed. (But then they charged me $25 for it)< /Review>

< Review>
Christie is an amazing trainer! We have worked with 3 trainers before finding her, and none of them were able to help our dog Harper. He was having issues socializing with other dogs, it was so bad that we couldn't really walk him because if we saw another dog he would lose him mind, oh it was horrible and so embarrassing. Christie worked with us and with Harper to help him become comfortable around other dogs. We have trained him (with all of Christies help!) to look at us for direction, before reacting to a situation. Money well spent! I only wish that we would have found her sooner!! As for the rest of the facility, I love it. Everyone is very nice, and knowledgeable,and they always remember your dogs name. Day care is great, the staff always has someone in there with the pups. You can just see how happy the dogs are to be there.</Review>

BETTER THAN MOST

It's very challenging finding dog boarding or dog day care and trust strangers with your furry family member. Some places I've brought my dog too had great first impressions and then quickly becomes a horrifying experience after actually bringing your dog there. I was tipped off about Paw Commons and heard nothing but good stuff. This review is specifically for this locations.

But first... let me get this out the way
1. Hillcrest is the only location that has indoor and outdoor playrooms. Bay Park and Encinitas locations only offer indoor playrooms.
2. The trade-off, Bay Park and Encinitas offers Standard rooms AND Luxury Suites for dog boarding. Hillcrest only offers Standard rooms.
3. No overnight staff at any of the locations. And limited hours of drop-off and pick-up.
4. They have cameras in the playrooms
5. They separate small dog from big dogs

THE EXPERIENCE.
They require Rabies, DHPP, Bordetella, and a temperament assessment. By this time, Chloe is use to having temperament assessments every weekend (we've checked out many pet resorts). I decided to bring Chloe to the Bay Park location since I reserved a Luxury Suite when I go on travel (although I prefer to her be at the Hillcrest location). Temperament Assessment is not free like other places - the cost is $10 and they keep her for 4hrs minimum. I dropped her off and the staff seemed like they haven't yet woken up from the weekend. It was I who has to initiate what needs to happen by asking alot of questions. After 4+ hrs I picked her up and again no comments. I had to ask a bunch of questions for them to basically say she did well. Please staff, be more vocal. I asked for a tour and they called someone from the reservation team who was super vocal and friendly - I liked her vibe more than the front staff, she was more welcoming and didn't sound dead. I am so happy I reserved the Luxury Suite for my dog, its a big room with a high bed, couch, and flat screen tv - makes them feel like home. I did see the Standard room and was impressed that it's very spacious - imagine a tall room with the width of a twin size bed. Overall, Chloe seemed happy coming out of this place. I even spied on her on the camera and was happy to see the playrooms were not packed and all dogs were getting along and she was being taken care of.

So far, so good.

Until the next review...</review>

<Review>You CAN teach an old dog new tricks!  We love our seven year old dog Elliot, but over the years, we had been resigned that our lovable mutt either couldn't understand us or chose not to. When Elliot started going crazy around other dogs on his walks, we decided it was time to get professional help!... Thank goodness for the Golden Paw Pet Resort.

Our trainer was incredible.  He carefully guided us step by step through the training process, he accommodated our busy schedules, and more often than not, went way beyond the what was expected from the lessons, to make sure that our dog (and his owners) both got the the training that they needed.  We were overwhelmed by his commitment to helping us and we were inspired by his passion.

Elliot is a new dog... He's still the furry mess that he's always been, but now when we call him, he UNDERSTANDS that we are trying to connect with him.  He locks eyes until he figures out what we are trying to say.  Its truly amazing!

We recommend the Golden Paw Pet Resort to anyone without reservation.  Because of them, we have reconnected with Elliot and we look forward to life with our 'new' furry friend.</Review></record></dataset><record>

They are amazing! Our dog is very timid but loves everyone at Paw Commons and actually has gained some confidence since going there. We had a hard time keeping weight on her but since going here she has kept a steady weight because she loves their food. They make everything so easy! Since our credit card is on file we can get everything for our dog in one place and don't even need to wait to get checked out.  They will have the food and my clean dog just waiting for me so I grab it and go.<//Review>

My dogs really love this place and it's nice to have peace of mind when I have to leave them that they are well cared for and happy. I also like that I can go to The Golden Paw's website and view my dogs anytime of day via their webcams, either in the playrooms or in my dog's private room. The owner and staff are incredibly nice and great with all of the dogs. The facility is clean and well maintained, and offers great services including grooming and training. I am incredibly thankful to have the found such a wonderful site to leave my dogs. I highly recommend The Golden Paw to anyone looking for daycare and/or boarding.< /Text>

We have taken our dog to Golden Paw for over 5 years! Their staff is extremely accommodating and knowledgeable. They have a great inside play area at the Bay Park location and do a great job with the overnight stays. We also take “Elle” to Golden Paw for baths and haircuts. Our dog always comes back happy! I recently looked at their new Hillcrest location, and the outside play area looks amazing! We have been a loyal customer for over a half-decade because they offer a great service at a fair price. I have no hesitation recommending Golden Paw to anyone looking for this type of service. Keep up the good work!<//text>

Two words: LIFE SAVER! My boyfriend adopted a high energy breed dog. He is a great dog, but it's impossible to tire him out and he has separation anxiety, which is common with this breed.  This combination has made training really difficult. Leaving him the first time was worrisome.I have to say, the staff have been absolutely fantastic, from minute- one they listened to us and gave us great advice. They really want to work with the clients, both dogs and people to make for a winning situation. The webcams are great but don't expect to get much work done on your pups first day, I was glued to the cam! I think then could tell how worried I was, they even called to give me an update on him. He was a little stressed at first, but now our "problem child" loves going to day care. HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF FOR HIS TIRED PARENTS! Doggy daycare at The Golden Paw has done him a ton of good, he's much easier to work with at home and more relaxed in general. Thank goodness for The Golden Paw!< /Text>

We brought our Schnoodle, Ruffles, to Paw Commons San Diego for a bath and haircut this past week (Yuri was our groomer) and could not have been happier with the results!  Not only did he look adorable with his new "teddy bear" cut, but he was happy and comfortable when he came out.  We will definitely be going back to Blue Pooch for our grooming needs and would recommend Blue Pooch 100%!

Thanks Yuri and Paw Commons San Diego!< /Review>

An amazing experience with a fantastic trainer is the way to describe Christie and Paw Commons. I can't say enough about the wonderful experience as a result of the training Christie provided for our dog Luca, and the great staff, who do everything possible to keep their clients happy. (Doggie clients being the number one priority).
Luca went for an evaluation with Christie. Christie gave Luca necessary training which provided proper discipline, structure and confidence. Only positive reinforcement strategies were implemented, which was extremely important. Luca is able to socialize with animals and people, without any worry thanks to the training Christie provided.
Christie is professional, intelligent, caring and dedicated. It is obvious she loves what she does and takes pride in the results she receives. Christie wants only the best for her doggie clients, and we appreciate this greatly. My husband and I can honestly say Luca is absolutely a much happier dog as a result.<//Text>< Pics>

Just went in for an evaluation. Seems like a nice place. Friendly staff, and decent prices. You can get webcam access to your dog during boarding.</Text>

<Text>Pros- Indoors and air conditioned, big dogs and small dogs are separated, web camera, great price, the trainer spent a lot of time with me explaining her program, everyone seems nice enough.
Cons- My puppy was there all day and I watched on the camera- I never saw a single dog play out of the 50 or so that were there. Not one single romp -ALL DAY. The dogs are just walking around aimlessly. My puppy came home tired, but not due to play, she didn't nap all day, likely due to anxiety being in a new place.  Another downside is the dogs pee and poop right there INSIDE. I realize they cannot have an indoor play area and take dogs outside individually, but I personally don't want to erase my housebreaking efforts.
If I HAD to leave my dog somewhere, I would feel safe leaving her here, but it certainly is not the answer for a bored puppy day to day. I was expecting fun, fun, fun, run and play, come home happy and tired. It is of course not the fault of anyone that the dogs did not play, simply my observation, and this did not meet my needs. I have watched other doggie daycare web cams and find it appears to be the same. I would rather hire someone to take my puppy to the dog park. Also the parking is limited and getting out is a challange.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I have had a great experience with The Golden Paw over the last few years and highly recommend their day play and boarding to anyone looking to put their dogs in a safe, clean environment while they are either at work or on vacation.

We have used many of their competitors in the past and this is the first time that I have actually taken the time to write a review because I was so happy with the service that I received.

The staff at the Golden Paw really take pride in what they do and it shows.  Jessica, Tiffany and Kelly are awesome and they are always happy to help with keeping our dogs happy and healthy during their stay.  I cannot tell you how much we appreciate their willingness to help with our last minute plans, whether it be heading out of town last minute or getting caught in a meeting and not being able to pick the dogs up on time.

With two kids and everything that comes along with that, it is very nice to have such a great staff at The Golden Paw keeping our dogs happy and safe until we can get there.  We have two pretty high maintenance dogs (a short hair pointer and a miniature pincher) and both are worn out from play at the end of the day when they get home so I know that they love the experience also.

In fact when I first started going there it was like pulling them into the front door of the vet's office with all four paws locked up and being dragged across the floor.  Now they are both pulling their way into the lobby once we get to the parking lot and they really seem to be having a good time when we check in on them from the web cams.

Our dogs are really a part of our family and that is why I wanted to take a moment to write this review and hopefully give other people the piece of mind in knowing that the Golden Paw really is a great place to send your furry little family members.</text>

This business offers free day care to those who write them good reviews. They have had promotional signs on their counter. In my experience, they denied me services because I wrote a bad review for a particular groomer who has a terrible sense of customer service and refused to answer my questions about why grooming my 8 lb shelter dog took 4 hours. She was combative, and overall unhelpful to ease my concerns about whether my dog is kept in a cage for a long time.</review>

Each time you come in you have complained and none of our solutions seem to make you happy. Each time you have berated our staff and groomer. This groomer in particular has been with Paw Commons for almost 20 years and probably has 99/100 positive if not glowing reviews.\n\nFor some reason you aren't happy with our services but you continue to request new appointments. While we are 100% focused on customer experience and satisfaction I don't think we will ever be able to meet your needs.\n\nWe wish you luck on your search for a new groomer and are sorry we couldn't satisfy your needs.\n\nKind regards,\n\nBen Vosberg\nCEO Paw Commons Pet Resorts"}<//resp>

The Paw is the only place I'll board my dog. The staff is attentive to the clients (both human and canine) and they maintain a high standard of cleanliness and safety. I trust my dog in their care. Were it not for The Paw, I don't know what I would do. It's wonderful to be able to leave town and not have to worry about my dog!</review>

A tired dog, happy mom!!

My dogs attend doggie day care weekly. The paw staff continues to give exceptional service. They both come home happy, tired and ready to eat. Without the constant socializing our dogs would be at home tearing apart our house while we are working. I also "tune" in (webcam) daily just to check on them.

We are excited about the new facility, having an outdoor place and new friends to play with what else can we ask for!<//Text>

<review>I just want to warn everyone to make sure to request a statement which shows the breakdown that they charge you.  We found out they overcharged us twice and we only been there three times.  We choose them because they have web cam but they are just way too expensive.  We are going to look somewhere else from now on.</review>< pictures>

<Review>The owners and staff at this doggie day care location in San Diego have a genuine love for all dogs and they treat yours like their own. It's amazing when you walk in and they know your name, your dogs name, and the name of everyone else and their pets getting dropped off at the same time of day. You know the dogs are all treated very well when you leave because they have webcams so you can check in on your furry child and see how much fun they are having at day care! They have a new location in Hillcrest that is nearby so they should always be able to accomodate your dog as a guest at their fine pet resorts.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I can't thank The Golden Paw staff enough for taking such great care of my dog!!!  Jessica, the manager is amazing and leads by an exceptional example of kindness, understanding and altruism.  The girls there: Amber, Ariel,Yesi, Genevia, Rochelle, Michelle, Sami, Chelsie and Jazmine, are all amazing!  They are so special and loving to my Doll.  They accommodate my work hours, treat her like their own, alert me when she's not "Herself," and go the extra mile to make everything perfect.  Recently, my dog had a major medical illness, and each of the girls, called or texted me to inquire and express concern for her and me!  Their kindness and love is unprecedented!  I can't imagine a better place for Doll to go to when I am not with her!  Thank you Golden Paw!!  Thank you for giving her love, play, fun, and her meds!!  And Ben, the owner, thanks for allowing the flexibility!  She loves her pack there and she is happy, healthy and safe when she is with you all!! The facility is very clean and has webcams, and every time I log on to check out my girl, I see at least 2 employees cleaning up something and someone else hugging a dog! They are such hard workers!  I appreciate them all!!<//Text><gmap_id>0x80deaaea87394c13:0xf81b1a40e34b6ae8</gmap_id><Response>None<//Response><rating>5</rating>< time>

<Review>Highly recommend Classy and Classic. They cleaned the outside and the door jams in under 30 mins, and did a fantastic job. Price was reasonable and their attention to detail and efficiency were remarkable. Definitely go here!</Review>< pics>

<review>It's got the feel of a family BBQ. There are plastic chairs all over the place to sit on. I wish I got the names of the dudes that worked on my car, but i didnt :[. They talked to me though. About all sorts of stuff before it got busy. We talked about movies, the pomelo i was eating, health issues. They do the work by hand and hose. Nothing fancy and the results are great. It's my kind of place. CASH ONLY<//review><Response>None<//Response><Rate>5</Rate><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Rudoggivic< /username>< Time>

Excellent service.  I was in a rush and simply expressed that to the manager/owner, where he allocated additional resources to get me in and out.  Not to mention, they paid great attention to detail!<//review>

Price went up from the $30 I was told when I pulled in to $40 when it came time to pay. Great car wash, otherwise. This would be 5 stars if they hadn't ripped me off.<//Review>

I just brought a newly purchased used car to them that needed some love :)  I chose to do the full detail service. They had it looking, feeling, and smelling brand new in under an hour!  Charles was super professional and made me feel like I was getting this service done by a close family friend.</review>

This place used to be great. Though this time I had a really poor experience. I waited nearly and hr and a half for my suv to be cleaned (there was only one other customer there at the time) and they did a really poor job. Didn't even bother to vacuum the back of my car and left some trash piled on the back seat. They used to have way more people on staff hustling, with attention to detail. The guy cleaning my car even took a break I will I was waiting, just him and me there, so I had to awkwardly watch him smoke a cigarette and talk on the phone mid cleaning. Service was too poor for me to return, which is unfortunate as I prefer to support local businesses.</text>

<Text>Friendly people, but they did not do a good job detailing and I had to point out many areas that were ignored. They also had to be followed up several times about timing - I was told an hour, then they still hadn’t worked on my car yet, then I was told another 15 minutes, when I returned they still hadn’t started on it. It was 2 hours before I was out of there, and who knows how long it would have been if I hadn’t been sitting there and they finally started working on it. I would have even been okay with that if they had at least done a good job, but while the shampoo was fine, the detailing was very inattentive.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Good service.  Staff washed and vacuumed my Rav 4 very well, to include dirt, grime, and bug guts from a 3700 mile cross country trip.  $40 plus tips was well worth the hand wash and attention to detail.  Tires detailed and polished dry all over.  Place looks a little sketchy but don't worry...just come prepared to discuss Oakland sports. Picture is of wash results.<//Review>

I brought them business from my truck, mom's truck and girlfriends car. Last and final I went I left mom's truck there (Mothers Day) and I left it there for three hours, three full hours and the car hadn't been touched. I asked to get inside shampooed and detailed, I received nothing. Then when I showed up they started putting wax on the car telling me the full detail will be done soon. I asked for the inside to be done because clearly I washed the outside. I said no I have to go and Terry (the owner) tried to charge me 60 bucks for that little bit of wax the guy put on my vehicle, ALSO THEY STOLE THE CHANGE OF OUT MY GLOVE COMPARTMENT<//review>

And ive worked in the area for many year, now I drive thru here at least once a week and would stop everytime. Until now I stopped here everytime. As of today I will no  longer step foot at this rude ,disrespectful location. What happened was I parked not at a pump but beside them. Mind you would park here all the time to run in and grab a coffee etc.well today I park and turn around to the rudest cashier ever came up behind me and said I needed to ove because he couldn't see he the other trucks that I needed to move now!! I told him I am going to get coffee and then I will I went in got my coffee. Mind you this whole time only o e other truck was there and wasn't going anywhere no time soon they were broke down. Here comes that first cashier with another cashier telling meto leave now and not one time did the talk with out yelling and cursing no please nothing just RUDE!!*!!!** SO they said trucks can't park where it's made for trucks                                                       .<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Excellent vegetarian Viet foodz.  The vegan Bún Húê is very tasty.  So are everything else they cook in this tiny kitchen.  Eaten here for years until COVID hit last year.  Now they are open and cooking delicious Viêt vegetarian foodz.

I get the foodz to go and re-cook them at home.  I add more stuffs I like to the already tasty soup.

Ignore all the negative comments.  They are from cried babies Millennials who somehow didn't get their ways.  The foodz is excellent.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL-lXuJIxS14EVIXVOCTjaeJtYwE6QYMyCSIha=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnNG_Z-c_jtGn3HpxWmybykSaq_6e0xmvpY0L7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgYkcwRYJ1uQcRU35h2VvLdUTGgo2nCXSa2vuW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

This place is a hit or miss. The foods are precooked and sit out, whether they are kept at an safe temperature is uncertain. Sometimes the food smells fine. Sometimes the food smells like it’s been sitting out too long. Lunch plates get reheated in the microwave unless you’re ordering some kind of soup or fried item. The reheating and cooling down could be the reason for the smell if you’re not eating it right away. Or ask that it not be heated up if you plan to take it somewhere when you can reheat it when you’re ready. The options available for lunch combos varies. Overall, it’s still pretty good. It doesn’t blow your mind, just decent.</review>

Awesome value for delicious vegan food. Went for the chow mein lunch combination with friends and everyone was very pleased with the food. There's a ton I'm excited to go back and try next time I'm in the area. Great customer service.</text>

<review>Fantastic vegan Vietnamese food at a place that is a bit run down, but you won’t be disappointed by the flavors and textures. I had the fried rice with 2 main dish choices for $9 and an even $10 with a Soda. Cash only.

Staff are friendly and its fun to listen to them speaking Vietnamese amongst themselves and with some local regulars.

The owner said he opened this shop more than 35 years ago after coming from Vietnam. The vegan ‘meats’ were originally made using bananas, but they now use soy base or jackfruit.

The vegan kebabs and chicken were really tasty and filling. I’d been frustrated by the lack of vegetarian options when I visited Vietnam in the 90’s, but the owners assured me I would find a lot of great options now. Such friendly people.

For sustainability, eat-in diners on reusable plates and utensils but to-go in plastic packaging in plastic bags it seems (so bring your own to save in take-out waste if you can).</review></record>

It might look like a hole in the wall, but you step inside and the best vegetarian food awaits! Everything is vegan and you won’t believe it because the “meat” both looks and tastes like real meat. You really can’t go wrong with anything in there. The combo plate food in the little window is excellent, the egg rolls are to die for. My boyfriend and I have been coming here consistently for three years and we always order a soup (bamboo soup and vegetarian pho is awesome!) and I always get the vegan banh mi (#11 sesame “chicken”)! We don’t live in California anymore, but every time we come to San Jose to visit family we be sure to come here.< /Text>< user_id>

My new go to for Vietnamese Vegan eats.  It's cash only and holds a few tables inside and outside.  I had the bamboo soup for $9.50 and it was packed with flavor. Hard to believe it's all animal free!<//Text>

My first time there today.I got there at about 10:00am . I bought three items. One item was smell and that item was not much left right there and the lady give me a lot of it. I was thinking oh she's nice. When I got home ready  to eat open the box it was smelly. It must be the left overs from other days. That's why she gave alot. This is first time I wrote the review. I am very  upset.<//review>

Excellent vegan place! I try to stay away from meat options but my boyfriend is a meat-lover. Impressed us both. My boyfriend announced he could be vegan if all vegan meals tasted as good as theirs. Great prices and friendly staff. However, seating is quite limited so I advice you visit at a relatively less busy time.<//review>

<Review>Certainty a FoodAdventure. Stumbled upon this place while briefly in town. A compete, 100% #vegan Vietnamese Pho hole-in-the-wall eatery. No seafood, no bone broth. All plants. No hipsters. This place is run by Vietnamese and is therefore entirely ethnic with no trace of pretentiousness. Staff is super nice and were helpful to us with a certain personal issue (left something at their cafe). Only the tiniest little remark- the imitation meats could be of slightly higher quality, and perhaps more emphasis on tempeh/tofu as meat replacements would work better in making the meals just that bit More Healthy< /Review>< Pictures>

This place has the best vegetarian pho I have ever had. If you come here for the first time order the pho to get hooked. They also have other dishes that are very tasty but I personally always go for the pho. This review brought to you by a meat lover. Don’t ever let this place go out of business I would be devastated.<//text>

One of my top places for quality Vietnamese food. This location is absolutely outstanding. The service was very welcoming and sociable. Bring your appetite because portions are filling. This place has many great reviews for a reason.</Text>

<review>Everything on the menu is vegan and reasonably priced (~$10 for a meal), and their imitation meat is delicious! Best vegan/vegetarian pho I've ever had. The broth is flavorful unlike many other restaurants' veggie pho which are bland and unsatisfying. I also enjoy their large variety of deli items - highly recommend the kung pao "chicken"< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808fccbe4eeb9e49:0x37835f7d918af290< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

what to order: Bun Bo Hue chay
tip: metered street parking, ca$h only

I love eating Vietnamese vegetarian food because we do it so darn well  and Tofoo Com Chay definitely did not disappoint!

I wish I could have taken some to-go but I didn't bring enough cash.

The Bun Bo Hue was a good size for lunch, flavorful and full of veggies. It wasn't the best Bun Bo Hue Chay I've had but it was good and hit the spot.

While I was eating, a lot of customers came in to order their various dishes. They have several combo options- similar to when you go to a Chinese styrofoam box type place.

Would definitely come back to support the mom&pop restaurant!<//review>

< Review>
First off, it's great to know that this small whole in the wall is trying to do veggie/vegan vietnamese.

It came recommend from a friend and unfortunately it did not meet the hype and expectations.

I was disappointed to experience difficulty navigating and understanding their menu. While the food is "cheap" it lacked in flavor and freshness.

I visited around the lunch hour and it was evident that the food had been sitting around from the AM. I chose to try their Sesame Veggie Chicken Sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised when a fresh roll of bread was placed in the oven to crisp up. That's where the glam of the sandwich ended. Next the "meat" was pre-made and microwaved to serve. The "meat" lacked flavor and quickly became cold.

Additionally, I ordered their Summer Rolls. I was happy that a range of "meats" where inside the rolls. The sauce that accompanied the rolls was the one thing that saved both my rolls and sandwich.

I do not plan to return. I think the idea is great and as a vegetarian, I am always looking for new and creative ways to enjoy food. Tofoo; however, did not live up to its hype and at best, I didn't even "get what I paid for."<//Review>

I ate here for the second time. The first time the food was alright but this time it was a terrible experience. After ordering our food my friend and I sat outside and this server guy came outside and kept telling us they're closing however it was 30 minutes before their closing time and we saw people still eating outside and inside and new folks still going in but he made it a point to only tell us that he's closing not to anyone else. On top of that it got really uncomfortable when he got in between our personal conversation repeating what I said to my friend. My friend was taken aback, she even remarked maybe he doesn't like brown people. What a terrible experience to give to your customers.</text>

Seriously THE MOST delicious vegan food I’ve ever had! Everything was so flavourful! I will be back whenever I can.  And can I also say the owners are beyond sweet! They have owned and operated this place for over 20 years and truly cook from the heart. It’s a small hole in the wall, but feels like you are eating straight from their home kitchen. Absolutely delicious! Love love love!<//Text>

<review>The food is beyond excellent! The only reason I'm not giving this place a full 5 stars is because the location is so bad. Also, I once decided to take my food to go, but it just wasn't the same quality as eating in, which was a shame since I would love to eat this more often, but it's just too much of a hassle. Other than that, I highly recommend this place at least once since the food is amazing, and there are few vegan places that can compare.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fccbe4eeb9e49:0x37835f7d918af290<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

BEST VEGAN PLACE IN THE BAY AREA. The food is so good and they have affordable prices which is why im able to go here so often. The banh mi's here are the best and you really cant find a better banh mi elsewhere. My bf isnt even vegan but he loves their banh mi's.< /text>

My go-to place for inexpensive Vietnamese vegan eats. This hole-in-the-wall is a gem and popular with SJSU students and many locals. I live in SF and drive down to San Jose just for the Mì Quảng noodles, which I can't find vegan and delicious anywhere else. (I used to go to Mint & Basil for those, but they've really gone downhill.)  Sometimes I take an extra order to go for the next day (hint: ask them not to boil the noodles or they get soggy when you reheat them).</Text>

<text>My favorite vegetarian place in San José. It's tiny and there's nothing flashy about it but the food is delicious. They've got a wide range of dishes available and I've enjoyed everything I've tried. The rice plates are great but the only thing I eat there anymore is the soup. To my understanding, it's fully vegan but the broth is on par with the best beef-based broths I've tried elsewhere (depth of flavor wise, not that it tastes like beef). The service is always quick as well- a great place to stop if you're in a hurry.</text>< gmapID>

< Review>
Came in after placing a mobile order for a 'Rustic Tomato and Burrata Salad.' I've been a major fan of Sweetgreen featuring burrata cheese in their seasonal menu items. This particular salad that I ordered was exclusively online on the app for this location. I added blackened chicken thigh and swapped out the dressing for a pesto vinaigrette.< /Review>

<Review>As a carnivore, I just have to say that this place is really great. My favorites are the grilled pork banh mi, the drumsticks, chow mein and the meatball skewers. It's a really tiny place that only has a few small tables though on clear days there is a table or 2 outside. I've only ever got my food to go.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Best place for vegan food. Try the pho and the noodle salad. I swear, the "meat" tastes like real meat. I don't tell my meat eating friends that they're eating vegan until they are finished eating and raving about the food. Several years ago, Tofoo Com Chay fixed up a platter of food for me to take to Maui for my daughter. She loved it.</review>

Vegan, if not, for sure vegetarian hole in the wall place with Vietnamese food. We love the spicy noodle soup and I love their salad. You can also get a rice plate with choice of two or three items. Only thing to remember before going is it is cash only!<//Review>

Bare-bones is quite correct.
Not even close to being worth a
special trip to eat Vegetarian food.
Super-tiny inside with few choices,
likely good for locals or the downtown
lunch crowd. Not in the best of areas.</review>

They have been here for more than ten years Erving vegetarian food at an affordable price to San Jose state university and the people and the community in general. Always fast service; do prepare for crazy lunch traffic so avoid that time of the day. You can request them to modify, example have the pho noodle to go with the yellow noodle.

Inexpensive over-the-counter vegan food, best for take-outs. This isn't a "5-star" restaurant, just lovely vegan fast food in a hole-in-the-wall place.  The spicy noodle soup, fried rice, drumstick, spring roll were all excellent.<//text>

<Review>I work around the corner from this little shop and come by often. I really love their spicy soup, especially on a cold day. Their rice dishes have pretty hefty portions, enough to save for later. My favorite is the lemon grass tofu. Only complaint is that its not always available. And it's cash only. Not a lot of seating so I usually get it to go. It's a great find.</Review>< pics>

<Text>The food was okay, the portions were great but the tofu wasn't great and has to be reheated in a microwave. It was very small sitting area with decent decor and the service was good and friendly but in a hurry for it being 1:30pm on a Tuesday<//Text>< pictures>

If you are looking for the Vietnamese vegetarian food. This is the go-to place. It's the best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in the bay area. All their soups are really fantastic.<//Text>

I only knocked off One Star because it is still at least a true vegetarian restaurant, and they make awesome vegan turkeys on thanksgiving.</review>< pics>

Probably my favorite veg restaurant in SJ! The food is so tastey and the owners and staff are kind and patient. I highly recommend the special fried rice, the teriyaki chicken kababs, the spicy noodle soup, and the vermechelli noodle soup! They DO make the food ahead of time and microwave it, just in case you have a problem with that. It's cash only!</Text>

Thats exactly how service is supposed to be and we all practice what Buddha tell us - be kind, be generous and you will get back more than what you give. I highly recommend Bamboo noodle and Chicken skewer because they are cheaper and more delicious than rice plates. Overall, its good!</text>< Date>

Cash only (would've been helpful to know that when I was ordering) and tiny portions of unappetizing food.  Pho was clumped up and noodles over cooked.</Review>

Tofoo Com Chat has really good vegan options that are tasty. You may find sometimes that this place can get packed easily. So getting something like pho would be  a hassle without proper seating. The prices are average but it is normal for vegan restaurants.</review>

But I gave 4 stars because the missing star is for garbage customer service. When I see people ignore an elderly lady and she is met with a "what do you want?" When she asks if she can be helped? That's gross. And I also was given a death glare because I didn't know what I wanted yet. Saw several employees rolling their eyes at each other regarding customers. Straight disrespect.

Thanks for the pastry though.</Review>< gmap_id>

This place was pretty good. We went on a Saturday around 11:00 am and there was a line to check out only. We didn't have to wait to get in. I got the sourdough bread, cinnamon raisin bread, and m&m cookies. The sourdough was my favorite and toasts really well on a griddle. I wasn't too fond of the cookies. They are hard. Not bad but I like softer cookies. They still had a good taste though, very buttery. I liked the atmosphere and was going to stop by there again on the way home from Mammoth bit the line was out the door and around the building.< /text>

Always a great place for fresh baked sweets and awesome bread. Bought Garlic cheese and sourdough. Plus a cinnamon nut pull apart.
Only downside is the sweet goods dry out within a couple of days. Bread lasts much longer.<//Text>

< Review>
I stopped here on my way home from Lake Tahoe. I wanted to stop on my way up originally, but the line was unbelievably long and just not worth it. Thankfully it was more reasonable on my way back and I was able to stop. The line moved pretty quickly and they had a mist machine over the line (which was nice, but a little too strong as it actually got our clothes a little wet). There are quite a few tables out front for eating.

The inside was pretty crowded and people weren't really following social distancing. Everyone was required to wear masks though.

The pastry and food are separate lines while the rest of the baked goods are all spread out around the store. There are no prices listed on or by the items, instead there are laminated sheets with prices listed so you need to know what the item you are interested in is called in order to know the price. All the pastries were unlabeled so I had to point and ask what something was and then check the price. This is not a great system because it takes a lot longer and then the lines are slower.

Prices are as expected. A little on the pricy side, but I get that it's a popular place and kind of a tourist destination.

The food and everything tasted really good. I had a good overall experience.< /Review>

This place could not be more delicious and delightful. It's our pitstop every time we come home from Mammoth, which is about once a month. My favorites include the bacon/egg/cheese croissant, the DARK chocolate peanut butter cup, the poppy seed muffin and my mocha coffee with two pumps peppermint. Some other faves include the pull apart bread and the coffee cake. This place is an absolute MUST!!</Review>

Sandwiches were huge.  We stopped on our way back to LA from Mammoth and it was everything you read about.  The breads and pastries were great.  They have amazing sandwiches and while the li es were long it didn't take a lot of time to get in and out with our orders.</text>

<review>Impossible to socially distance inside and sandwich menu is mostly turkey, the worst deli meat. I tried some of the sweets. Pastries were less than remarkable. Cherry Danish was just pie filling and the pastry dough was not fresh so nothing rose properly. I got a selection of the breads and found them to be better but not worth the madhouse of parking and whatever inside is supposed to be. Layout could be improved upon. If this was a normal small town bakery I'd be more impressed but for how they market themselves I expect much better. I will try again post pandemic and see if that was a factor.</review><Rating>2< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

Prices are higher than let's say at Alpine Village Market in Los Angeles. Well, I guess that's to be expected in a location close to Mamooth (?)<//Review>< Pics>

We live in Los Angeles and our neighbors lovingly brought home some goodies from this bakery. Oh my gosh, they were delicious! We had some cheesy bread stick things (I don't know what they were called because my barbarian husband ripped open the bag as soon as he had hands on them) and a delicious loaf of pullaway bread! SO GOOD!!! Next vacation, we are definitely making this a visit during our travels.< /review>

<text>My sister recently took me to Erick Schat's Bakery on our way home from California. I was so glad she did because I ordered the best full size BLT. They did not spare the bacon, avocado and anything you wanted on this sandwich. We split it and I was still stuffed. I could have spent at least two hours perusing the store because of all the delicious breads, cookies, salt water taffy, Boston beans, salads, cakes and pies, you name it oh, this place had it. I cannot wait to stop there again next time we plan a trip to California.</text>< Pics>

This is an absolutely awesome bakery!!! There so much to choose from in this bakery that I had a hard time making choices. They have all kinds of delicious breads, cookies, pies, pastries, coffee, donuts, honey, a deli that preps sandwiches as you order and much much more. They also have a sitting area out front that is nicely shaded.  I would definitely recommend this bakery to anyone!! Great customer service! Very friendly staff! Just an awesome place to go for the entire family!< /text>

<text>Interesting and very old European bakery in the town of Bishop. There was queue to get in due to COVID 19. Once inside, we got lost in all the varieties of goodies and breads. We picked up sourdough, cookies and lunch sandwiches. Everything tasted great. Bit pricey but that’s expected for such a tourist spot!< /text><Name>Manish Sathe< /Name><Time>1607320344671</Time></record>

The best bread!! We had to wait outside in line for about 10-15 minutes, but it was well worth it. The bread is so fresh and delicious. The best sourdough I have ever had, we got the frqncisco style extra sourdough.< /Text>

I LOVE this place! Their Extra Sour San Francisco Sourdough is fantastic.  All their other breads are awesome as well, and so many choices. Cookies, pastries, deli sandwiches, candies, breakfast croissants... It's ALL WONDERFUL.<//review>

You'll take a few loaves of bread home with you. You won't be able to help yourself!  Huge bakery with cookies, eclairs and cakes.  Tempanades, aoilis and other items for sale. We came for a couple of sandwiches for lunch, and walked out with 2 bags full of bread and goodies.</Review><user>116488691080079236437< /user>< Rating>

Vunderbar! Best selection of baked goods and famous shepherd bread fresh from the ovens! Grabbed cherry strudel, cinnamon pull apart bread, danish and prepacked sandwiches for the road. Lucky to get in early before weekend crowds.< /Text>

Seeing the high reviews, we spent over $50 here for all kinds of breads n tarts. Offers a huge selection of baked goods. However not a single item was great and the tarts were very disappointing. Not a fan of baked goods made with canola oil.<//Text>

<review>Schat's Bakery is an oasis in the middle of a desert. If you like bakeries, you'll love Schat's. Every imaginable loaf of bread, pastry, cookie, dessert, and other bakery goodies. Lunch, Schat's is also the best place in town for sandwiches. Only drawback, everyone else driving through town on 395, and locals, wants to eat at Schat's, and the lunch line is long but moves fast. I wish I lived in Bishop just to be able to go to Schat's Bakery. On hwy 395, hit the Disneyland of bakeries in Bishop, CA.< /review>< name>

Really cute bakery with lots of variety! You can even get beef jerky and pickled peppers here! I bought some of the pancake mix bc of the cute satchet it comes in and I can't wait to try making the pancakes! You can even buy the bread flour mix. Their cream puffs are also really amazing.< /Text>

We stopped here on our way home from Lake Tahoe. Lines are always long. A little bit on the expensive side. They are known for being the home of the original Sheepherder’s bread. They have lots of Danish pastries, breads, cookies etc. The sandwiches and pastries were good.</review>

The Bakery felt dirty and the servers were very unfriendly.  The pastries and muffins were very heavy and not tasty.  The Schat's in Mammoth (different owners) is so much better, cleaner and the pastries much lighter, flakey and vastly better tasting.<//text>

Loaves of bread shaped by hand and baked in European stone hearth ovens ~

You can smell the fresh bread from miles away!

This place is just awesome! Cute as a button! So many different varieties of cookies, cakes and pastries! Breads are baking in the ovens, wide variety of sandwiches are offered for a great lunch inside or outside. There are also tons of treats available for purchase such as jams, honey, pickles, jerky, candy, etc.

We loved our lunch and the pastries we took to go were also fantastic. Don't miss this lovely place and take some goodies to go with you. Perfect treats for road trips!!!< /Text>

I think I got caught up in the hype train as well.
Though this review is obviously based only on the things I tried - chocolate croissant, some apple dessert pastry, and a cinnamon bread stick. And the amount of time it takes.

The place is honestly fine. But I really don't think it's worth the wait in the line. I went in at 7:15a thinking that was a good time. (Just figured I can't rhyme. Anymore 😬).

Anyways, there was a 15 person line by the time I got there. The line outside moves pretty fast to be honest, but the line once you are inside (to pay) takes forever!

The bakery is huge and they have racks and racks of breads and various bakery items. It's very difficult to socially distance, once you're inside. But they do mandate masks, which is good.

I walked around lost not knowing what to get - ended up picking up some of the things I saw others picking up lol.

The croissant was alright. Especially if you're expecting something amazing, you will be disappointed. There is not a lot of effort made into the layering of the croissant, which makes it not particularly crispy at all.
The apple dessert pastey was meh. Same issue with the bread being all soggy.
The cinnamon bread stick was pretty bad. I could only eat a part of it before I threw it away.

I was expecting the items to be at least warm, given that I was picking up so early in the morning. They were not warm at all. Makes me wonder when the baking is done.

I have an apple pullaway and an apple strudel, that I haven't tried yet. Hopefully they are good.

Given the number of pastries they make on a daily basis, I guess it's understandable that they don't put in the effort to make all individual pastries taste and feel good. So it depends on what you are going here for - as long as you don't expect amazing stuff, you won't be as disappointed.

Also, try to find a time when there is not a lot of people waiting to get inside.</review>

The bakery items are below average - they must use margarine instead of butter.  Also the cookies and some of the bakery items tasted old to us.  We also ordered sandwiches and there was almost no meat and was not anything I would recommend.

The small white Mountain rolls were good.</Review>

Great Bakery and Sandwich shop,  they have pastries, candy all kinds of breads, bagels, strudels, pull apart pastries in  peach, apple, Dutch crunch, cinnamon etc. The bear claw ring is great warmed with butter and a cup of coffee. They have so much to choose from you can go crazy! But only in a delicious way....< /review>

I'm glad that we stopped by this bakery when we travelled along 395 (as everyone says you should). Their bread was amazing and almost magical - it was such a joy to me to simply taste a slice of the bread without any dipping! The Danish was also one of the best I've ever had. Their sandwiches might be a bit dry but I still liked them for their freshness.< /review>

They were amazing. It was actually really nice to be able to go in and look around. I know they are limited in how many people are inside, but it made a huge difference for us. I really liked not feeling packed. Thanks for the amazing sandwiches and the cookies. ♥️♥️ Not to forget the sourdough we get everytime we drive through the town. ♥️♥️</Review>

We went Saturday and there was a line in the afternoon around 230-3pm because they only let a few people in the store at a time. No problem,  the line went fast and it was easy shopping.  Hurry by 3 as the deli closes then and you want to get a sandwich,  they are wonderful!<//text>

A must-stop location on your way through Bishop! Then enjoy your treats at the park across the street. It gets suuuper busy but they do well with covid protocols only allowing a certain number of folks in at a time. Parking lot is often full and the line gets long in these covid times.</Review>

<Text>What a unique place!  If you have a sweet tooth or enjoy carbs like I do, then this is the place for you.  From breads, to pastries, to donuts, to coffee, to ice cream....  Very good and fresh.  It's right on the 395 Hwy and you can't miss it.  While it's popular, the line moves pretty well so don't miss the chance to stop and enjoy.</Text><Time>1604543459836</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><userid>116942360883603755431< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Stopped by around lunchtime to get a sandwich on road trip. Line for fresh sandwiches was pretty long, so I got a pre-made one. Would recommend if you're in a hurry. Only reason it wasn't 5 stars was the cookie that came with the sandwich wasn't what I'd expect from a baker, maybe a bit stale.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>This place is an experience!!! Soooo many good items to select from and all made with love. Definitely worth the stop up the 395 to/from Mammoth mountain. We had the split pea soup which was thick and full of flavor. Also had the turkey sandwich and roast beef. To raisin cinnamon bread is not to be missed! We've eaten it for breakfast and dessert. We will be back!!!!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Love this deli bakery market combo! Stopped here for lunch got the half sandwich and soup combo. I was definitely impressed. The half sandwich is huge thank goodness I was hungry. I got the hot pastrami sandwich it was delicious. I would say it's a great place to stop for some food on the go, but still want to enjoy. Also got the olive bread and some dipping oil to bring home. I would suggest stopping here!<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFrh4FLrxYd9BkGfIAOXDaD9vh6Jj0qKfwvmSC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

Came for a drive all the way from Los Angeles just to come to this bakery, but soooo worth it! 🤤🤤🤤 Love their cheese danishes, strawberry preserves, raspberry preserves and honey. Loves how there's so much to choose from and they also have a variety of breads. You can also grab a bit and get one of their sandwiches. Great place to stop for some treats.</review>

<text>Carb overload but very worth it. We were driving through town and one of my friends said we had to stop here because they had the best breads. Walking inside Schats Bakkery the smell alone of the breads that were freshly made smelled sooo good; there were so many different options I was not sure what to get, but I knew I wanted to try at lease 1 item; some of the options were Banana nut bread and cheese croissants, cheese danishes and all kinds of flavors of cookies donuts they also had salads and they had premade heated turkey Popeyes they made sandwiches, fresh sandwiches which they had sandwiches already premade just so many different options. I went with a donut and some chocolate chip cookies; I did feel bad at first for purchasing these items but they were worth it and I did not feel icky after eating them they were light and right. This bakery is worth a stop by for sure.</text><time>1599407112193< /time><user_name>Lish Lish Fitness</user_name><Gmap_id>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e</Gmap_id>< pics>

<Text>You have to stop by and just see the selections available. I can bet that you will never come out of there empty handed. There are just too many wonderful varieties of baked goods that you probably have never seen or eaten elsewhere. They have a great deli where they make some of the best and most delicious sandwiches. Its the fresh bread that is their secret.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Sandwiches were a little bland but the atmosphere was great. Definitely worth a visit if you’re passing through. Highly recommend the cookies!  Parking can be tricky. Always crowded.

Update: get the hot pastrami. 10/10 would recommend.< /Text>

<Review>Anyone that stops here will never "pass by" again! They're just plain awesome.
Turkey sandwiches are made to order from fresh roasted turkey. Grab a small side of their homemade cranberry sauce for the sandwich. There's only one thing I don't like about this bakery, it's too far away from my home! 😎</Review><Name>David Ochs<//Name><user_id>116496797802223224458<//user_id><time>1602462298235<//time><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<Text>Liked their vegge sandwich. They serve lots of good stuff. Some stuff you can try before you buy it. Sandwiches freshly made at your order are around $9 for a whole one. You also can get them to go made on your request or from the fridge. Was a bit crowded when I was there.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

This is the original and can't be beat. If you have been up 395 and gone through Bishop you probably know about it. If you have passed and haven't stopped, then its a must! Nothing like the cheese bread. And if its lunch time get the turkey sandy!<//review>

Amazing & delicious selection of baked goods, fresh sandwiches & freshly squeezed orange juice.   Staff is friendly, helpful & knowledgeable. Very reasonable priced.  Decor is fun & tastefully done.  If you've never stopped in, it's a must...pick up a small treat for yourself or delicious treat/gift for someone else<//Review>

Whenever I meander even remotely close to Bishop I make it a pilgrimage to do by Erick Schat's bakery and grab a few goodies to take back with me. Their bread loafs are stupendous as are the many many deserts that are displayed tempting you to take a many as your hands can hold.

You can't go wrong with any choice but I'm a huge fan of the pull away almond bread.</text>

BEST BAKERY EVER! They have so many options that are great. The line for the place is incredibly long though, due to COVID rules. But before they had the 15-person max capacity, it was really nice to go to.</Text>

<text>We went to the bakery on a road trip. Great place to stop and eat some amazing sandwiches and get some amazing looking bread and jams. I would 100% go back again.</text>< Pictures>

Generally underwhelming, except that it is in Bishop, and there isn't a lot else going on in hundreds of miles in either direction.

The bread was good. Energy bread, swiss volkoren is amazing.
Sandwiches were good. Pastries were bomb. Pies looked so good. Turkey chili was solid!

Great stop on a road trip and won’t be too expensive.<//Text>

Pecan pull away is a delight even after traveling a few hundred miles to me. My husband knows how much i love pecan thus this gift from cali. It was perfect amount of pecan all around with a perfect hint of cinnamon. As you can see i took too many bites before actually sharing my piece but i recommend if in cali<//Review>

<Review>I've been to both the Mammoth & Bishop stores, & never seen it so crowded. I wanted to sit down & have one of their nice sandwiches, but they were extremely crowded, so I had to stand in line forever, then wait for my order for quitesome time. The food was excellent as always, but if I wasn't there with friends who wanted their first-time experience, I would have gone somewhere else. My memory has faded, but I thought they has table service at one time, which is clearly gone now.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Look no further for a delicious bakery.  I drive 4.5 hours to this bakery for AMAZING BREAD.  I can't stress enough how holy this food is, that's it's practically blasphemous.  Don't sleep on including this pit stop before your next trip.  I highly recommend the sheepherders bread, bagels, chili chez loaf and the fresh squeezed orange juice.  OMG! YUM!<//text><Time>1608496491803</Time>< gmap_id>

Same wonderful breads, pastries and Dutch goodies to liven up your trip if you're passing through, even better when you are visiting and want to your friends a thank you for having us over gift.

All my family and friends who travel through Bishop stop most trips for us and friends for the last 5 decades.< /Text>

Bread was excellent! Sandwiches and pot pie were very good but a little pricey. Parking was surprisingly adequate. Two stars for having absolutely no control over crowding in the middle of a pandemic. Host your next superspreader event here!< /Text>

<Review>Sandwich was pretty good and they have some really nice fresh products. I gave four stars instead of 5 because the customer service sucks. It is not hard to be polite and attentive and I got ignored at the sandwich ordering counter for 5 min when there were 5 or 6 employees right there! I finally asked who could assist me and they just stared rudely until one finally spoke to me, "what did you want?" Customer service is what could bring this place to 5 stars.< /Review>< pictures>

This place is bigger than their other location in Mammoth. Three times the size and the busiest place in Bishop. You can really go crazy and drop some big bucks on the goodies and eat all day while driving. Pastries or sandwiches and a Frappe or latte. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Chocolates and goodies everywhere. Oh yeah it's all about their bread. Every type you can think of.<//text>

<review>I've been coming here since I was just a toddler, but this was my first visit back for many years. They don't have the chocolate gold coins any more or as many cookies as they used to or as many the cute little wooden shoes everywhere but it's still lovely and fun to visit. The bread is still delicious and the confections as well. It was so lovely returning with my own family and my sweet little girl, the same age I first started coming!</review><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e</Gmap_id>< name>

<review>I have been going to this place for almost 10yrs now and I just adore it. It reminds me of the bakeries I saw in Europe; it feels welcoming and quaint too. I ALWAYS buy the olive focaccia bread, the chocolate cream cheese Danish, and a raspberry tart. All three, highly recommended. If it is your first time here though, I would say to also get the pull apart monkey bread, apple if they have it. The best time to come? Christmas! They decorate for it and Bishop is picturesque with the snowy mountains as a beautiful backdrop.

Or don't go...then I dont have to worry about the pastries running out when I visit.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

We were rather disappointed in the overall
quality of the baked goods.  Both the "sheepherder" bread and the raisin bread had a slightly burned flavor, the cherry strudel had a cherry flavored pie filling, but not single cherry!  We had a number of additional  purchases, nothing actually bad, just ordinary.</Text>

If you don't stop here for baked goods, coffee,  delicious sandwiches, candies and more ..... you're definitely missing out ! The pot pies are dangerously delicious and they also make everything in house. Fresh, fresh, fresh !!!  😋 It gets really busy during the summer, especially now during these times. Just wear a mask and be polite. Tip the staff, they work hard !<//Review>

Highly overrated by city slickers that travel through. Extremely disorganized operation from start to finish. Usually long lines and wait time.

Has a decent selection of baked goods; not too impressed with the over quality. Coffee is subpar. Cinnamon rolls were below average (didn't offer classic cinnamon roll).

Park across the street and walk over. Their parking lot is a mess. The bathrooms were a disaster.<//Review>

This is our official family road trip stop! This is carb heaven! Delicious, all natural, breads, sweets, and, treats. We always get a sandwich (don't forget to order your cheese). For snack, I LOVE their cheese and garlic breads slices. (The cheese is thick and the garlic spicy-fresh). All the different bread loaves are delicious. The kids love the strudels, doughnuts, cookies, etc. Still haven't tried their gelato, yet... In short, the options are overwhelming, which is one reason why this place is so amazing. To not stop here would be one your biggest regrets in life. Before you pay for your kids to go to college, GO TO ERICK SCHAT'S BAKERY!!! Thrice.</text>

Delicious! If you are passing through Bishop, be sure to stop here. Grab a sweet baked treat or lunch for the road. If you are traveling with children, grab a sandwich from here and head to the park across the street for a road trip break.<//Text>

With that said, their $3 Hot Pastrami Sandwich is so good.</Text>< pics>

I'm the fat girl lol!! We love the bacon chili cheese bread it's so awesome by itself or used for a sandwich. They have only a few dutch specialties some imported like the hopjes candies (definitely grab a bag if you are into coffe flavored goodies) But they have something for everyone, sandwiches, cookies, breads like doughnuts and cinnamon rolls.. Hispanic goodies like churros as well. Grab a coffee or a fresh squeezed juice on the way out! Plenty of photo opportunities as well.

Try to make it when they open as you'll have a better selection of products! Always yummy, and worth a trip! Can not go wrong on anything you buy, my personal favorite is their cream cheese coffee cake cake!</Review>

<review>Every time we're passing by Bishop we stopped at Eric's Shats or Aaron Shats restaurant.

Why?
because we can understand all the ingredients in the food.just plain old regular ingredients no weird aftermarket preservatives or other junk.<//review>< time>

Wonderland! This is my favorite stop while driving on highway CA 395. It's a treat to the eyes to walk around inside the bakery. So many quality products, you name it. Feels like walking through a historic place. The sandwiches are delicious. The breads are outstanding. I always order my favorite chilly cheese bread for savouring once I am home..
It will be bit crowded on long weekends but still I never mind waiting 10-15 minutes in line.. it is at the heart of the city.</Text>

Schat's bakery is a mainstay for anyone heading to Mammoth or Yosemite. Delicious fresh baked bread, great sandwiches and amazing pastries. We went during COVID and the line is incredibly long to get in during lunch hour, but it's well worth it!</text>

Great bakery with good bread, pastries, and sandwiches. They also stock a wide variety of jams and oils. The shop can be a bit crowded between the narrow isles and all the people, so if you have a backpack on be sure to watch where you're walking. I tried the Mule Kick and Hot Pastrami sandwiches and thought they were both really good - tasty, and a generous portion for the price. There's also a vegetarian option for people who want that.</Text>

This place is awesome! Fun stop! Provides a hint at old ways and feels of bread making. Tidbits of historical info/stuff throughout. Some items are not the best you'll ever taste but, are also not full of lab experiments for flavor, color, and preservation either. There are so many items that are a delight that meet the mood of our palate each time we stop. The place has changed a little over time but, still offers a great variety of baked/bakery items and sweets. Each time we stop it's great because they provide us with good options for meals for camping, backpacking, and easily assembled road trip meals on-the-go. Thank you Schat's!</Review>

This place is very crowded every time I go, but for good reason... everything I've tried so far is amazing! The bacon cheese bread is to die for!! Also, there is a deli in the back where you can get a great sandwich.</Review>

<Text>I can't eat sweets because it makes me break out like a teenager BUT Erick Schat's Bakery also has a deli that makes AMAZING turkey sandwiches. The turkey is fresh roasted, not cold nitrite filled cold cuts.

Parking is free but a bit stressful as this place is very popular with tourists.<//Text><user_id>116762086867732256619< /user_id>< time>

You're probably not going here just for the bakery. You're on your way somewhere else. Then you see Erick Schat's Bakery, or you've heard of it, anyway - there's a line of cars. The parking lot is crowded. The licence plates show visitors from multiple states. You decide to go in.

Heavenly smells of baked goods, fresh breads, cocoa and coffee, and a sight to behold - more flavours and types of bread than you've ever seen. All fresh, all delicious, all immediately making you crave the carby goodness.

No matter if you're here for sandwich bread, moist cakes, cheesy breadsticks or an arrangement of baked goods - you'll leave the store happy with hands full of their products. And you'll love every single thing.<//Review>

I am not a bakery freak because usually I'm not overly impressed. But this place....it's all about texture. Awesome chewy crust on the bread. Crisp on the cookies. Chewy perfect texture on the pecan loaf. Why do I know this? Samples. And...the espresso was great.<//Review>

The food is incredible but it's confusing. There is little direction and staff not readily available to ask clarifying questions. You can't just get a pastry and a coffee .... Go here go there....what in the world.  Worth it? Yes. Yum. Just be ready.</Review>

Ana the cashier, rude as hell. I was hoping to have gelato and asked for a chocolate dipped cone. She rudely interrupted my order and just said" yeah I dont have, is that it?". Never coming back,  we drove six hours for this.</text>

<Review>Amazing baked goods, sadly no gluten free options, though they do have multiple types of sourdough for gluten intolerant customers. The deli is open for lunch and they have some premade sandwiches available if the deli is already closed.

<text>My husband has been coming here since he was a kid. So he told me we had to stop on our way up to Yosemite. We all couldn’t wait! We picked up everything we could possibly need. While my husband was checking out my two daughters and I stood to the side to wait and we were greeted with a warm welcome by the owner himself. He then let my daughters pick out some cookies. What a wonderful experience, one that we will always remember. We can’t wait to stop by next time we are passing by!</text>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Always the place to stop, both coming to Mammoth Mountain and going home from Mammoth Mountain. The bakery is filled with breads, cookies, pastries, donuts, and candy. The deli features sandwiches, bread by the loaf, sauces and jams. There is always a line in both sections of the bakery. Outside features some photo opportunity places featuring a wood bear as selfie site and an old time delivery van. The staff is a bit abrupt, but who wouldn't be with tourists coming in all day, probably asking the same questions. The Erick's Schat's Bakery in Mammoth is nice too, but just does not have as much as the one in Bishop. Stop at this one for your eating enjoyment supplies.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Delicious monkey bread and good sandwiches! But it's impossible to get coffee here. You have to wait in the pastry line that wraps around the entire room before you can get to the coffee bar at the end. They should change this setup.<//Review>

Wow that was probably some of the best bread I have ever had. More kinds then I could have ever imagined. It is definitely a huge hotspot so watch cause this place is packed shoulder to shoulder, but that just first to show how good it is. I got the energy loaf and my only regret is not getting two bags.<//Text>

Delicious coffee and pastrami sandwich. A must stop place in Bishop if you're ever in the area. Need to try pastries and their signature bread next time.</Text>

What's not to like about this place? Baked goods are plentiful and variety is over the top. The only bummer is the parking and crowds when you are on your way thru town and have a deadline and so you skip going in. They need a bigger store or second store. We did enjoy the wine store and goodies next door and we were the only ones in there.<//review>

<Text>Loved visiting this bakery. So many choices for breads, pastries, cookies, you name it. There's a sandwich shop in back. Everything we saw or sampled was excellent. We tried a breakfast bagel sandwich, fresh latte, iced tea and a couple pastries. All were delicious. And the macaroons are outstanding as well. It's a must do!!</Text>< pictures>

The BBQ turkey sandwich is also a must experience item here.

Socially distanced line waiting to get in to Schat's bakery was short at 2:00p.m....

I made a shopping wish list from the online menu.  ALL items were available!!

It was a little difficult to maneuver around other humans on the left side of the establishment.</Review>

Oh how I want to go back! I stopped in as a favor for a friend, but didn't realize how enticing everything is! I counted over a dozen different kinds of sourdough and I'm sure I could've counted more! The jerky was AMAZING!!! Definitely going back when time allows!< /Text>

This was my first time here and I love this place. The sandwiches are excellent and the bread is fantastic. One bit of advice: bring your wallet. There is so much here you will want to sample. I got a turkey club on sourdough bread and it was great. Also couldn't resist the beef jerky which I am kicking myself for not buying more. We also purchase a loaf of sourdough bread and banana bread. This is a stop I will make when I make the annual trek to visit my in-laws I from southern California to Reno, Nevada</text>

<Text>You cannot leave Bishop without eating at Schat's Bakery.
This is a bakery like no other, a tourist attraction and lunch place and sensory delight. They do not allow photos inside so getting one is hard.
There is plenty of free parking off street, and the bakery is easy to find on Main Street. I enjoyed the gelato very much.
Honey and jams and jellies are sold, but not made onsite. I was surprised to see Jams from Maine. I tried to buy local honey and ended up with some made by bees in Independence, 45 miles away.
If you are not hungry when you pull up, don't worry. Go inside anyway and stroll through the narrow walkways between racks piled high with good things, look at the array of bakery treats and smell the air. After a short time, you'll wanting to taste more than just the plentiful samples. Get in line...eat inside or out on the sidewalk.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Great Bakery ! My family have been coming to Schat's Bishop for over 50 years. We have made this place a tradition while driving back from Mammoth and Lake Tahoe to LA. The turkey sandwiches are carved right in front you and delicious ! All the freshly made breads are fantastic. My favorite are the Raisin breads and cheese breads right from the oven early in the morning. Also, the pastries and cookies are great !< /Text>

The greatest bread and pastries on the planet. If you park across the street and use the crosswalk, it will save a lot of car-ache. You need to try their roast beef and sprout sandwiches and the banana nut bread. They are incredibly famous for everything they make. You will never be disappointed.</Review>

All around lots of great tastes but removing a star because it is very very touristy. A local joke when explaining where Bishop is is that it's the bakery and gas station just before mammoth.< /Review>

Wonderfully kind staff! They're always stocked on bread and sweets, and it's really easy to navigate. And if you're hungry, they have a sandwich bar where you can put together your own turkey sandwich. I live two hours away and my honey and I go here regularly!< /text>

A must stop to shop place for anyone who loves bread and sweet baked goods.
Its6 a bakery and cafe. VERY busy on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Even weekdays can be busy.
The rule in our family is, if you go by there, you must stop and shop for everyone!! It's  all yummy.
We do stop with grandkids and it takes forever for them to make up their minds, too much good stuff.
Parking around back, but can be very tight for large pickup trucks and small motorhomes.</Review>

Cheese bread was great.  But the access to good bread is starting  to be outweighed by the tourist trap feel.  If you can accept the chaos of the mob, enjoy.< /Review>

I forgot the real name but it has raisins, oatmeal, nuts, apricots, seeds and other ingredients.   Very dense and moist.  The cream filled doughnut was delicious and the cream filling just a little sweet which is perfect.  The raspberry tart had plenty of large raspberries and a nice custard filling but the shell was not very good, a little burnt.  An almond or shortbread shell would have been better.</Review>< user_name>

Great bakery with 2 locations. The one in Mammoth is the standard bakery with sandwich shop the one in Bishop is larger with an added gelato stand. Both have a pet friendly patio. Expect lots of people on holiday weekends. Great breads and the sandwiches are large enough to share. The Chili-Cheese bread is a must try!<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>All the wonderful treats and bread in the world! Carbs galore!! I always purchase the veggie sandwich with smoked Gouda , it's such a large sandwich ,  I eat it for two meals. The ham and cheese croissant is delicious too according to the spouse , go early for that. The staff is very friendly too , no matter how long you take to decide on the treats!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>Super busy when we went during lunch. We ordered turkey sandwiches that were very good! The bread was delicious, especially the crust. Cookies and pickles came with the sandwiches. And we got Mexican cokes to drink. Really great food, dealing with the crowds not so great. But crowded for a reason, haha. Would go back!< /Text><resp>None< /resp></record>

Always packed, but the quality of the baked goods is beyond just a tourist trap, and it is definitely worth the visit for the pull apart buns alone.

The only thing that marred the experience was the barista refusing to make a coffee in a reusable mug for the customer ahead of us in line, basically saying, "We'll make it in a disposable cup then you can pour it in your own mug," which totally defeats the purpose of trying to save resources. It seemed the employee was just following policy, so management really needs to rethink their responsibility to the planet, when there are other coffee shops out there who give *discounts* for bringing your own mug.<//review>

Superb! The picture doesn’t do it justice, but the crispy donught with chocolate is fenomenal. Make sure to plan some time here - the choice is ginormous so it might take a while to make a decision ;)<//Review>

We always stop here when we travel through town. The bread is amazing and the pastries are delightful. Only giving 4 stars because the past few times we've visited, customer service has been lacking.<//Text>

The place is hopping at lunchtime, so break up your road trip, have lunch and buy some homemade bread to go.  You'll probably want to stop there again on your return trip home.<//Review>< Resp>

< Review>
Great service. I chose a Turkey pot pie off the shelf because the line was long. It was filling and I was hungry. A little too much crust for me but it went down just fine.
This was my second trip there and when it's busy it's really chaotic. Anyone with anxiety issues should probably avoid the lunch rush.
I'll be back!<//Review>

What can I say, its like being a kid in a candy store. They have all kinds of cookies, cakes, breads, donuts and sweets. They also have a great selection of sandwiches made fresh right in front of you, and they are relatively inexpensive as well. Great place for one, two or a family to stop in for a treat.<//Review>

<Text>Oh my goodness it's bread heaven! We stopped in on fourth of July weekend and there was easy a hundred people in there buying bread, getting sandwiches etc. There was rack after rack of fresh baked goods, some still warm from the oven at mid day. Despite the crowd the line went fast. The employees obviously had things down pat. I bought two sheepherders loaves and one sourdough for my freezer. This was the first time we'd stopped when traveling the 395 but definitely won't be the last! Not much parking though so plan on being dropped off and picked up.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

It is for sure the best Schatz bakery (when it comes to their bread) that I have been to. Parking is difficult but doable and always very crowded. I am born German and always have a craving for european style bread. It is just not quite up to the level of some local stuff you can get in Germany.<//Text>

Wow! I grew up in a Dutch-American family in Wisconsin, so finding this bakery in the middle of California was a huge treat!! They had olie bollen, Dutch donuts you must try if you never have before. I was so psyched. They have tons of other pastries and breads, and sell sandwiches if you get there in early afternoon. They also sell an assortment of Dutch knick knacks, different delft pottery, and even Wilhelmina peppermints! I had such fun sharing some of my heritage with my friends who were with me.<//review>

<text>I'd give it 5 stars were it not over priced and so touristy (so say this out-of-towner.) They have amazing pastries for just about any taste. They have great sandwiches. One can put on 5 pounds just walking around the tight quarters. I would good here every time I was in town, despite the high prices.< /text>< Pics>

Really good pastries and bread. It’s always crowded and the orange juice is pricey but it’s the best I’ve ever had. They also have a deli and gelato. I personally recommend their danishes and their butter cookies. Their homemade truffles are good too. I like to park across the street and grab the goodies and cross back over to eat at the park. This is always a stop for us driving along the 395 and we’ll always go<//Review>

Huge and delicious sandwiches for cheap. The breads and the meats are so good. If you are in the area, please stop here for a meal and a chili cheese bread loaf to take home. Parking and finding a table can be a pain, though. It's worth it</Review>

< Review>
In my opinion Schat'a is Bar none the very best Bakery in the world. When I was just a kid I had an uncle who lived in Bishop when we would visit we would stop at the bakery. The aromas and exquisite tastes of the pastries mouth watering pastries.  Schats is a class and a league of its own.  Do yourself a favor when you are in the area stop in have a cup of coffee and enjoy world class pastries and bakery items.  Enjoy! I hope you will share your experience with me if you stop in.<//Review>

Even better, get your sandwiches to go. Drive or walk cross the street all the way back to the park, it's got shade and water.  Peaceful</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Nice place but extremely hyped up. Generally if a store is so hyped up that causes a traffic jam in the street has to think of a bigger parking lot.
Prices are really high. I can guarantee that the store has absolutely no local customers.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Been going here for 45 years. Always stop on way fishing and on way back. Dishes and pastries bring back a touch of home. Gets crowded with parking so park across street in park. Lot easier to get in and out. Olie ballen with powder sugar is great. The lunch sandwiches are thick and well worth the price.< /review>< Pics>

Great bakery, all of the employees were incredibly nice. All of the pastries are individually wrapped to ensure cleaniness which is good. And they got a A+ from the health board so :)
They have the option to pick up pre made sandwiches or you can get a fresh sandwich made in minutes.
It's also great to see that they make some of the bread right in front of you.< /Text>

As a kid, every year on our way up to Mammoth, my mom, brother, and I would stop here.  We would get big loaves of cheese, garlic cheese, and chile cheese bread, and snack all the way.  Since, I have shared Schat's delicious baked goods with my husband and daughter by ordering it to be delivered to the East Bay.  We love Schat's!<//text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>I can't not give 5 stars to this classic stop on the 395.  We always stop on the way up to Mammoth or June and pick up a loaf of the original sheepherders bread and a sandwich.  A great thing they do is put the ingredients clearly on the labels so you know exactly what's in it.  This works out well for us since we're vegan.  The bakery also has a sandwich shop with a variety of sandwiches available, including a veggie one you can get without cheese and mayo.  Sandwiches come with a cookie and a pickle.< /text><userid>113078983744308700316< /userid><rate>5<//rate><time>1566424868281</time><Gmap_id>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e</Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

So many kind of baked good and so tasty too. Place is very packed but the check out line is moving. The sour dough is better than in San Francisco. The Bishop is better and more choice than Mammoth so buy you bread and goody here before you go Mammoth.< /Text>

Bread galore. Different types of bread for all your special needs. Pastries so beautifully displayed and so easy going in my mouth... YUMMY.

This detour heading home from Lake Tahoe was definitely worth my derailed diet.

- Whole Pastrami Sandwich on rye bread (not toasted - I think you can request to toast the bread, but from what I have seen they don't do it, unless asked) SO DAMN GOOD I ATE THE WHOLE THING. Hello love handles!

- Veggie Sandwich - instead of Gouda Cheese we got cheddar cheese. That was just as delicious.

- Pastries: Fruit Tart and rasberry type bread (whatever you get I am sure you will be happy). I also bought some danishes for my office. They seemed to love them as well.

Warning: This place gets crowded. So be patient, it's worth it.<//Text>

<text>Great breads, pastries, and sandwiches. It's usually pretty crowded when I've been there, but they keep things moving. They roast turkeys to use for the sandwiches! They do have separate lines for things, so expect that or send multiple people in to stand in different lines. Take some sheepherders bread and a pull-apart for the road.<//text>< Pics>

Stopped by the bakery on the way home to buy some sweets for a gift.  I had 10 items to purchase.  I changed my mind on 1 item, after it was already rung up but not paid for yet.  The girl at the register was so put out that she picked up the item and proceeded to throw it, yes throw, back onto the counter.  The whole time, she never said a word to me. This poor girl seemed to hate her job soo much...or maybe she just hated me! Either way, I think it is time for her to move on.  Life is too short to be miserable.  It's unfortunate since I love this place.  1 bad Apple can ruin everything.</Review>

Lovely and amazing food stop before Mammoth! It has a massive selection of breads and pastries that exceed the average imagination. My husband and his friends each buy a cheese bread to take up to the mountain on ski days. It’s a mood setter.< /review>

There are too many good things to mention everything... BBQ turkey n avocado on a cheese roll. Hopjes- coffee candies, Delft blue kitchenware and knicknacks, fresh chocolate, Dutch pastries, fresh bread- onion is the best! Local fresh honey, coffee cake ...♥️🇳🇱🇺🇸♥️< /text>

<review>Great bakery. This place has turned into quite a tourist attraction and sometimes there are lines and nowhere to park. I was there this morning at 6 a.m., fresh bread was just coming out of the ovens. The place smelled wonderful. There is a huge selection of both pastries and great Artisan type breads.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Yummy! I live in San Diego and I always stop at this bakery when I’m in the Eastern Sierra’s. I stock up on breads and buy some as gifts. Lots to sample. We usually get lunch in the deli (back of bakery) and eat at the park across the street.< /review>< Pics>

Hubby got the sheepherder bread and a big cream puff, and said both were really good. His only complaint was the lack of pricing on the various products. Their sandwiches are really generously sized, and the selection was excellent. Worth a visit if you are here. They need keto choices lol<//text>

Do not miss this chance to stop at one of the best bakeries in California!

They have everything, and more, all of it fresh, delicious and you can tell the care put into every batch. I've been coming here for 10+ years, and if anything the quality has only improved. Stop by the back of the store for excellent deli sandwiches too.</Review>

If you're driving through the little town of Bishop California, this is a must stop bakery. It has got to be one of the best bakeries anywhere. When I am driving to southern California from my home in Idaho, I always stop here. They make fabulous sandwiches at a deli counter that also our work having.< /text>

A Bishop landmark! This place is amazing. A must stop on your way to Mammoth and June Lake. Bacon Chili cheese bread is my favorite. Everyone loved it and ended up buying their own on the way home. Pastries are great, not to mention made to order sandwiches. Prices are fair also.< /review>

Come here! We recently took a road trip to Tahoe from San Diego. 9 hours on the road starting on a light breakfast. We entered Bishop with an appetite like no other and stopped at Erick Schat's Bakery to grab a sandwich. I ordered the Sheepherders Bread Ham sandwich. Amazing! Filling and light at the same time. The ham was juicy and pleasantly not tasting of preservatives. The word on the street was they use fresh cuts of meat. Let me tell you, you can taste the difference and its a difference you will continue to want after you finish your sandwich. The green leaf lettuce was crunchy, the tomato juicy, the deli mustard 👍 on point! The Sheepherders bread slices were exactly like I wanted. Typically I order sourdough so I enjoy thicker, full bread. The Sheepherders bread was everyrhing I wanted.
Come to Erick Schat's Bakery and order a sandwich. You will enjoy every bite. Then head across the street to enjoy it in the cool shade on the grass among the trees. After you're done, do yourself a favor and order another to go, because in an hour you will be wishing you had another!< /text>

Outstanding, delectable food choices. A little high priced, but it is California after all. The fresh OJ is great, but get ready to open your wallet!</Text>

A "must stop", everytime we're on the 395. Love everything in here! We had some wonderful deli s as sandwiches,  that served as 2 meals for a few in our group. And we leave empty- handed, so  we grabbed some pecan pull bread for our breakfast thr next day. That bread was amazing,  but of course everything is. Baked fresh daily , wonderful flavored breads, kinda makes you scratch your head on what to buy. Lots of choices. Take your time and read about the wonderful history, also. We'll be back by on our next trip!</Text>

I did take off one star for lack of customer service in the pastry department. I would have liked to pick some treats but the woman was not in a likely mood. I enjoyed my trip very much.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Wow!!!!!!  IF you are in Bishop, Ca and you dont stop and shop at this bakery, you are crazy.  Weekends are difficult, because the place is packed.  Early is best.  They open at 6am.  EVERYTHING is great, including their sandwiches.  I REALLY like the apple fritters and their nut breads.< /Text>< Pictures>

This is the most amazing and legendary bakery I have ever been too, it’s very crowded but that’s fine, all the products you get here will be worth the wait. Fresh and fun breads, pastries, sandwiches are available at the ready.< /review>

This was my first time here and it won’t be my last definitely worth the stop I recommend if you get something don’t just get one of it because it’s so good it won’t last. Shepherd bread is the best the blueberry pound cake is supper delicious but my all time favorite was the cranberry muffin I wish I got more of.< /Text>

Awesome sandwich and cookie. One request is to let people know the complimentary cookies have peanut if they do. As a person with an allergy it was hard to know and ended up having to take Benadryl ❤️< /Review>

Generally underwhelming, except that it is in Bishop, and there isn't a lot else going on.  Good bread.  Good pastries.  Yummy sandwiches. In fact, best in 200 miles in any direction.  But if it was in a major city it would not blow your mind.   Then, it wouldn't break your budget either.  Get the bread pudding.<//review>

<Review>I have been coming here for many years. The service is always top notch and the product is always fresh. The sandwich bar is great and they put it together right in front of you subway style. We make it a point to stop here for our yearly camping trip just for their Bacon, Cheese and Chili bread.< /Review>< pics>

This is a great place for award winning fresh baked bread.  Drop by early in the day for better selections.  Many popular breads run out by the end of the day.  This is a recommended stop if you are passing through Bishop.< /Review>

This place is overwhelming in an amazing way! There are sooo many delicious options. My boyfriend used to stop at this bakery with his family on the way to and from Mammoth. Safe to say we will be making that a tradition as well.

This trip we bought 2 original cheeze breads, a garlic cheeze bread, macaroons, and the apricot coffee cake. The coffee cake is addicting!

Tip: If you are not a huge bread person (or you want your bread to last), Cut your bread into 2-4 pieces and freeze it. Then you can defrost as you please over the course of 3 months or so.

Eating a macaroon as I write this....<//review>

I got a turkey sandwich and it was delightful! I highly recommend this place. The staff are nice, it's really busy, and had a positive atmosphere. The baked goods are also really good. I bought some sour dough bread to take home to my family. The bread was super good. If I'm in the area I'll definitely come back.</text>

Beautiful delicious bakery. The very best best cheese danish we have EVER had. Great coffee. We missed the sandwich counter, but will try it on our next trip. The staff was very helpful. If you find yourself in Bishop California this is must on your way!!! Everything we had was well worth the trade for a few dollars for.<//text>

<Text>One of the better bakeries in the Eastern Sierras. Bread offerings are really good. We always visit Schats a couple of times when visiting the area. Lots of bake goods to choose from. Generally is crowded. Bishop location is always crowded.< /Text><user_id>106089869085324845288</user_id>< name>

This is a large bakery and sweet shop, with loaves of bread (savory and sweet), donuts, gelato, and pastries. There's room to eat inside or outside. The parking is free and plentiful. The employees were polite and professional. The place was clearly patronized by locals (not just tourists). I got a pecan roll and a raspberry cream cheese croissant. Both were good, very tasty and not overly sweet. But neither were amazing. The pecan roll was a little too crusty. I also had a jack cheese roll. It was a bit dry and could have used more flavor.<//Review>

Their lunch counter is terrific. Be advised that a full sandwich is enough for two adults.  The soups were a turkey chili and turkey vegetable soup. The sandwiches and soups get a two thumbs up!
Don't forget the bakery their breakfast pastries and donuts are memorable!
Also, plan on buying breads which are baked fresh everyday and the flavor choices are extensive in the breads.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>It’s a cool spot to enjoy a hot drink (coffee, tea, or hot coco) with a pastry. There’s indoor and outdoor seating. I recommend the Mexican tea cookies and the buttermilk donut stuffed with chocolate. Of course, there’s a variety of fresh loafs of bread, jams, and oils.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Stop by for a filling sandwich or come by just for some pastries. Have a good selection of breads and cakes, cookies and candies. If driving by mammoth, make this one of your stops along the way.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

If you are heading to Bishop California, then add Schat's Bakery to you "Must Do ", list. I suggest saving room for lunch as their sandwiches are made with roasted turkey carved right off of the bird and amazingly fresh baked bread. They have all types of meats, but the turkey is truly outstanding. Then for desert grab a loaf (or two because you will want more, trust me), of Cinnamon pull-apart bread and  some of there butter cookies and enjoy carb heaven. For an added treat pick up a bag of day old bread and walk across the street to the Visitors Center. The park is peaceful as well as beautiful, with plenty of picnic tables under shade trees and a little creek with hungry ducks.  A great way to decompress from the road and recharge your batteries. Oh,  on a side note if you like a little spice in your life the pepper cheese bread is yummy as well!</review>

Go for the best cheese pockets. If I haven't been there & cleaned them out you'll be lucky to get 1 or 2. Oh, the bread is world famous also. Tri tip sandwich? I could go on & on.<//Review>

We always stop here when we go through Baker. A family tradition. This last time we were driving back from Tahoe to SoCal.

We got Butter Cookies, 2 buckets, a Mushroom Focaccia, sandwiches, and cream cheese cookies. All were delicious and the Focaccia was to die for, all loved it but my 8 year old who hates mushrooms.</review>

<text>I had heard about this place for years & never had the chance to try it. We bought 2 loaves of bread, a couple of coffee cakes and sandwiches. The sandwiches were well made, the meat was tender and juicy and flavorful. The bread had a nice toothyness. The other items we bought have been excellent. If you're going to Mammoth or Reno it's well worth the stop.</text><Rate>4</Rate></record>

<user_id>104642218894554685753<//user_id><text>Having read all the hype, my wife and I stopped by Schat's Bakery on a recent trip through Bishop, and bought some chocolate chip cookies. The employee who "helped" us was rude and confrontational, much like the Soup Nazi on "Seinfeld", except not funny. The cookies were a flavorless masonite-like substance and we only ate a few and threw the rest away. On our next trip through Bishop we tried Great Basin Bakery on Main Street. The people who work there were very friendly and helpful, and the cookies were delicious. Schat's?

<review>I love this place!!! It smells amazing as soon as you open the door!! (I imagine this is how heaven smells) one side of the store is fresh bread and the other is pastries. Way too much stuff for just one trip. They even have shipping available if you want something sent.< /review><Date>1537416797239< /Date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great bakery in Bishop, stopped along the way to South Lake Tahoe. Prices are high, but there are 1/2 priced items in the back near the restrooms. Super tasty everything I've purchased here. Raspberry pastry, cream cheese coffee cake, and the bread.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Extremely touristy, very busy and super packed with breads everywhere. If a place that serves food is packed with people and food everywhere, I personally feel that it is somewhat unhealthy ! The flavors may be great but not worth my while to wait in line feeling like someone may knock you down or you may knock down that cart of breads , if you aren't careful !<//Review>

Its a great place to check out, if you don't mind the herds of people with the same idea! That's how wonderful this place is. The yummy selections of breads and pastries and treats of every kind delights and welcomes you as soon as you walk through the door. Their bread is made fresh daily.  You can also enjoy some lunch there at there deli.  I will admit It's a bit pricey, but worth a one time splurge at least. Don't forget to look around at the wonderful and beautiful personality of the place . Very Family friendly. Absolutely will enjoy!< /Text>

Samples of the pull-away bread were delicious but overall pretty disappointing experience. Cinnamon buns and ice cream were very underwhelming and certainly overpriced. I don’t particularly recommend this stop.<//text>

<text>Busy and fun deli & bakery shop. Quite expensive. The sandwiches are great, not many veggie options, but plenty for the meat eaters. The cakes are good too (recommend the cinnamon buns). The coffee isn't great.. Limited seating, but nice outside in the sunshine (we were there early January).</text><name>Nicola</name><userid>116566396970350032975<//userid>< time>

<text>They're pastries and bakery stuff def 5 stars, IT'S ALWAYS SO MOIST AND FLUFFYYY! I can see why the lines are insane for them. I came here before for just their baked goods, but came back for lunch when we were passing by on our way to our campground in Inyo National Park.

This review adds in their entree meals. To be perfectly honest, it was very underwhelming. It felt like mediocre Thanksgiving leftovers... I ordered their turkey drumstick platter (comes with mashed potatoes and boiled vegetables). The turkey leg was in this not very appetizing brown goop and the vegetables was just (literally) water boiled carrots, green beans and some other veggies. It was very basic items that didn't have a lot of flavor to it and was not very impressive. Definitely not worth the wait in my opinion. 2 stars at best for the nice ladies that prep all these meals for the huge line everyday.< /text><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Where else can you find a REAL turkey sandwich at a restaurant? We're not talking the mystery slices you find at most places -- this is fresh off a roasted turkey. Their veggie sandwich is also the best we've ever been served. The huge selection of homemade breads is outstanding and the vast assortment of pastries and other treats will make your mouth water. Whenever we're within driving distance of Bishop, we make a point to stop off at Schat's.< /Review>

Wow. The bread is delicious. Chili cheese Jalapeno heated up is the bomb. I purchased this bread while visiting Mammoth, and was recommended while I was on a local shuttle bus with the locals. They know their stuff.<//Text>

Largest bakery  I  ever saw.  They  have lots of different kinds of breads, cake,candy. In side  you can also find  a nice  lunch  place.  Always  fresh lunch,  salad, fruit cake coffee,  tea.  In side view is very good.  Out side  view is also  nice with  out door table to sit down and have fun. Looking forward to go again.</Review>

It's a fun place, but can be crazy during the day.  Somewhat of a tourist trap, but still worth the visit.  Highly recommend waking up early to avoid the crowds.

This has always been a 395 road trip stop for me since I was a kid.  Schat's is a fun stop for anything bread or sweets related, but there are better options in town for sandwiches (highly recommend Mahogany Meats) and for coffee (highly recommend Looney Bean coffee).

They used to have an awesome onion cheese bread, but they dropped it from the menu to make way for the bacon cheese bread, which is just meh.  Also, there used to be about 2x or 3x the amount of cheese in those breads long ago, in the 2000s.  Nowadays there is a really disappointing amount (this isn't a one-time judgement, it's something I have noticed in my last five or so visits recently).

For folks who want to taste what the onion cheese was like, or want a more generous helping of cheese, I highly recommend the onion focaccia bread.< /text>

Wish it had just one kind of gluten free item. I totally get that is easier said than done, it just would be nice.
When I could eat gluten, my favorite breads were the volkoren and the sour dough, SO yummy!!!
Their deli is great too so I would give Schat's five stars but I can't eat most of everything they make.< /Text>

I remember this place when I first went 20 years ago and their wonderful cheese bread.

Fast forward to 2018 and is still the same. The smell of baked goods is heavenly and their cheese bread is the favorite of my daughter and me! Their chocolate chip pound cake was eaten by family at dinner and their chocolate chip cookie chased it down.

If you there before lunch I highly recommend their turkey sandwich. Simple but sooooooooooo good.< /text>

<Date>1552411008936< /Date><review>The bread and sandwiches here were great! I ordered the pastrami sandwich. The meat was very tasty and it was a nicely built sandwich. I also bought a bag of chili cheese breadsticks and wish I bought more. The shepherd's bread was also very good. Lines were long but efficient so you don't end up waiting too long. Friendly staff. This is the first time I've been here because usually by the time we finish our day at Mammoth ski resort, this bakery is already closed. But we left midday yesterday and was lucky enough to pass by while it was still open. I would definitely stop by the next time I pass thru when it's open.</review>< pics>

The Best Bakery in these parts, by far.  If you happen to be there at lunch time,  have them make you a Turkey sandwich.   They roast whole turkeys and they are just wonderful.   Try a loaf of Volkoren bread....a dense hearty bread that is delicious toasted.  Don't miss this Bishop gem.</Text>

It would be a CRIME not to stop over at Schatts Bakery Bishop! Best Sourdough bread in California, their deli sandwiches are fantastic, my favorite so far is their pastrami on rye! Stop by for fresh pastry and coffee ! You will not be disappointed!!<//Text>

<Review>A must stop whenever I'm coming thru Bishop, and I try to come up with any excuse to drive the 5 hours over this beautiful area of California!  Where to start?!

Their breads beautifully aromatic and you will not go wrong with any kind that you choose, weather their classic chili cheese bread to their Rosemary Sourdough bread.

If you are coming for lunch or thinking about having delicious to eat for lunch please try their sandwiches! You honestly can't go wrong with any of what they have to offer, including their Thanksgiving dinner sandwich which you can have anytime of the year. For me? hot pastrami all day!

Looking for something to satisfy the sweet tooth? Have a look at the dozens of pastries they have to offer and pick what looks good to you.  Be careful though, you might find yourself picking up more than you bargained for. Is that a bad thing though? Also come to this section during the morning for some delicious breakfast sandwiches!

At the end of the pastry corner are drinks! Need a pick-me-up while you enjoy the drive along the majestic slopes of the Eastern Sierra? Have a coffee! They have so many choices and the drinks definitely compliment well with the pastries you just picked up.  Also, fresh orange juice throughout the day cam definitely help revitalize the body if you are making that road trip on 395.

All times of the year this place is packed! So be ready to spend some quality time here! Now to plan the next time I come back to Owens Valley...< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJmF6VbSNJOlxmEmqNa-w1OPc1WE_1fQBNepIf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I drive about 350 miles to get bread at Erick Schat's Bakery. It's the freshest most delicious bread I've ever had. Great snacks and ice cream too.

We have been stopping here for over 35 years. The selection of their bread is so large that it's unbelievable . But of course they are famous for the sheepherders bread . when traveling through Bishop this place is a must.<//review>

<review>Delicious bread, pastries, and sandwiches.  Note that each section closes at a different time.  The sandwich deli closes the earliest, followed by the bakery, and then the pastry area.  Definitely worth stopping by if you're headed up (or down) the 395.

Personally I recommend their Sourdough, but really all the bread there is absolutely delicious.  The jerky is ok, as are the honey and other accouterments.  The bread, pastries, and sandwiches are where they shine.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Great sandwiches, generous with the meat fillings, unlike Paul's in Carson City. Great prices and great selection. The Pistachio Whispers cookies are my absolute favorite cookies ever. Our number one pit stop when passing through Bishop.</Review>

Small place, big lines but they move fast. One of a kind gem in the middle of downtown Bishop. The sweets are great, but I actually like the bread even better.<//Text>

<text>Historic bakery and cafe, take home breads, and more.

If your in town you can't, and shouldn't, miss it!  Listen to your kids, or your inner kid, and forget the diet, believe me it's world class and worth it.

Once you walk in and see the bounty your going to cave anyway so you might as well forgo the guilt and just enjoy!  Great coffee choices too.<//text><Date>1515171779630< /Date>< GmapID>

Fresh bread of every imaginable kind (picked up Stollen for Christmas, dinner rolls, sourdough and cinnamon raisin) that would be worth the drive in itself. To save time you can pick up a pre-made sandwich near the door. The checkout is very fast. If you have more time, you can wait in the longer line for a custom sandwich, etc. They have seating inside and out. This is a truly iconic place.</Text><rate>5</rate><Date>1545510565486</Date></record></dataset><record>

<text>Our favorite bakery - woildn't miss this stop on our way north for anything! Try the new Lavendar scone - so good with just enough Sweetness. Slow brewed iced coffee is smooth and rich - not too strong or bitter. Also purchased YOGURT CREME POUND CAKE, cinnamon roll, chocolate chip cookies and elephant tax. All yummy.< /text><username>Randee Ferry</username>< gmap_id>

Wonderful selection of fresh breads. Make great gifts for your friends and family back home. Can get very busy on Sunday afternoons with the crowds of Sierra visitors driving through Bishop. Look in the back for "one day fresh" discounted items.<//Text>

Always love going to Shat's. It's been at least 8 years since I've been last, and it's still great. Miss the cheddar jalapeño bread, though, couldn't find any this trip if they still make it.<//Review>

<text>BUYER BEWARE! This is NOT the Schat's Bakery it used to be!  Sold to another person the bread quality has decreased from its former 5 star level! The "Extra Sourdough" bread is AS flavorless and soft as white bread. The "Cinnamon Raisin" bread has holes the size of golf balls (literally). Though still a good tourist stop, it no longer has the high quality baking behind the original Schat's Bakery.  Too bad.
But as a welcome stop in the middle of the western desert? Not bad.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
A classic pit-stop for visitors to Bishop, or those passing through coming from LA and going to Mammoth, Tahoe, or any of the other great outdoor areas along the way.

I personally have been coming here since I was a kid, every time my family passed through Bishop while heading to Tahoe on the 395. Over the years my tastes have evolved, from sugary sweets to more simple breads, and Schat's has always had something to offer.

The breads, pastries, and all their bread products are top-notch. Are they the best in the world? Honest answer: No. Schat's does make an excellent bread, but over the years I have come to realize Schat's is great, but not amazing.

Schat's knows it has a huge appeal and tourist draw, and you can see it reflected in the prices. This is my one major gripes about the place, as the price of their breads and products can be on the high side. My advice is that if you have never had "Schat's" before, go for it and get yourself some bread, and form your own opinion.

I now personally don't stop here everytime I pass through Bishop, as I sometimes opt to just bring bread from a local bakery in my hometown. Whenever I do stop here though, it's always nice to revel in the memory and timelessness of a place that has been here for as long as I've known, and enjoy a nice loaf of bread for the journeys ahead.< /Review>

<text>Good bread, a little overpriced if you pay for the fresh bread. But get that day old bread and you'll be very happy with how much bread you can get for such little money.  It's also a good idea to try their vast variety for an entry fee that way if you find a loaf that you HAVE to buy fresh than it won't be a shot in the dark. A personal favorite is the Volkoren bread.<//text>< Time>

If you're traveling the 395 through Bishop you must stop at Eric Schatts Bakery. Besides the Shepard's White bread they're famous for, the Caraway Rye Bread is the closest I've found to Estonian light rye. The deli sandwiches are outstanding.<//Text>

<review>As advertised, nice place to stop in and carb load. I had the pastrami sandwich which was dynamite.  Got cheese bread to go and it didn't disappoint, their version of shortbread is different then what I'm familiar with but they still "disappeared" quickly. Place is worth the visit but as others stated; crowded, long lines and your paying extra for the novelty.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Get the cheese bread or the chili cheese bread (which has jalapeños and chili peppers). We barely make it home before finishing it.

The cheese breads are so delicious and have become a gift of choice for our daughter's teachers when we pull them out of school to go to Mammoth. Also, if you haven't tried their sandwiches you need to give a try. The mini pizza is one of my favorites along with the turkey leg.<//text>

Too busy...my hot turkey sandwich was literally COLD by the time I could pay at the cashier line. Staff was NOT friendly at all. Tables were dirty and no one was cleaning them. We bought olive oil and bread to go that was yummy, but both cost $27. So not a bargain at all. I guess we just chose an off day to try it for the first and only time. It was PACKED and the parking was a nightmare. I hope you have a better experience because obviously people love this place< /review>

<Text>Busy but the smell of fresh baked bread is heaven, so much more to choose from at the Bishop location compared to the Mammoth location but both are definately worth the stop, we got monkey bread and the original sheepherders bread made a sandwhich right then and there for the ride down 395<//Text></record>

<Review>Schat's is the spot--mountains of bread, comfortable bathrooms, and some world class comestibles! Some of the baked goods I've purchased from Schat's have been mediocre, but enough of them superlative (esp relative to the price) that I feel a rush of elevating neurotransmitters whenever pulling up the the cheery Dutch baker signage. Also, if you are climbing bum (or on a budget), day old items are 50% and older ones are 35¢!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's hard to be a bakery that has dozens of types of breads you've never even heard of. When they say Bakery, they mean it! This place has literally every type of baked good you can imagine, and some that you can't! I went a little bit crazy and bought a bunch of gifts for friends, but let's just say not many of them made it through the road trip home!</review>

Every time I pass through Bishop (and that's many time a year) I stop by Schatt's.  Their turkey sandwiches on their Shepard's bread is the best I've ever had.  You know it's going to be good when you see them taking the turkey off of the actual roasted bird.  My only problem with the place is that it's always busy, but that's a good thing I guess.</review>

<text>The wife would say she loves it, I say it's ok. More of a tradition to stop in Bishop than anything else. Good selection of bread. Pull apart cinnamon is crazy addicting. Wife swears by their turkey sandwiches. The Xmas sandwich is always a safe bet. If you want jams or jellies this place is it. Don't forget about their single item pastries and gelato there as well. I might like their gelato more than anything else to be honest</text>< Time>

<Review>Great food - very busy. I had a hard time getting help at the pastry counter and the racks were very close together.  It was busy, but I've been in when it is busier.   I was here early on a Sunday morning and they were stocking shelves that may have attributed to the lack of assistance.  But, their fresh made sandwiches are well worth stopping for.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e</gmap_id></record>

Maybe if you just stick to the breads that made them famous I suppose, but the cookies and the rest of the pastries are pretty average IMO. It's a cool touristy place to stop, everyone has to see it at least once, but I've been coming through town for 45+ years and I think it's overrated.

<Review>If you love everything gluten this place is for you for sure! Their bread is out of this world and they selection for days. Not to mention they have their own set of dipping oils and vinegar, and then if that wasn't enough they have an entire desert/pastry section. Must stop place if you are in the area.< /Review><Name>Nicholas Child<//Name></record>

< review>
World-wide classic.  I have driven on 395 through Bishop on no less than 30 round trips.  Schat's is my "go to" place to eat and be recharged.  The food is simply amazing.  Fresh.  Delicious.  Filling.  The staff is friendly, despite the large number of customers.  The number of differnt languages spoken by the foreign travelers who stop to eat there is fun to count.  There is a new Deli in town.  I almost went there just to try something new, until I read all of the excellent reviews of the new Deli, which seemed to be written by friends of the new Deli and aimed at stating false information about the competitor Schat's.  I dream of eating at Schat's on my trips from Reno to Southern California - even though I have traveled to and eaten in 49 USA states and 40 countries!< /review>

Wonderful bakery. Only problem was it was crowded (like always, I guess) so it was like a production line getting through there. Little time to peruse various items. The check-out line goes through where individual items are, so you either lose your place if you stop or you pass on items because you feel pressed to move along.< /text>

<Review>This place doesn't need another five star review. But as someone who grew up in the Netherlands it is a absolute gem. They have OllieBollen! Which I have never seen in the U.S. before and yes they are delicious. The creme Puffs and fruit tarts are divine. Don't forget to grab some Stroop Wafflen and yes, the original Sheepherders bread is actually that amazing and you should absolutely buy it. Every time I'm in town this is my go to spot.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e< /gmap_id></record>

We stop here everytime we go thru Bishop, CA. It has great break, a little over priced but it's worth the stop at least once. It has great wacky decor inside and is a very popular place to stop. Don't be discouraged by the line it is worth the wait. Their sourdough bread and any flavor of bread sticks it the best! Can't wait to go back< /Review>

Used to love the place, but seems like they get mobbed more and more and haven't been able to keep up. Showed up mid-week just after lunch and they were already nearly picked clean of cheese bread.

Avoid the busy times and they're excellent, although for sandwiches they do have some stiff competition down the street now...</Text>

There is a reason this place is always so busy. Best bakery around! People come from all over the world for Schat's bakery. Don't miss the sandwiches made to order, fresh breads, cakes, cookies, donuts and gelato. Even their coffee is delicious!</text>

First time going to the bakery. I'm only giving this place 3 stars because of the food. The service deserves a negative rating if possible. Lovely selection of breads, doughnuts, pastries, and many other things. Picked up Oregon Trail Strawberry Jam for my sister in Colorado, it's her favorite! However, it being my first visit I wasn't sure of the way things flowed, such as the line and what register was used for breads and pastries. There was no one around to ask. Wasn't even greeted when we walked in. When I got to the register the cashier was very rude. Her tone of voice and dirty looks because we didn't go through the line correctly was totally uncalled for. She kept starring with confusion the whole time I was checking out and making inappropriate faces. The employees need to be trained in greeting customers and not being rude. Will tell family and friends and not to go to the bakery any longer.<//text>

If you like bread, you must stop here. Every time I pass I have to buy two or four different breads and try at home later, also the sandwich is great. The veggie one I love.< /text>

Well it has been a while since I drove through Bishop. It seems that every trip requires a stop at Schat's. The choices are always so inviting that I find myself overbuying. It is magic to see and smell all the creations at this bakery. Schart's is a institution in Bishop, and is one of the crown jewels of the area.
This is always a must stop for every traveller in the area.
Baked goods, bread, cookies, jerky, sandwiches and more. It is even fun to watch the people be  entertained by the choices in the bakery.
This place is fun for everyone.</review>

Around 4 pm Monday there wasn't much to look at. Free samples though. Banana nut muffin was ok, chocolate croissant was ok. Souvenirs are fairly priced. Bathrooms very clean. Changing table was at the entrance of women's bathroom, a bit awkward but it was clean. I wouldn't stop there again. I'd rather spend my pit stop at jack in the box. I was let down by the customer service, I thought they would be more welcoming and they were a bit jaded.< /text>

European-themed bakery with every type of sweet and savory baked good imaginable. They are famous for their sheepherder bread. A couple weird things about the place: they gave themselves an A+ cleanliness rating and they don't allow photography inside.<//text>

<text>Very cool looking place with a large selection of sandwiches, cookies and breads.They also serve a turkey dinner here at any time of the day. Sandwich was just okay and I got the turkey sandwich made with fresh turkey cooked in the place. Not worth it for how long the line was though.</text><gmapID>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e</gmapID>< name>

<rating>3<//rating><time>1509298934022<//time><text>Large bakery with every imaginable baked item you could want.

Came in late in the day to grab a few items for dessert ... Ordered  four single items from the sweets cabinet.. two truffles,  a pumpkin something, and a chocolate covered macron.  The girl went back to the case for the items, bagged then and we paid.

When we got to our hotel after dinner we opened the bag. No chocolate covered macron.

So the employees are not able to remember any order larger than 3 items..  Make sure you personally watch them load you bag or check it before you walk away.

The truffles were excellent. I have no idea on the macrons......<//text></record></dataset><record>

Place is usually crowded, seems to be a tourist spot. They also sell sandwiches, made to order and some pre packaged sandwiches. Over all its a VERY good place to stop by and grab a quick bite. I only gave it 4 stars cause it was VERY crowded and it took about 30 minutes wait for the sandwiches, but hey good food takes time right? Just wish the place was a tad bigger.

<Time>1468938386237< /Time><review>My brother's family purchased some baked items which was d@mn good.  When you go inside, it's a sensory overload place which you could get "drunk" on the smell :D  So many different things to choose from which a multiple visit is required.  Hopefully I'll be able to visit the place again when I see my brother's family again.  The only downside about visiting the place is that there are signs everywhere that asked patrons not to take pictures inside.  I was planning on taking pictures for memories but I didn't whereas I've seen people ignored the "No photos" request.< /review></record>

I dont know why this place is so crowded... it's a $10 sandwich that is OK. I mean it's good, but it is not 30 minute wait and $10 good.  I had much better subs before for less money and less wait.< /review>

They put out fresh bread every day and it is delicious!! We always grab a couple of loaves on the way up to mammoth to eat for breakfast and after skiing snacks. Then stop again on the way back to bring more home! Fresh baked breads in every flavor and combination imaginable.< /review>

Two words: Cheesy Bread. I have to force myself to not stop and get some every time I drive by.

Shat's is one of those places you have to go! It is an amazing bakery with great pastries and some of the best bread you can buy. On the way to Mammoth, in Bishop, its a great place to stop for lunch to grab a sandwich, cookies, coffee, and/or a loaf or two of bread. The one issue is that they get extremely busy! Try to stop early or late because at lunchtime they fill up making the grab and go sandwiches a far better option.<//Review>

<review>One of the best places on US 395 for Bfst/Lunch/Snack. They have a huge selection of sandwiches, baked goods, and deserts. They have won numerous awards for their sandwiches. Turkey Sandwich and Mule Kick are highly recommended. Their portions are large and usually half sandwich is plenty enough. You get a pickle slice and a cookie with every order of sandwich. Lines are long at all times of the day but the wait is worth it.</review><Pics>None</Pics><user_id>103224863213818624185< /user_id><gmapID>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e</gmapID>< Time>

More hype than good food or service.
- -  always a zoo or madhouse in there with so many tourists trying to see what this place is all about.  Been there multiple times (with different people) will not stop by again, unless the people im with really want.< /text>

< review>
We heard this was a must stop. Its a Dutch bakery that's been around since the 30s.  stopped by on our way up to June lake to get some sheephearder bread ( a Basque favorite) but it was sold out, so we got some chilli cheese bread and it was very good. We also all picked out some pastries and there were no complaints. This will ne a new must stop for us for sure. They have a huge variety of breads and sweet to choose from, and had a nice size deli that made some great looking sandwiches but the line was so long we decided not to wait. The parking situation isn't great but its worth it.<//review>

<review>Be warned, long lines are a trap. So much goodies as you inch closer and closer to the register. If you have little self-control, just plan ahead and stick to what you want to buy, otherwise you may end up buying way more than you expected. Sandwiches are surprisingly filling and really good. Bread is good, this place is bound to have something you will like. Parking can be a little tricky, but they seem to have plenty.< /review><time>1483827567006</time><Rate>5< /Rate><user_name>Larry Y<//user_name>< response>

<Review>Plan ahead this place was packed when we got there.  They make a good sandwich and have a huge selection of breads and pastries.  I gave it 3 stars because of the crowds, lack of parking and the patio is right on main street so get ready to enjoy some serious traffic noise.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Holy marmots of Mt. WHITNEY this is a great bakery. Lots of sweets, yummy sandwiches, and huge fresh bread loaves. It's cramped cuz it's an old stylish building that is SUPER popular. Be perpetrated to be bumped by other bread lovers. Also... free samples!<//review>

The best blueberry croissant on the planet. Other items are equally excellent. Their teriyaki beef jerky is beyond compare. I live 5hrs 50 min from the bakery and its worth the drive. Modesto Junior College students visit every year< /Review>

In fourteen years of living in southern California, one of my favorite things about going through Bishop was stopping at this bakery. I realized if I could live in Bishop, I would probably weigh at least ten pounds more. Really wonderful fresh and flavorful breads among other things. Bishop residents are spoiled with this right at their hands. All I have left from Erick's is my refrigerator magnet as a reminder to something so sublime.< /Text>

Exquisite pastries, confections, breads. One selection was a bacon, chili cheese bread shared with my brother and family tonight-
yummo. Arrive before 5PM and stake your claim to a freshly roasted turkey sandwich.< /text>

This place is a tourist attraction - with really good baked goods and food.  Definitely worth stopping by if you're traveling through Bishop, however, be prepared for a long line and people who don't know how to drive in the parking lot.</Text>

Have been going to Schats Bakery every summer since I was a baby. Family tradition that continues now with my family. I love the breads, the Deli sandwiches are so good. CranMayo is life! And all the yummy treats. We always get the giant cinnamon rolls and fresh OJ before heading up to South Lake. Totally worth it every time<//review>

Best selection during breakfast,  snack-time,  lunch, any other snack-time and dinner.  Just eat all you can,  everything is delicious!

Only frustration is deciding what to put back because you have just overwhelmed yourself with baked goodness.  Raspberry anything is an all-time favorite!<//Review>

It's popular and very crowded but there seemed to be enough parking. It is packed full of bakery items, a crazy huge selection!<//Text>

Very trendy looking place but sandwiches are only ok. Bread tastes ok too. More of a popular visitor place, not a regular place. Their pull away bread seems popular here. Too sweet for people who don't like sweet things.</review>

<Text>They have signs posted throughout the establishment that says you can not take pictures. Now I would love to show the world how awesome this place is however not taking pictures in a socially connected age is a very poor decision. The Bakery and Deli are very unique and the food is excellent. Places like this are extremely rare and are a must visit.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>Easy to find off 395 in Bishop. Freshly made sandwiches to order on the best bread.  premade one's also done daily.  extensive bakery.  Good qiality food.  Busy all of the time.  good amount of parking but sometimes a good place never has enough.  A must stop.  Only drawback is that when it is hot in Bishop, it is hot in Schat's, melting chocolate chip cookies. This was in June 2017.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

They are always super busy so there's no parking space but it's understandable because it is SO GOOD. Can't find sandwiches like these anywhere else. I get that they're super busy but I just wish the staff was a little bit more friendly rather that treating you like a just another tourist they're trying to get out the door.<//Text>

It was okay very busy lots of people almost anything in the world you would want from bakery. I just didn't like the flavor of the Long Johns my kids weren't really thrilled about it either. We just thought it was okay</Review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>I'll admit they do have a cool building and lots of variety, I will never go back. The employees were very rude. My friend dropped her donut right after buying it and they wouldn't even consider replacing it. They also snapped at us for taking a picture, and it took a long time to get service. The tables were dirty, the layout was confusing, and the prices were ridiculous ($5 for a peanut butter cup!?)

I wouldn't recommend.<//review>< response>

I've been coming here for years on my way to Mammoth Mountain. I always get the gingerbread men and the pecan pull-away bread. Great bread and other sweets are available too!< /Review>

The breads are very tasty and fresh.  The other bakery items are "okay" at best.  The service is what drives down my review.  We arrived at the sandwich counter only to be told they were out of all but two breads.  Fine, we opted for one of the choices available, but were then told they were out of cheese as well.  When I went to the other side to order some of their sweeter options, I couldn't get any service.  I finally settled for what I could serve myself on the pre-packaged shelves and checked out.  At the checkout, when asked if this was all I wanted, I explained how I hadn't gotten any service for the behind the counter items.  The cashier (Jose) laughed.  He didn't offer to help me, he didn't apologize for the shoddy service, just laughed.  When I asked him why he was laughing, he laughed more.  This place does not value the individual customer.  Great bread - SCH!Tservice.< /Review>

This place is extremely busy with the lines going around the shop and even out the door. I don't know how they do it but the lines move quickly!

The Sheppard bread is on point and the apple pull apart bread is to die for!< /text>

Been coming here for 60+ years. All products are excellent, especially the chili cheese bread, and now the fairly new bacon chili cheese bread. Pistrami sandwich is a "go to"!</Review>

Hands down My Fav All-time Bakery. Fresh breads are Worth my 4 + hr drive 😊chili bacon cheese bread a Must try 👍🏽🙃 their bakery goods are a whole other story top notch sweets for Everyone’s SugarRush Needs! I drive at least once (if not more) a month from the SFV up to Bishop (roughly 41/2 hr drive) just for “Schat’s Bakery 😉”.....</review>

The best homemade bread and deli sandwiches in the valley.  After eating here, you'll never want to eat at any other sandwich shop.</Review>

Ordered a turkey sandwich and a roast beef sandwich, and waited in a huge line for them. Both were extremely bland, and we didn't really understand the hype behind this place. We also got an apple flavored pull-apart bread, which was a bit stale in my opinion.</Text>

When travelling through Bishop, CA, it's nearly impossible to not stop at Schat's.  Grab yourself some lunch and some pastries to go!  (The baked goods make great souvenirs for your family and friends back home)< /Text>

Schat's had been dear to my heart for the nearly 20 years of memories since first setting foot in the bakery, but a recent experience -- and the way our complaint was handled at both the shop and via email with a manager bearing the same last name as the shop's -- INSULTED us so much for something minor that could have easily been addressed, we will NEVER return. I decided to write this review after the manager failed to make things right and became silent despite multiple follow-ups.

Visiting Schat's had been both a family and road trip tradition for anyone coming with me to Yosemite/Mammoth/Mt Whitney. On July 3, 2017 around 2p, my wife, mother-in-law (MIL), and toddler son stopped by again on our way home from Lake Tahoe. We wanted to pick up some bread and honey for my MIL and another bread for my brother.

While waiting in line, I noticed a sign that stated that a Senior Discount was available. So, I asked, and the cashier said that the senior has to pay for the items. My MIL (a senior) told her that's fine, and was about to grab her wallet when she realized that she had left it in her car. I asked the cashier if we could put our purchase on hold so I could go grab her wallet (she was carrying my son), but then my wife noticed that I had cash and suggested to give it to MIL. The cashier told us in a very abrupt, RUDE TONE-OF-VOICE that the SENIOR has to pay for everything. Seeing me hand the cash to MIL would not qualify. MIL and I both told the cashier that this made no sense, but I went ahead and asked again if we could put our purchase on hold. Again, she rudely told us in a DEMEANING, annoyed manner the total price. At this point, I was about to walk out, but MIL was looking forward to the honey and bread, and I also did not want to disappoint my brother for not getting him his bread. So, I went ahead and paid, and without getting a "thank you for your purchase", we silently left the store and exchanged with one another how upset we were. A short while after, two customers who were in line behind us came by our car to tell us that the way we were treated was inappropriate.

We tried to brush off the experience and continued our journey home. About 15-30 minutes later, I found that all of us were still so upset, I decided to turn around to 1) return the items and 2) speak with a manager. We wanted to let management know that the Senior Discount sign never said that the Senior had to be the actual person paying, that we disagreed with the policy's strictness of not accepting cash given to the senior, and that we were insulted and mistreated. We also understood that there may be people abusing Senior Discounts, but no way should customers be treated the way we were -- POLITELY inform the customer of the policy and provide the option to put the purchase on hold to get the wallet. On a side note, what would stop me from just giving the cash to MIL outside? Was it really worth for the shop to insult customers with such a strict policy?

When I spoke with the pastry supervisor, she listened to what we had to say, and she saw how visibly upset we were. She listened and we appreciated her for that. We were then referred to the bakery supervisor, and as we walked there, we found something SHOCKING: the supervisor was with the cashier the entire time when the incident happened! She was THERE and had done NOTHING about it! We told her our story and explained that we did NOT return for the Senior discount (a mere $3.xx - return gas costs more), but as a matter of principle to discuss the policy and experience. Yet, she decided to just refund that amount and without even an apology (or a small "we are sorry" pastry -- didn't have to be much!) We were going nowhere, and I decided to write management instead once we got home.

Management responded with an apology, noted that she heard of the incident, and would follow up. That never happened despite multiple emails to her the past 2 weeks. Businesses sometimes forget that customers are the reason for their existence. Sadly, Schat's apparently is TOO SUCCESSFUL to care.</Text>

This place has a large variety of quality baked goods. The prices are generally high compared to similar bakeries elsewhere. Most of the prices are either poorly marked, unmarked, or given by weight (probably to hide the actual cost). As with another reviewer, we made the mistake of buying a peanut butter cup before discovering that it was more than $5. Although only the server had touched it (when placing it in a bag), we were told we could not return it.
An OK place to visit if you don't care about price or service.< /Text>

<Review>This isnt to Give a Bad review.. place is Clean, Everything is Presentable.. NO PRICES ON ITEMS, not all items show on the price Signs they have above produce. Many Jams etc No Prices!
Baked items look like( Pies, cakes etc) you can buy at Vons, etc
HOMEMADE GOODS has a distinctive look to each item not something frozen n baked as supply runs low...
Sorry but I Decided not to purchase anything here, to pay a much higher cost on items I can Buy at VONS for lower price but looks the same i’ll go to VONS, Or actually make my own for the real “HOMEMADE” Look n TASTE... 😒👎🏻
Many out of State, or country buyers think this is HOMEMADE when it is not.< /Review>< UserId.>

This is why I want to move to Bishop - and why my waistline would never let me. This Dutch bakery has been here for ever, and they've had lots of practice making a vast selection of cakes and pastries. My only problem was that I only had two opportunities to eat here before I had to move on.< /review>

Pretty sure I've stopped here on every single trip up and back down from June Lake since I was a little kid. Pullaway Bread is A++++ and the Mule Kick sandwich might be even better.</Review>

<text>The go-to place for fresh baked goods if you are travelling highway 395! Stop by, expect to wait in a line for pastries, ice cream, or coffee. As long as you aren't in a hurry, it's worth it.

Very fun eclectic vintage place with lots of bakery products and a line up for freshly made sandwiches. No 3 Pastrami was awesome! It's a perfect stop in Bishop before or after hitting the Mammoth slopes. They got a huge variety of breads, focaccia, bread sticks (bacon cheese too), sweets, cakes, donuts, cookies, ice cream and espresso. No gluten-free or vegan bakery items though. It's a traditional long time establishment, that's a must tourist/break stop.<//Text>

Great food, but difficult parking as it is always busy and crowded.  Parking is easier across the street in a back parking lot. Large vehicles can park there.</Review>

<Review>I love this place, they have the best pastrami in soCal, but a heads up: if you're traveling in the 395 freeway and stopping by Bishop even though the bakery closes at 6, the sandwich bar closes at 4.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Great bakery in my way home from Mammoth. It is a little bit overpriced but I stop there to buy honey and jam and bread from there. Always crowded by tourists.< /Text>

Every visit to the Mammoth area must include a visit to Eric Schat's bakery. I'm serious, you must visit at least once to experience the craziness that goes on here. Oh yeah, the food is good too!</Text>

Please make sure you review your order. I paid with my credit card and realized after the transaction I was over charged. Within the same visit and 15 mins later I was told that I would not get a refund till later that week because they do not do refunds regardless if it is thier fault. That was 2 weeks ago and have not seen a credit on my card. Nor did they want to issue me a receipt for refund . Customer service is horrible. I felt like it has become a tourist trap .</review>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>Coming from Switzerland, I'd say the bread was not as good as people seemed to think. It was decided average by our standards. Very limited options for vegans here, just a couple loaves of bread.
Didn't find anything certified organic, they don't really use older grains like spelt... The wholegrain bread we got was not any better than you find in most Safeways, etc.

Place is mostly hype I'd say and felt like it was focused on amusement of children rather than good quality baked goods.</text><user_id>101785420914086546484< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

<review>Stopped by to pick-up a pullaway bread for my coworker and decided to get a few other goodies for the family. I picked an apple fritter for my husband, which  he mentioned was very most. But, it had only one piece of apple in it and he found it in the last bite. I also got some thin almond cookies which were just ok.< /review>< rating>

The whole restaurant is dripping with arrogance, but at least it's backed up with quality food. The sandwiches and bread are amazing enough to get you past the 1000 signs telling the customers how to behave and how to order. Reminds me of Seinfeld. No soup for you!</text>

What I loved: Chile Cheeze bread. Pineapple cream cheese coffee cake. Shepherder's bread. Sourdough brad.

What I liked: Veggie Deli sandwich. Prices.

What I disliked: The place is crowded and has narrow walkways that makes it hard to navigate. The lines for the deli wrapped around the store adding to the congestion. The apple pullaway cake was pretty dry on the inside.</review>

<time>1505167405001<//time><rate>2<//rate><text>Stopped by here twice, once on the way to Tahoe and on the way back because many people know of it. I have to say, I have never felt so let down by an eatery with such a high review score. It was overpriced to start, we got a bagel egg and cheese sandwich that was only ok, the cinnamon roll and strawberry turnover were both pretty good. Total price was a joke, the wait was pretty long as well. Overall it is not really any better than starbucks, the jams and whatnot, while numerous, we're very expensive. I was going to try to get a sandwich on the trip back but the line was comically long and honestly they didn't look to be worth anywhere near the 10 bucks you pay. Gf wanted a bagel with cream cheese, you have to buy them separately and then you can't get the bagel toasted, we were told flatly "No." Overall, a huge letdown as a recommended stop. The only reason it got 2 stars and not 1 is because the pastry was good and the selection was large. Everything else was a fail.< /text>< pictures>

Way too popular, but great sandwiches, breads, cookies, coffee cakes, donuts, and the best looking Carmel Apple I've ever seen!  Try not to go at noon.< /text>

<text>Excellent variety and quality of baked goods. Favorites are the plain Volkaren, Sheephearder and SF Extra Sourdough breads. Scrupulous canole's. Great minimal processed honey. Downside is its crowded, crazy for lunch. Sanwiches great. Make sure you don't get overcharged! Its happened 2x to me that I have noticed.<//text>< rating>

Legendary Sheepherders Bread with a dizzying selection of fresh made sandwiches, baked goods and souvenirs. Long lines that move quickly is the small price you will pay for some of the best bites on 395.</Review>

Fantastic award-winning sandwiches and breads with a huge selection. It is a very popular tourist destination, so beware visiting during peak hours when the indoor area gets extremely crowded and waits are long.<//text>

If you want to know Bishop, you have to eat once at Schat's. One of a kind place that serves up fresh sandwiches and offers a wide selection of handmade breads, jams, honey, oils and sweets for travelers on Highway 395.< /Text>

< review>
It's an adorably quaint bakery/cafe/store with so many goodies you can feel the pounds piling on as you just take a look around. I got some of their famous chile cheese bread to eat on they way to Mammoth, and then got their ham and cheese bread, an apple pull-apart thingy, and some Pecan "kisses" (thin crispy butter cookies with pecans, YUM!!!) to enjoy on the way back. Also tried their Mule Kick sandwich for lunch on a friend's recommendation: roast beef, swiss, tomato, lettuce, sprouts, jalapenos and spicy mustard on their Mule bread--delish and had a very nice "kick" to it, so the name doesn't lie! It might have had a bit too much produce for me, though--everything was very fresh, but got a little drippy (hate that). Anyhoo, yes it does get crowded and crazy but what famous landmark doesn't? Now I know why it's so famous :)< /review>

This bakery rules a quarter of Bishop, greatfully.  With my chocolate dipped goods, I wave my treat bag toward my old kitchen table with camel feet, taking a thick macaroon in the gut while my parents send cellphone vacation photos of their comfortable, highly experienced visit around Bishop Town.  Erick Schat’s chocolate chip cookies have some of the vitamins energy drinks may own on.  These chocolate chip cookies have a certain kind of toughness that voids their crunchiness at large, or so I really ponder when chocolate syrup icing melts from macaroons on a sizzling hot weekend, devouring macaroons one by one which are designed like fluffy seashells, and celebrating on mild days because I couldn’t easily avoid a Californian bakery responsible for the yummy Sheepherder Bread.  I beat the Sun, but chilled to get happy.  A stranger comes to this bakery’s door through problems in order to delight my wits, and I confess about our needed rest at a time for pastry flour.  Bishop’s bakery here brings together for later moments their menu of slightly powdery macaroons with congealed syrup icing for tasting, to munch from a seashell treat near my home’s open panorama.  Bishop Town is that clad environment which hits beyond rustic food until its friends get a savoring of city life; Bishop is between city and town.  The bakery’s double roast beef deal includes a pairing collection of roast beef sandwiches that my parents say arrive with correct kinds of wet meat texture in freshness and delicious bread flavors, especially for my parents’ road trip history, tasted and relished for their prevailing ideas of love.  Erick’s baking facility in day and bread also serves a fountain drink that’s bigger than a tall Rockstar.  Treats cost Erick’s Bakkerÿ their rich labor.  Like those fluffy macaroons designed by bakers with associations over dessert, real milk chocolate chips on my huge cookie show what are likely among deadliest chocolates due to my Hershey’s factory experience: their ability to become so chocolaty into fun-size muddiness.  Deliciously, seashell macaroons are tasty confections from layered recipes by their extreme freshness.  That huge cookie I mentioned is equivalent of several portions of Oreos.  Bishop Town is two stories behind the rest of them.  Chocolate chips are scrumptious stimulants used to treat daily boredom, many breaks in my green house at the finishing point of exhausting routines where body growth occurs.  Erick Schat’s Bakkerÿ, the outer shell of its taste!  I return to my parents with flavors.  The bakery provides treasures and I’ve known their reflections.  “Have a nice day.”  Cash gets large and small, the cashier pops.  When giant desserts perfect matters, I inform my parents that both a ration’s taste and texture may transcend artificial moments like gravy.</Text>

< Review>
Quirky bakery with lots of character and so much to offer! Warm delicious bakery scents welcome you as you walk in. We went straight to the deli and ordered sandwiches, then got treats and a loaf of bread.
The sandwiches exceeded our expectations, their breads are soft with fresh crunch on the crust. We ordered the mule sandwich and the turkey club. Both very fresh tasting, great veggies and meat that falls apart. Free pickle spears (must be a home recipe, so good! Not your run of the mill Clausen's, thick juicy and flavorful!) And a cookie with each sandwich, yum!
Samples randomly around to inspire, their peach pull apart sample tasted like peach cinnamon roll, delicious!
Their isles were very narrow but the other patrons were friendly and polite, so it wasn't a bother.
In line for sweets we saw strudle, fruit cake, cookies, brittle, bread pudding, pull apparts, cinnamon rolls, gelato and so much more! I was fixing for toffee and was pleased to find some.
We loved the bread from our sandwiches, but when we went back for a loaf to buy and take with us, they were out! I asked one of the workers and she said once the racks were empty it usually means they're all out. We were about to be on our way and the worker came after us saying she could check in the deli to see if there were any left over since they had just closed the deli. How accommodating! We were overjoyed at her thoughtfulness. And happy to have a loaf to take home and enjoy. We would definitely recommend it and come back.< /Review>

I don't care how good  Schat's , it's not worth the hr+ wait for a sandwich, the place it's so crowded that it's difficult to walk or get around inside . The parking lot it's also a mess , sometimes you have to park across the street by the park. I guess for most people wasting an hr +  it's no big deal . We'll be stopping somewhere else from now on.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80be1600fb5ec2ff:0xcfcedd18fdb08a6e< /Gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

It's hard for me to get excited over bread, but this place is all that! It's a bit of a tradition to stop here for lunch on my way to Tahoe, get a sandwich, and a loaf of chilli cheese bread to take on up to Tahoe. It's always crowded mid day, and the cashier girl is always a bit surly. 😂<//Text>

(Translated by Google) This is the most famous bakery in Bishop!

The left side of the store is selling bread and sandwiches, which can be made to order and eaten in the store. In addition to bread, there are various flavors of jam and honey of different flavors.

The right side of the store sells drinks, desserts and ice cream. The gelato here is very delicious! They are made with fresh fruits, not artificial flavors or colors. They are produced in limited quantities every day. It is highly recommended ~

這家是Bishop鎮上最有名的麵包店！

店內左邊是在賣麵包，還有現做的三明治，可以現點現做，在店內食用。除了麵包以外，還有販售各式口味的果醬，還有不同口味的蜂蜜。

店內右邊則是販售飲料、甜點、冰淇淋。這裡的冰淇淋（gelato）非常好吃！都是用新鮮的水果去製作，不是使用人工香精或色素，每天都限量製作，非常推薦～</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Uh` the bakery looks so old~. I went in and said it's a 100-year-old bakery.
Sandwich is the natural taste of ingredients without sweetness. It was like eating Yukhoe Bibimbap at Jinju Emperor's Restaurant. There are also many types of bread. It is amazing that the bread developed here is also made in Korea.

어` 빵집이 되게 오래되어 보이네~. 하고 들어갔는데 100년의 빵집이라니.
샌드위치는 단맛이 없는 재료 본연의 맛. 진주 천황식당 육회비빔밥을 먹는 그런 느낌이었어요. 빵 종류도 많고요. 이 곳에서 직접 개발한 빵이 한국에서도 만들어지고 있다니 놀랍습니다.< /review>< Name>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a traditional bakery located in a small town called Bishop, with the name of the shop and Dutch decorations, it seems that it is a bakery from the Netherlands or started by a related baker.
The typical shipper bread has a chewy surface and is similar to a soft inside. Sandwiches made with this bread are also delicious. The cookies taste good too.
These days, there are many good bakers in Korea, so it cannot be said to be a special taste, but I think it is meaningful in that it is a traditional bakery located in a small town.

(Original)
비숍이라는 작은 마을에 위치한 전통있는 빵집으로, 가게 이름이나 네덜란드 장식들이 있는 것을 보면, 네덜란드 출신이거나 관련있는 제빵사가 차린 빵집인 것 같습니다.
대표적인 쉽퍼더 브레드는 표면은 쫄깃하고 속은 부드러운 식빵과 유사합니다. 이 빵으로 만든 샌드위치도 맛있습니다. 쿠키 맛도 좋습니다.
요즘은 우리나라에도 실력좋은 제빵사들이 많아서 딱히 특별한 맛이라고는 할 수 없지만, 작은 마을에 위치한 전통있는 빵집이라는 점에서 의미가 있지 않나 싶습니다.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Really great sandwiches. But why in three-letter names all bread must be offered even in a bakery like this one packed in plastic.
The selection otherwise is very good. Without my personal bread problem there would easily be 5 stars.

Echt tolle Sandwiches. Aber warum in dreiteufelsnamen muss sämtliches Brot selbst in einer Bäckerei wie dieser in Plastik verpackt angeboten werden.
