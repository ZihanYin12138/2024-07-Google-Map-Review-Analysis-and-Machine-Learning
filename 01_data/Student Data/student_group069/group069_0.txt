<text>The only other place I’ve been able to try yuzu ramen was at Afuri in Tokyo. So you can imagine how ecstatic I was to find out this place also made it, straight in the heart of K-town where I live. The flavor of yuzu is so perfect and subtle, never too overwhelming. It’s a nice contrast to the usual heavy, fatty tonkotsu broth, while still maintaining the deep flavors of the former. Parking was ample on a Sunday afternoon and service was top notch.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsfFqd667tBF5b6L-A0T5oP-Td1k-IJWk577gY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2b952f21ab503:0xe37a316b7ea08308</GmapID></record>

<Review>The service here is excellent. Kind and warm people. The food is almost there. The dishes and ingredients are there. Quality. However, the flavors lack depth and umami too light. I think just adding a bit more salt to everything would seal the deal.

After seeing the impressive rating, I decided to come by. Per the waitress’ recommendation, I ordered the salmon burrata and the burnt garlic ramen. Both were good, not great. I was a little disappointed given the 4.6 rating I had seen on here. They also charge extra if you want water which I thought was strange< /review>

The best ramen in K-town. The broth is the star of this place. It makes your body feel light and refreshed. I love the spicy miso ramen! Favorite appetizers are the specials, I had the kabocha croquettes and the ikura bowl. Also decor is super light and refreshing as well with the light wood accents. It’s one of my happy places that I will always come back to.<//Text>

Let's get one thing straight, I'm not a ramen gal. BUT this place was pretty good. We started with the goyzas which were probably my favorite part. I then got the chicken ramen and it was warm and flavorful. I'd recommend to a friend.<//review>

< Review>
With so many great options for ramen in LA, it can be hard to find a spot that brings it. Iki ramen kills it. The LATimes review via Eater LA brought me and a friend here.

They recommended the burnt garlic bowl, and so would I. Although the broth is what I went for, the perfectly al dente noodles would bring me back. We were also a big fan of the pork bun. I dare to say that it was even better than the ramen. We also tried the crispy rice tuna appetizer. It was so close to being perfect. I loved the fresh tuna and the marinade, but the rice was ever so slightly too crispy.

The decor was minimalistic and cozy. The room itself was small, just like most ramen joints. It can be a little loud if every table is filled, but not unbearable.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and I would definitely come back if I were craving ramen in KTown.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Common wisdom has always held that however good Koreatown ramen was, it would always be second to the more iconic ramens of Little Tokyo and Sawtelle. With the recent arrival of a branch of Silverlake Ramen seeming to take top spot, it seemed like Ktown would forever live in the shadow of better ramen. Iki strikes out at that misconception with vigor, proving that breadth and depth of flavor can go hand in hand and in so doing, easily becoming one of the top ramen shops in Los Angeles.

Most ramen shops focus on doing one thing really well, whether it's the typical rich tonkotsu that anyone would like, or a specific niche that you can't get elsewhere. Iki kicks this cliche to the curb by creating a menu tailored to almost every taste in ramens, while never sacrificing the quality of the dishes.

For those seeking a rich pork broth, you'll want to go for the Burnt Garlic Tonkotsu. The smell alone outs it as the real deal, a tremendous broth full of savor. The eggs are perfectly cooked to occupy the glass-like medium texture between hard and melted yokes, making for a flavorful soft treasure of an egg. The pork is incredible, balancing crispy outsides juicy soft insides. The noodles are thin and hard, which isn't to my taste, but some will enjoy it and it certainly can't come close to ruining the dish. All alone this would be a worthy ramen for some. But it doesn't stop here.

For those seeking a lighter broth, iki has a refreshingly zesty yuzu shoyu. As a tonkotsu person myself I actually found the yuzu broth a bit of an acquired taste, but I know there will be people who love it. The interesting thing is that the noodle type for this bowl was different - a chewier wider noodle I enjoyed more.

It keeps going. Iki has vegan options in the form of its miso ramen and tan tan mazemen (soupless) which use impossible meat. I went with a vegan friend who said she enjoyed it although she noted that for those who want food which doesn't resemble meat, the dish is meant to resemble real pork visually, though she said she could distinguish the taste. Even so she liked the dish overall.

And just when you think you're done, Iki hits an absolute home run with it's desserts. Fans of black sesame will adore their creamy black sesame creme brulee, oozing with sesame flavor under it's freshly carmelized top layer. But my absolute favorite, possibly one of the best desserts I've ever had, was their yuzu ice cream. Smooth and citrusy, the cream is balanced by a sprinkle of brown palm sugar which adds a light crunch and incredible burst of flavor. It is truly an experience not to be missed for anyone looking for a great ice cream.

I haven't even dug through half the menu and when I think of their chicken paitan, special winter truffle butter and assortment of others, I can't avoid thinking of Iki as the menu that keeps giving. Parking is manageable and close, and lines are practically non-existant despite the shop being relatively small. The only reason K can see for this is that somehow no one knows Iki is here so if that describes you, here's the takeaway: Iki is the rising star of ramen in KTown - no matter what taste you bring to their table, you're sure to find something to love!</Text>< Pics>

We have a contender for at the very least, the best bowl in ktown and at the very most, IN TOWN! Iki Ramen is brand spankin’ new but it sure does deliver! This place is designer friendly in both the craft of their light and crispy broths as well in their decor. This was the yuzu shio, of which only one other place in town has, but there it’s just so so.  One of the ELUSIVE 5 BOWL RATING bowls I had in Harajuku was also a yuzu shio. Man, what a tasty broth with the appropriate, albeit standard, noodle. The chashu was freaking soft and decadent and the menma was fresh and not overpowering.  The shoyu, not pictured, was also very good. The wait staff was nice and accommodating as well. Only pet peeve was when the waiter wasn’t able to let me know where they get their noodles from. As far as Japanese owners, I’m not sure, but I think there was a mix of Korean and Japanese in the kitchen. The waiter, not Japanese, also couldn’t understand when we wanted “kaedama” extra noodles which is on the menu, so those were two slight strikes. I suppose the presentation could have been a bit better as well, which makes me think it isn’t a full Japanese kitchen because presentation, even in how the noodles are set, is very meticulously done in legit Japanese ramen. This place was slightly lacking that aesthetic. That being said, very solid spot, great desserts too! Headed back soon!!! It gets ever so close to an ELUSIVE 5 BOWL RATING with a 4.5 bowl rating! 🍜🍜🍜🍜.5 #tonkotsu #shio #shoyu #chopsticks #broth #chashu #ramen #noodle #yuzu #ikiramen<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEL1Qje0YBR0eoyhWGvTQ4TPq5n6PTErS_XyBU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<review>They have waitlist! Yay! I arrived at my check-in time but my friend had not. The staff was helpful and allowed me to be on the waitlist while servicing other people until my friend arrived. I was happy with their service. The other good part of the wait here is it's on the same floor as kinokuniya book store and cute stationery, perfect way to kill time while waiting.<//review>< pics>

Great vegan ramen.

Tonkotsu ramen is fine but it isn’t large enough and the broth wasn’t the best.

Gyoza was mediocre. The rolls were ok.<//Review>

Very good food. They got my girl's order wrong, so they brought us out some home-made ice cream for free. The service was good, and the staff are friendly. The dinning room is small, so you may have to wait a bit, but I enjoyed myself here.</text>

Warning: Very rich uni flavor.  Takoyaki balls are really good too.  Skin was perfect.  I also really liked the salmon blue crab cold dish.  That was a lot of blue crab for the price!  The beers were expensive though.  Don't come here to get drunk on beers.</review>< Pics>

I just had the yuzu shio ramen and it is the most elegant ramen I've ever had. Never imagined I'd use elegance to describe ramen but it was light, beautiful and perfectly balanced with the decadence of the slow braised pork belly. I get the feeling the chef has fine dining experience: as thoughtful details abound throughout the minimal chic restaurant with warm subdued attentive service.
My friend and I shared the black sesame creme brûlée for dessert. Pronounced sesame flavor with a perfect level of sweetness (not overtly sweet like most desserts are).
My new favorite ramen place... I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.< /review>

< review>
Cured me of bad stomache pain haha, ordered the garlic ramen. It was really good and I finished the broth (which I never do). The waygu ramen(most expensive) biggest let down. Taste like MAGGIE soup and the waygu meat is bland, the broth was transparent which tells me it lacked flavor. I would go back for the garlic ramen but never again the waygu<//review>

<review>New hip place in ktown for some ramen with great classics and twists from your usual tonkotsu. I love salmon, heard their quality is quite good, so I had to try some!

SALMON
Salmon Burrata  -- I had high hopes from reading reviews about this but thought it was so-so. Salmon wasn't incredible but burrata was rich and creamy. I thought there could be less yuzu flavor so the honey truffle could really shine.

Salmon ikura bowl -- I had this one for delivery on a separate day. I thought the salmon quality was so so again. But the rice was good and portion size was good. More salmon than the burrata dish, even at the same price, though this bowl was super simple and exactly was as the name says.

We tried each others' food cause friends, and general consensus :
RAMEN
- Tori paitan broth tastes like ham?
- Garlic tonkotsu has strong garlic flavor. Still good with depth in the flavor.
-Yuzu Shio was a favorite. Broth is flavorful and the yuzu cuts the richness of the ramen. Yuzu adds a slight fresh taste to ramen.

DESSERT
- Shio Koji Ice Cream - What is that? Get it.
Rich milky ice cream with tones of caramel. It was unique but familiar at the same time. Shio Koji is fermented rice (hey probiotics, it's like froyo now) but really don't let the fermented funk deter you from getting this. It's not sour at all. Especially if salted caramel ice cream is your flava!
-Yuzu ice cream - very lemony, this was too citrusy for me but friend really liked it.
-Black sesame creme brulee - classic with a twist! Popular in our group. Though Shio Koji was my fav!

I guess one thing that could be improved is phone communication?
Ok they really do not pick up their phone. Our group was kinda big (6 ppl) so I called a few times to ask if they took reservations -- after several days trying,  someone finally picked up, said "no" very bluntly and hung up. It felt like recieving a "kk" but in a call. Ok... Thanks...! Just wanted to ask.

But in person it was better. I came early to grab our party a table, luckily they put some tables together and easily we were all seated! Our server was kind and attentive throughout. :) It's not a big place and the place definitely got busy especially after 7 on sunday evening. They have a parking lot but shared amongst other businesses, it was definitely limited.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

That was one satisfying lunch! This ramen shop is more like an hidden izakaya! The uni oysters, Hokkaido scallops, assorted sashimi, truffle langoustine noodles, takoyaki, tonkatsu ramen... 🤤🤤 all exceptional!
Very rarely that I’d say a quality ramen place could also serve high quality sushi & sashimi. But this one really does. Located in an unassuming strip mall with limited parking spaces. However, it’s walking distance (2 blocks south) of the purple line end station at western & Wilshire.< /review>

Really good soup and pork for the ramen. The pork is amazing compare to a lot of places. Portions are a little small. The burnt garlic ramen is a must get.</Text>

<review>Legit ramen spot in Ktown. The yuzu shio, shoyu, tonkotsu, and miso broths are solid. Everytime I’ve been and sat at the counter the chef hooked it up.  Very well priced too. Recommended!< /review>< pics>

<text>My first visit here was great. Their yuzu and burnt garlic ramen were both delicious! Yuzo shio ramen was very light and refreshing. It was great to share with the burnt garlic ramen which had a much richer broth and spicier.

Would also recommend takoyaki and croquette appetizers to share. However, I would NOT recommend the salmon yuzu appetizer. It tasted fine, but... it was just OK and cost $10 for 4 slices of salmon with some yuzu sauce drizzled. Way over priced. On the other hand, takoyaki was only $4!

Service was great the first time I was here. Second time, it was much busier. Food still came out relatively quickly and service was good, but it took way too long to get the bill. More training on POS system needed.

Overall, love that they have some unique ramen flavors and would definitely come back!

Parking is available in the plaza though it's not a big lot . Kung Fu tea is next door for boba after. Extra points.</text>< Pictures>

Great ramen place! Try the Yuzu Shio ramen. It's definitely unique. I haven't been to a ramen place that has such a variety of different types of broth. The dessert was so-so and the service is ok. Parking is easy and the prices are affordable.< /text>

Yuzu Shio was light, refreshing, and bursting with flavours. Ramen egg was the best I've ever had. Highly recommend the appetizers as well, they were delicious and well done.

This is a hidden gem and the chef is from Japan. The price may be a bit on the pricy side but it's authentic ramen unlike other places in koreatown.</Text>

Five stars are enough for taste, but the amount is too small. I do not usually eat much, but I can not afford to eat.

Tori paitan ramen. 치킨 국물이 얼큰 하면서도 깔끔합니다. 매운거 좋아 하시면 고추 기름 달라 하셔서 곁들여 드시도 좋습니다.

<text>No reservation needed or possible, it’s a first come first serve. To find a spot you’ll have to drive through the campgrounds. It helps to have one person get out of the car and read the permits, sometimes previous occupants forget to take their permits off the site markers, so it’s easy to think the site is occupied. Once you’ve found your desired site, park(each site has it’s own parking spot). Make sure you take a picture of your license plate and remember your site number. Head back towards the entrance of the camp grounds, in front of the info board you’ll find the permits you’ll need to register for you site, oh yes make sure you have a pen too, and exact change, cause you’ll be depositing payment into a slot. I didn’t have exact change, and wasn’t able to find staff around.

I recommend arriving well before evening, so you’re not setting up tent in the dark and with bugs. Beautiful meadow view. Restroom well stocked with toilet paper, trash was emptied daily, clean except for the bugs, but what do you expect, it’s better than porta-potties, functional soap dispensers and sinks with hot water.

What I loved about this campground was that each site has a parking spot and it’s own fire pit and some even have benches nearby. You’re allowed to burn any downed wood, twigs, pine cones around, NOT TRASH.  There are dumpsters around to dump trash. Tons of cute spots to take pictures.

Also some sites might be hard to accommodate more than one car, there’s a parking lot next to the campgrounds.

One last thing, I have sprint and the reception SUCKED, I was only able to receive and make calls. But luckily we didn’t need phone service, just make sure you check the weather & maybe make a make available offline if you’re maps dependent.</text><gmap_id>0x8097483b80d22415:0x63885f0a58a71dd< /gmap_id><date>1595562498680< /date>< user>

Great camp grounds, easy walk to the lake. Would be good if it had shower facilities though.<//Review>

<review>Pretty nice $30 first come first serve no reservation campground about 3/4 mile from Pinecrest Lake.  About 3/4 mile walk to the lake depending on camp site.  Flush toilets with lights, but only a few for the whole campground.  Good fresh water from spigots.  Trees are slowly dying away leaving less and less shade so be nice to the trees when your here.  Most camp sites have several spots for tents, and most have large paved parking pads for at least 2-3 good sized vehicles, several different types of sites from open sunny, to shady, some rocky, some in a meadow and some with tents spots down a hill.  You can hear the highway from the campground louder depending on what size you campng in but its not horrible, but the semis drag brakes can be loud if late at night.  They allow fires in fire pits currently when I visited.  I had to review because there was no good picture of the camp site layout I could find online except their hard to read size number map posted so I had to put a good map I found of the grounds, enjoy, camp, and have fun!! 4 stars cuz its far from lake, lots of sun, limited bathrooms and neighbors houses with lights on all night long.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Me and my family come camping up here every July and I love it! We stay for almost a week and we play games, have campfires, etc at the campground and it is very close to Pinecrest where the lake is at for people to spend time at the beach, boating, fishing, and more while at night there is an outside theater there. And yeah, there is a view of a meadow! 😀<//text>

<text>Facilities need major updating. The views are amazing. The lake is a nice cool down temperature. Lots of cool hiking trails. Boat rentals. They also have an old school shack where you can burgers and ice cream.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x8097483b80d22415:0x63885f0a58a71dd<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is a non reserve camp site located about a mile away from the lake. The sites range in size but many are awfully close to each other. Another issue is the bathrooms were often extremely messy. Dodge Ridge maintenance staff seem to do their best go keep them clean, but this might be just an issue with all the campers. Also the campsite is located next to the Lair of the Golden Bear campsite. During our stay we we're subjected to loud DJs and buses driving around late at night. Not really the kind of camping experience you would like if you enjoy some peace and quiet< /review>

I've been camping here since I was a kid. It is great! Not too far from the lake, big sites, not too crowded. Those reviewers complaining about no showers and no hot water, maybe, should look for a resort not a campground.</review>

I have no complaint about the desserts I’ve been trying, my favorite list is always D2, V11, M4.
And wonder about the customer service was pretty nice and the manager know is cool. The girl took my order with wrong item, but my fault that I didn’t check after check out. Then i knew my order was wrong when i was home. I called them just wanna double check what I ordered, they offer me a free dessert for next visit no matter the fault from me. Of course I won’t take the offer because I understand how hardly all business has been through this pandemic, also just wanna give a review for how nice they are.<//Text>

Cons : the price is higher than other places<//text><gmapID>0x80dd2957310089c5:0xf1b414bb83bc9985</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Oh yeah, definitely a great spot. Got that souffle strawberry pancake and it was super bomb along with the milk tea with flan. Damn good dessert spot.< /Text>

<Review>The almond soup tasted artificial, like it had a perfume smell to it. I don’t know much about Chinese desserts but my friend said the almond soup consistency was not legit. The black sesame soup was good. The rice ball was delicious with the sesame filling. I wish they put more rice ball in the soup. Or had the options for additional toppings. The curry fish ball was not legit and tasted average. The rice ball with peanuts and coconut and syrup was pretty good.<//Review><user>114500465539227367356<//user><GmapID>0x80dd2957310089c5:0xf1b414bb83bc9985<//GmapID><rate>3< /rate><response>{'time': 1537989920814, 'text': "Erina, while we're glad you enjoyed the rice balls and the black sesame soup, we're sorry to hear the almond soup wasn't what you were looking for.

Despite it all, the worker was nice and wiped down the table for us without us asking. Love that its has outdoor seating</Text>< pics>

As a fan of sugar and especially desserts. This place really nails it with their drinks. They got this one drink with flan in it and the fresh creme brule is really on point. Will be coming here often.</Text>

<review>SweetHoney in any location has always been consistently good. Every item I've tried on their extensive menu have kept me satisfied. They have so many great options. A great place to try Cantonese desserts or if you just want desserts in general! Highly recommend this dessert chain.

The wait for this location isn't has bad as the ones on Arcadia or Alhambra locations (or maybe I just got lucky).<//review>< Pics>

Excellent and authentic HK dessert! Lots of options to choose from in the menu. The mango with tofu and pomelo is pretty good and not too sweet, however the papaya sweet soup with the north/south almonds was overly sweet.  Had to water it down with hot water to balance the flavor. Overall a great place for HK dessert as there are none like this in the OC area.</Review>

Got the Mango Pomelo Sago with Grass Jelly, the portions were a good size. I enjoyed the natural Mango flavor of the Sago paired with the sweet Mango chunks. The grass jelly was a nice addition to provide more texture.<//text>

My favorite dessert place for all things durian 😁
My favorite is the durian and matcha ice cream in shave ice. The durian japanese pancake was quite fluffy, but I recommend sharing it since it it gets a bit much after a few bites. Drinks are pretty good there as well. I personally like their takoyakis, but I know their not the most authentic.</Text>

<Review>Service was great. I have been to a few other locations. Overall I think this is my least favorite location. The desserts and all came out quickly. The takoyaki I know isn't a specialty here, but it came out warm not hot and that was kind of a disappointment. The flavor was just okay too. The "black pearl" vanilla and green tea ice cream was perfect though and the gyoza had a nice crunch to it that made it very enjoyable. The staff was super nice our entire stay and kept our waters full. Since this is the only location in the Garden Grove area I will likely return in the future. Check out the Alhambra locations though if you have the time.</Review>< pics>

The place was amazing, loved the portion and the items in the menu.
So good, we were probably the first customer of the day and was quiet when we got in, no wonder this place gets busy.

I loved their desserts, however the taro drink I ordered was a disappointment.</Text>

Hong Kong dessert made with mangos and durian! Yes, stinky durians. There are other selections on the menus as well: soufflé pancake, mochi balls, grass jelly, tofu, drinks, etc. Give it a try. Everything is tasty!</text>

Good Taiwanese dessert shop.  The Taiwanese pancake is so airy and fluffy it's practically weightless.  The popcorn chicken is also very good.  Strongly recommend if you like Taiwanese style desserts.</text>

I've gone to this place a couple of times now and it's always been delicious and super clean.

You walk into a dessert place where they are busy but clean then you know they care about the location.

I usually get the rice ball with sesame and that never disappoints. We also get the jelly with ice cream mix that I don't remember the name of but the ice cream is always creamy and delicious.

I've tried their gyoza here before and it was good and I would like to try the other meat options they have as well.

Customer service is top notch and they make sure you are well accommodated .<//review>

The tasty dessert saves the stars !! I have to dock the stars because of one server here !
I and my friends love the dessert here but every time we came, we always meet a grumpy guy. He seems like doesn’t really like his job much. He doesn’t smile to the customers and his attitude is unacceptable!<//Text>

Delicious unique desserts. Love this place. It's the 1st time my dad and I tried this place out. Our desserts took only about 1 minute before coming out so I'm guessing the ingredients were already ready. Our total came out to be about $35 which was totally worth it.</text>

So after trying this place out I can honestly say that it did not wow me. The mini rice balls were not good because some were way overcooked and the others were hard. The soft tofu was a bit bitter and did not have enough sugar in the syrup to balance it out. Although it is a pretty place, it is a bit pricey for the dessert I got.<//review>

<Review>The ambiance is nice. The customer service/wait staff are friendly! I ordered the coconut juice with red bean. The drink is a little too sweet for my taste and there are so many red beans! My recommendation is to tone down the red beans and make the coconut juice less sweet.< /Review>< pics>

<review>After my sister and I went to get a massage she really wanted to get something to eat. After looking on yelp she found SweetHoney Dessert. It's located in a small plaza with plenty of parking. Anyway walking in...the interior is super clean and modern. This place is a Hong Kong style dessert place with different types of Hong Kong desserts like sago and sticky rice.

I wasn't super particularly hungry but I found the coconut milk sago with palm something and ordered that. My sister then went to order the mango smoothie, coconut sago with a side of fresh cubed mango, and then some fried calamari rings.

Let me just say...the portions look a little small for the sago but they're filling. Do not worry! The mango smoothie is rich and super delicious. The calamari was a bit over cooked but this is a dessert place so my expectations weren't all that high.

The service was great and the server was super helpful with all our questions regarding the assortment of desserts. Also, if you check in on yelp you can get a discount off your entire order.

Side note my sister loved it so much she went back a couple days later with some other friends. I will probably go back if I'm in the area.</review>< pictures>

The durian desserts are the best. Great quality and just the tight sweetness. Desserts are a little pricey so beware.< /text>

<text>Cheated on my Keto diet.  Overall good place for dessert.  A little pricey but they got Durian desserts here and there’s no stinky smell😗🤤.  soufflé made to order.  The takoyaki was not bad either.   Stay away from the curry dumplings.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMaFo7heRoc_M5hGYSPCr8ssTckx9NwxZf0Dg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

My wife and I dropped by here based on a friend's recommendation. We're so lucky we did. They have amazing and very unique desserts.

Normally we would have to fly Hong Kong or Taiwan to eat this type of dessert! Thank you so much for bringing it to OC. This is going to be our GOTO place for desserts from now on!

Next time we're going to bring a bigger group so we can try everything and share. They have so many choices, all with descriptions and pictures to help you order. Nice touch!</text>

<Review>The food was expensive for being bland. They do not make the deserts as tasty as other near by locations. Especially 85 degree does a better job and for a better price. The duriant cream pastry was especially substandard and not exceptionally tasty for $10. The tapioca pudding desert at meat fresh is also ten times better than what I was given here. Also, this business is harrassing me for leaving an honest review.< /Review>< Pictures>

This is a beautiful, organized place and has great customer service. Me and my friend asked for the popular dessert which was The Snow Capped Mountains Mabao Jelly. It was delicious, not too sweet. Durian pancakes was good also, my friend really liked it.
One thing I like the most is that a bowl of dessert is not too big. This way, we can try many different kinds.<//text>

I was totally disappointed after being amped up about trying this place out the whole day. The place is very nicely decorated with a modern touch. It is very clean and modern looking.  You can put your name on an iPad to be waitlisted. We ordered a mango pancake, it was the most disgusting thing I’ve eaten, you get a sliver of sweetened mango, stuff in this thin doughy skin, filled with a bunch of whipped cream. How is that even considered pancake is beyond me. Took a bite and pretty much tasted whipped cream, what a waste of my calorie consumption for the day. Then we had the mango pomelo sago with black jello, this was a little below average with nothing spectacular and the taste is borderline bland. The pomelo made this dessert a little bitter. The calamari ring was decent, but too oily. The best dessert for me was their red bean sesame dessert with three rice balls. I had the least hope for this order, but it was the best. Overall, I would NOT recommend this place, the portion is small, the price is high, and the taste was below average.< /Text>

The dessert is good but it is just overpriced. It doesn't hurt to try it once, but I can't justify the price of their items.<//Review>

They dont open when they say they are. A manager should learn to read a clock or change their posted business hours. Other than that, it's a good panda< /Text>

<Text>I have always like panda express in the past. Today's visit was not the case. Their food prices are up and the portions are much smaller. I could over look some of that because of the pandemic. My food today wasn't good at all. Chicken was hard and couldn't eat it and overall didn't enjoy any of it. My daughter got sick and my mother threw hers out. It's to bad because it use to be one of my favorite places to eat out. I was very disappointed after spending $28.00 and driving home and then tossed it all because no one cared for it and I was to far away to drive back.</Text><gmapID>0x80e832023a4fe1f1:0x8b1d77b5f59c717b< /gmapID><response>None< /response>< date>

I ordered 4 plates today. One of the plates was one entree less. I checked each box before I left the restaurant. When I went back to the counter for the missing entree, the cashier was very rude. I showed her the one entree missing box and wanted she just added the entree into the box but she refused. She said she can’t touch the box because I touched it. Well okay I accepted an extra small box. After I brought 4 boxes home, I realized another box was with a mistaken order too! And the foods tasted too salty. Today’s experience at this restaurant was an awful one! The worst part is one entree short. The cashier didn’t even say sorry for that.< /review>

Very rude woman manning the cash register today.  There was a mistake w my order, when I pointed it out to her, she yelled at me :” DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD OR NOT?” Apparently she skipped the lesson on “customer service”.</review>

Very unfriendly, as if you were a bad person for ordering food. This was probably the last time I eat anything from Panda Express. We have been going to this Panda for years. There are many friendly alternatives for eating out in town.</Text>

This Panda Express location really exceeded my expectation last time I was here.  One of the girls working there so super attentive to everything. I mean she was welcoming everyone, said that she would be right with the next customer in just a moment, and letting the cooks know what is needed with a high sense of urgency all with a smile and friendly demeanor. I wish I could remember this girls name because she definitely deserves some recognition for hard work.< /text>

This restraunt is better than I expected. They have a wide variety of food and they are very organized. The place is well kept and modern. It also has a few good dairy and gluten free options. Like the mushroom chicken or the beef and broccoli. Like any chinese restraunt they have fortune cookies which help bring up my mood.< /text>

< review>
The meat has fat on every bite if not all fat. I ordered the terryaki chicken and some slices were just fat. They don't include any soy sauce or chili sause unless you ask. I hate when my mom gets good from here, it's always terrible. Go to Panda Wok in Simi valley. It's family owned, cheaper, better portions and good cuts of meat. You can tell Panda Wok cares about their product.< /review>

<review>Too all my healthy ,intelligent,  resellers and lovers of shoes out here in our formerly great state of California. This location should not ever be done business with. Idk if its somthing in the water they drink or what but every single employee their is a toxic backdoorer. And i know alot about being toxic. They will lie to your face about pairs of shoes without an ounce of remorse in their eyes. Ive even seen a 11 year old by the name of supreme man cry due too their gluttonous nature for footware. If you made it this far tdlr they back door everything and made an 11 year old cry the day they opened up</review>< UserId.>

{'time': 1599425595243, 'text': 'Hi Chris, including the 8 other adults (Girls and guys) in your group who were trying to change clothes, park in different spots so we would not identify you, hopping fences from adjacent super market parking spots so you could hide yourselves, and try to buy all pairs in order to flip these shoes for more money is not allowed by our Vendors, nor by our policy.   Our staff kindly asked you multiple times, and reminded you of our policy "only one per customer", we know who you are, and if you are not interested to respect our 1 pair limit, then by all means please do not shop with our store.  This claim that we are back dooring pairs, is only your anger speaking out because we sell you more than one pair.  We sell 1 pair per limit, and all pairs are open to the general public who respect our rules.  We discourage resellers as it goes against our vendors rules, and our rules.  Thank you, I would extend ourselves as long as you respect our rules.  If you cannot, then allegations are simply that, without merit and without cause.  Thank you'}<//response>

It was pretty empty when we came as far as customers so we had fun trying out different instruments around the store. Ended up buying $600 worth of podcasting stuff (microphone, mic stand, etc) because the guys working there were so helpful and really knew their stuff. My husband and I were just looking around and thinking about getting a new mic, etc, and Max (I think was his name,  he has blue curly hair)  really made the difference in us buying it and having a great experience. Thank you!<//review>

This was my first time in this particular Guitar Center. I got there just before closing and even so, crew working with simply fantastic and helpful. Why they didn't stalk what I was looking for it the gentleman was quick to repair other stores where I might be able to pick it up. I lived closer I would be visiting this Guitar Center much more often!< /Review>

I’ve been to this location multiple times with specific questions—each of which Taylor has helped with. I left with exactly what I needed every time. This dude is so friendly and genuinely cares to see customers leave satisfied. I can’t recommend this place enough for your music needs.

Thanks again, my dude!</Text>

Shady, Incompetent or both?

The Stevenson Ranch Guitar Center’s customer service is not very good. I called in advance asking about a unit and Dennis the customer service rep mentioned that they had an open box unit that had never left the store but had some minor scratches on it.  This already sounded odd, but I drove in because he mentioned that his manager would give me $100 off the price.  When I arrived, it took Dennis multiple trips to talk to his manager and some time to sort through their new POS software.  We eventually got through my trade in but when it came time to purchase the open box unit the manager only gave me a $50 discount. Dennis fumbled through some discount coupons to get the full $100 discount, but none of them worked, and he indicated that the manager would not budge on the price. This was ridiculous because he confirmed that the discount would be $100 off when I first arrived in the store.  Out of principal I had to call the deal off.  Dennis first expected me to leave my trade in but I wasn’t doing that because I only did the deal with the expectation that I was buying their open box unit.  He then expected me to leave with my trade in and that he would sort out their inventory after hours. At this point my confidence and trust in both him and his manager was pretty low, so I made them give me a voided copy of the trade in agreement and then got out of there.  I would not recommend shopping at the Stevenson Ranch Guitar Center because they don’t honor their agreements.</Text>

<Text>Other than being the smallest Guitar Center ever and usually low on inventory compared to other Guitar Center, it’s a great store. It’s relaxed and usually quiet. The people there are very helpful. I’ve bought several guitars there and sold a one. Despite being a Guitar Center it has a small town music store vibe.<//Text><user_name>Devan Tomas< /user_name></record>

Great lil place for people who want to start playing instruments and reading music. They have a ton of beginner instruments & amps. They also have some high quality instruments for those with more experience. Staff seemed nice and I was asked if in needed any help twice in the 5 minutes I was there.</Review>

<Review>This is a great Guitar Center location. Although my friend's guitar was not repairable they offered him a brand new one at a discount with all the accessories. They have just about everything you could need for guitars, and they also have some other instruments for sale as well. The employees are very helpful and have a good level of instrument knowledge. The store itself is also very clean and organized. Highly recommend this location.</Review><username>Allison Phillips< /username>< user>

Guitar Center... What else do you need to know?!? The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. They usually, (albeit this store is pretty small), have everything you need and if they don't have it, they will order it for you! I love this place!!!< /Text>

This store is good if you know what you're doing. The tech Matt is an amazing person and I definitely recommend going to him if you have any tech problems on your gear. Otherwise the other staff seems to want to avoid you unless you come up to them. Overall this store is good!</review>

<Review>Pretty decent of a selection for guitars. I really wish this was made into a bigger location with more guitar inventory. I've had to order online or visit another store for some things I've needed over the last few years. However, staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and I've always been treated well there. Cool location, but sometimes limited in supply.</Review>< rate>

I have bought both bass and guitar gear here. A medium size Guitar Center. Not as voluminous as the Sunset Blvd one, nor as small as the Santa Clarita one. I have found the staff I worked with both friendly and helpful.< /Review>

I absolutely love coming here! Everyone is super helpful and kind, and willing to take the time to to show you what they got and even recommend. Trevor was especially helpful. I wasn't quite feeling right about a certain guitar and kinda just explained the vibe I had with it. He showed me one that was within my price range and that I absolutely fell in love with. My business will definitely continue here.<//Review>

It's your typical Guitar Center--completely hit or miss. Employees and prices can often be disappointing. If you can wait a couple days Amazon is usually a much better bet.< /review>

I never made it to this location but have been to other guitar center stores. Generally the sales floor people mostly ignore you. Know what you're looking for when you want in. My experience is that the cashiers are awesome and helpful but very, very busy. A great place to check out and play guitars, buy strings, straps and everything in between. One day I'll make it in and hopefully add a couple of stars to my review.</Text>

Don’t buy your musical items here unless you know your stuff. You would think that this place would be an invaluable resource for all your musical needs, but if you must know, my experience here tells me that the staff they employ are inexperienced and lacking knowledge in the products they sell. I waited for a back ordered item to arrive for a week, only to be sold what appears to be a refurbished item. I paid full price for an electric piano, but they handed me an out of the box similar model, without an owner’s manual, no power cord, and no sheet holder stand, all of which were supposed to be standard accessories included in the package. What’s worse is that they try to surreptitiously pass it off as optional items that has to be purchased separately. Checking the manufacturers website on line revealed that those items came as standard accessories. Needless to say I requested a refund. To their credit, they acquiesced easily without much fight. Buyers beware!</review>

I placed an order for a guitar from this guitar center to another closer to me and it was supposed to arrive today but one of the employees forgot to put the shipping address for the other guitar center so now I have to wait over the weekend for my guitar to come in and I’ve been looking forward to it for a about a week now but now I have to wait 3 more brutal days. This mistake on their part is to say the least, extremely disappointing< /Review>

Of course this Guitar Center is smaller than the others.... It's Guitar Center Studios. Just ask the staff and they'll explain what it is. Even though it's small, it still has a really good selection of guitars, gear, and all the quick essentials you may need to pick up. And speaking of the staff, not sure what the other complaint was but it's not an issue of bad staff. The staff was AWESOME. In fact, they seemed to be the only ones willing and able to troubleshoot my audio interface while the one in Hollywood gave me the runaround until my warranty expired. I'm excited to have this Guitar Center in town. If you're into audio recording and such, ask for Preston; used to work for Pro Tools and knows what he's doing.</Text>

Disappointed, and lied to. My bass guitar has been sitting at Guitar Center for 2 months as of now. They continue to tell me should have it fixed very soon.

The repair needed is a new nine volt battery connector for active pickups. I have been getting the runaround for weeks and weeks on end.

On two occasions after having called Guitar Center, one of the employee says, "oh yes it's finished now come down and pick it." I get there and it is has not been touched. That's when the manager tells me again in person, as he has done now multiple times, that he will call me to let me know what's going on... he has never done so, neither has the guitar tech Chris, nor anyone else at Guitar Center.These guys are unaccountable. :(

do not take your instruments here for repair, unless you dont need it fixed for months.<//text>

Brought in an Explorer guitar trying to sell it. While they looked it over, I notice the exact same used guitar in HORRIBLE condition up on the wall marked $199. Mine does not have one single scratch on it. The one on the wall had a totally trashed paint job on it. Their offer for mine? $45. I pointed out what they were selling the identical model in junk condition for, and got an extremely snobby "So? I'm only giving you $45 so sign this paper, take your money, and that guitar is ours now." I said "No, screw that. Give me my guitar. I'm leaving with it!"
She then tried to tell me that once I asked what theyd give, I was legally obligated to sell it for their offer (which is a total lie). I told her I was calling my cop friend to have them get me my guitar back (I had not even been shown a penny yet) to which she replied "Fine, take your stupid guitar and don't ever come back here, @$$ hole."
That won't be a problem at all. I will NEVER go to ANY guitar center again. Never once met a decent employee at ANY location I've ever been to. Guitar Center is the worst store on earth.</Text>

Their products are amazing, and the staff was very helpful. I got a PA system, mics and stands, an amp, and xlr cords and I am very satisfied. The staff showed exactly what was good quality and where everything was. Definitely coming back here!<//Text>

Really meant to get the young guys name, if the guy with the key to the headphones is reading this, I'm the guy who didn't like the elastic band headphones.. Lol.

The young man helping out my son and I was really informative.  Took is time with a couple of guitar newbs.  Answered a bunch of questions.  Had good insight into what might be ideal for entry level stuff.  And helped point me to the more affordable priced equipment, ideal for a newb.  Good experience. Good service.  Thanks guys!</text>

<Text>Wow.....talk about lack of customer service.....4 or 5 employees so busy talking about themselves amongst each other around the cash register that not one of them aknowledged my presence in the store in the smallest guitar center square footage wise in the history of the business. Guys, the customer is the only way you make your money, talk about how rad your music hobby is going on your own time....I'm here to spend my hard earned money, that's why i drove to the store in the first place.......came in walked around picked several drum related items looking for sons first drum set......no staff concern, yeah i can walk up and ask, but thats your job.....now ive been to great guitar center stores with amazing staff.....maybe this was a rare night, but what a joke.....work on your best business practices guys, acknowledge a customer has entered the facility with a simple hello at the least and start earning a paycheck....</Text>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Saying you know everything about drums is a good thing, but be realistic. Guitar center does not hire experts, they hire kids that will work for minimum wage, and put up with us know it all musicians.
Are you going to work part time, for minimum wage, and smile when some kid comes in with his parents wanting a "piccolo china crash ride spash hat" or some other non-existant mumbo jumbo?
Will you keep smiling and figure out what the kid wants, or are you going to laugh at him, like you laugh at the kids in guitar center?
If they did hire you, and you go on a road tour, then what?
Guitar Center has different levels of shops. this is a little shop, then they have normal shops, and in some areas they have "pro-shops", where pros go in to talk to pro's and buy pro equipment. You will know it when you see it, due to the dozen latin percussion displays,the 3 DW kits on display, the rush 30th aniversary set on display, and the 48 piece gilbrater rack with 4 bass drums on a meter tall platform above it all.
Guitar Center is there to make money. If the stevenson ranch store is selling $100,000 a month in drums, expect guitar center to expand the drum area there.
Until then, be glad you have someplace close when you break your last set of drum sticks.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful store where we find gibson, fender, an avalanche of choice and opportunities for musicians in a really cool and Californian. I love the team at this store, always good advice, much better than an online purchase.

< Review>
I am an avid small business supporter and this is one of the barbershops in the neighborhood. So I walk into Shorty's with my 3 boys and daughter around 3 in the afternoon on a Sunday. There are two barbers present, one sweeping and one chilling on the bench. I was greeted with "they're all gone home", so I mentioned the OPEN sign is ON and the door is OPEN. Again the guy sweeping insists everyone is gone. I look around and said "Ok I Guess You Don't Want This Money" turned my kids around and we left.
To my SURPRISE the front door to the barbershop was still OPEN and there were people still inside an HOUR and a HALF later when I drive by.
I'm a white LADY with mixed KIDS. Maybe they have issues with people LIKE me. They definitely don't have to worry about me bothering them with my money EVER AGAIN.< /Review>

< Review>
By far one of the most underrated shops . dont miss out on the best hair cut at a fair price . you cant go wrong with booking an appointment with shorty himself. Appointment link in comment. Yo..this barber is sick! leland lara. Shortys, 2395 Fruitridge Rd, Sacramento, Ca, 95822. Download this new app theCut at book.thecut.co/Blessedhandzshorty to book appointments with them and see their work.< /Review>

<text>Terrible cut, soon as I came in the guy got on the phone before I can really explain the details of how I want my haircut. Very unfriendly staff and unprofessional, the guy ended up cutting my mustache and sideburns out of nowhere. He didnt ask or give no warning that he was about to. I walked in there to fix up one side of my fade and I walked out of there with a crooked mustache and messed up sideburns looking worse than before.</text><rate>1< /rate>< Resp>

Very very unprofessional,  I brought my son in for a cut and asked if they took walk ins, they said yes, so I asked them how long until my son could get his hair cut, he did not give me a time he asked me hOW long I could wait, well I am not sure when you will be done with your current client so how can I tell YOU when I want my son to get his hair cut, so he asks me well are you busy, do you have somewhwre to be and although I was not busy I had just gotten off of work and had only had 5 minutes to be home to change and then take my son to get his hair cut, so I told him no I do not have any where to be but I do want to go home, so he tells me, well then maybe you should just go home. I simply said ok instead of going off the deep end and showing my son it is ok to be rude back. To top that off, tge place was discusting,l and cluttered.  I made the biggest mistake WASTING MY TIME AND stopping off to this DISCUSTING AND VILE PLACE, it's safe to say I will never make that mistake EVER AGAIN. Maybe the owner never went to business school to learn how to run a professional business.</text>

Place is horrible... language is major problem not caring who's there kids or elders. The wait is forever, everytime & I mean everytime I have been there I would spend about 45min to   1 1/2hr just waiting. All the guys working there are always talking about how the kick back was yesterday & of course Smoking W & how they got F' ed up last night. I stopped going & will never ever go again.< /review>

Great barber, but prefer to wait 1hr at the most in the weekend to get your regular haircut $20. It seem like this place always have more appointment only haircut $32 than walk ins 😞. May be weekdays are better 👍. I wish though each barbers 💈 can alternative between appointment call and walk ins in the future 😉.</text>

My husband & I just moved to California from Texas. He was really looking for a new barber. Especially one who does bald fades. Well I did some searching & found M & J Barbershop because it's close by where we live. I must say I'm IMPRESSED! When my husband came home I was like WOOOW LOOK AT YOU! So kudos to the barber who faded my husband! You did a GREAT JOB! I really love the haircut! My husband has a new barber now!😀👍❤< /review>

Go once/month there to get a haircut. Staff is very friendly, knowledgable, and funny af to get a professional cut. Very chill laidback af atmosphere. Might be a minute sometimes before it's your turn to get a cut: bring something like a book (a Grandma's Ipad) to keep you occupied.</review>

Always get my haircuts here and i always have a good time. I usually don't go when it's busy so I've never really had to wait too long. I recommend this place to people even though there is always the small chance of error. Check out my barber junior though for the hookup on eyebrows and a nice fade.</Text>

Pretty much everyone that works here does an amazing job. You can come in and give them minimal directions on how u want your hair and you're guaranteed to be happy with what they do. Only problem is the wait time is insane<//review>

Great place to come and get your haircut. There's a little bit of a wait sometimes but the barbers do a great job. My godson is Autistic and the barber cutting his hair took his time and had patience with him. Thank you</Review>

<Review>dedicated everyday joe haircut spot. These guys are smart, they took the best of the local talent and put them here. Chasing that perfect haircut, your gonna find it here. It can get busy, that's because they know what they're doing.

Putting the pride back in being a barber. Oh yeah, they use straight razors for cleanup, can't beat that.<//Review></record>

I've tried most of the barbers at this shop, and I haven't had a bad experience yet. Wait is long so be prepared to wait a little bit if you're planning on doing a walk in.

They all appeared not to be in a hurry, taking their time to do and finalize their work. The shop was clean with several large screen televisions, each on a different channel. That didn't seem to create any problems. The have a $3 discount for "senior" citizens too.<//Text>< pictures>

I've tried other shops in town and still this is the best haircut establishment around! Everyone's skill level here is A+.  It's also great that I can watch all the games on all the 7 or 8 tvs they have going around the whole shop. Keep up the good work.< /review>

<review>Maybe the worst haircut I've ever had. The guy left my hair completely uneven on top and the hair line looks like a mess. I told Chuy to leave it 1 inch long on the top... looks like he left the left hand side an inch and cut most of the rest down 1/2 inch. (I even mention it the first time he put the mirror in front of me and he still left it uneven)
I normally don't write reviews like this unless I really liked something about a place but I think people need to know. Maybe they have a few good barbers but I got stuck with the worst. I don't think these 5 star reviews reflect the service I got.. Nice guy but he really messed up my hair before an important event.. overall disappointing.</review><gmap_id>0x80c28887d4a53879:0x3f286e2e20d393bb< /gmap_id><response>None<//response>< time>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Worst barbershop experience. It isnt an amusement park so theres no reason why i should be waiting almost two hours for a haircut , and an average one at that. Don't go unless u have all day to spend there, a fat stack of cash because their prices are outrageous, and unless you want some immature people cutting your hair.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Cuts aint all that maybe for people that don't know a thing but when I went there I seen plenty of choppy work and the fades most but not all were not blended in well at all. Ill stick to my old barbershop in the SFV</review>

I recently moved to Santa Clarita in the last 3 months and this is the best barber shop I've found in the SCV. The shop is clean, flat screens on the wall, all the guys are professional, and the cuts are always dope. They use a straight razor for edge ups and beards if u want. Chuy and Jose have both hooked me up every time I've walked thru the door. Great local spot!</Review>

After leaving I realized how bad my hair cut was, almost the worse I had in my whole life, planning to have my wife cut my hair instead of going anywhere paying someone to screw my hair, I’m really unhappy this time.

<review>I was just driving through on a road trip. Feather River Canyon is always beautiful.  Unfortunately,  on my way home, I came upon a horrific accident. It's my understanding there is a lot of accidents in this particular area.  Perhaps they should fix the roads around there.<//review></record>

Short walk down to the river. Nice cold mountain runoff (probably warmer in the late summer/fall).<//Review>< pictures>

Feather river canyon is one of the most unique places I go. I travel all over the western United States. I always look forward to going through that canyon.< /Review>

So beautiful this time of year. Actually any time of year. The fall colors will captivate your attention so be sure to pull off in a safe place and take it in that time of year, or have a pilot. Some current road construction but nothing thay held us up much. Still very worth the drive.<//text>

<text>THIS PLACE NEVER GETS OLD. A NICE PLACE FOR A MOTORCYCLE RIDE OR TO TAKE THE FAMILY. STOP AT THE REST AREA AND READ HOW THE HIGHWAY WAS BUILT USING THE MANUAL LABOR OF INMATES AND DYNAMITE. IVE BEEN THRU THIS CANYON TO SEE THE CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS OF THE FLOODING (SEE ATTACHED PIC) ALL THIS AMOUNT OF WATER WOULD HAVE DEMOLISHED THE TOWNS BELOW IF OROVILLE DAM HADNT STOPPED IT.

<review>Safe and beautiful place to stop! It is just a short (but thorny) walk down to the water. The water was very cool when we were there in mid June. The water is swift but not unmanageable. There is an information station located at the left side of the parking lot. This was our second trip here, there are signs posted that the water can rise suddenly but it has been around the same level both times we were here.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

This was my first time taking the Highway 70 route to Chico. It may be slightly longer from Reno but the scenery makes the extra time with it.  It rained most of the way and the 2 sections of road construction really didn't matter. The stunning greens and the river were all Beautiful.  Its is truly worth it.<//text>

This canyon is so beautiful and rich in history, and im happy to see that there's people breathing new life into the historical places that had been dormant for so long. Side note: I'm all for sharing the road, but if you're a bicyclist, please please please DON'T RIDE THE CANYON. Often the road is narrow, turns can be tight, corners blind. Big trucks come up and down this highway all day long, often crossing into the oncoming lane to make turns. If im coming around a corner and there's a truck in my lane coming at me and my choices are hit the truck, or hit you on your bike... I'm sorry buddy. We have a lot of great places to ride up here, beautiful valleys, epic mountain bike trails... the feather river canyon though, it's just not safe.<//text>

A beautiful scenic drive through Hwy 70 along the Feather River Canyon.
Notice how the river flow upstream almost 2500 ft. high alongside the road  through the winding Plumas Mountains.< /review>

I recently purchased a music box from Music Box Attic.  The craftsmanship on the music box is outstanding.  Equally important, the customer service was truly exceptional.  Boris and Jessica could not have been more patient and accommodating, especially given that I had never before purchased a music box.  The entire ordering/purchasing/shipping process was smooth and efficient.  Most important, my recipients was overjoyed with the music box.  Thank you, Music Box Attic!< /Text>

Fabulous  product and fabulous people.  I was gifted one of these beautiful music boxes as a remembrance of a loved one who passed.  It is beautifully made and is a very special way to show someone you're thinking of them.  I highly recommend this product.  The customer service is superb. I had an issue with what I thought was a malfunction and Boris worked with me to make sure we got it figured out. Turned out it was operator error, not the box itself.  Always professional throughout the process of discovering the issue.  Five Stars.</Review>

<Text>Boris and Jessica’s customer service and ability to foster meaningful customer relations are second to none. The entire purchasing experience was amongst the best I have ever had with consumer goods. They were extremely helpful, knew their product inside and out, accommodating, and even helped me in picking the perfect product for the occasion. Their music boxes are reasonably priced and are of exceptional quality. A must have for unique and meaningful gifts. They also are very creative and helpful in the way they handle custom requests. Be sure to message them for any inquiries - you will not be let down. Thank you so much musicboxattic team!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

A while back, Music Box Attic made a custom music box for my young daughter. It was so nicely done, I chose not to give it to her right away as she was kinda young. Now that she is older, I hope to give it to her as more of a big girl present rather than a toy. I like how I was able to pick which tune I wanted in the music box. Customer service was superb. Thanks Music Box Attic!<//Text>

They were quick, responsive, offered solutions and continuous reassurance, throughout the whole sale. More importantly, they were kind and patient with every question and concern. The music box itself is beautiful and just as pictured. The song choice was correct and the picture engraving was well done. I recommend ordering from Music Box Attic for anyone special in your life, or just a cute keepsake for yourself. Definitely worth it.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I ordered a music box and when it arrived I wrapped it before opening the  box. I called to check status of delivery and they assured it had already had been delivered. They immediately sent another to replace it. When my wife opened it I was embarrassed to say the least. When the second box arrived I returned it to them. That to me is fantastic customer service. Great company to do business with. Highly recommend them.< /Review>

I purchased a music box as a Christmas present for my daughter.  It arrived promptly, and packaged very securely.  The box itself is stunning; very sturdily made, with a beautiful finish.  The sound quality is amazingly clear.  But what I am most impressed is the fantastic customer service!  I'm very "technologically challenged" as my kids say, and I needed some help after downloading the song.  I posted a question on Amazon, and within a couple of hours, I was contacted by the owner of the company, who offered his help.  I sent him the mp3, and within minutes he fixed it and sent it back to me, all at no additional charge.  I highly recommend this company and their wonderful music boxes!  I promise, you won't be disappointed!<//Review>

I have purchased music box movements from Music Box Attic many times over the last 25 years. This time I got the  digital sound modules for the six cedar chests I am building for my Grand daughters. Being able to program  custom music favorites for each Grand Daughter has made these chests even more special. Music Box Attic gave me great pricing, access to any of their favorite music box songs and really out did themselves on service.<//text>

Just wanted to tell Boris thank you for sending the replacement music box for the music box on the left in the picture.  The original one only played random notes.  I have found someone who loves it, they were happy to get it.   It was shipped quickly and arrived before Christmas.

Both of our music boxes are so unique.  We never see anything like here on the east coast.  They are beautiful.  We have ordered before, and will keep an eye out for that unique gift.</Text>

Music Box Attic wanted US$50 to post a tiny 18 note mechanism to Australia, that's more than twice the cost of the mechanism.  Luckily I have a friend in US and she posted it on to me for US$14 (using original packaging), so ultimately Music Box Attic lost out because they had to pay postage to her (free in the US).  Really suggest a review your postage charges because I would definitely buy more if the postage were more reasonable. Edit after response from owner - I just point out that I added a photo showing the postage cost was indeed $14 (not $50), it was posted "snail mail" and I received it in under a week (not months) and if the postage cost is not "up to you" then who is it up to that you were gouging $36 on postage? Finally, I reiterate - it is not a negative review of the product, just the price gouging on postage.....so you did do "something wrong" as well as something right.....< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_x4ifsehLSePats5HSoO0tFAY5UiDx22PLatA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1567830017387, 'text': "Hello, I am sorry you feel the postage is too much, unfortunately this is not up to us, we don't ship by snail mail across the world or it would take months. We only ship via safe and quick methods. We really feel this review is not justified because we work super hard to meet every customers requests. If you didn't want to pay the cost for the shipping, which for the type of service we use (DHL Express) the cost is higher then even $50, then of course you are not obligated to purchase from us, but to leave a negative review is a bit unfair. We didn't do anything wrong or provide bad product or services. We really wish you would remove this review as it is unwarranted for our hard work we do daily. Please reconsider it Janine. Shipping costs to Australia via even regular priority service are no less then $40, include insurance and any other expense and you are at $50."}< /Resp>

A Memorable Gift for My Daughter!

I was looking for a special gift for my daughter for her graduation.  I was so lucky to find Music Box Attic.  I spoke to Boris about what I hoped to have in a music box for my daughter, which was a music box with her name on, a song that I sang for her every night when she was a baby, and an engraved personal message to her.  Boris said he could make it happen.  And he did it--so beautifully!  I was so happy when I received my music box.  It was beyond my expectation.  Thank you so much, Boris, for this beautiful music box.  I cannot wait to give it to my daughter.  I know she will love and cherish it forever.  Music Box Attic is a trustworthy company and delivers products as promised.  I will definitely order other products from Music Box Attic again for my next special occasion.</Text>

<Review>On the birth of my daughter I wanted to get her something special. Boris over at the Music Box Attic definitely helped me. Through several pen pal style correspondence emails, Boris guided me to the box that was the style I wanted and within my price range. It was beautiful and when Christmas came around this year I knew where I was going to pick up a gift for my dad. These guys are experienced, professional and will treat you like family. Especially if you're a returning customer. It's basically like walking into Cheers. Everyone knows your name and gets your issues handled with quickness. I really can't say enough good things.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>I bought this Jewelry Box Organizer as a gift for sister and she absolutely loved it. I spent hours in searching for the best Jewelry Box Organizer out there and I had decided to buy this due to the product price and look. When I gave this to her on Easter, she was really happy and is now full of her jewelry and watches. I highly recommend this product.</Review>< user>

Music Box Attic deserves more than 5 stars! I had a customized order for Valentine's Day and emailed the company with a question. Boris wrote me back quickly. He was super nice, helpful, and tailored my order to specifically to what I needed. The music box I received was exactly what was shown on the site. The quality of the box was excellent. It also shipped super fast and shipping was free (a great bonus!) I definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a sentimental gift for someone special.<//Review>

I have not received the music box yet but if the quality is like that of the customer service than it was absolutely worth it. My questions were always answered pretty early the next day (I kept emailing after business hours) and the responses were direct and well spirited. I also liked the customization options for the music and engraving.</Text>

<text>I purchased a music box in Germany while we were on vacation there for a birthday present for my mother who had visited us in Germany while we were there on a military assignment.  We thought the connection with the past was a perfect gift, unfortunantly when we got home the music did not work on the movement.  Music Box Attic was contacted for warranty repairs and they immediately sent us a new movement.  The new movement arrived within a couple of days and the music box is in perfect condition.  Thank you for the fast service and helping get this fixed so fast.< /text>< pics>

It was sent directly to my grandson's out of state address. I chose it based on the photo and information posted on the Music Box Attic.   It was a perfect choice.  Her parents are so pleased with the quality of it and said the tune quality is excellent.  Baby Scarlett laughed when her Dad Danny played it for her.  It arrived in perfect condition, too.

I recently orders a music box from Music Box Attic.  Here is a company that does it right.

Ordered the Music Box on a Tuesday and it arrived on Saturday.
I made an error in the order and emailed  Music Box Attic of the error.  They emailed me back within an hour letting me know the error had been corrected.
Here is how the music box was packed.  Music box was in a “satiny” drawstring bag, in a box wrapped in packing material.  This box was in a larger box packed in packing peanuts.
The Music Box itself is beautiful.  Sound is clear and exactly as advertised.
The engraved plate add that extra touch that makes this a perfect gift.

No issues, no problems a great on-line experience.< /Text>

<text>My girlfriend wanted a snow globe that plays Clair de lune. Music Box Attic was able to change out the tune for a fee. And made this the perfect gift for her. Ordering online was a little confusing... but online customer service chat replied and guided me through within 3 minutes. Pretty awesome.<//text>< pics>

Excellent service.  Denny was very helpful in my selection choice of song and box.  He went above and beyond helping me locate the music I wanted.  The packaging of the music box is some of the best packaging I’ve seen.  The music was
More than I expected, the engraving plaque beautiful and the box stunning.  I looked for over a year to find something and the MBA was amazing, the staff exceptional!  Thank you so much for creating my dream present.   Karen<//text>

The box is beautiful and the people are wonderful to work with. I sent the box back once because the music seemed too loud. I would recommend getting the volume controls or do as I did and cover the speaker with something such as an engraved plate. The next time I sent it back because the music did not start consistently. The explanation was that the sensor in my box is extremely sensitive to light. Although the room has a lot of windows the spot that I had it in must still not get enough. All postage was covered by music box attic at no expense to me.</text>

I bought this Jewelry Box Organizer as a gift for sister and she absolutely loved it. I spent hours in searching for the best Jewelry Box Organizer out there and I had decided to buy this due to the product price and look. When I gave this to her on Easter, she was really happy and is now full of her jewelry and watches. I highly recommend this product.< /text>

It's nice to deal with reputable companies and I wanted to make sure to let people know that Music Box Attic is a trustworthy one. Also, I wanted to say that the music box my son ordered was incredible. It exceeded his expectations, and personally I was truly impressed by the quality. If I'm ever in need of purchasing a music box I know where I'm going to buy it! Boris is a great customer service rep!!</text>

Kudos from a first time customer.  Couldn't be happier with the service and the item ordered (Artistic Beveled Octagonal Music/Jewelry Box with Floral Motif).  Prompt Shipping...packaged beautifully...stunning finish...clear sound.  Although this is a gift for my oldest granddaughter and I have yet to give it to her, I am sure she will love it.  I am certain to be a return customer.</text>

I would give Music Box Attic 5 stars hands down. Our journey together was not an easy one due mostly to my perfectionist nature and some minor miscommunication. Boris stuck with me throughout the whole experience and, in the end, helped me achieve success so I could present my wife with a gift she absolutely loved! Kudos to Boris, Denny, and the entire staff.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Amazing product, Amazing service. Boris will take care of you. The box i ordered is see through and i had requested that the engraving be in a plaque and not in the actual box because it is cheaper that way. Boris said it looked so much more beautiful in the box, so the upgraded me at no extra charge. Now that is what i call excellent customer service! If you have any issues with ANYTHING he will do his best to assist you. Wonderful experience. I WILL be back to order a gift in the future. Thank you Boris! Thank you Music Box Attic! :)<//review>< pics>

<text>Great service.  Downside was the music the box played.  I selected "Amazing Grace" - and it plays at a tempo much faster than I've ever heard it... to the extent that it takes quite a while to figure out what the song is.  The website, however, did reference an artist - and perhaps this artist has a different rendition than what it such a common score.  If such is the case, I would have done well to check first.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Visited the Music Box Attic location here in Hollywood. As an inexperienced novice looking to buy a music box for my friend, I ended up visiting the location not even having a solidified design or song in mind. Luckily, the music box staff was extremely kind and patient and I ended up leaving with an acrylic violin shaped music box w/ the Magic Flute song within an hour of my arrival. I really recommend them. Shout out to Denny for being the best. He was kind, professional, and hospitable.< /Text>

The music box came today. It’s beautiful! And as soon as I opened the box I smiled. My wife and I heard the song, “Manoir de Mes Reves,” played by a violin & guitar duo on one of our very first dates. We loved it so much that we hired them to play at our wedding. This is such a perfect anniversary gift!

Thanks,

This place is a little tricky to find exact location. There is no banner or sign for the store name but I assure you Google maps takes you to the right place. It's a small, nice and great customer service place walked in and before I knocked the guy walked out and greeted me took me in told me to have a seat shower me some music boxes I had already looked online for and added the aloha oe Swiss tune in it. Showed and played the examples it was perfect paid and went on my way home. I would come and buy again for future reference on gift ideas for loved ones they have a variety of boxes and custom choices along with many music box tunes.< /Review>

Not only was the final box I received beyond expectations but the customer service here is amazing. UPS lost my first shipment (a custom anniversary present for my wife) and Boris at Music Box Attic replaced it for me without charge.

This was a gift for a good friend,  now it was totally my own fault,  I had clicked on the tune , you've got a friend, and some how it rolled up to you're 16.  I happen to notice it. about an hour or so after the order was placed when I was looking at the confirmation e-mail,   so I called the 800 number to let them know my mistake,  I spoke with a man , told him what had happened and told what tune I needed,  he said not to worry , he was changing it to the tune I needed, that he was doing it manually , he said don't worry it will be changed,  It was not,  got,  you're 16,  I was very disappointed with it all,  I did not have time to send it back,  I had to give to my friend on Saturday,   Not really your fault,  but it could of been changed easily for me,  after the owner read my review,  he was gracious enough to replace it for my friend Paula,  and it happened real quick as well,  thank you so much for your service and for doing it so fast
John RonJe

Update,  My friend Paula received her box with the correct tune,  You've got a friend, it was a song I use sing to her when were kids,  thank you again for your prompt service in correcting this issue for me !!!</Text>

I ordered a jewelry music box for my wife for our anniversary.  The box is beautiful.  The particular music I requested sounds great.  I had it engraved and they did a fantastic job.  Couldn't be happier.<//text>

The representative at Music Box was amazing. Boris, my rep was extremely helpful in fulfilling the need of having the volume on music box increased due to the recipient's hard of hearing. The box itself is beautiful. A bit on the high priced side but worth it.
Thank you very much.<//review>

Friendly and very helpful customer service. Their products are top notch and far exceeded my expectations. My fiancée loved the jewelry armoire I made for her and the musical movement with our song brought tears to her eyes. It made it so very special and personalized. Thank you Music Box Attic for helping to make her Birthday unforgettable and me a hero.<//review>

I am so very happy with the customer service. I didn't get the percentage off my order and I wasn't sure why. A day after my order was placed I realized I didn't get the discount. I contacted the company right away and they took the money off the order with no issue,no question.

I didn't see the gift in person, but my brother and his wife were very happy with it, so I'm sure it is as represented. I would definitely buy from this site again and highly recommend it to everyone I know.<//Review>

<review>Product came damaged, scratches on the music box itself, the engraved option was a very poor engraving. And the point where the guitar is supposed to attach to the base is a VERY poor design and I will have to super glue it back together since it came apart during shipping. Overall not good quality. Would rerun, but it's a gift and don't have time so I will have to fix it.</review><user_id>100079659596462063628<//user_id><Rate>1< /Rate><Name>Josh Spisak</Name><response>{'time': 1532635610394, 'text': 'Dear Josh, we are very sorry for this, these are usually great and hold up very well.

Sellers were very accommodating when my music box was shipped to the wrong address at no fault of their own. I highly recommend The Music Box Store to any and all future customers.</Review>

The music box was cute enough but I spent an extra $20 for an engraved plate, it was a cheap little label that was floating around in the music box, the double sided tape didn't hold. I had to take the box apart to put the plate back on.<//Text>

<Text>I ordered the Goat Cheese Omelette and it was delicious. An interesting combination with artichokes and chives - I definitely recommend it as a pleasant vegetarian breakfast option. The hash browns that came with my omelette were a bit too greasy to my taste, I will get the home fries next time instead. Great breakfast food and reasonable quality of cafe latte.

Food was delicious, and service was SUPER fast. No in door dining/seating as of 3-20-21, however there are plenty of seats outdoors with heaters and cover. Good price for what you get, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. We will definitely be coming back!</Text>

Great experience! Outdoor dining, great weather, friendly staff, and yes good food. Always better on weekdays vs weekends as no waiting. Try the Huevos con Chorizo, salmon crepe and the house special is always good. Guatemalan coffee to top it off.< /review>

<user>112297807733830136708< /user><Review>Wonderful little spot near Stanford with great service and delicious food. We came on a Sunday and noticed the local Farmer’s Market was set up across the street. We had a small party got there early which allowed us to get seated faster. We sat at the bar and had excellent prompt service. Servers were very on top of filling up our coffee. What set them above and beyond was that I accidentally spilled my coffee and the service was so quick to respond I had fresh napkins and a clean spot shortly after. Great experience overall and we recommend to anyone coming through.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsyO7DyasmA1rNuBRi4w549ywx4tydrlwd1PPU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< name>

<review>They are more like 3.5 stars, but I feel generous. This analysis is before the strict instructions for lockdown.

I have always walked past this cafe, but until now, I have never managed to eat here. We came for an early brunch, and fortunately it's just not packed as usual yet. The outdoor seating is spacious and shady. We were sitting in a corner and the menu was conveniently taped to the table.

I got a smoked omelette of salmon and it was fine, but I should have demanded that the cream cheese be withheld. There's a really fluffy omelette.

Our waiter is very sweet, polite, and focused on protection. He asked us to ensure that when we order or when food is delivered to us, we wear our masks.

Overall, this is an excellent place for quick, attentive service.</review>< user>

Joanie's Café never disappoints.

They have plenty of outdoor seating with heaters. There's still a line and wait time like pre Covid but service it very fast and friendly.
The menu is laminated on the table so you don't have to touch one and they clean well after a table leaves.

Goat the goat cheese omelette for the first time and it was delicious.</review>

DISAPPOINTING! I just ordered from this place. For an omlette that isn't big at all, was $20. Totally over priced if you ask me. The quality was just not there. Not only did I order this with a side of toast, they seemed to have lost the toast.

This was ordered at 9:47am and my food was delivered to me by 10:31am. It was not Door Dash is delay either. I watched the status of my order the entire time on my screen. I am literally less than a mile away from here. I heard this place was mediocre but I wanted to try it out and won't be coming back.<//text>

We visited on a Saturday afternoon at 12.30spm and waited until about 1.30 to be seated. Be sure to sit outside if it's a nice day, definitely worth it. Whole-wheat pancakes were yummy, as were country potatoes. Hubby liked the burger. Staff were friendly but closed right on time - 2.15pm.</Review>< Date>

We got the scrambled eggs and egg benedict, both were great! I am sure I will try the French toast next time! Their special muffin (buttermilk tangerine muffin) was just amazing. Super light and tangy; and went great with coffee! Good coffee as well!

Would highly recommend for a calm and chill brunch or evening coffee or bite!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQj2LASbN4TOLTyzCA0sMHSKsXLU8mO7oYebHX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

<Text>EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE
We were treated to wonderful service and excellent food this morning. The unhurried, friendly atmosphere made for an unforgettable (in a good way) breakfast. The Salmon Benedict was delicious and the hash browns were prepared as ordered- extra crispy. I’m looking forward to our next visit.</Text>< Pics>

I love having brunch here and have been here a few times!
I always got the Smoked Salmon Egg Benedicts with hash brown and they come with seasonal and colorful fruit on the side.
Excellent services with friendly staff, a very nice place for Brunch :)< /review>

This place is popular. I came on a day where it was rainy, and people were still lined up to go! They had heaters out which was nice. Wait wasn't long at all. Food was great! I had a shrimp and crab scramble :)< /Review>

Came here on a Thursday noon and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for 2!

Food: I had gone for an open faced breakfast sandwich and boy was it huge! I was pleasantly surprised how large the whole portion was, each face was like a meal and the hash browns were really well done and crispy!

Service: Food actually came quite quickly in 10 minutes or so! The waiters didn’t check on us too often but refilled our waters occasionally.

Ambiance: Classy brunch location! Pretty casual but still classy.

Overall, a standard brunch restaurant with decent prices and good portions!<//text>

<review>Quality of food is good but it's a bit overpriced for their portion size. The person who was refilling coffee came to our table to offer a refill when we were signing the check and were about to leave.< /review>< Pics>

Very good food and service. The wait was a bit long but expected for 8 people on Saturday morning. We waited about 45 mins but worth the wait. They won't seat you until all people in the party are there. And they don't take reservations as expected. Quite busy place. Try the Mexican scramble!< /Text>

<Review>Good service, nice atmosphere, and LOTS of coffee refills. Definitely got my caffeine fix for the day.

Got the smoked salmon egg benedict and it was delicious! Loved to see that fresh fruit is included with the home fries. Friend got the beef hash which looked amazing. Would like to come back sometime.< /Review><Response>None</Response>< Date>

<text>We came here on a Saturday at around 1.30pm for brunch and it was quite packed. We had to wait but the wait went quick. We sat outside which was nice because they have heaters.

We got the goat cheese ommlette and the Mexican scramble with hash browns. Both were excellent! I particularly loved the goat cheese ommlette.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOslzgqgyApT-rSJy8SGstta3I6DQMZTDi3J7BQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN48zvpiC-SSB2dBiMTG05n0TpL6sk00YSZOqTV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLcK11m3HPfF_p9f4PEUzpYWNajaGhpW1qLXD9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDcdiICBrr1jo63L6kZ2Hy87sam3j9hdMH_yw9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Came early in the morning to try out their corned beef with hash browns. I believe I read on the menu that the corner beef was made in-house as well as their hash browns. When I order corned beef hash, I like to order it with sunny side eggs and mix it in with the hash browns and corned beef. Once mixed in, I eat it on top of the toast. Honestly, everything was great and I think it was the best breakfast spot I've experienced during my time in Palo Alto.< /Text><GmapID>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5<//GmapID>< user_id>

The restaurant is tiny and often has a wait on Friday mornings around 9am. Today we were lucky and were seated right away.
The eggs were nicely done (over hard as I requested). The bacon comes a little more cooked than I usually prefer but still tasty.

I always have to request extra butter for my toast but the bread is really nice and fluffy.

The hash browns are awesome and come with onions and little diced red peppers.

Overall I like this place and it's service.</review>

<review>. Salad was fresh although the chicken seemed to have been prepared ahead of ordered. It was warm at best.. Burger was good but French fries were barely warm. Our fountain drinks were flat, fresh drinks were brought out but they were not much better, and were removed fro our bill. Hopefully this items can easily be corrected for future customers. Wait persons were very attentive.< /review><gmapID>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5< /gmapID>< username>

My sister and I chose this place because it was our aunt's name. We were very glad we did. The outdoor seating was lovely.
The menu selection made it hard to choose! Everything we ordered was delicious. My sister had a latte, and said it was the best she'd ever had. The food was fresh and delicious. The prices weren't horrible.
Overall a very good choice!</text>

I ordered crepe complete ( Two scramabled eggs,Swiss feta cheddar cheese served with seasonal fruits) the portions was big and I finished with difficulty.  Fruits were generous in number .
Other people  ordered Hauvenos Santa fe, Goat cheese omelette, cherries french toast and orange Juice ,coffee and cappuccino.  Orange juice was yummy. All items were served sliced fruit, choice of hash browns or home fries.

The service was good and the food ahs big portions and generous sliced fruit and tasty was  very good<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1nb3se1iW0s7Jbju75bZvLGjJdxm2VmfZ8_br=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQtKEzaFhB5c0wsgKljIIPMOghhAuOxOD_xPSZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2l_SUj84ai_6izGtdg2BShgWBtz1cRwnsSn2f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuBLfKmKluzN8Mg0a-1WIK-DaDQfYAEWrlIoUY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8bS6QwandOgDM_4vT6E5TjxSWQRm3QX_AXVbz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBDiycLCkM1S2j4NCVmUFacVR5Z-l27bzBrS3A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

It was a solid restaurant. Staff was friendly and service was fast. My breakfast was nice, but not terribly memorable. I wish the flavors were a bit stronger. It seems some elements were toned down to be more palatable for a wider audience, but still measures of quality such as how the egg was cooked, plating, and ingredient ratios were all on point.<//Text>

< Review>
You can smell the yummy goodness of what's in store for you long before you reach the door. Met a friend there for breakfast. We picked it based on Yelp reviews. In spite of the extensive, varied menu, I knew what I wanted as soon as I saw it: they had me at "goat cheese omelet". She ordered the smoked salmon omelette. Both were hearty proportions, and came with a choice of fruit or potatoes AND choice of toast or banana muffin. I think the highlight of the meal was the shredded- style hash browns. Total comfort food. Muffin was so-so... kind of dry and a little over baked, I thought.  I bake so I am really picky. My friend liked it, though. Place had a nice homey feel, and I was glad we were there early because it got busy later and there was a line to get in as we were leaving. They didn't pressure us to leave and we were able to sit and visit. On a nicer day, they have a nice outside area in front which is also good for people watching on the main California St. drag. Overall a great experience and I will definitely be back.<//Review>

<Text>Absolutely love this place. Food quality and quantity is great. I’m always super full after going there.
On weekends you’ll definitely need to wait a while to get a table. But if you’re party of two, you’ll get seated within 10-15 mins.
Their staff are always friendly and attentive.<//Text><GmapID>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice little breakfast/lunch Cafe, with pretty wide selection to choose from. Staff is extraordinairely friendly, and definitely makes the atmosphere here worth coming back to. If that doesn't do it for you the food definitely will. We all ordered something relatively different and all the dishes came out perfectly. There's also a nice outdoor dining area, that is great after a nice hike. I couldn't really find anything to complain about to be honest, service was fast, all the servers constantly checked on you to make sure you have water and coffee, and checked on our food several times to make sure that it was up to our par. Most importantly, what you come here for, the food was great. If you're in the area, come try it out.<//review>

<Text>Great american food,   We went for brunch.  Inside the restaurant is noisy.  Outside seating is available and was better for our group.   Lotʻs of children and families.   Outside seating is best for wheelchairs just because there is more space .

The hash browns were amazing, a nice combination between crispy and soft! The coffee was a little bitter though. Overall, a good breakfast place, but I'm trying to understand why it is rated #1 breakfast place in Palo Alto...<//review>

<Text>Very popular spot for brunch!  Serving sizes are good, staff is friendly, put your name on the list and wait!  Your whole group does need to be present to be seated.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating, food comes out quickly, staff is friendly!  Would go back, just have to be patient in line</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was pleasantly surprised. Never heard of the place. It was spotless and the  food and service where outstanding. In an area with fusion, tai, vegan etc it was nice to have a tasty steak and egg breakfast. We will definitely go out of our way to eat there again. Bravo.</review>

<review>I'm not totally sure what happened, I think maybe the cap for the salt came off when they were making my food, so my experience may not be characteristic. The potatoes were almost inedible, though I was hungry, so ultimately edible. The place has a nice vibe though it has apparently achieved the network effect of brunch places where you need to hang around for awhile before being seated (I am still not sure the mechanism behind this effect, it does not seem to be related to the quality of the place, but more the "coolness" or "transmission of desirability"? Still trying to figure this out, it may need more focused study). Not sure I need to go back here, though I always catch a bit of uplifting energy as I walk by on California street heading somewhere else.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Atmosphere was totally Palo Alto.  This is a place where busy friends meet to catch up on life while enjoying a meal together.  We had the breakfast.  We had barely sat down and ordered when the food arrived almost instantly.  I had french toast with potatoes and eggs.  The eggs were hot and made to order.  The potatoes were made at least several hours ahead and had been sitting in oils and arrived barely warm.  The french toast would have been fantastic if made fresh instead of in a batch kept under a warmer.  I like the plate and food to be hot.  The clientele here seemed pleased with mediocre food.  The burgers looked much better than the breakfast.  They were hot off the grill and people were devouring the fries so they must be good.  At a cafe with Palo Alto pricing, I expected a homestyle straight off the grill hot meal.  I was sadly disappointed.  Forgot...the servers were fantastic.<//text>< pics>

It was a lovely place to have a nice breakfast. Definitely a change of pace. When I arrived a quarter to 9 in the morning it was nearly empty and very quiet. Within minutes the place was filled. I got there just in time to get my order quickly. The Omelette was delicious. It was goat cheese and artichoke hearts. Such a beautiful combination that I would have never thought of.< /review>

Joanie’s Cafe is a good choice for some reliable if unexciting comfort food. The service is friendly and fast, the food is reasonable and you’ll be neither disappointed nor delighted. If you’re in the mood for some quick and mediocre comfort food then this is the spot for you; if you’re looking to satiate the more adventurous foodie in you then this may not hit the mark.<//Review>

Super large portions and good service but the food is not great.
No organic ingredients. Poor coffee. My kids did not like the pancakes as the butter and syrup tasted odd to them. My salmon crepe upset my stomach.
Not recommended.<//text>

Joanie's Cafe is such a nice place to have breakfast/brunch at! It has a homey vibe, seating indoors and out. The servers and staff were all very kind during my visit. It was a very comfortable environment.

I ordered the eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon, came with fresh fruit and my choice of hashbrown over fries. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo omelette with his choice of hashbrown and sourdough toast. I honestly loved my dish, the crunch and crispiness of the hashbrown the fresh fruit selection didn't go bad. And the main star of the dish, the smoked salmon benedict, had a very nice runny yolk and the sauce was light. I usually never had smoked salmon with my eggs benedict, so it was a nice change to my usual!

I'm never in the Palo Alto area, but if I'm back and want brunch then I'd definitely come back!< /Review>

What can I say, the sandwich I had was fantastic.  I  can't wait to go back.  Parking is difficult, so plan extra time for that.  I can't wait to go back and try some other sandwiches.  They also have some very interesting combinations I haven't seen other places.< /text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>I came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast around 9:15AM, and the place was packed! Even though I came by myself, I still had to wait about 10 minutes. It was worth it though! I ordered the French toast, and the food came out quite quickly. I'm not sure whether I ordered the wrong item but it didn't have berries like I wanted; there was an array of other fruits which was fine but I would've preferred the berries. Anyway, the French toast was really soft and it was delicious. I really enjoyed the meal a lot! The service here isn't great because it's a bit overrun; it took me a while to get my order taken and for the check to get handed to me. If you're not in a rush, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>A very cute cafe with great service and good tasty food. We went for brunch on a reasonably warm spring Saturday morning. There was a reasonable amount of wait to get a table and we decided to sit outside. The tower heaters provided a nice touch to keep us warm with the unpredictable bay area weather.

Food was delicious and service was attentive. What is brunch if not for having a few good mimosas. They all are tasty! Highly recommend this restaurant for people watching , tasty food, and it's attentive service!<//Review>< Resp>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I cannot say enough about Joanie’s Cafe. It was the most wonderful discovery! The dishes were outstanding and so beautifully displayed. The ambiance was charming and the service first class. The best part was that they were not out to make political statements and we were offered biodegradable/compostable straws and we were not assessed a surcharge. We have stopped patronizing restaurants that add the 5%+ surcharge and make us feel like scum when we ask for a compostable straw. We love this place and will definitely return as well as spread the word!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>We were looking for a traditional breakfast while we were staying in Palo Alto, and we stumbled upon Joanie’s Cafe at 405 California Ave, just a block off El Camino. The staff were delightful and the food was everything we’d were wanting. My corned beef has was made in house and delicious, and unlike at most breakfast joints, my wife’s poached eggs were just right. But the best tell that this is a terrific place is that every local we told about our breakfast said, “Oh, Joanie’s? That’s where we go for breakfast! We love it!”</text>< UserId.>

<Text>THE best brunch place I've been to in the Bay Area. The brunch food and service are both amazing. My favorite things to get here are the eggs benedicts. The line during brunch/lunchtime on weekends can get a bit long. I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday, and we waited about 50 minutes before we got seated. I've also gone there about half an hour before they closed on the weekend, and there wasn't much of a wait. Either way, it's worth it.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5<//Gmap_id></record>

Big portion for the proce, making it an excellent brunch spot. Hashbrowns were good without ketchup and the crepe I got was so good I cleaned the plate. I just wish they had more options without pork products, but the fish was fine and the veggie options sounded excellent too. Would go back to impress others.<//Review>

<review>Had a great time trying this place out for the first time. I had the Smoked Salmon Omelet with homefries and blueberry muffin. It was delicious! Tried the Pineapple and pomegranate syrup mimosa too. The service was great, and I swear they hire ninjas with the way the servers always came out of nowhere to fill up our waters. Even during a busy Sunday morning they were always aware of their customers. Delicious food and amazing service, I would definitely recommend.< /review>< rating>

As far as breakfast places go, Joanie's is a solid and safe choice for a great start to your morning. While there is usually a long wait on the weekends (especially on Sunday with the farmers market outside), it's worth it. I generally go with a make-your-own omelet, but have also ventured into their pancakes and waffles.</Review>

<review>I was here for brunch but couldn’t
secure a seat early enough due to the long wait time.

I was too starved to wait another 30 minutes so        had to move to the next available restaurant.

However, my brief interaction with the waitress was warm, friendly and the coffee was good.

On my next visit, I’ll factor in the wait and expect to be served something delicious.< /review>< Pictures>

Reliably good food in a cozy neighborhood cafe.  Prices in line with the local area, but that's a bit higher than for a comparable cafe in most other Bay Area suburbs.  Attentive and very pleasant staff.< /text>

Delightful brunch place in Mountain View. Amazing pancakes, frittatas and omelettes. Highly recommend you visit and if necessary wait for a table. Very worth your time. The staff are super friendly and helpful in recommending their best creations.<//Text>

Yummy breakfast. I like the bustling atmosphere and the friendly service at Joanie's. Try the French Toast. My wife orders it with a side of bacon. I almost always have a scramble or omelet. There is usually a wait on weekends, but they have benches and outdoor heaters in winter.<//Review>

This place is great! We had the berry marcapone French toast and it was magical. We also had the veggie scramble and house potatoes which were both so tasty! Even the housemade peach muffin was fantastic. Will return again and again.< /text>

I live in a rural part of CA, so the pricing was a bit high than would a typical diner breakfast be for me, but the meal was excellent.  I had the chorizo omelette w/ home fries and toast.  A bit spicier would have been nice, but it was otherwise a generous and well prepared ommy.  Late on Friday morning, there was around a 20 minute wait, but the service was fast and accurate.  Don't know if/when I'll be able to go again, but Joanie's is on my go to list, situation permitting.< /review>

<Review>We have been here 2 times already. The food has been always very good. Wide selection and delicious. What we didn't like each time was the service. They treated us without any attention. Did not even look at us when we were ordering food with her and did not check on us regularly. I understand that sometimes, after a long day, you do not want to engage with people. I am sure it is not normal for this place, but it happened to us each time, unfortunately.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

But this one wasn’t one that we enjoyed. Customer service was good but the Food was overpriced and mediocre. The breakfast was nothing special or stood out. The portions were ok for the price.

I went to Joanie's early in the morning, so there was plenty of room, but the place filled up quickly. I ordered crepes and granola, but the portions are huge, so I left quite a bit on the plate. The granola was simply delicious. The crepes less so, but they were good. The coffee was also good.

The waiters seemed a bit confused and inexperienced, but they were still nice.</Review>

We arrived at the peak of the brunch rush, and it was about a 30-40 minute wait to get a spot at the counter.  If you wanted a table then it may be a longer wait.
Service was courteous and efficient.  Decor is pleasant and bright.
The food was very very decent brunch food.  The omelet was well-cooked with lots of fresh ingredients; eggs and corned beef hash were both solid.  The Belgian waffle was a bit more chewy than my liking.  The hash browns were definitely the highlight - crispy on both sides, and well-seasoned.
We'd probably come back again, but next time we'll get here either earlier or later to avoid the brunch crunch.< /Review>

Nice breakfast place in Palo Alto. Either try the freshly squeezed orange 🍊 juice or the mimosa’s. The menu has variety of options for veggie lovers as well.</Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>I went to Joanie's early in the morning, so there was plenty of room, but the place filled up quickly. I ordered crepes and granola, but the portions are huge, so I left quite a bit on the plate. The granola was simply delicious. The crepes less so, but they were good. The coffee was also good.

The waiters seemed a bit confused and inexperienced, but they were still nice.< /text>< Pics>

<text>We arrived at the peak of the brunch rush, and it was about a 30-40 minute wait to get a spot at the counter.  If you wanted a table then it may be a longer wait.
Service was courteous and efficient.  Decor is pleasant and bright.
The food was very very decent brunch food.  The omelet was well-cooked with lots of fresh ingredients; eggs and corned beef hash were both solid.  The Belgian waffle was a bit more chewy than my liking.  The hash browns were definitely the highlight - crispy on both sides, and well-seasoned.
We'd probably come back again, but next time we'll get here either earlier or later to avoid the brunch crunch.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

Super fun place for brunch and lunch on the weekends. It is always crowded and the people here are so friendly. Joanie's is really a treasure in Palo Alto and is loved by so many locals. I recommend the salads but all of the food is good.< /Review>

I have been there many many many times for the offer two years so service is great. My favorite is their hash brown. Second is their feta omelette because of the crispy bacon bites in the egg, yummm. It us bet favorful already so I usually ask for no feta on the omelette. Their options are huge and good to split and share.< /review>

A nice cafe downtown Palo Alto. Food was good, I had some breakfast eggs (omlette) . The food was ok , nothing special the service was good too. It was really crowded so make sure u can accommodate waiting time. It is a tad expensive compared to other diners.one weird thing was that food was a little cold by the time it came in.<//Review>

Great food, decent mimosas -- they let you choose what type of juice to mix with your champagne. Not the best service though to be honest. No, the servers weren't rude or anything, but it took a while to flag someone down to put in our order, get the check, etc.</text>

We came here for lunch. The service was nice. The food super greasy. I couldn't finish my sandwich because it was so soaked in fat. It was really yummy and it was probably olive oil but it was just too greasy for me. But besides that the food is good. My husband was happy with his burger.</text>

I had the Santa Fe burrito and my wife had the granola and the Mexican Dash.  Both were excellent, we will definitely be coming here again.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<review>It was very average, food looks good in photos but really lacks in flavors. The corned beef hash was the best part though, that was good< /review>< Gmap_id>

Waited in line for 70 minutes with my kids, only to have the hostess seat a table that arrived 15 minutes after us because, 'they are running late for something' and asked if they could be seated. When I asked why we were skipped, I got a glare, a rude answer, and decided to skip this BASIC spot. There's nothing special about the food here.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Not by coincidence voted as best breakfast place, we waited for an hour and it was worth it! Super friendly and quick service, food tasty (had salmon benedicts) with fair portions. Nice vibe, good location, you can check farmers market on Sunday mornings.

Only surprise was $5.4 for 4 pieces of side bacon.<//text>

Great cafe, good service.  I get the steak and eggs or the steak frites almost every time.  But my friends live the omelettes and other breakfast items too.   Service is always friendly.  Gets busy and you can wait for a table at peak hours.<//review>

Love the waffles they serve @ brunch although expect a pretty substantial wait on the weekend.  They also have delicious dinners-even breakfast for dinner, which is awesome.  The owner is also very friendly.< /Text>

I just spent $24 on tea, omlette, and a chicken apple sausage. The tea was great, the rest mediocre. Ordered the feta omlette. The bacon was burnt inside,  overall taste even disregarding the bacon issue was bland. I asked for salsa hoping to salvage it, obviously was salsa from a jar. The sausage was awful both in taste and was overcooked. Two stars for pleasant atmosphere and decent servers.</text>

<text>I feel bad because this place is really cute and the wait-staff is nice.  But, I think the food is pretty bad.  We had the pancakes, which tasted like bisquick.  We had the more expensive brioche french toast, and I swear it tasted like anti-stick spray for a griddle.  There wasn't much else taste to it than that.  After adding syrup (which I'm pretty sure wasn't even maple) it was edible.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Joanie's is a favorite neighborhood destination.  It's a great place to go for a basic bacon and eggs breakfast, but they also have terrific breakfast specials, omelets and scrambles, and oatmeal.  If you have the choice between toast or muffin, try the muffin, they are delicious, baked daily with fresh fruit.  Yum!< /Review>

Went here on a sunny afternoon. I ordered the Fettuccine Carbonara which was good but was a bit bland. Nothing in particular was wrong with the experience, but it was just average - thus the average rating (3 of 5 stars).< /review>

<Review>One of my favorite places for breakfast in Palo Alto. I've been there many times and food was always very tasty. I like their Crêpe Bretonne, Eggs Benedict, various omelettes. Hash browns are better than usual.
The only negative thing is *huge* waiting lines on weekends.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Waited for a table on Sunday at a busy time. Put name on waitlist. Waited 50 minutes. 5th member of our party was walking to place.  Would not sit the 4 present of the 5.  Gave away our table.  Ridiculous customer service at the entrance. Cannot seat 4 of party of 5 when 5th is walking here.<//text>

We went there for brunch, and all of the food we had was good to very good: Eggs Benedict, blueberry muffin, bacon, corned beef hash, and hashed browns. The exception were the scrambled eggs, which were dry and flavorless (maybe they use liquid eggs, yuck). The drinks were excellent. They served my wife's Americano as an espresso with pitchers of hot water and hot (!) cream so she could doctor it to her own satisfaction, something that we've never seen before and hope becomes a trend. They served my Mimosa with the remainder of a split of Blanc de Noir and a little pitcher of orange juice, so I was able to get something like three helpings out of it. And the service was excellent. Warning: portions are large. A very solid brunch option!</text>

(Translated by Google) It's always very crowded from the morning! They will line up, so we recommend that you go early!

The French toast is quite voluminous, but it was delicious without being too sweet!

いつも朝からとても混んでいます！並ぶので、早めに行くことをおすすめします！

フレンチトーストはかなりのボリュームですが、甘すぎずおいしかったです！</Text>

You have to wait, but the taste of the food is enough to compensate. Especially for tourists, it is a place not to be regretted to go to and eat. It is not exactly what is happening in front of the store, but it is supposed to be held on Sundays and it is a good spectacle.

(Original)
미국식 아침을 제대로 먹을 수 있는 곳이다. 기다려야하지만 음식맛으로 충분히 보상이 된다. 특히 여행객에게는 찾아가서 먹는 수고를 해도 후회되지 않는 곳이다. 가게앞에 시골장이 열리는데  정확하지는 않지만 일요일이어서 열리는 것으로 추측되는데 좋은 구경거리이다.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Absolutely incredible! We came here for breakfast and were surprised by the incredible service, space and food. The place has indoor and outdoor space. Although large, the number of people is so great that you may have to wait a little while to sit down. Regarding the menu, we went for breakfast so we only focused on these options, which are already very diverse! Prices are around $ 15. Here you can order from pancakes to eggs. Very nice and wonderful space!

Absolutamente incrivel! Viemos aqui para tomar o pequeno-almoço e fomos surpreendidos por um serviço, espaço e comida incriveis. O local tem espaço interior e exterior. Apesar de amplo, a quantidade de pessoas é tanta que pode ter de ficar a espera um pouco para sentar. Relativamente à carta, fomos para pequeno-almoço por isso só nos focámos nestas opções que já são muito diversas! Os preços rondam os 15 dólares. Aqui pode pedir desde panquecas a ovos. Muito bom e maravilhoso espaço!</Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) I came to know it by chance last year and I am going really often afterwards. If it is not delicious, it is enough to be able to say that it is responsible. Omelets and Benedict are recommended.
