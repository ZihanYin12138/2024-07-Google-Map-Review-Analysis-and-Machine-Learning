<rating>3<//rating><text>Tried out the spin class and revisited gym amenities with some friends today.

About 10 years ago I was a member of the gym, and it seemed like a couple amenities and simple layout options got worse, but could just be my memory! It was very challenging to find a water fountain even with people directing to go upstairs couldn't locate and gave up and filled waterbottle in the bathroom. Could also not find towels or towel drop; the spin instructor gave out a few but they were more like dish rags than towels and still couldn't find where to leave it after. Staff was all very friendly and engaging, but those little things for a new person at the gym we're frustrating.

The spin room is pretty small but efficient and everyone was high energy. Bikes do have clip pedal options and are all adjustable. The Instructor didn't have a mic so was a little hard to understand over the music, but I was able to follow along for a pretty intense butt-kicking workout. Lots of focus on core and sprints, not as much focus feeling the beat and rythm amd balance as I've experienced in other classes.

After the workout I tried a smoothie from the Acai Project attached to the gym, also saw their acai bowls that looked great. I ordered the protein smoothie that had great flavor but was a little sweet. I was hoping to find out nutrition and calorie information but hasn't been easily accessible to find and isn't listed on their website yet.

Not a bad gym option for consistent class offerings, lots of weights and machines upstairs, and of course flexible hours always great.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5flRqfB8rk9uRU-iGNXaFU1VKiHnat2CzKGNJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>The gym itself is fine... pretty typical, good equipment and friendly staff. However the billing/membership is set up through a third party and is a total pain!  The process to cancel was kind of ridiculous, which I wish I would have known when I signed up- not being able to communicate payments/membership with the actual club is a no go for me.</Review>< username>

This is the worst gym i have ever stepped foot in they literally cheated me out of my money and told me i couldnt even get a tour of the gym unless i signed up for a memebership. I told the staff lady if i sign up i only want it for one month because i dont know if id like it and i dont want any long term obligations she said okay and then why 3 months later im getting emails saying i owe $74 dollars every month for the next 9 months ????? I called they wont get me in contact with a manager, i go up there they say the manager isnt there, and theyre emailing me documents of membership signatures that ARENT EVEN MINE!! DO NOT GET A MEMEBERSHIP FROM HERE! They are such bad business and if they make a mistakes they try to make you pay for their mistakes. I should have never stepped foot in this place 😡< /text>

<Review>It’s an OK gym. My biggest complaint is their lack of transparency about the random hidden fees. I was lied to on the phone about the structure of their memberships just to get me through the door.

They easily sign you up and take your money but good luck trying to cancel or modify your account.

My advice: Sign on if you never plan to leave and have lots of money to throw at them.

Update:  took off another star. They froze my account without my consent to extend my contract through the COVID crisis. My options are paying another four months or pay their cancellation fee. Even in the wake of a pandemic, they will find ways rip you off.

Im filing with the BBB. This place is ridiculous.<//Review><GmapID>0x80ecf0520d608c99:0x57780f4fc4f80f77</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Seriously stay away from this place, their cancellation fee is insane. I found a better gym membership at Kennedy and a way friendlier staff there too and when I wanted to cancel the owner got very angry and defensive and charged me a cancellation fee even though I followed policy. read all the other reviews and stay away!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Overpriced for what they offer. Most difficult membership cancelling experience ever. Make sure you read all the fine print on the contract and take pictures of it so you don't get ripped off. There are a lot of random fees and they will steal your money without blinking. Other gyms in SLO are cheaper and offer more ie Kennedy and Cal Poly</Review>

<text>Edit: would change to a 3 star not because of the gym but the amount of creeps there. It’s very hard to feel comfortable. The staff is downstairs which creates this separation and leaves gym goers on their own upstairs. Would like some staff members present upstairs to keep the creepers out or so they don’t openly creep. Also wipes that contain alcohol to really sterilize, and the hand sanitizer has been empty for 2 years.<//text>< Response>

Incredibly clean. Great variety of equipment. Never busy, even during peak times (if you’ve been to an Equinox at 6pm, trust that you’ll never have that experience here). Spin classes and CrossFit studios available with pretty regular classes. Facility is split over two levels: downstairs are locker rooms (bring your own lock) with showers, separate two-story CrossFit studio, and a large studio with squat racks and kickboxing bags; upstairs is an open floor with cardio equipment including treadmills, elliptical as, and stair machines (all facing TVs), free weights and benches, and a ton of equipment (yes, even for legs!). Bring your own towel. Friendly staff and plenty of parking, with cafes and markets within 10-50 feet of the entrance, though try an açaí bowl at the bar downstairs. Have been a member for nearly 3 years and I’m so grateful a facility like this exists in “small town” San Luis Obispo. My only wish is that you could scan your membership barcode with an iPhone app instead of a physical tag, but that’s an incredibly minor caveat.< /Review>

I called Club 24 today 8/13 1:30pm) and I asked if I could buy a membership so that I could come and take showers for a couple of days. My Father is in Hospice and I've been staying with him 24 hours a day.  I asked if I could buy day passes. The girl on the phone told me that I could NOT do that because I wasn't going to work out...couldn't make this up if I tried! I asked if they offered a monthly pass (even though my Father might not make it through the night). She told me that it was $99.00, but that she would "get in trouble" for selling me one because I wasn't going to work out. I asked to speak to a Manager and she put me on hold until I finally hung up. This is THE WORST BUSINESS that I have ever encountered. Hopefully this review is read BEFORE you spend a dime at this facility. This is absolutely unconscionable.<//review>

this gym is never too crowded and the staff is friendly. Frank, who I presume the owner, is always happy to help and give tips. most reviews on here seem to reflect negatively on the cancellation fees and renovation fees charged November. if you read the contract this is all outlined! people leaving bad ratings because they are too dull to read a contract they sign whilst signing up for the gym.<//review>

My husband went a lot at first and then found it difficult in his schedule to go to the gym.  He hand;t been for months when we decided to cancel the membership- plus we had moved to the other side of town.  Not only did we have to pay the yearly maintenance fee, but we didn't time it right with the billing cycles so we are being charged another month.  I repeat, he hasn't been in quite some time.
To maintain good customer service as a locally owned company it would behoove the managers to allow a hard working family to cancel membership in a more compassionate, user friendly way.  Less money tp send on our kids at Christmas.  Did they find any heart to help us out? No.  Would not recommend.
What is the deal with gyms?< /Text>

Terrible customer service

My 86- year-old Dad moved to SLO and joined.   He was told, after paying his enrollment and first months fees that a trainer would call to set up an initial visit.  While he was eager to get started, it took 10 days, which he was paying for, before he got a call from the trainer.  Because the facility was being remodeled, there were now locker rooms, or lockers available and he had to change in the bathroom, but no discount was offered on his membership.   After five weeks, he decided this wasn’t going to work for him, and said he wanted to quit.  Despite the fact that he had a month-to-month membership, which did not have a termination fee, he was charged a termination fee of $125.00 what a colossal rip off.< /text>

<Text>I really would love to give this gym 5 stars but I just can’t. Well long story short I decided to cancel my membership because I just wasn’t going consistently. When I signed up I asked about any fees. I was told there was a 1x a year maintenence fee which I get.  Well I called to cancel and was told not only do I have to pay the $50 a month (because you need a written 30 day notice to cancel) I had to pay a freakin $30 cancellation fee! I have no idea why I would have to pay a fee to cancel when my required membership was 6 months and it was past that! I do not feel like that was properly communicated at alllll. I contemplated keeping my membership for the classes but after that there is no way I will go back there. Huge bummer as the gym and equipment are pretty nice!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

As others have said, the enrollment fee is excessive at $130, plus the "equipment upgrade fee" in November for another $30. I went to the gym for a few months. The air was stuffy and hot - it is a gym, but it seemed excessive. About half the treadmills and bikes were either broken or too clunky to operate. After going in to cancel my membership, I was told I would be charged for the current month ($42), an additional month ($42), plus the equipment upgrade fee for next year ($30).

Fees are excessive to both join and cancel, no ventilation, and equipment was sub par.</Text>

Don't bother. The owner is not friendly. And, there's a fat guy who works here who thinks he knows everything also when he probably cannot even do 10 pushups in a row. Most important, it's way overpriced, hot and stuffy. No thanks.</Review>

< review>
NEGATIVE stars if google would let me.  I haven't been to the gym since last year and I am still getting bills in the mail.  Be prepared to for a huge PITA when trying to cancel or freeze your membership.  Tip - use a credit card that is expiring the same time you want your membership to end, other you will have to cancel that credit card.<//review>

I read the negative customer service reviews and just called to give them the benefit of the doubt. I am an executive here on business, and lift in local gyms eveywhere I go. I called to ask details about working out in the morning, and was told visitors can only workout from 9am - 9pm by "Megan". When I shared I would need to workout earlier she shared its policy and apologized. When I asked to speak with a manager she shared they had all gone home. This is definitely a poorly managed operation, that is not interested in earning money, new / return business, or postive feed back. If a gym is this ignorant in their business practices I wouldn't step foot in the door to jump rope - which of course probably has some rediculous stipulation. I'll take my business elsewhere, and direct all of my colleagues and others to a professionally ran gym with realistic hours for all.<//Text>

<text>This gym has the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.  I paid the first and last month dues with the initiation fee almost 2 years ago and have paid monthly since then.  Now it's our last month and the know it all Manager, Sanaz says we didn't give her enough time to cancel the membership (we only gave 30 days and they need 45) so the last month needs to be paid for AGAIN.  Stay away from this gym and don't give them any credit card info.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

<review>The volunteers and staff are wonderful. My issues always happen during closed hours (of course, that’s how my life goes) and someone has always called me back immediately upon their business opening. Their advice has been perfect each time: first about a bird nest with babies built over my front door (new build and I’d closed on house to discover birds had set up housekeeping ahead of me), next an injured bird, and today a very small fawn with no mom around for a couple of hours. Thanks for helping this beach and city girl learn to coexist with oak forest creatures. You are amazing!< /review><Date>1624297026343<//Date>< pictures>

<Text>I have volunteered at Pacific Wildlife Care for 3 years and it's a very rewarding way to spend my winters! I have made some very dear friends and feel that I have contributed to the well-being of a slew of critters. There are many opportunities to learn and there are volunteer options for all levels of mental and physical abilities. It's not perfect for everyone but it's an amazing opportunity for those that are willing to put in a few hours to help the wildlife of San Luis Obispo County.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

< review>
I am so impressed and grateful for this organization.  a volunteer got back to me immediately, sent me a link about opposums and referred me to the opposum expert who has helped me for the last 2 weeks . she came to my house twice, loaned me a camera, trap, carrier, leather gloves and talked me through removing the first baby from the trap and putting it in the carrier. so far I have caught 3 more and delivered all to her house.  we determined they were orphans and wanted them to be relocated to a safer environment when they are a little bigger.  the experience has motivated me to donate to this wonderful organization with such caring and dedicated people.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Like the review from a couple of years ago, we had a terrible experience with the staff.  After rescuing a gull with a broken wing from the beach (where we are currently under a high surf warning), we put the bird in a box as instructed by the recording on their message line.  We were in a location of some risk and just packaged the bird, which was showing signs of shock, exhaustion, and likely dehydration, stopping to take no pictures.

We drove over 30 minutes one-way, and after taking one picture on the way inside with the box, we asked the volunteer if we could take a picture of the bird itself.  She was SO nasty!  She said "You were taking pictures out there as I came in!", refuting our statement that we had taken no pictures (argumentative), and followed up with "The time to have done that was when you put it in the box!!".  She did not, I guess, think about the fact that we may have endangered ourselves to save the bird, nor that we had hurried with it to what we thought a safe place, as soon as we possibly could.

I have experience as a Veterinary Tech Assistant, and an incomplete application to volunteer at this center.  I will NEVER assist an organization that keeps staff who hate what they do, and there is no other explanation for how that woman treated us!  Her demeanor and attitude clearly and loudly said that we were not welcome.  One can only hope that she finds *something* to do with herself that makes her a nicer person, lest she , and her affluent free time be all there is in the end.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1480463797956, 'text': 'Really sorry, Lisa, you had such a bad experience!  I was able to learn which volunteer, not staff member, you saw because she admitted the interaction with you had not gone as well.  My opinion, and it is only that, as I was not there, is that when we have problems at the receiving desk it is usually the result of both parties coming together as strangers at a very emotional moment.  Then it sometimes leads to major misunderstandings, and hurt feelings, precisely because  both parties are both so focused on the animal in question.  I am guessing you were focused on the whole experience of rescuing the bird, and how emotional it all was, and how much you cared about it, and remembering and documenting your success, especially if it was difficult or even scary, and in feeling happy to finally get it to a safe place.  The person receiving the animal is focused on getting that animal back to the veterinarian, or other staff as quickly as possible so care can be given right away. They are trained to be aware of how traumatic any wildlife interaction with humans can be, or if not, how it might contribute to taming that animal, making it vulnerable to humans without your feeling for wildlife, once it is released back to the wild, if it can be.  It might seem to be easy to train people who volunteer at our front desk to be more careful with the people they interact with than the animals, but unfortunately, it is not always that easy with those who are really dedicated to wildlife.  Not sure this possible explanation of how you and the person you saw that day were feeling, and thinking, but I hate to think you retain such a poor opinion of our organization, as we do try awfully hard to do things the best as we can for wildlife, but we are for sure less than perfect.  We are sorry your experience was way less than that.'}< /response>< gmap_id>

I called in on a beached oiled Western Grebe and the volunteer called me right back. She checked to see if I wanted to attempt the rescue myself and walked me through it. When it was unsuccessful she notified  their volunteers to follow up. They went out with a net and were unable to catch. The following day I again called it in and they sent another person with a net to meet me. We again could not catch the bird. When I mentioned a possible kayak approach she called another volunteer who met me later in the day with her 2 kayaks and an additional volunteer with a net on land. We were still unable to catch the bird. This Grebe will be monitored and further attempts will be made. This is an extradinary response and they do this all year long, year after year. It gives one hope for humanity.

Steer Clear.  We have called, use this place 3 times over the last few years, each time the staff was rude, condescending, insulting.  The only reason we went back is you don't want to judge an organization based on one employee.  This time actually went there and it was a horrific experience.  There has to be something better then this pitiful organization.<//Review>

It takes a village to help save wildlife - many citizens enjoy seeing our wildlife here in SLO County and they help out by noticing and bringing in animals to our licensed organization to be cared for by staff, volunteers & our vet.  Sometimes humans are the cause of the injury (ex. our cats, our cars, our windows reflecting trees, etc.) so we feel we should do all we can to help them out.

Some workers have become more grouchy twored customers lately. I understand when you have a bad day or situation but please don't take it out on other customers. First money was slapped down and shoved at me the other day and tonight I understand me and my friends where laughing having fun hanging out as we where trying to find fun things to mess around with after perchasing but it was unnecessary to tell us " I know what you're doing " and loudly call for a " security check around the perimiter " as if we where going to steal. And lastly I had a glow stick that I bought that was cracked and did not glow when I bought it. I felt upset allready after asking if I could exchange for the same item and asked " what's wrong with it? " not so kindly even after showing the glow stick dose not glow.</review>

<review>Great napa store, largest one in the area. They have lots of stuff in stock that most others don't carry. Friendly knowledgeable staff. It's the only parts store I'll use when I'm in the area so yes I absolutely recommend these folks.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>This particular Napa went from being the best place to being the worst. They have literally not honored their battery warranties, won't accept batteries for core charges even though they say they will, and just straight up are unethical, and unhelpful now. It's sad.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Went to pick up a part that napaonline showed in stock at this store.  When I arrived, the salesman said they had 2 in stock.  He went back to get the part and came back and said they didn't have any in the back when he looked.  Wasted my time driving all the way out here today.

However, there was a cashier in a red MAGA hat who refused to wear his mask!

<review>Sadly a really good customer service turned horrible
Larry did a great job finding something for me and had it shuttled over same day.
He did not know the policy that I was supposed to pay for it first.
After several calls the item was not in when it was supposed to arrive
Cody answered each time and could not locate it. He explained that it was supposed to be paid for and it would not be arriving.
I was not pleaded  since I wanted 3 hours to pick it up and could have gotten it by that time somewhere else. I asked for a manger so I could get it shuttled over asap.
The biggest jerk ever Manager Wes located the item and blamed me for being upset and wanted me to explain why I was being rude. I explained that Cody told me it was not possible to get my item without paying and I needed it that night. Wes was so condescending and self righteous. He has no understanding that a customer who is told an item is arriving and then is told it is not going to be delivered might be a little stressed and upset.
Wes needs training as a manager. Customers will be upset and a good manager defuses rather than argue with a customer about the internal policies. How was I supposed to know I was supposed to pay first? If I was told I would have gladly done so.
All Wes had to do is state that Cody was correct that the policy was to pay first but it was still shuttled over. He could have been better and understood the error was on their side.
I was able to scramble and find my item at another store.
Never giving my money or business to this store.
To Larry's defence he asked the procedure to another co-worker when he was getting my item set up for transfer. I could hear him asking. Possibly Wes.
Thank you Larry for efforts.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dc71c77fee6829:0xf9d40032b562b892< /Gmap_id>< rating>

<review>The customer service here was exceptional. I don't live near a Napa Auto Parts, but I always think of it as a *real* parts shop. Anyway, I just needed a battery and Declan was very helpful and provided solid advice of things to consider when replacing it. I purposely went there to get an Optima Red Top for my Outback that loves to consume batteries like french fries. Once again, great service by mechanically-experienced staff.

Big, clean store with lots of car parts.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Staff is not concerned about customer needs, almost like you being there is an inconvenience. Waited more then 15 minutes, while on my way to walking my daughter to school, to get new brake pads while a employee would rather get caught up with an old friend. Walked out not getting what I needed, if I could, this place deserves 0 stars.</Review><rating>1</rating><Time>1513971869971<//Time>< name>

I was looking for a headlight. After standing and looking for over 5 minutes I had 2 employees walk right past me and not say a word or ask if I needed help. I then approached the front desk where 3 employees were "helping" one customer and 3 others were doing who knows what on their computers. Once they were done with customer they all admired some amazing picture on another employee's Instagram account on their phone.
I'm going to order off of Amazon, and won't be back at this store.<//Text>

They have everything you need to DIY at reasonable prices. Other parts stores are closer, but I find myself back here to find what I'm looking for. 👍👍< /Text>

Never had problems until today. I walked in to receive some pricing on a battery. Lady was blunt and to the point, made no apologies for being so absolute. It was bordeline rude and disrespectful. I walked out and walked back in to purchase some additional products. I noticed she was helping another gentlemen, the service he received was 100% better than what I received. Dont know what the issue was. Just disapointed.< /review>

I give 3 stars because there is never a line and they have a huge inventory. Usually I exhaust all my other options before  purchasing a part here. Everything they sell here is double the price. The staff is not bad but not as helpful as autozone. If autozone doesn't have the part and you can't wait for it to come in online, go here.<//text>

Maybe I picked the wrong day to make it my first visit.   Walked into a lady screaming at other employees.  Most of them with shock and disbelief on their faces.   I am glad she disapeared and some one else helped me.   I won't return soon</review>

Great honest service. Jason is super cool and we swapped a few road stories. Got a new tire mounted within the time frame he said and best price in town.</Review>

Great place, Great guys, They really want to help you out.  The guys are super experienced and happy to share their experiences.  Not a huge shop so they dont stock a ton of stuff but what they have is good and basically the stuff they would like to use themselves.  Of course, they can get you anything in a few days too. And any time I've gone in looking like I've been on a hot ride, they offer me a bottle of cold water!< /text>

So Jason and co. definatley are the top trusted go to when need any question answered about pretty much any motorcyle subject. Old school from the mission Blvd Hayward bike and parts scene . As far as store goes. They usually carry the best money can buy and then one or two  more options that may be just a bit more affordable .</Review>

<text>Called to ask for a rough time estimate on my motor cycle oil leak. Clearly said, i am just looking for roughly how long it takes to address gear box leakages...I felt staff is rude as soon as he said: I can’t look your bike from here(we are on phone), and it sounds silly to give a general general estimate.

For any professional with reasonable experience, he knows time estimates for his job(a range is what I was looking for).

I am glad I decided to move on my search.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>They have awesome service. Their tire replacement services cheapest and best. Previously I tried cycle gear for $50 per wheel, adv design $35 per wheel(only when you buy a tire from them) and motoworks did it for $20 per wheel. It took me less than an hour to get my 2 wheels done.

Keep up the good work guys<//Review>< Pictures>

Dropped my bike off to switch tires. Was completed in well under an hour. Very pleased with price and quality of work. Service was very friendly and I got to snooze under a tree in the park behind the store for an hour. Needless to say that I will absolutely be coming back.< /Review>

Repairs were more than double what was quoted.  Owner gave me a 2 hour estimate in the morning.  At end of day, it was still not ready.  I had to pick up the following day at lunch time. I spoke with the owner who was extremely rude, obnoxious, and unapologetic.  I will never go back, nor recommend this place to anyone in my dirt bike group.  If I could give "ZERO STARS", I would.  Shop elsewhere folks!<//Text>

Great staff, very friendly and helpful. I took my tires in to get changed on a Saturday was the best price I found in the East Bay quicken easy and only cost 20 bucks a tire.  They had a great variety of moto and street bike equipment I recommend checking them out.< /Review>

First time dealing with this hometown motorcycle shop and my first experience was extremely good. Jason, the owner was very personable and his prices are reasonable. Got me a brand new sticky tire (Dunlop GPR 300 F) for the front end of my BMW R 1200 RT and heading to the pavement this weekend!

I'm one of those type of people that likes to keep the money in the neighborhood when possible and I will be returning to Motorwrx.

Thanks Jason!< /text>

The hours online are incorrect. They close at 7:00 so if you have to have something after work give them a call first. Also the mechanic told me they don't work on older bikes. The cut-off years for bikes they do work to is 10-15 years old.<//Text>

<user_id>109662824788888196296</user_id><review>Jason has been more than helpful in the last 4 visits.

First visit  was just checking the place out, offered  help the moment i walked through the door. ended up buying some tools.

Next visit, i told Jason, i was just browsing for helmets, but i wasn't serious.  He still made time for my questions and helped me get fitted up.

Third visit he helped me order a tuner for my RMX450Z and showed me a new Shoei helmet. (VFX-EVO).

Today, i came with the intention of leaving the wheels for my sons bike over the weekend. Jason and his Tech swapped the tires for me on the spot, Jason had also remembered i was looking for a chest protector and showed me a new one he had gotten in.  i also picked up the tuner i order and ordered a Shoei helmet.

Jason has been a great source of information for me, a new rider. My Wife, my sons and i have all been happy with the service we have received at Motowrx.< /review><Name>Ian Engle</Name>< Rating>

<Review>Been scouting for a good place to buy tamales for my employees. Normally buy about 10 or so dozen monthly. I was told of Luna's Bakery, so decided to try this place. I initially bought 1 & 1/2 dozen (half chicken, half red pork) for my family just to try them out. I spent $28.00 bucks. What a SHAME. The taste of the masa (dough) was decent, but what was terribly disappointing was the meat inside. After trying the first one, I noticed there was almost no meat or sauce, so instead of enjoying these tamales, my family and I spent the time inspecting them. LITERALLY, every single tamale had- and I do not exaggerate- about 4 or 5 Single Strands of chicken or pork about an inch long. I am sure, and I do not mean this sarcastically, they most likely use less than a chicken thigh to make a dozen tamales. I don't like to waste my time writing reviews but I was a bit angry with this place. What a bunch of miserable merchants. What a RIP OFF. Not even close to one star. I don't recommend this place; try a fast food place instead; my money would have been better spent buying tamales at Del Taco.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2ceb125ff7c03:0x23322ade5cc4cd77< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Only thing was they did not have a vast variety of sweet bread. I would have liked to see more bread and better arrangement and placement of it. Service was great. The gentleman who helped me was friendly.< /Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Crushed bread as if it were stepped on with the foot on the floor. If they are charging a good loaf, they should give a good loaf, adding that the employees who serve the customer are despotic and rude.

<text>For a place called burrito Express and for the prices that they charge for their burritos I honestly thought that their portions could be bigger. On the menu they definitely talk up their burritos to make them sound more than what they actually are I wasn't very pleased with this place I don't know if I'll ever go back again but for somebody that's been raised on burritos pretty much since the moment I got teeth? This place was not what I wanted or expected.</text>< resp>

It smelled so good, I just couldn’t resist! The burritos  here are HUGE!! Delicious, but need to eat it at more than one sitting (unless you are super hungry). I haven’t been here for a really long time. The staff was so kind in welcoming me back. I used to teach down the street. Sometimes I would bring my son and daughter here. We always loved it!💕</review>

Great family owned restaurant. The dinner plate is the best burrito plate in the area.  Get 'em wet with mole' sauce or dry.  Great either way!  And the staff is wonderful.  Always cheerful.</text>

One of my top favorite restaurants in Pasadena! I've been eating here for 10+ years, and I have never been disappointed! Amazing food, great prices, and wonderful workers! If you're looking to support a local family business, this is the one to go to!</review>

< Review>
Really was awfully and disappointingly surprised by the quality of food this time around. We have been coming here for years and years, and we finally made it back after bot being able to come for over a year or so....the food just wasn't up to par this time...very bland, and the salsa was REALLY REALLY bad. Not sure if it was old or what exactly. Also, my burrito was supposed to have a lot of stuff in it like onions, cheese, etc. and it only had meat, guacamole, and sour cream so I'm not sure why. I really hope this was just a one time fluke because I REALLY like this place....today however, just didn't cut it at all for me.......<//Review>

Crispy tacos are stale and cold, bean burrito is kids size. Taco Bell crispy tacos are honestly better!!! I asked for salsa and didn’t have any how does a “Mexican restaurant” have no salsa. Chips are probably the worst chips I’ve ever had. I’m from San Diego and DONT recommend this place anyone who’s out of town looking for a Mexican food place.< /Text>

This is my favorite Mexican joint in Pasadena. The food is traditional and fantastic - Mexican food for the soul. The employees treat you like family and in an age when so many restaurants are price gouging their customers, BE are staying true to putting the customer first. Love these guys! Now stop reading this and go get a burrito already!<//Text>

Unfortunately, the taste of the burritos has been inconsistent lately. The flavor of the beans is different. I have been eating here since it opened so I will keep coming in the hope that the greatness will return.<//Text>

But each time I’ve gone, I feel disappointed... the food is bland. The meat is dry.

And there was a hair in my torta! 🤢

I hate doing a bad review but I’ve tried thinking maybe it was just what I ordered. But 3 different items all disappointed.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Have a JVC Burrito or the Judge Itto. Everything is good here. The place is family owned and run. Its clean, their friendly and quick and prices are reasonable. The only thing is its tiny just 3 tables inside but plenty of seating outdoors which is only a problem are really cold days which we don't have here often if at all.< /text>

Oh WOW! They don't tell you why it's called Burrito Express, they show you. Because when you eat here it's a matter of seconds before you are on your way to flavor town. I picked the Breakfast Burrito, crispy hash browns, scrambled eggs, bacon, and cheese. My only regret was not being able to eat the rest of my daughters burrito ... because I was full.</Review>

The other is a small place in South Korea who’s incredibly kind nature and bim bim bop will change you fundamentally down to your soul.

Small family owned Mexican fast food. Excellent burritos with beans and rice or just meat if you want.  Asked if you want mild or spicy sauce, pick the spicy. It's not all that spicy but much more flavourful than the mild sauce.  If you do want a spicy kick take a couple of the small containers of homemade roasted dried chili sauce.  Both hot and sweaty!< /review>

<text>Pretty good sized burritos, cheap prices and delicious. I usually get the Ross Perot burrito, which has "Beef, Pork, AND Chicken, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Sour Cream, and Guacamole". Only reason it's a 4 star is because they lack a public bathroom and the health grade keeps fluctuating from an A to a B.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I stumbled upon this place in the late 90s & had a burrito so good, I've compared every burrito since to it. That is the Ross Perot burrito. Oddly named, but unforgettable... I cannot stress to you enough how much you need to try this! So much shredded beef, pork, & chicken that the ginormous tortilla can barely hold it all in! And it's only $6.59! Everything else looks great as well, but I always get the Ross Perot :-)</review>< date>

Literally a hole in the wall. It's one of those places I've driven by literally 1000 times growing up here. Finally stopped by a few months ago and I feel like I hadn't lived until now. It's definitely a take out kinda spot since there's only like 2 tables to plop yourself at. Get the wet burrito and tacos with an horchata. You won't regret it.</review>

<review>9/9/16 If I could give no stars I would. Yes the prices are reasonable, but the food was absolutely disgusting. It was very clear that the food is not cooked when ordered. More like the meats were cook previous day's before. It seems like the cook just assembles the food with no respect to the art of food. Very disappointed with the answers I got respect to the food. I know this established restaurant will read my post. So please step it up by cooking fresh.. no just in a sense serving left overs.< /review>< user>

I have been going here since the early 1980's. Newer owners have changed some of the recipes since the 4 stars... Change the salsa and other receipes back and it is 5 stars again!<//Text>

<Text>After going to college in the area, I try and stop by every time I am in the area. The regular bean and cheese burrito, with green sauce, is ridiculous.

<Review>Well the area is a bit expensive....when they said this was one dollar sign it should of been two dollar signs because it adds up and the burritos are super small. I got the carne asada burrito and it was good. Just ask for light beans. The carne asada was delicious but my brother order the machaca burrito with sauce and cheese on top...he got his order wrong. I guess he didn't say Vic's special that why he didnt get the sauce and cheese but rang up as one😑. Also,  the extra cheese he ordered was in my burrito...maybe they used imitation cheese bc it was cold in my burrito and didn't melt at all. Also being lactose intolerant cheese usually messes me up but this time didn't. 😂 Well it was our first time we'll try next time 🤣<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>112195539832184539641< /UserId.><Rating>4<//Rating><time>1556770500930<//time>< username>

1st time there after reading reviews.  Not sure what the hype was... Carne asada burrito was salty and beef was dry.  Nachos had barely any cheese and the guacamole was light gray/green- no sign of any avacado. Service was good.  Place was clean.  Unfortunately, the food was not very good.  Maybe it was a bad day?< /Text>

These are the best breakfast burritos ever. They're huge, and I always make a mess eating one, but oh so good. The salsa they give you is to die for. Pour a little on with each bite and you'll be in heaven, even if there is sweat dripping down your forehead.</Text>

Great service and welcoming atmosphere, but probably not the best spot for burritos in town. The flavors that are usually robust in mexican food were minimal in the meats here, and at times the beef had a chewiness the texture of a wet tissue. Great place to stop if you're on the run and want something to hold you over for a few hours that doesnt have to be delicious. Its definitely good enough to eat, but there isn't anything spectacular about it. You'll find that the refried beans and the hot sauce seem to have the most flavor.<//Text>

Usually a good place to grab a bite to eat but the last couple of times ive ordered the jvc its been subpar. Today the asada was way overcooked like it was from  yesterday and all they did was reheat it and throw it in the burrito.</Review>

<Text>Fast service, excellent salsa/hot sauce, excellent burritos. Try Vic's style, with sauce and cheese on top (wet style, basically, but also served with chips and a salad).<//Text>< Date>

The lady at donations was kind and showed us where to put the things we were donating. When there was a question, she kindly said they were not items the SA could use. A very pleasant experience.<//review>

I was looking for a large suitcase and was sure I was going to have to go elsewhere and pay retail. Fortunately I found a nwt Pierre Cardin roller for 30 bucks!! It retailed for 340!! Thank goodness I didn't buy the Jessica Simpson one from Kohls last night!! It was smaller and 179!! I love Salvation Amy!!< /review>

It's a good big thrift store but they do not give military discounts and  They should.  If we can go out and die to protect their freedom that's the least they could do.< /review>

I understand that if a child is under 5 they don't require masks. Went into the Salvation army store and was told my son can't be in the store and they asked him to leave. He is 3 years old! I've never met someone so rude.</review>

Love this store and can't wait to go back now that it's open again. We drive 1.5 hours to go to it. Very clean, well organized and super friendly staff. This is a thrift store you shouldn't miss!!< /Text>

< Review>
Nice place ,clean big ,plenty of room for more stuff ,but as usual limited amount of men's stuff ,but hey ,that's normal, not to keen on how they rack stuff ,by color ,not by size, makes it hard to find stuff that fits ,but it is a nice place</Review>

I really enjoy going there ! I like to find new 🏷 clothes and they have new brand  name purses. They have great customer service not like employees from Hospice  Thrift store  on Pelandale   and McHenry.< /review>

The new store on McHenry is big and located across the street (practically) from another big thrift store. The new store is clean well organized and the staff, very friendly.  The sale items that I purchased were priced right. I especially appreciated the help Maria and others provided. It was so nice to see Alma working at the new store. She is an asset to the Salvation Army and the reason I sat down to writing this review.
Thanks Alma, Maria and others at the Salvation Army<//Text>

Much better than the old location on Yosemite Blvd. It's located in a much safer part of town as well. Very spacious and clean. I've noticed the prices have gone down for the better too with some items. I hope it stays that way.< /Text>

< Review>
Do not waste your time. This place is over priced. I seen stuff in there that you could purchase new for cheaper. See the bed frame? The matress is another $250. No side tables just the bed frame for $899. WOW. FOR 1K YOU COULD PURCHASE A USED BED. RIDICULOUS< /Review>

Doughnuts always taste great. But the best part of this shop is Octavio! He’s a phenomenal employee! I can always sense his kindness behind the mask. Give him a raise because coming here always gives me faith again in humanity 🌞🙌<//text>

Absolutely the best coffee I have found so far. The prices are great and the employees are amazing so friendly they even know me by name and usually see me before I walk on... Most of the time if they are not busy they already have my order ready or pretty close...(always get the same thing lol)</Text>

Best donuts that i have had in the last couple of years!  I asked for a dozen, and they gave me a bakers dozen (15)!  I was in San Diego for 4 days and we got donuts twice.  They aren't your crispy cremes.  These have some heft to them.<//text>

Yum Yum Donuts, like most donut places can be hit and miss. This location is always a HIT. Great selection and friendly people. I especially love the bagel sandwiches!</Review>

I love this place. By far my favorite go to DONUTS. I wake up at 0245 just get them the donuts fresh and warm. Donuts holes are to die for. It's so warm and soft.  It literally melts in your mouth. Staff there is super friendly and nice. #1 donuts in town by far my favorite.  I was born and raised her in SD so Yaaaaas!<//text>

DoD  (Day Old Doughnuts) can't beat them . I don't have much money..., so whenever I can save a little, I do .... so let me start with a short story about this little shop, and the great manager that this shop has. I'm up most nights pretty late , sometimes all night. Late one night , or was it early morning, I was out for some fresh air; I was cold , hungry, and about to fall asleep. So this place is open 24/7 . I had maybe 2,or3 $  . So I order a coffee and I ask if they have any day old doughnuts, you know the ones they are about to throw out ; like they do every day. Well he hooked me up with a small bag ( of doughnuts)to add to my large coffee. Wide awake from the coffee, full belly from the doughnuts I was ready to start my day or continue it anyway. So I always tip them when I can, and sometimes I don't get there early enough for the day old d's , but I am definitely a fan. 5stars and then some.<//review>

The perfect place to go in the mornings!! Donuts are always fresh when I get them, and there are other delicious choices to get besides donuts. Plus, the place has good spacing.</Review>

Donuts brought us here, but the burritos and sandwiches were excellent as well.

The Grilled Pork salad was amazing; huge bowl of green with a layer of tomatoes and cucumbers, followed by a layer of perfectly grilled thin pork. Gets busy during the lunch hour, but worth the wait.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmyLHHYvQVOE8-m0JJTWp6vuaG-ywaoZ4-0oea=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

My wife and I recently visited Vietnam. Ever since, we craved good Vietnamese food. This place has very good Vietnamese food. Probably the best in the bay area. I wish this place is closer to where I live. I would come here on the regular. Highly recommend the Banh Mi, Summer rolls and iced coffee.<//text>

My wife, grandson , and I ate lunch today at Pho & Baguette.  We had huge portions of Chicken Pho with noodles at a very reasonable price.  Very delicious and we took a large portion home for later. We are visiting our Son and his family in Alameda.  We are from Tuscaloosa, AL.  We will be back!</Review>

Easy to see right off of Central Avenue servicing Alameda and the adjoining areas of California.   Plenty of parking and a wheelchair accessible entrance to.   Moderately clean facilities.   Reasonably priced.   Credit cards accepted.   We will most likely be going back.<//Text>

It always good.  I like my eggs likely cooked not so hard. The added is you are open in the evening. Great when your doing laundry in a mall; you can take out or enjoy sitting down.</Text>

<name>Omar Qaddoumi<//name><Text>in summery: horrible customer service, the food was cold, took 1 hour for a food pickup.

I first made an order on doordash for pickup, doordash called and said the the place want to cancel because the want direct orders and something about pricing, since this was 15 mins later and I was half way there, I thought to call and make the order, when I called an irritated lady answered the phone and then gave me to another employee to take my order, which is fine people have hard days, they took the order forgot to take my name and told me it'll be 20 mins.

10 mins later when I arrived to the restaurant I went in and paid, and went outside to wait for my order to be ready in 10 mins, when I went back in to check if it was ready, the same irritated lady from the phone told me in angry tone to wait outside and she'll get me the food out there, so I decided to go wait in the car which is parked right infront of the restaurant, 40 mins later when it seems that everybody got there food and I was still waiting, I went again to check and surprisingly my food was ready for a while, not it was colder, and she was sitting there chatting with a guy, there were no customers in the store, when I asked her why you didn't call for me or brought me the food like you said when you asked me to wait outside,  she said that she couldn't find me, while she have seen me at least twice when she walked outside, the funny part is that they started blaming me for not communicating with them.

oooh and one more thing, the order was missing stuff.<//Text><date>1591488798445</date><Rate>1< /Rate><GmapID>0x808f81258ea8734d:0x8cdc8883b36d4873</GmapID>< UserId.>

It’s the biggest Vietnamese sandwich I have had. Very tasty, full of flavor. Lots of veggies and good bread! I hate when people say this place is not authentic. Authentic to me means it’s supposed be exactly like Vietnam. No, it’s not and it doesn’t have to be. It’s good as it is. The spring rolls were amazing too. I will be back because the food is great and the vibe is cool. Great service.

Just ate here and am pleasantly plump.  First off, the pork fries are amazing.  Super good, sweet and tangy with the perfect amount of fat. crispy fries and super additive.  I also had the garlic noodles which were garlicky but, not too spicy or hard to eat.  My 3 year said the food was awesome.  Also got a couple bahn mi to go for tomorrow's lunch.  We go to crab cove often in the summer and we'll also be eating more Pho & Baguette.<//text>

The food here was acceptable and that is the most I can honestly say.  It was not bad, nor was it good. If I was looking for food in the area, it's unlikely I would choose this place again.</Review>

I love my coffee sweet and they made my vietnamese coffee perfect. Usually at other places it's too strong and she said they make theirs strong too but she can make mine sweeter. It was sweet with a kick of caffeine. Perfect balance. And bbq pork banh mi sandwich was delicious. It had big pieces of meat. The bread was soft with a bit of crunch. I will definitely come back to try the pho.< /text>

<text>The coffee from this place might be the best thing I have ever tasted in my life.  There is nothing at Peet's which can possibly top it.  Their food is also out of this world and very reasonably priced.  My family would eat here every day if we could.  This is another Alameda gem.< /text>< Pictures>

One of the better tasting places I've been to. I found the pho a tad pricy, other items were normally priced. Also wish it was a tad cleaner, our table was not bussed and there were no napkins to clean up ourselves. Our condiments were also missing but we easily borrowed from a neighboring table. Their flavored water is nice.<//Review>

<Text>Good Vietnamese food in Alameda.
Good service.
Nice local business and reading their menu will intrigue your fascination of their inventive food.

I regularly get their Vietnamese chicken, boba  drinks and pho. Vietnamese sandwiches are always good. Check out their pandan waffles  (Vietnamese cocunut waffles) and their potato twister. The chef is very inventive with the food, and have different exotic food I thought were brand new to me.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>This place is a very solid 4 stars with a great selection of deli products, baked goods and other specialty items. They also make great sandwiches, broasted chicken and lots of other yummy things. Friendly and efficient staff, easy to get to location with ample parking make this a go to take out or it in option.< /review><response>None<//response>< rating>

This place has one of the best menu and excellent food around.
Unfortunately, the same CANNOT be said for their Online Orders for Delivery Service

So on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being best, I would rate their FOOD as a 9.6 , however, using the same 1/10 rating system,
I rate their WEBSITE and associated sub-menus as a  -10 ( you do the math)

My wife and I both have spent over  40 years in Computer Software technology and it is painful to see our local establishments with great products suffer because of problematic access to their business .

We will always remain loyal customers

<user_name>lori Montoya</user_name><Text>My husband and I used to love this place. This last time we bought the chicken dinner. On a scale from 1-10, it was a 5.
We also bought 4 different cakes/cheesecake. They looked good but were absolutely horrible!
I could not believe that they sold us the cakes/cheesecakes as they were old and tasted like they had been in the refrigerator for quite a while. I was upwraping these, I noticed the date they were sliced and packaged on the styrofoam plate and the date was 5 days prior. And who knows how long it was made before then! As you may or may not know, these old deserts are not cheap. I spent over $20 for just 4 of them. If they were fresh, they might have been worth it.
I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND BUYING ANY OF THEIR DESERTS TO ANYONE. And the chicken dinner ($28) was mediocre at best. The 4 broasted potatoes had black spots in them so we had to throw those away as well. The best part of this purchase of over $52 was the coleslaw. That is alot of money just to enjoy coleslaw!<//Text><Rating>1< /Rating><Time>1599775615698< /Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

😍 I didnt know the deli had changed locations. I hadn't been to OWD in decades but I was in the area and in desperate need to lift my spirits. I googled it and sure enough I found the new location (new to me at least), and I just had flashes of going to the one in Puente Hills when I was little and really missing that location. I thought of my mom and my Italian godmother (God rest both of their souls) who lived around the corner and some good ol honestly cooking.  I ordered capicola, artichokes, meatball sandwich, a wedding cookie, super soft bread, cannolis, oh and some spicy Italian sausages 😋... I figured was in heaven, might as well carry on the joy for a few days, eh?<//Text>

Immediately fell in love with this place. The ambiance is welcoming, great displays of what they have to offer from baked desserts, to mouthwatering cookies/pastries, to deli meats, to countless sides. It’s hard coming here and not wanting to but everything. My favorite is the baked mostaccioli dinner, but everything is great. Customer service is always the best.< /review>

Excellent food, deli, and ingredients. Always love coming here!

Favorites are the chicken, Brooklyn Bridge Grinder, and their roast beef from the deli.< /review>

Great sandwiches made with fresh meats, cheese and bread.  Their menu consist of hot and cold sandwiches and much more.  They have several delicious salads to choose from such as pasta, cole slaw and potato salad.   Top it off with one of their irresistible cookies or cakes and you have an amazing meal.  Never disappointed!<//Text>

<Text>I've had three dealings with Old World Delicatessen thus far, and hope to have many more. Not only is their food outstanding, but their customer service is great, too. My father is in a  nursing home and they helped ensure he had his favorite dessert, plus a yummy dinner on Father's Day.
One of my family's favorite places. ♥️♥️♥️< /Text>< pics>

I've been going to Old World since I was a young boy.  I'm 50 now and I can honestly and accurately say OWD has the best meatball sandwiches, the best fried chicken, the best salad bar and the best soups I have ever had.  Homemade and authentic food.  Very fresh and done with pride.  Staff has always been outstanding.  Whenever family or friends are in town, this is always one of the places I take them to when I want to show off.  😉< /Review>

<Text>TL,DR: great food but on the pricey side. It's the only real deli in the area.

Takeout is open and there is limited outdoor dining. Calling ahead to order is a good idea.<//Text>< pictures>

Been coming here for over 15 years and I just realized I never left a review. Well not much needs to be said, their reputation speaks for itself. It's obviously a 5* restaurant but I'd like to take this opportunity to officially recommend the spaghetti and meatball dinner. The best in town.<//text>

The food was very good the prices are very reasonable for the high quality food do we get an Services nice but because of the pandemic they need to put a sign on the door that you need to come in and order first before you sit down at a table. I highly recommend this place.< /text>

I was on my way home from Santa Monica to Redlands when someone recommended this place. When I walked in I was so impressed with the appearance of the deli so clean and the staff was so friendly. I ordered the pizza and lasagna ( Delicious!!) the pastas and cheeses looked great. I wanted to buy everything!! for this reason i will be returning.  Happy customer!!! Oh!! I forgot to mention the lemon cake was amazing!!!</Text>

They use to make the best hot roast beef nd soft bread with a crisp pickle.  Well now that I went again,  it was terrible.  The bread was super hard,  didn't even get a pickle nd it was over mayonnaise. Will not go back again.</text>

First time here and Boy o Boy! My eyes got so big like Bugs Bunny over carrots when I saw the array of desserts they had on display.  I didn't order dessert but I tried there cold turkey sandwich on wheat with avocado, minus tomatoes.  The bread was fresh and they packed it with plenty of thin sliced turkey. I enjoyed it and plan on returning again the next time I am in the area.< /text>

We’ve been going to Old World Delicatessen for years. Love the new location what an improvement over the old location. Like the sandwiches and chicken. One of the cleanest Salad bars ever. The finest quality ingredients and polite staff. We love sneaking out on Mondays. Great place to pick up your Lunch meats. Boars head turkey with extra pepper and the honey flavored ones are my favorite. They also have an amazing loaf of Walnut bread.</text>

The food was great! I ordered a hot rib eye steak sandwich. The service was friendly. They service soft drinks, beer and wine. My friend ordered a wonderful dinner with pasta and sausage. The sausages are made on site as well as the bread for my sandwich.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>One of the cleanest Salad bars ever. The finest quality ingredients and polite staff.We love sneaking out on Mondays. Great place to pick up your Lunch meats. Boars head turkey with extra pepper and the honey flavored ones are my favorite. They also have an amazing loaf of Walnut bread. True delicatessan, w/ lots of yummy sandwiches - different meats, cheeses, and side orders. Worthy of lunch, or dinner, it's a great place to eat. Friendly service. Small place. Can take out, too<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Really happy with the food and service. Have eaten salads from salad bar which were fresh and a decent selection of toppings. Lasagna was delicious. Large selection of sides like three bean salad (yum) and  traditional options like potato salad or macaroni salad. Sandwiches were filling and there are many varieties. Our family favorite is the meatball sub or pastrami. Have eaten the chicken as well and it was tender and a hit with my picky toddler. An excellent choice for a quick take away family meal on a busy week night. Dessert selection was awesome. Traditional Italian desserts and pastries.< /Review><Response>None</Response><date>1515610944627</date>< user_id>

It is a great restaurant, located in Covina. The meals are quite delicious, and they are prepared in the Southern European style, mainly Italian way, which I find delicious and enjoyable. Furthermore, they have certain non alcoholic beverages that are quite popular in France and Italy. So, if anyone is in the area, I would recommend to visit this store, and taste their meals, which are prepared similarly to the ways of France and Italy.< /Text>

Hadn't tried this place before. Boss took me over for lunch and I'm hooked. Excellent quality and everything is fresh. It can be busy and everything is made to order. So it can take a while to get your order. But to me it is so worth it.<//text>

<text>Let's start by saying the service was outstanding.  I was in line with a woman who had been going to this deli for 30 years and raved about it.  The gentleman (seemed like owner or manager) asked if this was my first time and then began to provide star treatment.  Excellent breads and my turkey, bacon & avocado with potato salad was yummy!< /text><user_name>Pauline Simpson< /user_name>< Resp>

Good portion size. Slightly higher costs,  but excellent quality. Old school deli with homemade foods. Try the chicken soup  or chicken with dumplings,  yum. Decent salad bar selections,  serviced often and kept clean.</text>

Delicious food, staff is awesome. I love picking up food here because it tastes and looks homemade. The staff is super friendly, I love it. You can't stop by if you're in a hurry unless you're getting something from the Deli, but it's definitely worth the wait.< /review>

The chicken is different. Chicken is low quality. Has a smell too. For the price it would be nice if the quality of chicken was better. The rest is great. Im rating the chicken here.< /Review>

I've been going to Old World for years, well before it moved to its current location. I hadn't gone for a few months, but last night I rekindled my love for Old World's food as I had the Eggplant sandwich on Sourdough, the Vegetable Beef soup and the coleslaw. Everything was delicious, hardy. and just perfect. They also have a fresh salad bar which cold pasta salad besides all the vegies. Old World will always be my fav!< /Text>

I just had the most amazing egg plant Parmesan sandwich on a Kaiser roll that I never had before! It was toasted with the eggplant Parmigian... a nice thick piece on top of each of those halves.  It was so delicious...
melt in your mouth crispy on the bread with Parmesan toasted just perfectly right!  I’ve never been here before because I’m from out of town, but I’m coming again! And talking with a few people there they said it’s all about the taste. I can’t wait to experience their  fish and chips Friday!  I’m feeling good now!</review>

This is a great Italian deli thats close by my house. They have weekly specials but definitely a LARGE array of desserts. Pricing is decent but most of all quality of the food is why I keep coming back. Parking is pretty easy to. Wish they were open late then 8pm though.<//review>

< Review>
The deli has moved from their old Eastland Center location to 126 E Shoppers Ln, in Covina just a couple of blocks north. The restaurant space is better but finding a parking space can be a challenge during peak hours. The food is still awesome but it might be my imagination telling me the portion sizes are a bit smaller. Please note that this business recently moved from Workman over to 128 Shoppers Lane (same city). The service here is friendly, the food great, and very reasonably priced The only negative is that if you arrive at noon, good luck finding a parking space.</Review>

Grinders, broasted chicken and salad bar is what I enjoy most here. Their broasted chicken is tender and juicy, even for the breast pieces. I reeeally enjoy their broasted chicken. Very cool spot as they also have a full service deli, pizzas and soups from scratch and baked Italian pasta favorites. They serve a little bit of everything here and do them all well. A local favorite eatery!< /review>

I've been coming to Old World Deli for 25 years.  It recently moved to Shoppers Lane so some of the atmosphere was lost as well as no outdoor seating appropriate to bring your furry friends along.  Food seems to be the same quality and prices are reasonable.  Parking and seating can be a big issue during normal lunch times.  The most popular items seem to be their pizza and broasted chicken.<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I've been going to Old World Deli since I was 16 in high school. So for 37 years I have enjoyed everything from their mouth-watering sandwiches to the specialty foods in the deli.  Great pizza and the entree's also keep us coming back.  They were the first to introduce frozen yogurt too,  which was the best around.  Why they stopped serving it is unknown and greatly missed.  Thanks for all the good eats, OWD.  Much love and respect.< /review>< pics>

Im sure the food is good however when people dont like certain ingredients like lettuce, mayo, and mustard on premade sandwiches and thats all there is to eat at a catered event, I never got a chance to find out. Condiments should always be offered not ready made.< /text>

Love the freshness of the food they sell. Full service deli, lox, amazing butter cookies, and meats of all sorts. Along with there full menu of pizza and other Italian favorites the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. This store is one of my go 2's for Covina eats.<//review>

Variety and great taste. I ordered a meatball sandwich and a Brooklyn bridge to spilt. The meatball was amazing. It tasted fresh and cheesy. The Brooklyn bridge tasted okay. My mother ordered a ribeye steak sandwich and it was juicy and yummy but a little messy.  I was very impressed with their deli salads(pasta salad with meat and seafood salad). Both were very seasoned  and we ate them as a side to our meal.  Highly recommended.</Review>

Their egg plant park is so yummy and their boasted chicken is very good. oh and their salad bar is amazing. they have home made soups and their macaroni salad is famous as well as delicious.
Alex and his brother are the owners and they have two locations...one in Covina, Ca  and one in (think it's Montclair or upland). Delicious food and a nice wine and beer selection
too. They also do catering!</text>< Pictures>

Old World Deli is a habit worth making. Always enjoy homemade dishes from pasta to soups. Broasted chicken is the best in the valley and their dessert selection warrents a visit on its own. A true Italian delicatessen is the core here but the menu variety is the tasty difference. Bada boom!!<//Text>

<review>I like Old World's chicken but it's absurd to charge 3.75 for each addtl chicken breast. That's 1/2 the price of a 2 piece combo. 😞<//review><gmap_id>0x80c3285294ce9a57:0x58464adc56972ad7<//gmap_id>< pictures>

<text>I have been going here for years. Joe the owner got me hooked on their Lox & Cream cheese on Sourdough bread. My husband & I go often because we like to give business to local business.
When I order the Lox& Cream cheese on sourdough I always pay for extra lox without hesitation.

Tonight we went in at 4:30  to get take out. It was the second time I have ordered this to go and paid extra and when I opened the bag at home I did not get extra lox that I paid for. I live in Walnut which is too far to go back so they can correct their mistakes!

When I called upon getting home, regarding this issue,  I spoke to the manager, she  was not to concerned that I paid for something I did not get? She told me that although I paid for extra lox and did not get them. I should have been charged for sourdough bread as well because it was not a bagel????

What?????? The girl who took our order and our money even shared with me that she eats the same thing but on wheat bread instead???
No one has ever told me that I need to be charged for bread????
This place changes their story way too many times to be trusted.  I will  never go back because it appears that the staff make up their own rules.
Paying extra for anything and the staff has absolutely no conciense that you did not get what you paid for is unacceptably lazy and despicable!

If you want to get ripped off then th his is the place yo yo. So many seniors frequent this place and are probably being cheated regularly!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c3285294ce9a57:0x58464adc56972ad7<//gmapID></record>

< Review>
I also visited last weekend and had phoned in an order.  As ALWAYS still had to wait even though called in over an hour before and scheduled a pickup.  Was over a 20 minute wait.  Plus, the chicken has gotten rediculously small.  The legs were slightly bigger than a wing dummette.  Same great broasted flavor, but between the wait every single time, the expensive cost, and the decreasing size forces me to look elsewhere.  So disappointed because i really like the flavor, but tired of the absolute disrespect of the customers in ALWAYS waiting and decreased portion.< /Review>

We were in line to order dinner then a customer cut in front of us to order a drink, the cashier should have told him to wait until we placed our order but served him first. Very disappointed.< /review>

I have been coming to OWD for more than 20 years, the food, service, and quality has been great for all these years. The new location is beautiful and the pictures of the old place bring back some great memories.
I love this place</text>

As far as I know: Bomb bomb bomb 💣.
This place is amazing! Flavor-wise, quality-wise, good for lunch and dinner AND they have pastries and cookies 😍.
Totally worth your time and money!</review>

< Review>
WHAT IT IS
A FULL Italian deli. They stock BOARS HEAD MEATS (!!!), so there's a source of them in West Covina! Get the Everroast Chicken--your taste buds will love you. In addition to the meats, they have various salads and the ubiquitous Italian cookies.

They also have a restaurant section where they serve "Broasted" chicken, sandwiches, pizza, and soups. Please note--it's tucked away on Shopper's Lane, so it can be a little hard to find if you aren't used to the area.

WHAT YOU SHOULD ORDER
Sandwiches, deli meat

AMBIANCE
5 stars
I really like the look of this place. When you enter, you're standing in the deli portion of the store (which is partitioned from the dining room by a shelf). They have the full line of Boar's Head products including their flavored mayonnaise and mustard. The deli counter is to your right--the bar to order food is directly ahead. There's also a little dessert case right next to where you order your food to tempt you.

The dining room is nice and open and features a salad bar--a rarity in this day and age. This location is relatively new and it shows--everything is clean and lovely looking.

FOOD AND DRINKS
5 Stars
I am in love with their chicken salad sandwich. I've never had a chicken salad so good--I usually don't like chicken salad because I hate celery--but they ground everything up so finely that it comes out more like a delicious spread than a chunky salad. They serve that sandwich on a kaiser roll complete with poppy seeds, which just makes the east coaster in me super happy. I've never tried the chicken, but it smells quite good. I've also not tried the pizza.

NICE SURPRISES
Fruit tarts! One of my favorite little dainty desserts, and yet it's so hard to find outside of the Mexican super markets. And they're good, too!

OVERALL
A fantastic little deli for West Covina!< /Review>
