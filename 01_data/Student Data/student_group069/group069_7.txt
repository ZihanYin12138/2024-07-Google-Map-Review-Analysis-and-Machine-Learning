Got a 90 minute couples massage from Groupon for like $130 I think. This is the third massage I have gotten. We came in for our 12:30 appointment like at 12:20 and we were led inside after filing out some questionnaire that asked about preferences. The massage ended at exactly 2:00pm so we got our scheduled 90 minutes including the time to change in the beginning. I would come back since it was a good experience for the price. The massage included a bit of hot stones and the massage beds were warm and it was cozy. Overall good experience! Recommend 👍
Parking does suck but it sucks everywhere in this area. We didn’t struggle too much with it though we only looked for like 5 minutes. Also receptionist was very friendly !<//Review>

By the THE  best massage I've ever gotten. Me and my boyfriend have been here a few times now, but Gina & Sunny are hands down the best!!! While we requested certain areas to be targeted, they asked if they could work on other tense body parts, parts we didn't even think were tense. We walked out feeling UH-MAZING!!!<//review>

April was INCREDIBLE. I’m a regular massage goer and needed a thorough & firm massage after a day of travel & site seeing. Best massage I ever had! We walked into the wrong location at 815 and they were still  eager to accommodate myself +2 friends. Highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a pressure intensive massage. The service was remarkable.< /Review>

<Review>Fiancé surprised me with a couples massage. Masseuse was great, pressure was DEFINITELY delivered. A nice environment, great relaxing experience. There are different packages where you can enjoy some snacks and beverages afterwards. Just street parking available, heads up on making it on time. Highly recommended.

When the winter is getting you down or your boss is acting like a jerk, when you get into a fight with your mom or you are tired of your daily routine, or when you just want to treat yourself to something special, Inman Oasis is the place. Affordable, relaxing, friendly... a real cure for the winter blues.</Review>

The lady who's doing the massage just step on me, she don't even use her hands to massage me that's kinda weird. The right way to do it is first the head down to the foot there are doing it opposite. They don't know how to do massage. FYI, my sister got bruises here. The tip it's to much $15-$20 for 60 minutes and $20 or more for 90 minutes. Don't come here it's just a waste. 👎<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I would stay weary of how this business does business. Keeping integrity on policies is difficult for this business to follow through with. Changing policies in order to tack on additional charges and when I asked the front desk clerk for the managers information, they claimed that they were in fear of losing their job, among other topics disclosed by the clerk and were not allowed to give their manager’s information out. I had to either pay additional charges or forfeit my entire massage. Either way, I would not recommend this massage parlor for lack of adherence to their own policies, short-lived integrity with their costumers and the manner in which customer complaints are held is both questionable on the Manager’s part and unprofessional.</Text>< pictures>

I liked them well enough, but now I can't get them to return my phone calls after I bought a massage in advance. I have what is apparently a useless coupon. I have called them repeatedly, but no success. I'd advise people to stay away.< /text>

<user_id>102845268523663508476< /user_id><Text>I purchased a Groupon for a massage. Since I'm on vacation and I'm visiting family I decided why not. Also, this was my second massage so I was really looking forward to it. I didn't have a good experience with my first massage. It was very rough and I was super sore afterwards. After purchasing the Groupon booking my appointment was a little frustrating but it got figured out. I scheduled a later time (I was their last customer). A lot of people on here complain about the parking. I had no trouble finding parking but this is Hollywood so parking will be a hit or miss. My first time at this place my massage was 90 minutes. Was instantly greeted when I walked in. They kept calling me to come in a little earlier but I was driving but I did manage to arrive 20 minutes early. I undressed then Amy walked in. Very friendly, engaging I love throughout majority of the massage she was making conversation and just making me feel comfortable. I requested for a woman so I was pretty excited to get Amy since I read all the positive reviews about her. She definitely knows what she's doing and if you tell her to focus on a certain area of your body she will takecare of you. I felt so much better after that massage and because of her is the reason why I'll be returning the next time I visit home. Thank you 💖❤💖</Text>< name>

I tried a couples massage with my wife and  had a truly terrible experience. The massage was rough in all the wrong places. Bending my leg in uncomfortable positions, pressing hard on vertebrae and other bones that needed no pressure. I actually had to walk out in the middle because it was so uncomfortable. I did not feel that the masseuse had any knowledge of muscular anatomy. Would stay away. My wife's massage was similarly uncomfortable and she was about to tap out around the same time I did. Cant comment on the entire staff, but the two people we encountered left us with new aches .</Text>

<text>The worse treatment ever had! I bought a couple massage through Groupon. I had some carcrashes in the past, so that I advised the girl who was going to make my massage. I'm used to receive any kind of massage, but it has never happen to feel that worse after one of them! She caused me a terrible pain (actually a pain that I didn't have before!) as she didn't have a clue of what she was doing, nor sensibility or knowledge...
I called them to ask some help and they answered that they didn't have time.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The staff is pathetic. We had an appointment and missed it because my daughter had an emergency at the hospital. Obviously our thoughts were not on any appointments at the time. The Amazon local deal we purchased did say they had the option of forfeiting the voucher and of course they did not hesitate to do that. So they took our money and we got NOTHING in return. I called to explain but the receptionist made it clear she did not care and was actually laughing on the phone while saying I am not sure what you want me to do. I said, can you not even give us the value of what we paid towards services and she said no, why didn't you call us? AFTER I had already explained my daughter was in the hospital. I guess they expected me to forget about her and either go to my appointment or rewind time to give 24 hours notice.

Either way, they made it obvious that they are more than happy to take money people work hard to earn and give nothing in return. ZERO service. I would have been fine getting the face value out of it considering it was an emergency that could not have been planned. All I got was laughed at.

I do not recommend ANYONE go here. The service was the worst I ever encountered anywhere. I have heard of employees laughing at customers but never experienced it first hand. There are enough options available at places that treat their customers better. Sparadise doesn't care at all about theirs. Money for nothing is what they want. Enjoy ours you will not get anymore of it.

UPDATE: Amazon as always stepped up to the plate and refunded the voucher. Amazon does customer service right, this "Spa" could learn a lot. I still say avoid it, they are rude.

Also notice, they voted for themselves so with only 3 ratings it is hugely impacted by their FALSE vote. This place is a total joke.<//Text></record>

First, massage started 30 mins later for some reason. They didn't say why. Felt pretty awkward. Then, the "romantic" couples massage turned out to be not so. We were practically in adjacent but different "rooms", separated by curtains. Massage was ok at times for me, but bad for my spouse. Her therapist felt amaturish so she came out worse than she came in. At the end, when you're asked for the tip, your therapists come out and practically stare at you giving the " suggested gratuity", even if they totally don't deserve it.< /Review>

<time>1474748372161</time><rating>5< /rating><Review>I am just ordinary guy who really need to retreat from my tension.My family live in west LA and normally i and tons of friends got the massage from chiva massage (they are great) that located nearby our house after long day. i and my wife need to went to the party in hollywood after i finished my dinner  with my wife at thai restaurant and found this place that opposite to the restaurant we got an idea to get the massage. We just stopped by this place. first at all this place looked pretty clean and the receptionist was very nice to us so she ask us to seat on the sofa and asked about our tensions and style that we was looking for. We decided to get the combination massage with the hot rock relieve and it cost 130 for us.this price is reasonable compare to the other place. after we finished a short coversation she took us to the room. room was clean and we feel much better when we saw new sharp linen sheet to cover the table.we was waiting about 2 minute after that therapists came in and introduce theirself. Mr.TC or TG and Teo they both have an exellent technics. when we fished we gave them 40 bucks for each person for their tried. i believe and absolutly sure when you get the good services you must respect them by give it back to them at the same level that you get it.Hopefully we have time and get back to get the sweet services from you guy again cause you are the Great massage in hollywood.< /Review>< Pics>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Saw a deal on groupon.  Before purchasing I called to ask about it (cuz there always seems to be a 'limited number' of groupon slots available).  Staff told me to not purchase the Groupon and instead pay with cash directly to them.  They assure me the price will be honored.  Drove there with my wife for our couples massage and had to park blocks away.  Walked in and was told the price would not be honored and they tried to charge us an additional 25%.  Girl at desk was both rude and clueless.  Thanks for letting my wife down.  She even had the audacity to tell me to purchase the Groupon standing in the shop.  The sale was over.  Don't waste your time coming to this place.  There are literally 100s of better options in the LA area.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>First of all, I'm upset I'm even required to leave 1 star in order to write this review. I have never written a review for any business on Yelp before, but my experience was so outrageous that I am compelled to now. My mom has been here at least twice and has had fairly good experiences. We had two vouchers for 90 minute massages and decided since I was in town for the day to have a nice mother daughter spa day. So at 10:30 am this morning, my mom and I booked two massages for 4PM. On our drive there we hit some traffic and called at 2:30 to see if we could push back the appointments to 4:15. The receptionist said it wasn't possible so we said we'd do our best to be there at 4, she said ok. We beat traffic and arrive at 4PM, after driving 80, YES EIGHTY, miles to get there. After sitting for a while and filling out all the paperwork we are told that our appointments were for 1PM and that we missed them. We tell her she is wrong and has made a mistake and she goes back to her computer clicking around while we sit and have no idea if we're getting massages now or not. She comes back and again keeps repeating that our appointments were at 1. She insists she tried calling us over and over again to confirm the appointment yet we have no missed calls or voicemails from her. I bring up the point that when we spoke to her at 2:30PM she made no mention of us missing our appointment and even said she'd see us as soon as we could get there. She had no response to me pointing this out and instead continued to repeat that our appointments were at 1. She would not apologize and would not admit she made a mistake. She eventually found 2 available masseuses, but one of them was not with the person we specifically requested. Given that at this point we had already missed almost 15 minutes of our massage and she had given no apology whatsoever, we thought it only right that the 2nd massage be on the house. She said she would not do that so we instead asked for a refund. She said she could not do that because she didn't have the cash. The place is a cash only store.... When I pointed this out she said she didn't have the power to give a refund. We asked her to call her boss and for about 5-10 minutes and she straight up refused and said she had no way of calling him. Finally another person came out and said right away that they could call the boss. We spoke to the boss and explained the situation and he asked to speak to the receptionist, they spoke for about 5-10 minutes, again with us having no idea what was happening and wasting our time. Finally she gave us our money back. Still with no apology. We drove 80 miles for this to have a nice day on my 1 day in town visiting from the east coast and instead we left more tense than before we even scheduled the massages. Although the owner did the right thing in the end, it was the most unbelievable customer service I have ever witnessed or experienced. And truthfully, had she acknowledged and apologized for her mistake and our inconvenience we would have happily accepted the two appointments and paid for them with our vouchers as planned, even with the massage therapist we did not schedule with. But instead, because of the unbelievably poor customer service, we will be driving another 80 miles home for nothing other than a horribly un relaxing experience. My mom will never schedule another massage here out of fear that she will drive for hours only to find she has no appointment. it was unbelievable and such a disappointment.<//Text>< user_name>

<Review>These guys seem great. We had a really nice gentleman help us find plants that met our needs, like drought tolerant and dog friendly. He was very knowledgeable, I wish we had gotten his name. They have a really big selection and lots of people there to help.</Review>< Response>

If you have a schedule that you need to keep I would NOT RECOMMEND THESE GUYS AT ALL!!  I OWN A LANDSCAPING COMPANY CALLED CUTTING EDGE.
Okay so I go to order decomposed granite and flagstone for a customer. I was able to order the decomposed granite the same day but the flagstone was coming in later that week according to the guy at the front desk who took my payment for the decomposed granite. We did not hear from them for the rest of the week so we called the following Monday and again they told us it would be in that week so now I'm waiting another week for the flagstone. Come Friday I have not heard back from affordable Rock so we give them a call and they tell us it will be in by lunch time. Still did not hear back from them all day so we call again at the end of Friday and they tell us it should be in by the morning. it is now Monday morning and they are not answering my calls. This is very bad business and customer service and it makes other businesses look bad that have jobs lined up. I would not recommend using these guys if you have a schedule that you need to keep.<//Review>

This is a great place. It has many rock selections, the staff is really helpful. If they don't have what you're looking for they can give great options or see if they can get it for you.</text>

(Translated by Google) It has plants for indoors and outdoors and at 5 dollars a stone bucket and you can choose the stones, whether they are from the little ones, big ones, they have variety and they speak Spanish 😄👍👍

(Original)

Outstanding gourmet hotdogs with mouthwatering flavor and all sort of toppings. They also offer fries and burgers and a cool beer or drink and you can sit and watch the ocean and enjoy the fabulous food. One of the best dogs I have ever had!</Text>

Love me a darn good gourmet Mexican hot dog. My favorite is the TJ doggo. I top it off with a side of their garlic cheese fries before taking a walk down the beach. The staff is always very nice and accommodating.<//Text>

Awesome awesome spot. Not a typo, it is indeed a double dose of awesome. Solid beef dogs and bacon wrapped with a plethora (take that 9th grade English) of toppings to go with. Burgers and shakes look amazing too but I haven't had 10 servings of each their dogs yet to venture to the other side of the menu. In due time!< /review>

<review>Was looking forward to eating hereUnfortunately the service was not what we were hoping for.They were rude and had no mannersWe wanted to order a drink but they did not want to even botherTo see if they had any white claws left. It seemed like they did not care if they had our service or not. Overall service was really bad, There’s always a kind way to say things especially to new customers.<//review>< time>

Spotted this place a while back, but they were closed at the time. Finally had the opportunity to try them, and I'll definitely be back to try more exciting menu items. Friendly employees, and very clean inside and out. Check them out, you won't regret it!< /review>

Gourmet hot dogs right on Seacoast Drive.
My favorite is the Surf n Turf with fat shrimp and carne asada, crispy cheese.
The burgers are great to, as are the garlic fries.
Wash it down with a mint cucumber drink and finish with a pineapple Dole whip. (When the machine is working) Service is always pleasant too!< /review>< pics>

It took over 10 minutes to make my hotdog with one person ahead of me so I was a little annoyed but all was forgiven when I received my surf n turf hot dog as it was delicious. The shrimp was fresh and juicy and I definitely felt a lot of care and attention went into a "mere" hotdog. The wait was definitely worth the product and I highly recommend giving it a try.<//Text>

This spot is incredible! Located right by the water. The people are friendly and to say the food is delicious would be an understatement! The chili dog with bacon is to die for. Highly recommend this restaurant! 5 Stars!< /Review>

My hubby ordered the TJ Dog and I had the Surf n Turf Dog. We both also ordered a cup of corn, everything had the right amount of ingredients for a perfection taste. Last but not least we both had a michelada with Pacífico beer 🍻 and they were to die for.
Best food and micheladas !!
Can't wait to go back for more.<//Review>

Always fun and genuine service. Great to meet friends for breakfast and local police frequent the place and their conversations are always amazing. It may be a millennial dish, but get the avocado mash. The curry oil makes it an epic dish and the red baked eggs are spicy and to die for.< /Review>

<Text>I don’t always eat hot dogs, but when I do, they need to have bacon. This trendy spot located in the heart of Imperial Beach is definitely the spot to go to for a premium gourmet hot dog.

This place has *GOOD HOTDOGS*. Bacon-wrapped regular or jumbo. I had the surf and turf jumbo and the fries were really good. My buddy tried the carnitas dog and said it was awesome. It is also the best seller. There is value here people! Drop in and try the food. Ask for Maya for the best service 👍😉</review>

This was our first visit this weekend and the hubby and I split the California Jumbo dog (bacon wrapped with grilled onions, shoe string fries, and avocado sauce) and the Surf and Turf Jumbo dog (with shrimp, sautéed peppers and some sort of chipotle sauce). We also shared a cup of elote (Mexican corn) with hot Cheetos!  The hot dogs, soft grilled buns, and corn were ALL very delicious.

<text>An imaginative reconsideration of what a hot dog can be.  Was it Mexican, as the name implies?  Well, maybe.  But regardless, it was good.  A very tasty hot dog loaded with onions and peppers, avocado and several sauces.  The fries were also reimagined in a similar way.  And equally tasty.  Just across the street from the beach and one of the least expensive meals on that street.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.< /text>< username>

<review>Hotdogs and Beer!

You'll be lucky to find a bar where they offer a single hotdog on their menu. This place has 5 different ones! With a choice of classic dog or gourmet sausage, along with many other hotdog centric appetizers, there is bound to be something to satisfy your hotdog craving. They also offer other traditional bar food as well.

I ordered the Sonoran and Carnitas classic with a side of tots. Both were great but don't order two. One is plenty to get full from. The toppings are served high atop a large classic style dog wrapped in bacon placed in soft grilled bun. The bacon could probably have been cooked a little longer for my preference. The bun was perfect, almost as soft as a Hawaiian roll.

The tots were great! Really crispy/crunchy and seasoned with a spiced fine salt.

Service was very friendly, attentive and fast.

I will definitely return to try their gourmet sausage and a pint of beer during a ballgame.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGjjYLafp3FvZIMtw1CehN5bP7ryqlmtEBKFNf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO75W9EyMeaPjGEun3wv2Zf0nG3XjuZdo-8ruKY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0O2juFtiIREnoUZgNcpu33WG5CzDSAGI8kBtU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Amazing Hotdogs with bacon wrapped around them! Tried the Carnitas Guacamole Bacon Burger and I was blown away! My tatse buds scremed for joy. I ate the whole thing. Fries matched perfectly with great seasoning. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!!                   Remember to take a SEFLIE with El SEÑOR Dog for some great Tots!!

<text>Very disappointed with Doggogus tonight. Just went there a couple days ago for the first time and the burger and california dog i got were top notch. Me and my wife planned for a few days to have it again tonight for dinner.
Everything was completely different.
The burger had no house slaw on it and the patty tasted of strong overwhelming pepper. The california dog was like a different order altogether. It completely looked like a different dog then what was ordered the other day.
And those poor fries. Just a pure soggy potato noodle. Just pure disappointment. Was raving about to my family the other day and this changed everything. Probably wont be going back again.
Only good part was the service. Very nice people. But very sad food.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1589722629242, 'text': 'Hi thank you very much for your review.\nIm glad you enjoyed Doggosgus the first time you came.

Good food open when we went by. They were very accommodating and made an absolutely plain dog for a three year old and I had a delicious burger.</Review>

Doggo's has the best, delicious, huge tasting hot dogs. I been scheduling them for the apartment complex where I work, and the residents at our complex love  these hot dogs. Gustavo the owner has great customer service, and is always a pleasure to have them around.< /review>

My company hired Doggos Gus for our anniversary picnic this year and everything was absolutely great. We had tacos, street corn, bacon-wrapped dogs & churros for about 100 people. They brought 2 set-ups and about 10 employees making it super easy for everyone to grab food quickly. In addition, only 2 drinks were included in the package we purchased, however, Gustavo and his team brought all 3 available drinks and kept everything topped off. Everyone was super pleased with the food & the quality of the services rendered. Will definitely consider them for any future events.</Text>

<Text>Absolutely delicious! Had the mutt dog and filthy fries. Both were so good I craved it the following week and got it again. The lobster bun is definitely worth the extra cost. It gives it a crispy texture and adds a nice sweetness to the overall flavor. The bf got the brown dog and house dog which was also good.< /Text>< pictures>

They are at cinco by the Bay and wont take the food tickets for VIP. Ran out of half the stuff, including the bacon and still try and charged $5 for a hotdog. The guys working the stand said the owner said not to honor the tickets for the event.  Avoid at all cost, money Hungary! As you can see its the only vender without a line.</text>

<Review>Gold standard CORN DOG, Think of the best freshest corn dog you've ever had, this is better, Staff is very courteous and truly love their hot dogs. A feast for the eyes first, then a pleasure to eat. I've never seen such a beautiful poppy-seed coated bun. Excellent prices and a very quaint outdoor eating area.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
When the Costco food court was temporarily closed up in Carlsbad, Doggos Gus came up and had their food truck set up. That was my first taste of their yummy Baja hotdogs. Now I make a special trip 25 miles away to go get my hotdog fix when I can. Bacon wrapped hot dogs with grilled onions, an avocado sauce, and a spicy sauce. Delicious!<//Review>

The avo egg burger was sooo good. Just creamy when the yolk, avo and sauces mix. I would definitely go to this truck again and get the same burger! The meat and Doggosgus were really good too! Juicy patty and a buttery Doggosgus.< /Review>

<Text>I attended a Yelp Brewventure at The Lost Abbey and got to taste Doggos Gus hot dog for the first time, mind blown, it reminded me DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES show from Food network. Thanks to these guys for the catering, they took the event to the next level. I would recommend them for the catering for any event, Kids birthday party to Superbowl party.

Doggus Gus was on Fire, making on of the best hot dogs in the town. I will call them for my next catering need. Their bacon wrapped hotdogs was worth standing in the line again and again :)

These hot dogs taste so good, especially with great beer. The caters working non-stop for hours tireless with super energy. I plan on booking them for our next event and praying that my next event will have them :)

I added the extra GRILLED ONIONS on my Hot dog which made extra delicious also Chorizo Mayo with bacon dog is totally worth the calories and the smell of the entire grill is yumm.</Text>< rate>

Very efficient staff at your Stockton location.  Seems cars are at a real shortage, and even though we didn't get OUR EXACT REQUEST for a vehicle, we got a comparable ride at a fair price.<//text>

<text>Based on safety, NO WAY! I will not refer anyone to this Avis location. While driving away not even 4 feet from parking space the tire rolled off the front left side of the car and as my husband put the car in park we were shocked and in disbelief to see that the tire had just rolled off the vehicle. We got out of the car we noticed the tire on the front right was bent and just about to come off too. When the mechanic or the guy that cleans the cars noticed what had happened he asked us, ”didnt you not see the tires loose before driving off, ” as if it was our fault that this happened. I mean when one rents a car from a reputable company you trust and believe you are in good hands. The last thing we thought of before getting into the car after inspecting for minor dents or scratches is to check the tires to see if all the bolts are on each tire. That's not our job. What rental company expects their customers to check if the tires are bolted and safe before getting in the car! Ridiculous! The car is suppose to be inspected before your customers drive off. Had my husband drove off the lot and on to the streets and this happened, there is no telling what physical damage or horrible accident this could have caused. We've been renting from this location for a long time because we like the main guy who handles the paperwork. He’s very knowledgeable of travel destinations and refers you to a lot of nice places him and his wife have travelled to, but this was not about customer service. This is about one's safety. Making sure my family is safe when driving one of Avis cars. Yes, we went ahead with the reservations and we were given another car, because we needed a car and had to get on the road to be on time for our travel plans. But even the second car that was given to us was a good car and good on gas, but when we'd park the car and get out of the vehicle there was a burning smell. Not sure what that was, but again it put a doubt in my mind if we were going to have a problem with getting back home safely. 👎<//text>< pics>

It takes quite some time because of Covid-19 so it's understandable. I would recommend they have a canopy or two in front so people have shade to wait under while waiting in line. A few times I was out in the hot sun for over 30 mins just waiting... Other than that the cars they have are good and the people who work there are respected and kind.

< Review>
Poor customer service.  The store Closes at 3:00 pm called to tell them that I would be there at 3:05 and if they could wait for me.  Manager told me flat out no and to pick up tomorrow.  I tried to explain to the manager I needed the car to get to work tomorrow since my car literally just broke down and I had to have towed to the shop.  know I was late but I honestly needed a helping hand and Avis could have cared less.  Very sad that companies no longer pride themselves on doing the right things when people need it.< /Review>

Think twice before renting at this location and be sure to allow a full hour to receive service. Rented vehicle - car fob would not lock/unlock car. radio did not work and car dirty. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</review>

<review>I normally dont share, but omg is this place crooked. Im a vet, they offer vet discounts so i use avis a lot, but this location has stolen from me 2x. The most recent i booked 5 days, ended up needing a 6th (this is at least 90 days out). So i call and ask to modify my reservation to add the additional day, well they make an entire new reservation and charge me the cancellation fee for the last after telling me it was only like 21$ difference.....won’t be working with you thieves again.<//review>< Pictures>

Renting cars that are not cleaned in the midst of this pandemic. Car with gas light on rented. Very disappointed with thw service at this location. I was pretty sure rental car places are advertising that the cars are cleaned and disinfected. Unfortunately, this is just a play on words.<//text>

The staff at the location were very polite and helpful. I made my reservation over the phone and they charged me for 2 days instead of 1 day and I even returned the car 2 hours before the 24 hour mark. So basically I payed $150 for a car I had for less then 24 hours. Then I called the company to get a refund and the first representative I talked to flat out told me “no” he would not give me the refund and when I asked to talk to someone else he told me to hang up and call again because he would not transfer me. Very Rude! So I called again and the woman who helped me was very polite and was able to process the refund but before she gave me a confirmation number, she hung up on me. So I had to call for a third time. Let me also mention that before you talk to a representative you get to go through this long and difficult automated robot and it took forever to get to talk to an actual human being. The third representative helped me, gave me the refund, and was very helpful. The woman who made my reservation, Carolina, over charged me and failed to give me necessary information needed for my reservation.<//text>

Horrible experience when returning the car. We booked with Avis after talking to a woman representative that was kind, helpful and treated so well. We were in a sudden situation when my husbands car broke down and we needed a vehicle immediately to be able to go see our daughter at Stanford Hospital (less than a week ago she had a double lung transplant).

We were able to get the car, get checked out, and feel good about the service (prior loyal Hertz renters, but they had no cars due to busy holiday week). We felt like maybe Avis could be a new go-tonfor our rentals.

We were assured we could return the car Sunday between their small open window (11am-1pm) and so on Sunday we filled the car to half (same as what we received it with) and went to return it. We got there at 12pm. Right in the middle of the window we were told to return the car.

Immediately jokes about charging is extra for. It parking it in the right spot. We laughed. Then a comment that we didn’t fill the tank. We assured the man we are returning it same as it was provided to us. Then came the...

“You need to pay a full day as you are an hour late returning the vehicle.”

We calmly explained that the woman told us to return between 11-1pm.

Arguing began with him saying she would never have said that and saying it will be another full day rental. We calmly repeated what we were told and asked if he could check with staff because it was what she told us. He refused. It was horrible.  Accused of lying, not verifying what was told and really... 1 hour and he chose to fight new customers?

We still calmly stated that the woman was awesome and kind and now we feel like the experience was going from great to horrible in a flash. He was ride and continued to argue and tell us we are wrong. My husband said we are new customers and will NEVER be back. And I agree :(

Car was great, although smelled of pot. Woman was great and wish we could have continued to work with her :( the man (manager?) Nothing short of horrible.

Avis?! Was it worth it?< /text>

<review>Very pleased with the great service I received from this Avis location; Renee was so helpful during a very difficult situation when I had to extend my car rental due to my Mother's extended hospital stay.  She was friendly, helpful, empathetic, and very professional as she worked to get the best pricing for me.  I really appreciated her going above and beyond to make one less thing stressful during a very stressful time.</review>< Pics>

My aunt and I just got the worse service here at Avis in Stockton, CA we literally just got tazted out the business. the "owner" older gentleman who said he owns the business was so poorly trained and so freaking rude to the point of raising his voice  we had to call the cops on the owner not for the fact of raising his voice but for the fact that as we was walking out "kick out" he started to brandish his tazer I will  and never rent a car from this Avis again. PPL PLEASE FIND ANOTHER LOCATION AND ABOID BEING TAZED.</Review>

I had a great experience with Avis.  I generally rent from the company with the lowest rate and easiest access.  Because of this experience, I will check Avis first when the the rental selection decision is mine to make.  Thanks for a great experience.< /text>

OMG now it all makes sense! Coming from yelp and finding 2 1/2 stars makes absolute sense. I went there to return a car my brother which doesn’t speak english rented at Avis the night before. After getting stuck on a $207 a day agreement for a toyota, I tried talking to them about doing something to get it cheaper since it was a steal to pay that much for what it was a less than 24 hour deal. One of the guys was nice trying to explain, but right away another old guy, maybe middle eastern man, came with a horrible attitude saying that the price was normal. I was surprised he said $207 a day for a toyota was normal and I asked him if he made $30k a month to make that statement. $207 a day is more than $6k a month for a car!! Whatta joke!!
He said I make $100k a year, and I responded “if you make that much money (which I seriously doubt) you should be fire for the horrible customer service you offer. I am not talking about the price of the car, I am talking about his attitude behind the desk. Instead of helping us he was rude an inappropriate. Having 30 employees in my company, if one of my employees behind a desk talks to a mad customer like he did to me, he would have his final check the day after. Fired!!!!!
Anyways, read the reviews!! Good luck with these thieves!!< /text>

<Review>It was a horrible experience. I will never go back again. Not professional at all. When I received the rental, i already reserved it, and paid. My problem. But when I received the card it was filthy. It wasn't washed and it wasn't vacuumed.  Mind you if you return the car and it is dirty. They charge you $250.00. On to your bill. I received the car dirty. And asked for a clean car. They said they had nothing left, and I was stuck with the one I got. So I said ok fine. I bring back a week later they try to charge me $250.00for the car being dirty. The same way I got it I brought it back that way. So they tried to charge $250.00 on top of the $400.00 for the week. I said no. The guy who gave me the keys n rental said he would make note and to worry I'm in good hands. Yeah rite. So as I'm paying to close account for rental he tried to charge the 250.00 for the car dirty. I said no I'm not paying that.  That how I got it. He said yes you are, I'm charging your car. I said no I talk to the man before. He said that guy got fired. I said sir I'm not paying for that. I'AN m sorry I only drove to work an home. I wasn't in the car long enough to make a mess. I'm not gonna pay. So he started to get LOUD with me . We're going back n forth. His wife comes out. And says jus don't charge her. There is note look. So I got yelled and screamed at because he didn't read the notes on the screen. Never again will I go back. And never again will I referral a friend there.

<Review>I had very good experience with avis before I rent a car from this agency
they don't clean inside the cars
I rent a car for a week, my car had problems and made alert, when I returned the car they accepted the problem and when I ask for one more day because that problem force me to return, they told me there was no problem and the alert is normal
they behavior was so bad and they clearly told me you lie
I never choose avis again and try other car rentals like enterprise or ....< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Good food and good service. Try the traditional menu. Meals are a little more than typical American Chinese prices but very well priced for the large portion sizes and can easily be shared.< /Review>

< Review>
Been going there for years. Not a lot of Chinese places in Escondido. This is mostly American style Chinese, but you can find something you like even if not authentic. Usually fast service. Higher priced than many Chinese places. We only go there if we don't want to drive further. I really like the dining room ambience.</Review>

But Chan's is the only place we go for Chinese around here. The service is excellent and they all know us and can't beat that. The food is excellent but we recommend you ask for the Chinese version of the menu if your into that :)<//Review>< rate>

Great food here at Chan's. I know I can get consistently good shangahi food here. They even made the Chinese breakfast food my daughter loves when we went there for dinner tonight after she made the request when ordering.<//Text>

<review>Dated decor in need of new paint. First waiter was rude, rushed and threw our food on the table. Towards the end of the meal a waitress took over and was much better. Food was greasy. Egg rolls literally dripped oil. Beef with scallops had a sauce that overwhelmed the subtle flavor of the scallops.</review>< gmap_id>

I went to Chans had carry out of house fried rice and house soft noodles.  I loved both those dishes. They both have large shrimp, chicken and beef all tender. Plus as a side I had cream cheese wontons and pork stickler/pork dumplings.  These were both great as well.  I will always go back there!!  Thanks for having great food<//text>

I had a great lunch at Chins San Marcos.  I liked the kung pao chicken. I was very tasty, usually other places give it too much soy sauce.  Under $8 for lunch. I'll come for dinner soon.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Very rude service. Waitress even went to look at the bill and see how much I tipped while we were still sitting at the table; she scoffed, even though I still gave 20% for bad service. Waitress was more attentive to Chinese speaking customers.

Will not go back.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Service was not good, but the food was delicious. However, I was charged for crispy noodles without being told there would be a charge which in the past they didn't do when it was Chin's.< /text>

Stopped by about a month ago to eat. This family owned business has amazingly tasting ice cream.

I also usually order the tortas as well.

They offer a diverse menu and the food is delicious as well.

Next time I stop by I will post more pictures of the food that they make.< /text>

<review>My family and I come to this establishment all the time. I get the mangonadia very frequently sometimes a few times a week. My kids will get ice creams or milkshakes and my husband gets a milkshake. We are good paying customers. Tonight at  about 7:10 pm my husband went in to get me a mangonadia and the lady there refused to make it! This is not the first time either! She has refused to make stuff for us 2 other times. I feel like I am being treated differently because I am white. They do not close until 11 there is no reason she could not make the mangonadia period. That is no way to treat a good paying customer. Very unprofessional and needs to be fixed ASAP. THEY are going to loose some very good customers.<//review><user>110230486671315058643</user>< pictures>

I've came here a few times and finally decided to rate it. Their drinks arent very good. The icecream is okay the only thing is it has lots of pieces of ice from the freezer around it and it affects the icecreams taste. I've gotten the tostiloco and each time it's been good & so has their fruit! The main reason I am upset about this place is because of being robbed at times. 3 times I went here the lady overcharged me. The first time I spoke up and she gave me the difference. The second I was just kinda weirded out it happened again but I didnt say anything cause it was only a dollar. I did notice this happened late at night close to closing each time so I dont know if she tries to sneak away with an extra little charge or is just tired. The third time I didnt argue about the extra 2 dollar overcharge I was over it and just figured oh well keep it but she lost a customer over it.<//review>

It was my first time there and I have to say, it looked really nice and clean, they have so many choices which are great for days like these lol Unlike the other paletería, I got my money's worth here 🤗 The person that helped me out greeted me as I came in even though she was with another customer and kept letting me know she would be right with me, which are things the other place never did, it was a very delightful change!  I recommend it honestly 😊< /Review>

I do not go back to this place the simple snow without flavor, the palettes seemed to be thawed and frozen again because they had ice inside, nothing creamy ... and also expensive! Very friendly but I did not like it! I hope you review your product before selling it! .

Fui hace unos días por unas bolitas de nieve y paletas!  No vuelvo a ir a este lugar las nieves  simple sin sabor , las paletas parecían que se les avían  descongelado y y congelado de nuevo porque tenían hielo adentro, nada de cremosas ..  y además caras! Muy amables pero no me gusto! z espero que revisen su producto antes de venderlo! .< /review>

I always stop at this Jack Box when traveling down South. They always get my order right. I love their fresh salsa cups. I always ask for 2 and that is what I get. If there is a line, it moves quickly.</Text>

< Review>
We used mobile ordering,  went through the drive  through.  Stopped in the parking lot to check our order. Order was incomplete, called the restaurant let them know. Asked them to bring out the missing items. Was told to come in the lobby. Waited in the lobby, and waited. Asked to talk to the manager. No joy. Finally got my food.  Asked for owners information.  Was given a phone number.  Called to complain.  Wasn't the right number. Some random person.< /Review>

What was good? Service was excellent, and the bathroom was extremely clean. If I'm back in the area, I'll have to try the hamburger.< /text></record>

<Review>Waited for 10-15 minutes to finally get service. Food was cold. The worst part was the flies were all over the place. I have to use my burger carton as a fan to blow them away. They ran out of drinks, only water and high c. Over all, a crappy place.<//Review>< pictures>

The store is kind of a hit or miss in food quality or customer service.< /review>

My husband’s golf club ... I’m there only occasionally. It’s beautiful and my husband says the course is challenging. He enjoys playing there and has made some good friends.

Staff are very nice ... especially the dining room and bar servers!< /Review>

If you're looking to play on a golf course that is more challenging than most courses in the LA area than this is the one. Try it out and see for yourself. Good luck.</Text>

<text>Super impressed with this course.  Greens are very receptive, tee boxes and fairways in good shape, and the layout is interesting.  The front 9 and back 9 also felt like 2 different courses so it's challenging. Facilities are clean. Range balls are always new and unlimited.  Two putting greens, one flat, one undulating.  And a short game area that is great.  I've had dinner there twice, and I've enjoyed the food at the restaurant.  Service is always polite and professional .  Also, best chips and salsa I've ever had.  The snack shop has great hot dogs and cool drinks.  They allow daily play on Mondays but for the most part it is a private club.  Every member I've met truly loves the club, and I can understand why.< /text>< pictures>

<Name>Thizzelle Washington<//Name><gmapID>0x80c2d34468b5a76d:0x9c3743f648fc1303</gmapID><Text>Been a member here for about a year and can't recommend it enough. The course is always in flawless condition (the greens are fast!) but the best part of all is the lack of crowds. You almost never need to make a tee time and the biggest selling point for me is that I can count on playing a 3.5 - 4 hour round every time I come out and if I am playing by myself it takes me just over 3 hours.

I would recommend this club to anyone. I was surprised how affordable it was. I pay $425/month and get to play unlimited rounds of golf. I was definitely spending more than that to play my local muni courses and they dont even come close to comparing to candlewood.

If you are interested in joining a private club do yourself a favor and look into candlewood.</Text>< date>

<Review>I’ve been here pre-Covid and the food was good when dining in, however the past two times that I ordered take out the food was sub par, most recently the chicken Parmesan I ordered. The vegetables tasted like they were frozen and I could barely cut through the chicken. It didn’t seem fully cooked. I ended up throwing it out after two bites and remained hungry. The time prior, the calzone was too doughy and the ice tea was poured from a store bought bottle vs. fresh brewed. ☹️ It seemed like such a quaint little place when I first came here, but now, I doubt I will go back.<//Review>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1621190217317, 'text': 'Sorry to disappoint you Mona. I’ll be sure to pass on your dissatisfaction to Jimmy and Ben (the people who cooked your food). The vegetables are cut daily, never frozen so not sure what happened there and the chicken is fried and baked so maybe it was too cooked for your liking (definitely not undercooked). You are correct, our ice tea is not freshly brewed and we’ve never claimed it was. For future reference, just let us know you didn’t like the food and we’d be happy to give you a full refund. 😊'}<//resp><gmap_id>0x80ece30be05dc667:0x5b5a9f41d3021b93< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Best Italian food in the whole county. Fried ravioli appetizer just wonderful. Had the Manicotti in a homemade pasta, to die for. A must place to eat (if you love real Italian food)<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I ordered take-out from here on a Friday night and it was ready for pick up in 20min! Two salads; one house and one Caesar(the real kind with an anchovy on top!) along with the Carbonara and Cannelloni. Talk about a flavorful feast!! Everything as on point and I look forward to ordering again.</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pictures>

<review>The food was totally Awesome😋
Puttanesca with sausage and linguini, and the same with spaghetti, salad with anchovies and bread and butter. This place had people coming and going one after another!!! Diana was Absolutely great with keeping the customers and their orders taken care of and safe with all the things to do with this pandemic going on. This was the best Italian food I've had and the service was excellent thanks to Diana. My compliments to the Chef also 😋. I highly recommend this place !!! Prices are very, very reasonable also and huge portions too. Thanks again to Diana, the Chef and anyone else that's running this establishment.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

From the friendly Wait-staff to the Chef, this place is the best dining in the County.  The entire menu is high quality flavor town and the Friday night special of Linguine, shrimp and bay scallops keeps me coming back often.<//Review>

Really authentic, cozy atmosphere home feel service. The linguine with scallop and shrimps in cream sauce were outstanding. The calzones were ok, if you like the ricotta, mozzarella blend. We had the sausage and olive one and asked to add artichoke hearts, which they did. Pizzas and salads looked really good too. We will go there again.<//review>

<text>First time coming across this place as I'm somewhat new to the area. I was really happy to discover an Italian restaurant in the neighborhood and grabbed some take out, however, my first experience was underwhelming. The breaded ravioli was decent but didn't seem very fresh, probably just microwaved. The pasta was a bit disappointing. It's hard to go wrong with pasta with oil and garlic but this one was bland and not at all tasty. The vegetable mix didn't go well together, maybe because of the overall bland taste and the fact that the dish was cold. The portion was also super small for the price and what it was. The bread was good, so there's that. I thought as I ate it might be a place I would try again, but then my stomach started feeling upset and I had to stop eating my meal. Now it's an hour later and I'm left super hungry. Money down the drain and on top of that I'll have to cook my own meal afterall.< /text><gmapID>0x80ece30be05dc667:0x5b5a9f41d3021b93< /gmapID>< rating>

I was raised in an Italian family and my mother and grandmother were both fantastic cooks so I am kind of picky about Italian food. But I have never been disappointed with the food at Jimmy Bumps. Their food is authentic Italian and the sauces aren't too heavy... try the clam linguine with red sauce or the butternut squash ravioli with butter sage sauce. You will be back for more.</text>

My wife and I went here for dinner. We are from out of town, but found the reviews favorable. The service was great, considering there was only one poor waitress for the whole dining room. She did a wonderful job despite her work load.

Food was delicious. We had a calzone and butternut squash, and neither disappointed us. Lots of flavor and quality ingredients made this a great meal.

The only negative on the experience was the decor. It could really use an upgrade, however I highly recommend this place.< /Review>

Traditional Family Italian restaurant.  If you are from New York City or San Francisco, you will remember what you have been missing all these years. Food is almost as good as your old family restaurant maybe better and it doesn't have the families yelling because it is too small. Leave Olive Garden for the populist and keep Jimmy Bump a secret for my sake hahaha. Seriously I want to see a line and a "must have" reservation for  Jimmy Bump's.</Review>

<review>My review is regarding the aroma from Jimmy's which was deliciously intoxicating and created feelings if not only regret but of anger for not knowing Jimmy's was there next to the sadly inadaquent ramen restaurant we unfortunately were suffering at. The 5 stars is for the lovely savory herbs wafting over making the poorly concepted ramen served to us wretched and inedible.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< UserId.>

Quality italian cuisine that rivals small Italy!

I was there in this sleepy old Town and we came across this italian bistro, we ordered pesto spaghetti, Sunday gravy fettuccine, minestrone soup and fried cheese sticks, all with beverages only cost $40. But this restaurant provides far more value then fine diners and taste better. The minestrone soup we had a balance of taste of not exceedingly salty while all veggies are sufficiently cooked just to taste good. As their name suggested, spaghettis are their strength, and the Sunday gravy is a must try, looks like tomate with meat only, but far more then that. When you taste the sauce you can feel the herbs that came from the meat, not so much that it overtake the whole disc, able to keep it to the meat only, fettuccine is well cooked and had a light taste of olive, taste of all of them are in perfect balance, plus is hot enough so u will feel good. Never expect so much from such a humble restaurant!<//text>

I would love to give Jimmy Bumps 5 stars but I feel I would be misleading. The food is consistently good but not exceptional compared to other Italian restaurants in the county; however, it's excellent if you want to stay in the Los Osos/Morro Bay area. The service we have experienced each time is very borderline. The lead waitress/hostess can come off as though she's doing you a favor to wait on you, even to regular customers. She presents with a certain tone of indifference much of the time, and that type of reception is very off putting to the customers. I will say that the restaurant looks to be hiring more help. I hope the new staff bring a less abrupt vibe to the customers. One suggestion, if you like eggplant, order the eggplant parm. It's delicious!</text>

If you think that good Italian food comes from cans, this place is for you.

If you think an Italian restaurant should make their own sauce, go somewhere else.< /review>

Great service. The service technician, Ata, was informative and did a great job installing our garage door opener. He answered any questions I had and took away the debris from our ancient garage door opener. Highly recommend this business.< /Review>

Asher (Sacramento) came out for a repair.  Was on time.  Extremely polite.  Very knowledgeable. And absolutely helped me out! Went above and beyond to make sure that BOTH my garage doors were working properly.  I'll need to replace my garage door opener here soon and buy another one, and will certainly work with Asher and Ace's again!  Thank You!</text>

The appointment was made through my home warranty. Ace's Garage Door called me on the next business day and scheduled the repair for the day after. Asher arrived within the time frame provided and fixed the garage door opener. He was courteous, professional, knowledgeable  and very capable. He also provided me with a quote for a new garage door since the existing one will need to replaced. Very impressed.</review>

Nathan was a great guy. He had excellent customer service. He was very professional and got right to work installing my new garage opener. Once completed he went over all the features in great detail and showed me how everything worked. Any questions I had he was willing to give me a quick demonstration to asnwer my question. I will definitely recommend Nathan and Ace's garage door repair and installation to all of my friends and family.</text>

< review>
Fantastic service! Just bought a home and the garage door opener seemed to be dysfunctional. Mike arrived, took a look and quickly determined the problem was a complete lack of maintenance. Mike replaced rollers and adjusted the sensors and everything is fine. I recommend Ace's and will use them in the future if there is a need.< /review>

<Text>ALEX was the best!!! He repaired my springs on my wood huge door. Although it took a few days to get them ready, he worked his hardest to be responsive and do it a quick manner. He also gave us a part that was very much needed for free, and tried to help us save money in every way possible. Not only that, he finish the job at 8 pm. I appreciate his coordination and determination to do proper work in a cost efficient manner. Will most definitely work with Aces in the future. Most honest company I have worked with.

We had a car stuck in the way and even thought that happened he was able to do the job.  We are glad it was him that came he was helpful and kind.  He was so respectful the whole time and it made it feel like we were being helped by a good friend.  He was kind and told us everything we needed to know from the start.  He helped us and he not only did it right he did it in a reasonable amount of time.  He was also here on time witch was great.  He had on a mask the whole time even thought it’s very hot outside and we are very thankful he helped us.  We are glad that we had his assistance cause I don’t think there would be anyone better.  I just want him to know we are thankful and did a great job.  I would recommend him and this company to anyone with a garage.</Text>< Pictures>

Nathan is the man!! He came out, was on time, very knowledgeable and  got the garage door working properly in quick order. He even did a little adjustment on our second door that improved the function of the door, at no extra charge. In addition he found a broken hinge on that same door, which would have resulted in a big problem had he not found it. Our door is over 20 years old and not made anymore, however he somehow was able to order 2 new hinges, and installed them today, and we are back in business.
It is very refreshing to find service like this today.  On top of  that Nathan is very friendly and fun to talk to.  I  would use Ace's Garage Door and Nathan any day!!!!<//text>

<text>Garage door suddenly went off the rails last night and wouldn't close. Called up Ace at about 8:30am this morning and had a tech Nathan out maybe an hour later. Nathan was awesome! Super communicative and efficient and got our garage door on track and working properly. I don't leave many reviews but my experience here has been stellar. @Ace  - keep Nathan he represents everything you want in a company and thanks for getting us fixed!

<Text>My spring on my garage door broke yesterday so I called my home warranty company and they assigned the work to Ace's Garage Door Repair. I spoke to the office clerk who scheduled me appt the next next for repair between 1pm to 5pm.  The tech Nathan came out about 1:30pm and made the repair.  Nathan was very professional and knowledgeable of door repairs. Nathan was able to change out the spring, fix the roller and reprogram the remotes. Thanks Nathan, I would definitely recommend your company for anyone needing garage door repairs.<//Text>< pictures>

Nathan of Aces Garage Door Service, came by to evaluate some noises. Upon evaluation it was determined that most of the components were 15-20 years old. Nathan offered to stay a install a rebuild kit. I accepted and all I can say is WOW!
The door is so quiet now. Amazing.
Nathan was friendly, professional and courteous. We had some great conversation while he was working on the door. I most certainly recommend Aces and won’t hesitate to use them again in the future.</text>

I put in a service request on a Saturday afternoon and was immediately called back. A technician was sent to my house right away (arrived within 30 minutes) and the garage door was fixed within 30 minutes of the technician arriving. Nathan was very helpful and knowledgeable. He gave advice on preventative measures and made sure my garage door was in the best shape possible once he was finished with the job. I would recommend this company to anyone and will definitely use them again!</review>

We had an emergency. The garage door was old and came off the track. Expensive equipment was being stored in there.  It was a friday night. Ace's came out and quoted us a price for a new garage door with opener WiFi built in. They showed up Saturday early afternoon and were able to take down the old garage door set up the new one and hauled away the old broken one, in just a couple of hours! Im so greatful for these guys you don't even know! Beautiful job and beautiful door. Thanks Ace's! I will definitely recommend them to all my friends!</Text>

We had to have another part replaced on our garage door opener. Luckily Aces was dispatched to us again. Nathan was super friendly and got the repair done quickly and without hassle! It will probably be time to replace the entire unit soon and we will certainly be calling Aces to help us out.</Review>

The installer ,Red arrived on time and proceeded to do a fine job and took his time and showed me the new opener. He also cleaned up the worksite and helped move a few items I needed help with. Very positive experience over all .  And a shout out to Nathan for the initial consultation.<//Review>

We called Aces garage door to check out our opener that was smoking. Nathan arrived promptly and diagnosed the problem within seconds and gave us options to proceed with repair/replace. Ultimately he repaired the issue within minutes. He was awesome and we will call aces in the future for further maintenance if need be!< /text>

Came right after I called for service and repair done same day. Thanks Nathan.

Update: I had installed Liftmaster garage lasers and installed them myself to the garage door opener. They work great with the system but I had installed the wiring incorrectly. Nathan came out again and quickly diagnosed and solved the problem (I had made myself) with ease.

Everything works fine.

Thank you.< /Text>

< Review>
Nathan at Ace's Garage Door Repair in Roseville is absolutely Great! He came out to our home a week ago to fix our door &/or opener, but the darned opener worked just fine for the hour+ he was here. But he said contact him when it acts-up, which it did Sunday. Nathan and an associate were here Monday, saw the problems, tracked down the causes and replaced the opener...charging it to our AHS home insurance. We will always call Ace's...and Nathan, for garage door problems. G.C. in Citrus Heights</Review>

We were nervous based on all of the reviews dealt with Aces and home warranties,  but Nathan came out to our house less than 24 hours after we turned in our claim. He was extremely friendly (even gave a courtesy call when he was on his way). He was very helpful, knowledgeable,  and respectful.  Found the problem and fixed it within an hour. Cannot recommend Nathan enough!<//review>

After Nathan replaced the broken spring of our garage door, he convinced me to buy rollers for one side of the garage door opener. Then, after that, the left side of the door would not close at all. Which made the issue worse than it was before we contacted Ace's Garage Door Repair & Installation. Then he tells me I need a new track for left side of the garage door opener.  I contacted another company. They came by and adjusted the sensor and the track. In 15 minutes my garage door was working like it was before the spring broke.<//Review>

The chain on the garage door broke just one month after we were in our home. Our home warranty company used Ace's and we were able to get same-day service. Jeff arrived within the window of time promised and had everything fixed and working in 45 minutes.<//Text>

My car was trapped in my garage ! The door/opener was broken.
I called last night and Nathan was here at 8:00 to fix it. I’ll make my appointments on time today, thanks to Ace’s Garage Door and American Home Shield.<//review>

< Review>
John Calderon and his apprentice came to my rescue today! After a string of bad experiences with plumbers who were recommended to me or referred by my home warranty, I decided to venture out and find my own. Anderson Plumbing was the first to pop up and had the highest rating in San Diego. When I called, they answered immediately (last plumber hung up on me) and had someone at my door WITHIN AN HOUR (last plumber waited seven days before coming to my condo). John was so knowledgeable and friendly. (Both of them showed my dog lots of love, so bonus points there.) He was able to diagnose the problem immediately and even showed me the exact issue (so I knew he wasn’t just trying get me to replace a bunch of parts to drive up the cost). Although the fix was pricey, he was upfront about the cost and talked me through my options. They had the parts on hand to fix the water heater and waited until the hot water was running throughout the house before they left. Although larger companies can be a bit more expensive, it was 100% worth the extra money to use a reputable, legit company who came to my aid immediately and had a mini warehouse in their truck with everything they needed to fix the problem. Paying a couple extra bucks was worth avoiding the hassle I’ve been experiencing with 2-star rated companies who took a week to get here in the first place. John converted me to a loyal customer and I will only use Anderson Plumbing in the future. Also - John spoke volumes about the owners of the company and how generous they are with their employees and are wonderful people to work for — that’s the exact type of company I want to support!!< /Review>

You can trust them to listen, perform the repairs with professionalism, good humor and friendliness.  Thank You for having an excellent business in our San Diego community!</Review>< pics>

Anderson Plumbing is on my speed dial and will be out go to for all of our plumbing needs!

Great job, extremely pleased!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Gated valve failed on main irrigation valve. Digging required. First estimate came in at 535 for digging and replacement with 1/4 turn ball valve or plastic. Anderson came in at over 1500 for the same repair. I verified that it was the same exact repair. How can the same job cost $1000 more? It wasn't an emergency fix. How can prices vary so widely? Unbelievable. I guess OK in an emergency, but a grand more for a valve replacement? Are these industries regulated on prices? Seems like a free for all in the trades as far as prices. Just unreal.<//review><Time>1580780376144< /Time></record></dataset><record>
<Time>1619641473555<//Time><Text>Highly recommend Anderson for their excellent service, professionalism, and extremely competitive pricing. The repair tech was  here right on time, explained the situation completely, offered a few maintenance suggestions and put everything back in place when he was done. Will definitely use their services if/when the need arises.<//Text><user>111343854776132366641<//user><Rating>5< /Rating><pics>None</pics>< Name>

<Text>We had Rudy out to give us a second quote for drain repair and value replacement. He was fast efficient and honest. The qoute we had from the other guys was double the price and work. Anderson plumbing is the only company I trust for a fair honest price.<//Text>< date>

Leo and his assistant were friendly, helpful and professional. They were called in to fix a problem with my shower and water pressure. The repairs were made in a reasonable amount of time, and completed as detailed to me. I am very satisfied with the service and the individuals who performed the service. I am a repeat customer, and will continue to use Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air for my plumbing needs.<//review>

<Review>Re pipe of the gas system in my mobile home.
Drew, the technician did a great job replacing my old gas piping, risers and shutoffs.

The furnace, water heater are performing well.

The stove is not working at this time. I’m not sure what happened there?

Thank You Drew!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
We've used Anderson's before with good results.  This time they sent a self-professed "drain" guy to install a new kitchen faucet on a Friday.  On Saturday, we discovered a large leak under the sink.  I called customer service and the first answer was "we like to have the responsible installer do the repair, is that alright?"  Uh, no, what part of large leak don't you understand?  Turned out the earliest they could get anyone out was Monday!  All weekend appointments were "booked".  As a VIP member I expected better service than this when the leak was caused by their installer.
The gentleman who came on Monday initially intended to charge me for the visit, but backed off when I explained (again) who had caused the issue.  He was competent and knowledgeable and fixed the problem to our satisfaction, but I still contend that I shouldn't have had to spend the weekend with a leak that was caused by their employee.  And next time, if there is a next time, please don't send a DRAIN guy to do a PLUMBER'S job. I also told the dispatcher to have a Supervisor call me on Monday to discuss (no supervisor available on weekend).  That never happened.  This is not what I call VIP service.

Edited based on the prompt response I received from Erin in CS. She took responsibility,  both personally and as a company, for the issues I identified and resolved the situation to my satisfaction.< /review>

I wanted to do an update on my 5 star review. Change it to 1 star as I was charged 202 bucks to relight my water heater. I figured it was standard for the business but was shocked to learn was way overcharged. I was not present at the time. My girlfriend was and she definitely was taken advantage of. She was just happy to have hot water. Then I was given an estimate to replace a 2 year old water heater and they wanted 3300 bucks. You can get water heater for about 650 to 750 at home depot and get it installed for 200 bucks. This company really does wow with sticker price. Shocking. They did say they would apply the 202 towards install. Wow. Definitely do your research.<//text>

We have preferred service for the tankless water heater and scheduled for service today. Service technician arrive 3 1/2 hours after agreed upon time.
The water pressure was checked and read 150 psi which is above the serviceable psi of 50(?). Technician quoted a price of $745!! To replace a regulator that cost less than $100?!  There is an adjustment screw that reduces the psi and could have been done or at least recommended versus a $745 replacement. Extremely poor customer service after waiting for hours for technician to arrive. Not a pleased customer whatsoever. There motto of making you smile is not today rather the opposite.< /review>

Very prompt and courteous but the estimate was crazy high.  Paid $42 for estimate that could have been given over phone and saved us both time.  All we needed was a new toilet installed. The toilet  was already purchased and probably would have taken 30 minutes to install.  The estimate was over $700.00!!< /Text>

“I’m going to wow you with 5 star service”. Unfortunately that didn’t happen.  Didn’t even come close.  My plumber was having a bad day and instead of making the matters better he had excuses and didn’t want to do the job.  Was easily frustrated and definitely wish another person was called out.  I always use Bill Howe but in need of a plumber emergency we gave Anderson a call.  That was a mistake. They had a chance to “steal” my business from them and they did the opposite on that night.< /text>

Great service. Fernando and his helper were very professional. Quality and fast install of new water heater. They also installed a water regulator for the irrigation system.

I would have given 5 stars - except the price was very high in comparison. Especially that we plumbed the whole house with copper before. Anderson did the work ...<//text>

Enrique and crew installed my new heater and air conditioning system. A very, very professional installation. They were very professional and very attention to detail driven. This is the second major job I've had for Anderson, the first being my tankless water heater installation a year ago. This is my go-to group for any of the quality of life utilities that I need for my homes.</text>

Our technician, Dave, performed the annual inspection and servicing of our recently installed furnace. At the end, he provided a detailed report of the tests and measurements he performed. He took the extra time to answer all of my questions and even repaired a leak on the hot water vent on my roof. Just like all other Anderson employees, Dave left the area cleaner than he found it. I joined the Anderson VIP program and found it to be financially beneficial in keeping my furnace, hot water heater, and plumbing in good working order.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Repaired Shower Faucet.
I was led to believe it would be a more extensive job to replace a standard Moen valve (with a plastic handle)."Once I open up the wall it could take a while(paraphrasing)." Over $500 and 30minutes later he was out the door. Appalled, I dug a little deeper. Apparently, it's a very common valve and easy to fix, based on results. Of course, I called to complain several times and never received a callback. I did receive an email stating their policy and they would extend courtesy with a $126 discount. So the result is 1 valve $50 and 30 minute labor $324.  ***Buyer Beware<//Review>

Now I have to schedule another appointment to get the Sanitizing Service. It would of been a lot more convenient to get it done in one appointment. Last, the technicians used my garden hose and got it all muddy. It would of been nice if they could of swept the mud off the hose!< /review>< name>

Technician was very knowledgeable and honest, especially when technician before wasn’t accurate with diagnosis.  I was very pleased that I saved hundreds of dollars in what could have been a misdiagnosed situation.</Text>

While "Katy" was very professional in her demeanor and seems highly versed in the technical aspects of my furnace, I was surprised by the lack of specificity in the diagnoses. It could be this, this or this.  Which leads me to question, do service tech earn commission on repairs? In other words, the more parts and labor they sell, the bigger their paycheck?

Is this ethical?  Sadly, I ran into this same issue about a year or two ago with Anderson and my AC condenser. The repair estimate was $6K.  I ended up fixing it myself for $200 and it's worked perfectly ever since.

Today’s repair estimate  $1,788 + $68 for the service call. The parts, which I found online, are less than $285, and I question if they are both necessary. Labor time to replace these two suggested parts, or three suggested parts is 45 minutes for an experienced tech,  double for a novice.

With this second instance of what I believe are questionable at best business practices, and more likely unethical ones, obviously supported by management I will not use your company for any service or future sales.

UPDATE - March 2021
Apparently my review struck a nerve. Received a call and a full refund of my $68 service call fee. I still feel it’s a buyer beware situation, but I acknowledge the company did the right thing when they were called out.</text>

Donny replaced the supply valve to the toilet and some parts inside it as well. He worked quickly and did the work correctly. Donny listed all our options, and he communicated clearly and concisely. Before arriving, he sent us a photo-profile introducing himself so that we could tell that he is professional and friendly. Overall, we give him a rating of Excellent.</Text>

< Review>
Despite my reluctance to deal with a huge plumbing service, I requested a plumber from Anderson to come out and evaluate why my bathroom sink drain continues to clog only 1-2 months after having it cleaned out. I was clear when booking the appointment that I did not want an 'unclog' service but for an actual plumber to come assess my issue.

Afternoon appointments are supposed to be from 12-4pm but the technician did not arrive until 5pm. When she arrived I explained what I was looking to do, just as I had explained it to the dispatcher. I proceeded to show her the issue and she removed the drawers from my bathroom sink in order to look at the plumbing.

After looking at the plumbing she indicated that she could clear the clog but it would happen again due to the drain. I explained that the purpose of the service call was to evaluate and take the steps needed to permanently resolve the issue and I was happy to replace all plumbing if needed to resolve this issue.

She continued to recommend that I have her fix the issue so the drain flows for ~$150, and have someone else come look at the drain with a camera. When I explained that I didn't want to spend $150 on a temporary fix when I was going to pay to replace the plumbing, the technician gave me attitude and left without reinstalling the drawers into my sink cabinet.

It has been difficult to get ahold of anyone at Anderson to resolve the issue. I have requested my money back and will use a different plumber to complete my project.</Review>

<review>Replaced a smart thermostat from an older model. I provided thermostat. No extra wiring dine. Took tech about 10 minutes start to finish. Cost $291 and they did not connect to my router. Unable to use feature on smart thermostat. I guess i did get wowwed! Price versus what was actually done. I emailed Anderson Plumbing and i will wait to hear back. I wonder how much it would cost to have the thermostat to work as a smart device. WOW

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>We had Anderson come out and do a complimentary cleaning on our furnace. We were told we needed thousands of dollars in cleaning, repair, and upgrades to bring it up to code. We had a second opinion without mentioning any of the issues brought up by Anderson from another reputable company. They only quoted us one part to bring the unit up to code and it was a fraction of the price. We won’t be using Anderson again because of the prices and unnecessary services offered each time.</text>< Pictures>

They were able to come out in 12hrs for no rush charge, they called a half hour before arrival, sent me a text as well with a small bio on the technician in advance.  Extremely courtesy technician wore shoes covers and a mask the whole time but I had no problems understanding him as he spoke very clearly.  We had a pleasant chat as he worked and I learned that they will send the same technician out to the same house next time so you get to know them.  He seemed so happy with his job it was spoke well for the way they must treat their employees.  He took the time to look at another pipe I was told I needed to replace by a house inspector.  He went under the house and is having the office contact me to schedule an installer to come give me a quote.  But the whole appointment was quite fast!

Ben, the service tech came to do an annual tune up and inspection. He was right on time, very professional and did a careful and thorough job. Ben was very pleasant and polite and well groomed. Anderson PHA has done good work for us.<//review>

We discovered 2in. Of water on the garage floor. Called Anderson at night and the tech helped us shut everything down over the phone. Jamar came the next day, explained what needed to be done and got to work. I chose the sticker shock option because I knew it would be 100% trustable and quality. Thank you, Anderson and Jamar.< /Text>

My technician, Bryan Powers, serviced my hvac system  for its annual tune-up. Bryan was on time, professional, and knowledgeable about the job on hand. Mr. powers also recommended additional services to prolong the life of my heating/air system. I am very satisfied with selecting Anderson Pluming Heating & Air and will continue doing business with them in the future.

Wonderful from start to finish! The company called 30mins before to let me know when they would arrive! They also texted a picture of the man coming to fix my shower! When he arrived he had a clean mask on an put booties over his shoes as he walked into my house! He was good with my dogs. He did a very good inspection of my shower wall and found the leek behind the broken handle! He gave me options on fixing it with different prices so I could make the best decision!! Super professional and I will use them again!< /Review>

Replaced a leaking faucet outdoors and replaced my worn out bathtub and shower fixtures. Mike, from Anderson Plumbing did an excellent job. He inspected the problem, explained the repair (and why he chose that option), showed me the progress through the repair so I could see what was behind the walls, flushed the lines, ensured I was OK with the finished product, and cleaned up as if he were never there. I am very satisfied with Mike and the entire Anderson’s team from initial call to completion. I will use them for all my plumbing and HVAC needs. I would recommend Anderson’s Heating and Plumbing.<//text>

I required multiple services, and the technician was able to accomplish everything in one visit. 3 shutoff valves to be replaced, pressure regulator for the house, and install a new toilet. While the overall cost seemed a bit pricey, the quality of components and the overall service was excellent. I would use Anderson again, and recommend them to my friends< /Text>

I received a call from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air to advise me that I was due for my annual, no cost, service on my two heaters that Anderson had installed 4 years prior.  They indicated they had a technician that could perform the service the following day.

The HVAC Maintenance Technician, Haley Wegman, called the following day to say she'd be arriving within the half hour.  She was on time--we're off to a good start.

She inspected both of our heaters and provided an easy to follow assessment of what she'd found and done.  Haley was very professional, reassuring and a pleasure to work with.  Anderson has done an excellent job with recognizing the unique talents that military vets, like Haley, possess.  If I were to rate my satisfaction with Anderson and Haley on a 10 point scale, they would receive an 11.<//text>

Micheal was very nice and checked all areas for a leak. He didn’t locate the leak in my toilet and referred me to advanced detection who found the toilet valve was leaking. I think Anderson should have found and repaired the leak before I had to pay $240 to have the tank cover lifted to reveal the slow leak. Now I have to pay for another visit by Anderson to make the repairs. This is an expensive mistake by Anderson<//Text>

We are so appreciative of Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air! We had a leak within our wall/ceiling. I called and Mike arrived within the hour. Our plumbing issue was complicated and it took Mike two full days to fix it, but he was dogged his problem-solving. When you're in this type of situation, it's a little overwhelming and it was a relief to have engaged with such a responsive, reliable, professional company.</Review>

His knowledge on the subject and safety advice is very much appreciated! Unfortunately I cannot resolve the issue as quickly as I’d like the information he gave me will ensure I make the right choice when the time comes!

<Review>As part of Anderson’s comprehensive home maintenance program, I was delighted to have them call and schedule a checkup of my water heater. This is part of their service after the sale that helps to set Anderson apart from the others.
The technician came by on schedule and Preventively serviced my water Heater and explained how to help it last as long as possible.  Offered No pressure to make any Upgrades but gave me options to consider if we wanted to improve our water quality.
I think I made an excellent decision to go with Anderson when we installed our AC system. I’m confident they will take care of us for years to come.< /Review></record>

I Just wanted to let you know that the service technician you sent,  Michael Gaskill, did an excellent job for me on my A/C system. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable and diagnosed and got the deferred maintenance and repairs accomplished all in one appointment. He even spotted and corrected some prior installation defects from the original installer and cleaned my permanent air filter in the unit for me! I would not hesitate to have Michael perform heating and cooling repairs for me at my home in the future.

<review>We have had Jose come out to our house twice and he is really friendly, professional, and informative. I love that Anderson Plumbing is do prompt and reasonably priced, and they give a 90 day warranty on clogs, they also will send a camera down your drain for free. I've dealt with other companies that charge $100 for that. I won't use anymore else.<//review>< user_name>

I wish I could give Jacob and Humberto 10 stars instead of five!  I had a gigantic hot water leak in the slab of my home and called Anderson Plumbing to check it out.  After hearing a wide range of repair options and learning about the benefits of repiping the water system through the attic (no future slab leaks and no tearing up the floor!), I decide to go for the whole home repipe.  Jacob and Humberto started work the next morning and completed the pipe fitting within three days.  I was blown away by the quality, speed, accuracy and cleanliness of their work.  They communicated well with me, each other, and their main office so there were zero hiccups.  A huge bonus was that we had running, cold water and at least one restroom available at all times, until the last three hours when the system changed from old pipes to new.  A VERY well ran project and professional company from start to finish!  Please don’t hesitate to call Anderson...or have your home repiped by them!<//review>

I had a water leak emergency in my house, and I am so grateful that Anderson Plumbing was able to fit me in, and very quickly, too.  The first two plumbing companies I called said they were booked solid, and wouldn't even try to help.  Anderson did a fast, courteous job and even gave me the senior discount!  What a lifesaver they were!<//Review>

< Review>
Anderson Plumbing helped us with a last minute issue. In having our floors replaced we needed a plumber to check for leaks as our concrete subfloors had some moisture on them. We got very quick appointment with Anderson Plumbing and Joshua showed up the next morning, early and checked everything for us thoroughly. It was quite a relief to have someone come out with such short notice and still be very thorough and not cut any corners! Thank you guys so much!<//Review>

First time customer and will use again.  Always saw their commercials and received flyer on specials (yes, they work).  Had a leak in kitchen clean out and James came out same day.  He explained the problem, gave me options and then proceeded to work.  About 20 mins later work was done and price was reasonable.  Wonder why I waited so long?  Next time will call them first!</Review>

I can’t speak so much about the company as I’d like to comment on how amazing our technician Josue was. If we could give six stars we would, Andersen is fortunate to have someone like this on their team.<//Text></record>

Update:
Erin, Anderson's Client Relations Manager reached out via email and explained their policy of flat rate per type of the job.  She offered 15% off on the water pressure regulator job and removed the charge for accessing the valve. While I recognize the effort to provide good customer care (along with multiple text, email and phone call asking for feedback)  I cannot say I'm remotely happy about this flat rate charge that's 3-4 time higher than being reasonable.

===========================================================
Anderson Plumbing's charge is absurdly high! I had a technician come to fix a leaky waterline going into the fridge. while doing that he also found the water pressure was high and I agreed to have the water pressure regulator replaced.

He had to cut a small hole on the drywall to access the pipe, which took him 30 seconds, and the charge is $323. Note this is only for cutting the hole, not including any repair work, and they will not fix the drywall afterwards. The actual repair work of replacing the water supply line's connection valve is another $323, which I'm ok with, since at least the technician spent 30 minutes on it.

The most ridiculous one is the $1,485 charge for replacing the water pressure regulator. The part is $180 according to the technician, and it's a quick job taking him literally less than 10 minutes using only a plumbers plier. I found out afterwards a reasonable cost for this should be in the $300 range including the part, and feel quite bad not doing enough research and being an informed customer beforehand. I wish everyone else considering calling them have the chance to read the reviews beforehand and be aware of their practice of overcharging to an outrageous extent.

I do agree that it was easy for me to make the appointment, and the technician came on time and finished the job quickly in a professional manner. But I'd not be able to recommend their services to anyone due to the extremely unreasonably high cost.<//review>

Both technicians Ismael and Peter were very professional on time very informative very courteous and very knowledgeable of the job I would highly recommend both of them and I had a choice between three plumbing and heating companies and I thought I had already made my first choice but after I met with Debbie who also was very informative and professional.i was so impressed i decided to go with Anderson heating and plumbing to install a New Heater and A/C unit.  It was the BEST CHOICE!!</review>

<Text>I called on a Friday night after we showed our condo all day and came home to find the thermostat off and not responding to the usual reset circuit breaker, etc. Joselito was out to our house quickly and had the electrical issue fixed in less than an hour. The cost was very reasonable and the service was excellent.< /Text>< resp>

I was really wowed , Ken was so kind, helpful, professional, informative. Knowledgeable and went above and beyond to fix and repair,
He repaired a shower diverter that the original contractor i hired messed up. He was so respectful and didn't wanna step in the shower to keep it clean
Then I asked to replace a kitchen faucet so he took care of it although he had to cut the rusty part and also fixed all the plumbing mistakes originally was made by some bad plumer, that  eventually ended in my dishwasher working again after I was about to buy a new one.
I can't say enough about Ken, he cared about my house like its his</text>

I called to avail their promotion for mini split tune up. Joe was the technician who came to perform the job. He did a thorough inspection of my unit to make sure my filters are clean, the coils are producing much needed cold air, pressure is ok. Keep up the excellent job Joe. He is also very respectful and friendly.<//Text>

Aug 28  rPlumber was great, gave estimate $300+ to pull toilet. Did the work and found a broken flange which he didn't have.Would reschedule for Sat 29..... Sat 29 someone  calls in sick, will schedule Monday fine with us. ...Mon 31 a tech arrives but says he is her to do a complementary  camera inspection of our system.Never said specifically he was their to finish the job....estimate now $660+. We send him off they will reschedule us now for tues Sept 1 Agent for Andersen call us on the phone agent is finally on the way estimate ..$1,500 to finish seating our toilet had her repeat it so my wife could hear $1,500! My wife is handicapped with Parkinsons so the toilet is essential .So after 5days after pulling the toilet and the estimate doubling every time. We definitely felt we were getting burned.The job is not done  we are going elsewhere!<//Text>

We had an old water heater that started leaking.  Anderson was able to come first thing the next day to give a free estimate.  We had several companies come out and provide us quotes to replace it with a gas tankless water heater.   Anderson came in at a reasonable price but the technician, Drew (Andrew), included additional incentives that persuaded us to go with them.  Drew had everything with him and was able to get us the appropriate water heater that same day.  He relocated and installed the water heater outside of our garage by the end of the day.   We were impressed by how efficient and clean he was with his work.  We had previous copper plumbing done in our home before and Drew was impressively quicker than the other guys.  He had to come back another day to finish up other work to our house but was equally as efficient and clean with his work.  He also set us up to have our drains scoped for free.  The technician, Brent, came out to scope our drains and was equally efficient, timely, and customer friendly.  I would highly recommend Anderson, Drew, and Brent for future plumbing/heating projects.<//review>

Worst ever customer service and plumbing knowledge. We called them for detecting a leak which had resulted in the floor flooding. The plumber came visited the house and charged us for the visit. The plumber had no clue, he could not detect the source and wrongly advised that the leak was coming from the bathroom upstairs. They charged us $365 for nothing and never send us a report. After multiple follow ups still till date no report has been given. We ended up calling another plumber who very quickly detected the leaking dishwasher at almost $100 cheaper. He also help fixed the leak and helped us with drying company and dishwasher company.

I would never use Andersen Plumbing ever again and advise everyone to stay away from them.

Subsequent to this review I had a very good follow up from Andersen and they have since rectified their response and have successfully resolved the matter to my satisfaction.

Thank you Andersen for prompt followup.</text>

Used To service my heater. Tech seemed very knowledgeable and walked me through his process. At the end there was a pitch for a service maintenance contract and a $12K replacement of my entire HVAC system. Both of which as asked for them to send as a quote and didn’t want to commit upfront.

The tech had booties but walked to and from his truck with them on so not sure they helped much. My wife needed to ask the tech to put on a new mask since his wasn’t covering his alface completely- he was nice enough to comply.

Overall positive experience with a few minor bumps.<//Text>

Terrible.  Had a guy out on July 6 to look at our shower faucet/fixture for repair.  He disassembled and took the parts to try and find new ones, saying he would be in touch in a couple of days.  Crickets.

We called 3 times and were told the technician would get back with us soon.  More crickets.

Called again and were told that technician had a "family emergency" and would be in touch when he returned.  More crickets.

Called today, July 31, and was told the technician quit.  He still has our fixture, which I can not now repair as they are an uncommon brand and hard to find.  We have not been able to use the bathroom shower/tub for almost a month.  The manager is "going to look into it" and was supposed to call me today or tomorrow.

Unbelievably unprofessional for the "nobody wows clients like we do" company.</text>

<text>I've never used Anderson Plumbing until yesterday. My technician Josh was a plumbing maestro. I had a hard to find leak in an older home and he was able to determine exactly where it was and how to fix it in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately, he had to use a jackhammer but I feel very confident his work was done expertly and I will not have any more issues. Moreover, he was professional, present and respectful.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1589491257934, 'text': "Thank you Mr. Forgione!\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity to serve you and thank you for posting your review.\n\nIt's wonderful to know that you are so pleased with Josh's service and professionalism.\n\nServing San Diego for over 40 years has taught us that customers want efficiency and peace of mind.

Had a leak on my hot water valve under my bathroom sink. The valves were super old and I tried to close the valve which caused the issue. Andrew with Anderson Plumbing showed up within 20 minutes. He replaced both hot and cold valves and was out the door within another 20 minutes. He was very professional through the entire process. I will definitely be calling him back for any more plumbing needs.</Text>

I was quoted to replace a 40 gallon water heater at 3990. Of course this must have included a waterless system which I wasn't given both options. My wife had to meet them being I got held up and I'm starting to think maybe a little hoodwink was in place when wifey opened the door cause do the math. 40 gallon brand-new water heater is no more than 600 home depot, search online and find an installer for 200 to 250 tops, now we at 850 and this is a high 850, it could be at least minus 200 from that depending on thriftiness in ones blood. However, of course the water damage was way to extensive for Anderson plumbing so they needed another company one they suggested to come dry out sheet rock in the garage, hehehe. Not sheetrock in the breathing area within the home but off in the garage that was hardly bad, my house fan could dry it up in 5 hours . However, to get all done we were looking at 4000 to 5000. Oh us military have a whopping 3 percent discount , ooohhhh. Just keep that 3 percent and invest into a little moral dignity and remember what it was like when you started out Mrs Andersen, not everyone has la jolla strip mall money, and to be women owned part of a special population you would think they wouldn't try to get over on a wife filling in for husband or 3 percent might actually go to 10 percent for another special population in military and that 5000 is 2 military paychecks just to get water hot, hell I could rent two recruits from mcrd to sit and blow their hot breath on the tank and it be more morally inline than 5000 dollars for 40 gallons of water but wait they were trying to upgrade our whole system cause they must have insider scoop my housing area is turning into a strip mall where 5000 seems bout right when it also has a 24hr fitness inside the mall, ridiculous, .I just paid 75 for a water heater and 250 to install from facebook marketplace, Anderson you ought to be ashamed of the robbery you just attempted .

Have used them before on a clogged sink drain, this time it was the toilet. They give you plenty of time to be ready before a technician arrives. My technician Chris made quick work of the issue and was very professional the entire visit. I will choose Anderson again any time when faced with plumbing related issues.< /review>

Anderson plumbing heating & Air - came to service my AC - but arrived without a new filter
They installed the entire furnace and AC unit -
In Covid times - it would be nice to be prepared with essential items to avoid entering homes unnecessarily- now they’ll need to come back
Again - Just a waste of their time & mine
The filter was in serious need of replacement..<//review>

The slogan ‘How can we make your day a little better’ is exactly what u receive.
My heater was wintered checked at no charge, & the service rep Jeff was true to the 5 star service the company represents. Jeff was courteous, friendly, an expert in his field & walked me through the services he was providing, explaining all facets. As a senior citizen I truly appreciated his time & patience with any questions I had.
Thank you Anderson Plumbing, your techs r the best!!!</Text>

We have had our heater and AC, as well as our water heater, serviced by Anderson for about 15 years now.  Appointments are easy to make and the technicians are professional as well as congenial.  Aldo just serviced our AC.  We bought it from Anderson one year ago.  Aldo was very tolerant of our questions throughout his visit.  He also suggested items to enhance the performance of our AC.  He knew his stuff!< /Review>

< review>
I had Anderson plumbing company did repiping for the drainage pipes of my whole house 3 weeks ago, I’m very satisfied with their work, charges are reasonable, and glad I picked up the right company to do the jobs for me.
Bernard, Eugene, and Morgan are talented plumbers, knowledgeable, trustworthy, and efficient.  They are very fair in what needs to be fixed, promptly diagnosed the problems with a great at explaining exactly what needs to be done as they proceeded.  Everything was well done by the team and no dirt was left behind.  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the company to my families and friends< /review>

< Review>
Anderson is overpriced manipulated company.  The technician opened up my sealed ac unit even though I specifically said my AC is fine.  I was fortunated done a lot homework and went with airmaxx.  They were abel to fix my AC blower fan capacitor via Anderson pushed me into replace my whole heating system for $6300+.  Please stay away from them.

Just to update.  My AC was ended fixed for $237.  One honest mechanics replaced capacitor and that's it.  Anderson teared my AC and heater all apart.  It would cost even less.<//Review>

They sent workers out right away. Very impressed with their knowledge & “yes” to getting my pipes fixed same day. They also referred an excellent contractor for drying spaces & repairing drywall damage(Apex). A final call to see if I was satisfied was a plus in customer satisfaction. I would definitely call them first.</review>

<Review>Aldo Lopez, HVAC tech from Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air came to do a routine check-up/maintenance on our Air Conditioning unit today. Aldo was polite, wore protective gear and practiced good social distancing. He fine tuned our unit, topped off the refrigerant and changed the filter and anything else that was needed. Even though it was raining and muddy, he didn't make a mess. He did give me a couple of recommendations for the future life of our A/C. I would like to have Aldo perform any future HVAC repairs.

We have been using Anderson Plumbing, Heat and Air fir several years, and have never been disappointed.</Review><name>Bill Marshall< /name><Date>1586567979469< /Date><gmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We were contacted by Anderson to let us know that our technician would be arriving shortly.  Johnny was on time. He listened to our concerns and answered our questions thoroughly.  He showed us a feature of our system that would have it run more efficiently and would save money on the power bill.
Johnny conducted our servicing quickly and shared the results with us.
He was friendly, knowledgeable, and professional.  He is a great ambassador for the company.<//Review>

The men, Jason, Mario, Peter and electrician, Christian were hard working, respectful group of workers!  Jason was an excellent supervisor. They cleaned up and left my house better than when they came.
I couldn't have asked for a less stressful  project in my home.  JOB WELL DONE!!

I recommend that you look for "Specials" on their website to save a few $$.

Michael, the technician came in and was so friendly. Knowledgeable on what he is doing and very professional, he explained to me what was going on with my furnace. He recommended things that I should do to keep my furnace, air conditioning, and plumbing up and working.

The only thing that I wish was lower was the price of the parts and service that was changed and charged. But other than that, the service was excellent.</Review>

Our plumber, Syn, provided the best possible service. We have not experienced a better plumbing service. He was very thorough in explaining the whole process and was down to earth and easy to talk to. He worked to give us the best price possible and was extremely friendly. He seemed to really enjoy working for Anderson Plumbing and spoke very highly of them. I can’t think you enough, Syn and Anderson Plumbing... you made this experience so easy and you have earned a life long customer (as needed of course!)<//text>

I am super satisfied with my drain clearing service with Anderson plumbing. I liked that they call before heading over, and the plumber that came answered all the questions I had. He also cleared my drain very quickly and told me about what he found in there. I am happy I was able to use a $53 coupon for the service, and I will call them again if I need a plumber. Would recommend.</text>

<Review>So I am usually not one to write reviews …. but I just had a great experience with Anderson and their pro plumber Ron Miller so here I go.
On the road while my wife deals with a plumbing fiasco long brewing under the sink.  I get home and dial for help.  They said most likely a night call, I was fine with that.  One day turnaround great by me.   Instead, they call back in an hour or so and someone is free now … yea!  Plumber Ron Miller is highly recommended by me.  He is our plumber now..  A pro , not a kid (sorry kids) he has experience and fixed us up, plus another issue I surprised him with.  No problem.   Thanks Anderson and especially Ron!  Highest recommendation from a tough old guy who can't fix anything by himself!</Review><user>115388868370601076614< /user><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1527893139664<//time>< Gmap_id>

<Name>Krishna Jagannathan<//Name><Time>1540607283995</Time><rating>5</rating><Text>I had issues with my heating, plumbing and air conditioning all on the same day. The representative that answered the phone when I called made sure I had an immediate appointment the next day and I was kept apprised of when the technician(s) would be arriving and also whether there was an earlier slot available so that I wouldn't have to wait.

All 3 of the technicians arrived on time and made me feel comfortable that they would resolve the problem.

Donald and Reggie, who handled the plumbing did a wonderful job! They explained everything to me and had me watch as they were doing the work. I have additional work to be done and they gave me options so that I could choose the most cost effective solution for my home and made an appointment to finish the work as soon as possible. Both were very competent, professional and personable and managed to resolve my issue, which gave me peace of mind.

The same was true for Mike, who handled my heating and air conditioning issues. He took the time to thoroughly diagnose and troubleshoot the problems and to make sure I was satisfied with his work before I left. I felt the pricing was reasonable given the fact that the work was warrantied by the company directly and none of them tried to pressure me into choosing a more expensive option. Reggie explained the rationale behind why it would be better to spend a little extra when it came to replacing two of the faucets in my bathroom.

All 3 left their contact info with me so I could reach them if there were any further problems and assured me that the company warranted their  work. They all also talked to me about the company's current promotions but didn't push me into going for any of them.

I had a very positive experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air and I would definitely work with this company again!</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1541613199278, 'text': 'Thank you Krishna for your 5 star review, and compliments on Reggie, Donny & Mike!

Johnny Castro made a courtesy call to fix wiring that was left exposed by an electrician from another company. He did a great job of addressing that and making an eyesore look professionally covered. He upgraded the batteries in the outside unit for the wireless thermostat, and did a thorough visual inspection of the furnace in our attic. Lastly, he gave me a quick overview of how our new wireless thermostat works. This is the third time he has been here, and he is always professional, courteous, & taking the time to listen & explain things. He is an excellent representative of Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air!

< review>
Amazing service, our technician Andy was the best most respectful person we’ve had in our home. The other company who was at our house yesterday was out for a buck, but Andy took time to explain what was going on, was conservative with a treatment plan and went above and beyond what was required of him. As a small business owner, I understand the power of a good experience, and I will be telling EVERY SINGLE PERSON, business owner, friend and acquaintance about how wonderful of a company Anderson is. I am truly blown away by the service. Andy needs a raise, bonus and vacation. He is a gem you have working for you. A true gentleman and an honest tradesperson—qualities that are as rare as a diamond.<//review>

I just wanted to leave a review of the billing practices of Anderson Plumbing & Heating, that is the only portion of their work I find to be sub par.  We called them for a leaking toilet in a rental, they showed up at the appointed time and gave us the options of repairing or replacing.  We chose to replace and the work was completed on time and with what appears to be high quality.  My only complaint, the bill.  Parts and labor for an entirely new toilet was $518.98, reasonable.  The total bill was $1179, overhead & profit $660.02, which I think is too high.  They were contacted regarding the bill and they would not offer to cut any of the profit or overhead.<//Review>

The two young men who came to work on my drains were very professional and did a quick job while still fixing the issues. James, who was so knowledgeable explained everything he did and what would need to be done in the future. I'm pleased to recommend Anderson's and to keep them as my family provider< /review>

The plumber was on time and completed our mainline drain cleaning in a timely manner. He was very pleasant and provided tips on how to avoid clogs in the future. It was our first time using Anderson and will recommend them to family and friends.</Text>

<review>Plumbing problems are never good, but weekends seem to be when they happen to us.  We were concerned that we might have had to wait for hours for someone to come, but that wasn't the case.

James arrived in less than an hour after we called Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  He listened carefully when we described our situation, and promptly diagnosed the problem.  He got to work and in no time at all cleared the drain and everything was back to normal.

James took care to make sure no dirty water spilled anywhere and he described everything he was doing and why.  It was like getting a mini-plumbing lesson as a bonus.  He cares about his work and it shows.  He is simply the best.

We can't recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air enough.  When we had air conditioning work done previously, we joined their VIP program which we also recommend.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I began my search for a plumber to fix a blockage somewhere in the line by looking for a small, family-owned business to do the job.  I previously had a bad experience with a large company and didn't want to repeat that experience.  Although I found many wonderful plumbers to chose from at reasonable rates, everyone was busy and I was getting impatient.
My mom told me she used Anderson a few times with great results so I gave them a call.  Amazing service!  James was at my door within an hour or two, was polite, skilled and seemed to genuinely enjoy his work.  He spoke highly of his company and represented Anderson well.  Mine was not an easy job.  It required much troubleshooting and James was able to see it through with success!  With an online special they were running, I received and absolutely extraordinary deal.  Also received a nice warranty for the work.  I can't tell you how grateful I am.  Icing on the giant cake-Anderson donates a portion of proceeds to Susan G. Komen for breast cancer research on Fridays!  I am wowed! :)<//Review>< pics>

<time>1498606143468<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Brian Blanchard and Justin B spent a very HOT, busy week rerouting our pipes through our attic due to a hot water leak in the cement slab in our La Mesa home. They were role models for what you WISH your plumber could be. They were very professional and involved US in the decision making needed to resolve our problems.  They treated us and our house with respect and consideration. EVERY evening they cleaned up the areas where they had worked diligently all day.  I cannot IMAGINE what the temperature was in our skinny attic!  They didn't just cut off at a respectable closing time, they worked well into the evening hours. They each have an incredible work ethic and take pride in a job well done.  They arrived on schedule and were personally neat and clean.  It is too bad you can't clone these men, because they treated us and our plumbing issues the way YOU would like to be treated.
Thank you for having the good sense to hire these two fine gentlemen.
Sincerely,
Dick and Sally Sweet<//Text>< pics>

I am very pleased to recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air. Everyone I have dealt with has been exceptional. The staff is very professional, efficient and friendly.  My first experience was with Justin who came to service my disposal. He did an excellent job and I was confident when I later scheduled to have him replace my water heater. Justin is very skilled and knowledgeable. He has a friendly manner and is able to explain all options and answer all questions thoroughly. Justin helped me to obtain the best deal and to use the credit I received from a previous service. When my water heater was installed Justin was assisted by Bethany who was also very professional and knowledgeable. I asked Bethany lots of questions, some of which I thought might be silly, but she patiently and knowledgeably answered each one. I felt very confident in her skills especially as I watched her performing her work. Both Justin and Bethany worked to make sure everything was done perfectly. I was very impressed with the quality of their work. I am very happy with my new disposal and water heater. I can relax knowing they were installed by technicians with exceptional skills using quality products. Thank you Justin and Bethany!<//text>

Eric Weismann at Anderson Plumbing is amazing!! My entire experience with Anderson Plumbing was perfect and their office staff is right on par with the way customer service is supposed to be. This is probably the only company I have experienced in San Diego who makes the customers concerns an actual priority. Before I contacted Anderson plumbing I had spent 3 weeks working with my home warranty to get someone out to look for a hard to find water leak. That company spent 2 days trying to find it and were very unprofessional. I kicked them out and called Anderson Plumbing. Within 3 hours of calling they had a technician (Eric) at my house! An hour later, Eric was able to tell me exactly where the leak was (under the slab in the garage) and walked me through the house to show me the route of all my water pipes. Eric with Anderson gave me a quote that was roughly $2000 less than the company my home warranty provided. That other Company ended up being off on the location of the leak by about 30 feet and wanted to jack hammer the slab in my bathroom. Thank God for Eric and Anderson Plumbing and their quality leak detection equipment and skill. If you want it done right you had better call Anderson Plumbing!<//text>

They took care of a 25 year old HVAC unit to make it last for another 5 years which I had Anderson replace a few months ago when the old unit finally went out.  This past weekend I had my "VIP" plumbing inspection which was very detailed.  Dylan, my technician, was very thorough checking all of my plumbing including the hot water heater, water pressure valve and explained things as he went along.  A couple of days prior to my inspection my garbage disposal went out.  Dylan, reminded me that Anderson could do the work while he was there.  He took the time and had the new disposal readily available to install. Every technician I have had over the past 5 years are highly trained, qualified and professional.  Their office personnel is as well.  It is nice to have follow up after a service is performed and they do just that to make sure the customer is always satisfied.

Called on 9-5-19 spoke to Tasha and she told me that there is a open window after 12pm but no guarantee. On 9-6-19 I told them I will be home after 330pm. Got home at 4pm and called and spoke with multiple people and every hour and was told I was next. Finally after 4+hrs I got a call and girl who called said that I was not on her list.

I called approximately 6 times and each I was told you will be next you will be next you're next in que the technician is on the way. We really felt let down again.

I stand by what I said above based on what we went through. But I am man enough to say that my man Johnny saved the night. This dude is top notch and really knows his "S"...super cool like the other side of the pillow👊. I wouldn't mine him lending his expertise in the near future. And too the dispatch supervisor thank you for your concern.</text>

Eric A., Sal V., and Johnny C. were top notch.  Very professional and courteous.
They are great representatives for their company.  I was particularly impressed how air conditioning installers Sal and Johnny were very careful in their work like covering our carpeting and protecting the work area.  Their attitude was positive and upbeat.  I would recommend Anderson to anyone because of my experience with Eric, Sal, and Johnny.</review>

Anderson Plumbing has been our go to company for 4 years now since we bought our home.  They have helped us replace a broken AC unit, cleared our drains multiple times, replaced old fixtures, etc.  They will soon be doing a complete sewer pipe repair/replacement.  We are going with them for this major service because they have earned our trust with their honest and informative crew.  I have never, ever felt pressured to agree to a service I didn't want.  Every single crew member has been polite, respectful and considerate to me and my family.  Their office staff are great too!  You can't go wrong with using Anderson Plumbing!< /Text>

Johnny c.. is the best technician I have ever had on my heater and A/C. He is very knowledgeable and explains everything in detail. Takes the time to answer all questions completely and honestly. He worked on my A/C and furnace and treated it like it was own.  Every time I get service I'm going to request John.  He is true professional from his work ethic to appearance. I also had Anderson plumbing do my water heater replacement and no difference.  This company is the best.< /Text>

Our technician Dylan was very knowledgeable and efficient. He got to work right away and got the job done. He gave us a detailed assessment at the end and answered our questions fully. The final bill was what I was quoted and what I felt was fair for the work. He added additional value by presenting us with coupons for discounts on Anderson services and recommended further work. I am completely satisfied and would happily recommend Dylan and Anderson.<//Text>

I have had two remarkably excellent experiences with Anderson Plumbing. Both were large jobs requiring experience, knowledge, and skill to perform. I can report that both jobs were performed with professionalism and at a reasonable price. I am quite satisfied and recommend Anderson to anyone needing small or large plumbing problems resolved.

I was out of town and my pet sitter let me know that the AC was out. I called Anderson plumbing and Heating and they were able to set up a service call the day I arrived home. With it being so hot I didn't think they would be able to come the day after I called. I was grateful that they were able to come service my unit and get us back up and running with cool air immediately.< /Text>

Anderson had Michael come up quite soon after we called, sent a notice of his arrival with his picture (a great safety technique), and his work was clearly professional.  He knew what he was doing, was clear about the issues found, and well informed as to our options.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Erik went above and beyond what he was called out for. Couldn't have had a more informed representative from Anderson. Appreciated his honesty, his patient explanations and sound advice. Very friendly and respectful. He checked all around the house, tested water pressure, checked the water heater, and even crawled into our crawlspace to make sure we didn't have any leaks. He recommended a new water heater rather than flushing out the existing. (We have not flushed it in a very long time and the valve is plastic and the risk of cracking wasn't worth it.) Our tank is quite old and it's time to get a new one. I trust his recommendation! Thanks, Erik, and thanks again, Anderson Plumbing, for taking care of us as VIP members!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Live in a condo & had a leak inside the kitchen wall. The leak damaged the ceiling downstairs. Called Anderson Plumbing, technician James Padgett, and he is so professional. Compared to other plumbers, his knowledge & people skills are excellent. He opened the wall, diagnosed the problem, offered options & estimates, then proceeded to repair everything that needed repaired. The quality of the work is first class & no debris was left behind. I'd rate the service 10 out of 10. Then he came back to install a pressure regulator. Again, extremely friendly & professional. The quality of the work was awesome. I really like my experience with this company, will advocate for them, & will use them again in the future.

<text>My plumbers were very meticulous and thorough. They had clear explanations of the problem and steps to fix them.  I was especially pleased with their attention to detail regarding cleanliness. Even though our house is not the cleanest in the world, they still took time to put their booties on every time they came in the house in order to prevent tracking dirt. I really appreciated that detail.</text>< Pics>

<text>George, my technician, provided outstanding service during the service call on 12/6/17.  He was prompt and courteous.  He was neat, clean and his uniform presented the company well.  He was proficient at his job, ensured to maintain cleanliness at the work site, and took care to protect my floors and home from any damage.  He thoroughly explained what the problem was and the repairs he was making.  He offered good tips on dealing with the water issues in San Diego.  He thoroughly deserves the 5-star rating.  Thanks George.<//text>< pics>

Explained everything to us. Gave us options. Everything in writing! Super courteous and experienced. Quiet. Cleaned up after themselves every day. Never treate our home as a construction site!
Thorough. Respectful. Supervisor came out just to see how things were progressing! How many companies do that??
Would we use them again? You bet.Would we recommend them? Absolutely. Will you be glad you chose them? You will probably never use anyone else. They spoil you.</Text>

< review>
They made a very messy plumbing issue a no problem issue. The guys that came over were professional and a enjoyment to spent several long days with. I was quoted a price on the first day and that’s the price I paid on the last day, there was no added expense. From what two of my friends told me I got a fair price for the mess and I mean mess that had to be fixed. I would use them again and tell my friends to call them if they needed a plumber fast.< /review>

< Review>
Rudy performed our annual VIP plumbing inspection.  He inspected all of the toilets and sinks in our home.  In addition, he drained our two water heaters.  We also requested him to clear a bathroom sink drain, repair a kitchen faucet and re-pipe a drain in our laundry room.   From the time Rudy arrived, he immediately went to work and completed a thorough inspection.  It was a difficult task to clear the bathroom sink.  It required full disassembly and replacement of parts.  He diagnosed the back-up problem in our laundry room and was able to resolve the drainage issue.
It took three hours to complete all of this work.  We are very appreciative of Rudy's high quality work and commitment to fixing each problem correctly.<//Review>

Ms. Katy,

Katy was the best technician I have ever had work on my AC unit.  She found the back wiring connection and had the unit back up and running after troubleshooting the problem of freezing up.  She came after 7:00PM the very same day I called and was working when most people were off and home with their families.

I appreciate her for her effort.

First if of , I appreciated the fact that the technician came early in the day, and not 30 minutes prior to the end of the "morning" time frame. I've lost hours of personal leave from work due to the service provider's inconsiderate scheduling tactics.
The technician, Johnny Castro, was prompt, professional, and knowledgeable! But most of all she displayed sincere empathy to my situation.<//review>

<Time>1538664623815< /Time><rating>3<//rating><review>This has been a long drawn out process. We had 4 quotes for our new air conditioning. Although Anderson did not come in the least expensive we liked the professionalism and warranty. But things went downhill from there. Communication was horrible. We were to have our install Monday morning and I had to call Friday just before 5 to find out when they were coming. Upon install they could not get the wireless thermostat to install and said they were going to send someone back out to connect it. I again had to call 4 days later to find out when someone was coming to fix or replace it. He could not fix it- and had to come back again with a new unit. Sooooo we thought everything was great and  then we got a call that they installed the incorrect (Lower power) unit. So we had to schedule another install date. Again no one called to let us know when they were coming out- a “discount check” was promised to be mailed or brought with the technician and of course it wasn’t so they had to send a runner with the check. Bottom line we are super happy with the product and all of the people that come to our home. But the people in the office lack all sorts of professionalism.< /review>< pics>

Because of his expertise, we tried to actually find more work for him to fix to get his opinion on other issues, besides my initial dishwasher drainage problem.

I am very grateful for his work , and he actually saved me a lot of time.</text>

I can't say enough about how wonderful this company is!  We had been calling at least 15 places to deal with our issue.  They came same day, were reasonably priced and Ken was magnificent!  Courteous, professional, knowledgeable and one of the greatest service people we have ever dealt with!  In this day and age, this type of service is exceptional rare!  Much appreciated and would definitely recommend and use again in the future!!<//review>

I thought the drain from the toilet to the main line was blocked but he ran a few tests and determined the blockage was actually in the low-flow toilet itself. The problem was that the flush handle was not being held down long enough with the result that  the bowl was getting insufficient water so  toilet paper was not being pushed through the trap (located in the toilet) to the sewer pipe. On these low flow toilets you can't just press and release the handle- if you do the flapper valve will close prematurely. You must press and hold the handle down to keep the flapper valve open until all the water in the tank has entered the bowel.< /Text><Time>1537325674206</Time><user_name>James Christensen</user_name>< Rate>

<Review>Justin replaced our water heater.  His work ethic was remarkable, and he worked straight through without a break until the job was done.  He was extremely pleasant and enjoyable to talk with.  His work was thoroughly professional and careful, and the finished installation looks perfect. I would be happy to have him perform any plumbing job in my home.</Review>< pics>

<review>Eric T. was very professional and thorough.  Went right to work and fixed the problem for us.  this has been a recurring issue so lets hope it stays fixed.  When Eric left, everything was working fine.  No problems.  Easy to work with and very neat and orderly.  Communicated well as to what he was doing and what he was thinking.  If we need to call again, send Eric.<//review><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015< /GmapID>< date>

Justin did a great job fixing the broken water heater and also dealing with the high water pressure issue. He was patient with our landlord and took the time to fix the much needed repairs. Glad to have everything up to date and Anderson was able to respond to our issue so quickly and effectively.<//Review>

<Review>I am Wowed once again!  We have been using Anderson Heating and Plumbing for several years, not only for our own home, but also our rentals.  The technicians are always courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient. Years ago we went through several plumbers, that on the face of it were cheaper, but they took much long and often did not do the job correctly.  You get what you pay for.  This is a top notch firm, that often prices out much better because they know what they are doing and have the supplies with them. Thank you!  Kuddos to James who found the problem today, and fixed it in no time!!!!<//Review>< Pics>

We called Anderson because our water filter system was leaking,  we thought it was the seal.  Ken found out it was our water pressure regulator and even he didn't have the part, he went back to his warehouse to get one and come back within 30 minutes to complete the work for us.  We don't have to wait another day or have to make another appointment.  He checked our water heater regulator timer and showed me how to set it as well.  He provides us an exceptional service.<//Review>

They used to be fast and efficient.  but this weekend they lost a customer.  Friday night, with 12 guests at the house, my Mom's drain backed up while washing dishes..One they had worked on in September.  As  VIP customer, we were told the earliest appointment was Thursday, 5 days away!  Needless to say we called another company and got someone out the next morning.<//text>

I am Wowed once again!  We have been using Anderson Heating and Plumbing for several years, not only for our own home, but also our rentals.  The technicians are always courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient. Years ago we went through several plumbers, that on the face of it were cheaper, but they took much long and often did not do the job correctly.  You get what you pay for.  This is a top notch firm, that often prices out much better because they know what they are doing and have the supplies with them. Thank you!  Kuddos to James who found the problem today, and fixed it in no time!!!!<//Text>

Thankfully my husband had already removed the toilet from the floor to access the sewer line, bit clog was too deep for him to get to, but if if he had not removed toilet and then replaced it after Jason left, then gets much more expensive.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1544549508335, 'text': 'Thank you Danielle for your 5 star review, it was our pleasure to help!

<review>After finishing some remodeling/refinishing on our house, we needed our duct system upgraded to better fit our home. After using Anderson numerous times before (and signing up for their VIP program) they were the only company I wanted to come do the work. Samson and Pauly were punctual, courteous, and immediately put on their booties and laid down drop cloths to protect my floors. They explained to me what they would be doing today before even bringing their tools into the house. They were focused in their work, respectful, and had the house cleaned up before walking me through to show me the new changes, as well as turn the system on and off to ensure everything was spot on. I will continue to use Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air for all my plumbing, a/c and furnace needs!!</review><UserId.>103322901991051542072< /UserId.><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

<Review>Anderson does good work, especially if you need repairs within a short period of time. They are very expensive. They do give you upfront pricing, but not itemized pricing. It seems that the hourly rate can work out to $500-600 / hour on top of a trip charge. The tech also jumped into trying to sell several other high ticket items, before wanting to discuss the issue to be repaired. It is also not professional to drop hints on how much he earns, while you feel you are being overcharged. Had we been able to wait, our $1000 job could have been done for about $500.<//Review>< name>

We had our annual furnace inspection done by Eduardo A from Anderson. His service, attention to detail, and patience were exceptional. He put shoe covers on his feet before entering the house,  answered all questions asked of him regarding specs on the furnace. He was polite, professional and his work ethic is commendable.   Excellent decision in hiring him,  continue the great work.</review>

Dave was on time and fast! I don't normally have time to talk to service guys that come to the house. But Dave didn't just talk to fill dead air. He spoke to explain and educate me. I really enjoyed Dave's work.<//Text>

What a Professional!  Michael G. was my service tech.  Called Anderson to test the line pressure in my new mini-split system.  He was thorough, professional and most of all took the time to educate about my system and how best to maintain it.  Really felt he went above and beyond.  Will definitely use them again.</Review>

Excellent job.  Thank you, Ruben.  Would have no other plumbing & heating company do installations or repair work for us.  The technicians are very knowledgeable, efficient, and professional.  We had our AC/heating unit installed last year and very happy with the job.  Today it is a plumbing issue which has been resolved.  Next will be a replacement for our electric hot water heater.  Thank you Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air!!< /review>

<review>My house is older and has some big trees on the property, so I have had ongoing plumbing issues over the years.  I've just had the plumbing system replaced by Anderson, which was a two week job.  Every single person who came out was professional, experienced, communicative, and knowledgeabe.  There was also some follow-up work to be done, and again, the technicians were very helpful and knowledgeable.
I really think that Anderson has some of the best customer service of any company of any kind.  It is not just a slogan, but is completely true.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_name>

I called Anderson regarding a clogged kitchen sink. A tech was available the next day, and came out at a time that worked well for me.
Dylan was the tech, and did a great job. He was knowledgeable and friendly. I’m very impressed, and couldn’t have asked for a better experience.<//text>

They used to be fast and efficient.  but this weekend they lost a customer.  Friday night, with 12 guests at the house, my Mom's drain backed up while washing dishes..One they had worked on in September.  As  VIP customer, we were told the earliest appointment was Thursday, 5 days away!  Needless to say we called another company and got someone out the next morning.</review>

I have been using Anderson Plumbing for a long time.  I have found all the technicians to be courteous and professional.  On the last maintenance call for my furnace, a wire to the compressor came loose after the tech left, but she battled the traffic at the end of the day to return and fix it...much appreciated!</Review>

<review>I just had my furnace and air conditioning unit replaced by Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air.  My installer's name was Zachary Brock, and his assistant was Marcus.  Zac was very professional, friendly, and was always happy to answer any questions.  Both he and Marcus worked extremely well together and completed the install in a very timely manner.  They left the work area spotless and were always considerate to wear booties when walking in inside of the house.  I could not be happier with both of them.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

We have used Anderson Plumbing for small and large, simple and complicated, calm and crisis situations and they have come through every time.  Knowledgeable.  Courteous.  On time.  Fairly priced.  It's one of those rare companies where you actually feel a tinge of happiness writing the check, because you know that you are supporting a company that values things like excellence, professionalism, and the people they hire.< /Review>

I called for service and Sylvia went out of her way to get a Technician the same day I called. At first she said there were no appointments left for today. Sylvia consulted dispatch and told me a Highly Trained Technician would be arriving within 45 minutes. Tim Drumel arrived in 35 minutes! Tim's exceptional rapport and made me fell at ease right away. He performed a preliminary check and quickly went to work. He completed the job in an hour! (Clogged Toilet. Toilet had to be removed to snake sewer drain) I could tell that Tim was a professional. Quick, efficient, and great attention to detail. I am very satisfied with Tim's work. I forgot to mention that Sylvia also sent me an email before Tim arrived. It was a profile of Tim including a photo so you know exactly who is arriving to do the job. Thank you once again Tim for your good work ethic! Wow Thank you Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air!

He kept me apprised of what his plan for installing a new air duct in my guest bath and installing an air cleaner on my heating and air unit.  He took great care to keep the work area clean and swept up anything that was still on the floor when he finished.  All in all a great experience.< /Review>

Miguel one of the Drain Specialists at Anderson Plumbing and Heating was a pleasure to work with.  He was always available to explain various options for how to fix and improve my drain system.  He also pointed out ways we could save money.  Thank you Miguel!

Herman was the man on the job who did the work.  That guy can do anything from hammering thru a slab to the finesse work like soldering copper pipe supply lines.  My old 1959 house has awesome modern plumbing and drain system now.  He knows his stuff and explains everything in a friendly informative manner.  He came up with some great suggestions for improvements that I hadn't thought of.  The guy is pure gold!  Thank you Herman!</Text>

Exceptional service!!  Emergency call at nearly 4:00 pm to Anderson Plumbing on a plugged up toilet at my mother-in-laws house, they were able to send James B almost immediately and he quickly cleared the clog, checked the overall toilet function and all other bathroom drains.  We will be using Anderson Plumbing in the future.  Thanks so much, your Company provides exceptional services!</Text>

<user>110101384558728129311< /user><review>It started with a meeting with Fonzo, who was professional and willing to learn the specifics of my needs and who also dug into some of the details of my particular installation needs.
The installers, Jacob and Adrian, did outstanding work, with close attention to detail. They were willing to let me watch and involve myself into the job as much as I wanted. The job was, in my opinion, a tough one to accomplish, and Jacob and Adrian went above and beyond to get it done right.
Dennis visited the installation site and helped out in getting the compressor/condenser properly located. I believe it is always a good idea to have a supervisor at the job site to support the installers. Great job by all mentioned.</review></record></dataset><record>

James Blacker saved us from a very challenging clog in our main sewer outlet. He tried twice to reach it through an undersized cleanout, hoping to save us the cost to remove and replace the toilet - but this old house would not give up the fight so easily. James then consulted with me and I agreed to remove the toilet to give him better access. James doggedly refused to give up until he had a tricky reclosing congestion fully cleared. This was not routine (nothing in our old house ever is), but James rose to the challenge.

He was professional and courteous and communicated pricing and expectations clearly and honestly at every stage. In the end, he left us feeling the service was top notch and the price paid quite reasonable.

Anderson is lucky to have James Blacker. So were we.</Review>

<text>When my sixty year old cast iron pipes needed to be replaced a friend recommended Anderson Plumbing. I called them and Ricardo came out and looked at it. He explained what the problem was, what my options were and gave me an estimate. He was informative and professional. I decided to use their company. They were able to start the work in a couple of days,. Ruben and Michael were here every day on time and I have rarely seen men work so hard. In 100 degree heat. They had to dig up part of the slab in the garage, part of a sidewalk, my kitchen wall and big holes in my front lawn. Every night when they left everything was safe and tidy and put away, they were friendly and personable and knew what they were about. When the job was finished, everything had been restored, they even cut sod out of my lawn and replaced it perfectly. Ricardo made sure all was going well, which it was. They were respectful of me and my property, put up with my yappy little dog and all in all did an excellent job. I wholeheartedly recommend them and won't use anyone else. Top notch company!!< /text><username>Cathy Sparks<//username>< time>

Every time, the technician has arrived on time, and has been very nice, courteous, and respectful. I have never hesitated to let a single technician into my home. They seem like really nice people. Very professional.

Most of the time, there’s no upsell or extras… They come in, assess, and give recommendation options based on what they see. They provide hard facts and data to support their recommendations. There’s never any pressure to do anything. As a homeowner, I appreciate that. I appreciate each technician’s honesty and integrity. They always do good work on my house- and I definitely recommend Anderson PHA!</Text>< Pictures>

You receive a warranty for work done. They are careful of your property and leave it clean and safe each day when they finish.

<text>Excellent customer service. My issue didn’t end up being plumbing related but the technician helped me determine the source of the problem even though he easily could’ve walked away once he found out it wasn’t a plumbing issue. That kind of customer service seems like a rarity these days.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I bought and installed a new toilet from Anderson. The service technician was professional, patient, courteous, and really, really nice. During installation, he discovered the previous toilet was installed incorrectly and rather than leaving it as-is, he informed me and fixed everything before installing the new toilet. Even gave me good carpentry advice, in addition to good plumbing advice! Will be getting a call from me in the future for any plumbing jobs.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I called Anderson to inquire about completely replacing my HVAC system in my home. When I scheduled the appointment I was assured someone would be at my home at a specific time, and that person would contact me the day of the appointment to confirm. On the day of my appointment, I never received a phone call, and even at the time of my appointment no one showed up.  20 minutes after when my appointment was going to be I had to contact Anderson to find out what happened. The operator for Anderson said "yes I see you at an appointment set for a specific time, let me see where our person is" then I was told "they will be there in 15 minutes". Well 25 minutes later and still no show, so I had to contact Anderson again. This time the operator started out giving me attitude saying "you don't understand, we don't set specific times for appointments, we give time frames".  I was then placed on hold for about 10 minutes while the operator called the person to see where they were. When the operator returned they said "Our man is at your front door right now". I about snapped because I was standing out front of my house waiting and saw nobody.  I wonder how a company that says they have great customer service can treat someone like this who isn't even their customer, and is looking to them to become their customer. If a company is this unprofessional, rude and disrespectful I would not want them doing any business with me, let alone in my house.<//Review>

<Review>Anderson Plumbing, Heating, and Air has been great for each of the services I’ve used them for- and I’ve used them for all three!
Every time, the technician has arrived on time, and has been very nice, courteous, and respectful. I have never hesitated to let a single technician into my home. They seem like really nice people. Very professional.

Most of the time, there’s no upsell or extras… They come in, assess, and give recommendation options based on what they see. They provide hard facts and data to support their recommendations. There’s never any pressure to do anything. As a homeowner, I appreciate that. I appreciate each technician’s honesty and integrity. They always do good work on my house- and I definitely recommend Anderson PHA!<//Review><date>1530475401935< /date><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>It was a very nice experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  Our water heater was leaking and upon calling Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air - Julie answered the call and was extremely nice and helpful. She took the information and informed me that a Service Technician would be calling within the next 4 hours prior to coming out that afternoon.  Within 10 to 15 minutes, I received another call back indicating a Service Technician would be able to make it out within 1/2 hour to 1 hour. Ruben Reyes arrived within the hour - extremely fast service.  He promptly reviewed the situation and provided the options for replacing the water heater.  He was able to replace the water heater that same afternoon. In addition, to replacing the water heater he provided additional great customer service by looking at our water filtration system that was installed by Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air 5 years ago and it checked out ok.  Ruben even added additional piping outside where the water filtration system drains so it would go further away from the house and actually water more of the outside bushes when it does drain.  Great for us and the area especially with the local water issues.  Thank you again to a Great Staff at Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air - keep up the good work.</Text>< GmapID>

He was extremely professional and efficient.  We really appreciate all he did and he reassured us that Anderson would do everything they can to fix the problem.  It’s frustrating when there’s problems with your new unit but it’s very comforting to know that the Anderson VIP service is going to make it right as soon as possible.

A++ experience.  I had pipe start to leak about 1 month ago.  Called Anderson Plumbing and they were able to get someone out to my house quickly.  Chris B. fixed the leak and then recommended a whole home filter system to prevent future leaks.  I called this week to have the system installed and they still honored the quote given to me from a month ago.  Chris came back out to my home and installed the system in a timely and professional manner.  The work was top notch.  I am very pleased with the whole experience.  Recommend Highly!!!< /Review>

Would give no stars if that was an option. I made the appointment and the scheduler told me it would be a warranty job.  As soon as Ken got to the house he started arguing with me about warranty work etc...  Ultimately wasted my time, didn't offer to perform the job and argued with me all the way out the door. I was astounded with the fact Ken argued with me the whole time.  Lazy and not helpful at all.  Oh and they are the most expensive in the city.  ASI worked on my tankless heater for 80 dollars.  Anderson wanted over 200 plus a diagnostic charge of 200 despite the fact I told them the code was just to descale.</text>

This particular client is referencing work that we did not perform.  We did not install her faucet.  It was installed by her contractor.  We did provide her service last December that was required because the clients contractor had inadvertently severed a water line while doing a remodel.  It was raining outside.  Our technician arrived at the home around 7 PM.  The repair was preformed from outside  At no time did we even enter the home during this visit.  At a later date we were called to the home.  After explaining to the customer that the repair she was referencing was not ours, we did offer the customer several chargeable options including repair and/or complete replacement.  Our technician was asked at that time to leave the home which he did. We truly are sorry for any confusion.  I’m sure that holding us responsible for another contractors install was an honest mistake.  We would be happy to help this client rectify the situation including discounting any repair and/or replacement she might choose.  We would even be willing to go as far as to contact her initial contractor and share with him our findings.  I’m sure he would be willing to rectify any installation errors once he knew about them.  As always we appreciate Google providing us with a platform to reach out to our clients.\nThank you, Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air'}< /resp>

<text>When I first called Anderson Plumbing it was to fix the thermostat on my air conditioner. They told me that the unit was old (7 years old) and could not be replaced. That I would need to put in a new unit with new air conditioners. Having spent thousands of dollars with this company I figured that I had enough experience with them so that I could call them to fix a simple problem with the hot water in my shower. When they came I was told that I needed a new water softener unit for another few thousand dollars but my shower was fixed for the time being.
A couple of days later,when I had the same problem with the hot water in my shower, I made another appointment. At this appointment ,with another technician, I was told that I needed a different unit ,for another few thousand dollars, and the unit the first technician told me I needed wouldn't work. At this point I decided that I needed a second opinion from another company. In the meantime I found that the last guy they sent out had broken the hot cold water mixer on my shower. They escalated the problem to a repair supervisor who came out that week. He told me that they would have to replace the mixer on my shower, at no cost to me, and would call me in 2 days with an update as well as the exact cost of the new water softener unit he said I needed.
Two weeks later I still hadn't heard back from him. On the third week I received a message on my machine stating that the mixer had to be ordered from the manufacturer  and he would call me back the next day to discuss it. He had already tols me that it had to be replaced and I had foolishly assumed that he would do that first thing not three weeks later.
Three months later I still hadn't heard back from Anderson when I received an email message telling me it was time to make a service appointment on my air conditioners. I wrote back that I wouldn't be making any appointments with Anderson and to please remove me from their mailing list. That day I got a phone call from a very nice understanding lady who stated she was new to the job but that she was trying to straighten out problems that customer had had. She told me she would call Jose,the supervising technician who had come out the last time, and get back to me. True to her word she called me back the next day and informed me that she had ordered the part. She offered to call me every week to keep me updated which I declined.
Finally,after months, I got a call from her that the new part had come in and we made an appointment to install it.
The next time I tried to use my shower I found that only scalding hot water was coming out. No cold water to mix the hot water with. I called them to tell them what the situation was and she offered to send Jose back out to check on the problem. She informed me that since I had a tankless hot water system sometimes it took some time for the new unit to adjust. Now this explanation made no sense to me and if it makes sense to you then I'd suggest Anderson for your plumbing needs. It seems that in fixing one problem they always create a new one. To have them come out to try to fix it would be free but even at free it's far to expensive for me.
I wouldn't recommend Anderson to anyone  They're always   trying to sell you something new and can't seem to be able to do what they are hired to do correctly.
Stay far far away from this company.

< review>
I called Anderson to inquire about completely replacing my HVAC system in my home. When I scheduled the appointment I was assured someone would be at my home at a specific time, and that person would contact me the day of the appointment to confirm. On the day of my appointment, I never received a phone call, and even at the time of my appointment no one showed up.  20 minutes after when my appointment was going to be I had to contact Anderson to find out what happened. The operator for Anderson said "yes I see you at an appointment set for a specific time, let me see where our person is" then I was told "they will be there in 15 minutes". Well 25 minutes later and still no show, so I had to contact Anderson again. This time the operator started out giving me attitude saying "you don't understand, we don't set specific times for appointments, we give time frames".  I was then placed on hold for about 10 minutes while the operator called the person to see where they were. When the operator returned they said "Our man is at your front door right now". I about snapped because I was standing out front of my house waiting and saw nobody.  I wonder how a company that says they have great customer service can treat someone like this who isn't even their customer, and is looking to them to become their customer. If a company is this unprofessional, rude and disrespectful I would not want them doing any business with me, let alone in my house.< /review>

<Text>Would give no stars if that was an option. I made the appointment and the scheduler told me it would be a warranty job.  As soon as Ken got to the house he started arguing with me about warranty work etc...  Ultimately wasted my time, didn't offer to perform the job and argued with me all the way out the door. I was astounded with the fact Ken argued with me the whole time.  Lazy and not helpful at all.  Oh and they are the most expensive in the city.  ASI worked on my tankless heater for 80 dollars.  Anderson wanted over 200 plus a diagnostic charge of 200 despite the fact I told them the code was just to descale.<//Text>< pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1544806393782, 'text': '***ATTEMPTED RESOLUTION***\nThere seems to be some confusion with regards to the circumstances surrounding this call.  This particular client is referencing work that we did not perform.  We did not install her faucet.  It was installed by her contractor.  We did provide her service last December that was required because the clients contractor had inadvertently severed a water line while doing a remodel.  It was raining outside.  Our technician arrived at the home around 7 PM.  The repair was preformed from outside  At no time did we even enter the home during this visit.  At a later date we were called to the home.  After explaining to the customer that the repair she was referencing was not ours, we did offer the customer several chargeable options including repair and/or complete replacement.  Our technician was asked at that time to leave the home which he did. We truly are sorry for any confusion.  I’m sure that holding us responsible for another contractors install was an honest mistake.  We would be happy to help this client rectify the situation including discounting any repair and/or replacement she might choose.  We would even be willing to go as far as to contact her initial contractor and share with him our findings.  I’m sure he would be willing to rectify any installation errors once he knew about them.  As always we appreciate Google providing us with a platform to reach out to our clients.\nThank you, Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015<//Gmap_id></record>

Kevin did a great job explaining in detail the problem with your A/C unit.  He came in a timely manner from when we received the phone call of when he was expected to arrive. He was thorough with his assessment and took his time with what he recommended. We did not feel any pressure to move decide or move forward right then and there. He laid out all possible options and left reassuring us that either decision Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air would accommodate. Thank you for great customer service!<//Text>

Our A/C went out on Monday, we called Anderson for service and they came out on Tuesday, flipped the circuit breaker, it came on and they left. The temp didn't change with the motor running, so they came out again on Wednesday to install a new thermostat. The next day it still wasn't right, so we called them again and they couldn't get back to us until the following Monday! After a heat wave over the weekend, Monday arrived and they had to switch out two more thermostat's before it worked correctly. We would have been "Wow'd" if they fixed it correctly the first time and didn't make us wait four more days to help us out.</text>

I will request him for future appointments.

I am a VIP customer (cancelled) who had three problems in my bathroom.  A very knowledgeable technician arrived on time to bid on repairing problem.  Prices quoted were absurd, like an automobile repair,
Each item was individually priced: e.g.  $200 to put flapper on toilet and reinsert flush handle (I had the parts); $200 to look under sink to repair leak ( loose plastic nut on drain lever) and no quote to repair leaking faucet as he didn't have the part on truck even tho when I made the appointment I specifically stated the the make of the faucet handle.
Just beware of prices quoted.  Make sure you that you are able to do the work yourself, I did and saved $400 for less than a 20 minute repair.<//text>

<text>I contacted Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air to set up appointments for maintenance of my A/C and water heater. The staff and technicians were all very helpful, pleasant and efficient.  During a check of my home water pressure the technician, Ken Slater , discovered that my main water valve was not operating correctly which resulted in my water pressure to be approximately 115 psi, almost double what is recommended.  Ken was very helpful and courteous and I am glad he caught this before any major damage was done to my water lines.  Many thanks go to the Anderson employees.

Bryan Olson - Very prompt, professional.  Arrived in my place and find out the problem right away.  Corrected and double check my AC system and ensured that the whole system is working properly. My AC is up and running and enjoying the cool house during this hot weather.  Entire customer service was Superb and they was able to accommodate my service call in a few hour. Not next business day. Thank you Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air. Bryan is a keeper😀😀😀👍<//text>

Sal and Mac were the ultimate professionals.  They worked non-stop and were a delight to have in my home.  Sal spent way too much time cooking in my attic on a terribly hot day but never complained.  The work he did is excellent.  I highly recommend Anderson and Sal for anyone who needs a great HVAC system.</Text>

<Text>Our A/C went out on Monday, we called Anderson for service and they came out on Tuesday, flipped the circuit breaker, it came on and they left. The temp didn't change with the motor running, so they came out again on Wednesday to install a new thermostat. The next day it still wasn't right, so we called them again and they couldn't get back to us until the following Monday! After a heat wave over the weekend, Monday arrived and they had to switch out two more thermostat's before it worked correctly. We would have been "Wow'd" if they fixed it correctly the first time and didn't make us wait four more days to help us out.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015< /GmapID></record>

< Review>
I had my AC maintenance check and Mr. Johnny Castro was my HVAC Maintenance Technician.  He was very nice and professional and addressed all of my concerns and questions.  My AC unit was using excessive power which can effect the performance over the longterm so I purchased a fairly inexpensive device that significantly reduced the power demand into well within the normal range.  I really appreciated this suggestion to help extend the lifetime of my AC unit.  I was also using more air filters than I needed which was affecting the efficiency of my system.  I really appreciated the education about my AC system.  Johnny is very knowledgeable and personable. Having a technician that is highly competent and knowledgeable and who seems to care about me as a client is why I stay with Anderson Plumbing.  I am really thankful for their care for my home over the past years.  Thank you!<//Review>

<text>I am a VIP customer (cancelled) who had three problems in my bathroom.  A very knowledgeable technician arrived on time to bid on repairing problem.  Prices quoted were absurd, like an automobile repair,
Each item was individually priced: e.g.  $200 to put flapper on toilet and reinsert flush handle (I had the parts); $200 to look under sink to repair leak ( loose plastic nut on drain lever) and no quote to repair leaking faucet as he didn't have the part on truck even tho when I made the appointment I specifically stated the the make of the faucet handle.
Just beware of prices quoted.  Make sure you that you are able to do the work yourself, I did and saved $400 for less than a 20 minute repair.</text><Time>1531496925376<//Time><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>Eric Teran is a real pro! he's very personable and easy to talk to.  from the beginning you feel right at ease.  he explains everything clearly and takes time to answer any questions you have, even while he's working.  he did everything that was needed, and he left the work space very clean.  afterwords, he showed how everything was done and sat down to explain how everything works.  we're extremely happy with job.  it's so nice to have a QUIET hot water heater. there is no more banging coming from the garage and it works great!  you can send Eric back out anytime we need something fixed.
THANKS again eric

<text>After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Our landlord called them to come out and fix our A/C. They set up a time that worked around our time table. The tech, Michael, found the issue, called my landlord and dealt with getting the ok and fixed it. He also recommended other services our AC unit needed to the landlord and even emailed him for us. Good guy, knew his stuff, explained everything and dealt with out landlord.<//Text>

WOW -I had a problem with a tank less water heater.  I needed a "before noon"  appointment the next day and they made it happen. They were on time and very courteous and professional. They gave me 3 different options  to solve my problem.  Not a "you need this" attitude.  A picked my option and thought they would come back in a day or two to do the job.  That did not happen!! They ( Eric the tec ) went back to the shop and picked up everything need for the job. He returned and did the job right away.  That is customer service at it's best.  I will definitely be calling Anderson Pluming  in the future.  (that is if the need arises)   Thank's so much for your quality service.      David<//text>

I called Anderson at 8:15am with a main line block issue that was effecting our whole house. Although they were booked for the day they managed to rearrange tge schedule. By 9:30 the problem was fixed. Amazing service! Very professional and polite. I would highly recommend to anyone in need of plumbing or HVAC help. I will definitely use them again.< /text>

Oh my goodness!! This was my first experience with Anderson Plumbing and I hope I have to use them again!! Every step of the process was easy and I got an appt quickly. I received a heads up when they’d be there and then a call about what needs to be done and if I authorize the work. Then I received a follow up call that the work was completed. Which is the goal, but then I was educated on how to prevent it from happening again. Given tips on what to do if it does. It was just so nice to deal with someone that genuinely cared and not just going through the motions. Having things go wrong when life is already busy and full of stress sucks, but now I know if my sink clogs again and I call Anderson Plumbing they take of the hard part!!

Thank you again sooooooo very much!!!< /Review>

<Review>I was looking for a good contractor to provide me with a quote for a leaking water main pipe.  One contractor quoted me $7000 to do the repair and told me that it would take 5-7 days to fix.  I called several other contractors and was impressed with Ken's professionalism and knowledge.  The price he quoted for the work was a lot less than the initial quote that I got from the other company.  After meeting with several other contractors I decided to go with Anderson<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Anderson Plumbing rerouted our drain around the outside of the house, across the garage, and connected to main drain to street. All cutting of concrete were straight and cleanly cut. Everything was put back together and re-buried like it was prior to repairs done. Crew was very polite, and professional. Herman, the lead technician worked hard, and was very efficient with his work. He is a great asset to Anderson plumbing. I highly recommend Anderson to anyone that needs plumbing services.<//Review>

Jamar was unbelievable.  Friendly, professional and went the extra mile.  I had a water heater replaced and he also installed an electronic device for eliminating scale in my pipes.  A very good thing to do if you live in So. Cal.

GREAT JOB!</text>

Dave Grollman installed a new kitchen faucet for us.  He was very knowledgeable about the faucet we had selected and took time to explain the various options we had as far as positioning the operating handle.  Great job. Very friendly guy and we would be pleased to have him back next time we have a plumbing need.< /text>

I had a clogged sewer line at my home. Anderson was able to provide a prompt appointment. Larry F and Dylan were the technicians who came to my house. They were very professional. They explained the issue and walked me through the intended work. The pricing was upfront and accurate. I would recommend using Anderson Plumbing to anyone with plumbing issues.< /text>

Chris finished in the amount of time that was estimated at the start of the job.  He showed up on time. He appeared knowledgeable and completed the work efficiently and effectively.  The place was left clean.  He replaced a shower/bath combo fixture set which included opening up the wall and doing some pipe work.  I have confidence that we will love it for years to come.  He also replaced a valve under our kitchen sink.  So happy with the work.< /text>

< review>
After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!</review>

Anderson Plumbing was one of the only companies to return our call when we needed immediate service for our AC over the holiday weekend. They returned our call within 24 hours and had someone out to service the AC the very next day, (Maria really knows her stuff). The AC was up and running within a couple of hours. Everyone from the dispatcher to the office staff and our technician was professional, courteous and responsive.<//Review>

<review>Eric Teran is a real pro! he's very personable and easy to talk to.  from the beginning you feel right at ease.  he explains everything clearly and takes time to answer any questions you have, even while he's working.  he did everything that was needed, and he left the work space very clean.  afterwords, he showed how everything was done and sat down to explain how everything works.  we're extremely happy with job.  it's so nice to have a QUIET hot water heater. there is no more banging coming from the garage and it works great!  you can send Eric back out anytime we need something fixed.
THANKS again eric

Had kitchen drain clog that I could not get myself with snake, called Anderson, the technician was prompt, professional, knowledgeable and fixed the problem within a few minutes.  Wish I hadn't bothered myself first!  But he did give me tips on how to resolve the problem myself the next time- which I really appreciated.  Very impressed with this service.< /Review>

Plumber Justin and his assistant Anthony have done an excellent job installing my new tankless Noritz water heater in the garage. Justin was fabulous at explaining the care and use of the new water heater. The installation went like clock work. Anderson’s Plumbing worked me into their installation schedule so I wouldn’t be without hot water. I will tell my friends and neighbors the great service I got at Anderson’s Plumbing!< /text>

<Review>I am saddened that you are losing Jacob Berry, He is one of the best young men I have ever had the pleasure to have work in or on my home.  He is articulate and cogent in his discussions with me at every step he was taking on the Air Conditioning system he was servicing.

He is the type of young man which expresses what your Logo says.  I actually though he said, "Nobody loves clients like we do" and of course I though, how perfectly it suits the person Jacob is.  That was until I went to your site and realized that had said the word "Wows", not "Loves" and had myself a good laugh, because I have hearing aids that sometimes do not pick up intonations or certain verbal cues.

Next year when I have my system serviced, I would hope that you send someone like Jacob who helps me feel very confident in their capabilities and willingness to share their knowledge.

I am very particular about the types of service people I have work on my stuff, whether it was my new roof, or having my car service, or my plumbing work done.  Anderson has proven so far that they will be my go to company to take care of my STUFF !!

Sincerely
James Thomas<//Review>< Rate>

We called and got a tech on the same day which was a blessing. We are very pleased with the speed of service and the technician they sent.<//review>

WOW -I had a problem with a tank less water heater.  I needed a "before noon"  appointment the next day and they made it happen. They were on time and very courteous and professional. They gave me 3 different options  to solve my problem.  Not a "you need this" attitude.  A picked my option and thought they would come back in a day or two to do the job.  That did not happen!! They ( Eric the tec ) went back to the shop and picked up everything need for the job. He returned and did the job right away.  That is customer service at it's best.  I will definitely be calling Anderson Pluming  in the future.  (that is if the need arises)   Thank's so much for your quality service.      David</Text>

After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!< /text>

I just had a LOT work done on my heating and air conditioning system and couldn't be more pleased. A fantastic job was done by John C. and Donald M. They were extremely courteous, efficient and patient in explaining what they were doing. It took them a couple of days to give you an idea of how much work I had done and not because they were slow. They worked quickly and expertly. They covered all the areas that they had to work in and when finished, you wouldn't even know they were there. Anderson Plumbing has several employees that I have had the need for service and they were ALL TOP QUALITY in what they had to do. These two men were even better than that. Anderson Plumbing is the way to go!!<//review>

As always Anderson Plumbing sent out another terrific tech Ruben R researched the problem and was able to fix it in a timely manner.
We have had so many issues with plumbing and heating in one unit. All has been resolved very professionally. You are a great company there in San Diego. I'm glad that I saw one of your trucks outside of Home Depot on Sports Arena Blvd.and called.
Thank you

Dick Crandall was the representative that came to my house and gave me a bid, and explained to me exactly what  work was going to be done. Jacob and Adrian were the installers. They were professional, knowledgeable, and very courteous. They both possess great people skills. I was given a job time estimate of 3 days, but the guys were so proficient at their job, that they finished the whole job in only 2 days. There were also 2 other great young men that came out and did the electrical work for my heating& AC upgrade, and they also re-ducted my whole system. I am completely satisfied with the job. I am 100% satisfied with the whole Anderson team effort. I would recommend this company, and their great employees to anyone.</review>

Everything is good, prices are okay, employees are knowledgable and considerate. My only problem is that overtime I get a check up - - mostly included with a VIP program purchase -- which is pre-paid under the program membership... well, they find something wrong and then it costs $$ to fix it. I might now try to just wait until something goes wrong and find a local independent source to 'fix the problem' rather than pay for X-amount of 'included' check ups which just seem to find things wrong though mostly things are working smoothly.< /text>

<Review>I was impressed throughout every step of the experience. I filled out an online request for an appointment on Sunday, Monday at 8:30am I received a call to schedule an appointment. during the scheduling I was informed about Anderson Plumbing Co. I felt comfort right away in my selection, My appointment was book the next day. I received a call 1/2 hour before arrival and they were right on time. The tech James was knowledgeable and professional. He discovered the source of leak within 5 min, and completed the faucet replacement in 45min. What a difference Anderson Plumbing was to it larger San Diego competitor. I won't be using Howe Plumbing anymore.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Anderson PHA is fortunate to have an excellent staff working for them. They took care of our major drain repair with skill and confidence, and explained the steps along the way.

They also recently did a faucet repair and did an excellent job.<//Review>

Donald did an excellent job of installing the air-conditioning unit. It took two and a half days to complete the job and during that time we did not experience any major interruptions to our daily routine of caring for our eight month old granddaughter.  Donald was extremely courteous and very polite.  He always had a smile for our granddaughter and would let us know when and if we needed to go to an area of the house where there was less noise and dust in the air.  He would check with us if he had a question and keep us informed of the progress of the job. I can’t say enough good things about Donald. It was a pleasure to have him and his coworker in our home.  Needless to say he and Jose were very professional and extremely proficient. they are  a beacon to others in the profession. It is with deep appreciation for a job well done that I write this review!</Text>

<review>Anderson Plumbing is my new favorite plumbing company here is San Diego. I've used them twice now and have been happy both times. The office staff are courteous and helpful. Both times they sent someone right away even though it was not an emergency. Both technicians were so great. They made good future suggestions and fix the issue at hand quickly and gave us the best price possible. I actually have several plumbers in the family but in other states. With Anderson's nearby I no longer feel bad that my family plumbers are not around. Tim was so sweet to my mother (a bit of a talker) patiently listening to a story or two-LOL

<review>Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air just installed a new heater and AC in our home.

1st, EVERYONE I came in contact with from Anderson was HAPPY, Friendly and appeared to enjoy the job.  Positive people make everything OK.

Our Sales Consultant Javier C was one of the only Sales people I remembered. We got several quotes.  He listened to me...I had a lot to say.  He was knowledgeable without throwing out all of the jargon from his industry.  Javier did not bug me...respected my space let me make decisions.  He did not manipulate our time.  He DID not bash his competitor.  He is sharp!  I did not feel like I was being ripped off.  Javier was honest.  Note: to Anderson competitor's bashing ones competition is a very unattractive tool to use, so stop it.

CLEAN no one looked like a worker.  One of gentlemen John C. very nice got his shirt dirty in our attack (who does not have a dirty attack) and let us know he was going to the truck to change it!  This group made me feel good about paying!  Another gentleman seen my darling dog get out and let me know even while my husband shushed him. Wonderful!

The best compliment I can give is to recommend Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air.  Which I will do!</review><user>105991862552334082015< /user>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><review>Smelled gas coming from beneath our stove, which is very alarming. Shut off the valve underneath, aired out the kitchen, but hours later still smelled a bit of gas. Called something like 5 different plumbers asking for help as I have three young kids in the house and a wife who is due to have our fourth ANY MINUTE! Very much a serious situation. Despite this, every plumber I called either didn't respond or they were too busy to help. Then, I realized a family member recently used Anderson and she gave me the name and number of the actual technician that helped her out so I gave them a call and asked for James by name.  They appreciated how urgent this situation was, and James came out right away. He and his teammate arrived and were pleasant to work with from the start. They were always professional, and obviously experts at what they do. Throughout the entire process they communicated with us frequently so we always knew what was going on, what progress they've made, what their recommendations are, and what options we had. They were also very clear and direct with the costs associated with each option, and we never felt pressured into paying some exorbitant amount for optional services. They worked hard the entire time, being very sensitive to my family's particular situation. After the gas leak was fixed, James came back a few more times in the following days to do further tests to make absolutely certain things were done right and that everything was still holding up after they made the repairs. He even came out personally to meet with underground leak detection services (a third party), spoke to city gas company on our behalf to get our gas turned back on, and worked directly with the city inspectors office to get all the appropriate inspections and paperwork in order. Now, my family has gas service again! More importantly, this means we have a working clothes dryer, furnace, and HOT WATER. I could not have asked for a better experience in an otherwise really difficult situation.</review>< Pictures>

I called on 9/9 around 5:00 and was able to schedule an appointment for the next day.  Technician (James P) arrived around 1:00 and had the air back on around 2:00.  We are always satisfied with our service calls, but knowing that Anderson was swamped with services calls AND they were able to accommodate us the next day is amazing!  Thank you Anderson Plumbing and an extra thanks to James P!!</Review>< Pictures>

This was the first time I called Anderson for my plumbing needs.  Larry was able to come out the next day.  He explained in detail how the drains worked, where problems might occur and offered suggestions on ways to extend the life of some of our new fixtures.  Our plumbing problem is pretty extensive so he crawled under the house to identify the problem.  We had to clean up the sewage spill and he was able to recommend a company to do it before they could repair the damage.  In the end, they appeared to know their business inside and out and I felt comfortable using them.</text>

<Review>Anderson Plumbing has completely unreasonable prices. Honestly, I really can't understand how they can have so many 5 star reviews unless people really don't care how much they pay for plumbing service.  Here are the facts of my case: I had a plumbing leak which they located for $262 when two other plumbers where quoting $130 for leak location.  I went with Anderson since they were the first to be able to come to my house.  After they found it they quoted $900 to repair a simple copper elbow. Another company quoted me a third the cost over the phone. Then came and fixed it in less than 30 mins.  It is sad to think some customers unfamiliar with plumbing rates trusting a company's quote as fair and paying literally $1800 per hour for a simple job, but if you go with Anderson be prepared for that sort of sticker shock.  Funny their tag line is "Nobody wows customers like we do."  Wow!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1517523859120, 'text': 'Thank you Mr. Lie for your review.

Dylan and Dana are five stars!!  I had been told by another plumber that my drainage system (for washer & dishwasher) was not working & probably not fixable, and they offered no further help.   In a state of high anxiety, I called Anderson around 8:30AM and Dylan & Dana arrived around noon.  Dylan removed years of sludge from the drainpipes & declared the problem solved.  He is an exceptionally knowledgeable plumber--best I've had.  Dana is in the plumbing program at Anderson's & she will be great.  They are both very smart & very nice. From now on, I will use Anderson for all my plumbing needs.<//text>

<text>I had my VIP AC service done a few days ago.  The technician was very nice and respectful.  After he had left, I noticed a strange hum coming from the vent.  I called Anderson the following day and reported the hum.  They came out today and discovered that it was the type of filter that was installed.  It wasn't the type I had used in the past, so it was making a different noise.  He replaced the filter and the strange hum disappeared.  The technician apologized for the unpleasant noise, even though it was not due to an error on his part.  Anderson really appreciates my business and I am very happy with their service.  The VIP service is great.</text><Date>1441061339777< /Date>< Rate>

I called Anderson plumbing to replace a water heater. Their bid was $2100 for a simple 40 gallon in a garage. Don't use this company!!! Way too expensive! Twice as much as I ended up spending! He said it would take 1/2 a day...it took a better part of an hour! This company has inflated prices.</review>

James B evaluated the problem I am having with my area drain and explained the various treatment options in terms that I could understand.

In addition, I mentioned a possible plumbing problem that causes noises throughout the night and he diagnosed a problem with my toilet flapper seal.

I am very grateful for the way in which he answered my questions with such detail; he was not rushed and was very patient, in addition to being professional and knowledgable.</text>

We called Anderson to fix our master bath shower.  While we were using our guest shower, it started leaking.  Anderson fixed that as well.  They called to let us know when they would arrive.  Technician arrived on time.  He answered all of our questions.  Was fast and efficient and knew what he was doing, many years of experience.

I would recommend Anderson Plumbing.</Text>

<Review>I think Larry did a great job; left the area clean, etc.  I have a problem being charged $220 and they refuse to give me a warranty.  Because I wouldn't pay $551 for a drain pop up assembly, they won't warranty the work!

Again, I don't blame the technician, but the company policy he is instructed and well-trained I might add to sell.  I saw through it, but needed by sink fixed.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Mr Johnny Castro did a thorough maintenance in our AC. He did go to the attic to check the furnish. He did spend a lot of time checking the unit outside. Refrigerant is in low charge and added a solution  or something in the system (3.++ lbs). He also put some dye to the system for leak search and will follow through on a scheduled appointment on Aug 6, 2018. He will also come back on Sunday for the right size of the filter to put in.
In the past, last year when they installed the unit there were quite a bit of issues. There was a kind of leak in the system but did not do a leak search in particular to find where it's coming from.
So far today, we are pleased with what Mr. J. Castro had instituted. Job well done, thank you!
We are looking forward to solve this issue, and enjoy the rest of Summer months!</text>

We have always had good results from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air.  If we had a complaint, it was always fixed right away.

Reggie came to our home to fix a plumbing problem we were having.  His work was impeccable on other items repaired; however, the repair on the flusher and flapper on the toilet needed a minor adjustment and that was taken care of the next day by another technician (Sorry, I do not know his name).

Reggie did find the equipment attached to the water heater to push hot water into the master bath had not been turned on.  He gave me instructions as to how it turns on and how to regulate the timer.  Not sure if it had ever been turned on since it was installed several years ago. It is working perfectly as the hot water comes in immediately.  We installed this equipment to save water instead of running the water ahead of time in order to take a warm shower.  I gave Reggie five stars as he went out of his way to show me how to regulate this equipment.  He went above and beyond.<//Review>

<review>We had a slow draining kitchen sink.   I hesitated calling a contractor, as many times in the past, we have had issues with calls not being returned.   This was certainly not the case with Anderson Plumbing.  I requested an appointment online, they called me shortly, and our appointment was set for that afternoon.  Larry called and said they could come earlier, which worked out great!  We also received an email with pictures of the technicians and said they were on their way.   We received a complete explanation of the work before they began and upon completing the job, Jimmy explained their findings and that our issue had been resolved.   Job well done!!!   I will never hesitate to call Anderson Plumbing if we ever have any plumbing issues in the future.   Thank you Larry & Jimmy!< /review><date>1462650116135</date>< response>

Ken was very professional and courteous. He explained the repair, cost and VIP service.
He also did the repair in a timely manner and seem knowledgeable. We also asked if he would assess our water heater and circulating pump, because it is now time to replace it.<//Text>

Ricardo has always been an honest and pleasant individual.  Anytime we make an appointment with Anderson Heating and Plumbing, we always want to have him come out because he is so comfortable to work with.  Anderson Heating and Plumbing always have the best customer service which is why I will never go with anyone else for any plumbing or heating service I need.  There’s a reason why they say “Nobody Wow’s clients like we do!”, because they definitely do everytime.  Thank you Ricardo for all of your hard work!< /review>

As always Anderson Plumbing sent out another terrific tech Ruben R researched the problem and was able to fix it in a timely manner.
We have had so many issues with plumbing and heating in one unit. All has been resolved very professionally. You are a great company there in San Diego. I'm glad that I saw one of your trucks outside of Home Depot on Sports Arena Blvd.and called.
Thank you

Larry was professional, knowledgable, and courteous from the moment I met him.  The plumbing problem he was called to address was complicated and  due to  poor design by the builder, not straight forward in its resolution.  Larry methodically attacked the problem, and kept me informed of his efforts as the job progressed.  It is rare that I have had a technician come into my home and earn my immediate trust. Larry is an outstanding ambassador for Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air. Additionally, because of Larry,  I intend to call Anderson for future plumbing, heating and air conditioning difficulties at both my home and business. Thanks.<//Review>

<Review>I had the flow-tech device installed, and there’s a connection problem whenever I use the washing machine.  I have to unplug the device while using the washing machine.  When they installed the new furnace, they broke the doorknob on the back door.  I had the water heater flushed and the thermal expansion tank installed, and the water heater is making a dull thud when the toilet is flushed or the faucet is turned on.< /Review>< gmapID>

They went above and beyond what was asked and kept us informed of everything being done through the entire project.  They made sure that we were completely satisified with the work before leaving.

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This was my first time contacting a plumbing company for a repair on my home and couldn't have been happier.  I really appreciated the upfront pricing - they explained this over the phone.  Eric T. arrived a few minutes earlier than expected and after hearing my explanation and looking at the PRV valve he knew that was the problem.  He also suggested replacing the main shutoff valve because of the age and I knew it was an honest recommendation and not just trying to sell additional services.  Eric did a great job with the repair and everything looked just as it did after he left, with the exception of a nice new pressure regulator valve.  I'd definitely use Anderson again!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I just had central air conditioning installed after living in my house through 21 years of hot summer heat. A group of young men named Joe Smithey, Brent Phillips, and Johnny Castro were the team of technicians who helped turn my house into a refrigerator.They were very courteous, knowledgeable, professional and hard working. The installation of my Lennox air conditioner went smoothly without any problems. If it weren't for the cold air coming out of the vent ducts, you couldn't tell that the unit was running. Impressive!</review>

I was very pleased with the experience thanks to the expertise and proficient technician. He explained all the steps that was needed before he preformed  them and answered all my questions. This was very important to me because I know nothing about plumbing matters. He completed the job in the timeframe that he gave before he started the job. I am impressed and will recommend Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air to all my friends and co-workers.</text>

Plumbing sucks but Anderson is awesome.  We had Anderson install a cleanout the last time our line backed up.  This time Dylan came out within an hour and really took his time to make sure I was correct about the problem.  Then he cleared the lines, cleaned everything and made triple sure that everything was working great before he left.  Plumbing, especially sewage is very stressful, Dylan's, here to help you, attitude was so refreshing.< /text>

We received superb customer service from Syn S. during a messy situation. He was efficient, effective and provided sound advice. He went above and beyond in helping this stressed-out mother of two clean up the situation and was able to arrange a follow-up service on the spot. I will definitely be using Anderson Plumbing again and asking for Syn!</Review>

Junior (technician) came to our home to evaluate our non functioning furnace. He was here several hours, and did great work in figuring out the problems, by replacing burned out circuit boards and other parts.  When he left the furnance was working.  He was concerned that something else might have been wrong. He called back in a few hours to check on its functioning, and by that time, it was not working correctly.  He had suggested we consider evaluating the need for a new furnance, since we were replacing so many parts.  We greatly appreciate his honesty and helpfulness with our whole situation.  We did in fact, talk to an Anderson advisor the next day, which helped us make the correct decision in replacing the furnace and original duct work.  We were unaware that the duct work was inefficient, and appreciated the information.
We now have a new furnace, with new duct work, which already appears to be more economical for us.
Thank you Anderson for employing great employees, like Junior, who was professional, courteous and very knowledgeable.</text>

Rudy came by and spent two hours trying to properly diagnose the problem. We had had issues with our heater since last year and both times we had another company come out they gave a quick look and a huge invoice, but neither time were they correct on the issue. I was extremely impressed the the availability, and professionalism of the technician as well as the staff at Anderson Plumbing and Heating.<//Text>

I called Anderson Plumbing to repair a bathroom sink drain that was leaking.  I also had several small plumbing related jobs that I really did not want to do myself so I decided to have them perform this work in addition to the repair.  I had never contacted a plumbing service before and decided on Anderson Plumbing because they have been in business for so long and had a great rating with the BBB.  I can honestly say that it was a pleasure working with this company.  The phone representatives are polite and courteous.  The technician showed up on time, treated my home with care, and conducted himself in a professional manner.  The visit started with a walk through and discussion about the work to be performed, some Q&A, full disclosure of the charges (the forms they use are very detailed), and lastly a time estimate to complete the work.  The plumber, Reggie, did a wonderful job.  When he finished we performed another walk-through to review the repairs.  He answered all of my questions and provided some helpful tips.  I would definitely use this company again.< /Review>

We were in a crisis with an unsuccessful attempt to snake our kitchen drain.
James arrived when they said he would; he was very professional, putting on booties over his work shoes to protect our carpet. He explained everything he could do, and the cost, etc.
Our problem was resolved well and I think my husband and I feel a little more educated about our own plumbing issues which are unique as the kitchen had been remodeled by the prior owner. Needless to say, the owner had made several errors!
We'll definitely use Anderson again!
Thank you James!<//text>

The technician from Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air, sent to my house was Victor Jimenez.  He was thoroughly professional and knowledeable.   He treated me with respect and courtesy.  I am very happy with the work done.  I have been using Anderson plumbing since 2010.  He knew exactly what the problem was and proceeded to fix it in an efficient and correct manner.< /Review>

We called Anderson Plumbing because we had a slab leak.  Erik Egerstrom,  the plumbing technician came out in a timely manner.  He spent a lot of time looking for the leak and explaining everything to us.  He recommended that we call a leak detection company, which we did.  He followed up with us, and came out to give us a quote on repair.  He worked with us on pricing and was very professional and honest about what we needed and didn't need.  When he came to do the work, he and his apprentice got here at 9:30 AM and worked until 10:30 PM  because he wanted to make sure we had water for the weekend.  He then followed up after the weekend and finished the rest of the work.  Erik was professional, very knowledgeable and best of all honest!!  The drywaller and office staff were wonderful as well.  Thank you Anderson!!</Review>

We have used Bernard on several occasions, the latest being last week.  He is always very professional, knowledgeable and helpful.  Very trust worthy - you do not feel like you've been taken.  Anderson Plumbing guarantees its work and it is a pleasure doing business with it and its employees.  Thankfully we now have a great plumbing company we can trust and feel good about calling whenever we have plumbing problems.

Thank you very much!

This is the second time I have called Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air for service. The first time was a year ago. Both service went to pretty well. I have received excellent services with very knowledgeable technicians. I'd like to say THANK YOU Jesse Salcido for your great service to unclog my drain. Your capability of prompt diagnosis of the problem impressed me. Thank you again.< /Text>

Ken Slater was very knowledgeable and helpful! He explained the problem so we could understand the issues and provided options on how to fix the problem! He explained the installation and why some items had to be added to pass inspection. He installed the new water heater and cleaned up very well afterword. Ken answered all the questions we had so we could understand them.</Text>

I just had central air conditioning installed after living in my house through 21 years of hot summer heat. A group of young men named Joe Smithey, Brent Phillips, and Johnny Castro were the team of technicians who helped turn my house into a refrigerator.They were very courteous, knowledgeable, professional and hard working. The installation of my Lennox air conditioner went smoothly without any problems. If it weren't for the cold air coming out of the vent ducts, you couldn't tell that the unit was running. Impressive!< /text>

< Review>
Ron, the plumber was great! . I told him the property was in the middle of selling and we needed this I spection for the buyers today. We had requested a non intrusive camera scope to verify if there was a leak or moisture inside the wall. When he walked in empty handed I asked if he had the camera with him, he replied no, then I went off and reacted terribly.  Even though I was a l irrate, he remained calm.  I told him the owner specifically requested it when she ordered them to come out.  He immediately called his office to see what the issue was and found out that for some reason, whomever took the appointment did not put that in the call notes.
He calmly recommended some options of cutting into the wall and what that cost would be, or would have to wait until the plumber with the scope could be scheduled. We decided to remove a piece of drywall ourselves so he could look in and he thoroughly inspected the area visually and what he couldn't see he stuck his arm in the wall to feel around for any water or dampness. He was gracious the entire time and explained everything so clearly and calmed me down.  He also wrote up the findings on his tablet and emailed it directly to us while he was still on site. What a fantastic man and employee you have!  Sincerely, Denise Lisa, the owners realtor. I will definitely recommend your company to all of my clients. However please make sure your schedulers understand what the client is asking for, what type of plumber they need and write everything the customer requested, verbatim, in the remarks!</Review>

I called Anderson Plumbing because they had a discount rate for Air Conditioning check up.  I expected them to try to sell me a new one because mine is about 10 years old.  My Service Specialist was Javier. He was professional and friendly. He explained what he would do and why.  He checked out everything, and I could see that he knew what he was doing.  He checked out the unit inside and changed the filters and even vacuumed out the closet it was enclosed in.(it was really dusty)  He finished by installing a booster to the unit to get a few more years out of it.  I could tell the difference immediately!  I will continue to use this Company for all of my future needs. I felt that they are knowledgable and honest, and I will ask for Javier because he exceeded my expectations.</text>

This is the second time I have called Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air for service. The first time was a year ago. Both service went to pretty well. I have received excellent services with very knowledgeable technicians. I'd like to say THANK YOU Jesse Salcido for your great service to unclog my drain. Your capability of prompt diagnosis of the problem impressed me. Thank you again.< /Text>

All staff I talked to were very professional and quick to respond, however prices are out of line.  I was quoted over $800 to repair a leaking toilet valve (they called it a "rebuild").   I could not afford that so called another plumber who was highly recommended.  He came right out, fixed it in less than an hour and charged me $184.   The difference in cost was staggering.</Review>

I have subscribed to Anderson Plumbing VIP preventative maintenance program for years. They have maintained my plumbing, heating and AC in excellent condition and I believe prevented unnecessary problems and inconvenience. They perform exceptional service with friendly and knowledge technicians and providing me peace of mind.< /review>

Had problem with a toilet wobbling and leaking water from under base.  Problem was caused by previous plumber incorrectly setting a new toilet in place by trying to use two wax seals to make up for the flange being lower and not flush with the finished tile floor level.  Alex installed a new flange, level with the finished floor, and a new wax seal and then set the new toilet in place, using shims to eliminate any wobbling, and finally caulked around the entire base.  Alex was professional, courteous, and explained fully what he had to do, what the cost would be before he proceeded, then did the work and thoroughly cleaned up after himself when the work was completed.  will certainly use the company again if and when the need arises.< /Text>

<text>My 95 year old grandparents that have lived in the same house since 1953 had their water heater go out. They are on a fixed income and when something like this happens our family steps in to help. I am a general contractor and was working in LA at the time. Andersons Plumbers assessed the problem and fixed it within a couple of hours.
This company has the best interest of their clients in mind and no doubt I will be using them in the future.
Thank you to everyone that turned this nightmare into a pleasant experience.<//text>< date>

The first time was in June for A/C repair.  Today was for plumbing.  Both times I have been thoroughly impressed with the technicians’ knowledge and ability to complete the job quickly and efficiently.  This time I signed up for their VIP program because I know that I have a few more plumbing issues coming my way over the next 12 months and after today’s service, I wouldn’t call anyone else to do the job!  The technician that did my plumbing repair today was Ken Slater.  Ken was very professional and friendly, as well as being an expert plumber!  Ken gave me some recommendations to try and avoid the same situation in the future.  Thanks Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air for being a fantastic and reliable company!  You’ve got all of my future business!<//text>< Pics>

Outstanding customer service!!! Dave Grollman was right on time! Professional from the start to the finish. Did the work as promised, and did an outstanding job! At a great price too!!! Did a free inspection for me with one of the bathroom fixtures. Made excellent reccomendation's and replaced a leaky shut off valve under the kitchen sink free of charge! He brought me up to speed on some of the services offered by Anderson for A.C. and Duct inspections. Looking at A.C., and Anderson is in the lead at the moment.!!<//review>

Fernando has provided us with service before so we ask for him whenever possible. We are long time customers of Anderson plumbing. Fernando is the reason we always take advantage of their services.</Review>< date>

Ken Slater was very knowledgeable and helpful! He explained the problem so we could understand the issues and provided options on how to fix the problem! He explained the installation and why some items had to be added to pass inspection. He installed the new water heater and cleaned up very well afterword. Ken answered all the questions we had so we could understand them.</review>

<Review>I used Anderson for their plumbing services and I was satisfied with that work.  Despite being over priced, I liked both of the technicians who came to my house.  However, I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with HVAC services that I received.  The technician came to my house and instead of assessing all possible options (which I later learned there were other, cheaper options), he went straight to the $1300 blower motor option, which knowing nothing about HVAC, I figured that was what was needed.  The technician installed the blower motor and it worked for less than 24 hours.  Anderson came back and this time brought back a salesman who tried to pressure me into spending 9-10 THOUSAND dollars on a completely new system.  I felt very uncomfortable about the sales tactics and I could tell that my technician was also uncomfortable.  Eventually the salesperson left and the technician agreed to try a simple remedy, adding refrigerant to the system.  They were originally going to try to charge me $200 for this, but decided to spare me the expense.  The system worked for only a few hours.  I eventually changed the outlet and that got the system working for a couple of weeks.

It broke again, and after talking to other professionals in the area and my family friend back at home about it, they explained that I was completely ripped off and completely overcharged for something that failed to work.  They also explained that the prices that they were quoting me for a new system were completely absurd.  I feel completely taken advantage of; the company realized that my spouse and I were not savvy in the HVAC realm and they pounced on the opportunity to make as much money from us as possible.

I ultimately hired a new professional to fix my broken system and they explained that the motor that was installed by Anderson had already broke and also that there were other fixes to try prior to replacing the blower motor originally.  I tried to get some or all of my money back from Anderson, but they were very difficult to reach, have given me the runaround, and refuse to do anything because I did not give them the opportunity to fix the problem.  I explained that I know that they took advantage of me and that I was uncomfortable with their sales tactics and they just choose to slander the professional that I used to fix the problem and try to affix the blame on me in any way possible.

If you cannot tell, I am completely dissatisfied with the assistance that I received from Anderson and I will never use them ever again and will be sure to tell anyone who will listen to never use them again.  They just want your money and will pretend to be helpful and charming in an attempt to get you to trust them and spend all kinds of money on things that you do not need.

**Update**
Erin and her team helped resolve the issue and I am grateful that she took the time to reach out to me to see what was going on and make sure that we were taken care of.</Review>< Pictures>

<date>1507058390341< /date><Rate>5</Rate><review>While searching for another plumbing company, their name came up and I saw the good reviews so I decided to check it out. They had a 49 dollar internet special for camera inspection and drain cleaning, but a little out of my area, so there was a 41 dollar extra charge. Appointment was immediate and Tim showed up early in the morning, did his magic and viola, everything was functional. He didn't have the camera with him so he gave me a free camera inspection coupon along with some other specials. I am more than happy for their prompt service and no hidden charges, affordable charge with everything was disclosed, like how much it will be (total was $91 as opposed to 240 dollars that Roto Rooters was giving me the estimate for) . I would highly recommend them.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I am so glad I had Anderson Plumbing , Heating & Air service my air conditioner. The Technician was respectful and clean and knew his product very well.

What I really appreciated was they offered a service and did just that. I mean I was not told I needed all these extra parts or service from Quentin the tech who came to work on my air conditioner.

You really love it when you do not feel pressure nor feel you're being scammed.

Anyway love, love this company will definitely use them again.

Kind Regards

< Review>
I called Anderson Plumbing because they had a discount rate for Air Conditioning check up.  I expected them to try to sell me a new one because mine is about 10 years old.  My Service Specialist was Javier. He was professional and friendly. He explained what he would do and why.  He checked out everything, and I could see that he knew what he was doing.  He checked out the unit inside and changed the filters and even vacuumed out the closet it was enclosed in.(it was really dusty)  He finished by installing a booster to the unit to get a few more years out of it.  I could tell the difference immediately!  I will continue to use this Company for all of my future needs. I felt that they are knowledgable and honest, and I will ask for Javier because he exceeded my expectations.</Review>

Im very happy with their service, we had to do a major fix and Ricardo told us the problem and showed the video of our pipes, there were roots  giving is trouble for months! (I had several plumbers coming in and this company is the only one who showed us the video)

After a week of them fixing it, the water backed up again, so I called them and they sent someone immediately and took care of the problem right away, under the lifetime warranty.

Thank you Anderson plumbing! And Ricardo the project manager.</text>

Just now wrapping up the installation of a completely new HVAC system. These guys were one of three  companies to quote us and by far the least professional,  knowledgeable, and affordable. When Paul  came and to take a look at our systen back in April for a quote,  he immediately said he had never seen one as old as ours and didn't know what to do.  Old? Yes.  Not knowing what to do even when you are the expert? Not a good thing.  His recommendation was to ask my neighbors (who just got theirs replaced) what they did and then call him back. Needless to say,  I was livid. Once pressed, he emailed me with an estimate on something he "thought" would work for over $12,000. So, beyond the horrible service and lack of professionalism, they were also really overpriced. I went with a different, extremely well rated family owned company who was literally HALF the cost; same quality system and similar warranty; and knew immediately what to do when they saw our outdated system. I can't speak to their other services, however I would strongly recommend NOT using this company for HVAC needs.<//text>

Ryan was our technician, he arrived early, explained to us what the cost would be.  He had our problem fixed in a matter of minutes.  We have been searching for a plumber and heating and air company for about 6 months. I am so happy we found Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air. We will be using them for all of plumbing, heating and air.

Finding a company who cares about the service they perform these days is very rare.  Anderson is that company.</text>

Contacted Anderson Plumbing for a slab leak. Brian was the tech that came out, and he gave us a recommendation and the cost. Did a copper re-rout that led to the kitchen. A week later another copper pipe leak showed up in a different area. Requested that Brian come back out to investigate. Found a pin hole leak in the copper pipe which he spot repaired to stop the leak. Based on the two leaks we discussed a full copper re-pipe of the house. We decided to go this route as we have been spared of water damage up to this point. We requested that Brian do the work. Brian does excellent work. He plans things out, does not rush, keeps the house clean by using plastic around the work area, and makes sure we have use of some running water while replacing the old piping. At this time (because all the plumbing was being disconnected) we replaced a toilet  and some tub and shower valves. This was a big job and we appreciate Brian's dedication. If by chance some plumbing needs to be done in the future I will request Brain as the one to repair it.</review>

Drina was excellent tech in doing HVAC checkup. She's conscientious and relentless.

Anderson's will be returning, because they were unable to resolve one problem today. One anticipates that their depth of talent will enable them to identify the right person rapidly and be able to schedule quickly, since it's a follow-up and it's taking a good bit of extra customer time.

The one surprising thing is that Anderson is retro in their communications. They rely on telephone as if it's in the 1980s. Even when requested to use email, they use very little of it. This is a costly problem for those customers who have businesses, for example, and can readily multitask with emails, but are unable to justify the various costs imposed by unnecessary phone calls. Hopefully they'll be updating this aspect of their vital customer service focus.<//text>

Ken Slater was a very professional and friendly technician.  I was very satisfied with the timeliness, skill, knowledge and honesty he exhibited while installing our new water heater.  I would definitely use Anderson Plumbling, Heating and Air again, and recommend the company to friends.</text>

I would highly recommend Anderson to any one who needs service.  My AC was not working properly.  I called for a service appointment on a Friday, so I knew there would be something of a wait.  Wednesday Michael G. came to my house at the time I was told.  He asked me what the problem was and then he checked the equipment.  He was friendly and explained in detail what was wrong with my unit and how he was planning to fix it.  I appreciate all the info he gave me and the professional manner he used.< /review>

<review>Larry was very courteous, answered my questions and tried to trouble shoot the problem.    He was on time, respected my property.  What he did not do was remove the trap.  I did not ask him to but when he ran water and could not reproduce the back up of water in the sink, he might have thought of that.  I thought of it later the night and asked the next person who looked at the sink when it backed up again to do that.  We found a child's toothbrush which had obviously been in there for some time.  I am not faulting him but the next time I would definitely make sure the trap be removed from a sink that is backing up.

I also had Zak B. out for the same problem.  Again he ran water, tried to reproduce the blockage.  We went over everything that had been done the day before, we checked the clean out on the side of the building and then I asked him to remove the trap on the sink.  He did and we found a child's toothbrush in the trap.  Again if I had not asked to have it removed the problem would have recurred.  I am happy I asked but I think the technician should know to remove a trap if they can't reproduce the blockage with running water.  Something has to be causing the sink to backup several times.< /review>< Pictures>

-Can't say enough good things about this well run company. Anderson's is a San Diego treasure. Sounds corny but really, they are what professionalism is all about. They know their stuff and their staff is most excellent, every one. We have used them for years and just threw them probably their most challenging and frustrating job ever!  We're SO sorry. They pulled it off with efficiency and were good natured and professional all the way through to the end. We wholeheartedly recommend them!<//Review>

<Review>Called Anderson Plumbing at 8:30am, was promised a plumber would be here between noon and 4:00pm.  Ricardo and Jesse arrived at 1:30pm, about 20 minutes after a phone call from the office that they were on their way.
These guys were great.  Very professional, and, with an added benefit, fun and informative.  Had a written estimate within a few minutes of their arrival after a survey of the problem.
Job was competently completed in about an hour and the job site left perfectly clean.
Will always call Anderson to work on any of our future household plumbing issues.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</Gmap_id><Time>1449004466408< /Time><name>Robert Madruga</name>< Resp>

<review>I called Anderson to have a broken disposer replaced. Calling the job in already a great experience - ''How can I make you smile today?'' just works! Scheduling was without problems and I got called 30 minutes before the technician arrived. Justin M. impressed me right away, because he listened to my problem description, then assessed the work involved, presented me with the options available. I chose, he did the rest - a sizable job as it turned out. In-between and after having finished, he warned me that, perhaps, another unrelated problem might arise in the near future. He counseled me on the work to be done, if that were the case. Justin explained everything very well. He also asked me if there were other problems and, on me mentioning one, he took care of it. The parts that he needed were on the Anderson truck - they are fully stocked as the advertisement says. Justin left the job site clean and tidy. The part that he had mentioned might be on the brink of failure actually did fail a few hours later. I called it in, the time was set and Justin took care of the rusted out part the next day, same time. No fuzz, no huff and puff, Anderson and Justin just did it. I had used this company before, and was happy, but it has gotten even better!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The technician did a good job on explaining work and cost , and and the work execution as well. He cleaned up nicely after done. However, the price was a real shock for me. Anderson charges by job, not by hourly. The job was categorized as cat 8 of 3" cleanout. The real work was replacing a fall-off 1 foot long 3" drainage pipe connector. The entire work was done just about little over 2 hours. I was charged $1149.40. I am not sure that this is a normal charge or I was just rubbed.< /Text>

With sluggish drains, the fear of water backing up was a real threat. I was extremely happy when Dylan cleared our drains and scheduled a camera scope appointment, which was completed today by Miguel. And we are finally (literally) getting to the root of the problem -- roots in the drain line is the problem. Next step is a resolution. Everyone has been very professional. Thank you.<//review>

Ken S arrived exactly on time, wore booties in my house, explained the problem to me, and did a very professional job on repairing my toilet.  He left my bathroom as clean as it was, and told me about a coupon I could use for the service call since I am a repeat customer and happened to have one.  He was very nice and also showed me how to reconnect the chrome dishwasher vent that had become unscrewed on my kitchen counter.  It was a very good experience, and this is why I always use Anderson.</Review></record>

< Review>
With sluggish drains, the fear of water backing up was a real threat. I was extremely happy when Dylan cleared our drains and scheduled a camera scope appointment, which was completed today by Miguel. And we are finally (literally) getting to the root of the problem -- roots in the drain line is the problem. Next step is a resolution. Everyone has been very professional. Thank you.< /Review>

Rueban , the technician from Anderson Plumbing was very courteous and informative while inspecting our plumbing problems . He was courteous and his suggestions on our next step were professional and well appreciated ; I will use Anderson in the future and recommend the company to all my business friends.

Thank you

Mike B. repaired the air conditioner later the same day and it was a grand experience,  he was very knowledgable about the product and very pleasant to do business with. I highly recommend him him and Anderson P H & A.
Thank you again.

Let's get this out of the way first.  The service was just fine.  However like with all trades they have gotten out of wack with the Amount they charge you.  Knowing more people aren't going to tackle plumbing or electrical issues  doesn't give them the opportunity to gouge the customer.  All i needed was a trap under the sink replaced. 20 dollars maybe in materials.  Yet I got charged $372 for 15 min. job.   Shameful...again Anderson plumbing isn't the only one but would be nice if they stepped up to the plate and maybe be a step above the rest!<//Review>

<user_id>117266030768350052936< /user_id><text>I Have a 5 year old central AC system that kicks out cold air fine, but have had problems with occasional water dripping from above. CJ ( technician) arrived at the 1PM requested time and immediately began his diagnosis of the problem. Within 10 minutes he figured out the problem (which was two-fold) and began the fix. After a time on the roof to check out and adjust the system, be began the repair inside.
His cleaning of the main drain hose from the air exchanger and the hose below to the drain was completed successfully. All is now Good!

As a side note, I've been in business successfully for a number of years.  I was very impressed with my technician (CJ).  He is a remarkable individual on two levels.  He has extraordinary people skills combined with very strong technical ability.  That's an excellent combination that's difficult to find in employees today!<//text>< date>

< review>
They used to be my go to company great people  but recently took an estimate from them which is $6000 more than the actual work performed by another licensed plumber. Now I wonder if I went with another company last year to do my sewer lines, I could have saved at least 4000. But I learnrf  this time to get three other estimates. Sorry Anderson you have great people. But way too expensive!

UPDATE!!! Got an email today, they reviewed the quote and dropped it from $6900 to $4951 after I posted this review.  I got other estimates a lot lower for exactly same work, with liability insurance, worksmen's comp coverage and same credentials for $1786.00 .  I really like your people Anderson Plumbing, but your company charges too much.  Last year you charge me over $7000 for sewer repairs which could have only cost me $3500 according to the company I hired to do the work recently in my home.  Thank you for having great staff but your company is OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE.<//review>

A shout out to Anderson PHA, and their technician James B.  We had a plumbing back-up on Christmas morning as my luck would have it.  I called Anderson and to offset my bad luck they thankfully sent James B. to the house.  I don't have appropriate vocabulary to commend James B. His appearance, knowledge, service and professionalism was beyond my highest expectations. His respect for my property was as if it was his own home. Clean equipment and well thought out procedures had the problem solved in only minutes. Adequate equipment and solid procedures.  Thank you James B.  Anderson PHA ... you have a great employee.< /review>

Micheal informed me of everything going on with my furnace to the point that i understood what  the problem is. I plan on contacting him in January 2018, reguarding replacment of the furnace.
He was very through & well informed.< /text>

So, our central house air conditioning packed up yesterday. We were very keen to have it repaired quickly so we used homeadvisor to find local contractors. Anderson arrived about 3:10 today and prepared a quote of $1811 to replace an $18 capacitor!!!  Scandalous, egregious or what?  We found a local contractor (Air Time) shortly afterwards, they arrived within less than two hours of our first contact, repaired the system in 10 minutes, and for less than 10% of the price i.e. $180. They (Air Time) were amazing. If you care about your money, do yourself a favor and call someone else.< /text>

As no company wants to get a bad review, we do want to know about our clients experiences. I was able to pull Graham's service call and I found that we provided same day service, even though we were booked due to the number of calls coming in at this time. Our technician detected the issue with the system, and provided an upfront quote for repairs. Our technician actually did not quote $1811.00 for only a capacitor replacement, but along with 3 other repairs and our service fee. We are glad that the problem was fixed, however our recommendations did include other items that would keep the system running more effectively, not just a quick fix. If Graham would like to contact us and discuss the matter further or have a field manager out to go over the recommendations in more detail, we would be happy to schedule at his convenience.\nThank you,\nAnderson PHA\nErin Hanson, Client Care Manager\n619-449-3852 x445"}</response>< gmapID>

Let's get this out of the way first.  The service was just fine.  However like with all trades they have gotten out of wack with the Amount they charge you.  Knowing more people aren't going to tackle plumbing or electrical issues  doesn't give them the opportunity to gouge the customer.  All i needed was a trap under the sink replaced. 20 dollars maybe in materials.  Yet I got charged $372 for 15 min. job.   Shameful...again Anderson plumbing isn't the only one but would be nice if they stepped up to the plate and maybe be a step above the rest!< /Text>

<Time>1501022984115< /Time><rating>5<//rating><review>Tried Anderson Plumbing, Heating, and Air for the first time. Having only one full bath, it was a bit of an emergency when the shower wouldn't drain, and dripping faucets were rapidly filling the shower stall. Technician James, attempted to clear the blockage, but only got 2 feet into the drain. After informing him of old cast iron pipes in the crawl space beneath our house, he called a camera specialist, Ricardo, to determine the problem. We needed a new trap and 10 foot length of modern-day "code" pipe. James was able to temporarily stop the dripping faucets. Unfortunately, we weren't able to schedule the fix-up for a week later.

One week later: Larry, a very knowledgeable man with plenty of on-the-job experience, and a supervisor as well, arrived about 8:30 AM (on time), fully explained all of the work that was to be done, and answered all of our questions. Then he went right to work. The beneath the house work was accomplished pretty quickly, but the new, Moen, single handle faucet kit was a bit of a challenge. Larry had to remove an area of tile, and saw through 2-inch concrete and lathe in our "vintage" shower stall. When the job was completed (by mid-afternoon), the shower drained well (with its modern, 4 inch pipe), and we had a shiny Moen faucet/plate and shower head. They were so well-installed that one couldn't tell that they were replacements. No damage to the existing tile and well-sealed.

On the same-day that James and Ricardo came out, (at different times), I was only charged $42. Ricardo prepared the cost, with options. In my opinion, the fee for the option that I chose, was fair, considering the time, labor, and parts involved. On repair day, no attempt to oversell, no surprises. My white tiled bathroom was left clean, and undamaged. Larry even wore shoe covers to protect my dark hardwood floors and oriental rugs where he had to pass through the house.

I definitely will call Anderson again for its caring, knowledgeable, experienced, professional service for plumbing repairs on my OLD house. Thank you, James, Ricardo, and Larry.</review>< Pictures>

I had a great experience with my technician CJ and Katherine, they were very professional and super friendly. They showed me what needed to be fixed and what not and the estimate was less than the other competitors. I would call CJ and Kathrine back in a heartbeat. Great experience 100%.<//review>

Sorry for the duplicate, but I think I posted this on a site that feeds into Google.
WARNING! Outrageous prices. Confusing and complicated fee schedule with “up front pricing” (Stupid me, for not reading the reviews before calling them.) I discovered a slight leak from one of the toilet tank bolts. I checked online to see what needed to be done (remove tank & bolts, sandpaper the hole, replace). The cost of the bolt & gasket kit online, $8.55. Instead of DIY I called Anderson. I told the plumber there was a leak from the bolt…I guess he took a look at me and thought, “female, old, dumb”, or else the plumbers are pushed to upsell. He said, “oh no, it’s leaking from, etc….” I told him to put his finger on the left bolt and feel the water. I didn’t need or want anything else because I had just a few weeks previously changed out the “innards” of the tank. So he quoted me…$657.00! A rip-off. We hassled over the price (I really should have just asked him to leave). After “calling his manager”, the price was reduced because I didn’t need a “full tank rebuild”, which I never asked for. I still was overcharged. Less than an hour work, plus a $8.55 part. He tried to impress me that I was getting a 2-year warranty (on a $8.55 part).
Their fees are based on 9 levels, with a price for each individual item in each level. As an example, for the work I myself did previously: In level 2: toilet flapper, plus a tank trip lever. My cost $38.00 online, plus 5 minutes of work. Their level 2 pricing: Flapper $269; Trip lever $269 = $458. As I said…beware.< /Text>

I had a sewer issue under my 1940 craftman style house. William was arrived on time, was quick, professional, knowledgeable and personable. He quickly traced the issues and offer multiple options to address them. Had a quote for me right there and cleaned up everything he worked on afterwards. Have a drain issue? Ask for William or one of his crew.</Review>

Drina was a dream. She quickly identified problems with the original installation of our AC/Heating system and then took the extra time to correct them and get my system working properly. She stayed with me until we were both satisfied that all was ok and I had a handle on how to use the system and also how to use it wirelessly. Fantatic employee.<//review>

**RESOLVED** I called Anderson on 7/16 about my mother’s a/c since it was not functioning properly and not getting enough cold air upstairs. The person who answered said that there’s availability in the afternoon. I said Ok and said if I need to cancel, I will call because I initially wanted another company that I trust to fix the AC but they were booked all day and not sure if they could come the same day. Since Anderson charges $68 just to come I called to cancel the appointment but the person who answered said that they would not charge additional fee and it will go towards the repair. So I said ok, hoping they would be reasonable. The repair man named JUNIOR arrived and looked at the AC and took about 2 minutes and said the unit was “unfixable” and need to replace and it would cost about $10k-20k. My mother is in her old age and she wanted it to be fixed at least temporarily until she could replace it( add a coolant/ Freon) We could clearly see that he did not want to even try fixing and had a really bad attitude. then he said to do that there’s no guarantee and there can be a leak, etc, etc.. trying to sell a new one. Then he said it will cost $1850 to just add Freon to fix it temporarily or if you don’t want him to do that for that amount to pay $ 68 for coming. We’ve fixed our AC units in our homes and never paid more than $300-$400. This man was so unreasonable and cruel. He insisted that We pay him $68 for 2 minutes he took to look at it and try to scam my old aged mom. So we did pay $68 and let him go. We got the other company to come the same day and fix the AC with the coolant and charged only $300 and the AC is working fine. I am so angry that this man from this “reputable” company is scamming people trying to sell their AC units and giving unreasonable, unreal quotes so they rob money from people.

UPDATE: A few days later we contacted Anderson customer service and told them what happened, they refunded the $68. They agreed that it was unprofessional and not how they train their employees.<//text>

<Review>my appointment was between 8-12 and I received a phone call at 7:15 saying the tech would be here in an hour.  Ken S arrived exactly on time, wore booties in my house, explained the problem to me, and did a very professional job on repairing my toilet.  He left my bathroom as clean as it was, and told me about a coupon I could use for the service call since I am a repeat customer and happened to have one.  He was very nice and also showed me how to reconnect the chrome dishwasher vent that had become unscrewed on my kitchen counter.  It was a very good experience, and this is why I always use Anderson.</Review>< rate>

<Text>DO NOT USE! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOT WILLING TO HELP!

Called for bathroom double sink back up and guy shows up. He then says he forgot the main tool in Escondido. He comes back and breaks snake cable off in the drain, but the sink "Should still work." I need to pay him $142, he leaves and I check bathroom and 1 inch of nasty smelly black water is in tub, where I set all my stuff from under the counter. I had to call him back and all my stuff was dirty. He said someone needed to come out with a camera on Friday morning. So now I can't use my master bathroom at all. New guy "specialist" comes Friday morning, never gets a tool out and tells me he doesn't need to because he knows what it needs. Off his head, with no calculator, he says it will be about $2700 because they need to cut up my walls now. I tell him he needs to write up an estimate and I will get a second opinion. Writes it up for $2400 and tells me he's "Hooking me up." I let him leave and call 2nd plumber. Guy comes and says he can't do anything with Anderson's broken parts in the line. Trying to make sure so I don't get forgot about for the weekend, I leave several messages, and I FINALLY get to talk to a manager at 4:49 on Friday night. He tells me they have no liability for breaking their cable off in my line and leaving it there. He is rude an condescending - I wish I had never heard of these people and I hope to spare someone else the same hassle.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I have been waiting for 2 days for them to show up.  Numerous calls to ask when I can expect a repairman and they won't give me a time.  It is almost 5 PM, no one here.  The temperature was 47 dg this morning.  I'm cold!  I know it's a busy time of year, why else would someone be using the furnace?</Review>

{'time': 1513976040509, 'text': 'Good afternoon Ms. Cummins,\nMy name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air. I first want to thank you for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with your service. I did receive your concern from our CSR regarding we hadn\'t shown up as of 5pm last night. I was able to pull up your account and confirm via our phone recordings, that you called for service on Tuesday at 3pm, and were scheduled for service Thursday in our pm slot. Which was explained that we would arrive anytime after 12pm. You confirmed this was ok with you as we were booked at that time. I do sincerely apologize that we did not have anything sooner at that time, and that our scheduling time frames were not satisfactory. We recently changed our windows of scheduling due to our technicians were often delayed on jobs- therefore we would be late for the next clients window. We have found that giving an "am" appointment, arriving before 12pm, and a "pm" appointment arriving after 12pm enables us to not be late for appointments. We do keep our clients updated half way through the morning or afternoon, as well as call them 30-45 minutes prior to arriving. This enables our clients to go on about their day and not have to wait at home for us to arrive.\nI do see that we offered you an afterhours appointment, but that was declined due to the service fee was higher. I do wish I was made aware of this concern at that time, I would have honored our regular fee for you. We by no means want our clients sitting in a cold home waiting for service. And after listening to your explanation of the problem- I too believe it was a relatively simple fix. Also, I would like you to know that our technicians run calls 24 hours a day, and can work in the darkest of areas- Again I wish this was discussed with you before hand so maybe we could have kept your appointment last night and gotten this taken care of for you before you had to leave.\nIf  this has not been taken care of, or you have questions or further concerns- please call me directly and I will do my best to get you immediate service.\nSincerely,\nErin Hanson\nClient Care Manager\nAnderson PHA\n619-449-3852 x445\nerinh@andersonpha.com'}</response>

Thankfully we haven't had the need for a plumber often but when we do I'm glad that we found Anderson Heating, Air, and Plumbing.  Their techs are always clean and professional.  Our latest experience was actually 3 jobs for them that snowballed into another problem so while the bill was more than we expected the tech explained everything he needed to do and why and cleaned up after he was finished.  We have never had a bad experience with them but I would bet if we did they would try and make us happy.  The tech that we had today was Eric T. and he was awesome!!!  Again we've never had a bad experience with them but they can send Eric to my house every time if they want to.  Thanks<//review>

Our A/C died on July 2nd. Normally I wouldn't be in a rush to fix it but my wife was delivering our first child on July 7.  I called 3 other companies before contacting Anderson. 2 of those companies never returned my call and the third couldn't meet our schedule demand. I needed the AC fixed by July 6th.  Anderson stepped up and squeezed us in. Mike our tech was fast, professional, and knowledgeable.  Thanks for helping us being a new born back to a cool house. It would have been a nightmare otherwise.</text>

<text>Rueban , the technician from Anderson Plumbing was very courteous and informative while inspecting our plumbing problems . He was courteous and his suggestions on our next step were professional and well appreciated ; I will use Anderson in the future and recommend the company to all my business friends.

Thank you

Mike B. repaired the air conditioner later the same day and it was a grand experience,  he was very knowledgable about the product and very pleasant to do business with. I highly recommend him him and Anderson P H & A.

I Have a 5 year old central AC system that kicks out cold air fine, but have had problems with occasional water dripping from above. CJ ( technician) arrived at the 1PM requested time and immediately began his diagnosis of the problem. Within 10 minutes he figured out the problem (which was two-fold) and began the fix. After a time on the roof to check out and adjust the system, be began the repair inside.
His cleaning of the main drain hose from the air exchanger and the hose below to the drain was completed successfully. All is now Good!

As a side note, I've been in business successfully for a number of years.  I was very impressed with my technician (CJ).  He is a remarkable individual on two levels.  He has extraordinary people skills combined with very strong technical ability.  That's an excellent combination that's difficult to find in employees today!<//text>

Unfortunately , my experience was not the same as others. When the tech came out , he gave my wife three options varying in price from $3640 for refrigerant test and repair  to replacement of system for $12.087.00. A suction line they were asking $394.00 for has a cost of approximately $35.00. Further he told me and written on his proposal that the compressor was not working and needed to be replaced.

As it turned out, I did not need a compressor and our freon leak was repaired. ALL for a TOTAL of $701.00. !!!!!!<//Review>

< Review>
Starting this review and will make sure to update it upon service completion.  I was truly amazed by the level of customer service I received when calling in to inquire about service for the drain line of our air unit.  The previous company was not responsive and could not answer my questions when I called, but wanted to schedule me three weeks in the future and mentioned they couldn't tell me what the problem was until they got a technician to the property.  They told me they would have a technician call me back and .....NO CALL BACK.  Within minutes of asking the same questions to Anderson, they got Robert on the phone with me.  He was able to explain the issue we were having based on the information I gave them, and they were able to get me in their schedule within a couple business days.  Great job thus far Anderson!  In a day and age of instant gratification you all should pat each other on the back for having an outstanding customer on-boarding process in place.  More to come after the service visit on Monday!< /Review>

<user_name>Richard Roque<//user_name><Time>1530898043599< /Time><rate>1</rate><review>I sign up for VIP membership September 2017 and yesterday I had an emergency sewer back up problem. I called the Anderson plumbing and the lady O talked to could not even tell me a timeline when can a technician can call me beck to determine the timeline they can come over to fix my sewage back up problem. Finally one hour plus the technician called me and stated that they could not respond until 3 hours later around 5:30 PM- I said ok because it's fourth of July- but when I tried calling another plumbing company (Roto-Rooter) they were consistent with the timeline- even the representative told me that the technician will call me in 15 minutes they the technician show up in my front door and able to clear my mainline sewage by accessing my clean out in less than an hour. I called again for the Anderson plumbing to come in just to place a camera and do a Plumbers Report- at first the guy told me it's $270 and when I told him I want a report to show to the city the price went up to $490 and the first available is not until three weeks later 24July2018. What a waste of VIP membership. This place sucks with all the good reviews above failed to response when I needed the most. This should say a lot when you have to chose your next plumbing project or problems.

Richard Roque<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1530905589998, 'text': '***RESOLVED*** We were able to provide Mr. Roque with the necessary information for him to contact the city regarding his issue. Thank you Mr. Roque for working with me to get this taken care of for you. We hope that your situation gets handled, please let us know if there is anything further you need.\n\nThank you Mr. Roque for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with your call out to us. My name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson PHA. I was able to pull up your account and research the details. First I would like to apologize that we were not able to get out to you sooner, we were very busy due to the Holiday, and we sincerely apologize that you had to call another company out. We are very glad I was an easy clearing for you. Our intentions are to be able to get to every client that needs us, unfortunately that isn\'t the case always.\nI also was able to get information on the estimate given for the camera and report requested. Our normal camera charge is $250.00, and an additional fee to place findings on a flash drive for your records. However, when a client needs a "Plumbers Report" there is more to just the camera-ing of the line. Because the city will not take the report from a homeowner, only a licensed plumber- our technicians have to camera the line, place the findings on a disc, write up an official findings report, take these to the city and file the report along with their form- this is why the price increased. I was also informed that the city will not do anything regarding roots in the line, corrosion or build up. There has to actually be a break, or collapse in the line for them to come out and repair/replace. If the line is able to be hydro-jetted to clear out roots or buildup- they will expect the homeowner to take care of this at their expense. I hope this gives a little more insight to your concern. I know it doesn\'t help that we were not available sooner to come out, please call me directly if you have another issue and I will work directly with a technician for you.\n\nSincerely,\nErin Hanson\nClient Care Manager\n619-449-3852\nAnderson PHA\nerinh@andersonpha.com'}< /response>< gmap_id>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Yes, I was "wowed"!  I was expecting 65 guests to my home last Saturday and that morning, the handle on a toilet broke.  I called Anderson PHA and they sent out a technician with just a few hours.  At first Ken thought he might need to order the part, but was able to find just the right one on his truck and repaired the toilet. very quickly.

Thank you Anderson PHA!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Very happy with my furnace and AC system including a new state of the art thermostat!  John Baer did a 5 star job listening to my concerns and was patient with my tenacity to ensure certain issues were resolved.
Areas that could be improved:

1.  Electronic contract administration.  i.e. could not open email to print/save contract which we changed a few times and called twice for a final copy which I still haven't received.

2.  Training on new products.  i.e. a snag installing the new thermostat which didn't get resolved until the next day, but they did resolve the issue professionally and was diligent in training the customer and ensuring the software was functioning on my cell phone.

3.  Patchwork to drywall.  i.e. we relocated the thermostat and the hole from existing location was poorly done.

These are easy things for the company to fine tune in their administration/installation process.< /Review>

Anderson PHA made a same day appointment with a two hour window, called when technician was on his way.  Ryan showed up quickly and was very professional.  He assessed the problem, treated it, tested the treatment, and explained the problem to me.  He was courteous and friendly.  I would Anderson PHA again.</Review>

Excellent, knowlegeable and professional work repairing 2 leaks in my very old, very difficult high-tank toilet. Reggie needed to visit 5 different plumbing supply outlets to find the spud and washers needed and, in the end, worked hard to successfully repair the leaks. The only problem was an unexpected flood of tank water after he had picked up the old towels we laid down so that I had to rush to use my good towels to mop up the flood onto the hardwood floors just outside the bathroom. No permanent harm done. He did a nice job and cleaned up afterward. HIGH recommendations to Reggie and to Anderson PHA. They have previously installed a water heater and a kitchen sink faucet with similar excellence and professionalism.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The purpose of this letter is to commend the Anderson Plumbing and Support Team for the Team’s superb performance and assistance.

On “day one”, I submitted an email request to the Anderson website for a replacement of toilets in two bathrooms and a repair to an additional bathroom toilet. I received a courteous call from the Anderson Team and arranged an Anderson “on site” visit on “day two” at 8AM.

On “day two”, a few minutes before 8AM, I looked out and saw an Anderson Truck parked at the curb. Anderson’s Plumbing Service Technician, Jesse Salcido, arrived at the door exactly at 8AM. He was ready in every respect to discuss our needs and his recommendations for the replacement of the two toilets as well as the repair of a third toilet. My wife and I agreed with Jesse’s proposals. Jesse was prepared to head out and pick up the new toilets and materials and return the same day to install the toilets or to return the next day after picking up replacement toilets to do the installation work. My wife and I decided it would work best for our schedule to have the work done the next day on “day three” beginning at 9AM.

On “day three” Jesse arrived on time and completed the following efforts:
a)	Replaced both angle stops for hallway bath toilet and master bathroom toilet.
b)	Removed old toilets in both bathrooms, installed new wax ring and bolts and replaced both toilets with new Toto Drake 2 ADA
c)	Rebuilt guest bathroom toilet with new flapper and replaced toilet seat
d)	Also installed a 4” clean out cap in front yard.
Jesse worked “non-stop” and completed all the jobs listed above in less three hours. (Thinking back, I believe it was closer to two and one-half hours.)
Jesse is a professional in the finest sense of the word. He represents the “best of the best”. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and an outstanding representative of the Anderson Plumbing teams that serve all over the San Diego area.
The entire Anderson experience was a very positive experience beginning with the courteous office staff members, Brittany and Kimberly who provided a telephone response my calls confirming work dates. In  addition, I want to commend  Stephanie P  and Devin C. for the way they processed the billing for the work. One word describes Anderson Plumbing –
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Very respectfully,  Dennis<//Text></record>

<Gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015<//Gmap_id><text>We had a blocked toilet that we couldn't fix with a plunger or a toilet auger from Home Depot.  Turns out that a piece of plastic wrap from some cold medication fell into the toilet, and though liquids could get by, it blocked all the other fun stuff that goes down that way.  Anyway, everything turned out well.  Mitch had to remove the toilet for this, and then put it back with a new wax ring.  Not sure if this is too much information, but Anderson Plumbing wants us to review them, so here's our review.  I called them this morning, and they sent someone out early in the afternoon.  It cost us $454 for this service, including the VIP discount we had paid when they installed a new hot water heater for us.</text><Time>1396041684518<//Time><Resp>None</Resp>< Pictures>

We set up an appointment for Anderson Heating and Air to come out to fix a leak we had coming from the overflow pvc pipes on our system.  All the service people were extremely courteous and helpful.  When the technician evaluated the issue and removed the pipes to determine the problem he gave us an estimate of $1000 to replace the pvc pipes and install a valve.  We were appalled.  He was able to get us a price of $800 which was still too high.  Since he had already removed the pipe we agreed to pay the lower cost but shared our dissatisfaction and the fact that we will never use their services again.  The cost was outrageous.  This was our first and last experience with them.</text>

<text>Jerrad H is awesome! My air conditioner and heating unit had an issue and it took several weeks and multiple trips to resolve it to due specific parts being needed.

Jerrad was very professional and showed up on time every time to continue working on it until it was resolved. He continually checked in to let us know what the status was and what needed to happen next.

Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air is lucky to have him as part of their team as he is a great representation of their company. Kind, helpful and they always follow up on what they say they will.

Called Anderson because one of my neighbors recommended them and couldn’t have been more disappointed. Bernard showed up and was very nice but tried to gauge me on price. I hit my water line in my yard while I was digging and needed a small piece of copper pipe coupled. I already had the pipe dig out so all he needed to do was cut the pipe and install the coupler. He even admitted that the job would take 30-45 minutes but once he input everything into his iPad he wanted to charge me $650!  I know a Saturday call may cost a little more but it was only 3pm and for less than an hour of work and maybe $50 in parts this seems like trying to gauge someone who you know doesn’t have water right now. I told him no and he preceded to charge me $99 just to come to my home.  So if you don’t agree to their way inflated price you still get charged.

I just called a local plumber in the neighborhood and he finished the work in 30 mins and only charged $300. He was gonna charge less but I insisted on giving him that much after my experience with Anderson. Make sure you shop around before using these guys. They try to take advantage of you when you are in a tough spot without water service.</text>

<review>In my 50+ years of owning and maintaining a home, I must say that the service provided by Larry Fawcett of Anderson Plumbing was outstanding.  He patiently explained what caused the huge leak under my sink.  Both the washing machine and the sink are connected to the same cast-iron pipe.  When the pipe becomes narrowed from lint and debris, the water backs up and floods under my sink.  Quickly and efficiently, he reamed out the pipe and meticulously cleaned up after he finished.  He pointed out a potential problem and suggested a solution to avoid another leak.  I am very impressed with the efficiency, patience, and professionalism exhibited by Mr. Fawcett.< /review>< Pictures>

Excellent!  I had talked to several plumbers previously and none were interested or able to help me.  Ken was able to help me with several issues the same day that I called and for a reasonable price!! I will refer them to anyone needing a plumber.<//Text>

<Text>Mike Gaskill did an outstanding job fixing our air conditioning unit!  The previous technician (from a different company) had not been able to fix the problem.  In addition, Mike brought us with him and explained the diagnostic and repair process step by step.  We learned lots of useful information about air conditioning!  He helped us understand what our future options were and gave us useful facts to consider as we decide whether to continue maintaining our current system or to purchase a new one.  He signed us up for a very valuable maintenance plan and gave us his cell number if we ever have any questions.  I would recommend Mike Gaskill's service to anyone!  Outstanding experience!!<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp><Date>1503860235232<//Date><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015<//GmapID></record>

John Baer walk me through from start to finish with no pressure.  He took his time explaining every facet of the contract very professionally.  I've acquired other quotations for HVAC installation and by far no one did as professional and easy to understood as John.  He does listen to his client's need and make smart project proposal.  Anderson PHA must be so blessed to have you as their Project Manager.  I will highly recommend your company to friends who will experience our new HVAC system.  Thank you very much John for  a job well done!< /Text>

Ryan came over and took care of a cranky upstairs bathroom drain problem. This is a forty old house and can be tricky to work on problems. He did a great job. I like the boot covers to keep my tile and wood floors clean. I highly recommed the company. RJC (ex-contractor)</Review>< resp>

Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air we have used on numerous occasions. Dave Grollman arrived (on schedule) and assessed the possible water leak. He was very professional and came to the conclusion that there was no leak, just a bad drywall patch. He could have taken me down a far more expensive road but he investigated all options, suggested the repair and even adjusted the low water temp in one of the baths. Thanks Dave and Anderson PHA. Will be calling you soon for an A/C tune-up.

<Review>I did not have a good experience with this company. I had them out to move a gas line and repair a leak coming from one of the fixtures in the upstairs bathtub. I usually try and stay home when people are working on the house for supervision and to answer questions, but this time I couldn't. Upon arriving home after work I found a 1 ft by 2 ft hole in the bathroom ceiling that was in the room adjacent to where the gas line was being moved and I received a message saying that I could not use my bathroom shower as the pipe below had been cracked. I do realize things happen on a jobsite, but this was a bit ridiculous. And to top it off, when I reached out to the plumber for clarification, he stated it was my fault and that I would have to pay to get everything fixed. He said he would "work with me" on the price but that he is "covered and took pictures." Being in the medical field, I liken this to a surgeon repairing a ACL, but in the meantime cutting the MCL. Apparently the gas line had fallen when he cut it which caused the hole in the spare bathroom ceiling and when he was unscrewing the drain plug, he broke the pipe below. After much argument, the plumber did agree to fix the pipe that was broke but I had to supply all of the parts and the hole in the ceiling I would have to fix. Overall, if you want your house to be in worse shape after you pay $1500, call this company.

After my review for this company I noticed that they had responded with a "we do not have you in our records, please call this number." I proceeded to call this number and express my concerns with their work. After leaving a message and waiting 2 weeks, I have now determined this must be an automated message by the company and this "we do not have your records on file" is a way to make them look like they care. Bad all around!!!< /Review>< pictures>

Anderson replaced our water heater and they did an excellent job.  The technician (Ken) was professional and courteous, and he arrived early.  It was a difficult job, because our old water heater was rusted and heavy from years of hard water build-up, but the work was completed in a timely and efficient manner.  I'm not sure how their rates compare to other companies, but the price seemed appropriate for the amount of labor involved.<//Review>

Doing DIYs'  is really satisfying if you   get your home fixes done and actually works, but this time I got frustrated because  even how hard I tried using my rigid motorized drain cleaner I failed this one . I also checked every online recommendations on how to unclogg a bathtub drain. Giving up  is not an option, but that was I just did. Get professional help my wife told me, you can't  fix everything. So we called Anderson plumbing and they sent a young technician by the name of Daylan David, who is professional in every way, he checked  the bathtub , kitchen and bathroom sink to know  what is going on. This time I asked him, if you will do it now how much time are you willing  to spend on this one .........he said an hour, with his pro snake, rags and tools.He  started his snake and in maybe less than fifteen minutes he made the bathtub drain worked again . Thank you LORD for leading us to Anderson PLUMBING and the young technician named DAYLAN DAVID for an outstanding job you guys did for us, we got our shower back.< /Text>

<text>Anderson replaced our water heater and they did an excellent job.  The technician (Ken) was professional and courteous, and he arrived early.  It was a difficult job, because our old water heater was rusted and heavy from years of hard water build-up, but the work was completed in a timely and efficient manner.  I'm not sure how their rates compare to other companies, but the price seemed appropriate for the amount of labor involved.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Many thanks to CJ Barber and Jeff!!!!  These gentlemen were absolutely amazing from the moment they arrived!  They accessed the situation and found the issue right away.  As they worked on the leak, they looked further into the entire scope of things and made the appropriate repairs while having a smile on their faces and explaining in depth the problem and how they will proceed with the repairs. (in the past we had another company come out and they did not do any of this.  Hence, why we found Anderson to come out)  CJ also suggested an Air Scrubber for a cleaner environment in our home, so we purchased one and we are super happy with it!  Our AC is working the best it has ever worked...Thanks again to CJ and Jeff, you guys should be proud of your awesome work!  I will definitely recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air!!!

<Review>I was introduced to Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air through a Groupon.  It is always a little nerve-racking using a company for the first time but it turned out there was nothing to be nervous about.  On the first visit, Service Specialist Jerrard, clearly explained the issues with my air conditioner and options for repairs.  The follow-up visit went smoothly as well.  Repairs needed were reviewed and when complete, Jerrard walked me through what was done and shared the recommended service schedule for regular maintenance.  All in all, very good experience.  Based on my experience, I highly recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.</Review><gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</gmap_id>< rating>

< Review>
This was my second experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  I was having issues with my upstairs bathroom sinks not draining.  I tried to fix it myself, but to no avail.  I decided to call Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air because my previous experience with them was an excellent one.  I called a little later in the evening and was pleasantly surprised  that someone was there to take my call.  I was greeted with a warm, "Thank you for calling Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air, how can I make you smile today?!"  What a nice way to greet your customers!  Right away, you know that you are going to be taken care of.  I was easily able to schedule an appointment.  The first appointment offered was on a Sunday.  That is so great that they could send someone over the weekend.  I knew I wasn't going to be home on Sunday so I made the appointment for the early 8-12pm window on Monday.  Usually when a company gives you a window of time, you can usually count on them coming at the end of the time, if not much later.  This is really inconvenient when you have to take half a day off of work just to wait for a technician.  Not the case with Anderson.  I got a call at 8am saying that the tech would arrive by 9am.  And he arrived by 9am!  Larry introduced himself, shook my hand, and asked for permission to enter my house.  Before he entered, he put on his booties without being asked.  After I explained my plumbing issue to him, he clearly explained what actions he needed to do and explained in detail what the cost was going to be.  I asked Larry if he would mind if I watched so I can learn how to fix a clog in the future.  He said, "Sure" and proceeded to educate me and explain step by step what he was doing and why and how the plumbing worked.  He was happy to do it and appeared genuinely proud of the work he was doing.  Many techs want to be left alone and don't want to be bothered.  Turned out that my drain issue was a bit complex.  Larry used his industrial auger, which put my 20 ft hand auger to shame.  When that did not work, be broke out the beast auger and that fixed the issue.  Despite having to go back and forth to the van to get supplies, despite having to go up and down and stairs, inside and outside the house, Larry stayed calm and collected, didn't mind removing and putting back on his booties.  When he finished his work upstairs, he cleaned up the entirety of his work area and then some.  He sprayed down the counters and glass with cleaner and he made sure he left the bathroom area nicer than when he arrived.  He even thanked me for my help, even though I was there observing to learn from him.  Larry recapped everything that he did, explained the warranty of his work, and made some recommendations without being one bit pushy or salesy.  I was so impressed by Larry's work ethic, professionalism, integrity, and passion for his craft.  Coincidentally, that day was "National Hug a Plumber Day".  To show my appreciation, I offered Larry a tip so that he can buy lunch or whatever.  He graciously said, "No thank you, it was my pleasure to serve you, use that to take your kids out to lunch."  What a great guy!

The next day, based on Larry's recommendation, William came over with his nifty video device.  In order to make sure that there were no other issues with my pipes, William fished his video camera down into my pipes.  We were able to clearly see inside the pipes, maybe 20 feet or so.  This was displayed on the video monitor.  When he was done, William said everything looked good, there was no additional blockage.  He recommended hydrojetting (washing) of the pipes, but at this point it was not an emergency, but should be done at some point in order to avoid future clogs.  I appreciated his honesty when he could have easily tried to upsell me.

This is a testament to what a great company Anderson is.  Built upon family values, they really take the time and effort to show that they care and appreciate their customers.  If you have any plumbing, heating or air issues, I recommend Anderson without reservation!< /Review>

I have signed up for the annual service program in great part to these 2 young men.

I had to have a complete repipe of my entire house done. Bernard and Enrique did a fantastic job!  I couldn't be happier. Bernard did the repipe and figured out the least invasive way to reroute everything. I do have to admit I was a little nervous after seeing all the walls and cieling drywall cut out of all the different rooms, but Enrique was an artist with the new drywall and you literally cannot tell anything was done. The drywall, paint and texture match perfectly.I would defintely recommend Anderson Plumbing based on the quality work that Bernard and Enrique performed. They were on time, no surprises, very professional. Anderson also provided a 20 year warranty. They really did WOW me !< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>This is my 5th or 6th review.  I've been with Anderson's for more than a decade now.  Love those folks!  They're friendly and professional.  They contact me proactively for various service and maintenance on my systems.  They NEVER try to oversell me!  Their prices are very fair and reasonable for high quality items and even higher quality service. I get a follow up phone call after every visit.  I am a committed customer and will remain so.  If you want the best HVAC/Plumbing vendor, contact Anderson's!

6.1.18. Just wanted to add another comment about the GREAT service yesterday by Kevin and Aries for my annual A/C maintenance checkup.  As always with Anderson associates, these men were a delight to deal with.  Thank you, Gentlemen!

6.17.18.  Justin is another example of Anderson's commitment to customer service.  He came out at 0800 hrs on Father's Day for an water heater that went bad and spent all day, and I mean ALL day, replacing it with a new tankless water heater.  Great sense of humor to boot.  He's the latest in a long line of Anderson professionals who've worked with me and he was SUPERB!  I recommend him to you.  Believe me, you will be doing yourself a HUGE favor!< /review>< pictures>

I needed some minor plumbing/fixture work done on my home to get it ready for a home inspection.  My typical plumber did not have availability within the time frame.  I remembered the AWSOME trucks I had seen around, and being a professional female myself, I thought I'd give them a try. Calling and scheduling the appointment was great--super professional without a long wait for service. The service charge was extremely reasonable as well. The guy arrived on time and was really nice.
Before entering the house, I showed him a water spicket that had a stripped handle on it. He said he would look at it before he left but it would be expensive (odd  I thought). One of the jobs was to have a "sticky" diverter (from bath to shower) loosened because it was gritty and difficult to manipulate.   No parts, not major work.  Problem:  the quote to have that done was $550!  Really.  $550.    I declined and showed him another bath tub  where the water stopper was not attached to the Kohler lever so the water would not drain.  He did not know how to fix the Kohler but suggested a toe tap drain.   This, I had to do because I needed it for an inspection. The charge: $330.  Really.  It took him 5 minutes.
He overheard me on the phone telling my real estate agent that the charge was too expensive and he apologized  stating that he didn't set the prices, he only enforced them.

After he left, I got a squirt bottle with vinegar and soaked and manipulated the gritty diverter.  Works just fine.  Really, Really disappointed.< /review>

<Text>CJB came out to install & explain the "Air Scrubber Plus." I was absulutely sold!! Its only been under an hour since he and Nate left, and I CAN BREATHE!!! I am so glad that CJ took the time to explain how the Air Scrubber works. I am having Respiratory/Allergy issues which my Doctor has been dealing with. I thought I  would have to buy 3 Air Purifiers to be able to deal with breathing. I called Anderson, who I have always relied on to take care of my Plumbing & Air, and out came CJ & Nate to solve my problems. I have had a Contract with Anderson since 2007 and I have never been unsatisfied. All the way from Troung Le who made my appointment & wrote down details of my problems but also called back to tell me that he took care to write down for the technician, CJ, all that he may need to help me. I have had CJ take care of me before so I was so happy to see him pull up to my house... I felt so comfortable. I also must say everyone that has come to my house over all these years has given exceptional service. CJ also has that ability to make a customer feel "taken care of" in a special way. He is also a great mentor to those he is training. Nate is new but I can tell you that he will be yet another great addition to the company. In conclusion, thank you Anderson!!!!</Text>< date>

<GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</GmapID><review>Russel and John got tasked to correct a difficult Return Air ducting issue with a new install of a Lennox 4 ton HVAC unit in an older existing structure. The original Return ducting consisted of a single 12" round duct. The unit needed at least 1500 cfm, when it only had 600 cfm. I thought we could get another through the lower story into the mechanical room, but only a 6" was able to be installed due to framing and other mechanical systems interference. The solution,  since I did not want the exterior of the structure opened up, was to have the service tech, Russel, crawl up through a small opening in the ceiling of the outside mechanical room; upwards through a 2 story chase, in order to remove the existing 12" and cut in another 12' round to double that capacity. Both Russel and John never hesitated when evaluating the job. They jumped right in, finished in a remarkably short time, made the connections in extremely tight areas, worked cleanly and neatly. The A/C unit now produces the full 4 ton capacity with no problem. Kudos to these guys for their work and extremely positive attitudes, and know how; to be able to get a difficult remodel situation solved.
Thanks Guys.</review><Time>1457905270398<//Time>< Rating>

A very rewarding experience dealing with CJ, an Anderson hvac tech. Came on time, NO high pressure upsells,and very knowledgeable in his craft. He gave us good recommendations for improvements to our system in a DIY format.. We rec'd all this for just the price of the furnace tune-up special.  In this instance Mary Jean was right, her team and CJ wowed us ...  I will definitely ask for CJ again!< /Review>

<Text>I contacted SDG& E about a gas smell in my foyer.  They came out and found no gas readings in the home yet checked out the system and found it was changing pressure enough to warrant a complete gas turnoff and lock.  That was on June 2nd.  That same evening I contacted Anderson Plumbing on the web and was contacted that same evening to schedule a technician to come out.

Chris B was very professional.  He and his associate went through the system thoroughly and methodically assessing the situation.  Unfortunately, with this older structure finding the problem was difficult.  But through a process of elimination, Chris was able to narrow it down to an single location and had a theory on the possible issue.  He then proceeded to let me know of the delay in completion do to the fact that he wanted to be sure and not demo my home any more by using a helium test to pinpoint the problem.

The next day the problem area was found and the repairs were down quickly.  Unable to get the County to move faster they were not able to come out on Friday to sign off on this.  The whole weekend was a "no Hot Water"  weekend.

On Monday we got the County Inspector(if you can call him that.)  He immediately treated you staff as if they we amature Craigslist Handymen.  Telling them they did the repair all wrong and used the wrong hardware and proceeded in accusing Chris of not being "qualified"  to do the work because he didn't have a certification card.  He even said this work wasn't finished,  made them change a flex line in the furnace to a hard line( not why he was here by the way) and walked out as Chris tried to explain to him where was mistaken and that he is a professional at his work.  Chris was then, after at least 15 minutes convinced the inspector that he was right.  The inspector basic conditionally approved the turn-on.  And wanted Chris to return to shut off everything later this week so he can come back out and inspect the fixes himself and the pressure reading as well.  Preposterous Crap!

Well Chris got the job done and he and his associate(sorry I for got his name) was supurb, and after six days my wife can now washer her hair.  That's all that matters.

Thanks Chris
Thanks Anderson.

<text>So my air conditioner stopped putting out cold air, at least so I thought when it wouldn't cool my house in 30 minutes on a hot, hot, humid day. I called Anderson plumbing for no other reason than I like their television commercials (especially Mary Jean), and boy was I pleasantly surprised by the service call I received. The technician, Jerrad Hortum, was extremely polite (yes, he wore shoe covers in my home), knowledgable, articulate, and competent. He diagnosed my AC condenser issues in about 20 minutes and he gave me several repair options to consider. While I know it's one of their sales slogan, Jerrad did NOT pressure me in the slightest to make an immediate decision. For that reason alone, I will absolutely call and use Anderson plumbing for my future plumbing and AC needs. (And I sure hope I get Jerrad again. He really was FANTASTIC!)< /text><Name>Mark Stell< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Anderson Plumbing came out to fix leaking toilet tanks in my condo. Brian wasn't happy with how the new parts were functioning so he took the extra time to perform a leak test and he re-replaced the parts. Thanks Brian!< /Review>

The clients water heater is still under warranty and they have requested the parts from the manufacturer. We have suggested that the clients go through the warranty company as this will be the best way to get the water heater up to code and not cost them anything in the long run.\nWe appreciate them giving us another chance to make the situation right, and do wish them all the best. We will continue to be of service as needed.\nSincerely, Anderson PHA\n\nWe thank you Mr. Gitesatani for your review. My name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson PHA. I have left you a voicemail and spoken to Mrs. Gitesatani as well.  We are extremely apologetic for the way the service call was handled and would like to speak to you as soon as it is convenient for you. I have given your wife my cell & desk number in hopes to hear from you this evening and get a supervisor out to get you hot water asap. It is never our intention to leave a home with no hot water, or upset our clients as we have you. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you very much, Erin Hanson 619-449-3852'}</resp>
