<Date>1616468399351</Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>ordered through app for takeout today I ordered my food and they missed one of my item from the plate (sesame chicken) so I found this missing item after I got home. I called the store and they didn't bother to deliver the missing item. I had to driver again and get my missing item. I talked to the manager and their attitude was very rude. also when I wss in the store, I asked for the money back for the missing item and they said it is not possible which seem like she was lying.. Also when I complained for my lost time and gas for driving to the store, the manager didn't even say sorry but raised her shoulder and gave me gesture like "so what" this happened before when I ordered through the app and had missing item. I'm truly disappointed large franchise like panda express is so unprofessional. I'm not going back to this store again, and rethinking about dining from Panda express.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxPRwgYaS-OUssC2xzQgs_jU2PLYcSzzyVcZQg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

This location never gives enough food. I walk away irritated that I came here. It always depends on who is working but I think it’s the boss that is skimpy on the portions. I ordered a bowl that wasn’t even full. Other locations are better.<//Review>

<review>They take your orders and then say it back to you!!!
So how come you get something different when you get your food????
It's on the Grill tickets what you ask (payed) for!!!
So why ,  the food we got was ok, but not what we ordered, no more going to this location!!!!  Good luck if you do!?!?!</review>< Pics>

<Review>They keep things pretty fresh.  Sometimes you have to wait for a fresh item.  The veggies are too crunchy for me, but every thing else is tasty.  They try to keep it clean, but have a hard time during the rush hour.  Bonus is they show games on the ESPN channel ( no volume)< /Review>< pics>

<Text>The Chinese lady who works there (looks like the boss) never gives a good amount of food. She bats a bad eye when you ask for more when you’re paying for the food. It’s actually hilarious and it takes multiple requests for her to fulfill what the customer needs such as having to ask twice for hot sauce. Terrible customer service here.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Nice and clean all around. Very friendly staff who are always keeping the restaurant picked up. I ate here at 1350 on a Wednesday and there was no line and seating was wide open. Food was still fresh. This is in a nice shopping area too. Prices and portions are inline with all other Panda Express locations. They also have an out door area to eat. I can picture parking being a challenge on the weekends.<//Review>

<Text>Make sure to CHECK YOUR ORDER! The lady manager first off gave us VERY small portions, and then tried to jip us out of our fried rice that we were waiting for!!! The customers in front of us were missing eggrolls from their order! The customers behind us were having a hard time ordering from her as well. It's a darn shame because this used to be a REALLY good Panda Express.< /Text>< user_id>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>They are hungrier for my money than I am for their food. Portions are getting smaller and smaller, they watch carefully that you do not get a single more grain of rice than you should.
Soon they might just draw the food on your plate.
They don't point you to napkins and other disposables, no offering of sauce or anything else except they keep asking about up selling.
All these panda express places make it very very obvious that they just want your money and give you as little as it is legally possible.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd2a4efac9ad57:0xf5491fd8219fb267<//gmap_id></record>

It’s been a while since I’ve been to this location, until today. I noticed that the portions aren’t anywhere near what they used to be. It  seems unfair for the price i paid. I find myself having to get the “bigger plate” just to get the equivalent entree portion of the regular plate! I’ll make the extra drive to the location off of Beach Blvd and Imperial HWY from now on because the portions are at least FAIR. I understand that management is worried about maximizing their profits and making their numbers look good, however, this is NOT the way to go about it. WE DO NOT appreciate being ripped off like this! You are stealing from the consumers at this location!<//Review>

[5-STAR RECOMMENDATION] This Panda Express Chinese restaurant is located on West Malvern Avenue in the city of Fullerton, California. It is located near the Barnes and Noble bookstore. My favorite entree is the orange chicken! It is absolutely delicious. The customer service associates are friendly and nice!</review>

TERRIBLE PLACE TO EAT, no wonder it has poor reviews and ratings...... employees there repeat the same sentence over and over again like a robot and pushing customers to choose as fast as they can and yet they ask the same thing twice what I just ordered because they are not listening by saying the same thing over and over again, you will hear them saying the same thing not even 10 seconds after they said the last word.
Customers feel like being forced to choose the menu and go away.
This is ridiculous food business practice and I will never go there again!< /Text>

I am not at all sure what these bad reviews are about. I have been to this Panda countless times since they opened and the one thing that stands out above all IS the excellent service. The employees are friendly, professional and always, always polite to a fault. As far as the food goes, hey it's Chinese fast food cooked without MSG. It's fine for what it is, not earth-shatteringly delicious, but fine and it's nice to have the no MSG option. Take heart, Panda, your loyal customer base is always here for you.< /Text>

This place is pretty good. But if you want to go to a real Chinese cuisine version with way better quality food go to this place i love it.
Its about the same price with better food.

I am always greeted friendly.
I am always asked for a sample.
I am always getting my favorite sauce with the noodles.
Friendly customer service and the food has good and better
Variety than other places.<//Text>

Quick service, friendly staff, and they always manage to get a donation out of me (their secret? asking if you would simply like to round out your total to the nearest dollar - works every time)!</Review>

<Text>Serving size is always smaller than most of Panda Express and unfriendly staffs. Chow mein noodles taste burnt sometimes and fried rice doesn't taste good. It's in a good location but their overall service is not good compared to most of the Panda Express.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x80dd2a4efac9ad57:0xf5491fd8219fb267</GmapID>< user_id>

<Text>Bland and boring. Too many nearly raw onions are used as cheap filler. Rice also dominates. Counter help sounds like robots. Pokibowls are better tasting, healthier, and more reasonably priced.< /Text>< Resp>

Honestly this is one of the infamous locations for their small portions even in comparison to other Panda Express locations.  If I didn't live here I would probably never go.  Even so I usually go to the other locations if I have the time to do so.<//Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Can hardly give a 3 star. Tonight 10-14-17, the food was not good at all. I have been coning here for years and the food has always been good. If not for their past history, I would have rated them 2 stars. Rice was pasty, chow mein was old and dry, way too much undercooked cabbage. Orange chicken and kung pow chicken did not taste the same and were hard to eat. Very sad, as this place has always been great. I will try it one more time to see if tonight is an exception, I hope it was.< /Text><response>None<//response><Rating>3< /Rating>< user_id>

The Bigger Plate is charged as a Big Plate ($7.40)+ extra entree ($1.50), making the receipt look like a bunch of Chinese writting, perplexing to figure out. Panda Express does not make it simple to understand their charges, only to confuse their customers with "other" charges and scoot right along the animal feed line to pay your due.
Worker and management are really not interested or concerned with your grievance. They want to push the line of other willing paying zombies than to deal with the one concerned customer complaint. TERRIBLE customer service! They do welcome you as you come in though.
Food is okay. For fast and outside the norm, it's a change from the yellow and red restaurant motif.< /text>

<Text>de Young Cafè in the Golden Gate Park was one of the stops of our city bus tour. It's a nice enough place, nothing spectacular. We paid $20 for a pre-packaged turkey sandwich, which I shared with my husband and a cup of orange juice. Very overpriced. You'd be better off eating from one of several food trucks across the street.< /Text>< time>

<Text>Nice cafe with a view, indoor and outdoor door seating, plenty of wait staff and free refill for tea! Good range of salads, sandwiches, hour and cold drinks. And if you want just a hard boiled egg, you can find it here too. Sure the prices are steep here, but which museum with captive audience don't do that? So if you want to economise, being a packed lunch to have on the beautiful lawns and seats then come in here for refillable teas.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80858099be62b323:0xd77fbc61bfe19462< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Attentive staff gets you though the line quickly so don't be discouraged by the long lines.  There is outdoor seating in the sculpture patio or you can dine inside too.  When there is a busy show at the Museum, they set up extra tents during inclement weather to provide extra seating.  The seasonal menu changes regularly, and they offer quick grab and go foods in their refrigerator case. Good for kids and grandparents alike!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>This place should have 5 stars all the way. Good food, very pleasant staff, fantastic atmosphere, what else can you want. I think a lot of folks think that leaving 3 stars is a good review... no its not! If you leave 3 stars it means there is something wrong with the place. (sorry for the rant)< /review>< pics>

For one of the only places to offer food in the immediate area, it's pretty good. Selection of food will satisfy most, seating is plentiful and even faintly picturesque if you opt for a window or outdoor spot. Due to the monopoly of eateries in the park, it's naturally overpriced for what you get- which is likely my only gripe for this place.</text>

<review>First a warning to visitors who don’t know the de Young Cafe system: in addition to their pricey menu you will be charged a surcharge which is a percentage to pay for their health insurance. Foreign visitors of course will also be surprised by the additional sales tax. I asked the cashier girl why the tax was so high and she still would not disclose the health insurance surcharge until I read my receipt - not very professional. It felt like she had intentions to deceive the customer.
In terms of their food: it is just so so. I had a pre-made turkey sandwich. The french bread they used was tough at the least. Instead of lettuce they used shredded cabbage. I suppose it prevents the sandwich from getting soggy. I didn’t have the chance to try anything else because they were getting ready to close.
Service was average. Most workers were not that into the job.</review>< Pictures>

The window seats are fantastic. The atmosphere is nice. However my chicken wrap was $10 and that ain't cool.  Food is way overpriced... And not all that tasty</text>

<text>A decent selection of food, although I could always use more vegetarian options, and a very nice spot to eat. Can be a bit on the pricey side, but if you're not wanting to pack a lunch, it's a decent option while you're visiting the museum. Eating in the outside area is quite lovely.</text>< Resp>

A good place to eat while in the park. A good selection from quick sandwiches to full entrees. No table service. Bright, open cafe with nice views of museum grounds.<//Review>

New cuisine to test but also all kind of commons stuffs. Try the raspberry soup which is very tasty. The ambiance is nice too.

If you don't want to test, don't go there, nothing great to see.</Review>

< Review>
My Take: museum food that is actually pretty damn good | Went For: Sunday & holiday lunch | The Vibe: families welcome, day-drinking encouraged, desserts galore and art sculpture as a back drop | Special Dish: Duck Sausage over Pasta or daily soups | Avoid Their: Tuna Salad on old and nasty rye bread | Price Point: most well-sized dishes are under $15.00 | The Service: stellar all the way around | Reservations: n/a | FYI, FRIENDS: skip the inside seating, and soak up some arts and sun on their patio -- Eat up, Kimmie<//Review>

Fantastic cafe in the midst of a museum. They always fresh ingredients for their dishes (the ones pre-made in the plastic containers are not as good, so select from the freshly made menu).

I have had their soup of the day - always amazing. the flatbread is excellent.

If it's not too cold, definitely sit outside in the sculpture garden - love the space!< /review>

Nice place to have lunch. Access to the cafe is possible without entering the museum. In summer there are tables outside in the sculpture garden.<//Text>

Did you know that you can go to the cafe without going to the museum? The museum's sculpture gardens are also free to visit.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful outdoor space to eat fine cuisine in the middle of Golden Gate Park.

Impeccable service, large area protected from the rain thanks to the beautiful Swiss architecture of the De Young museum.

Fresh seafood. Among the best shrimp I have eaten. Good little starter of prochuto, asparagus, cheese served as a small refined pizza. A little disappointed by the macaroons.

Excellent views, beautiful sunshine, a great way to start our week in San Francisco.

(Original)
Bel espace extérieur pour manger de la fine cuisine en plein milieu du Golden Gate Park.

Service impeccable, grande zone protégé de la pluie grâce à la belle architecture Suisse du musée De Young.

Fruit de mer frais. Parmi les meilleures crevettes que j'ai mangé. Bonne petite entrée de prochuto, asperges, fromage servi comme un petite pizza raffiné. Un peu déçu par les macarons.

Excellente vue, magnifique soleil, une belle façon de débuter notre semaine à San Francisco.< /Text>

< Review>
The lady who picked up my phone was rude. That was the first time I called them, I asked with respect that why two copies of a notarization just simply doubled the charge, it was another copy and one more signature. She didn't explain, answered shortly and showed no respect: "That's how it is. Every company has its operating cost, if you think it was too expensive you can go to another company." Yes, I did go to another company who was more professional and courteous. Go away, don't do business with them.< /Review>

This is my 2nd time using the service from Melody, this time for renewing my Chinese passport. It’s really convenient to have someone help through the process during COVID as I cannot go for the normal in-person visit. Melody also really knows well of the process, and provides detailed instructions and timely updates throughout the time! Will definitely consider go with their service again in the future!</text>

<Review>Melody is very knowledgeable and patient. During COVID 19, lots of offices were closed and she made very effective suggestions to help me get the paper I needed. Very professional, experienced and followed  through. She really cares for her clients and treats them as her friends. Cudos for a job well done Melody and thank you for all you've done for me.< /Review>< UserId.>

I am so impressive by the nice service of Melody, who is  the owner of this company. She is so professional, patient and kindness.  Although it was10pm at that night, she still came to my home to do the work just because I am pregnant. I am so appreciate. And she always tracking my packages on time. Excellent work. I will have no doubt for asking her to help me next time when I need the service. Fast Visa Service owns more than Fast. Thankful...< /review>

Saw this place on the way to work all the time. This Christmas, me and my husband are planning to travel to China but we don't have visa yet. So i just stopped by to ask about it. The place owner is a Chinese couple, the lady is so nice and patient to explain all the details and materials that i need to provide. I wasn't prepare anything on that day and was out of town for the next week, she even come to pick up documents from me at late night on that day. I would say the service is fabulous and the price is fare. I won't hesitate to bring future clients to this establishment. The whole process is smooth and work is nice & tidy. If you are looking for some place to do the visa, TRUST ME, come here, you won't feel regret. BTW, they also do legalization and other staff. Highly recommended!< /text>

<Text>Got the Power of Attorney authentication from Chinese consulate with Melody’s help. She is very helpful and responsible. Melody will help you to prepare the Power of Attorney as long as you provide the requested documents. And after that, she will take care of everything. It is much easier than you do those whole things by yourself. You can also choose when you want to get the authentication, each with different price. I wanted to get the authentication soon so I bought the express service. But Chinese consulate took more than 4 days so I got my refund back without any problem. And when Melody got your documents back, she also has the service to help you to mail those documents back to China if it is needed. And she will ask you if the mail is got delivered or not afterwards. She is vey responsible and warm hearted. If I need those documents again in the future, I will definitely come back.</Text></record>

(Translated by Google) During the application for the green card, Omi was particularly complete with all the necessary materials, was serious and responsible, and had a particularly high efficiency, so I got the green card in half a year!

<review>(Translated by Google) Very professional, and efficient. Very professional, and efficient. Because I live in South Bay, the owner personally drove over to me to help collect information and sign. The three-level certification charges are reasonable, and the full-site service is well received. Hope there will be opportunities for cooperation in the future.

(Original)
Very professional, and efficient. 专业又有效率。因为我本人住在南湾所以owner亲自开车过来我这边帮忙收集资料和签字。三级认证收费合理，全站式服务，好评好评。希望以后还有合作的机会。< /review>< username>

(Translated by Google) Melody people are very kind and do things quickly and attentively. When my parents emigrated because of some changes in the family, they didn't see the letter to hand in the documents. As a result, they missed the time to hand in the documents. I thought it would be a waste of all the fees I paid before. Although it had expired for a month, Melody still tried my best to write me a letter of love, and then handed over the information. I received it two months later. Echo, and successfully invited. Thank you so much, I also like her professional and serious work attitude.

(Original)
Melody人很亲切，做事又快又细心，在做我爸妈移民的时候因为家里发生了一些变故，没看到䃼交文件的信件，结果错过了䃼交文件的时间。以为要从头再做一次辛请了也浪费了之前所交的一切费用，虽然已经过期一个月了，但是Melody还是尽力的帮我写求情信，再䃼交资料，两个月后我就收到了回音，并成功辛请了。太感谢她了，也非常喜欢她专业和认真的工作态度。<//Review>

店主很NICE哟，解释的很详细，一再提醒要先给中国看一看是否可行。最后还有直邮回中国的服务，很贴心，省了我不少的事。下次有需要，还会再来。</Review>< Pictures>

There was some great items I found like winter shirts, bathing suits, dresses. They have some great pricing for a thrift store. Refer to their schedule of prices because it changes everyday. Closed on Sunday and monday.< /text>

They were pretty organized for an afternoon shopping trip!! They were well stocked, it was 4.00 day and the bins were full. Clerks were friendly and provided us with very quick service! We love to shop there!
Will go back many more times, Soo many good things, from car parts to women's underwear, food etc. You never know until you get there!!
Good luck & have fun! 💖<//Text>

< Review>
Beyond fed up, I came in with my mother on Tuesday. I am 8 months pregnant. My mom and I came twenty min early and found our place in line we asked around who had what number. Then when the security guard started calling numbers he called ours... So we hurried to the front door and told him he called ours. He then began to yell at me and my mother stating that he can send us to the back of the line for being late. I tried to explain to him people with higher numbers cut us. He could care less he kept speaking over me and wouldn’t let me explain and stated next time we are going to the back of the line. Falling prices where is your customer service!!! I follow your rules I have no idea how you train your employees but he needs a major talking to he obviously isn’t doing his job if he is allowing people to just cut in line. I have gone to Folsom and have never once been yelled at your service there sucks.</Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>I would give this place an 7/10 for the "grabbag idea" of a store. Great sales. They absolutely don't enforce mask or social distancing protocols set by the county. 100% of the time 6ft distance or proper mask attire was not encouraged. The employees set the bar, so when they don't wear their mask when talking to customers, the customers will follow not taking the pandemic seriously.
*Not safe for people of all ages* They said they'd let in 100 people which is over the limit for a store of that size.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Is it Falling prices or falling apart?  Why is It that in our presence as  loyal  customers, the employees seems to be making it hard for us to shop.  They bring out the boxes supposedly to refill the wooden bins but as they go along choosing the nicer items by checking the original prices from their phones and then they set it aside for whatever purposes, perhaps saving for their friends.  I’ve seen one girl handed out a nice stuff to another customer then when I ask for one she refused.  I paid  a year membership of $49 plus another fee depending what day hoping to get better items but even I was number 1 in the line the merchandise were  already preselected and set aside.  The hype and excitement like when they first introduce the store is no longer there.  I agree to comments that  dignity  is like taken away from us by the way the staff who doesn’t show any respect but to their friends or relatives they serve it like in a silver platter.

SO Disappointing and disgusting!</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Packages open products missing and sold as is.  Being told often to bring back carts even though I am a regular customer, and clearly not the one breaking the rules that so many others ignore! Too crowded, with many not observing the social distance rule or masks. The clear rule breakers are not approached as they should be. Food mixed in with chemical products leaking, it is unclear which products are affected or contaminated.  Parking is a nightmare, I was almost hit by a van attempting to leave the crowded parking lot, I now have a series of door dings on my car doors.  Female store manager is very rude person with long brown curly hair, so unprofessional when asked questions about the products, so snappy, as though you are bothering her.<//review><Date>1602028528626</Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<Text>Good prices when you can find something you need or want.  Never been on $6.00 day but I've found deals on other days.  Beware!  Do not leave your cart unattended even if you are still shopping.  The guard will throw your things back into the bins and point out this small handwritten sign scolding you for leaving your cart unattended.  Other than that, it's an adventure.</Text>< user_name>

<Review>First time for the Tuesday morning check in & line up for the $6 scores.

I was #107, and I was in the door by 10:10. The line moved quickly, people were civil for the most part...it is a shame adults need to be told "you must line up by your number" and  "don't run in the store".

I am happy with my purchases and will venture back another day.  Kudos to the staff and security for a job well done.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

When I really think about why I gave it 4 stars I have to wonder why I didn't give it 5. And although the prices are more than a great deal it would do me good to walk in with the manners of a Banshee and open boxes like nobody's business. On more than one occasion I have gotten home to find the package I bought had already been used. Like the package of beef jerky I bought</Review>

Went in yesterday and things have changed so much since a year ago. They used to have a new batch of items every Tuesday and it would start at $6 then the price would drop every day.
Now the items they think will sell for more seem like they're pulled aside to try and sell for $6 next week. You used to have a chance to get great deals on things later in the week if they hadn't been bought.
Most of the bins are full of clothes, drapes and bedding and you can't look through the bins very well. Just too crammed with cloth.
If I wanted to sort through clothes no one wants I'd have gone to a thrift store. It seems like they changed their whole business model. Really sad because we used to take in our kids and end up spending hundreds of dollars a month on cool items, snacks and cases drinks.
The staff are friendly but they keep condensing the bins so that they're so crammed it isn't worth even looking.
Maybe a new owner or manager took over that doesn't understand why this place was cool and changed things up to try and maximize profits.
I'll give it one more try but if the experience is similar to yesterday's I won't go back.</text>

< Review>
A piece of advice: Don’t go there unless if you are agree to be degraded and insulted.
I was at the store on Tuesday. I stood in line. The security, who was standing at the door, started yelling at everyone in line over the speakerphone multiple times like we are his prisoners.
In addition, the lady manager was so rude and unprofessional treating people like mosquitoes.
I wanted to ask the store owner to read my post but it seems that he/she doesn’t care about what is going on in the store and how customers are being treated.
After that day, i promised myself not to go back at the store at all to save my dignity from being degraded.< /Review>

Started out great the first few months, but now items you could get in bulk for 6.00 are now split up and are 6.00 per item such as crest used to be able to find a box of 3 for 6.00 now individual tubes are 6.00 or maybe less if you go on another day. The better items are snatched up by the first through the door and not as many of the better items as in the past. I was going every week sometimes twice a week now I go about once a month and the last couple of times left empty handed if I do find something its not worth waiting in line for. Maybe if they had a store in the South Sacramento Elk Grove area I would check it out more often but not worth the gas to drive across town for anymore.</Review>

Have been to this place since the opening and have had great deals. Truly a wonderful store, honestly. However, today when we were given a box to put our belongings in, there was a large cockroach in it. Not sure if we will be returning but deals have been great so far.</text>

Falling prices has brought the most business that I have ever seen in this particular location ever. It has also brought jobs and attracted other businesses to this location. I've been in Carmichael for 20 years and the only time I have seen an attraction like it is the parades marathons.  Thank you for being there for me and my family and friends. Without you it would be the same old homeless attraction.< /review>

I asked manager Annie if I could use the bathroom, and she said that they do not allow customers to use the restroom because  they were concerned that customers could use the restroom  to steal things!  She confirmed that their restroom is closed to the public. Then she suggested  that I go to Subway sandwich to use theirs.<//review>

Sometimes in the early morning when the store opens there is a very long line of people waiting to enter. There are shopping carts to use while shopping. Once inside the store, you will see large wooden boxes, they are filled with items. Some items may not be worth what you can purchase them in a regular store. Some items my be less than what they would cost in a regular store. Some of the food items have expired dates on them and some don't. There are household items,toys, food,clothes, office supplies and much more. Every day the merchandise changes, you never know what will be for sale. Thursday I bought 4 decks of Bicycle playing cards for $2.00. Think of it as a treasure hunt, be careful when buying items here stop and think what would it cost in a regular store.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>I love shopping here!  It's an a giant treasure hunt!  I don't bother with rushing in for a shopping cart(limited supply) I take a big blue Ikea bag.  Once the initial rush subsides, a cart becomes available pretty frequently.  There are some rude shoppers though, just don't let them ruin your adventure.  Have fun and happy shopping!<//text>< pics>

It has good deal  bargains but you got to get a number, which is handed out to you at the back of the store @7 am and store doesn’t open till 10 am. But beware that food is expired date of manufactured. Also very aggressive costumers willing to push and shove others for getting things. Store is not organized, no refunds or returns.</Review>

This was my 2 ND time at this store. If the 3rd time is anything like the 2nd trip it will be my LAST trip. It was 2.00 day and there was nothing in the store worth anything more than .50 On top of half of the store was closed off.<//Text>

<text>Who ever suggested this place doesn't exist is wrong. I've never seen that question on Google before. When I looked up the hours today, Google said a user suggested this place doesn't exist and asked me if they were correct. Weird, I've been to it and have made purchases three times since they opened. What kind of  portal am I stepping through that they're not? Get on the ball, the address is the same as Hogwarts. If you know, you know. Just go to the train station and look for it. But not if you're a Muggle. They can't find it.< /text></record>

The way they clajm the store works is Tuesdays everything in the store is $6.  What doesn't sell that day will be $4 the next day then $2. Friday eveything left is $1 and Saturday is 25 cent day. What they don't tell you is that they cheat. First everything starts in boxes so for example a case of 40 waters $6. But 25 cent day they break the water case down and you now get a bottle of water for the 25 cents. Or.... They take the case of water off the floor on $2 day and hold it till $6 day. I figured this out because there was a pallet of soda machines at closing on $2 day. I was there when they opened the next morning they Were gone.<//text>

I really like falling prices there is nothing else like it  I live in Carmichael and I just stumbled across this place  I never heard anything about a new store opening at all nothing so I was shocked to see the hoards of people and the full to the max parking lot and blown away when I entered falling prices the first time it's hard to describe it but at least 50boxes 4'+8' full of Amazon's returned items anything that Amazon sells could be in these boxes and it is like gold fever and people not all but most have lost all there manners and turned into anamals only care of themselves and it a a real sad thing that people can step out of the person they are and act like that and not be botherd by it is upsetting  to witness but they just return do it some more  I avoid any of the aggressave people people that come close.lm there trying to have fun digging for treasure but with these hiennas  lurking it ruins the coolest thing I've ever seen at a store before< /review>

People go early to get tickets to get in line and then when the time comes to get in line no one gets in line in their according number. The security just stays there on his phone not wanting to get odder. Some people might have a number in the hundredths and go to the front of the line and try or sometimes get inside the store. Items can be broken and there is no refunds and most food is expired or soon to go bad.<//Text>

You will find products that normally cost a lot
But you can find it at less of the normal cost
Like Acure brightening lotion for your face 100% vegan at $4.00 on Wednesday and if you are lucky at $2.00 on Thursday and some other stuff like
Curel body wash, Toms toothpaste, Next generation laundry detergent, method cleaners,
Deodorants, Aveeno lotions, baby shampoo, blind for your Windows and so much much much more< /text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Name>

staff was very rude. told me to “stop opening boxes” after i was looking at an already opened box. i politely told her that i haven’t opened the box and she proceeded to tell me that “i don’t care.” may be treating me  this way because i’m a teenager. but it doesn’t matter i’m just another paying customer. ruined my day.<//Review>

If you need tampons this is the place to go, they have tampons everywhere, with the coffee, cereals, tools, on the floor, but if u can stand a bit of tampon digging you might finda deal on some tools toys cookies toothpaste mouthwash but mostly tampons, I don't know who returns tampons to Amazon but if you are the one please stop, please stop I beg you...........<//text>

Probably would have been better if I had gotten there earlier as booth's were either closed or had only limited stuff left. Seemed well set up with good observation of safety rules.<//Text>

It's the start of our Farmers Market. It takes a bit for everybody to show up, like every year. Veggies and fruit grow at their on pace. One must be patient. Bought organic strawberries. The best !!!!< /Text>

It's not the biggest Farmers Market you have ever been to, but it is ours. The Livermore Farmers Market, especially on Thursday's in the summer, is a great place to hang out, eat food, and get some amazing produce.  For a few years now we have made an effort to go and have dinner with friends and pick up some fruit and veggies.</Review>

Not the biggest farmer's market in the world, and prices can be a little high at some of the vendors, but it's great for the community. I especially like when they have a band setup during the summer months.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Sunday afternoon farmers market. Small selection. Little over a dozen booths. Produce, berries, jams, meat, hummus were all to be found there. Typical farmers market pricing.<//Text>

The Sunday market is a great deal. The variety of vendors has improved a lot over the years and there's generally plenty of parking available within a short walk.</text>

I lovey local farmers​ market! The sellers remember you week to week and are very friendly, you can carefully bargain, and there are families having picnics all around.

Minus one star for really long lines at the prepared food stands. Getting a crepe feels like waiting for the latest iPhone.<//Review>

The produce needs to be consumed within a day or two or it goes bad.

<text>I had a great experience with G & C Auto Body. The body work they did on my car was outstanding and I appreciated the attention to detail and the effort to explain everything to me. Connor kept in touch throughout the work so I knew what to expect. Everyone was friendly, professional, and caring, it's a pleasure to give them Five Stars.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>I highly recommend G & C for auto body repairs. Someone keyed my drivers door on my 2020 Hyundai. It looked beautiful when I picked it up. I would not hesitate to use the Sonoma location again if needed. Thank you!</review>< pics>

I brought it to the Rohnert Park office but it was actually finished by the Sonoma office.  Both offices were prompt, friendly, and very helpful. Fast and timely repairs to my baby!! The receptionist at the Rohnert Park office went so far as to save a few things for me that I forgot in my rental car!< /Review>

He went way beyond by getting the repairs done same day, personally giving me a ride home, and being incredibly kind and honest.  Sonoma is lucky to have him.
The work the shop did is flawless and was completed sooner than I expected.
Elizabeth at the front desk clearly takes a lot of pride in her work.  She is incredibly professional, polite, and helpful.  She greats you by name, offers you multiple beverages, makes extra calls for you and generally creates a very welcoming and comfortable experience.
This shop is unlike any other auto body shop where I've ever been.  I will absolutely come again and recommend Sonoma G&C to everyone I know.<//review>< Response>

Sonoma G&C are awesome. The manager, Frank, is careful, friendly and efficient. The woman at the front desk knows her stuff. Very professional office. I felt totally confident and the end product was STUNNING. Perfect work. I got hit by a State Farm insured, which brought me to this shop. Thinking of switching to State Farm, too...<//Text>

I had an excellent experience at G&C Auto Body in Sonoma. The staff was INCREDIBLY kind, especially Frank, Luis and the receptionist. They take great care of their guests and do phenomenal work. I was planning on having my car in the shop for a couple of days. They finished working on my car in about six hours.  A rental car was ready for me upon dropping off my vehicle. It was such a smooth transition. I highly recommend them for any and all vehicle repairs.</Review>

<Text>This shop is great! I had some issues in getting my car fixed and they were able to help me every step of the way. They make sure to go above and beyond for their customers, even driving me to pick up my rental when it was late! Frank was so amazing and incredibly helpful in ensuring that my car was repaired to G&C's satisfaction. I would most definitely recommend this shop to anyone who needed service done to their car. They even washed my car for me! I will be coming back for any future repairs.

I took my auto over to G&C in Sonoma.  Frank looked over the damage, took photos, and gave me a detailed estimate for parts and repair.  Within a day and a half..the work was done.  Five Star quality, and the rental car was easily accessed.  The total was a lot less than than first estimated.  I am really impressed with G&C auto body, and Frank is a great fellow, who really knows his business.  Top Notch !!!!!</Text>

I HIGHLY recommend this Body Shop. My truck, a 2016 Toyota Tacoma, looked better than new when I picked it up. The attention to detail was excellent and Frank went out of his way to get the truck to me for my move, making me feel like I was his only client. GREAT PLACE to bring your vehicle.<//Review>

<Text>Simply AMAZING!! The staff at G&C were super friendly, helpful and most importantly professional. G&C made sure my car looked spectacular, which I truly appreciate. I drive a 2019 and my insurance wanted to use after market parts for the replacements. G&C made sure that my car obtained the parts from the car's maker. I totally reccomend this shop!!</Text>< Pics>

I will be taking my vehicle back to G & C Autobody in Sonoma because of the excellent and honest service I received from Frank. Someone hit the back bumper of my vehicle and did not leave a note, so I was left to have to fix my bumper and another auto body shop quoted around $1,000. I have insurance but it still would have ended up costing $500. I got a second opinion at G & C and Frank came out personally, looked at the bumper, told me exactly what I needed to order from the car dealership, and said he would fix it at NO cost! Why? Because it was pretty much cosmetic and he was honest: he just said it wasn't worth spending all that money when ultimately it was likely to get bumped again, maybe more substantially where I would really need to remove the bumper and have it replaced. He could have charged me, but instead told me it could be buffed and painted over and he didn't see the need to charge me for that. So incredibly helpful and so gracious. It earned my trust that G & C Auto Body in Sonoma was going to be honest about true repair needs in the future. Also, the staff there was super friendly and nice and that makes a huge difference in your day. Thank you, G & C Auto Body Sonoma!</review>

I went into G&C today. For starters the women at the front very nice. Anyways I had a problem I had created with my car handle. The guys there were nice enough to spend 20 mins to help me fix my mistake at no charge. They even declined a tip. Thank you Dimitri and Fabian. Hands down awesome place.< /text>

I definitely was not interested in shelling out a grand and when I said that I thought I'd just go the "touch up" route, he offered to do it for me and didn't charge a thing.

I was discussing the need to replace my car bumper and saw a scratch in the paint on the body of the car. I asked if they could fix it and how much would that cost? Justin's response implied he thought I was trying to get them to repair the scratch and have the insurance company pay for it. I don't appreciate the implication that I am both a liar and a cheat.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Another US visiting spot last year is temporarily closed.   There are a lot of caverns (natural ones) in the US.  Mercer Caverns was discovered many years ago and it’s being run by the third generation now.  Anyway, the caverns were found and maintained very well to allow visitors in and out safely via ladders and ropes.  There are a lot of stalactites to form some chandler caves which are amazing and magnificent.  The caverns are underground to be as deep as 16? floors (I recalled the other Cavern (near Stockton?) is deep enough to hold the Statue of a Liberty), so it has lights to let visitors follow the guide safely.  Overall, it’s an excellent experience to see the beauty and greatness of the Mother Nature.< /review><pics>[{'url':

Ask questions to get more stories and information. Kind of cheesy that you get a bumper sticker at the end, but hey, it's a thing. I prefer smaller tour sizes and less kids (they need to be supervised!) but have been on large and small tours. My 6 year old loved it. The stairs are not very accessible for people with mobility concerns - there are very steep sections, bending/stooping required. If you're claustrophobic, you can try it out - there are more open areas interspersed with the tighter places. Worst case you go back and ask if they'll refund or discount your ticket. Most staff have been young and laid back. They don't allow purses so leave it in the car (or they might bug you about it with multiple reminders that you can't take it on the tour until you comply). I love this place and learn something new every time.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlwIkCmiD4-Z8V7WWC1xXIA6NROgvKf4QwfwMN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzafLRSS2tBabFLKnIHNRsq2r44in096TyNmFX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtoEXBJHLB1s7UKBBuSM5ZeWPQyQt8diZRNQgK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVJ5Q5wE9pOvkMm6DewWcj0vSYK_mjDkPvWKrO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4PPGsj-Wa7mXP5NwY0eYh2pDuicRJbL1vizs_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp-s3ybmkvlKentbF5MTXoDLnDpP7FQgkIZLP9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORainZtTBix66QzZvz23jxfUPW9UloY-LI_IFw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNELO6bO-Grzld6ftA5b3t_b4MYKCQy1rHkrPww=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBmxyR-0scabzQ-cNjUu7rH502zlyPpgJHAiqI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh-97kYiY8bOAEE6TrteD7Z4-_f_GzQRv0C9Al=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe_clXpZKuleRZKRZXwmNvFHx5IwSZyI2P1Pd7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNxeKz_M9k-DhTw53ScxABr31LgTL8NGUuS0xf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMivGxKm0ILWJNfFMbLjRkEkGaUwxgmfXzyVYGs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPccsJD5uwcPUXtOi0o2PV5SJtO0Jh1XBwaa1FP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5Zrtl5awX6ExAFikhGV8kZAGMLz1hatIEdXAJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPO1MmIXP6slJ0pklmzeJMKAJCpT1afPS6i5whl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTgsAmFQkm5U6jRfEdgn2ZvVhcznruvP2GlCGS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIyDHGdpaWNpUE1VNRDiH6dPtjBN0FUxWgVzKh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe-kfWhyPIUvJXCOLvmiUaMVYgM6J6OZtmx-th=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvbZbc-hb9Ov55ztlHwjVTw40-3Gc-LUaXl-VU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4aFDDsT1Q9SEUXSTC8WcgOmlPbnsfUfADpMJa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvguARMkPqsSVJrIL1JolIqx8cxlkq-Iyq56In=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkPEZPk7pGN6d8GzKVUuasUK3F1HI_lm7Q8993=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<text>The caverns are small compared to the larger ones in the US such as Carlsbad Caverns. However, every portion of the cave is full of incredible formations. This is great place for anyone fascinated by geology. The price wasn't bad either, I think I paid $15. There are very steep steps going through the cave so this is not a great place for elderly or less mobile people. Also not for really big people because it does get narrow at a few points. The temperature is cooler in the cavern like all caves so bring a light jacket. The tour isn't very long so you wont freeze. Very cool place. Holiday weekends can be crowded. Tickets can only be purchased on site. The town nextdoor is another place to check out.</text>< GmapID>

So amazing. Gorgeous. A living cave - that you can VISIT. You've gotta go. It's beautiful, the tour guides are knowledgeable, and it smells so good in there (kinda musty, fresh, reminds me of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride - I know, weird). Be ready to climb, though. The tours are not designed for those with physical limitations.< /Review>

Fun cave tour with beautiful formations. A simple descent on an old wooden staircase/path takes you over 160 feet underground. Along the way the guide points out the unique limestone formations and provides a history lesson of cave discovery and exploration over the years. The return path goes up steep steps with some tight spots.  Took about 45-60 minutes total time. Cute little gift shop with lots of geological trinkets.< /review>

This place was fun! The tour was super fascinating our a guide was rather amusing. Heads up you are doing a significant amount of stairs but we had kids that were 7 on our tour and they did it without a problem. If you are an adult there are parts were you will have to duck under different formation.

I can totally see my husband and I going again. It was also insanely close to Murphy's and a pretty drive up.<//review>

Good place. Caverns are a trip of six stories down. Parking is very small so if you arrive at pick hours you would not find parking. It is a mile from Murphy’s town which is a great place for dining and shopping. The big trees areas is a great place for a weekend.< /text>

These caverns are truly stunning. The place is in the middle of nowhere, and you should make sure to get there well in advance, probably at least 30 minutes, to ensure you get tickets in time. They give tours roughly every hour on the 1/2 hour. Our tour guide was super knowledgeable and an excellent guide. We took our three children who are four and under, carrying two of them. It did not seem like nearly as many stairs as we thought it would be. Note that you cannot bring anything with you except what can fit in your pockets and cannot carry a child on your back. We also purchased a geode rock from the little store and had fun watching them crack it open and looking at the crystals inside. Our kids also explored the hillside, which is covered in boulders, while we waited on an open tour.<//text>

Great place, we were worried that it would be cold. I worn shorts and a hoodie and I was very comfortable. It was nice going into the cave, learn a lot. The tour was about an hour long, but during the tour their is a lot of scary stairs to climb. People who are tall it is much harder. Still it is a nice time. Would recommend for everyone though.</text>

This is a must see if in the area.  Be ready to walk a lot of stairs as you desend and then resend multiple stories.  The rock formations are majestic and really make it worth the trip.<//Text>

<review>It's quite  a climb down and up but was  worth it . My grandkids thought it was great. Nice and cool down there didn't want to come out to the heat. They also have a nice gift  shop. Beautiful  to see.< /review>< pics>

Loved this cavern been going up to the sierra foothills on the weekends for nice drives and adventure found this cavern and was glad i did lots to see a 45 minute tour for 17 bucks was worth it maybe not the best place if afraid of tight places and steep stairs but i had great time.</Review>

<text>Loved this cavern been going up to the sierra foothills on the weekends for nice drives and adventure found this cavern and was glad i did lots to see a 45 minute tour for 17 bucks was worth it maybe not the best place if afraid of tight places and steep stairs but i had great time.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKH-aUUQrOyabnd5Bf0DivpKw3hHB_g6u5umng=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm5aM3rAhRIuemVIyBeP3JQUFTEL-Fa2hw3G0D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5pLRhD6kZyzgUtFC0l_vYeaPPGfan0A1Iuz_c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0vekcM5t9hsGio4FiQbh766u69TZchVArkX74=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQQYhIuGcFuW12znZGtPjqPlrhK2j_UQfMR0Re=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN65pKdecBueoWcT5T5O6747LcH-Ub_vs6IuxLN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4JXiVLuU-h0ZzXmgzbNaKSsh4YOcB9agBELTm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUEZ5VFNpFAIQ-SlXiGeyoEUvtGFEHQvGc2tZA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM__gCl5Cml0YnnmGxNiOspPfgL8w9u5sEuJoGX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKCR7G1YEBA8iD0l7uq4zXI8NVXrF9kOa1r_QH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFdIBaugK1QvwEAdErrMbzKRvMkQmno-Ur8CS2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy5dI5C56LrTG52Y6FFWaHpzvdEyeHSOJpKaBb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN83e40oP-JrZbDu62ZMoO4UWtOCm5AIoZdOsJc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIPnzI1-pRBdpdFqrhySz2qCdJAcYuuPlUtVs8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUa1xwQZWwQMm_tqQnO-J2W0WCwIQpreqxLYBP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

<text>The cavern itself is super cool. The jokes made by the guide were super corny for the platoon of adults in our group. The guide's voice had a sing song delivery that reminded me of the way a kindergarten teach delivers instructions. As of July 2017 the cost = $16 for ~25 minute tour. If you get cold easily, bring long sleeves because (spoiler alert), caverns are cold.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVTgFZSya72b2jJidkQnkeL2PRbR-8qUJtOFjb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Interesting place. Good tour guide. Worthwhile visit, especially if in the area for camping or skiing. History was fascinating, even more so when you are onsite. Not good for people claustrophobic or afraid of the dark. Probably better to go with friends you can trust.</Review>

We did the 40-50 minute tour in late November. Our guide was informative and comical. There are some pretty tight spaces to pass through at times for taller people (I'm 6'1"). There are a lot of stairs throughout the tour which are very narrow and steep, but there are generally handrails on both sides and I'd recommend using them!

Overall a great experience for the $17 entrance fee.< /text>

< Review>
This is one of the coolest most unique caves I've toured. The Crystal formations are amazing, the tour guide was very knowledgeable and entertaining. There are many steep steps to the bottom, places where you have to really scrunch down to avoid hitting your head, and then you have to climb back up! If you're not in somewhat good shape, I wouldn't recommend it. But, it is very beautiful and even magical! I highly recommend it if you're up to it!</Review>

<review>An employee ran out to the parking lot to let us know a tour was leaving in a few minutes so we didn't have to wait around. The tour itself is not for the out of shape. Steep stairs make it a bit of a workout. Taylor was an informative and funny guide. A great stop on the trip.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Great historic tour but if claustrophobic, beware! Cool adventure into a hole in the ground to see awesome underground cave. Steep stairs and awesome guide. I am claustrophobic but made it since it was so interesting but had to really concentrate!<//text>< Pics>

The staff is very friendly.  My 5 year old son and I were the only ones for the morning tour and he got scared.  The guide was very nice and understanding.  We went right back up and got our money back.  Then used the sluice box to find some "gold" as my son called it.  I've been in the caves before,  they are worth it too.<//Text>

This was a great tour amd we had an amazing tour guide. She was knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor. Note that the walk in and out has many stairs and if you have difficulty getting around you may want to pass on this o e.<//review>

Don't forget to say hello to Bernard, the friendliest man alive & a National Treasure himself!!! Always a pleasure to see the beautiful formations in the cave. The tour guides are wonderful, most of them are very funny & make the tour super special. The general store is awesome, all kinds of neat things in there, history, natural rocks, gems, sea shells & geodes. Awesome place, a must visit of the 49er trail of the Mother Lode.< /Review>

This place was awesome. The tour was fantastic. If you are really tall, claustrophobic, cannot climb ladders, i would not recommend it. My kids were 10 and 11, they had no problems moving thru the caverns</Text>

<Review>I felt all 16 flights of stairs for the next two days, but it was worth it. Absolutely stunning limestone formations and a knowledgeable guide made it an interesting and informative 45 minutes. The few minutes in the dark near the end didn't bother me, but heads up for those it might. As the guide said, just close your eyes and you'll see what we're seeing.<//Review><user_id>109061293038367936922< /user_id><Gmap_id>0x8090bc547a923237:0x4307942181ba8b48< /Gmap_id>< Rate>

Had a wonderful time walking through the tour. Tour guide was very knowledgeable with good sense of humor. I thing I would not recommend on doing if you have babies/toddlers is to not bring them to the tour. It can be dangerous. Stairs can be really steep and slippery.<//Text>

<text>Mercer Caverns was a really interesting cave tour with lots of chambers. The story of Mr. Mercer is very interesting and I was surprised to learn that Mercer Caverns is now owned by the same group the bought the Mystery Spot in Santa Cruz. The caverns are well worth a visit and the scenery on the drive out is spectacular. I would also recommend a stop in Colombia on your way back from the caverna.
Enjoy!</text><Date>1551244667138< /Date>< name>

I've been here several times.  This is a must see cave structure.  Tours are guided and affordable.  There is even a small gift shop.  I would recommend kids be able to walk up and down long flights of stairs before making a trip to the caverns.  It's a steep decent and narrow at points, so carrying children isn't an option.<//review>

This is one of the most preserved caves. You go down 16 stories into this cave. There are very tight stairs to navigate but is safe. Just not for wheel chairs and faint of heart.<//Text>

Like some of the other reviewers, we had a problem with the guide, Bernard, on our tour.  He was rude at the very beginning and insulted/mocked one of the other tourists that was having trouble keeping up with the group.  I should have insisted to go with a different guide later on, but unfortunately didn't and my experience suffered because of it.

At $17, the tour is a bit pricey for the size of the cave.  However, I was impressed with the different formations that were there.  There are a lot of stairs that are very steep, low ceilings, and it is damp; however, I never felt unsafe.  There are handrails throughout and the pace of the tour is very relaxed.

A couple of the tourists on the group had a very hard time with all the stairs, so this isn't for everyone.

They have a nice little souvenir shop whose prices, I thought, were amazingly low for a tourist destination.  We were excited and planned to buy a bunch of items after the tour, but the guide soured our experience so we left without purchasing anything additional.

Overall, a fun little cave to walk through; I just wish they trained the guides better.< /review>

< Review>
👍 Nice quality geological formations.

If you have young children that tend to cry, consider going to a different attraction. This beautiful cavern is rock, and the squeals of children completely obstruct listening to the guide.

Though not especially difficult. The steps can be high, ladders steep, and passages cramped. Those afraid of heights or enclosed spaces should reconsider how much they want to see this cavern.</Review>

< Review>
Great place to visit. Cold drinks and water sold in the gift shop. The caves were spectacular and the zip line was lots of fun. They drive you up to the launch tower, you'll zipline down to the landing, and then hike a short trail back to the center..</Review>

Great place if your into geology. It’s very educational, but the people who run it could be a bit more enthusiastic.< /text>

Mercer Caverns is a cool experience for those who have never been underground in a dark, yet safe environment.  The history of the caverns is fascinating and the natural wonders of the underground are vibrant and educational—DO NOT TOUCH the natural wonders—we want these beautiful formations to last for future generations.  The tour is safe for families, babies, young children—the infrastructure is well designed and supported for you and your family to enjoy the cavern experience.<//Review>

Very cool geology experience for those into that kind of thing. Not the best for kids but still kid friendly (it can get claustrophobic in some places). The whole tour takes about 45 minutes and you have to be in mild walking shape...there's quite a few stair flights you have to walk up to get out.</review>

Great tour. We went around Thanksgiving which is a busy time for this little operation. The tour guide was funny, but it is the typical case jokes. The kids liked them.

You also get the typical experience where they will show you formations that look like things. Use your imagination. The most remember part is when they turn off the lights!</review>

Not going to lie, I smoke a huge joint the size of a baby's arm before I walked into this place... Man on man, can a human being taken so much intense energy from beautiful mother Earth's lungs... I strongly recommend you visit this place, if you don't smoke weed, maybe you should start now that is finally legal, after so many people been in prisoned for what?... A plant?! ..psh.. anyways the staff has memorized the script so good, they make you feel like you lived in there for a few decades.</Review>

<text>A fun 45-minute climb down into a limestone cave with flowstone cascades and stalagmites. Our guide was friendly, patient and knowledgeable, both about the rocks and the history of the place.  You can take photos, but no bags are allowed  in the cave.  The steps can be a bit steep at times, but our group included a wide range of ages and all were fine.  Bring a sweatshirt as it can get a cool.</text>< Rate>

< Review>
Great experience for a class field trip or for individuals. Note: If going as a class they only take small  groups in at a time so the rest of the group must wait. If you are taking a large group consider splitting the group with half going to Columbia and half at Mercer and then switching.<//Review>

i brought my three nieces which never like to walk that far. Jerry was our guide. WOW if someone is made for that job its him. Jerry makes it so much fun. We heard a tour going on in front of us and they were way to serious. If you have a chance to see the Mercer Caves ask for Jerry for a great experience. The guy in charge is a little grumpy, so be careful of him. Overall Great Job Jerry!!<//review>

<review>If you are in the area, it is ok to check these out. But I won't recommend to drive couple of hours to see these, I have seen much better and several times larger and spacious limestone cave systems in East Cost. Here, you only get less than an hour of guided tour, which is rather rushed, and the cavern is very small too, you are not allowed to go in alone to explore it.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Had a great  time.  A lot  to  look  at
you should  call before  going  and make  sure there  isn't  a  school  bus group  coming  or a large  group  of  people  they have limited  space in the cavern  our group numbered  about  20 and that was about  max.  they won't  turn anyone away  if it is more people    but it does  make  it hard to get everyone   in and out  before  the  next tour start.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>Very poor customer service!! Go somewhere else. I drove my family for over 90 minutes to go here and they were closed for a private party. There was no notice on there website and no notice on there signs when entering. If they are unwilling to take an effort to notify the puplic that they will be closed due to private tours then we should not go to the effort with spending out time and $$ at this attraction. There are other caves close by to explore with much better customer service and a nicer staff</text>< Pictures>

Awesome caverns. Semi difficult climb unless you are under 4 feet tall and in shape. Amazing formations.< /Text>

Caves were cool, but the people who run this place are morons.  Arrived at 1pm, attempted to buy the tickets and a geode, and was told by the elderly cashier that they were resetting their system and it would be a few minutes. Fair enough. Browsed the shop while we waited for them to let us know the system was back up and could take cards. We checked back in with them after 10 minutes and was told, "Sorry buddy, you should've purchased the tickets when you first got here, we're sold out now." Right.  So we had to wait an hour for the next tour.  I'd give the caves 5 stars, and the bumpkins who run the place 1star.<//Review>

I had a great time at the cavern.  I've been to a few infamous caverns around the country and mercer was just as impressive!  For the most part the cavern has been very well preserved but the guy who found the cave in 1885 was a little reckless with some of the formations. The tour guide was very good at letting us know all about the history of the cave and all of it's formations.
The store could stand to offer more posters about the cave because the brochure really doesn't say too much.
If you're out of shape then the climb back up might be a little trying due to a steep sixteen story climb.<//review>

I mean it's not a pretty cave. You just walk down stairs, see rocks and walk back up. Gift shop needs an air conditioner<//review>

<Date>1470501266419< /Date><rate>5< /rate><text>A great way to beat the summer heat, the key features of this cavern compared to others in the area are its location, its rock formations, and the short length of the tour. A nice stop on the way to or from Calaveras Big Trees State Park, this cavern is only about 5 minutes off of Highway 4. The ultra-thin sheets that make the "Angels Wings" and the "Cave Bacon" and the aragonite mineral deposits are real highlights. Tours depart on the :30s in the morning and on the hour in the afternoon and last about 45 minutes, quite a bit shorter than other tours. Our guide was friendly, and the demonstration of total cave darkness was a nice touch.

There are no water features here, and not as many vast chambers as some other caves in the area, but we still enjoyed our time here. If anyone in your party can't handle the stairs, I would recommend leaving them in Murphys since there is no place to take refuge from the heat except for the cave itself.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Guide was rude, arrogant and disrespectful. Cave was average, not very exciting in the way of formations and colors. Don't waste your money.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Nice cave and a good opportunity to cool off and get out of the California sun. In some places you have to duck your head a bit and some stairs are steep. Unfortunately, most of the photos didn't work, but they are definitely worth a tour. Maybe the photos will work next time. They will then be delivered later. Outside you can sit in the shade and dig for gold.

(Original)
Schöne Höhle und eine gute Gelegenheit sich etwas abzukühlen und aus der kalifornischen Sonne zu kommen. An manchen Stellen muss man schon etwas den Kopf einziehen und einige Treppen sind steil. Leider sind die meisten Fotos nix geworden, aber definitiv einen Rundgang wert.  Vielleicht klappt es beim nächsten Mal mit den Fotos. Die werden dann nachgeliefert. Draußen kann man im Schatten sitzen und auch Gold schürfen.< /Text>< rate>

(Translated by Google) Excellent experience for lovers of the genre, these are very deep caves, passable on foot and in the presence of the guide, highly trained and amamte of his work. A suggestive and not very popular place, great to avoid tourists and immerse yourself in the unique atmosphere that evokes this place.

(Original)
Ottima esperienza per amanti del genere, trattasi di grotte molto profonde, percorribili a piedi e in presenza della guida, preparatissima e amamte del proprio lavoro. Posto suggestivo e poco frequentato, ottimo per evitare turisti e immergersi nell'atmosfera unica che evoca questo luogo.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful caverns in the heart of California. The tour is very nice and the guides are really good! You go down 200 steps and what you see is really beautiful and special.

Bellissime caverne nel cuore della California. Il tour è molto carino e le guide sono davvero brave! Si scende di 200 scalini e quello che si vede è davvero bello e partcolare.< /Text>

The place was empty when we walked in. The food had been sitting for quite some time. It's a bad sign that one plate was put in the microwave from the warmers, the other plate wasn't much warmer than room temperature. The quality is sub par and we've bought frozen food from the grocery store that tasted better. Thankfully it was at least better than the last place nearby we went to and we didn't get sick. The food was not fresh and didn't taste good plus some pieces were like leather. The meats being different kinds tasted similar as did the rice and noodles. We won't be coming back and we would not recommend this place to anyone.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>I really do not understand the bad reviews. Like at all. I guess if you are the typical L.A. person looking for a 5 star restaurant then this may not exactly match "standards" (the usual $15 plate for 1). I get a 3 entry meal for $6 and it serves me and my girlfriend with plenty leftover. Their food is delicious as well< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Their prices are super cheap for Chinese food. It's homemade and delicious. If you like additives go to Panda Express.

5.99 for an plate that feeds 2. You can't beat that. Me and my wife goes there all the time, and we often have leftovers.< /review>

Loved this cute little ice cream shop- I had been wanting to try it for years hearing so many good things about it but it was under construction for quite sometime. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there were several people in line- nothing more than a 10 min wait. The girl behind the counter was super helpful and let us try her favorites. I am OBSESSED with the lavender it is so delicious and I can't wait to have it again!</review>

Poké Bar Mid-Wilshire gives me triple the amount of scoop size as Mars Vista for the same price. My large bowl from this location was more like an extra small. I'm still starving, not just hungry. Total rip off<//Review>

<Review>I stopped by here because I had some time to kill and was craving poke. I didn’t expect it to be so good! The food was fresh, servings large, and prices were good. Nice that they had yogurt as well, but I didn’t try that so my review is on the food alone.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMESStunUACRCHNqfMgPeuGoZJQMytIdv0Wzjni=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNR-7iS9t_QOSI5r1NmAw6fMSzHObNZ65drWOrJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTvGLGQQSgCkpOCPfcq526oB_umJjmvdJYzxpG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEyYEvHPvg-9rnnxu_sE-1xHlSKtv9VGDVKeMu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyqmW4llZ4b9hSBfG0uQ-r43OJJo-WpGz5OEml=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1-tKD8IgVfCtgGsimryapmyWDFPrWcZkxA7AV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2ba67bbfd8f87:0x63ec279c8a11ddb3</GmapID></record>

<review>I didn't have poke here so I can't review that .  I ate the frozen yogurt maybe 5 times.  They have a good assortment of flavors and offer samples too.  I always resort to tart.  It seems very similar to Yogurtland as far as flavors go and the same set up.  I don't know if it's owned by the same company.  Either way its good and the gal at the counter could not have been more helpful and friendly.  It's in a great convenient location on the corner with parking small area in back.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2ba67bbfd8f87:0x63ec279c8a11ddb3</GmapID></record>

5 stars for innovation, they make these kale noodles that pair perfectly with poke. Wide variety of options for both poke and FroYo.

We got both to go and put the FroYo in our freezer while eating and it all turned out great.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2ba67bbfd8f87:0x63ec279c8a11ddb3<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Quick service and really good fish! Rice was the perfect temperature, cucumber tasted very fresh and stood out to me. I got the house spicy and it was a perfect flavor. Didn't love my Thai tea and the employees were nice enough to trade it for the tropical drink which was amazing! Super refreshing. Service was great, very attentive and courteous. Will be returning soon.<//Review>< time>

Amazing customer service! Interesting flavor options. The best vegan chocolate sorbet in town. It's clean, cute, and a great place to stop in for a sit down because it's just off the busy Dtla streets. Fantastic business.</text>

The owner, Tom, is so kind and helpful! He was happy to give us plenty of samples and explain the Filipino flavors we didn't understand. The ice cream is tasty and comes in large portions. Definitely check this place out and look for Tom!< /text>

<review>Love coming in hot they always have they old favorites and they change things up with new and exciting flavors on a regular basis. They have great system to earn free yogurt and if you are a yogurt lover as my family and me you enjoy the extra freebies.  Staff is always nice and accommodating and great at suggesting new flavors. Highly recommended.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>No line. No wait. Ice cream is BOMB. Parking can be a hassle since it's on a busy street but considering it's the city. Can't really complain. I got the 'secret breakfast' which had cereal in it. Hands down my favorite. I'll be back to try more flavors. Although I'll probably end up getting yhe same flavor.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Its never crowded here but there always seems to be people coming and going.

Theres no real service here, just cashiers who arent that friendly, some times they say hello when you walk in...sort of expected though as they probably dont make much.

Parking is easy, place is always empty.

They have a nice little rewards program.  The toppings are pretty basic but they do change out the flavors of the yogurt often.

My stepdaughter loves this place and we come here often.  Ive never tried the Poke bar, interesting concept POKE and Frozen Yogurt

Giv' it a try.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba67bbfd8f87:0x63ec279c8a11ddb3</Gmap_id><response>None<//response></record>

Best Poke I ever had without a doubt! Wow! Gobs and gobs of FLAVOR... So many toppings! I had a medium and it was huge! A medium has THREE types of protein. Usually when you get Poke it's all tuna.. I had three choices so had albacore, salmon and spicy tuna!! Crunchy onions, cucumbers, edamame, choice of rice, greens, noodles or mixed...and so Much more, sauces on top of sauces(staff helped me pile it on and gave suggestions- thank you!). I'm not impressed that easily.. this was delicious and everything was so fresh. I was moaning with each bite! (I really was!)

Best part... afterwards when craving dessert.. BOOM... They have frozen yogurt too! (With some great flavors (Reese's peanut butter cup, Carmel salted pretzel, of course Chocolate- and tons of toppings. I'll be back for sure!</Review>

This place is off the charts! Got the Banana Dulce de Leche. Amazing. Also took a bite of the Carmel sea salt ice cream sandwich! Off the charts delicious as well. Don't miss this place.

As an aside, don't get the milkshake or hot chocolate. Nothing to write home about on these two items.</text>

<Review>Poke and frozen yogurt what's not to love?

Poke is a recent addition, that fills up the previously empty counter space. The only issue is that the checkout lines for the yogurt runs counter the line for the poke. Despite them having a small 'Order Here' sign, you still have to go through line twice if you want both and it is somewhat confusing since the yogurt self serve is a strong indicator for people to walk straight to the back of the shop without looking around.

Often has a few dairy free offerings for the yogurt.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ba67bbfd8f87:0x63ec279c8a11ddb3</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Raw fish and frozen yogurt all in one stop! Place smells (SMELLS) of fish and seaweed when you walk in...not exactly the kind of thing you want to smell when you stop by for a quick frozen treat.<//text>

<Text>I love cherry on top!  I know what you're saying, isn't this just like those other places with frozen yogurt? Well, to those with a sense of adventure, you will be rewarded with a great selection of frozen yumminess.  The flavor profile of the different yogurts are brighter, more fresh and are not the candified version of the flavor and if you don't believe me try the green apple and you will know what I mean.  Oh and toppings? All the toppings. This, unfortunately, leads me to my criticism. There are so many wonderful, delicious ways to top your yogurt, you're going to to be paralyzed with choice. The only solution is to get four of the largest size and go nuts. Or brownies. Or gummy bears.</Text>< name>

< Review>
This place is SOOOOOO good. Omg I'm sad that there is none where I live since I was visiting LA. Their puffle waffle cone was perfection. I had the earl grey lavender and it was so yummy and smooth. The consistency of the ice cream was spot on. I'm sad that I came back home because I wanted to try their other flavors like the rose one :(. Customer service was great also! The girl who helped me was super friendly. And on top of that, the rose shape on the ice cream was a plus!<//Review>

The sales woman was very nice and helpful,bringing out a another pair I didn't even ask for but fit good, just like the first pair she brought me. I don't remember her name, but she deserves a special mention and recognition!!😇😇<//Review>< pics>

Went to this Macy's for the Memorial weekend sales and snagged a few essentials. Store was primarily organized and well-maintained. Great markdowns!  Only gripe: checkout stations were scarce, had few cashiers, and all had lines.</review>

It's okay. I feel like they're super judgemental because I don't always look like the average happy go lucky customer so no matter what I always get stalked. It quite frustrating especially when I spend so much money here.<//Text>

<text>I've frequented macy's especially this macy's since I was a child. I recently went back was was disappointed on their selection in children's clothing more so in their boys/infant boys clothes. They have way more girl clothing and options and a very limited selection for boys.

I purchased a cologne for my spouse and the representative was a little cold. I believe she didn't think I was going to make a purchase. So she was busy engaging with someone else.

I did as an employee where the elevator was and he kindly escorted me to the elevator. I would give this more stars If they had a better selection on boys clothing and maybe a little more engaging staff.<//text><user_name>J Valencia</user_name>< gmapID>

Always great service at the jewelry counter! Friendly and patient. Not so much at the cosmetics. Was offered something and returned to purchase and told oh no it's gone... Mmm hmm honor what you offer. Bait and switch.< /review>

Macy's is one of the best department stores in the Northridge Mall. They carry a variety of clothes, shoes, and home goods. They're affordable, stylish, and carry plus sizes that fit true to size. I love the accessories section, especially the jewelry department.

The customer service is great love their handbag sales.The shoes are great too and the clothings have a lot of sale now. If you buy worth $50 you have automatic discount of $10 in star rewards in your next purchase which ends in 6/21/19 ( not sure of the date) that's what my star rewards end. I really enjoyed shopping here or just looking in their sales makes me feel happy and makes me stress free i don't need to buy anything just look around and look for all their sales events.<//Text>

<text>I absolutely love this store! Not only in-person but online as well! The staff here are very nice and are extremely helpful. Placed an online order for pick up, had a couple returns to boot, was able to take care of everything in one location! And, while you wait in line, enjoy a coffee from Starbucks conveniently located directly across from the pick up area(yes, in-store!). Really great! I'm definitely a loyal customer and no doubt in the least that I will continue to stay that way.</text></record>

Macy's is open, the rest of the mall is not. I'm not sure if some stores are offering curbside pick up despite not allowing in-store shopping. Usual Macy's offerings. Not a lot of people, no line to get in. Went on a Wednesday afternoon.<//Text>

Cashiers are scarce here! Waited 26 min for cashier to checkout 2 people. Too much talking instead of seeing people waiting. Doubt I will ever go back. Cashier Nany said it was due to coronavirus! WTH??? No!!</Review>

<text>Macy's department store in the Northridge Mall is one of the best locations to find a variety of clothing, shoes, furniture, and home goods. One of my favorite clothing manufacturers is Style and Company and INC. These two brands are affordable, stylish, and carry plus sizes that fit true to size. I love the choices of fashion accessories this location carries, especially the jewelry department. Great! This is the store to go for your next big event without breaking the bank. I love Macy's!!<//text><gmapID>0x80c29b74b5707bbd:0xd46b74365b4582e5</gmapID>< pics>

I can tell they dont care as much anymore. Selection is very low. Aside from perfume,  they dont have anything special anymore. They do have Macy's Backstage for what's it worth</Review>

<Review>Disinterested Staff
Hard to tell who was actually working there and only one of them asked if I need help, for the THREE hours I sorted through a lackluster inventory, of disorganized plus sized clothes, hunting for women's basic dress pants, for work.
Skinny legs is not a professional look.
Pockets have made jsut for show, not functionality. "sits just below natural waist" is neither professional, nor flattering.
Very disappointed.
Had a great selection of holiday apparel, but if one is looking for profession attire, I'd shop elsewhere.</Review><user_id>112315532919204801052</user_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< username>

I like their sales which seem to happen quite often. What I don't like is that there aren't enough chairs to sit in if you are handicap and shopping.

Other than that, it's a great place to buy clothes, shoes and the occasional home item.</Review>< response>

You know Macy's might be a good place to shop, but I'm assuming that they want people who have six figure salaries. Because when you go to buy a suite and find out that the coat is almost $300 and the pants are $160. You start to wonder if you got left in a time paradox. I mean I remember when a suite actually was pants shirt and jacket. 😂<//Text>

It took forever to get a sales rep so I could pick out a watch for my husband. I was struggling to keep my twin boys (4 years old) under control while I waited to be helped. By the time I had chosen one, the sales rep told me that I couldn't even take it home that day. I had to come back the next day to get it, because the price I was paying was to "reserve" the watch at its promo price. I was so bothered. If I had the time to come back to the mall, I would not have chosen to buy the watch right then and there. I would not have endured about half an hour of trying to keep my kids calm. She was super indifferent when I was disappointed and didn't even bother to offer me a different, comparable watch. I just walked away. If you have kids, do yourself a favor and buy online. The sales on the Macy's website are the same. Struggle free.</text>

<text>A silly amount of time to wait to buy a pair of jeans. Spotted another staff member near by that didn’t bother to open up another till or assist the staff member that had a long queue and even longer wait times.

The store has changed a lot over the last few years.  They added a section called Backstage with discounted items. That area gives a vibe like Ross, Marshall type of store. Everything is either under $20 or $40. I haven't seen that in any other store. The store was clean. Nonetheless it's no where close to the Arcadia store that is more welcoming and nicer.</review>

Ceiling has a terribly leak. Maybe not Macy's fault, but it's still happening in their store. Unsafe and not one person offered to help while I walked around.</Review>

It's Macy's, if you've never been to Macy's well.. all I can say it's everything you will expect and nothing will blow you away. Certainly not the prices for the same tired brands and fashions.</Text>

I was looking for stockings that go with a garter belt and a sales associate said knee highs as if those are compatible with a garter belt. They are not compatible. Why do places sell garter belts and not the stockings?< /Text>

<Text>Well it's a open department store and they do appear to be trying to stay in business. They have a wide variety of clothes in there but they aren't designed for Americans. Is clothing made out of various colored foil worn here? All the clothing is also a bill board for the manufacturers. Don't like advertising big logo's and lettering on my clothing. I bought a xxl size flannel shirt and have to wonder xxl what? Infant fresh out of womb? I should post a pic. I don't like the phoney discount pricing and sales. I have an app that auto compares prices on anything and Macy's was cheaper then no one on anything. And that's with all the tricks and discount offers. It's mall store pricing so not much of a shock. Never was able to find a pair of shoes I liked that fit. I only shop here when someone gives me a gift card.
They need to fix the pricing. They need more electronics. They need someone with fashion sense to stock the clothes they sell. The staff was ok. The furniture selection was terrible. They should veer away from selling it. They have a few toasters and latte makers and a good jewelry variety. Most of it sold out. They are making obvious mistakes but theyre still in the game. I wish them luck.<//Text><Rate>3< /Rate><Time>1577517842874< /Time></record></dataset><record>

I visited the cosmetics shop had an amazing experience provided by Victor in Lancome.
Too bad his supervisor reprimanded him for being too nice . I would like to come back to the store but with management like that I think I'll take my business elsewhere.<//Review>

DONT EVEN BOTHER BUYING BED SHEETS ANYWHERE ELSE :) No matter what, been there and tried that. I shop there bedding, linens, curtains & home items on super clearance online and then do free pick up in store. Never forget to use there online coupons!!  I get VERY high quality for super cheap prices!! Renovating and redecorating on a budget! LOVE MACYS and they have the BEST customer service in USA</Text>

<review>Ordered cosmetics online, and they offered 2 really good sample products. Was happy with both what I ordered and received as samples. Items were delivered separately which I felt like is a waste of packaging, but the cream I actually ordered arrived in 4 days, standard shipping.<//review>< Pics>

I would say the Macy's at this mall is just fine the selection of clothes are okay at best nothing that I really care for to be honest with you at least the clothes aren't all over the place so that's kind of nice that they kind of keep it up at least the people there seeing nice to a fault they'll help you out here and there and at least it's not a very long line at this place very often so I do appreciate that very much</Text>

Be careful. Advertised "one day sale" but nothing in store was on sale except an occasional item. We came for a.big deal and ended up paying full price. Suppose that's what they had in mind? No. Macy's wouldn't do that. They aren't struggling against Amazon. Right? Wait. What's wrong here?<//Text>

<Text>The clothes is such a rip off and it looks ugly. The price for one simple summer dress was $128.00. Go to the Macy's in Sherman Oaks the staff is nicer and the clothes is much cheaper. I got a cute dress in the other Macy's in Sherman Oaks for $35 dollars.<//Text>< user_id>

Still a nice, classy department store to shop. Hard to find a sales associate if you have questions. They're elusive and don't make eye contact.<//Review>

I truly love my Patricia Nash purse which I purchased at Macy's. But, not long after my purchase the clasp broke. I tried contacting P.N. via email to no avail. Today, (1/15/19) close to closing; I was at Macy's for another reason and happened to mention to the saleslady my situation with the purse's clasp. Never did I dream, they would exchange it. WOW, such helpful and informative ee's.
Don't know what's going on but "I LIKE IT"! FABULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE!<//Review>

A kind manager helped us out by escorting us to an empty mobile checkout stand and helped complete our transaction.
She said no one leaves the store dissatisfied.

What the heck Macy's. I walked all around the men's department, and no floor sales associate around. I even tried on a few pair of pants, nothing. I asked a sales employee for assisstance. He told me, this is not his department and he was busy. This is the slow, nonchalant service you will receive at this Macy's<//text>

I was speaking in Tagalog then the woman starts treating me badly, I patiently wait for her when she's done with her customer. Then my card won't work, she was like I'm ruining the machine. Didn't t even say thank you to me after I bought an expensive watch for male at second floor.<//review>

I really enjoy this store! They are organized and professional. I had one issue lately, waiting to try on some watches. Nobody was around, then I was approached by an assoicate named Karmin Pereria. She greeted me with patience, understanding, and a true sales person. She was able to get me the specialist for the watch department quickly and I was able to make my purchase.< /review>

The Sales Associates at the Perfume were Amazing. But the Under Cover Security on the 3rd Floor is Obvious and a Bit Insulting. The Way they Watch You and Stare makes You just wanna Leave and Not Shop.<//text>

Be sure to read all sale signs! I found an old sale sign for an item I was purchasing that an employee had forgotten to take down. I simply brought the sign with me to the register, which saved me an additional $20!<//Review>

Bare Minerals counter. Went to get my makeup done. I Always purchase makeup when I have someone do mine. This girl did my makeup then proceeded to tell me "You have to buy the products I used" wow!
I told her I wanted to purchase the cream she used on me, to which she replied "You have to buy more" I was so shocked. She said" Your total has to be more than $65.00."
Not wanting to cause a scene, I purchased another product. I will never ever buy from this place again!
The makeup artist said she has worked there a month. Please someone intervene and teach her better customer service<//Text>

<text>Bare Minerals counter. Went to get my makeup done. I Always purchase makeup when I have someone do mine. This girl did my makeup then proceeded to tell me "You have to buy the products I used" wow!
I told her I wanted to purchase the cream she used on me, to which she replied "You have to buy more" I was so shocked. She said" Your total has to be more than $65.00."
Not wanting to cause a scene, I purchased another product. I will never ever buy from this place again!
The makeup artist said she has worked there a month. Please someone intervene and teach her better customer service< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c29b74b5707bbd:0xd46b74365b4582e5< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>I love this Macy's. Very good customer service. I like their cleanliness in every dept. They have everything you can possibly think in terms of clothing, shoes, watches, etc.. Even the restroom is kept clean. But I would not blame them if it wasnt. Some ppl are just to thrashy and inconsiderate, causing more time to get it clean. I like mostly everything, except they have the men's dept on other side of mall. But it's worth it. Gives you incentive to walk thru mall just to get to that dept. Or you can always drive to it. Either way , all their depts are fully stocked and they have great deals almost everyday.</text>< Pictures>

Their housewares department is in a separate building which I find inconvenient. Even so, Macy's offers a variety of the home and personal items I need. Thumbs up for their frequent discounts!<//Text>

I ordered online skillet. I went to the store and pick it up today. When I come home I realized it is band on one side. Next week I will need to drive the store to return. In this case the salesman that took it from the bag and put it in the bag should pay attention. Sorry I ordered it.</Text>

Found everything I needed. Only down side was how the cashier seemed really bothered that I did not apply for a Macy's card. Once I told her no thank you various times her demeanor was very dismissive.</Review>

This Macys store has the most pathetic grumpy miserable old people working the cash registers ,  I think they purposely go slower as the lines get longer , of course they wont open any more registers , I'm talking about the men's department, dreaded returning a shirt I bought the week before , got there early soon as they opened  , there was only one register open with only one person being assisted at the counter already , the clerk asked me if i had a return , I said "yes" told me to go to the home goods department because that's where all the returns go , I said ok but where is it ? He couldn't tell me where it was at , so when he was done with his customer he said he could do the return there , granted there's no one else in line ,he  complained the whole time how im suppose to take the returns over to home goods , this guy was hard to understand  , old and looked like he hated his job ..the worst customer service I ever had ,  I believe in helping our seniors but not if there going to cop an attitude for doing there job.<//text>

I hate that this Macy's has a completely separate store for the men's section. On the other side of the mall by sears. There are no signs, nothing to direct you. Extremely annoying. They lost my business.< /Text>

Average rating, Macy's in general at this location is okay. But I am posting strictly in behalf of Clinique's booth , discrimination at its best. The lady's there as soon as I arrived, to purchase my regular foundation ignored me,  and wanted to attend all the older caucasian women. I was ignored until I  directly, and forcefully made her sell me a foundation.  I was discriminated because I don't go off flaunting my money in a materialistic matter,  I went in wearing comfy clothes, hair in a bun, cash on hand, and with kids that are not mine which that is not the point. The latina older lady saw me as a poor,  young, latina with a bunch of kids. I was not there to give her an explanation of my current status,  but I hope that companies begin to train their employees to treat everyone with respect, humbleness, and kindness. If I walked in the store with my husband, on a day that I am not "poor looking", I know I would not be treated that way. The great news is that my regular location in Pasadena my gal treats me like a person,  regardless how I am dress, my age, or my ethic background.< /Review>

Waited 15 min at counter to try a watch. The only salesperson around was with another customer, and she didn't have keys for this area. No one else came to help, so I left. This is disgraceful customer service on Macy's.<//Review>

Amongst the few Macy locations that I have had the chance to visit, this one wasn't too impressive. For me when shopping with my mother, I have no interest in shopping at Macys besides the watches and cologne. Unless it's christmas time. But the seating area near the fitting room is quite uncomfy and the t.v. is old school. Not my favorite macy of them all. Sorry!! :( Quite stuffy too.< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Good service. The only drawback is not being able to use the changing rooms, they are closed, due to the pandemic, this causes one to bring clothes home blindly, without knowing if it is going to fit one.
If they sell clothes, they must find a way to send the customer home, to their satisfaction.
Returning to the store for a size change is a nuisance event.

(Original)
Buen servicio. El único inconveniente, es no poder usar los probadores, se encuentran cerrados, por la pandemia, esto hace que uno se traiga la ropa a casa a ciegas, sin saber si le va a quedar a gusto de uno.
Si ellos venden ropa, deben buscar la manera de mandar al cliente a casa , a su entera satisfacción.
El regresar a la tienda por un cambio de talla, eso sí es un evento molestia.</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) They need more employees in the shoe store instead of having them all in the perfumery. I don't know how their employee system works but it was a disaster in the shoes, the employees do what they can to serve so many customers waiting to try their size.

(Original)
Necesitan mas empleados en la zapateria en lugar de tenerlos a todos en perfumería. No se como funciona su sistema de empleados pero era un desastre en los Zapatos, los empleados hacen lo que pueden para atender a tantos clientes esperando para probar su talla.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) With all the precautions ... but the store is open ... although the shopping center (mall) is closed. They have already opened ..
Excellent atmosphere ... very friendly. Organized. Clean banyos.
Free parking ... it's the Northridge evil.
