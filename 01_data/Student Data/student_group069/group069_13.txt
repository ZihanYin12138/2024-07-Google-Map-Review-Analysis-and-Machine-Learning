<response>None</response><Text>There was a pile (at least 4) of used needles on the waiting room floor in plain sight.... very unsafe and gross. The lady working at the check in desk of the laboratory was extremely rude and unhelpful. Even though I was the only person standing at the counter, she refused to look at me and offer assistance. I had to ask if I was in the right spot to check in, not a big deal having to ask if she didn't notice me, but she definitely saw me and was ignoring me, when I asked she was very short and unpleasant. However, The doctor and nurse were extremely nice and helpful.<//Text>< Pics>

The lab line is always backed up with nurses letting members cut the line if they throw a fit about waiting in line like the rest of us. Having an appointment with the lab is useless. Plan on arriving an hour earlier than your appointment AT LEAST. Also, the nurses holding the line warned us that we shouldn’t come on Mondays or Fridays because those are their busiest days. If that’s so, maybe management should staff appropriately those days to minimize wait times. This happened on Friday, 2/19 2021.</review>

There is no sign for urgent care, all you see is covid testing. We were waiting and waiting and couldn't get through. Horrible signage, don't know where the other reviewer saw good signage. Once inside, everyone was very nice and I got in quickly- saw someone within 20 minutes of checking in. As long as you don't have to deal with the long line, it's a good choice.< /Text>

I have been a Kaiser member for 33 years, this is my second pregnancy but the first time I’ve used the Pasadena location for obgyn. My appointment was at 10:30, I did not see the doctor until after 11:30. I informed them of my severe morning sickness, and they treated me as if I had covid. They rushed my to the Covid testing location, ( test was negative ). The doctor didn’t ask me anything about my pregnancy, and anything I asked her she basically shrugged off. By far my worst experience ever. I wish I could switch back to Dr. Lopez at the Gardena Kaiser obgyn location, he was outstanding my entire 9 months in 2016.</review>

Signs along the driveway were clear and plenty to tell you which line is for COVID testing and which line is for Urgent Care.  Got there right before 9am and was treated at 9:05am. Very pleased with the dr and her medical team. They were cordial, thorough and highly competent.  So grateful to have such excellent service! Hats off to Dr Sandra Montes! After the drive-thru clinic, sat in the car on a parked spot to receive prescriptions!!  Yes, the medicines were delivered to your car by Pharmacy team!!  Appreciate the thoughtful system addresses our needs and safety protection against any possible spread of COVID19.<//Review>< Name>

I have used their Urgent Care twice and both times they did an outstanding job. My non-Kaiser doctor describes Kaiser as an ethical HMO. I would agree with that assessment. They get a lot of patients here, but they were well organized and I was getting urgent medical care within one hour of my arrival both times. I am very glad they are here.<//review>

I got urgent care at this facility, at the main entrance the triage nurse ask me something. I asked I think I have an angina. The guy at the main entrance told me you have corona virus,, and sent me the garage for covid suspicious. Even if I show him my the negative covid test result 5 days ago, he did not listen and send me the garage of covid place. I wait for one hour and 45 min, met the doctor. He checked and said to me you are not covid patient why you are here. I just got upset. Eventually the doctor escort me to inside urgent care facility and I got the right service there. It took total 3 hours and 40 min. Long day. Kaiser should train tight for the triage nurse. It's horrible and unacceptable. Bad day.<//review>

I've been here a couple of times and I would probably choose a different office if possible.

Did I mention the lab staff almost discouraged me from taking a few tests that ended up coming in positive? My doctor had little sympathy and completely disregarded my needs. I didn't want to miss work. This was not a simple stomach ache situation.

Came in a little late? Too bad you're sick. Reschedule or get in line at urgent care.

If it keeps going like this, I might just change HMO.

The facility is clean and nice. Parking is easy and the location is right off the metro. Baldwin Park and West LA have been better to me.<//review>

Terrible experience. Waiting is insane. Upon checking in was told 45 minute wait, turned out 3 (Three) hours. By the time it was our turn, we already forgot why we went there. After 3 hour wait there is another 2 hour wait after X-rays are taken. Ridiculous!< /Review>

Not sure where all the bad reviews are coming from. It’s my experience that I usually can get a same day appointment;  sometimes literally within a couple of hours of call the call center. I always make a point of calling the  appointment center as soon as they open at 7am.
My GP is great, very caring!  I feel she takes the time to listen, she does what it takes to get the correct diagnosis, ordering tests or giving a referral, if needed.
I’ve been coming to this location for 8 years. I’m not crazy about urgent care and try to avoid going, as the wait times can be long.
All in all, this is a good place to come for medical care. When I consider how many people that get treated on a daily basis at this facility, I’m Impressed.<//Review>

Great parking lot. Nurses are easy to talk to and have answered my questions without making me feel like an idiot. Waiting rooms are clean. I haven’t seen any used needles lying around like another person posted. Speedy service.</Text>

<Text>Parking is free. That’s the only pro.

I’ve been to this location and one in Glendale and at both, providers have given me the briefest amount of attention and rushed me out. My primary care doc is always late and I’m lucky if I get 10 minutes with her.

They’ve got one X-ray machine for two urgent cares and all the other doctors in the building. I waited for 90 minutes once and that was with a STAT order.

The physical therapy department is a joke. You get an initial hour assessment at your first visit but if you ever need to go back for another problem, you don’t get another full assessment, just 30 minutes. The two PTs I saw there were bored or clueless. I never got any answer as to how I might have gotten tendinitis so I don’t know how to prevent it in the future. I also never got any consensus on what exercises I should avoid so 5 months later, I’m still in pain and now have an appointment with an orthopedist. I’m sure that will be a quality visit...</Text><gmap_id>0x80c2dc9de22ba2c9:0x6b67f00e7b062ec0< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I met with Dr. Ni and she barely checked me and you could tell she didn’t really care and just rushed me out.

Her nurse, Melissa was the worst! As soon as I walked in, she gave me attitude and made me sound dumb. She made very snarky comments and honestly, made me not want to come back.

If this is the staff Kaiser prides themselves in, then I might be having to change insurances because nurses and doctors should be there to help not make you want to never visit the doctors office again.< /text>

Doctor J Ryan in the urgent care literally brought breathe to my lungs again! I woke up the first time and shed a few tears because I could finally breathe! I appreciate him taking the time to literally draw out what was going on to explain his plan to correct it! My fever has finally broken after 6 days, no more extreme body aches and I can actually breathe without sounding like I have emphysema. Thank you doctor Ryan!</text>

Every time I call Kaiser the whole process is inconvenient and frustrating. They don't have the department numbers listed, so I always have to go through a call center. Then when I am transferred, I am put on hold. Today I was on hold for a whole 15 minutes with the patient financial department to get a print out of my co-pays for the year. They were only able to give me part of what I needed, and I had to get through a couple more transfers to talk to the right department to get the rest of what I needed for taxes. On average, I have to be transferred twice to talk to the right person. Please come up with a different system. I get off the frustrated every time I call Kaiser.</review>

Very navigable, full-service Kaiser Permanente medical facility with an urgent care center in suburban Pasadena along Foothill Blvd. The facility is one building with a parking garage. It is extremely easy to access with plentiful and free parking. There is also surface parking spaces closer to the building for handicap accessibility. The facility is also close to a Gold Line Station.<//Text>

The downstairs check in is horrible, set us up with a Dr for our son that isn’t even at this location send us upstairs to the 3rd urgent care waiting over an hour as everyone is just going on past us one by one. Ask one of the nurses and they told us the reason which I stated above. If we didn’t have issues with the check in downstairs in the past I would’ve just let this go but not the first time.<//Text>

I just moved to the aarea a couple months ago so this is my new close Kaiser. Out the 4 times I have been here I have been sent to the wrong area twice....and the wait times are pretty bad.....maybe it's because they are sending people to the wrong areas....also they do not keep this facility up to date....a lot of stains on the carpets and chairs are run down(especially in pediatrics)....I have been to a decent amount of Kaiser facilities and this one just isn't being managed properly it seems like. Also, it really hard to get any kind of appt for working people. You have to take off work to go to any appts which for a full time working parent is really hard...I have sent in a couple complaints to upper MGMT about it hopefully they take a closer look< /Review>< GmapID>

<review>By far the worse Kaiser location I've been too. Receptionists are so rude and cut you off half of your question to tell you to take a number and sit down. Then when you ask a question they make you feel like it's a dumb question, considering this is an urgent care facility they shouldn't be making people feel this way. Then you have to wait about 15 mins just to get called for check in. The wait to see a doctor is about 2-3 hrs.<//review>< Pictures>

During my enployeer's open enrollment season for 2017 benifits selected Kaiser as my family's health plan. This is the first time I ever had Kaiser. So far I'm impressed with the service at the Pasadena location. It was easy getting the labs drawn for our family's annual physical and also picking up my wife's and my percriptions while we were there. While we were there my wife also had her mammogram. Nurses Elena and Jennifer were great. A few weeks later my wife and I went back for follow up. Jennifer recognized our son from our previous visit and spent some time talking to him. A week later I had to go to the nurse clinic for an eat wash Alexa explained everything and got the excess wax out. I can hear much better. Good job Alexa. All in all I had three great experiences so far.</Review>

I've been taking a specific medicine for years. From the manufacturersame point of view   this medicine shouldn't be  a problem. As with other users using the same  medication reported on many forums. Kids have no issues? Hmm. Before this medication was purchased by a US corporation with a manufacturing company now in Glendale. I find it peculiar  that the meds seem to be  not as affective  prior to switching. Since then Ive experienced a slower metabolism weight gain in the abdomen. YET I'M NOT A DIABETIC? CURIOUS these things resemble effects from other medications according  to online resources. To include a "hump like buffalo"  posture specific to the neck area.  Last year I tested the same medications using a droplet liquid test the results were not  consistent with whatever it should be. They either turned completely black or purple suggesting opiods mdma. These capsules are harder densities may differ subtle difference between the before and after switch are curious as well.   This is really ackward to me. These meds give me the munchies and create a lot of resistance in performance. Which they should not be. Research yes I'll continue to research and report updates to this very peculiar situation.

<review>I had an appointment on June 17th and was contacted late Friday June 24th to set up a phone call with the MD at her earliest availability, Tuesday June 28th, between 1-2 pm to discuss the test results.  I planned my day acordingly and cancelled an important meeting to be available.  I received two text messages reminding me of this appointment date and time.  I missed the call that was made at 244 pm, with no second attempt to call back, no number to call back and no information other than a voicemail message that I should set up another appointment. Very frustrating and not what I have come to expect from Kaiser.</review><Time>1467153392253< /Time><Rate>1</Rate>< user_name>

So close to home. Love the one-stop shop aspect too...with more in depth medical issues I go to the Sunset location and even that is painless.<//Text>

< Review>
OMG!!! That is so wonderful to hear Ive been in Pasadena about 2 years and my son has hurt himself at home and has been sick in that last couple of days and we have to continue to go to Huntington Hospital which is a beautiful facility but get the medical insurance transferred is a lot of unnecessary work.</Review>

There should be a place on the website or somewhere that provides real-time wait times or a direct phone number to Urgent Care to get that information.< /text>

<response>None</response><review>I spent almost four hours there last night.  In those four hours I received a ten minute breathing treatment, a ten minute x-ray and was seen by the "urgent care" doctor for about ten minutes.
If only I'd brought my copy of Middlemarch.  The doctor called me today to inform me that I may have pneumonia and that anti-biotics have been prescribed.</review><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x80c2dc9de22ba2c9:0x6b67f00e7b062ec0</GmapID>< user_id>

Do these people ever answer their phone calls to make an appointment. Called for two days straight and have been on hold for over 45 minutes.
What is going on here????<//Review>

<text>These people are the greatest. They're always friendly even when they're a little overwhelmed. There's rarely a long wait, and they help with other services as well like registering you for Cal-Fresh (Food Stamps). They almost always give a pretty large amount of food and this usually includes some kind of gourmet baked goods.</text>< Pics>

They used to be a big help
month but since they moved and only have one day a month for everyone to go at the same time In a ridiculous line or on a day I  can not make it they are no longer an option. So we go hungry more now.  You really screwed a good thing CC. DONT BE SO QUICK TO PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK. YOURE NOT AS MUCH HELP AS YOU WERE TO MANY PEOLE.</Text>

So kind.  They went out of their way to help my friend and me.  They gave me a new bed for my dog.  Who, by the way, loves it.  He sleeps on "his side of the bed."  Except when I go out, he lays on it at the front door.</text>

One of my guilty pleasures. Definitely a splurge, but the coffee is absolutely worth it. Never had a bad cup here. I always buy extra if I know I’m going away for a while .< /Text>

<review>(Formerly Taylor Maid) Same great coffee, new name.  They have room enough on the front patio rhat you can meet a driend for coffee and still maintain physical distancing.  Staff are friendly & courteous.  I didn't buy any bean this time, I just had a large mocha, but the coffee tastes as good as it ever did.  I highly recommend this local business!</review><resp>{'time': 1596589481503, 'text': 'Hi Chip. We really appreciate you taking the time to review our coffee shop.

Second time we've visited here (from SF). Had a cappuccino last time and a golden milk (i.e. turmeric) latte this time, just to fit in with the hipster kids. Both drinks were delicious, and service is on point. They do 6oz cappuccinos which is unusual, and very welcome in a world of oversized drinks. Really nice aesthetics, cute loft area. Definitely the place to go for coffee in Sebastopol.</Text>

I love this place. LOTS of indoor/outdoor seating, even when it is very busy you can always find a spot to sit. Great place to meet with others or do computer work (lots of outlets). The coffee is great. Local pasteries and usually have delicious gluten free and vegan options, too. Service is excellent! I come here often and I have never been disappointed.<//Review>

The best possible place to drink coffee in Sonoma county.
A very relaxed atmosphere, eclectic  music selection,  a downstairs/outside patio and an upstairs area with long tables to study or get extra work done with friends and colleagues.  This is a place to make new friends/network. Plus you can't go wrong with any of their drinks. But careful. The coffee is strong ;)</Text>

Great coffee. Top notch. Brilliant service - actually some of the best service I've ever experienced. I'm not going to write out a long and descriptive explanatory monologue about what happened when I was there I'm just going to say I worked for a long time somewhere similar and this place is top notch with 9.5/10 quality 10/10 customer service 10/10 speed and convenience.

Thank you for the great experience!</Review>

My wife and I just love Taylor Maid and their organic coffee.   It can be difficult to find a good Cappuccino,  but they do it right.  The atmosphere is relaxing and inviting.  We also use there Organic Goat Rock Roast at home,  which is fantastic. I like to use a French press.<//text>

It's a great location with an amazing staff. The folks that work here know their coffee, and love to talk about what they do. Have a coffee question, no worries, they're happy to answer it for you. The shop is big, bright and air. Plenty of seating in this two story church of the bean.< /Review>

Great coffee, nice location. My favorite is a quad shot latte with lavender syrup. It's seasonal...which is a little sad. Edit 2018: Lavender lattes are available all the time now!< /Text>

If you love coffee, check this place out.  Full coffee bar and of course, you can buy any of the beans there.  It was a nice hip, upscale coffee house.  Really enjoyed the flavor of their brands.< /review>

This probably as good a place to find coffee as you're going to find in the North Bay. It's in the Barlow Center, just down the street from the Rialto Cinema and, beyond that, Whole Foods. There is parking but I'm noticing it is not as plentiful as it was, even not that long ago. WiFi is available and decent. It has baked goodies but few are vegan. Also, if you want a pour-over (my own preference), try to get your order in before 2 pm.<//Text>

<review>I came the other day and decided to come back because it was good, quality coffee. This time however, me being the completely clumsy person that I am, I dropped my coffee and busted it all over the sidewalk outside of the door. I actually wanted to die if embarrassment. Everyone clearly saw me because there was an on cue "ahhhh!" from everyone within earshot. So I go back in to buy a new one and a sweet couple that happened to saw my ever so graceful drop offered to buy me a new one. When the ladies working heard I dropped it, they piped in and said they had me covered. It was so sweet and heartwarming that I felt obligated to share. Thank you Taylor Maid Farms for hiring on such an amazing staff!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80843a0a6d79eb91:0xc0e92917442b9b84</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Even though Taylor Maid Farms was recently purchased, this coffee bar brews some of the most consistently good coffee here in Sonoma County.

If you're interested in fine coffees brewed well, you can do a lot worse than here.< /Text>< pictures>

I know cheaper places with eqaul romantic, artistic, homey settings that's are great for writing, but it's more local in my area.

<time>1512979957900</time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>A typical neighborhood bar with nothing fancy about it, but I wouldn't use the term "dive bar" to describe the place.  It's not shady or scary, just simple and basic. The people who work here are great and the local patrons are generally friendly.  Lots of TVs for watching sports, pool tables, dart boards and a juke box with great selections.  Tucked away in the corner of the shopping center, you'll miss the front door if you blink while driving past.  Once you get inside, the bar is huge.  A great place for a beer with your buddies!<//Text>< Pictures>

This local bar is the goods,  They definitely appreciate the customers that walk in the door, be it a regular or a newbie like me. Which is very cool and hard to find. The Bartender was Beautiful and wore a killer hundreds. She is a pleasure to hangout with. And Joe is an alright Barback, he opens a good bottle or two without spillage sometimes.<//Review>

<text>The Bar: Located in the southwest corner of a shopping center on Warner Ave. & Magnolia Ave. It is way back there so look hard for it. The sign for the bar is merely a banner attached to the roof. There is a neon sign that says "open" that you can see from anywhere in the parking lot. On the outside, there are a lot of pictures and newspaper clipping from the prohibition era. There is a TV outside, so that you can keep an eye on the game while you have a smoke. Inside, to the left are 6 electronic dart boards, to the right, a boxing game, which personally, i think it's a bad idea amongst drunk people, but whatever. Straight ahead, you'll find 2 pool tables, along with the bar.
The Crowd: Crowd was good tonight. Not terribly busy, which made it easy to maneuver around the inside. Most everyone was focused on a game or some sort, either darts or pool.
Service: Our beer-tender this evening was Dee. Service was excellent, and she was open to questions about the bar.
Prices: $10.75 domestic pitchers, $8.75 during happy hour. Import pitchers run you anywhere from $11.75-$17.75, which seems a little ridiculous. $3.75 Coors Light bottles, and even though this a beer & wine only bar, they do have (low percentage) $1 Jello shots.
Entertainment: Touch Tunes jukebox, 6 electronic dart boards, 2 pool tables, 1 boxing game, 1 golf game.
Restroom: Mens, Less then fabulous, Womens, was told, it was clean, was also told that I must mention there is a full length mirror inside.
Bartender Chat: Dee was cool, we chatted for a minute about prices, ect.
Closing statement: Not my first time in, certainly not my last. Had a good time, with good people. Plan to be back on April 6th, 2013 for the Stumble Inn Poker Run.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

< Review>
I love the doughnuts here, are they the best doughnuts in San Bernardino? Yes they are. They have a huge variety of things to eat from sandwiches to fried chicken. The prices are good and you won't find friendlier people working in a doughnut shop anyplace. So if you find yourself up on E Street and Marshall make time for a visit and treat yourself don't cheat yourself.<//Review>

It could use a remodel, but it's always been a great place to get a treat or a good breakfast sandwich before your commute. Super convenient for anyone using the park and ride.</Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Donuts taste fresh everytime I order from them. Cream puffs are really good and decently priced. Other breakfast items are also available and are made to order. Boba could be better, kind of on the bland side. The few cons are the area is a on the shady side. They also charge a $0.50 surcharge for debt, but it's understandable since it's a small shop< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The place was clean and tidy and the worker was friendly and helpful and not over bearing. I was given a free donut to go with the cup of coffee I had purchased. Also I think that the prices where reasonable.</Text>

Although this place is a hole in the wall donut shop, the quality of food is excellent. I orde the family pack of chicken and it's always super flavorful with crispy skin. Way better than popeyes!! And it comes with fries and coleslaw and rolls  They make it fresh for you every time, so you have to call 20 minutes ahead to order it. I also highly recommend the Italian sub.<//Text>

Older building but looks can be deceiving here. Although not in the best neighborhood I highly recommend giving this place a try. It's not just donuts and ice cream. The food is delicious and the staff is wonderful. Go get something to eat at Marshall Doughnuts. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>

YES, TODAY SHIN'S IS REOPENED. HEADING DOWN AT 4:45. Have missed Shin and his sushi for a couple of months now. Next to the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Shin's is excellent.

Excellent sushi and rolls. Very traditional style featuring good fresh fish. Don't come here if you're looking for "American" style rolls, you'd be missing the point.< /Review>

<Review>I’m new to the area, saw 4.9 stars and was super excited to eat here. Almost no cooked food menu, $18.00 Mixed tempura... sure, why not? Oops, that wasn’t worth $8.00. Miso was typical, $3.00 bowl of rice that tasted like cardboard, but had a decent consistency. Sushi was typical, not great, but fine. $8.00 for a Japanese Scallop that was the best thing I tried, but not good enough to order again. The finishing touch was a salmon skin hand roll that wasn’t crispy and the salmon skin was cold. I assume this was cooked in advance and put in the countertop cooling system. The place was pretty busy and most appeared to be known to the waitress. Waitress was nice, sweet and works very efficiently. I spent $71.00 trying different things by myself and I have to say my wife was the lucky one because she stayed home.<//Review>< user_name>

< Review>
Run away!!! This company and their delivery company totally suck!!!! After we bought a dinning table and 6 dinning chairs. We set up a delivery for the following Tuesday in the store. We tried to call them to reschedule to Monday since we had something came up on Tuesday after we got home. The store manager said we have to pay $169 to reschedule. So we canceled our appointment and waited at home on Tuesday then they told us they got flat tire and they will come in on Thursday. On Thursday, they brought a dinning table with a lot of stains and scretch. So we told them we can’t accept it. They said we can use it for now, they will replace it on Saturday. We waited a whole day at home on saturday and nobody even showed up!!<//Review>

Talk about bad employees in the world, am I right ? I got kicked out of the store for NO reason or maybe bc I was sitting on the couch for "too" long. I am moving in this new place next week, I wanna make sure that my money is well spent but instead they were so rude to me. For real never entering that store again in my life. They don't know the definition of the statement " the costumers are always right." I was even so nice, minding my own business, testing out some furniture for my new place and out of nowhere the employees started attacking me and arguing me and calling ME rude. Ugh. Whatever terrible place and terrible furniture anyway.< /text>

<review>The good: Love the staff here as well as the prices.

The bad: I purchased $2,400 worth of furniture from Urban Home upon moving to California. Two pieces of the set ended up on back order. I was given a window of 4 to 6 weeks for delivery. It is week 10 now and the company is refusing to provide the furniture I paid for or give a refund for the set. Their customer service, while great at the store, falls apart once you get to corporate. The ultimate escalation is a General Manager's voicemail (which is full).

This is the American Apparel of furniture- great people, good prices and ok product with leadership that is disconnected from their customers and struggling with their operations.

My suggestion: Buy your tchotchkes here but skip the furniture.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>109584375564756451684< /UserId.><Time>1454998346817<//Time>< Rating>

<text>The Greyhound Bus Station is located inside the Chevron gas station. There is not an identifying sign at all for the bus. They only take cash which is difficult for travelers and there is only two benches on the side of the gas station to wait for the bus. It would be better if the benches were covered from the wet times like today. Disappointed.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Always crowded and staff if often lacking in any type of customer service training.  Food service is closed a lot of the time.<//Review>

First problem was the Bus was 4 hours late, with no explanation whatsoever. There was a passenger that fell into a diabetic insulin shock. Causing a further 2 hour setback. I got off the Bus in Chico, after talking with the driver how long we would be there. He said 20 minutes. I said "Long enough to go to the bathroom ? " He said "Yes", so I left for a quick step into the bathroom.  I returned within 2 minutes, and the bus was gone.

I called Greyhound, no help. I called Chico station (it was 2:30 pm) no help.

I called Sacramento station, no help. I spent the night in a wooded Park in the center of Chico city.,

My luggage is all fully marked and locked.  I lost 4 cell phones, 4 chargers, 6 movies (DVDs), portable DVD player.

Every stitch of clothing I owned, 2 $35.00 Flashlights, tools (Pocket versions). Over $200.00 in tourist's junk from Weed, Ca. And haven't yet heard from Greyhound. I will never allow my name or business to cross that path again< /review>

It's a decent bus station if you have somebody waiting for you so you can wait for the bus. It's just a little office behind a convenience store to purchase tickets. Not really a bus depot at all. More like a bus stop. But that's all we got here so it's all good.< /text>

No seating besides one bench, they don't have a bag check in so you have to check your bag at the side of the bus. Besides that it's an alright bus stop nothing super special.</review>

The people in the gas store are really friendly. Greyhound is really hard to predict exactly what  time they will be there.  So many delays they have. It sucks how you have to stand and wait for the bus to get there.  They will not wait for you if youre not there.<//text>

It was a night mare. Abandoned from 10:15pm. We are closing . Go over to the parking lot and wait. The bus greyhound will pick you up there. Try ed too call every telephone numbers and no answer.   I am 76 years old and it was dark.and i got scared and called the sheriff. "IIt's around 2 am , I advise you to leave the area. Will check it out." Went to the sheriff station.  The clerk said, the bus bye passed the pick up at Red Bluff, California to make up time.
What kind of contract do these things. Went the next morning to see about the ticket. Was told the ticket I had was no good and would have to purchase another. I was stunned. I started shaking and my sister took my arm and get me to the car. My nerves were really shaking.  My nice Amy got me and air plane ticket back to home. Kennewick Wa<//Text>

Wow honestly the best cup of coffee I’ve had in a while! The barista really knows how to work with non-dairy milks and the espresso they use is very flavorful. I got a soy cap and my bf got an oat latte and both were insanely good! I’m excited to see what vegan gelatos they offer in the future.<//review>

<Text>NEW OWNERSHIP! as of 4/19 and the coffee is back to A game level.

The girls behind the counter never seem to have patience, even when there’s no other customers in the store. The impatience today and lack of customer service caused an allergic reaction because they couldn’t be bothered to know ingredients in the products and said something was gluten free when it wasn’t.
There needs to be allergen info for the products and actual customer service.</text>

I loved this place! Service was wonderful & friendly, & the gelato was amazing. They really do have more unique flavors here than the other gelato places I've been to.
I got a scoop of the Thai tea (w/ pieces of boba) gelato with coconut sorbet (w/ some pieces of shredded coconut) & a cookie straw/wafer. They were a great combo together. I'm glad you're just given a cute little shovel/spoon to eat the gelato with, because I couldn't put it down until it was finished.
My boyfriend got one of the little espresso drinks. It tasted like a really smooth light brew (to us at least), but even though he doesn't like light brews he liked this drink.
For the gelato, I definitely recommend tasting the flavors before you get them though, the one flavor that sounded nice to me but tasted so-so was the Matcha Lavender. It looks nice, but tastes like what lavender smells like.</text>

I loveee the Flavors available.There's such a good variety I love them all. However my favorite is the durian Gelato Bar & Espresso Cafe. All the gelatos are freshly made and theirs a creamy consistency. The location is kind of a small and hidden place but still nice.<//text>

I stumbled in here because I needed a quiet place to write and was pleasantly surprised. Quaint from the outside and even moreso on the inside, you'll find ample coffee options and locally made, all natural gelato of the best quality. Helpful and genuinely friendly staff add to the charm of this little coffee shop.< /text>

Loved their customer service. They use a local gelato maker and keep everything local. Both conventional and exotic flavors are fun to try and worth a sample. Cozy and cute, will definitely be coming here again.<//Review></record>

<review>In love with this cute Gelato bar. It's a perfect place to "cheat" but still not have any dairy. It's located on the cutest part of Tujunga, in Toluca Lake. There are shops, a spa, a little theater and a cafe in this adorable neighborhood hangout.

The gelato is delicious and most of the staff is awesome. Although there have been a couple of times where it's been obvious that the servers are no happy to be there. If I was the owner/manager I would make sure the staff up front are giving off a welcoming vibe just like the decor and ambiance of the actual Gelato Bar.</review>< pics>

It's okay here but too expensive for no reason. Over $6 for a Mocha? Why? There's a reason why Aroma Cafe next door is always crowded and not here. Align your price to the scale and the location of your shop and you'll get 2 other stars from me.<//Text>

When you change addresses in order to live closer to a coffee shop it just has to be good.
Very accommodating staff, fast coffee and just the way one likes it, broad range of snacks and gelato.
There may be other “be-seen” coffee/bakery places on the street, but I’d rather have a laugh with the staff, the best gelato around, and a perfect cuppa in my hand in minutes - not 45 minutes.<//Text>

People have been assuring me that Gelato & Espresso Bar has the best brew in Studio City... maybe in the SFV.
The locals tell me to avoid the bigger cafes on the street.
Today proved them all right.

Kate  and Esmer were on duty today . My daughter in from New York and I strolled in to sample the gelato & have a morning coffee.
The French roast was brewed by hand and served in a glass pitcher. Aside from lovely staging the coffee was amazing.

This is no longer just a stop for gelato that rivals the recipe in Rome. The cafe menu offers coffee teas and small bites such as paninis.

Why wait in a long line up the street for a mediocre coffee  ?
The layout is charming and the gelato menu offers many dairy free vegan options..
Wow easy parking on the streets ....give this little local gem a visit!!!< /text>

This is a great little espresso and gelato cafe.  Housed in a quaint area with an eclectic array of other one of a kind little shops and restaurants.  The coffee, gelato and service is wonderful.  I've never been to Italy, but this establishment is what I would envision a small corner Italian cafe would look like.  I highly recommend a visit whenever you are in the Studio City area.</Text>

The ice cream is great the service was awful the two females who were working there are very rude they gave me my icecream so nasty looking. But when it came to a white male behind me they serve his icecream perfect. I will never go back here or to studio city. Studio city is full of racist people.< /Review>

<Review>The gelato here is outstanding.  Love the range of changing flavors.  The Bambini is he perfect size.  You get two flavors and it's just enough gelato to get your fill.  Coffee here is pretty decent as well.  There is also an assortment of muffins, breads, scones and cookies.  They also have sandwiches though we have yet to try any of them.  Don't forget to ask for a frequent buyers card.  After 12 or so visits you get something for free.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Gelato how I love thee. You're sweet and creamy and satisfy my need for a splendid treat. My beau and I stopped in this past Sunday and ordered a variety of gelato and an amazing homemade poptart on the side. The place itself is very cute and quaint - located on Tujunga in Studio City amongst all the little cafes, shops and restaurants. The staff was friendly and we found nearby parking in the neighborhood up the street. We tried the Striaccella (which took me back to my Europe days), Amaretto and Salted Caramel - all were beyond tasty, light and refreshing.
The homemade poptart was the equivalent of apple pie in a tart form, highly recommended!< /Text>

Always loved to take our vehicles here. They were very professional and did a great job. But when you point out something they missed or ignored they get very upset and will not correct their mistakes. Took my wife's car in and found a spot that I could not rub out.  Ask them if they could do something and the manager said it wasn't their problem and would not do anything. Finally got them to remove the spot but after a very long and heated argument with them. Just another example of people not taking responsibility for their own actions. Never going back. Shame, they use to do great work.</Text>

<review>Paid $65 for the wash and wax for my jeep wrangler.  First of all,  it was shiny and beautiful.  Then I noticed that there was thick mud on the exposed inside of the front bumper on the right side and inside of wheel wells still dirty.    Some sand still inside and dirty spots around the doors. I guess the good thing is that I've decided it will be better to just buy all the stuff and do it myself.</review>< userid>

I have been looking for a good place to get my car cleaned and to be honest have been let down in the past. When I came into Town and Country Car Wash I was thinking I hope this Car Wash is good. Not a single time have I been disappointed in my times of going in. All of the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. My car was cleaned very nicely and was shining all around. It reminded me of when I bought it, new car clean. I want to thank everyone at Town and Country Car Wash for the exceptional work that you all do. I will definitely be coming back regularly.</Text>

Well I've been there many times, but on Thursday morning the clerk inside was so rude. I asked her a few questions and her response her tone.She was not like the other girls.when my vehicle was ready she called it out at least six times, I made eye contact with her on the second call out but she continued even though there were only three people inside me one of them.I told the other people joking, I looked at them and said good God I must be blocking traffic. Please find kinder people, she's not representing your company very well.</text>

Great car wash. AWFUL detailing. We paid $235 for a “detail” and got a ton of Armor All all over our leather seats and the STEERING WHEEL! the windows have Armor All all over them and even the exterior had Armor All prints all over. The paint is just as dull and swirly as it was when we brought it in. I had to go through and wipe all the excessive Armor All off all the seats, steering wheel and brake pedals. It was dangerous, to drive otherwise. I feel like we got a $200 car wash with $35 worth of Armor All and a spray wax. Very disappointed and will NOT recommend them to anyone else. I gave it a one star because there is not a zero star option. #SHINYISNOTCLEAN!!<//Review>

Miguel at the front entrance is very detailed, honest and very helpful whenever I'd go in to drop off all of my customers' vehicle for a complete wash / vacuum and details. He has great communications at each and every time! He is a great asset to the car wash business without a doubt!! And I highly recommended him to anyone looking to have their vehicle wash anytime of the week!<//text>

<Text>We just bought a car and I wanted to get it cleaned. I was told it would take 45 minutes for them to start and finish the services on my vehicle. I waited at least twice that amount and was offered no refund or compensation for the trouble. The inside of my car was soaked with some sort of oil that ended up all over my hands. They also did not vacuum the armrest so it so it was still coated with hair. There were still things left on the floorboard (that weren't there before)

$50 and almost 2 hours wasted.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1525726067915, 'text': "Jessica, I'm so sorry to hear about your experience, and I wish you had talked to us about how your car was left while you were still here so we could fix it immediately.

I've been coming here religiously for 4 years. I've had a hick up here and their but anytime I was not satisfied I brought it to the attention of management and everything was always taken care of.  I always consider that at times it gets busy and sometimes things can be overlooked or maybe someone is in training, but all I have to do is bring it to their attention and they take care of it. They have great employees and the waiting area is very kid friendly. Everyone is very welcoming and polite always. It's by far the best around here and I love the fact that I get a pretty good military discount ;) I will continue to bring my car weekly to be washed.<//Text>

They used to do a good job until i had my vehicle polished. When i got my car home i noticed some drip marks & also the seal on the back passenger side was melted. I called them & the supervisor said to bring it back towards closing time so i did. He tried rubbing it out but it didn't work. Then 1 of the other workers kept interfering in our conversation 1st saying it was in the paint job then he asks if i ever take it through a drive through and i said it's not from that. Then he said the seal melted from the heat. I read up on that & that wouldn't cause that. And especially innjust certain spots. The supervisor then told me he would call back on Monday so we could figure out what to do. That was 2 Monday's ago. I'm sure they think just because I'm a female that i wouldn't do anything further or that i forgot. I haven't forgotten. Really disappointing.  I'll leave it in God's hands & have to forgive them for the way this was handled. Will not be going back there.</Text>

Purchased carpet shampoo service coupon and was charged 70.00 and told it would take 2 hours.  (I see now in the packages carpet shampoo costs 40.00)  When I took the car in they weren't busy and I was told it would only take 1.5 hours.  After 2.5 hours I asked why it was taking so long and was told I should have had someone pick me up and take me elsewhere while they provided this service.  After 3 hours I walked out back and saw they were high pressure hosing the pieces of carpet that are removable from my vehicle so they were just getting around to this.  It took 3.5 hours for this 1.5 to 2 hour service to be completed.  I was very unhappy so they gave me a card for a $20.00 car wash.  A few weeks later I was getting the car washed for my wedding the following day and I thought I shouldn't use this coupon because I didn't think I was going to get good service but since I was pretty broke from wedding expenses I used the coupon.  My car came through the car wash and was wiped down and when I got inside my car it wasn't clean at all.  The windows were covered with water spots as was the vehicle.  I've been coming to this car wash for years and have never seen my car come out like this.  I complained to the guy and was told these were permanent water spots and they had a special cleaning that could be done but other than that the spots were permanent.  I took the guys rag and with a bit of elbow grease wiped a spot clean on the hood to show him the water spots come off.  He was argumentative so I asked for the manager.  They moved my car to the side so customers couldn't see this exchange and the manager came out.  He agreed the car looked terrible and told them to take it in the back and hand wash it.  Twenty minutes later my car was brought out exactly the same.  The spot on the hood that I cleaned was fine and the rest of the car was a mess.  I chalked it up to experience and had the dirtiest car at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina Del Rey that weekend.  This used to be a good car wash....now it's just another rip off.  Gotta go wash my car, it's still covered with water spots.< /Text>

They do a great job BUT when you tell them which package you want, leave it at that.  They will ask you something and phrase it as if you have an option.. "are you ok with the ArmorAll on the inside"...if you say yes, you'll find yourself paying 13.00 more at the register. Misleading "upselling" practice, but like I said,  they do do an awesome job.<//text>

I'm an easy customer and not picky at all, but 60% of the time, my vehicle was not vacuum thoroughly and had to make a complaint when i'm back to pick up my vehicle. Under the four mats are not vacuumed and very sloppy work. I understand that no businesses in the world are perfect and i don't expect it to be for me. I go in randomly for washes throughout the week and notice that this only happened more on a Wednesday and Thursday of the week for me. For the last whole month, i have waited to see who will vacuum my vehicle and remembered each and everyone of them... At last, I finally caught the gentleman who did a sloppy job on all 3 of my vehicles... Heard other employees called him Efrain or Efren or Efran and as he walked past me, i saw a glimpse of his name card to back it up. I have no sympathy for such a lousy, lazy worker taking up a great spot for the ones who really deserved to be there!!!!! I notice that everyone at the front do really work hard, except for this lazy, lousy and sloppy employee that pretend to vacuum my vehicle, but failed to do so!!!!!!!!!!! The owner obviously don't know that he's over paying a guy to do nothing and sit on the clock waiting for a paycheck with little to nothing produced out of him!!!!!!!!!!!! It's time to go try another car wash...and thank you for nothing and what a waste of my money for nothing!!!!!!!!< /Text>< Date>

After taking a look at it even they weren't sure the spots could be buffed out without serious abrasive treatment, but they got it done!  Not only that, but I found out their detailed worked all day to make my car shine.  What a difference!

I'm reading mixed reviews on Yelp, and want to add that the management and staff listened to me and worked really hard to make sure I was happy.<//review>< Pics>

We have taken husband's  truck & my car a few times since this. I am not sure what has happened since, last few times our vehicles have been left with streaks on the window and oil on the bottom. It was taken care of by staff after we asked. My car yesterday  (was not busy) I was the 2nd car in the line, when they finished I walk up I looked at my seat to get in, it was full of dirt. I don't know if when they removed my mat they placed it on my seat. I hope they wouldn't, mats are just too dirty to be placed on seats. I asked staff if we vacuum again?  Staff just wiped it down. I got home my windshield had a streak. I just wiped it down. We don't mind mistakes but I think a look over again (maybe by other staff)before they say it is done. Especially when not as busy as normal, yesterday was the fastest time my car was done in. Just a thought. I will continue to say Staff is always nice & courteous.

I had to ask the guy that did my van about the mats and he said it didn’t say to do them. But he went and did them for me. Plus I had to ask him to clean my cup holders. Also with it suppose to be a mini detail I would think they would have wiped the door kick plates and around the inside of the door are still dirty.

<time>1548352686246<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Normally I've had really good experiences getting my family's vehicles washed here. Definitely NOT today! When I pay $26 to have my car done, I expect it to be clean inside and out. My vents are still dusty, it looks like they barely vacuumed, my center console wasn't even touched. I took a white towel and wiped down the trunk area and it has so much black dust on it I almost have to wonder if their wash is working right and if the guy who wiped/dryed it even tried, not to mention how much dirt/dust I wiped off my rims. I'm seriously disappointed with this place. For what they did, I could've gone through the drive through carwash for $10 and done the rest myself. Again, when I pay $26 for a carwash I don't expect to have to go home and redo what I just paid someone else to do. I'm disabled which is why I go to some place like this to have my car done, but if this is the quality of the carwash I can expect from them, I may as well go back to Red Carpet!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Let me start off by saying that I get that a $20 wash job is not the same as a hand wash. I set my expectations accordingly. But when I pay $20, and come out to a car that still has both copious amounts of dirt AND bird poop (!) on the hood, I get a little upset. Not to mention that I waited an extra 20 minutes while they washed, dried and called the people who arrived after me. And when I finally did politely remind them (sincerely, I was polite), they STILL had not done the tires or trim, even though the sign said that it was included with my package. After waiting for close to an hour, I thanked them, took my car and left—finishing the trim and whatnot myself when I got home.

This has been my second poor experience with Town & Country in a month. I believe that everyone has a bad day and should get at least two opportunities to prove themselves. I gave them their two, and they blew it both times. Needless to say, I will not be back.< /Text>

I'd give this place a negative star if possible. I brought my truck to this carwash to be detailed for my graduation. It was the only vehicle in the vacuum area until a larger truck pulled up. It took them over 30mins to bring it through the wash area and around to be dried. Upon pulling up, I notice I huge dent in my rear bumper and my license plate light was dragging the ground.

I inform the manager of my vehicle damage, he claims it was there before I brought the truck to them. He then proceeded to check their cameras. My truck pulled into the vacuuming area with no damage. But conveniently when the truck was taken around back their cameras were "not working" and by the time the cameras picked it back up 30min later in the front of the carwash, the damage had been done.

He refused to acknowledge the fact that his cameras was kidding vital frames, and he acknowledged that damage had probably been done there. All he offered in compensation was a coupon for another wash.  Terrible businessmen and terrible customer service.</Review>

This place used to be great. When I didn't have time to wash my car by hand I would come here because they did a decent job for a car wash. I don't know if this place has changed ownership in the last six months or what but it has become terrible. Been here for an hour and a half and they are just starting to dry the car. The last couple times I've been here they have done a terrible job< /text>

Horrible experience....they didn't vaccum under car seats and they asked us to unbuckle them. They didn't wipe down the back seat at all. There was trash under the seats because they didn't move them forward when they vaccumed. I looked it the car so I could see how much to tip, but after I opened the door. I was very unhappy. I will not be going back.</review>

Son's DSI XL was stolen from my truck Wed March 13, 2013.  Noticed not 15 min after leaving the car wash and have been given the runarounds since.  I've been bugging them about it and they keep telling me they will investigate or they will call me back or they're busy with cars. Finally I called them this morning,  Fri March 15, 2013 since NOBODY, called me yesterday, and the supposed "MANAGER" was rude and could care less saying there's nothing they can do and I can't expect them to watch the 3 or 4 employee's vacuuming out the interior all the time. Poor customer service! Will never take any of my vehicles there ever!! They took zero responsibility for having thieves working there! Did not try to keep my business at all, not that they could.  Treated me like I was the one with the problem!< /text>

They always have fire weed. And you can't beat the deals either. I usually come and pick up a bulk or for the moment and each time they never fail me on whatever i go with. I recommend nelly and dubb they always got good recommendations and just all around great customer services when im here. Compton cure is the only dispensary ill keep coming too. Only place for me near me.<//Text>< pics>

Nelly always give me the best customer service to me and my daughter whenever we stop by and visit and they always have the best bud and consistency! Their edibles choices are great and their deals for happy hour and daily deals. I always send my friends in and they have the best experience with her partners always.<//Review>

I’ve been here a couple times. The tender Nelly that I’ve gotten served by is alway sweet and helpful, she also put me on to some good edibles. Compton cure is one of the shops near me in Compton... but the only one I go to . Today I picked up flower she recommended so I’ll be trying tonight and see how that goes... usually anything they recommend in all does me really good!</review>

Clean and small dispensary with a wide array of top shelf to exotic flower and a very large selection of different vape pens and carts. Whenever I’m in the area I go out of my way to stop in here. They have some pretty amazing discount days and they hook you up with some pretty sweet first time patient deals. Everyone was masked and distanced, and their patient appreciation day is pretty freaking sweet- definitely returning.</text>

The budtenders here always so helpful everytime I come in for my meds. I love the vip shelf it always gets me the consistency no matter what strain I get. They have the best happy hour special near my area. Which is cool because the whole scenery is safe,  clean and nice. Definitely recommend this shop for different patients that looking for flower, edibles,  vapes etc.<//review>

I looked up on Weedmaps and they popped up with great reviews so decided to check them out 🥴 they had some pretty cool First Time Patient deals (which is great a lot of shops don’t usually have ftp deals) when I entered they had such a welcoming vibe loved all the BTs very friendly but let me tell y’all about their weed 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 the exotics are the BEST ! and the deals that they have sheeshhh 😅 you can’t go wrong I saved so much money! And to top it off they mentioned about a patient appreciation day that happens twice a month man this is definitely my Go to shop now y’all won’t regret it<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Compton cure is a great contribution to our city, Compton ca. My favorite products are cbd related items. The 1:1 thc and cbd products are the best for pain and relaxation. Thank you for being very helpful!</text>

These guys literally raised the price on their wax from 10 to 20$ a gram. 100% increased price for the same crumble. That's great for business<//review>

<review>The flower is good, the wax is awesome, the people are great, but they do not update there Weedmaps menu daily. They just copy and paste. Other than that, I recommend them and I suggest you call first to make sure what they have. But they will get a 5 star if they, honestly, update there menu at least every 4 hours, if not more often.< /review>< Time>

< Review>
Compton cure is the number one cannabis shop in Compton,  ca hands down. They have the best pricing with the best products. A few of my favorites include Madre cartridges (the product is all organic and extracted by the most natural process) kurvana which beats madre in quality but either way I love them both. They always have the best P.A.D deals as well, I mean I bought 2 eights for practically for the price of one. Can't wait for the next one on July 10! Also the customer service is above and beyond! I recommend this shop to all my family and friends. Ooo I forgot to mention the edibles like the standard gummies..  💣 💣 💣</Review>
