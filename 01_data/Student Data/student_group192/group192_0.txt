<Text>We ordered gator and fried chicken meals, and both of them are super good! Especially the gator and fried okra (the side dish) are awesome! If you're an okra lover, it's a must try!!! Definitely will come back next time. P.S. the special hot jelly sauce for fried chicken is soooo delicious.</Text><Rate>5<//Rate><Response>None<//Response><userid>106975819271900293819< /userid><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuhamNulMWhYiEEs9HkKhbgCBr8Ku0kam90Pzh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Name>

Amazing food!! It's not inexpensive, but the quality and quantity certainly justified the price. The gumbo, fried chicken/fish, salmon cakes & grits, and mac & cheese were our favorites. and the peach cobbler is to die for. Also, everyone working here was super sweet and kind. Highly recommend!!< /review>

I ordered the Cluck and Surf. The chicken breast, wing, and catfish were huge. It is bigger than what I'm accustomed to. Well seasoned and crispy. The mac & cheese was perfect and well as the rice. The jalapeno jelly and corn muffin set it off. Everything had a unique taste. I will be back.< /Review>

<Review>I heard about Sweet Blessings on a Be Localish segment on the news.  It's not easy finding good southern style comfort food in L.A.  When I finally stopped by this weekend. I was greeted very nicely. Upon reviewing the menu, I couldn't make up my mind. Everything sounded so good. I asked for a recommendation as it was my first time. A very nice man who worked there advised I could get a salmon/crab cake a la carte and definitely try the gumbo.  So that's what I ordered. And I absolutely had to try the peach/ mango cobbler.
Let me just say that everyone at the restaurant was so nice. I did not wait too long for my order. When I got home and took my food out, it smelled great!
It also tasted Great!  The gumbo was so well seasoned.  It did not have any unnecessary bell peppers which I was so happy about. It was probably the best gumbo I've had in the city.  The salmon/ crab cake was delicious and cooked perfectly.  It had very nice grilled flavor and was a good size portion. It did not come with a sauce, but after the first bite, You don't need a sauce. It stands on it's own.  The cobbler was so yummy. Not too bready or too sweet. Everything tasted incredibly fresh. Made with care. As it should be.  The Blessing is, I finally made it over there.  I will Absolutely go back. I cannot wait to try more items on the menu. I'm so happy I stopped in and I'm so glad that nice man helped me choose what to order. Happy happy Belly!  Probably the best new food to go order experience I have had in months.

I really wanted to like this place,  especially after all the wonderful reviews but I guess it wasn't the day for a good fried chicken dinner!.., lol..., the chicken was good on the outside but was extremely dry.., to a point where I couldn't really enjoy the excellent string beans and mac.  Fried chicken is supposed to be succulent and juicy but not this.   Every piece of my four piece dinner was dry!.., even the thigh!.., not a drop of juice dripped into my mouth after biting into it..., i was extremely disappointed because I wanted to enjoy my $17 plus overpriced meal.< /text>

Love at first bite... I came here with a group of friends and we were all speechless about the chicken here! So delicious and perfect amount of spiciness for me (medium). Fries were seasoned just right as well. The restaurant is pretty small, but we were able to get seats as people were leaving.<//review>

<text>We just finished eating our takeout and it was SO GOOD that I had to write a review! We ordered the 2pc fried chicken platter, chicken & waffles, and got mac & cheese and okra for a side. Everything was seasoned well and had an interesting kick to it which was an extra bonus! Definitely get the mac & cheese as a side and try the pepper jelly with the chicken, but I don't think you'd go wrong with anything here</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c29730c221b9ef:0xbea5344d47e124f8<//gmap_id></record>

The fried catfish is the best I have ever had. The breading is crispy and light, and the catfish has the perfect amount of salt. I also love the fried chicken and jalapeño jelly that comes with the surf and turf<//review>

After having seen this place advertised on our local news station, we added it to our "must try" list. We drove almost an hour (one way) to try this place out, and we were not disappointed! The chicken is juicy, perfectly seasoned, and extra crunchy. The mac and cheese, and the brussel sprouts were amazing. This is a must try!! You will not be disappointed! We will gladly make the 2 hr drive to eat here again!! Well done Sweet Blessings!! Well done!</Text>

I had dinner here prior to going to a show at the Hollywood bowl. Today the food was excellent. I enjoyed the bowl with short ribs and it was outstanding ! As part of diet LA they also gave you a salad and a dessert which was a chocolate Ice Cream taco. My personal opinion was I found the shell of the taco fairly strange but overall the meal was still very good And a fair price for dine LA.</Text>

I heard about Sweet Blessings on a Be Localish segment on the news.  It's not easy finding good southern style comfort food in L.A.  When I finally stopped by this weekend. I was greeted very nicely. Upon reviewing the menu, I couldn't make up my mind. Everything sounded so good. I asked for a recommendation as it was my first time. A very nice man who worked there advised I could get a salmon/crab cake a la carte and definitely try the gumbo.  So that's what I ordered. And I absolutely had to try the peach/ mango cobbler.
Let me just say that everyone at the restaurant was so nice. I did not wait too long for my order. When I got home and took my food out, it smelled great!

Sweet Blessings...wow. It's all the name. The owners are terrific. The food is flipping phenomenal. I'm not sure why I haven't heard about this place sooner than this year.</review>

<Text>Great soul food kitchen w/homey vibes and delicious food! Since, everything's cooked from scratch I advise you order ahead of time, unless you don't mind waiting and socializing a bit. The owners are very friendly and polite. It's also a great place to check out local artists' work and display your own as well. If you're an artist and wish to display/sell your own, they encourage you to do so without charging a single cent. Sweet people and kitchen for sure👍<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1578861199068, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review and support!!!!!!!!'}< /Response>< GmapID>

When my birthday rolled around, I decided that I would treat myself to takeout from here. They usually post the menu on the Sunday starting the week and can sellout fast, so watch their insta and the tock website. My birthday was the day after Mother's Day, so they sold out within the day I believe. I ordered for the same day as Mother's Day since they don't do Mondays. The minimum order was for two people so I figured I would have leftovers.</text>

So Bestia is located in what looks to be an old WAREHOUSE near Downtown LA, this happening place was LOUD, was DANCE CLUB - like in tunes, was PACKED with BEAUTIFUL people (except me) enjoying good, UNIQUE dishes, and imbibing on WELL-constructed cocktails.</review>

LLLOOOOVVVEEE this place. Food is always great and that peach cobbler omg gotta have it. The fried chicken is always juicy and that crack pepper jelly (not really crack but is addicting lol) pairs so well with the chicken. OMG and the Mac and cheese DROOLLIING. If you’re in The Valley you have to try this place if you want a home cooked meal. The menu changes daily which is great because it’s just like home you don’t always have the same thing but there are a few regulars.< /Text>

<Text>Sweet blessings is truly a blessing. I've been going to sweet blessings since there first location in van nuys; and when it was there it was difficult to find but we'll worth the detective work. On Fridays it's seafood oriented; and the shrimp n grits and the gumbo Mac are amazing, I now reside in the IE; and I made the trek. Hands down the best soul food on the west coast. Momma, the rons, and smiley (I know I missed some people, I apologise) make everything delicious. Don't believe me, prove me wrong, you will get the itus and keep going back< /Text>< user_name>

<time>1572629584295< /time><rate>5< /rate><Review>I ordered the 3 piece dark meat fried chicken combo to go with mac & cheese and fried brussels sprouts. (total $14.51) WOW!

Absolutely everything was spot on. Mac & Cheese was perfectly cheesy, and not overly drenched in sauce. You can see and taste the fried chicken had plenty of seasoning in every bite. The brussels surprised me with how subtle and sweet they can be from the south. Portions were perfectly filling and you can tell everything was made with special care.

Will be returning for more daily specials.< /Review>< pictures>

I was very pleased with my meal. I ordered the red snapper with mac n cheese and mixed veggies. All of it was delicious! There aren't too many GOOD soul food spots in LA, especially in NoHo. So I am happy I stumbled upon this one. Heads up: this spot is inside the swap meet. Head straight to the food court. I will visit again :)< /review>

< review>
We'd probably dine here more frequently if not for the distance from the South Bay.  The restaurant is in a sketchy part of town and we valet parked both times.  Valet parking is $9.</review>

YOU MUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO. There is no sweeter business to support. They are like 3 months at this location and Kat and Ron are THE nicest.  OK now down to the food. The menu changes daily with the exception of I believe the chkn, fish and mac n cha. But whatever is on the menu will be delicious. The food is cooked to order so dont come up into Sweet Blessings and start rushing and being impatient with no one. Sit and have some kool-aid and read a dam book. Let's help them become a Los Angeles hot spot. Xoxoxoxoxo</text>

<review>Sonny, my 2 year old 21 lb. mutt rescue took 3 swimming lessons. I wanted to make sure he wouldn't be anxious if he was ever in a pool or at the beach. While he isn't a typical water dog, after the first couple of laps, the vest came off & while he tried to go back up the ramp - it was to get to his momma, not because he was anxious or scared. Each lesson, he did multiple laps around and across the pool. The trainers truly have patience and were so good to my boy. Thank you Doggie Central for a wonderful experience!</review>< user_name>

My dog Brody has been swimming before, but was always afraid of the water. He had his first swim lesson here at Doggie Central today. The instructor was so patient and friendly! By the end he was jumping into the pool himself. They had plenty of toys to grab his attention, and they provide towels to dry your dog after the lesson. She even cleaned his ears for me. Swimming lessons are only offered on weekends and the spots fill up quickly so call ahead to book early. I've also walked in for a bath before and they were able to take him right away. Highly recommend this place for your pet!</Review>

Bowie loves coming here. He’s been a regular for almost 3 years and he’s still excited every morning at drop off. And they’ve been great for me also, with my erratic work hours they’re always there for me. I take comfort knowing my precious doggie is being well cared for. Thank you. 😍</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Great place to take care of your dog when the unexpected comes up. Once you clear the interview process there’s no reservations or scheduling ahead of time. So if something comes up you can simply drop your pup off to have some fun while you take care of errands or whatever. And with the livestream you can always check in on your doggo to make sure he/she’s having fun!<//Review><Time>1618713289791< /Time>< Pictures>

Upon arrival then i was informed its just an anti flea soap not what i was describing and they dont cut hair but they would make an exception.... When i picked him up he still had pollen on his face from earlier that day he still had a dog smell  and his hair was not trimmed at all! He was just well Shiny.  I think they should be clear with the customer to make sure their pups get the total experience of whats expected.< /text>< Name>

When boarding, a human stays with the dogs at all hours. They are never left alone, always surrounded by doggie and human friends. A doggie cam in each room lets you check in on your pet from wherever you are. Highly recommended. We’ve used several boarding facilities before finding Doggie Central and this is by far the best.<//review>< user_name>

I loved my experience at Doggie Central for their swim program. I have not used any of the other services. . Jonathan was amazing with my dog. My dog enjoyed his time and was able to get laps him. My dog is recovering from a meniscus tear that occurred 5 weeks ago so this was exactly what the doctor recommended as part of his rehabilitation. Thank you for a great time and I will definitely be coming back.<//text>

I like this daycare overall and we be been a fellow customers there for a while. There are a lot of playful friends there for my dog. Only slight minus my dog always gets this "daycare smell" even after staying there only for a day. Nothing too bad and smell goes away usually in a day or two. And if we leave my doggo for a few days I ask them to give him a bath on the last day.
Huge plus - they do influenza vaccine in the facility for a reasonable price.<//Review>

I have been taking my puppy Gilroy,  now dog to Doggie Central for just under 3 years.  I have boarded him there, used the daycare frequently, and had him bathed in between haircuts.  I found my dog trainer there, Denise (Pet Prana) and she also has classes.  The Doggie Cam is fun as well jot see how he is doing.  Doggie Central has everything and is reasonably priced.</review>

Doggie Central truly is the best. I’ve taken my dogs (current and former) there for 15 years and I’m able to leave them there with complete peace of mind. The staff knows my dog and treats him like family. I love the ability to check in on him during the day with the doggie cam! I highly recommend buying a day care package to save a little money.<//Text>

They put him in a life vest and after Toby showed he had the right motions they tried him without the vest and he could swim on his own. Mind blowing how this can all happen in 30 mins with the right people and encouragement. We have the videos to prove it. We will definitely bring him back. It’s a wonderful experience for all of you.

Our big Rottweiler puppy Liam has been there since he was 4 months. Doggie Central basically raised him. The staff is so friendly and Liam gets so excited to see them every time we drop him off and belief me he is dragging coming out of there because he played so much. I have a hard time putting his leash on when we are getting out the car because he jumps down and runs to the door to go play with his friends! Highly recommend them. I know Liam is safe and with people who love him and know his moods sometimes better than me.</Text>

<review>Doggie central is my pup’s favorite doggie day care. They are extremely attentive with my dog, Diego, and I have boarded him a few times as well. They really get to know each dog and their unique personality. I am very trusting that my pup will be in good hands when he is there. A big thanks to the whole staff there!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Love love how well cared for Jay Jay is with the kind and loving staff.
The only thing mama needs that would help is knowing if the pup has poo pooed after a dinner feeding.
I know- gross but good to know information!! So I don’t have to “unnecessarily” walk after a tiring day for mama and pooch!!<//review>

Great customer service. Good facilities (even if a bit older and well used) and even brought out a little swimming pool for the dogs to splash around in on a hot day which was a nice touch. I would definitely utilize their services in future for my dog.<//review>

Our dog Louie loves Doggie Central! He attends 2-3 times a week. He jumps out of the car and runs to the front door right when we pull up! We are so happy to have found this place so close to our home.<//Text>

<Text>This place is no frills, but I’m totally fine with that as long as they keep taking care of my babies. They have a separate area for the small ones, and they even allow my two pups to sleep together in a separate area when I’m away so that my smallest (she’s 4 lbs) stays safe. She also likes to be held, and I often times see the staff on camera holding her throughout the day, which makes my heart so happy. My husband and I are not from here, so it’s nice to have help we can trust when we need it.< /Text>< name>

<Name>Christopher Schielzo<//Name><Review>Doggie Central is very convenient for me. It's super close to work and I love the fact that they do not require appointments for daycare so it's great for last minute decisions.

The only complaints I have is that the pricing is a pretty high. Especially the $5 fee to administer their own food. I typically bring my own, but sometimes forget it. I've been to other doggie daycare spots where the food is complimentary. I'm already spending $45 to have him sit in a room with 30 other dogs, so I think tossing in a half a cup of food isn't too much to ask.

The other complaint is that they require a deposit when scheduling boarding over the holiday and the deposit DOES NOT go toward the cost of the stay which I think is ridiculous. I completely understand why there's a deposit required but it should at least go toward the cost of the stay.

Still give the place 4 stars tho. Mostly for the convenience.< /Review>< response>

One other place offers it as well but not as great of a set up as doggie central. I found this place because it was closest to me and I’m so grateful I did.

We love Doggie Central! We've been bringing our doggie to visit for about 8 years. She gets excited when we pull up and the tail wags as soon as she walks in. We're always greeted with a smile and they treat her like a member of the family.  We wouldn't take our furry baby anywhere else. Doggie Central is her home away from home.<//Review>

I have been taking Joe to Doggie Central for over 2 years. I totally trust them with the care of him. They interview all dogs before they allow them to come which I think is a good practice. Joe has had day care visits and overnights. He enjoys his friends
and I appreciate the care the staff gives him and myself. The pricing is very fair and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a safe and clean environment for their dog to play or stay.</Review>

I think our pup had a good time after her first visit?! She's been "out cold" sleeping since she got home after 2 nights with you!!! That's a good thing because she is a 7 month old wild girl!  Thank you Doggie Central.< /review>

We have recently returned with our 2 dog for daycare & grooming services  under the new management. Since we’ve return we notice the play pens smell cleaner and the service provided by the groomer is very good, my dogs are not hesitant to go in with the groomer. Staff is professional & courteous. We will continue to use their services in the future and the cameras in all play pens is a plus. Thank you Doggie Central & staff.</review>

<review>Doggie Central, for years has treated my dog, Max like family. They offer such services as walks, treats, and baths in a cage free environment,  that ensures  that our fur baby’s routine isn’t disturbed while we are away. I have enjoyed being able to watch Max on the doggie cam and calling the staff to inquire how is doing. I highly recommend Doggie Central as a boarding facility if your ever in need of place to take care of your dog when you can’t.<//review>< rate>

We used to go every Friday for Swim, however, the price per class increased by 60%. So, it used to be $25, now it’s $40 for a 30 minute class. Not worth the cost.</review>

This place is super professional yet friendly and warm. Our dog didn't want to be boarded but they were able to make him comfortable and keep him happy. We would use them again, in a flash. Their prices are reasonable and they have specials for doggie daycare on Saturdays and Mondays. We were happy to have them recommended to us.< /review>

If you are about to have your dog embark on an extended stay, you can ask the management and they'll offer a 10-15% discount.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2b0a9a9a1334b:0xa4311261311f2dd1<//gmapID>< Date>

<rating>5< /rating><text>i have been going here on and off for 2+ years. i really like the new owner. he is very gentle, remembers every dogs name after one meeting and seems to really love his work. sometimes when i pick up my dog, i can hear the staff talking to my dog through the door. they really seem affectionate - they  have sweet nicknames for him, etc. (and he is a VERY large, not sweet dog).  i have been to about a dozen daycares in CA and more should be like this one.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>We use a different place for our normal daycare, but Doggie Central is a bit closer and a little cheaper for the 6 hour half day rate. I dont love that its indoors though. My dog is a bit bigger than medium and she goes to the large dog rooms but those are just smaller cement rooms. She always comes home smelling like pee. I do wish they had a bigger outdoor area and could give the big dogs some outdoor time too. But they're always friendly. I watch the doggie cam and see my babies getting lots of love and attention and playtime. Great staff.have used them for boarding and daycare. And will again.</review>< pics>

I just moved to Playa Vista and needed a daycare and boarding facility while I'm at work and when I travel. These guys are in Plays Vista so it makes it extremely convenient.

I have a 2 year old golden retriever that just loves going there. As soon as we turn the corner he gets really excited. He always comes home nice and tired which is great because I work long hours.

I love that I can watch him while I'm at work or away for the weekend, the webcams are awesome. I also love their long hours, I work in the entertainment industry so the hours can be brutal.

They also have a dog pool and I like to have him swim while he is there. He loves swimming so this place is perfect for him. Not many places have a huge pool like they do.

I would definitely recommended, nice staff and clean facility.<//Review>

My 10 year old Golden Retriever mix began experiencing osteoarthritis in one of his shoulders this past June. Developed a limp when he transitioned from lying down to standing.  I found Doggie Central on the internet and thought I would give them a try with aquatic therapy.  Within 2 weeks of working with Tony, the canine aquatic trainer, Brownie (my Golden Retriever mix) had no more limp and was able to get up without any difficulty.  Brownie has now been training with Tony for almost 4 months, and he is in amazing shape, stronger, with more endurance.  I wish that I had started Brownie years ago with aquatic training because I've seen the physical benefit of it. We commute from Simi Valley to train with Tony.  I would totally recommend aquatic training at DC with Tony for anyone who wants to increase his/her dog's quality of health.< /Text>

I have been bringing my pups here for about 6 years. Mochi and Azuki love this place - climbing all over me trying to get out of the car. Rigo was one of the first people I met when I first started bringing my dogs - I am so happy he has returned. I won't take them anyplace else.< /review>

Very large property therefore this property provides more storage space size options than most locations in the area.

I was escorted by "Jason" to available storage spaces so I could select the best size for my needs. Didn't have to "request" eligible discounts from Agent as it was all factored in based upon my chosen size space. All details of the property were disclosed and all documents were openly shared and provided to me. All my questions and concerns were answered.

I felt like I was treated like a true customer, that nothing was hidden from me, that all information was provided respectfully and honestly.

Take note:

that next door to this storage property is a hotel chain property and a U-Haul location is also in the vicinity. Very convenient all the way around if you're moving into the area or departing it. A Costco with a Gas Station is also just a few blocks away.

The more options, the better opportunity to customize your move which makes your monumental task less stressful and easier on you!< /text>

MICE INFESTATION!!!!!!!!!!!
I just saw a mouse coming off a person's unit and a lady moving from another unit to a bigger unit shows me all her items were cover on nice dropping.
THIS IS HORRIBLE!

This storage location has been going from bad to worse. I let the staff know more than 3 times that the light outside my unit doesn't work and they haven't done anything for 3 months. One of the employees told me that I should buy my own light.  Isn't that a great custom service??<//text>

Today we were helped by Stephen at the Sunnyvale PSA LOCATION
We were very impressed and pleased with the service provided by him. We had a previous bad experience with other locations but his customer service & amazing, welcoming attitude changed our experience with this company!
Thank you again.<//text>

<review>These people who work here are trained to help their customers who are moving and might be more stressed out than when in other life situations. I am so happy with this non judgement place as I was going through "it". I use this place to store all my business related items to keep my personal life separate from my business life. I always feel safe when on site and I like the professional environment they provide too. I recently had a interaction with Toteana, Nikki & Serena that was very helpful for me. All three were there to assist me with everything I needed. I really appreciate the staff here and their safe coronavirus standards are all up to date too.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Tammy was amazing.  She walked me through everything, was very attentive of all the covid-19 protocols, and (with great patience) repeated any information that didn’t sink into my thick skull.  Definitely a much better place than any other storage facility I’ve been too.< /Review>

Z was very friendly, helpful and straight-forward.  I initially rented a smaller space but decided to get a bigger storage, and Z made the transfer quick and painless.  If you need storage, go to this location, Public Storage Property # 08014 and look for Z.  Awesome job, Z!</Text>

<Review>Too expensive for the space given. Beware 5x5 is actually smaller. Beware they close 1hr earlier on weekends just to have a reason to give you a warning. You cannot be inside not one minute after closing time, or you get a warning.< /Review>< pictures>

This review has been long in the coming. We needed a storage facility in a hurry last year due to unforeseen circumstances. We selected this Public Storage location due to its close proximity and its reviews and we were NOT disappointed. Morgan, the Property Manager, made us feel at ease right away. She was and is professional and friendly and takes the time to help you out. The whole staff is friendly, professional and helpful. This location earns its great reviews as far as I am concerned. Think of them when you need a great storage facility. And thank you again to the whole staff, especially Morgan.<//Review>

They raised the monthly rent on my unit 28% after six months due to "market conditions". While I understand the need to increase prices over time, six months? And 28%? I don't know about you, but I haven't received a 28% raise this year, and I doubt the employees of Public Storage have either.< /Text>

If I could give it zero stars I would. And here is why.

3 weeks after renting my unit, I received a courtesy call from the center letting me know that I had until the 1st of the month to pay rental fee. However, upon logging in to make my first payment before the deadline, I found that my balance was about 3 times what I was expecting to pay. I still made my expected payment and called the next day during business hours to ask about what I thought was an error— the remaining balance. They informed me that my payment was actually due the 27th thus I have to pay the extreme late fees or my stuff would have to be sold. I let them know that their agent called me a week earlier and said otherwise so I shouldn’t be punished for an error on the part of their own employee. They basically told me that I shouldn’t have listened to him and instead read my contract closely.

So yeah, it seems to me like they misinform clients in order to trap them into paying more than their original discounted rate. Beware. Please pay more to store somewhere else if you can. This company will go out of its way, even calling you to trick you on the payment date in order to charge excessive late fees. Please beware.<//text>

I had a wonderful experience at this location when I opened a new storage this July 2019. All the staff there were very helpful, nice, and courteous. Special thanks to Morgan the manager who was very knowledgeable, quick, and had great customer service. Beonka one of the associates there helped me open my account and get a storage space. She was quick, kind, and very helpful. I would definitely recommend this location to all my friends.<//text>

I went in on Saturday based off of the units displayed as open on their website. I arrived at 1:55pm and the rep was helping an older gentleman. She kept looking at me as I walked up but said nothing. So I said hi first and asked to speak about renting a unit. She said, “it will be one minute while I finish with him “. At 2:14pm I went in and asked her how much longer since she told me it would be 1 minute and I’d been waiting patiently for 20 mins!!!! They said they’re finishing up. When they were done I showed her the print out of what’s online and asked where her 5x5 is located. She then said well that would depend. I asked depend on what? She said well I don’t know which one you would reserve. I said I’m telling you clear as day right now, a 5x5, but only if it is close to an entrance. She continued to be very difficult and had an incredibly lazy demeanor about her. I then said, ok what about another size, which one is by an entrance? All she said was it would all depend. I asked her how do you rent a unit to someone when you can not answer even 1 of their questions?! She did not bother to help me at all. Her name badge was sloppily displayed so I could only read the last few letters ‘dra’.  I had just wasted 25 valuable minutes of my life! I work in healthcare trying to keep people like this safe, and I get treated with this level of disrespect! So I left and rented at Extra Space Storage instead!! Beautiful facility and very helpful employees!!!<//Text>

Remember if your move out day is the first day of the month, they will charge you for the whole following month, no matter how long before you have notified them of your move out date. The rent is not prorated. Nothing is mentioned on their website about this. Even their move out blog post hasn’t mentioned this. Total trap to charge you extra.<//Text>

Public Storage is a great business to store your stuff when you are moving or just need somewhere with extra space! In the office I had the pleasure of being served by Emma who showed me the unit and answered all the questions I had. In particular I am grateful that Emma was able to provide me with top level service and knowledge to help me get the unit I needed.< /review>

Wonderful experience and fabulous storage property!! Moving to my new home has been a challenging experience, and I’ve been looking for a safe place to store additional items.  Morgan (the PS property manager) and her team were amazing in making me feel comfortable, and making this part of my move so easy!  She and her colleague walked me through my items to store, helped me find the right sized unit — and even helped me pick a unit that was (luckily) near the elevators!   We went through all the appropriate options.

The Sunnyvale property is large, clean, with multiple security features, and most storage lockers are temperature controlled (some are drive up — open to the parking area).  The facility is in a safe location (especially important).  Morgan was professional, kind, and helped me de-stress.

Special thanks for your kindness.<//Text>

This place is awesome! The units are climate controlled! I can't believe how clean this property is compared to others.  Best of all is the service...Hasan took our reservation, explained all of our options, and walked us through the facility.   In the end we decided to go with a 5x10 and bought the insurance.  We are so happy with our experience that we recommend this property to our friends and family.  Shout out to Hash Browns and Morgan!

<text>I'd like to thank Stephen, Mikey, and Morgan for doing an excellent job with assisting me with my new storage space. Everything went smooth from the beginning to the end. They showed me the storage space in person, showed me how to unlock the gates and use pad-locks, etc. They made sure I knew what I was doing before I start to do things alone. They were thorough with their information and instructions. Stephen made it clear about payments & dates. I feel so comfortable with this whole transaction. I cannot wait to move in!

Great place. Staff is friendly and the facility is always clean. My only complaint is that their hours is a bit ridiculous. The facility closes too early during the weekday and weekend! It was only last year or so when they stayed open until at least 8pm.< /review>

<review>Rented a Storage Unit at this location and was helped by associate "Z" (for Zenon) who was very knowledgeable and courteous...Z made sure to explain everything about the contract, payment schedule detials and the operation of accessing the gate and storage building, and he was patient and thorough in answering all the nitty-gritty details of my questions...I felt I was in good hands and was all set up for the unit rental with no glitches or problems. This is a clean and well-run facility and I recommend it to others.</review>< pics>

<Review>Emma was very helpful when we were still undecided at the last minute as to which size unit to take. She took time to show us both 10x10 and 10x15. Thanks Emma.

The property is nice and clean. Elevators are a little slow. Just make sure to know the timings as it is not a 24x7 property.

Overall, I like the place and the folks are helpful.< /Review><user_name>Raghu Babburi</user_name><user_id>112946051973462048950< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

My experience at Public Store was a great experience. The office was full of great character. All the workers gave us great suggestions on how to pack up our stuff for our move. Alyssa, Erica and the boss Lou were outstanding at helping us with the rental process and explained the month to month lease. The place looks great. My unit is more than I expected and I left the office in a great mood which is a plus. Thank you guys.< /review>

<review>Gage M. was working so fast, excellent customer service, polite, respectful and is a very fast learner. Really excellent experience. His manager Rochelle was extremely helpful as well when we had more questions. 5-star storage experience.  Fast forward many months later, Z, Christina were working today, the day I moved out.  I cannot say enough about the customer service throughout our entire stay with Public Storage.  I wish we could have the same one down in SoCal where we needed one.  But we found another one just as awesome.  Everything was always professional, friendly and the staff are all very knowledgeable.  Thank you for making our storage experience 5-star from beginning to end!!!</review>< pictures>

<review>Being in the military I required an extensive amount of flexibility, prior to moving in, during, and upon concluding my stay.  Morgan’s professionalism and ability to accommodate all my needs, put this particular “Public Storage” at the very top of my storage lists. If ever in the area again this would be my first choice.</review>< pics>

<Review>I’ve just moved to my third storage unit at this facility. I’ve always considered it the best Public Storage facility and I have rented from them at locations nearby. The staff are very nice and helpful, the site is very secure and I find the rental fees offer the best value in the area. It’s also very easy to get into and out of this location because the street isn’t as busy.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Public Storage is better than most. I was looking for storage and visited the PS facility. Yuri showed me around the grounds and the unit I was interested in. The facilities were clean and the unit was exactly what I needed. The process for the agreement to rent the unit was straightforward. It was a lot of paperwork but I expected it so no surprise. Yuri, Alisa and Brian (the dream team) were all helpful and efficient. I’ve moved a lot of stuff into the unit already and am pleased with PS. The only downside is it’s a busy facility but understandable because it’s a good, well maintained and managed business. Two thumbs up for PS!< /review>

Karla was very helpful and patient while we shared our requirements with her. We thought we knew what size we needed but after discussing our needs we realized we needed a smaller space. She also showed us multiple units when we got picky and helped us decide on one we were satisfied with. Karla also shared tips on utilizing the space efficiently and moving out.
Keep in mind that the lock is yours to keep and insurance is required.< /review>

Really closer to 2.5. The space was fine,  though it had more evidence of bugs than I would have liked. Access was good at first, but not great. Then they changed the hours such that I either had to wake up at the crack of dawn or leave work early. Then they sent an email with a 25% rate increase. This was the last straw for me - 10x10 for over $200/mo when I got a 10x20 just down the street for $5 more with better access hours. Shop around, there's a plethora of options for self storage in Sunnyvale.< /review>

We've been at this location for years but recently decided we needed a larger unit.  Kelly was very helpful and nice and got everything done in a flash.  The property is also very clean and well lighted and the location times are really convenient.  No complaints!

We moved out of our unit March of 2017 and Rachelle and Stephen were great.  They were helpful and friendly and made our move out a breeze.  If we ever need storage again we'll definitely use Public Storage.< /Review>

Great bang for your buck, as far as storage options go near the Bay Area. The buildings were always clean inside and out every time I went there. They offer free dollies to use, but most of the time I've been there they were all in use - be prepared to bring your own dollies if you are moving a lot here.

I had my items stored here for over a year - no problems at all. If you live in SF and need long-term storage, but don't want to spend over $150/month on a 10x15 space, head here for a deal.</text>

I use this storage because it’s close to my work. Stopped in real quick after my shift to grab a space heater from my unit. Upon leaving there was a very rude woman waiting at the gate for me. She begun to yell at me very rudely to the point where I just blocked out what she was saying as that is not how I deserve to be treated. They need to work on communication and customer service skills here as they defenitely should not be yelling at a customer. I have never had problems before hear and the other staff have been respectful as I have been respectful to them. Avoid this place .</review>

I rented a unit here from 2016-2017 and it was generally awesome. The unit was in the climate controlled building with concrete floors and I had access to it until 9pm. Fast forward to 2018 and I needed a unit again- They have changed their hours so that it's basically impossible to access if you work full time during the day and will only have weekend access.
The unit we have now is not in the climate controlled building but they didn't emphasize that up front before we signed so make sure you ask. Floors in the back building are plywood and they put pesticide packets everywhere so it has a weird smell (just FYI if you're sensitive to that). They increase prices often and for the back building units, it's overpriced. I would give this place more stars if their hours were better and if they were more upfront about the units.< /Text>

<review>The storage unit was really good. It is easy to get in and out of and rarely were there very many people at the location. Also, they make available carts to assist with loading and unloading. We got a good deal with our storage unit here and would recommend this location to any one in Sunnyvale.</review><name>Steve Krause<//name>< time>

<Text>Their automatic system is horrible and staff isn’t friendly or helpful. Drove out of my way to get here before they closed, was in the elevator 2minutes before they closed but the system wouldn’t take my code. Staff refused to help and said they couldn’t do anything. Going to say Angela by name is particularly unhelpful. Wasted an hour of my day. I’m going to look for other storage units that are more accommodating and actually care.<//Text>< Pics>

At first I wasn't too sure about this location, due to the fact that it's a bit far from my house. I went In to check it and miss beonkaa( not sure if spelled correctly) gave me run down of how  this location functions. She showed the spaces and how much it would cost and asked if I would like their insurance. I was going to say no but she talked me into getting it. Which was honestly the best thing I did. I love this location and if it wasn't for beonkaa's excellent customer service I would have definitely go to another one.</review>

Would recommend this storage to others, and have now had rentals at this location twice. Property is clean and feels secure. Visiting on a Saturday morning can be a little busy, but staff are helpful and make effort to help. My unit, the elevators and hallways were all clean and tidy, and I didn't have any issues or damage to my property either time I had storage here.<//review>

Quick and painless process of moving in. The property manager, Richard, was friendly and helpful, and explained everything in detail. Great value for the storage unit. Only downside is storage access is not 24/7 (closes at 9pm).<//Text>

Moving is not easy, but helpful people along the way can make things slightly easier. Yuri at Public Storage, 1060 Stewart Drive in Sunnyvale was very helpful in making us get the possession of a storage space that suited our needs.  This Public Storage location along with a smiling Yuri is highly recommended!< /review>

<Text>Customer service staff in office are unprofessional and like to gossip about customers and other coworkers. They are very happy to explain in great detail why they can not do certain basic things for you. They provide few solutions and seem bothered to provide any customer service or decent communication.  A favorite phrase, "I can't make those promises." They don't provide clear explanation of policies when you first sign up (at least the manager we spoke with gave us misinformation) and wouldn't honor what we were previously told upon vacating our unit. Wouldn't recommend this location.< /Text><Name>Rachel Araiza</Name>< time>

Prescilla is new but very friendly and helpful.  I don't like that the hours have been shortened.  They should pay the employees better and allow them to come in earlier and leave later or have someone on site.  The new hours are very inconvenient.</Review>

<review>This is the best self-storage facility that I've ever dealt with. The staff (especially Richard) is helpful & actually makes an effort to keep it in good shape. A CLEAN bathroom available at all times (not only when the front desk is open) is a big plus.

Is pretty dark at night there, but I've never seen funky business going on there. And they aren't cheap, that's for sure. But hey, is Sunnyvale.</review><Resp>None</Resp><username>Ms Kiu< /username><GmapID>0x808fb6221b798579:0xfe96d77baf83bafd</GmapID><Rating>5</Rating>< Pics>

Don't ever come here period. Can't express my frustration. I got the first month for $1 but I think I would pay 200 rather than come to this place.</Text>

Tuesday (7/7) i arrived late in the afternoon, four cars/trucks in the parking lot, zero carts available.  Went looking for a cart in a couple of adjacent buildings - no carts. One customer exits building with no cart, and one drags a cart from another building.  Where did all the carts go?  I think Brian or someone else was paying attention to customer's complaints

Wednesday (7/8) - Sunday (7/12) - Each day, at least one or two carts in main building lobby even with multiple cars parked outside

Monday (7/13) afternoon - One big truck, two trailers, and 7 cars in the lot.  I was expecting a long wait, but was pleasantly surprised to get a cart within 2 minutes.  Rough guess, maybe 9-10 carts in use.  PS#08014, Y'all redeemed yourselves - - You get a 5-Star based on today, in particular.  And yesterday.

Keep it up!<//review>

By mistake, I left a very precious item in the hallway in front of my unit and only became aware of it missing until well past the 30 day holding period. Despite the lapse in the holding period, Morgan and Beonkaa, appreciating the item's value, kept it safe and sound. When I went to the office to inform them of my lost item, they did not let me know they had the item until they confirmed I was the rightful owner (they reviewed the security camera footage for confirmation). Not only did I appreciate them keeping my item safe, they did an excellent job in ensuring it was returned to its rightful owner. They went above and beyond their call of duty! I highly recommend this storage unit - Morgan and Beonkaa are awesome!< /Review>

Big thanks to Lou, Alyssa and Erica for great service today in the office. Erica took us out to view our unit, she explained the $1 for the first month and we decided to store since we were saving so much. Everyone in the office was very informative and knowledgeable. I will be sure to let anyone I know that is moving to store here.<//Text>

Have been renting storage units at this location for a few years. Gave them a 5-star review in early 2015. Unfortunately, with the expansion of the location, service deteriorated at least in my experience. I moved to a smaller unit in early April but still am waiting for a promised refund two months later. Contacted to office 3 times by phone and in person and was promised a call but so far that has not happened. Great experience 2 years ago but lousy customer service now.</review>

Its just a boring storage place. It has doors, an office, and gates. Its very secure, so secure the elevator has a password, that you have to use for every floor. Staff is a little unhelpful but im sure they deal with a lot.< /Text>

I'm a military spouse and it is very hard to coordinate moving across states. We had a mix-up with cancelling reservations and trying to get back our reservation, and calling family members to help get a storage unit since we have already booked a U-Haul. Very time-sensitive, Russell helped us out a lot. Helped us out with our reservation from a very stressful situation. I'm glad everything worked out because he really did help us out. Especially when you have to drive a 20ft U-Haul truck 16+ hours on the road... Military life is hard and I'm glad it worked out in the end. Thanks Public Storage! Oh, and also, their facilities are very clean, gated, with cameras around so your valuables are safe! Highly recommend!</text>

<Review>Kudos to Karla and her team at Public Storage.They were helpful and professional and had a great unit price. I got a unit that was accessible by a 53ft truck and even help from the staff when the truck showed up without warning.

Two things that I would like to be different. Number one, you need to buy a cylinder-lock for your unit which is an addition one time fee of $19. However they will install it for you and help  you get it to work when i'ts too stiff to turn due to newness.  The second thing is out of their control. They only offer a $5000 maximum insurance policy.< /Review><GmapID>0x808fb6221b798579:0xfe96d77baf83bafd<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
An absolute predatory business. My stuff was moved involuntarily several years ago into this storage unit. Stuff was stolen with lock lying on the road in front of unit. They don't own up to it. Price gouging happens the longer you stay, more than doubled in my case to $400 for 8'x8'. Final piece, no pro-rated refund even if was a day into the month. I was over by a week.</review>

The facility is very clean. When walking into the office was greeted with smiles. Watching Rochelle multitask helping others and being able to show me a unit was great. Erica, alyssa and rochelle worked as a team and i highly recommend to store at this facility.  Keep up the good work ladies!!!!!</review>

Russell (Customer Svc Representative) at the 1060 Stewart Dr. Sunnyvale location was very helpful and direct in conducting business. He was very professional and explained the company policy and affiliated contract very well.

Thank you,
Russell and Public Storage<//Review>

The entire team of this facility are awesome... It was really sad for me to leave... Every time I walked to their office they not only were friendly and helped me with what I needed but also lifted my spirit... Next time I need to store something I will come back despite how far is from my location...<//review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Worst experience I've ever had at a storage. I was told the facility sprayed for bugs. When I went to empty my storage this past week it was infested with roaches. I had to throw away my bed and few boxes of items. I spoke with a manager on site who seemed to careless which makes it even worse. Luckily i took photos of everything. I've been trying to get ahold of someone from the cooperate office and still have yet to get a call back. I recommend you try another storage site.<//text>< UserId.>

Service is terrible. Employees mistreat their tenants. I was treated unfairly. I got kicked out because I would stay on my cell phone on property. Their restroom is always filthy and broken down. Entire facility was always dirty. Do not recommend this facility to anyone.< /review>

<UserId.>102488435967437712244<//UserId.><text>Staff is very friendly and definitely try to please you.

BUT, why do they rent a unit that does not have a working light?  And why do they say there is a short somewhere in the wiring and they can't fix it until the 4 units are all vacant, which of course will never happen?  I sure hope everyone's insurance covers fire damage.  (Oh yes, and the gentleman did admit that they would only rent it to someone else even though it is defective).

To be fair, they did offer me another unit at the same price, but of course I had already moved my stuff into the first unit.  So, I then moved my stuff a 2nd time into the other unit which did have a functioning light.  And, after surrendering my license, they let me use one of their carts to transport my boxes.  When I returned to the office, they failed to give me my license back.  Then I left and did not realize they had not given it back until later that day.  Not even so much as a courtesy call to say they forgot to give me my license back.  When I returned, the gentleman held out my license for me saying "Did you forget something?"

One more thing.  Their employee tried changing the bulb without wearing glasses or gloves.  The bulb busted right above him, he was fortunate not getting any broken glass into his eyes.

I would think that after all of this they would have offered me a $1.00 move in special, but not a word.<//text>< name>

<text>The service representatives are friendly.

When I reserved a unit with public storage in Sunnyvale, i was renting another public storage unit in another city. Over the phone i was told that the signup bonus was valid, because by the time I would get to Sunnyvale, my old unit and account would be closed.
After driving for 500 miles, and showing at the storage facility with my truck and all the movers, it turned out that I was not eligible for the discount.
Then it turned out that the light in my unit did not work. Of course since I have already measured the unit size and bought shelves, it was too late to change to a different size unit. I was told that they cannot repair the light because it was too high and they don't have a ladder.
Finally, I am currently standing at my facility in Sunnyvale, trying to get an essential item. The elevator is broken. Considering that I am only at the facility once a month, no doubt this was broken for some time.
I am looking at my documentation, and of course I was not provided the short access code to the stairwells only to the gate.
Its 7am, and the customer service will be here at 9:30am. Wasted trip.
I had to call late in the evening to get confirmation about which doors were open and how to get in via backdoors (far from obvious, no access to second level from first floor). Overall i had to spend nearly 2.5 hours of my time driving back and forth to get access to my unit.
Very disappointing.< /text></record></dataset><record>

非常棒的地方，价格合理服务专业！最好直接在网站上预约。This place is run by some serious professionals! Their office is most tidy-n-clean I've ever seen in similar facilities. The staff there are totally helpful and have a great sense of humor:) I only arrived in the US for the first month and needed a place to put my stuff before I'm able to move in to my apartment which is available early next month. I searched on Google map and this location is just next to my hotel. I rent a small storage of 4' x 7' and the price is ok. Extras you may need to pay are the processing fee($20+), insurrance($9+/m), and the lock if you need it.<//Text>

<Text>Karla and Bob were both very helpful and efficient in processing my rental application.  I actually reserved this unit from the Public Storage location on Arques.  Shanice and Arvin at the Arques location were both equally helpful as well in recommending the best unit to address my budget and storage needs.< /Text>< name>

<Review>If you need to get into your storage unit after 6 pm, forget it.  I've been here for the past few years and they keep shortening access hours and increasing price.

People work here are not nice. They never give you complete information. They also charge you for not using service. They also force you take add on services like insurance and boxes, bubble wrap, locks etc etc.<//text>

They have good customer service over the phone  especially when this employees answer the phone. Letty and jose are the best people in this place they are nice and polite but the people on the from desk are rude when you go  to get something for the warehouse they give you that paperwork to sign but with a really bad attitude is felt like people bother them no customer service on the front desk .< /review>

My dispatcher sent me here 1 day before the actual appointment time and the lady in recieving told me that appointment was the next day and they are too busy and she will try to get me unloaded the same day and after waiting for an hour i got a call from her and they started unloading and let me free in no time. AWSOME Staff and FAST service.<//review>

<review>Best McLane I've been to. My appointment was at 1130 and I arrived the day before and was parked on mid-counties road so I could check-in at 1000.
Quiet street and wasn't bothered by anyone, there's a black bear not far that you can walk to our bobtail to.
The morning of my appointment, I got a knock on the truck at 0800 with someone from McClane saying they could get me in a door ASAP. Have him the bills and he told me any door from 28-32. Docked into 30 and then walked over and checked in at for 19. Waited in the truck for someone to check and cut the seal. Opened doors and backed in at 0830. Iliana's food truck stops in for drivers to get real food or snacks. I was unloaded by 1000 and able to park back on the street until I got my next load. Again, great mclane!</review>< Pics>

The Bad.. Super Screwy and tight for a McLane.
Be sure to come in off MidCounties. Otherwise you'll have to Blind Side or get turned around.

Everyone was nice and I got unloaded quickly.</Review>

<review>12/1/2018 at 5:07 PM a  McLane truck took Box Canyon Road, a shortcut from San Fernando Valley to Simi valley.
Box Canyon Road is limited to:
NO TRUCKS OVER 6,000 LB
His actions endangered other drivers as it is impossible for a truck of that size to negotiate the road without crossing the double yellow line.

Not bad to deliver to. They had me in a door in 30 minutes and unloaded an hour after that. Staff is friendly enough. Some parking on street available if you show up early or out of hours.<//Text>

For a McLane this is a 10 star place. But it is still McLane. Reasonable unload time. Staff was ok, don't wear anything but work boots or very good shoes. They are picky about sandals, slip ons, flip flops, open toed, etc. Plastered signs all over.</Text>

<Text>I actually went to their other location off of Oxford in Chula Vista. They have a Thursday special for the birria pizza for $12! However, It's definitely worth full price of $18. The birria was delicious and the portion size was perfect. The consume used for dipping was very tasty. I would definitely be back again!<//Text><gmapID>0x80d94df5f5728bd3:0xc35931d30f313263</gmapID><Date>1621610179919< /Date>< username>

<name>Anthony Sledge</name><time>1621101668498< /time><Rating>1</Rating><review>Tacos were decent, but not worth your money when your business is not appreciated. The cashier has terrible customer service and I would not recommend this place to anyone. The first time I came to Birria Kings, I was with my family and we spent about $100 dollars at this place because we were super excited to try their food as well as support a small local restaurant. We was help by the same young lady both times at the register and both times were terrible. I believe in second chances, but never a third. Also, I hate to make this about color, but I witnessed her treat the next two customers like real customers and they didn’t look like me, sad. Word of advice, treat the people that decides to spend their hard earned money at your establishment like you appreciate them, no matter how they look. They may just come back with more people. Please understand that there are always other options, I will never spend another dollar here.< /review>< Pics>

Great Birria with a fun twist. But it’s heavy, salty, greasy - in a delicious way. Don’t plan on doing anything after, except lounging on the couch or taking a nap. The Birria Pizza was great and so were the quesatacos. Ramen was ok. There are better Ramen noodles out there and they were overcooked in my portion. This dish could use some fine tuning. Also wish they had lamb Birria.< /Review>

Overall they're good. The quesataco was the highlight for sure. The tacos are little on the small side compared to other places I've tried. If possible I would give it a 3.5 rating and I'm only knocking .5 because they screwed up my order(ordered 4 tacos but I got 3) :(. Would definitely come back for the quesataco.< /review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Waited in a line for an HOUR which only had 15 people. The cashier said the line was backed up because of the birria pizza - if something is making you that backed up maybe you should take it off the menu? Food was subpar besides the ramen, which was delicious. Tacos and quesabirria were tiny, expensive, and bland. Way better birria in San Diego, will never go back.<//text>< Pics>

It's bland, tasteless and has literally no seasoning or flavor. The tortilla was super soggy, falling apart and the cheese tasted gross. the consume tasted literally like salty water. you can buy much better birria at a cheaper price somewhere else. we will NOT be coming back to this place, super disappointed< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Excellent AF! Food truck located in a little strip mall that serves birria dishes. I ordered several things. The birria itself is tender, juicy and flavorful...like the carnitas of beef. BirriaRamen was awesome! Now, it's not like authentic ramen so go to a ramen place for that but the consome, the beef and the noodle combo is delightful. The birria quesadilla lacked serious presentation. I didn't think I was going to like it. It was greasy and sort of limp but it was super good tasting despite all that. Lol. It was also gigantic! I also got the taco and quesotaco and a side of consome. Both tacos were good but I did like the queso taco slightly more. Pour that consome on top and u r golden. Didn't even use the salsa which I normally require on my Mexican food. Reasonably priced. This place is good!! Birria, yum!<//Review>

This place is busy and there's a reason for it! I tried the birria tacos, birria pizza, birria quesadilla, and birria ramen.  All were delicious! Definately lived up to the hype.</Review>

This place is a joke!
Their tacos dorados look like they bought the shells off the taco bell next door. I didn't know if I should laugh or be mad because they're more expensive than soft tacos (I wonder how those look 😒)
Flavor is whatever but can't call that birria
We got 1/8 of a lemon and a slice of radish for every 3 tacos (if you can't have them out because of covid at least give more)
Salsa is not even spicy wth!

They have the nerve to put that name 🤣🤣</text>

My first time trying Birria ramen and it sure did not disappoint it had a wonderful broth and lots of ramen noodles to soak up all that juice, love the Birria inside and it had radish, onions, cilantro, I also had the Birria pizza which is like a quesadilla but is the size of a pizza, Birria meat , and lots of cheese, the Birria tacos are deliciouso soo come and get it cuz they get busy :) staff is sweet and friendly:)<//Text>

The worst. Long wait for a disappointed recipe. The name doesn't match the quality.

I waited in line when all of a sudden a family cut in front , I told the staff they didn't do anything. Never coming back.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) 2.5 stars little to say
Does not meet your expectations
How can it be? You ask for your tortilla logically golden taco
And they give you a taco bell type taco
Corriosa omelette ..
Birramen. It is totally not what they advertise or sell
No tortillas. In to the Order
Don't expect that flavored reddish birria.
Definitive is not to return

Birria the Chinese H street. The best right now in birria

(Original)
2.5 stars poco que decir
No cumple con sus espectativas
Como puede puede ser pides taco dorado logicamente su tortilla
Y te Dan un taco tipo taco bell
Tortilla corriosa ..
Birramen. Totalmente no es lo que anuncian o venden
No tortillas. En la orden
No esperes esa birria rojisa y con sabor.
Definitivo no es para regresar

Birria el chino H street. Lo mejor en estos momentos en birria< /review>

She went over everything right when I entered the store let me know the carts were sanitized and the dressing rooms/restrooms are closed for the time being, to social distance and make sure your nose, mouth and chin stay inside your mask. Very thorough and she does her job with such kindness, great way to start out my shopping trip!! Also Thursdays are $1 tag days!!< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< pics>

<review>Digging deep usually yields a hidden treasure. One of the nicer Willy's in the IE and I live in orange county. I seen a whole lotta Willy's! And this one I'll make time for. Half the store is clothing and a huge men's section and new home goods, new as in new in the package heavily discounted.  Sheets,  pillows curtains and comforters? Yeah, home stuff.</review>< Pics>

I love shopping at my local Goodwill.  Most of my work and casual clothes were purchased there. And I've bought brand name items, Calvin Klein, Liz Claiborne, Franco Sardo and Chico's. Can't go wrong. I stopped shopping any where else when I need something for me.<//review>

This store has gone downhill in the last 6-8 months. More stuff on floor than shelves.  Very dirty, staff...well, like they could care less about anything. compare to one on foothill. Will stop going to this one. Maybe goodwill all together. I'm an avid thrift shopper, love looking around for bargains. They're r other thrift shops, check around people.<//text>

Overall good, clean store.  I find super good deals here but I take my time and only buy 1/2 off items.  Like every goodwill depends on what you're shopping for, hit or miss, but I like the clothing selection here, I always seem to find a sweet deal especially on outerwear, many selections appear new with tags. Some staff members are friendlier than others but I could care less as long as I'm getting a deal.  All I need to know is the color of the week and I'm good.</review>

A little understaffed, but overall pretty good for a Goodwill. Everything is clean and organized. Selection is about average for a California branch, but less than I've found in other states. Books could use better organization, but seeing as how they're usually low on staff I can see how this would be less of a priority.</review>

<time>1534969465703</time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>The store is always completely trashed every time I go in there  And every time I come there's only ever at max 2 employees working the entire store ; More specifically today only one employee was helping customers.

I asked use the restroom and if I could leave my basket up at the register and she said yes but while I was in the register she allowed other customers to go through my basket and take my items. If you didn't wanna watch my basket you should have been honest and said no. She stood there and let it happened because she never left the register or moved from the spot she was standing at. Not cool.

Every time I come to the store it is always a problem or dirty and I just don't understand with as much money comes into your company that you can't staff this one properly. There are millions of people looking for jobs out there. Ugh.

I know nothing will ever be done about this!</text>< Pictures>

I donated 300+ DVDs. I was told I would get a receipt via e-mail. I NEVER did get a receipt. They still made money out of it, however I was not even able to claim it for taxes. That is dishonest, unethical and a shameful practice. Thieves.< /text>

They are overpriced for goodwill but still overall decent. The staff is always nice, but if they're closing and you need a dressing room, don't count on  any of the new(younger) chicks to cut out the gossiping and keeping to themselves long enough to help you. It's easiest just to walk to the front and ask.<//review>

Good selection of items, clean store, friendly staff. Only 4 stars, because the prices seem to be higher here, than at other goodwill stores. But it's still cheaper than buying from a retail store.< /Review>

I came to drop off some stuff for donations. I set one tote by the door and went to get the other and this lady came out and said that I couldn't drop off anything cause they were closed and I said ok I will get it. Then she just stared at with the door opened and said that I leave it I would get a ticket. I said ok I will get it but she continues to stare at me until I came and got the stuff. Then she closed the door and continued to stare until I got in my car . I felt I was treated rudely for no reason at all.<//Review>

<text>I have fun shopping at Goodwill. I wish they labeled the sizes more. It saves so much time for the shopper. It's like mental abuse to have to go in and look through every item of jeans, just to find your size. I have asked about this 3 other times but I go in there and it is still the same.Even just, small medium and Large is better than all thrown together. I'm just sayin'.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

The women that work here are lazy. I feel sorry for their husbands if they even have one. They have so much space for donations and reject donor after donor. One lady was working on all the donations alone while the manager and her little group hung out in the office joking around unprofessionally. You bring shame to the goodwill company.< /text>

<Text>The service is terrible at this location. I was in the store for two hours and had a cart full of items and no one offered me assistance even once. When I went to checkout the  manager told me to check out with a different clerk  at a different register cause she was busy... The clerk wasn't present and I had to wait. I had a cart full with 2 suit jackets that were on a rack marked "$9.99 jackets" and I had a suit with pants from a section that said "suits $19.99. also had picture frames, 4 hardcover books, a hat and some other items...
I asked if she would just leave the suit and jackets on the wood hanger they came with since I was traveling from out of state. I was told I couldnt have the hangers as she stuffed the suit jackets into a bag, wrinkled up...

For the record: when a customer is spending over $70 in your dirty goodwill store, it might be a good idea to work with people! I was very polite and asked her if perhaps her manager could make an exception. I then offered to buy the hangers with the suit items.

The manager returned and told me they would not make an exception, after I re explained I was traveling. i then agreed to purchase the suit and jackets without hangers anyway. I noticed the cashier rang up the two jackets for $19.99 each, the same ridiculous  price of the suit. I told her that wasn't correct. She voided the jackets and re rung them up at $12.99 each. I explained the huge sign on the wall where ALL the jackets were located stated $9.99. She said sports coats were extra. I told her that I was there in that section for over an hour and nowhere was any jacket priced $12.99. These clothes are donated and cost the store ZERO. I've given thousands of dollars to support Goodwill stores and this store jacks the price up on items in order to pocket the difference. I'll be writing to their headquarters in Southern California to give them my peace of mind. they really had zero Smiles on their face or any kind of consideration for customers. I argued my case that the jackets are not 12.99, she called the manager back over who said she was too busy to come over, would have to wait again.  Meanwhile a long line was forming and the cashier requested additional assistance. Nobody came to help her.  I apologized to everyone in line and said I'm "sorry to hold everyone up" but this is false advertising. Actually it's outright fraud and I wasn't about to tolerate any price fixing games. I told her I didn't want the suit anyway because she already stuffed them in the bags wrinkling them all up.  it was a miracle to even find a Calvin Klein suit jacket in great condition but I decided I would just buy a brand new One. Why support this business with its outrageous prices? I told her to take the suit jackets off my bill. She couldn't void the items without manager approval, so had to wait again. They are understaffed and I began to wonder about WHO owns this socal location and how much revenue actually goes to help people find jobs. After arriving back at my hotel I found two other items that were rung up incorrectly and I was overcharged by $5 on a hat and a book...
If I hadn't caught the extra $20 overcharge on the suit jackets I would have been over billed $25. I politely reminded the manager of the fact the signage stated $9.99 for jackets and was again told a big NO, she wouldn't do a thing for me. The store was dirty, unorganized and had stuff like clothing all over the floors.
Never once did the manager say please understand... Or explain anything with a smile... Truly pathetic service.
Stay AWAY... go to a better location Far AWAY.

I would give zero stars if possible. There is no excuse for treating customers that are supporting goodwill this way. I have receipts for thousands I've spent and donated to goodwill industries and can prove my support has been substantial... If nothing is done after filing a formal complaint with the company, I will be left with no choice other than filing with the AG to alert them to this stores fraud and deceptive practices.< /Text><userid>102580560562391368694</userid><resp>None<//resp><pictures>None< /pictures>< rate>

Awful customer service. I walked in on 9/12/16 at 9:40am and the girl at the counter just glared at me and right after some white guy walked in and she greeted him. Then she proceeded to follow me around the store. I was planning on buying a lot of stuff but changed my mind because all their employees are awful. If you're young and colored dont go here. They treat you like you're a criminal even though they get all they're clothes for free.</text>

<review>My package should of went here... But is on some wild ride from tehachapi past here to go to Stockton and is now at the sacramento hub. If you wanna know why it's there and not in my hands like it is supposed to be is because the sheer incompetence of this company. I have called them 6 times to tell them it's going way past my deliver point and they don't care. I'm guessing this how they get you and the fuel surcharge.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Package was sent up and down the state pass me half a dozen times. Customer service rep says it’s on truck to be delivered... delivery driver doesn’t have it. There is no way to get a hold of the facility to pick up my package. I will never use fed ex again.</Review><resp>None</resp></record>

<review>I agree with other reviews.  They don't make much of an attempt to get the package to the right place.  We found packages up to 1/2 mile from our house, in the dirt, part way in the road.  I found one I've been expecting for 3 weeks in a mail box.  ( Not ours). I didn't think Fed-x were supposed to us the US mail boxes.  When I call to try to get to the reason they are so terrible they say that I must complain to Walmart. (Try getting anywhere with them).  There is never a bill or account of what has shipped or their half a___ attempt to deliver.  I've no idea what has been stolen, returned or never arrived.  These companies that are doing a lot business because of the Chinese 😷 flu will not let you choose who delivers your parcels.  I'm tired of it.  Carol< /review>< pics>

Horrible!! I PAID $30 to have  packaged delivered to my son. Driver refused to follow delivery notes to call and comply with covid delivery instructions for resident dorm hall at Reedley College.
I had to drive over 200 miles from Palmdale to pick up the package and deliver to my son my self!! Unacceptable<//Text>

<text>How was FedEx Ground? Well.....I had TWO packages in the warehouse and only ONE got on the truck for delivery. I went to the warehouse to pick it up in person and the representative said "I don't know where it is, if I find it before Tuesday, ill give you a call" (Today is saturday). I don't have anything nice to say at this point considering this is now the FIFTH package they've "lost" in their own facility. You can form your own opinion off of my experience.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Ive had a package sitting at this distribution center for almost 3 weeks. I called Fedex customer service over a week ago and I still dont have my package. I live inside Sequoia national park and theyre claiming they cant deliver it due to "local weather delays" which is BS because there is no snow on our road into the park, our park is OPEN, my place of employment in the park is OPEN AND HAS RECEIVED OTHER FEDEX DELIVERIES but for whatever reason they dont just send it to VISALIA to be shipped into the park. My tracking shows it scheduled for delivery every day, then NOT EVEN ATTEMPTED due to this BS weather delay.< /review>

<review>Had a package supposed to be delivered today (Sept 14, 2020) via Amazon tracking. Was home all day watching. No driver showed up, no door knock, but it says delivered. NO PACKAGE.

Had another problem a couple weeks ago. Took the drivers three tries...the first two attempts failed, stating business closed (the shipping address IS A HOUSE), and the third driver said that the other guy did not know where my house was (got GPS? Google Maps?).<//review>< pictures>

Tracking showed the package was "out for delivery" Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday so Thursday at 2:00 I went to get it and, after waiting for more than an hour, they said they couldn't find it. But the manager said the night shift would find it and he would personally deliver it. We'll see.< /Review>

Absolutely the worst shipping company all the way around.  Incompetence, lack of customer service, always late and complete disregard for any customers time and money.  On more than 6 occasions in a 30 day span FedEx has failed to deliver any of my packages on time or undamaged.  Well over $1000 in shipping cost and can't tell me where the packages are even though online it keeps saying out for delivery.  I am waiting on something that was suppose to be delivered on Monday and it's Thursday.  Status says out for delivery on truck and no one from the multiple countries FedEx uses for "customer service" can tell me where my package is.  Unreal.  I have $800 in claims and growing. Currently on hold once again wait to find out where my package is after 3rd day of "on the truck out for delivery" will never us FedEx again.< /Text>

I called twice in one day and the first lady assured and guaranteed me it would be delivered that day(Her name was June). Then I called later that day to confirm it was still on scheduled after it is already 5 days from the original delivery date and she told me it was still sitting in the warehouse and would be delivered tomorrow.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

< Review>
I have been waiting for a replacement Fitbit for weeks and the waiting time was 5-7 business days (sometime 10 depending on COVID delays), so I was patient, but once I saw the notifications over and over on the third week after its 10 days that it’s been in Fresno or is on a delivery truck. Each day it kept saying it would be delivered for a week, until on a Thursday they gave me the wrong package, someone’s else’s who lives in a DIFFERENT TOWN. I keep having to talk to different people with different answers having no idea where it has gone and keep saying it’s on a truck. One also said that it kept going on wrong route and that they eventually found the right one. Until I called the next day and they told me that no driver can find it nor can they find it in their warehouse. So I talk to the manager who seemed to be helpful, but absent-minded and a little careless as he didn’t really prioritize it and just gave me a generic call you on Monday, but forgot that It was LABOR DAY. This last Friday they sent someone to retrieve the wrong package but mine is nowhere in sight. So as of now, I’m waiting til tomorrow, but no need to receive my package to acknowledge that they are awful. DO NOT USE THIS FEDEX. I have an expensive Fitbit and they have most likely took to wrong place and no one has reported it stolen or has stolen it for themselves, so yeah I’m basically furious with this place... I would give it zero stars, but not possibly as you have to give one star to at least write a review.<//Review>

Shipped a package from Ohio to California. Took 3 days to get to California, which is expected. Then took another 3 days “in transit” in the city next to where it was located. One day late would’ve been okay, 3 days late after the item was literally right next door is not okay.<//review>

No way that this driver even attempted it. Fed ex has the laziest drivers that don’t care. Last time using fedex. It is UPS for now on! At least if I have a problem I can talk to someone locally unlike fedex you speak with someone in a different state.<//Text>< Response>

All the parking near the door is taken by the employees so it's a far walk for customers. This makes carrying packages, especially heavy or bulky, very difficult and physically exhausting. It took them over 1/2 hour just to find the 1 package I was picking up. The package weighed 60 pounds and they did not offer to assist taking it to customer parking nor the use of a dolly. I was there a total of 45 minutes just for one package and there was not even a line at the customer pickup office. These guys do not care at all about their customers. I'm fedup with FedEx.</text>

<review>FedEx has failed to deliver a package for 3 days now. They claim that there is a failed attempt because no one is home to sign the package. On my Camera there was never a FedEx employee ringing my doorbell or knocking. They just left and sign slip and drove off. So I sign the slip and the next day he comes and sees the slip gets in his truck and drives off. No package, no doorbell. So today i try to get ahold of our local distribution center and can't find a number except the robot phone number they provide you... which by the way doesn't get you anywhere. I finally got a hold of a representative who could only tell me they didn't know where my package is or when I will be delivered. She proceeded to tell me that they don't have a phone number for the distribution center or driver and that they have no way for tracking their drivers. I mean you are you serious! A international company can't keep track of their employees! I've been doing business with fedex for years and don't believe I will be working with them any longer.  I JUST WANT MY PACKAGE... I WILL EVEN COME GET IT MYSELF. If fedex had anything near the standards amazon or ups has then mabey they would be able to actually do their jobs. I will be filing a formal complaint against this driver and will be expecting my package soon.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Never had this experience where a FedEx driver lied and say they tried to attempt to deliver but no one is home , waited all day just to get that .
Some BS , checked my cameras and no FedEx person came 9:14 - 3:44 . Unprofessional . People rely on you guys to deliver packages and some can’t even do their jobs correctly .< /text>

Delivery service exceedingly POOR.  Driver notes in tracking system say he attempted delivery but no one home.  I was home ALL day and know for a FACT no attempt was made.  Also, no 1st attempt note/notice was left on door, further proving NO attempt to deliver was made.  From now on it's UPS no matter what.  They may be more expensive, but at least when I call Customer Service I will get answers LOCALLY and not get forwarded to GUATEMALA!!!!!<//text>

<review>I've had FedEx deliver to me before without any problems but today shows just how bad they can be. Almost just as bad as the UPS! Today was the worst delivery I've ever got. First delivery driver just tossed package at the door & walked off without knocking (this was witnessed by neighbor), second delivery driver punched the screen door & then tossed the tore/half opened package at the door "leaving a small but noticeable indent on my screen door" (this time witnessed by the mail carrier who was getting a signature from my neighbor for certified mail & as well as me.) My door was open but screen door closed & when I heard the bang I walked over to the door seeing him throw the package at my screen door & then drive off, not listening to a word I said when I opened the screen door. This is very inappropriate behavior for these  drivers to be doing to packages & I guess we just can't trust any delivery driver nowadays!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Very helpful when retrieving a package. This is not a normal FedEx store, it is a warehouse distribution center. So you can only pickup packages.</review>

If I could give Fedex 0 stars I would. They were supposed to deliver my package, but claimed my shipping address was incorrect and were not able to locate my home. I had to call customer service to confirm my address was indeed correct. They promised to have the package delivered the following day. It never came. I was going out of town for the weekend and had to call them to hold my package at a local facility. When I finally was able to pick up my package, the box was severely damaged.  I opened the top of the box to find that the product inside was damaged as well. Such a horrible delivery service. I will never use Fedex for any future delivery services! I filed multiple complaints online with Fedex and have yet to receive a response. Luckily the company I ordered my product from have great customer service and shipped out a new replacement through UPS!!</text>

Bought a TV through Walmart and I work during delivery hours. Asked if I could just pick it up at the store location and they told me Walmart has restrictions and then called Walmart and had them call fedex and they didn't know what they were talking about. So I have to wait an extra 3 days before I can pick up my own purchased item  and already paid for mailing.<//Review>

<text>Literally the worst shipping company ever. Bought a coffee table and recieved the legs when the delivery man dropped off the package he said my package had not left the warehouse because it was damaged so fed had to inspect box. Call fed ex and they tell me that the package is on the delivery man trucks and that he would turn around to drop the second part to my package day ends no show. Call fed ex get a very rude ansawer from a lady not willing to listen to me telling her that my package didn't get delivered and she just began telling me you accepted the package and asking me who I talked to. Like no I accepted a coffee table with just legs and no top, she said I cant do nothing at this point call Monday. I asked her for a name or reference so I would not have to go to the hassle of talking to someone else and having to explain the situation after much argument she says her name is adriana which i think she just gave me a fake name. Point blank is they do not know what they are doing worst shipping experience of my LIFE. stay away from this shipping company or specially this location. Payed 20 dollers in shipping to get my package lost and to go through the hassle of all this.< /text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) You have two days with the package, and it has not been delivered. Today according to reports the driver tried to make the delivery. Which is false. My wife and I are home at that time.

<text>Listen up!! The special adults work like slaves here🤦‍♀️, you go you see them cleaning their cars, access buses, rooms, etc. Very inconsiderate about their opinions and feelings, I mean don't you wanna take your special to child to a foundation or place where they feel happy or at home or something that is very beneficial for them where they can learn and grow? Not here, I mean unless you're just trying to have the special adult occupied or out of your way then this is the place for you. But I want my special child to learn not be their slaves. They never have any days off, it seems like they just want to keep these special adults occupied with something useless to do.  I understand that some of these Special adults can be hard to control but I guess you just need patience with them, no patience at all here. I rather travel my a**  to find another foundation.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>I don't know much about this foundation but I didn't have a good first impression nor experience. I met with Ana A. today to discuss the services that they offer for adults with developmental disabilities and it was a waste of my time. What's frustrating is the fact that a lot of what Ana discussed could've been communicated over the phone. The main issue is that Ana spoke about some of the services that they offered but left out a few important details till the end of the meeting. Not aware of the services schedule and availability, I agreed to allow my adult brother to take an school assessment and waited to only be told that they couldn't accommodate my brother because he needed to do the program M-F which is truly overwhelming for someone like him if he's going to school and working part-time. The issue is NOT the fact that they didn't have flexibility, but the fact that the worker didn't communicate this info from the beginning. How do I expect this foundation to teach my brother communication when I can't get that from the worker? And, she downplayed the fact that she didn't communicate and said I'm sorry you can't get the program that you would like. No, it's frustrating that I wasted my time and I have to go back to apply for a new vendor when I was not aware that this was a M-F program from the start of the meeting and after taking an assessment. Especially when I made it very clear of our situation. Thanks Tierra De Sol, moving on.....< /text>< pics>

A lot better than the major restaurant depot locations. Smaller yet seem to always have items in stock. Staff is always friendly, especially the ones at check out. I try to come get more often than Van Nuys location.</review>

They need more people and they need to clean up the place and be more friendly because they are very bad and close that place up because alot of people got covid 19 and when people got covid 19 they don't close that place to clean and people still shop there is very poor and I will not work there because the place is very dirty< /Text>

<Text>Today I went in to buy items as one of the public. My friend who was with me has a restaurant, but isn't a member. We within the same day returned to exchange or return item. They said sales are finale to the Public Only. We were told it is posted everywhere. Which is a lie. They don't explain that or have any signs telling you it's a final sale! They only write it on your receipt! I will report to the Better Business Bureau. This is not the way to treat people during these difficult times! By the way we just left the item there! We won't be back.< /Text>< Pictures>

My thoughts is the front entrance could be amazing there seems to be unfocused or lack of focus on making the entrance nice clean etc..the trees and plants are either neglected or have died just lack of cleanliness and detail..look you guys are always busy you could spend a hundred bucks a month to fix it up..they won't they don't care like much of the people today they'll complain they don't get paid enough to worry about the entrance sad..you should if you run the place sad..
Also this place doesn't always have clean ailes and bathrooms look into management again they ain't doing there jobs..either way if you have a card you buy things you need most people that come here don't have a food company that drops off which I do..I use this in a pinch and it's fine..easy in easier out..good place bad management.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Time>

I am now  (8/2/2018) disappointed with restaurant depot. They have discontinued the products I use and are forcing to use products I don't want to use at higher costs. The buyers of this place are NOT consumer sensitive. Guess they don't live in the real world. Hence I am lowering the stars from 5 to 1. This doesn't reflect the good service the manager and employees give me.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2dca12405b7e9:0xfe6069b6512bf2b4< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

No stars. This company is ruthless towards delivery drivers. Three or more hour wait even with appointment and on time. All locations, Colton and Torrance are even worse. They treat drivers almost like criminals, intruders or less than human. Be warned, charge accordingly.< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I think you will see my review, because you also search the smog check from google and saw the ads. The coupon looks really good.  There are several coupon for the same place. When I realized that, I want to use the cheaper one. They refused that. And I didn't pass the smog check. Because the computer of the car isn't ready. I need drive for a while. And I need to pay for re-test because I used the coupon. when you paid a higher price, you got free re-test.
You know they are the expert. They can easily know that your car is not ready by using the obo meters and let you test later.
Today, I choose another place for smog check, they help me to figure out whether I can do the smog check for my car.
The experience is very bad. you can choose another place if you can.
They just want to earn money. Because you do not do smog check every day.</Text><Name>Kevin Li</Name>< GmapID>

I went there when I was buying car. They inspected everything about the car, and gave me inspection report. They also did an oil change for very reasonable price. It was great service. Thanks to them. I would recommend to anyone who needs maintenance for their car.</Text>

I went for an oil change for my 2004 Toyota Camry and I got a fast and clean service. They also detected a few problems and quickly resolved the issue. The rack and pinion power steering unit were defective, and they fixed the issue in less than a day. This place is quick, fast and reliable. Definitely recommend it for anyone. The price is well within reason.< /Text>

<text>These guys are really good! I brought my car in to replace a broken taillight, not only were they able to do it at a great price, they were able to provide a fix the next day, AND cleaned up my bumper from where the car was busted without me asking for it (the bumper looks almost as good as new)!

THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!

I found these guys by chance because I went to another smog which was the rudest it the world (see my other 1 Star review)
I just googled the nearest place and was fortunate enough to get these guys. Same low price (probably the lowest you'll find!) and top notch service.
Excellent service, almost no wait time (and if you need to wait they'll take down your phone number with a smile and call you when the car is ready)
Honestly have nothing to say but the best things!
Thank you Aibrahim and thank you to the mechanic who took the smog. You guys are great! Top notch service, nice , explaining and they even did something extra for me and gave me a tip about the car. If you live in the area -- THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE YOUR SMOG PLACE :)</review>

I have had multiple service work done here over the years. I live in the same neighborhood and the owner is very service oriented. He is honest straightforward and trustworthy. I told him to do whatever it needed to my daughters car. He gave it an oil change and told me everything else was good. Thanks Arnel<//Review>

We took our 04 and 07 Toyota Camrys to this auto shop and I have never seen such honesty and craftsmanship! Their service was well done and the owners seemed much more friendlier than the other auto shop I went to. I got a price from the other shop and when compared to this one, there was significant difference. This place was cheaper and had the same amount of work put in. They were very experienced and told me that the part that I needed to replace could be reused. Overall, the service was well and the repair was above satisfaction! I wish people wrote more reviews such as mine so that we could keep the honest businesses in our area</Review>

If you know nothing about cars, this place will scam you with tons of hidden fees. After you leave your car, expect a call from Annel telling you, your new estimate just went from $150 to $680 because he needs special tools to remove 6 bolts.. what a joke. Take your car elsewhere.<//Review>

My husband has been here lots of times while traveling for business but this was my first time. They serve wonderfully fresh and delicious fish in a very traditional atmosphere that is lovely. We eat a lot of sushi and sashimi and really appreciate how fresh and beautiful their fish is. I cannot wait to return. I’m not sure what the unfavorable reviews are but suspect people may want a flashier place but this restaurant isn’t about that. It’s about quality and serving beautiful food.<//Text>

<Text>Indoor dining!  Some of the best Japanese food I have ever had.  Great location.  Someday when the cable cars are running again 😥 they will go right by.  Very reasonable prices.  Large portions.  Great lunch special.  Great wine list which can be uncommon in a Japanese restaurant for some reason.  Friendly and efficient staff.

3 stars because of the front desk lady.
She is very rude, literally from on the phone to off. You call to order and she hangs up immediately after you stop talking, doesn’t give a price, doesn’t ask for your name, doesn’t confirm order or anything.

I ordered fried sushi it was good but the service from this lady who answers the phone is ridiculous.

They got my order correct and she I sited it was my fault, when if she would have confirmed my order she would have known what I ordered.< /Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Fantastic sushi at this rather dim lit, no frills, yet authentic Japanese decor Sushi Bar. Located right off of Union Square in San Francisco, with late hours, it is a great option when downtown. Extremely fresh seafood with a unique menu of fusion rolls, served by a friendly staff and very reasonable prices; this place is a definite winner among the zillions of sushi bars in SF.

Oysters and wakame were simply delicious, tempura rolls served at proper temperature, great flav profiles. 👍🏽

Would highly recommend.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUnVJB0Kco-SwTsWFbw6S0E5zj_F1aR5Gut28=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY6Oaiqn9X85zrTMaWPQiqt0QoQ2mYL7QNew4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCTKs3UfXfwssjgEdXoI1IxHsD2uXchUWfMJE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiYAoEZ5z8VKx9Z9lhoFPQaLZqHiGX6ZPpFhk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObPPb_dxRLFQy7iNaXhiQhgd05cCqF1aLftlY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1bcti0HVFT9IihaqxndpYr3N77xgQ4voVoes=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

Popped in here for a quick bite, so only had 1 roll. Fish quality was terrific, and price was good too. Definitely a good spot to visit when in SF and looking for sushi. Also had nice ambiance.</text>

<review>To start, the price is great. Its surprisingly affordable for the area of town it's in. The food is good, and the service is attentive. I started with mixed tempura, which was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Next was chicken teriyaki, which was good, but the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I felt like the sauce was solid but not great, and I would have liked to see more vegetables worked in. That said, great meal, and well presented.<//review>< userid>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I have this sushi resturaunt in my "top favorites of all time" category. It's really fresh, the service is great and staff is friendly and accommodating. The only complaint-type of concern I could give if I had to: is for staff to label the food packaging so that the customer can identify what they're eating. My man has a food allergy which made guess work a challenge when it came to seeing that his order wasn't contaminated with the allergen. We ordered the Volcano roll(my fav of favs), Yummy yummy roll, Powell roll, Bay scallop roll, Spicy scallop handroll, Jalepeño bomb, LaBamba roll (least fav of all the favs), Nameko soup, and Tonkatsu Ramen. And a last minute addition to the other for one of my kids was Chicken Karaage. We are sushi fanatics but have been obsessing over these baked rolls lately and mayyyybe overindulging but im happy when I eat sushi- so sue me. This place is worth returning to and definitely on my recommendations list as an accomplished reviewer.;P
Btw, apologies for having no food left to take pictures for you all to drool over but I will update and include next time because there will be a next time♡+.</Review>< Pictures>

Sushi was really good but expensive. The platter below costs 30 USD. This however, isn't why I chose to rate this Japanese restaurant two stars. A friend of mine, who ordered the beef teriyaki and a california roll was treated like garbage. His beef was very chewy. Not a problem, can happen. Everyone makes mistakes. Also his california roll was forgotten. Another friend also didn't get all of his orders. But when made notice to the very unfriendly waitress of these unpleasant issues, she just kind of turned us away and basically said we we're making a scene out of nothing. That is not how a host treats his customers.

So waitress, if you're reading this. You and your restaurant suck<//Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Resp>None< /Resp><text>Not such a good experience. Food was nothing special. About the service, after ordering several items for myself, we started our meal with the initial items served. While waiting for the last of what I had ordered, I asked who appeared to be the owner or manager about when my final dish was coming. She went back to ask our waiter about it; she came back to tell me that I did not order that. Really? I didn’t order what I know I ordered and what my company heard me order, especially since we discussed that I’d order that very thing?!?Writing this, I’d originally had it 3 stars. Dropping to 2 since I realize that interaction was insulting. There could have been an apology that maybe she just didn’t hear me; but it was nothing like that. It was a simple “she said you didn’t order that.”< /text><UserId.>115122118948501365043< /UserId.>< Name>

The Sashimi was excellent...hamachi and sake (salmon) could not be fresher. The uni may be the best I've had, and I complimented the chef on it. Normally it would come from the Fort Bragg area but this was sourced in Alaska due to waves in NoCal that stopped divers. Presentation here is simple but the quality is very good.</Text>

Good Japanese little place, the fish always taste and look so fresh. I feel they really put love in their food, usually go for lunch when Im working, could be a bit busy but once you get your order you forget about the little wait, at nights its perfect for date night or a casual dinner with friends. Simply really GOOD.<//Review>

Sushi was okay - not the greatest that I’ve ever had, but they did offer a decent selection of speciality rolls.  The Lunch Bento was given to us around 3pm which was helpful.  The service was very quick and attentive!<//review>

Would certainly come back, if wanting sushi lunch. Not suitable if wanting to impress clients or for special occasion dinner.< /text>< pictures>

Only gets a two because the food tasted good. Service really bad. Waited over 15 min once seated before anyone came to acknowledge us. Waitress really rude.

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>The food was great.  Service was good.  The nigiri proves were a little high.  $20 for uni seems a bit steep, but it was the same price as Otoro which seemed a little odd.  I initially went there because I saw salmon and tuna donburri for around 12 bucks.  At the restaurant I found out they don't have those and the closest thing was the chirashi don.  It was good but was around $26.  A little misleading.  Bottom line, it was good and the people and atmosphere were what you'd expect at a sushi joint in SFO.  I recommend this place.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQaFQl4vFR0DWM2J4VR4_aVov6bicaTEVhROZH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqzEoYz1Zk9BmhzIhzmjqV95DEGww_cMPv7uGh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x8085808e9e1a51db:0xd486e0adbedd707d<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>It was seeming a good family-run restaurant. Tables and restrooms are just clean.

I ate a Lion King sushi and drunk a cup of Matcha tea.

Also I believe they have one of the healtiest menu in this area..</Review>< pics>

<Review>Reviews look good. I am not a picky eater. Tuna fillet on top had lots of connective tissue attached to it, and had no texture. Poor quality tuna that day. It was kind of like having extremely soft mashed potatoes in your mouth. I had one bite of my roll and asked for my check. Ended up having to pay $23 for my. I think they should have at least taken the roll off my bill. Gave two stars instead of one because it was quick service.< /Review>< Pics>

Overrated. The prices are super steep for what you get. Ordered the 6 sushi and 6 sashimi for $30 and both things were super dry and stale. This inevitably added to the lack of flavour too. The service leaves so much to be desired. The staff are rushing to remove plates from your table and threw the bill on the table before we had even finished our dinner. The service varies per table. I wouldn’t come here again. I’d just go Super Duper burger instead.< /text>

Three item bento box was HUGE! Tempura and chicken teriyaki was great. Sashimi was small and would probably pick something else if I could do it again. But overall great value for money. I went here a little past 11 for lunch and it was me and another table. Not crowded at all and food was out quickly.< /Review>

Terribly slow service and everyone does not receive nearly the same level of service. This took away from the experience greatly! The food was actually good...once we got it.

We came here on a Sunday around 3pm; they weren’t too busy as far as traffic as only about half of the restaurant was occupied, maybe less.
There were at least 3 other parties; 2 parties of 2, and a party of 1 that came after us that received quicker service. I’m talking about they had their full meals and were leaving by the time we received our entrees.

Our waitress did warn us that there was only one sushi chef working that day so the rolls would take a bit longer; understood. We ordered 1 sushi roll; just one! However, we watched people who had came in after us receive their rolls from the sushi bar and we were sitting right in front of the chef, so we knew when he called out each table number that was ready.

Our miso soup came 10 minutes apart from each other, so I watched my coworker finish hers and waited for mine. No kidding when I say we waited another 30 minutes just to get our salads! When we finally got our entrees a party of 4 had come in and sat next to us. We watched as they were checked on often and received their appetizers in a very timely manner. And would you believe they received 2 sushi rolls from the sushi bar and then our 1 roll came right after they received theirs and we finished our entrees!

They clearly did not think we were important enough to check on and receive our food according to a queue. I have my thoughts on why WE weren’t prioritized, but I’ve shared enough on our experience. My coworker and I won’t be returning.< /review>

Really mediocre sushi for premium prices. Sushi was a bit tough and the portions were kind of small.

For a table of four, our order arrived one-by-one over the course of 30 minutes. Half of the table was finished before one person received their order. The last person to receive their order had to eat with everyone else finished.

There is no way I'd visit this place twice.</Text>

I stopped in 15 minutes before close, ordered one maki roll to go. The roll was great. Although the shrimp tempura tail sticking out the ends of the roll was excessively long, lol.

Fresh, good sushi.  Not the most imaginative rolls or anything, but the three different kinds of toro they had this evening more than made up for it.  The oysters were also yummy and fresh.</review>

<Review>A great sushi spot just a brief walk away from Union square. The prices are fair even for the touristy area that it is in and service is good too though can be a little slow at peak hours. The sushi selection is standard and of good quality. They have other Japanese basics on the menu too. Overall a nice place for a family dinner or even an informal catch up as you watch tourists and  the cable car jingle by outside ...</Review><response>None<//response>< user_name>

Service seemed a bit slow compared to my favorite place back home, but the toro tuna and salmon were worth the wait. The Alaskan king crab roll didn't hurt the situation either. Sushi nigiri portions were definitely of decent size. Tuna , salmon, mackerel, butter fish and of course the toro pieces were all good quality.</Review>

<review>Spent there 15 minutes to see the server, than another 30(!!!) to get my order, well, part of it - they missed on appetizer and soups, but surely didn’t forget to include them in the check. Not to mention everything was served barely warm.

This place is actually the best.  We came on a saturday, typically the day to avoid sushi based on delivery typicals for fresh fish to the city, but let the old wives tales be debunked.  Albacore 2 piece - amazing, hamachi toro - amazing, and salmon skin handroll, well, never had better!  And I grew up in hawaii, have been to Japan, and have been to what LA and SF claim are the best places.  We also left with a tab well under 100 after getting so full we needed wheelbarrows and got a few beers and sake to add.  Would recommend to anyone.  Sit at the sushi bar, but honestly service is good enough you can sit anywhere and have a good time<//review>

We were sitting for more than 15 minutes before a server came to the table, and it was to ask us to move to another table to accommodate another customer. Took another few minutes after the move to order anything. They then brought out all the food on one plate (???). By the time I could get a waitress to bring another plate the other person I was with had finished her two rolls. They also never brought us the water we asked for. Food was decent.< /review>

<Text>I dropped into Maru as I was walking up Powell St and thought it looked like a nice place. The decor is clean and there's a nice atmosphere.

I was greeted warmly by the staff and seated at the sushi bar where I made conversation with one of the chefs.

Once my sushi was prepared the chef handed it to me over the counter. I have to say I was blown away by the quality. The sushi was beautifully made, and the fish tasted very fresh, unlike some other places I've been.

Fantastic experience with the food, I just wish the service had been more attentive, but it was quite busy and there were some large tables so I'll forgive them.< /Text><userid>118015284066716762793< /userid>< pics>

If going there ask for the spicy ramen... it’s super tasty and huge... I would say that it’s a shareable portion. And the best of all, affordable pricing.<//Text>

<Review>Good food, okay service, bad maintenance. The sushi was good, but the oysters were a little sour. The waitress was nice, and we got the food a little while after we ordered. The tables were sticky, causing some glasses to spill when you try to pick them up. Overall a good experience. Only thing that could be improved is cleaning.<//Review>< pictures>

Love their "Brandon" sushi rolls. I also like that they let me switch brown rice in place of white. Great portion, fairly priced, vast selection and oh so yummy sushi! My only Regret is that I live in  San Francisco,and this place is really out of the way.< /text>

Service is fine. Pricing is comparable to area. Table was dirty. I ordered Sashimi having enjoyed it so often in London. It was terrible. I was then informed I was mistaken, as it had been delivered that morning. I was refused a refund and was dealt with contempt. My friends enjoyed their food. I suggest you walk on as, should you not enjoy your meal, you risk being scorned by an unreasonable and aggressive host.< /Review>

<review>We were staying close by for 10 days in The City and ate here three times. We were delighted each time by reasonably priced sushi and sashimi, and as I am a vegetarian I was very happy to find a good (if not extensive) selection of California Rolls and other dishes which contained no fish. Highly recommended.</review>< Response>

I was surprised how much I ended up liking this place! Was passing by it after an evening stroll along union square and thought I grab a quick bite to eat. Not normally the biggest fan of sushi (I find it often a little too bland and mild for my liking), but found the dishes served here to be quite tasty and flavourful. Staff were really friendly and the overall establishment very pleasant.<//Review>

Ok sushi, but a bit expensive for what you get. Maybe just typical for S.F. tho.<//Text>

Tourists who brave the hillsides of the Union Square vicinity will be rewarded by this Japanese eatery. The interior is reminiscent of a traditional sushi restaurant in Japan, and there's plenty to choose from the offerings of sushi, bento and dinner items. Sit at the bar to watch the sushi chefs skillfully prepare your sushi, or grab a booth for a more private setting.<//text>

< Review>
After the first disappointing visit i thought i would give them another chance. Bad mistake. The sushi/ sashimi here is old and dry, dull and dreary. The venue certainly looks the goods with lords of red lanterns and timber but don't be fooled, the guy chopping at the raw fish with a chef's knife is no talented expert and the lack - lustre meat he fumbles onto the plate wouldn't qualify as sushi grade in most countries. Do yourself a huge favor and walk 20 metres up the hill, turn left and eat at Toni Sushi like the locals - they know...</Review>

<Review>Lively, decent decor place. Way overpriced sashimi. It's already $2.66 per piece, and they wanted to scam me with a $4 surcharge for all salmon -- the cheapest fish out of the usual tuna, hamachi. Almost no sushi place globally does that, definitely not in the Bay Area where I frequent lots of sushi places.
There's another place literally 200 feet away, and they're not scammin' for salmon.<//Review>< pictures>

This place has a great atmosphere.
Since I'm not really a fan of sushi, I had the Yaki Udon, and it was the best udon I have ever had.
Staff was really friendly and prices were reasonable.< /text>

<response>None</response><text>The 5 star reviews on here must be from people who have never had sushi.

First of all, it took 20 minutes after sitting down to even get a wait-staff's attention to take our order. Even after we told the waitress we were ready to order, she STILL didn't take our order.

Then we were served a miso soup and salad. 1, for two people. Since many restaurants serve these with rolls, we asked if we should have gotten 2 of each. Instead, the waitress took the food (that had been there for a good 4 minutes without any supervision!) off of our table and served it to the table next to us!!! What!? That is definitely not up to any code. Ugh.

Then we received two rolls. They were both... Fine. One was one of the acclaimed "baked" rolls that got positive reviews on here. They were tasteless at best, bad tasting in some bites. I asked for no tobiko and got rolls with tobiko. We ordered edamame and literally didn't get it. When we mentioned that when we got the bill, the waitress brought it - as if we wanted it then?! The third too we got was slightly better than fine - it has scallops on it (not baked) - which warmed this review one extra star.

There are plenty of sushi restaurants around the area. I would suggest you go to a different one.<//text><gmapID>0x8085808e9e1a51db:0xd486e0adbedd707d< /gmapID><date>1514606965387< /date>< pics>

BEWARE! The prices listed on Google Maps' menu section are NOT accurate. This restaurant is much more expensive than listed here (e.g. Gyoza are $8, not $3.75). Other than the bait-and-switch with prices, it is a decent sushi place.<//review>

<Review>TL;DR - Ripped off, poor service, lied to, awful food :(

My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant after looking up the menus online, and we checked the menus outside the restaurant on Thanksgiving Day (it was closed for the holiday). The menus posted outside and online were the same. When we visited the restaurant the next day the menus seemed to be different, so I asked the waitress if they had changed their menus. She told us that nothing had changed, but asked me to show the menu I had seen online. When I showed it to her, she immediately broke into a loud outburst (which every nearby table could overhear) telling me that there was no way the restaurant could continue serving fish at such a price. That doesn't bother me - we're happy to order off the updated menus, but she didn't need to make such a scene.

We ordered 1 order (2 pieces each) of toro, maguro, halibut, and uni. The halibut and uni were listed as market price, while the toro and maguro were around $6.50 - $7.00 each. Then, we ordered 6 pcs. of oysters (around $14.00) and one order of ebi tempura ($8.50).
- Ebi tempura: only 3 pieces for $8.50? Nothing was of epic high quality, so we didn't appreciate the portion size. This seemed too high for some simple tempura.
- 6 pc. oysters: they served it to us at the end of the meal when the ice bed under the oysters had already melted. This means that they had waited for quite a while before serving us the oysters. The (tiny) oysters were drowning in an overpowering, acidic sauce. I didn't even want to finish the order.
- The sushi was bad, too. The quality of the fish did NOT seem exceptional or even average. It was under-average. The uni was especially bad. We felt sick all day after eating it. The waitress had advertised the uni and halibut as being especially fresh and highly recommended we order it.

Aside from the sub-par food, the worst part of our experience was what happened when we got our bill. It was around $85 (up to $90+ with tip) for 8 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, and 6 tiny oysters. This is ridiculous. When we asked for our itemized receipt, we noticed that the halibut and uni had been listed as $20 EACH. This is $20 for 2 PIECES of sushi while the other sushi prices were nowhere close. We have previously dined at highly rated sushi restaurants in other parts of Canada and the US, and this price (for sushi) was even beyond what we paid at luxurious, high-end sushi restaurants. We don't mind spending the money for quality, we love sushi! We asked our waitress what happened with the bill, and she went on another rampage, talking about the shortage of fish in the USA and the high price of toro and how hard it was to catch fish. Umm.... if that's really the case, then why haven't the prices at the other restaurants risen so high? She kept arguing without listening to what we had to say - we never raised our voices or said anything rude, and politely tried to explain our confusion. She wouldn't listen and didn't budge.

I didn't really want to write such a negative review - I know that restaurants struggle, and that business is hard - but we would have appreciated more courtesy and transparency, as well as more honesty from the waitress.

Specific requests for the restaurant:
- Update your online menus.
- Be transparent about how much "market price" means. If a guest orders something that is listed as "market price", it is common courtesy to inform them of the price.
- Don't complain about how hard it is to catch fish when someone is confused about their bill.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The best food they have to offer is the Nabeyaki Udon during lunch or the bento box special (2-3 items + salad, soup, and rice). Everything else they have is too pricey for any casual meal.

The waitstaff is nice and free fast wi-fi is available, perfect for a quick upscale lunch.

AVOID THEIR RAMEN AT ALL COSTS</Text>

<text>The waitress' all suck. We ordered water and tea. They came with the tea but forgot all our water. They went and took our orders for food and I told her my order and she looked right at me and was standing right next to me. We ended up getting a different waitress cuz the other one couldn't handle it I guess. She was forgetting who had what and forgot some of our salads and soup. They had organization and memorization problems. My aunt ordered shrimp tempura but the gave her just the tempura instead which is a different order. She had to take it back but when they came with the bill they charged us for it. They overcharged us. I had to wait 3 hours for my food because the waitress said I didnt order when I clearly did but whatever. She was still going to charge me for the food though, but I found a bug in swimming in it. So after 3 hours of waiting I get a bug in my food. They went and made my food free and gave us icecream in componsation, but they should have gave us a discount. Worst place ever.< /text>< pics>

Sushi range was good overall and freshly made. However, the tonkotsu ramen was probably the worst I have had in years, avoid.

Free Wi-Fi is good for visitors, use VPN over it ;-)<//review>

Visited this restaurant 12 times over a span of 3 weeks on a business trip.
Although two Japanese restaurants were just a stone's throw to where I was staying (Nikko), I kept going back to this Korean-ran restaurant.

Why?
Friendly staff, and more importantly, consistently high food quality.
Dojima Ann (same value comparison) OTOH, had great location but wasn't consistent - slices of sashimi were quartered when it was busy.

The items that I had, by frequency -
* Chirashi
* Sashimi Combo Deluxe< /text>

Average restaurant, looked like the waiters were busy but no idea with what since there weren't too many people there when we arrived. Took a while before our food was served and was still pretty pricey.< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It's delicious here. I stayed at a nearby hotel, so I packed it and ate it, but it was so delicious, so I packed the same thing again. What we ate was Sushi Deluxe, and there were 8 pieces of sushi and 6 rolls, but the seasoned rice was just right, the seaweed was so delicious, and the sashimi was thick. The kind was not special, but the quality was good. The boss ran it with pride. It's been a long time since I ate delicious sushi and rolls. If you live around here, I think you will come often. I added 2 pieces of salmon separately.

여기 맛있어요. 주변 호텔에서 묵어 가까운 곳이라 포장해와서 먹었는데 넘맛있어서 똑같은거 또 포장해왔어요. 저희가먹은건 스시디럭스였고 다양한스시 8피스와 롤6개가 나오는데 밥에 간이 딱맞고 김이 너무 맛있고 회도 두툼해요. 종류가 특별한 회는 아니었는데 퀄리티 좋았어요. 사장님이 자부심갖고 운영하시더라고요. 오랜만에 맛있는 스시랑 롤 먹었네요. 여기 주변 산다면 종종 올 것 같아요. 연어2피스는 따로 추가한거에요.<//Text>< username>

(Translated by Google) Very good sushi especially without being too loaded with rice without any poisons as could happen, but here it is well balanced and fresh.

Sashimi line is good. It's more than halfway.

(Translated by Google) The restaurant is quite spacious but a bit noisy.
The waitresses are not smiling, however they are attentive to the slightest need.
We had 2 pasta dishes of a reasonable amount. However, the prices are too expensive !!
In addition to that, we were forced to adjust the tip when we did not want to do it.

(Original)
Le restaurant à assez spacieux mais un peu bruyant.
Les serveuses sont peu souriantes toutefois elles sont à l'écoute du moindre besoin.
