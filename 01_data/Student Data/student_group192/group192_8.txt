<text>I'm happy that this stayed open during the lockdown. I understand how dangerous that can be, but the staff actually cleans and ensures the safety of their members. So I am happy for the mental health and physical well being of the staff and members. Prior to the pandemic, the place has always been clean, up to date equipment and different places equipment is being moved.</text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rate>

Want you to sign up for their challenge when their not ready for their challenge. I was supposed to get a food log/journal at sign up to get NOTHING. It was ordered my second week of class. Went in to be weighed and I was asked if I had been logging my food when I didn’t have what was necessary to LOG. Ridiculous and a joke not to mention they do not have enough weights available for everyone in the class.< /review>< Pics>

The staff is nice and extremely knowledgeable. The gym itself is always very clean. There are plenty of sanitizer stations which are checked and refilled regularly.</Text>

The staff! They are crazy awesome, they know everybody by name and greet them, and from my personal experience they make the best of buddies too.

<Text>I have been to over 30 different Anytime Fitness gyms across America.  The manager at the Rancho Cordova, CA gym was the most rude manager I have met yet to date.  Not only did I not feel welcome at the gym but she was rude to many of the other gym patrons as well.  There seem to be a few gym patrons that the manager was nice to, but to many others she was not polite.  One time there were a few of us who were stretching in the studio room when she came into the room and told us we had to get out because a class was starting.  When someone politely pointed out that the class didn't start until 5:15 pm and it was only 5 pm, she said they had to get the room ready for the class.  Her response was curt and not friendly.  I stopped patronizing this location and now belong to a competing gym nearby.   I recommend to the owner of this Anytime Fitness to either send the manager for additional training or fire her.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Beware when signing into a contract as there are hidden fees and the customer service is awful. I have had multiple issues with billing since becoming a member and no one has assisted me. I keep being referred to a third party to handle which is an automated system and very difficult to work with. You can definitely find a better gym in the area with less hassle, similar pricing with likely more amenities, and friendlier service.< /Text>

<name>Melissa Hall<//name><rate>1</rate><text>We are members of the Cave Creek, AZ AF gym and we absolutely love it. We are visiting family in Rancho Cordova, CA so we wanted to use the local AF gym. The guest door was locked even during office hours. The lady working came and unlocked the door but said this door is for guests. I had my fob but my husband left his in AZ so he came through the membership door with me and we went straight to the guest office for him to check in. We were then reprimanded for entering the gym this way. We were not welcomed or treated with respect but rather felt very unwelcome. She went on about how we need to wait outside the door for her to let us in and was very rude. The gym also had makeshift signs taped up all around with obvious gym rules that were almost insulting as a member. Equipment was plentiful but very cramped and poorly organized. We can’t wait to return to our AF at Cave Creek in AZ!</text></record>

<review>BEST GYM EVER!!!! I am so happy I joined here - it has been a breath of fresh air from the mega-gym experience. PRIVATE BATHROOMS WITH SHOWER, need I say more? EVERYONE there is super nice, friendly, helpful, accommodating, and fun! Nice to go to any state or place 24/7 and just swipe in the front door. Perfect for travel.  Seems like they keep adding more equipment and changing things up. This location has all kinds of extra stuff for people into TRX, heavy bag, speed bag, etc. Lots of classes too.<//review>< UserId.>

Best Anytime Fitness I've ever seen! Michele, the manager, and Kevin, the owner, are absolutely awesome! It's the cleanest gym I've ever been in, has new equipment, has great trainers, and attentive management! I would give six stars if I could. They have equipment that some of the biggest gyms don't have. If you are rude and disrespectful DO NOT GO HERE, you will ruin the awesome vibe.  If you haven't been to this gym before then just go check it out for yourself, you can thank me later ;)<//review>

Just moved to the neighborhood. My wife and I went to inquire about joining.  We were greeted only after the staff member unlocked the door. In the middle of a Friday afternoon.  She then seemed to try to keep us next to the door stating we can see everything from there. We felt as if we were being punished for inquiring about joining.<//Text>

Anytime Fitness, a great place to get in shape.  Equipment is new, clean and it's not very crowded ever.  It's open all the time, literally, 24/7 even holidays. All members can get access to the Anytime Fitness clubs worldwide, 2500 and growing which offer personal showers, classes and even tanning.< /text>

I've been to many AFs' and this one is hands down the most cleanly and where I feel the safest. If you have any problems with fellow members or the environment the manager, Michele, takes every step to make sure you feel at home and takes care of the problem. The best thing is that it's a tight run ship which means I don't have to worry about equipment laying around everywhere, if I need something it is always in its place,  the bathrooms are sanitary so I feel comfortable changing there after work and people aren't hogging up machines or weights because they are on their phones. I feel safe knowing that you must use your key fob to get in and the guest door remains locked, the cubbies where everyone puts their belongings is close to the guest door and yes the area is safe but things still happen so I like this extra precaution. When someone comes to the door Michele walks up right away and lets them in during office hours, I really like the screening process, I'm not cool with random people just walking in and working out. I think it's comical that she has signs everywhere reminding people of the rules because there are a lot of them but it's crazy how members still do not follow any of them so the more signs the merrier. The membership is inexpensive and I've never had any problems with billing or fees, that's rare when any company uses a third party for taking the automatic monthly payments. I think this club's motto is respect, if you respect the staff and club rules you'll always be welcome.</Text>

They have a thousand ways to charge you extra money without informing you. And basically no one will listen to you after they got you on their hook, go here if you wanna pay a hundred a month to work out. Michelle, one of their employee, will literally yell at you if there's anything shes not happy about. Wow, how about some respect?< /text>

Mike Brahney is a personal trainer at this location.  I paid this sleez monthly to train my wife. I discovered after months of paying him for his service he was engaged in an affair with my wife, knowing her marital status. I realize the fault on both sides.  It is my personal opinion that he's extremely unprofessional.  He has other motives with his female clients.</text>

<response>None<//response><Text>Was visiting from out of state, so it was my first time ordering food from Thai Time Bistro. Ordered the Avocado Curry, it was very delicious. Nice big chunks of fresh Avocado, lots of red and green peppers with plenty of chicken and several shrimp.
Patrick was the fella that took my order, he was very friendly with everyone that was placing an order or there for pickup orders.
If I lived near by, I would most definitely choose to order food from Thai Time Bistro often.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Don't fall for the delicious sounding description of thai fries.  They're just fries.  With warm ranch & warm ketchup. For $9. Also got the hot basil with shrimp,  it was mostly bell pepper & onion but the spice was nice.  I guess I ordered badly,  it wasn't very good.<//Review>

Good food great atmosphere and the people who work here are very kind. This a place to go for the whole family. Being at the beach it's the only real Thai food around. Matter of fact if I was anywhere in this are I would drive to here to eat .,😆< /Text>

<text>Ordered panang curry with a $5 upcharge for seafood. There were 2 fish balls and 1 tablespoon of crab. When I called to inquire the kitchen and wife of the owner, Patrick was adamant they added at least 5 different types of seafood implying Im lying. I definitely would not stay on hold with the restaurant for 15 minutes for $5. Terrible customer service and our family will never eat here again.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

For ten years I’ve eaten here - but no more. When people said it changed and went downhill, I held out. But after today’s meal I can’t deny it anymore. Something’s gone awry, the quality has gone way down. I would recommend they either reevaluate how they cook food or that everyone goes somewhere else. It’s not the worst I’ve ever had, but no where near the best.</text>

Excellent service and great taste.
They were very tolerant with a friend of mine who was a little inopportune.
The owner even gifted him a plastic cup.
I appreciated that gesture.</Review>

The Avocado Curry and Panang Curry are delicious. Portions are large enough to split with another person. Staff is friendly and personable. Very mellow place.< /Text>

Unfortunately after changing managers I had to change a once excellent review. Thai Time Bistro in Ocean Beach does not have consistency among chefs. Before the old chef took over as manager you could order any dish without fish sauce. Now you can only get those dishes without fish sauce when she is there. So vegan options are very limited. They also don't tell you there is fish sauce in things when you order a vegetarian option. You must inquire each visit, and ask if you can get it without the fish sauce. The manager told me any of the chefs can prepare the dish without fish sauce. But I have been told repeatedly by other wait staff that getting items without fish sauce is not an option for the chef that is cooking. I have spoken to them multiple times telling them cohesion is really important. But they basically told me that they are not catering to vegetarians or vegans. So I figured a shout out was important. I won't be eating there anymore. Unfortunately there isn't another Thai place in walking distance :(< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I visited San Diego and lived in ocean beach three years ago. I had deep impression about the boba smoothies these store provide. It was such a good memory. However, when I visited today, the food and service is terrible. I waited for about an hour to get my food and waiter and waitress just don’t care you at all. Alright, I will just keep the good memory and never eat here again!</Review>< Pictures>

Food is great! But service is honestly the worst I have ever experienced. The girl is rude and every time I go she does not help or make any eye contact. We stood by the please wait to be seated sign for 15 min, and ended up seating ourselves. And was rude taking out order. The boy who eventually did everything else was much better. I hope he gets our very little tip that was left. This was the same situation every time we have gone there.< /text>

The spoons were crusted with dirt and the tops had dried crud on the inside of them. We let the server know, but she chose to do nothing about that. Will never be back with a place that's dirty. They only get two stars because the food was good but could have gotten a lot more stars had the Place been cleaner</Text>< pics>

I'm really sad that it's not the same owners anymore. The food here used to be great! I'm visiting from LA and this used to be my spot for Thai food. Now, it's really mediocre and no one Thai seems to work in the kitchen. Don't get me wrong, the staff was really nice, but it's unfortunate that the food quality is not the same anymore. Every dish we ordered was missing key Thai ingredients, which made it taste bland and unauthentic. I think they should hire real Thai chefs to help the current chefs or change the restaurant to something their current chefs are best at making.</Review>

<text>I don't think this place is even open anymore and if it is why??? Have tried to go there several times and it was either closed or "cash only" the which they didn't tell me over the phone when I ordered. They had always taken card in the past. The soup I ordered didn't even fill the container. Just bad overall experience which is good bad because I used to love going in there back when they had their stuff together.< /text>< pics>

As like everyone else, this was the spot for me and ALL the out of state visitor's I would bring in regularly.
Everyone loved this place.
Now the food sucks, not hot, 50 min. wait time for food, 30 min. wait time for drinks.
I am so bummed,this place went downhill instantly.
The girl that waited on my party was rude, and had no want or desire to be dealing with customers.
She was so inconvenienced when we asked for bowls after ordering soup........
Silverware is also apparently something she huffs at when asked for as well.
I will no longer be spending money here.
Sad situation. Do yourself a favor and heed my warning. This place is very, very disappointing now.</Text>

<Text>Used to be my Favorite Thai spot. They are under new management and the service is now horrrrrrrible. There is not even anyone Thai working here any longer. I would stay away from this place. They will charge you for food you didn't order. Menu prices are wrong and it's your fault. I used to go to this place twice sometimes three times a week and I gave the new management ample chances. I hope they get their act together so I can edit this review and put them back at 5 stars.</Text>< date>

We are spoiled coming from an area with plentiful Thai and Asian food so we were not expecting anything great, but each dish exceeded our expectations! We had pad Thai, orange chicken, basil mussels, curry, and drinks. Really hit the spot, and service was excellent.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Was shocked when my bill came. I was charged $6 for 2 cans of coke and $1.50 for more white steamed rice. Food was to die for. But wont go back due to too many hidden costs. $10 of my bill was added but never discussed.</review>

This place is good, we sometimes stop by for lunch. Our usual orders are the Panang curry , the pad thai, and the beef noodles. For lunch they have combos with an entree, a soup & salad, and an egg roll for $12 or up to $16 depending on the meat you order with it.

Update 4/20/18

Owners have changed, food took too long to bring out (some of our party got their food 45 min after us) and the recipes are different as well. Got my usual Pad Thai and there was just no flavor. Can't recommend anymore.</review>

Nice ambiance for a strip mall, though you're in OB so it's better already. Their food and service are 4 stars caliber and their recent addition of a handful of good draft beers at a fabulous price earns an extra star!< /Review>

The good: I used GrubHub  to order, and my order arrived 15 minutes before expected. Food was a perfect temperature to dive right in.
The okay: The crab angel appetizers were just slightly overcooked,  a bit too brown at the edges. And with a subtle but odd salty taste.
The not so good: I noted on order that I wanted MILD, not spicy. My panang curry is definitely spicy, probably moderately spiced for some, but too spicy for me.  I also asked that the driver call when he arrived, so I was startled when there was a knock and no call.
I have eaten at all the Thai Time restaurants in San Diego,  always enjoy the food. But they went just a little off mark with this online order.</Text>

<text>I would highly recommend coming here for a great massage.  I came in very tense from a long week at work and standing most of my day. I left here feeling so much better! It’s very clean, beautiful environment, nice spa sounds and very professional.
My therapist was Shin, she listened to my concerns and addressed them. Everyone was so nice and cared if I was happy with my treatment. I will be back for sure!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Favorite spot in the area. No bs. Always consistent and they actually know what they do. You will get massaged, walked on, bent and stretch. You will leave feeling amazing.<//review>

Hour massage becomes 50 minutes.  Not at this  place. Jamie actually went a few minutes over the time. 90 minute massage was perfect to start the weekend.  Thank you Jamie!</Text>< Pictures>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>By the end of last week, I was experiencing stiffness and spasms in my neck and could not turn my head without severe pain. On Saturday morning, the pain was worse. I found this place with a Google search. Most massage places in the area were closed due to Covid 19. Panwa returned my voice mail promptly and gave me an appointment within 45 minutes. They took my temperature , had me sign a Coronavirus waiver and I paid cash before the massage. Preliminaries over, they took me straight back to a dimly lit private room with quiet music and gave me privacy to disrobe. The environment is soothing. The massage practitioner did not focus solely on my neck, but also worked on my entire back, both arms, my shoulders and even worked a bit on my legs and feet. She walked up the back of my legs and up to my shoulder blades. In between working on other areas of my body, she returned repeatedly to my neck and shoulders. Since the area was extremely painful, this gave me breaks to relax between bouts of intensive deep tissue massage. She was very thorough. Without me telling her, she located several other areas on my body where I have ongoing issues and focused on them. Overall, this was a positive experience and I would highly recommend them.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Had a massage at this location. The massage was great, actually amazing! That was the three stars. Now for the downside of this establishment. The place is filthy, the couches seem like they were picked up on the side of the road and they covered them with sheets. Really!! The tables that the massage was on was VERY hard and very uncomfortable and I’m pretty sure the blanket that was on the table was there from the previous customer.
Honestly, I would love to come back for another massage but I’m not sure it’s worth the risk of catching something funky.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Great authentic Thai massage, and excellent customer service. I will be back!
This review is based on two massages.
I had this massage 2 months after giving birth to my child, and I hadn't had a true massage in over a year, so needless to say I was way overdue and in need of a good massage. It may have been harder than my body could handle though because I was sore and uncomfortable that night (more than normally expected after a massage). But I contacted the owner the next day and explained my experience; she asked me to return and I am so glad I did - the re-do massage by Anne was MUCH better, lighter pressure and more relaxing. I'm so thankful for their excellent customer service in addressing my pain. I am now a loyal customer.

Tip: this is not a typical relaxing massage like the Swedish or deep-tissue massages found at most other places. It can be quite strong so make sure you ask for medium or soft pressure, especially if it's your first time. And prepare to be stretched and twisted like a pretzel. But highly recommended!

Tip: they accept cash only</text><GmapID>0x80dd26e989ea4f27:0x3d69f232b6baffc4</GmapID><time>1475674441222< /time>< Name>

I came to panwa for a Thai massage after my friend recommended it. On Tuesdays and Thursdays massages are $10 off so they only charge $40 for an hour or 60 for 90 minutes.  My friend recommended Jamie, who did a great job especially because I'm a big guy with a lot of tension in my shoulders. They do the traditional Thai massage where they walk on your back and workout the deeper knots, but then they also do a Swedish Style massage with oil. The grand finale is the traditional Thai method, where they stretch and bend you like yoga. Then they serve you bottled water or hot tea complimentary.</Text>

I ran my first marathon yesterday and wanted to get a massage.  Seen the reviews on this place and wanted to give this place a try.  This place was great!!!  I told her where I was sore and she worked out all the knots, my muscles weren't sore anymore, and I left there feeling fabulous.  It was a a highlight of my vacation.< /Review>

Went there a few years ago and returned ( I live out of state) to find out they still perform a very nice, traditional Thai massage, which is why I went there twice, even though I would only be in the area for a week. Excellent skills, I highly recommend...........< /Text>

The upstairs gallery featured the exhibition "Alchemical Love" by pascALEjandro. There was a soundtrack accompaniment to these paintings which made me quite emotional and added an extra dimension to the experience.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt886-vTytTeLAo6AtbmVB3dtKi7l3EDo7p0mc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<time>1531409712676</time><rating>5<//rating><review>Always worth the drive to Culver City!  Within walking distance there are about 13 galleries here, and I start at Plum and Poe because I know it will be powerful.

There is a upstairs and downstairs.  Downstairs there is one huge room, with high open ceilings and concrete floors.  The space is great.  As you turn the corner there's a smaller area.

You can take the stairs or elevator.  Upstairs there is office space,  and gallery space. This is more intimate,  but still quite large.

There is a gift shop downstairs. There is a help desk where I have always found the person there to be friendly, knowledgeable and approachable.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Drove here to check out Nara's work. Decent size gallery with 3-4 rooms?
Free gallery.

Parking:
They have free parking in the back when you enter the small street. If it's full then there's street parking.<//Text>

Was a walk in with an idea of what I wanted and they worked with me to finalize the design. Then we went back to a great open space and sat down with the artist (Donny) and he talked with us while we placed the stencil. After final checks we were off! The whole thing was quick and the shop was very clean. I would highly recommend them if you want a tattoo l. Got my first one and it was a great experience< /Review>

<review>I love my half sleeve tattoo. Mike Erwin is an incredible artist. Everyone who works there is very qualified and they're friendly and kind. I've often experienced rude and nasty people at tattoo palour check in - not the case here! Super professional.<//review><time>1607418779226<//time>< pictures>

Of the ten tattoos I have I can confidently say that this one is the cleanest and has the most impeccable detail. The shop is beautiful and the artist have a wonderful stack of books of their art. It’s pricey but so worth it!< /Text>

We came to California for a holiday all the way from Boston, and our trip inspired us to get a tattoo. We met with Donny Newman and he was such a great professional to work with. He took our idea and made it into something special and memorable. The whole experience was just so easy, specially since we hadn't planned this. He did a wonderful job and it's a memory which will be forever with us in the form of a brilliant tattoo. Love love love them! Absolutely recommend!</review>

<review>Amazing studio, very talented artists, relaxed. Got tattooed by Jeff Croci while I was on holiday in San Francisco. I was so lucky to get an appointment during my short stay there. All the planning was done via email beforehand and the shop manager Virgil as well as Jeff took their time with me and answered all my questions patiently.
The design of my tattoo as well as the execution surpassed my expectations by far. Jeff sketched the design directly on my skin and I couldn't be happier with it. Thank you for a great experience and a very beautiful tattoo!<//review>< pictures>

One of the best shops in the bay when it comes to artistic ability/talent and customer service. I've done a couple of 3 hour sessions with Henry and I'm really looking forward to finishing up my shoulder/half sleeve. Pricing is fair for the amazing quality and the front desk call, text, email and work with you to schedule your sessions.</review>

Zach was an incredibly fast tattoo artist. He did a moth tattoo for my wife in about 45 minutes in black/grey in about 45 mins. It looks incredible!

<text>I've been contemplating when to get this piercing and I finally decided to get it although I was frightened of the pain. Alex was so friendly and calming. He walked me through the whole process. I was scared for nothing, it was the
least painful thing and I'm so happy!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This place does great work and their staff is very friendly and professional. I got a small tattoo done here (first tattoo ever) and the whole experience was superb. My tattoo came out great and was painless. I hear that once you get one tattoo you want to get more; and when I want to get my second and third and fourth tattoo I would definitely come here.< /Review>

<text>Made an appt for a consult, which apparently no one wrote down, so the only person available was a guest artist who was only available for the next two days, then when I explained my timing was very limited due to work (there are 1-2 days each month I am available. I have no issue scheduling further out because of availability) I was told to maybe try calling a week before one of those days to see if I could be scheduled. Haphazard and unacceptable for a professional business.< /text><gmap_id>0x808580824392d02d:0x6a853f8fbef377b2</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Went here to get a best friends tattoo with some mates and the staff is very friendly. They do some great work too. The tattoo I got was pretty basic and simple but I want to come back here for something bigger and more detail.

If you're visiting or a local, this is a well known shop with great artists.<//text>

<review>This shop is world class, there's no place better in the Bay Area or anywhere. Jeff Croci is a phenomenal artist and I'm lucky to have his work. Take the time to make an appointment because it's worth the wait. Tattoos are forever, don't compromise.<//review>< userid>

<text>Tucked in an alley around the corner from Brainwash in SoMa, you'll find an industrial, open and artsy space that's home to Seventh Son, one of the best places to get inked. I scheduled a pre/design meeting with Greg, and it went fairly quick. We exchanged one email with my design ideas and two weeks later I found myself on the table getting a delicate design inked on my right forearm. Greg is renowned for his fine needlework and many people including myself remark how precise and difficult his "penmanship"  is to replicate. He nailed my tattoo in less than 60 min with some shading and color.< /text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The service was terrible with Jeff Croci! First, my tattoo was very small and the minimum price was $100. But after that, Jeff was rude when I asked to increase a bit the drawing: "NO CHANGE". And when I changed the place to tattoo, he asked me if I was doing it to waste his time on purpose.< /Review>

<Review>The management team is a joke, especially the manager. That old lady is rude and condescending. Instead of helping tenants with their issues, she is only good at evading. The management team constantly gives out self-conflicting messages. On the first day, they say YES to you, and it quickly becomes a NO the next day. Ridiculous. zhen de sb<//Review></record>

<Review>i rent the apt for 10 months and the office deducted my deposit for over 3000 bucks without any words, only after I asked them the reason, they said the oven and refrigerator were broke. They didn’t response our request to provide evidence. Just before we move out, the oven and refrigerator were working well and we hired a cleaning lady to clean the apartment. If they are really broke, we are willing to pay for it if we could see the bill and evidence!

DO NOT rent Cypress point!! The office never response, deduct as many deposit as they want!!!<//Review><rate>1< /rate>< pictures>

The office manager of this complex is over the top rude!  She did not even want to listen to what I was trying to ask her and just went off on me like no other. She yelled at me in front of a construction worker and waved me off with her hand like "just go away!"  I have never been treated so badly in my life.   She needs help and shouldn't be in a position where she deals with customers in any way shape or form.  A bad representative of Cypress Point apartments.  I told her I was going to report her to her manager and she waved me off again saying " go ahead, tell my manager"!< /text>

Do not rent from here
First impressions are skewed,  they're a predatory Apartment Complex. They'll reel you in with good service and timely responses, but the second your lease is up they'll treat you like trash. It's easy to get in but hard to get out. I've been reaching out to them for almost 3 months and have yet to receive my security deposit or even a receipt of what it was used on. The fact that they can't handle a simple procedure shows how incompetent they are with basic management. The reviews and stars speak for themselves. I'll change my review if I can get an answer on my security deposit, but as of now this place is an utter joke.< /review>

DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT RENTING AN APARTMENT HERE!!!!!  I had an extremely negative experience from beginning to end.  First of all, Elaine is extremely condescending, rude, and takes advantage of first time and young renters.  Upon move-in, it was clear that the apartment had serious mold and trapped moisture issues.  Elaine rushed through our move-in inspection, probably hoping that we would overlook some issues.  The carpet was soaking wet because they had kept the windows closed after it had been cleaned.  When we brought the issue to the attention of management, Elaine gave us a box of carpet fresh with only about 1/4 of the container left to "get rid of the smell."  I was far more concerned about getting sick from the obvious mold.  When we moved in, Elaine also made a point to say that the apartment had been "professionally" painted, but it was obvious that this was not the case as there were paint drips all over the floor in the bathroom and kitchen.  In the winter, mold developed around the window in the bedroom and the sliding glass door in the living room.  When we asked maintenance about it, they said it was just something we had to keep under control with bleach.  Maybe if they had installed double-paned windows or updated the aging apartments in any way, it wouldn't be so much of an issue.  The carpets were always damp in the winter, and nothing ever dried out in this apartment, especially towels in the bathroom or dishes in the kitchen.  Depending on where your apartment is located, you will either be boiling hot and in direct sun or (in our case) never see the true light of day.  The kitchen and bathroom were always dark, no matter what time of day it was.  The shower never kept the same temperature for more than 30 seconds at a time, and the toilet clogged extremely easily.  We consistently had to unclog our toilet once or twice a day.  If you try to adhere anything to the wall, huge paint chunks will come off when removing these items because they slap a new coat of paint on every time someone moves out.  They increased the price of laundry in the middle of the pandemic when people were doing their worst financially.  They recently were taken over by a new leasing company and seem to have replaced the entire leasing office staff - thank god.  The bar set by the previous management was so low that I was pleased to learn the new staff was actually conscientious and pleasant when I interacted with them.  But at least the old management picked up the phone when I called the office!  It has been such a nightmare trying to move out of this place.  I had to schedule a move-out inspection for three separate dates because they "lost" the paperwork for the first two.  When it came time for the third attempt at an inspection, I called to make sure they hadn't forgotten, and they had once again!  I was able to schedule one for two days after this third date, which happened to be a Sunday.  It was scheduled for 10AM and I was told to arrive at the office at 9:45.  They neglected to understand their own operating hours because they don't open until 11AM on Sundays.  At this point I had already moved into a new place, so they wasted an hour of my Sunday morning.  When I came back to the office at 11AM, I was told that they didn't have any maintenance staff onsite and that they don't do inspections on Sundays.
Then why did they schedule my inspection for a Sunday in the first place?!  Since my lease was up the next day, I turned in my keys and was told that an inspection would happen that week.  It's been nearly two months since my lease ended and they still haven't returned my security deposit.  I'm not even sure that an inspection ever happened, as I haven't received an itemized list of repairs either.  I even gave them my forwarding address.  I call them about once a week to check in, and they almost never return my calls.  I've been more than lenient and beyond flexible with their both legal obligation and treatment of me and am having to take legal action just to get what is owed to me.<//Review>

<review>The process to move out is a nightmare. Beware that the staff in the office will ignore 90% of calls incoming and will not return any missed ones. Their lease looks like a fixed end date and they will speak as if it is when you first sign, but will automatically switch to a month to month lease without any acknowledgement needed from tenants if the 30 day notice is anything but written. Don't expect any help from them for how to issue the notice properly, as they won't answer any calls. Their office has become rude and condescending since I went upset I was paying thousands more than I originally thought I would. College students beware, the lease and office is set up to scam first time renters.< /review>< resp>

UPDATE: After we moved out they took a large chunk of our deposit without any reason to. Still not a bad place, but definitely not 5 start material. The deposit is cheap but be ready to lose a fair amount of it when you move out.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: We have only lived at the Cypress Point apartments for 3-ish months now but it has been such a great experience to this point. We are students and were looking for a nice place to live that was close to downtown and public transportation up to campus, and Cypress Point checks both of those boxes and then some. We were going through the process of finishing up paperwork and moving in very close to the end of the school year and so we were all very busy and distracted. Despite all this the Cypress Point staff was very patient with us throughout the move in process which we greatly appreciated. Elaine in particular has been extremely helpful with helping us get settled in. We were having a number of issues with things like our renter's insurance and Elaine was unbelievably helpful and patient while we figured it out. We are very thankful for the Cypress Point management staff and all of their patience and guidance.

We said patience a lot, but really they have been exceptionally patient with us and for that we are grateful.

Best,
Boys by the pool</review>

Hello my name is Kyle horsley, I’ve been living at cypress point apartment for about a year now. I half to say in all the apartments I have stayed in, Elaine and the lady’s in the office have been so helpful and comforting in my stay here. I can go to Elaine with any problems and she is so understanding and does anything within her power to make it happen! The apartments are nice and clean the whole complex stays clean, and one of the cheapest, nicest laundromat in the whole of Santa Cruz ! Like I said Elaine and the lady’s at cypress point apartments are unmatched hands down the nicest and easiest to work with in all my apartment experiences. I highly suggest staying, and it’s super close to downtown, the bus station, and beach. Overall amazing people here, and amazing place to stay!!<//review>

This place is terrible. Worst management EVER! Save yourself a migraine and pass on these people they don't deserve anyone's money. And notice how all the good reviews here look like they were written by cypress.
my roommates signed a contract to each pay 33.33% of rent each and one month they charged two of us 50% rent, when we called to get our money back they refused and told us they only charged the third roommate $28 and we can get the money from him. They are very unprofessional DO NOT RENT HERE!  If zero stars were possible they would get that<//text>

Would not recommend this place for students or really any person in general unless you’re desperate. There is hardly any parking available, and if you park on the street your car would likely be broken into. Guest parking is abysmal. What really makes this place the worst is the management. The management is atrocious. ELAINE is consistently incompetent and rude. She once wrongfully sent out multiple eviction notices because of an internal error, and then didn’t follow up with any of the residences to take credit for her mistake, which led multiple parties to believe that they were being suddenly evicted. Not to mention she is incredibly rude and condescending to students and young people, she will try and take advantage of you and manipulate you because you’re young. If you call to ask for clarification or information, ELAINE will try and get out of it any way that she can. The other management just sits around in the office or doing nothing.<//review>< Pictures>

I am writing this during the covid-19 epidemic and when my roommate couldn't pay his share of rent they just charged myself and my other roommate for his share. This is not normal. The apartments smell like paint and mold because before we moved in they painted over everything and there isn't very good ventilation. When we tried to opt out of renewing our lease they kept sending us the wrong form so we couldn't leave on the day our old lease ran out. The quality of the living space and the hassle of dealing with the incompetent management is not worth the money.

IF WANT TO LIVE IN A PIGSTY YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT PLACE! It is very sad to have to wish for your lease to end soon so you can get out of there! I have nothing else to say but horrible things about this place. Management is a joke. Fiorina the General Manager and Elaine the leasing agent. Be careful, they will be very nice to you until they get your money, then be ready for them to turn into witches. They are so unprofessional, rude, and have no consideration. Pay attention to these reviews, they are true and correct. I ignored them and had nothing but a nightmare since I moved in. Problem #1 out 100, I was placed in an apartment which was not what I was promised. I was expecting a lagoon view and instead, I was given an apartment above a PIG, there is no other way to describe this person, the apartment smelled like urine, I was told it was the chemicals they used to clean. the person below did nothing but play loud music, get stoned and drunk in his patio. He had 2 big dogs in his apartment which he did not take out, most of the time he was too drunk, he passed out and the poor dogs had to urinate and defecate in the apartment. So, there was the answer to the smell the came right into my apartment. After a week of several complaints and a visit to the health department, they finally moved me to another apartment. The carpet was disgusting, the apartment was smelly, stove refrigerator and sink were old. Since I had nowhere to go I had no choice but to accept my sad reality. 2 weeks later the parking became another challenge, people do not respect your space so I had to call the police since I was threatened by the neighbor after confronting her because she was using my space. A week later my car was broken into, I had an extra key to my apartment in my vehicle and the key was stolen too; I had to change the lock on my apartment door. I filed a police report and advised the management about this, they just looked the other way, they never sent a maintenance person to replace the lock, I did not feel secure so I had to pay for someone to replace the lock. I always pay my rent onetime, when I moved out the apartment about 2 months ago, the apartment was cleaner than when it was given to me, as of today I do not see MY DEPOSIT. I have left several voice messages and sent emails and there is no answer. Why am I not surprised? I guess I have no other option but to report this to the BBB and take them to small claims. I know Santa Cruz has limited housing and that is why slumlords like Cypress Point take advantage of honest hardworking people. There should be more regulations to prevent landlord abuse. My advice is, run, run, run and if you have another option, I am sure it will 1000 times better than this dump!<//text>

Lots of bad reviews on here, I dunno why. I lived at Cypress Point for 15 months without incident. My only complaint is that they landscape too much, running gas powered mowers and leaf blowers and weed whackers seemingly every day. Other than that, the staff are friendly, the location is amazing, and the apartments themselves are quite cozy. Honestly, before you turn away because of the bad reviews, take a tour and see for yourself. I think you'll find that the reviews don't match the reality.< /Text>

I lived at Cypress Point for six years, moving out last month. Over that time there were a series of managers and management companies. It seemed expensive, but comparable in price and amenities to other two-bedroom  rentals in Santa Cruz that allowed pets.

Past issues, especially in the first year or so, included old, worn appliances and cabinets with covered with layers of paint; blinds and vinyl flooring that was so evenly dingy that I hadn't realized they weren't supposed to be that color; laundry rooms that always had at least one "broken" washer; announced and unannounced water shutoffs sometimes on a weekly basis; water leakage from the upstairs plumbing into my walls; and the danged notes (sometimes water shutoff warnings) taped to my front door which tore the paint off in strips. Naturally, the rent increased by 3% every year.

The positives:
The laundry and plumbing problems have been fixed. The cost per load has increased a bit, but the machines work well. Note: there are three laundry rooms for this large apartment complex, so be prepared to schlep things a ways and compete with others for time at the machines.
The gym has been upgraded and now has more equipment (but no restroom).
The pool area is nicer than it was.
Some of the apartments are currently being renovated and I've seen cabinetry and wall-to-wall carpets going into dumpsters (yay!)... I hope they're doing my old place now.
When I left, landscaping over/under-watering issues were being gradually addressed, so the grounds look much nicer, but you might watch out for one or two lawn areas that are chronically overwatered and so are slippery.
The maintenance crew is responsive about repair requests. And they're nice guys.
The dumpster areas are kept cleaner, discouraging the raccoons and crows.
The current employees are professional and friendly. I enjoyed my chats with Elaine, who was usually the one who helped me out with laundry card refills.
Florina, the manager, was always friendly with me.

There was always a cookie jar in the office for my dogs, and they knew it.

The 3 stars are for the overall, six-year experience.< /Text>

I wish I could give 0 stars .. I have been waiting for 3 months to get my deposit back. They just keep telling me, on the very rare occasions they respond to my emails and calls, that can’t tell if it’s been processed. I will have to go to small claims court to get my deposit back.</Text>

To begin if I could give this complex a zero out of five I would. This complex has a poor management staff. We have been mistreated since our move in. We had four different vacate dates, yet still got charged a pro-rated rent for our last month that did not make sense. Cypress point will charge you for the most ridiculous things throughout your stay there and then give you basically none of your deposit back. I do not suggest this place to anyone especially young college students who they think they can take advantage of. Please avoid this place at all costs!

Also, there is a MAJOR cockroach problem and managament will reluctantly help you with it! I had to call and go into the office multiple times before someone came and sprayed my apartment and then the cockroaches still did not go away! They FINALLY allowed us to have traps so the problem could be solved! By the way, we were very clean and the cockroaches came out of the OUTLETS from the wall!!!!< /Text>

How long does it take to get your deposit back? It's been over 30 days since I moved out and corporate says the manager has to make the request but Elaine the leasing  agent won't let me speak to her? Update:  40 days total.<//Text>

Well, I moved out of Cypress Point Apartments over a year ago now, so I guess I am not the best possible review one could leave.  It's expensive, but hey, it was a place to live!  Management actually let us off the hook for a lot when we were there.  It was our first time renting and when we made mistakes Elaine came directly to our door and spoke politely with us about it every time.  She was always very sweet.  We didn't have a mold problem or roaches or ants or really any sort of big issue,  but we also had moved into a unit that had just been refurbished, so perhaps that's why.  When it came time for our deposit to be returned, we got a sizable portion back, even after spilling wine on the carpet no fewer than 4 times.

It's not a dream home,  but if you're looking for a place for the school year, or even just to live in while you explore your options in life, I think Cypress is a fine place.  As long as Elaine is still there.<//text>

<Text>DO NOT LIVE HERE! It is moldy, loud, the management is rude and does not care about harassing neighbors! They do nothing.
Now after I have moved out, they keep lying to me about mailing my security deposit refund. I still haven’t received it. This entire experience has been the worst I could have imagined.< /Text>< pics>

Very rude staff. The management office will give you stress throughout the entire year. Great area, but the front office staff did not make it worth. Go someone else, they will try to rip you off as much as possible. Little or big issues, it will add up and make it very unpleasant to live there.<//Review>

Looking forward to the day rent controls squeezes the pigs of this operation.

Update: the pool is finished

Nothing like having your rent go up as a pool remains unfinished, the Internet cafe Internet is spotty at best, and the water shut offs from time to time. It’s a real treat paying more for less. Also could those prop 65 warnings posted throughout the complex be relative to the popcorn ceilings? Mmmm... asbestos in my living space. They also like watering their sidewalks with broken sprinklers still.

Also, 10 visitor parking spots because anyone who goes here must not have a social life, apparently.  Those are also not guaranteed as when Cypress Point does major remodeling they will shut those spots down in order to park gardening tools and potted plants: all of which I had no idea were cars. My eyes fooled me yet again.

Also the Internet cafe used to have a bathroom for all until their land management decided to install a key lock and limit it to their lazy employees. A real shame as people have to walk back home and leave their valuables in the cafe while going back to do their business; hopefully no one will urinate themselves in the cafe.

Oh, and if your dedicated one space of parking (no matter how many room/s they rip you off for- only one per unit) gets taken by someone else, enjoy having to call a security guard who will take an upwards of 1.5 hours just to be a middle man that then calls the tow truck which will take another hour to hour and a half while you wait helplessly with your car as surface streets are permit parking. Better hope it takes under two hours.

It’s a grand experience- almost as if they take our rent money and use it to fund their slushee/hit dog parties and Nose’a’chinos, because where the hell else does my rent money go?

My favorite part: lease renewals are now down to 11 month minimums. They used to have 18 months available.

Cypress Point is the epitome of why we needed Measure M. Sorry homeowners, but step in our shoes and see what corporate slumlord means to renters who just want to have a dog/cat-child or simply get by.

You could say it is staffed here with gingers because there is no soul. Except for the cats and fellow poor souls who may end up here with no other pet friendly option, or simply option in a housing crisis city. There is this one named Luna and I call him Elainecat because I wish he was the office manager. And he’s in the yard when the real one is away. I almost want to change this one star to two for the cool cats that live here.< /Text>

I was not able to attend the initial viewing so it was a huge shock to find out that the back bedroom was pungent with cat urine/spray. Initially management offered me pet enzyme spray cleaner which had no effect on the smell. It was only after I wrote a sternly worded formal grievance to the manager and owners, citing health and safety civil codes re: occupancy and livability, that the carpet was replaced with heavy cut to fit berber carpet , presumably costly. The wood support floor was not cleaned and was so badly soaked the scent remained pungent from outside the room. The unit was not painted, cleaned or even vacuumed/swept upon move in. All walls had huge swaths of hastily applied and mismatched paint (impo as an (art historian/curator) yet I was charged more than $800 for  repainting.

The materials used for constructing the units are very cheap. The walls are incredibly thin. If you have nice neighbors you're fine. Otherwise it is a very noisy complex. Generally it's an ok place to live, especially near the creek or lagoon side.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Absolutely horrible management, no matter how much you try to contact them and resolve something, it will go unanswered and if you are lucky enough to get an answer it will go unsolved. Anytime management called, it was to my girlfriend because they knew they could be more rude to her, the second I took the phone and said it was me, they instantly became peachy. Cockroach issues were never resolved, I was told the place had a bunch of asbestos in the walls and ceiling AFTER we moved in so I should not puncture walls/ceilings. Fungus and mold is a major issue, the bathroom had poor ventilation and no matter how hard I scrubbed away the black fungus/mold that grew on my shower and shower curtains, it would be back the next week!  Rent is way too ridiculously high for such a slum. maintenance manager lied and told me not to cover up a couple of poorly painted and peeling spots when we arrived because "it was not taken from our deposit" well it was anyways. College students stay away, they will suck you dry just because they think your parents will pay. Location was the only good thing about the place by being so close to downtown but other than that it was awful.</text>

I lived there for almost a year...there is such a large mold problem there from neglected repairs that the entire place had mold growth, and so did all my stuff inside in only about five months of living there!  Both me and my dog became ill with fungal infections, skin soars, and other health problems continue to ail me and its been 5 years!  The staff were rude and acted as if they had no idea of the mold, but had a dehumidifier  on hand to put in my apartment immediately!  Cypress point apartments should be red tagged!  They may seem okay at first, but move in, and you will see...I had an inspector come and evaluate the place...the inside spore count was over 3000 and out door was 300...that number should be almost the same or a problem is there!  I lost everything...even the clothes on my back!  Do not even consider living in this place unless you want to get very ill, and loose everything you own!  I was so traumatized that i was unable to sue them, or I would of!  I have dr's that said i had fungus, and my dogs vet said that...a mold evaluation...and over 1000 photos of mold on everything in that place!  Do not let them lie about it...it is the worst place in santa cruz to live!  The homeless shelter is cleaner than this place!!!  Do your self a favor and do not rent from this horrible place!  I got very ill due to the mold and hope that no one else ever has to go threw what I have been threw because of this place's mold problem!< /Review></record>

I wish I could give them a zero star rating. Or i wish these stars had negative numbers. The reason why I hate cypress point apartments booking agents/managers is because I was well along the application process because Sam, one of the booking agents misinformed me and the girl i was going to live with. While we were well along the application process, he told me that me and my roomie couldnt move in till late January, even though he told me beforehand that we could move in on January 3. They he told my roomie that the apartment was not even on the market. Because of this misinformation, me and my roomie had to pick another apartment, and that was difficult because we had to keep calling each other and negotiation. I had to cancel my application because Sam was so terrible and sketchy. SO pretty much, I am homeless because Sam misinformed me and my roomate. If he had not LIED to us, the application process would have went smoothly. NEVER TRY TO RENT WITH CYPRESS POINT.</review>

Great store very large selection of products lots of fresh fruit and vegetables organic and non .friendly staff members and cashiers. Just like any store some good deals some great deals scored me a big chocolate pudding cake for 4 bucks that's a good deal. Easy to see from the street many other businesses in the same vicinity. Definitely plan on visiting more often
PS I only went in for a gallon of milk. Ended up buying cherries apples cake and ice cream😎<//Text>

<review>This store was so poorly staffed today. A single lane was open, but the checker was changing so nobody was being checked out. A new line opened and then Barbara then abandoned the lane to get booze for someone. Corey finally opened a third lan , but he also immediately stepped away. So poorly run. I really regret my choice to do business here. BTW, I wrote this review from the line.< /review>< Resp>

I love the quality of the items in the store. One of the best deals is their coffees from all over the world. You can get any amount you want and all coffees are the same price.  You can get large or small quantities of their items and you're in and out of the store in no time.<//text>

I shop regularly at Smart and Final. This location is clean and attractive and has some unique products, but I shop for a restaurant and there usually isn't enough of the items I need. It is set up more for personal shopping than for commercial needs.</Text>

Hard to find what you're looking for, but staff was very helpful showing where everything is. Friendly and and has a local feel even though it's "big box" sales.<//review>

<text>My family and I love this store. The prices are great and you can get everything you need there. Not as fancy as some of the more expensive stores but if you are buying for a large group its great. It's somewhere between costco and your regular market.<//text><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

The checkers used to be so nice here, now they are ridiculous and will close their lane when short staffed and after another checker has sent you over to them. Need some management stepping in on customer service.</Text>

This is the worst place ever, my grandma got transferred here after her time in the ER was over. She had made lots of progress and was showing incredible signs. She was doing very good but was very neglected by staff and faculty. Another thing is that they never made sure she had her oxygen on, which she needed. if your loved one is going here for the intense care unit PLEASE DO NOT SEND THEM HERE! This is the worst place ever and they did not continue checking up on my grandma, knowing she would take her oxygen off. This staff does not care for your loved ones health, they show no remorse or kindness to patients what so ever. My grandmother recently passed away because of the neglect she was facing at this rehab. So please if you care for your loved ones; DONT SEND THEM HERE.<//Text>

My father is in for the last two weeks and is doing great after surgery. The only issue is his walking. Before the surgery he was able to walk around his home, slowly. It was enough to take care of himself. He’s in rehab just to get him walking again, since he hasn’t walked for several weeks. He claims that nobody has been to his room for getting him up and walking around the couple weeks he been in. With no visitors without an appointment it’s hard to verify this, but my father’s memory is very good yet, and when I ask the staff they say they are, my father says differently. Someone is lying.</review>

<Text>This place just took my grandfather last week and he went in he was just a little weak but the doctors didn't find any major issues other than him not doing enough excerise and eating properly. Within a matter of a couple days he had a terrible staff infection and he was throwing up blood. This place nearly killed my grandfather and to make matters worse they will not let you in half the time, they LOST his personal belongings, and even the doctor at the hospital said that they see this exact issue from this rehab facility all the time!!! They go in fine and they come out near dying!!! This place must be shut down before their negligence gets more people killed!! Makes me sick!<//Text><user>116970200694442731954< /user></record>

This place was a such a bad experience. We had my father here to recover but all they did was neglect him. He got horrible bed soars from how little they acctualy moved him positions and from how little they cleaned him. The doctor never updated you with peogress or with lab test results. The physical theipy personel would do the minimum and just be talking the whole time amongs themselfs. We had them send my father to the hospital becuse they neglected to do anything about a mass growing in his stomach. Neddless to say it was a serious situation and if we didnt get him to the icu quickly things could have taken a turn for the worse. Seams like all they did here was add more pain.</Text>

My mother in law was sent here because she tested positive for COVID. Thankfully she survived with only a moderate case. Overall this place is like all the others she has been in. I would normally give 3 stars if it were not for her case manager Kim. She was so kind and was the best we have experienced anywhere. Reche Canyon, if you are reading this, she is making you look much better in my eyes and earned you a solid one star increase!!!</text>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>My cousin suffered brain damage 7+years ago and is totally bedridden. He has been To multiple locations where he has received less than average care and it was so terrifying to see the horrible things that go on at some of these care facilities. We had to move him around until we found a place that we saw was consistently and properly taking care of him and his needs, as well as ours when we inquired about his recovery. Hes now been at Reche Canyon Rehab for almost 5 years and they have done wonders with him. They go above and beyond to make sure he gets the best care possible. We’ve never noticed any signs of neglect or mistreatment from any of his caretakers or staff members at this facility unlike the previous two locations he was at prior to arriving there. Family is super important and it’s so hard to find nice safe clean place with great people to care for them when they’re in need of help. I saw all these horrible reviews so I had to speak up and share with others about how awesome this place truley is because it is so hard and really scary trying to find a good place for our loved ones. So I was really upset to read bad things about such a good place. I called today just to check in on the visitation schedule and LJ picked RIGHT AWAY and was super professional and helpful, like always. He had to place me on hold to get my question answered but came back within 60 seconds with all the information info i needed and more. Plus he always has a great attitude and was very knowledgeable. Dont let this crazy pandemic situation mess up a good place’s reputation, were all dealing with crazy times right now with the limited resources so we have to be considerate for the people who are taking care of the people who cant care for themselves. I’ve had to take care of my own Mom and it was so hard to find time and deal with her needs and crazy stubbornness and house, feed and bath her, so I understand the struggle is real.</Review>< Rate>

<rating>4</rating><review>I was a patient at this facility a few years back and after reading all the awful ratings I had to put my two cents in. My stay in this facility save my life I was in a motorcycle accident where I fractured my back the therapist that work with me his name is Joe me he got me through my first month at what turned out to be Exchange in life I was in a wheelchair for 7 months learning how to walk again it was a staff at this facility they gave me all the tools I needed to move on with my life. I think all the awful reviews come from people expecting miracles or more that can really be expected. In order to recover from an injury you have to want to be rehabilitated if you treat your therapist and staff poorly you will obviously get a poor response.< /review>< pictures>

If you care about your loved ones, do not let them go here. I would give a zero star if I could. They’re negligence led to my grandfathers passing. They do not care. They left him alone for hours on end, he ended up getting bed sores. They gave him narcotics when he wasn’t prescribed anything but Motrin. He lost a ton of weight because they weren’t feeding him. Seems like they just want their patients drugged so they don’t have to do their Job.</text>

<Text>My brother is there and has ALS, he has severely progressed since February when he got there. I can't believe they lost a computer of his that he uses daily to communicate with his wife and daughter. He has had numerous roommates pass away in the last 3 months due to negligence of not responding to alarms coming from the rooms. There all too busy having luncheons and fundraisers for there own special events. I can't wait till my bro gets out of there and his wife can bring him home. For this place has doubled the stress on her and his condition.<//Text><Rate>1< /Rate><Name>Bill Orozco<//Name></record>

<rate>1<//rate><review>My sister was sent to Reche canyon rehab after sustaining a back injury. The nurses aide put a diaper on her. She is not incontinent! She was able to use the bedpan. They were so long answering the call light that she had to use the diaper a few times and ended up with a bladder infection which they did not treat. She was discharged after 10 days. It was very rushed and the nurse and physical therapist seemed surprised and unprepared. She was sent home without discharge instructions. The doctor ordered home health, PT and OT. The case manager did nothing! She should have gotten authorization from her insurance and sent orders to a home health agency. She did Nothing.
Her primary doc took care of the infection and home health. She has been home 2 weeks in a back brace without home health or PT. They are starting tomorrow.

Reche canyon rehab is incompetent, smelly, uncaring. Don’t go there!< /review>< pics>

< Review>
Why has this facility remain opened??
I feel that this place should be investigated thoroughly by state officials. Doctors and Social Services do not respond to messages left.  Patient with anxiety & pain left for another patient only to die from heart attack that could possibly be prevented!  DO NOT SEEK CARE HERE!!</Review>

<text>This place is so poorly ran it’s unfair to the patients first off. Secondly then employees have no way to even take care of a patient.
Every RN has 20 patients a person. There is no way any patients needing real care or assistance to be cared for there is just no time for anykind of attention. If you loved is basically 100% healthy and can communicate clearly and use the restroom alone you can send them here... but if they need help or assistance PLEDE SAVE THEIR LIVES and fight for them to go to Somewhere else..this place does give enough staff to properly run.. I will give another review with details later... please fight you loved ones<//text>< gmapID>

Kaiser Permanente recommended that our mother live her last days in this facility because the doctors didn’t think she would survive living in the higher elevation where we live on hospice. Kaiser provided the “comfort care” room. This room is designed to be family friendly, allowing 24/7 access and a place for a member of the family to sleep with her overnight. The doctors are caring and compassionate. Everyone was helpful and respectful. The setting is amazing, away from the hustle and bustle of the city yet freeway close for all the family to visit.</review>

Patient care at it’s worse! The facility has no air conditioner and the level of maintenance INSIDE THE ROOMS IS HORRIBLE. This place cares more about “looks” than patient care.</Review>

My husband was recently a patient at Reche Canyon for  a little less than a month. I was able to visit him every day and witnessed the progress he made on a daily basis thanks to his effort and to the staff that helped him day after day.  He received exceptional service and care by the nursing and physical therapy personnel.  I can't thank them enough for their dedication to help us, their kindness and professionalism.  The office and food services departments were always very attentive and helpful as well.  Thank you, everyone, for helping us in our time of great need.  God bless you all.

This place is the worst I have ever seen not only did my father pass away in this place many years ago but now I personally know why, I was put in here for after surgery rehab and I thank God I was taken out by family members after 1 day of being there. I hope I never have to go there again. Way too many reasons I hate it there. I wish I didnt have to give it any stars at all.</text>

<Review>My mom was there & she hated it. She was left exposed, left in the bathroom for 45 mins with the door closed. Thank God I spoke to the doctor who released her to my care. Although Administration was very helpful who tried to resolve any problems. It’s the nurses, they are overwhelmed, too many patients & not enough staff. This is what one nurse relayed to me. Watch your Love one closely there cause patients are usually unattended.< /Review></record>

<review>My wife was sent here about a montn ago for physical theraphy on her leg. From the second she got there @ 9 o'clock  she wasn't acknowledged  at all. It took the staff almost 3hr for them to realize she was a new patient if it wasn't for myself asking them for her meds and any documents they needed me to sign for her , they would have taken longer for her to get acknowledged , they also give u dirty looks  when u ask for there services. Also her pain meds where not even in there system  they had to re-order them. So she was in agonizing pain for about 16 hrs. Staff was suppose to help her in and out of bed do to the fact she was a fall risk, they did care at all she was made to get up on her own to the restroom. And back and also adjust her self on the bed when she wasn't able too cause she had cervical surgery. That got me so angry  I got my wife out there in 1 day. This place should  b shut down  do to the fac5 that they r very careless.....< /review><userid>113610226587934170539</userid>< rating>

The worst experience ever my father was here two days and got a rash! The nurses ignore the patients and are rude! This place is filthy and disgusting. There is no air in the rooms only where the nurse station is. Do not leave your loved ones here the worst experience ever!</Text>

From the first day until she was discharged my sister's care was wonderful. The entire staff are caring, compasionate and are highly skilled and efficient. Her case manager, Cindy Peel ushered her and our family with kindness and skill throughout her stay and guided us in finding another placement. Thank you Reche Canyon.</text>

The staff is barely attentive and give dirty looks when you ask for assistance making it almost a necessity to be there from open to close. My father developed blood clots which moved to his lungs after Kaiser had to re-stitch the incision because of an infection he developed because Reche left his back brace on 24/7 rarely turning him. After he was cleared they sent him back to reche where he spent 3 weeks of people leaving him alone in the dark, refusing medicine, ignoring his yells and screams for help and the physical therapy was a joke. This is a nursing home where very ill people go, not a facility to help get people up and going.This is the worst place I've ever been to.

Was supposed to receive physical therapy for his legs.
Instead was striped down, put in a paper diaper and told to stay in bed.
Horrible services. Patients are parked in a common room while the people that are supposed to take care of them, sit around and read newspapers and watch tv.
Don't let your loved ones go there.<//text>< UserId.>

My sister was here couple months ago. We put her in this facility for a week due to flu season, we all had flu and we did not want her to get sick. The second day after we brought her home she passed away due to their neglect. If you care for your love one do not take her there.< /Review>

this place is a piece of GARBAGE. they dropped my mother 3 times  & didn’t even want to give her an X RAY until i called & made them. TRANSFERRED HER TO ANOTHER FACILITY, & “NETWORK MARKETING FROM RECHE CANYON” CAME TO THE NEW FACILITY TO “CHECK ON HER”. FOR WHAT ?? YOU ALREADY DROPPED HER AND WANTED TO GIVE HER “TYLENOL”  FOR THE PAIN. THEY’VE BEEN GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND FOR YEARS. YOU ALL WILL GET WHATS COMING TO YOU. FROM THE HEAD NURSES RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE SOCIAL WORKER ELIZABETH WHO IS NEVER THERE !! YOU ALL WILL PAY.<//text>

<Text>Place is horrible. I wouldn't send my worst enemy there. My very dear friend acquired a staph infection there, they refused to give her pain medication & she ultimately died there. As she was taking her last breaths her doctors denied that she was dying & refused to give her medication to assist with her shortness of breath. This is coming from a hospice nurse.<//Text><rate>1< /rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

I was sent to Reche Canyon from Kaiser, Fontana  after 15 days in the Hospital, flat on my back. I am 85 years old and midway through my stay at Kaiser I had surgery to repair a torn diaphragm and liver from a broken rib. When they discharged me to Reche Canyon I had not been out of bed for 15 days. I arrived at Reche Canyon on Easter Sunday, April 16th with Oxygen @ 2% and couldn't even sit up by myself. The staff was wonderful, attentive, the food wan't too bad and best of all - NO SMELL. They worked with me every day and I was discharged on April 29th without any oxygen and able to get up out of bed and walking around the facility on my own, with a walker of course. I am very happy with the care I was given  here and would recommend this facility to anyone who must go to a skilled nursing facility.</text>

I hate to even give this place one star but I have to because it won't let me choose zero stars. BEWARE!  Worst place ever!!  My 22 year old son was sent here from Kaiser with a brain injury.  We only had four options of sub acute care facilities to choose from and Reche Canyon was the best of the worst. The first time he was sent there he was only there for four days when he had to be rushed back to the hospital with pneumonia as well as an unstageable bed wound (did not have this when he was discharged from Kaiser 4 days prior).  The bed wound was later staged at a stage 4. He was sent back to Reche Canyon two weeks later where his bed wound continued to get worse (down to his bone). Within a two month timeframe he was in the emergency room at Loma Linda 3 different times. The last straw for me was when they ended up having to bag him (CPR) because his oxygen saturation dropped below 50%, he was sent to the emergency room at Loma Linda where he then was transferred to Kaiser with pneumonia for the third time, a completely out of control bed wound,  and a staph infection. After that I did everything I could not to let them send him back to Reche Canyon. Reche Canyon almost killed my son due to the lack of care. I was there every single day with my son but they do not allow anybody to stay past 9 PM. So between 9:00 PM and the next day only God knows what they did with my son or didn't do with my son.  Plenty of times staff there would tell me that they are understaffed and this is why some patients don't get tended to properly, especially the patients that don't have family members to speak up for them. If your family member cannot speak for themselves DO NOT send them here. I have educated myself on patients rights and learned how to be an excellent advocate for my son.</Text>

My father, Wilburn Milligan is in room 112 and had to wait an hour for someone to give him pain medicine last night for his broken hip, he is almost 90 years old.
today he came back from dialysis and needed covers on and again his call button doesn't seem to work to get help! The lady with his dinner tray had to help him! I hope he has his pain medicine when he needs it tonight, or I will be filing a complaint! I called the hospital and got disconnected!</text>

<review>I loved everything about this place--the funky vibe, the bold flavors and the refreshing and tart Little Baobab, a tamarind based vodka drink with some passion fruit syrup.  The plantains were sweet and perfectly fried.  West African food is my new favorite.</review>< Pictures>

This place is awesome!! Honestly a really good spot! Came on a Friday night and the cover was $5 with rsvp online. Drinks where great, very strong & reasonably priced! It wasn't too packed here , didn't really get poppin until 11:30ish! Music was hip hop (all the good stuff) & loved the other room was the Spanish music ! Super cool! Also bathrooms were really clean which is nice for a club! Def recommend this place ! Will forsure go back!<//Review>

Nice environment grown crowed over 25 plus. The place is small.  Not should to shoulder small but it’s decent. The music is vercitile for instance pop rand b and more. I will come again. Happy hour around 6 so drinks are affordable. They did not have food so u may want to eat first. 😍😘😍😘</Text>

<Text>Went here to hang out with an old friend. The bartender of the bat ignored us and attended other before us. It takes from the experience of having a good time. I thought maybe he was having a bad day...idk but seemed to have an attitude we walked to another bar and came back luckily different bartender and was very polite and refilled my water anytime he saw it empty super appreciative...he made the 2nd time a better experience. Not sure if I would want to come and guess when it I will receive adequate service.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dcdf1a21d2adff:0x6fdd436fafa246b1< /GmapID></record>

<text>After getting some new bartenders, it's a great place to be. The new staff are attentive, quick and personable. It's a great place to grab a few drinks, which can quickly turn into spending the whole night there. The lighting is just right, where you aren't blinded but can maintain wallflower status just fine in the shadows. The jukebox is usually on point with everyone throwing in their hits and anthems throughout the night. The restrooms are clean and generally isn't too much of an issue with the wait. The pool table patrons are fun to watch. I just wish they didn't allow smoking right outside the door.<//text><Date>1539807419762</Date>< name>

The bartender that had my drink fixed was super nice regardless of having multiple drunk people flagging him for more drinks. It's a great hip place to unwind with friends but MAKE A RESERVATION. The line was horrid and I definitely learned my lesson to never skip out on calling in beforehand.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Tin Lizzie is a great spot! All the bartenders are very friendly and the regulars make you feel at home. The drinks are strong and they have a decent selection of beers, including Stella and Kona IPA. There's no food. Occasionally, snack bowls can be found with chips and nuts.
The entrance from the parking lot leads directly to a small and dark space with no windows. You'll immediately find a pool table and an old-school cigarette machine with the pull handles. The bar counter lines one wall and opposite that are refurbished banquettes with cocktail tables.
Tufted leather abounds and covers the banquettes, underneath the bar counter and the bathroom doors. Everything else is exposed brick. It adds a nice ambiance. The bathrooms are done up in subway tile. One each for guys and gals - single occupancy only. They're surprisingly and refreshingly clean.
A couple of flat screens are always turned to a movie or a football game and there's a touchtunes jukebox playing anything from Shania to The Roots. Be careful though, everyone pays extra to skip ahead!< /review></record>

I am extremely happy with the customer service, cleanliness and property management at Self Storage of Vacaville. From the first phone call to inquire about storage options to the day I arrived with a full moving van, they were professional and friendly and assisted me with securing a climate controlled unit for long term storage. I feel confident in the security of my belongings and highly recommend this as an option for anyone who needs a storage facility!</Text>

I have only had my unit about a week. So far, excellent!

I have now had my storage a couple of months and still doing fantastic. They were very considerate and worked w/me setting up a different account that they could have charged late fees for, but they did not. This is a huge factor and a definite 5 star rating!!<//review>

OMG......Michelle went above and beyond my expectations. She was a kick. She took me on a tour of available units and helped me through the whole process. She knows everyone of her customers. They have like a 1000 storage units!!! The office had water, cookies and candy for the guests. The unit was clean and I am very happy I decided to go with Self Storage of Vacaville.

<rating>5<//rating><review>We were looking for a storage facility that was convenient and close to home.  We drove by this place often, but we expected it to be really expensive because it's fairly new.  That is not the case!  There cost is very competitive, and I love that they keep their facility clean.  The staff is exceptional!  Matthew, Michelle and Jo are very welcoming and friendly.  They went above and beyond to answer our questions.  Give them a visit.  You won't be disappointed!< /review>< Pictures>

"My Storage Family" What an amazing team of individuals.  I feel I know each of you personally now.  My utmost respect for the high caliber customer service from day one on the telephone to my in-store visit. Feeling stressed over the coordination of my pods into your facility , all of you made it seamless. From the accommodating attitude to the personal conversations - you made the move fun.  The weather was 90+ on some days and I want to thank you so much for the cold water.  Hats off to all of you and your Mr. & Ms. mini carts.<//Text>

Staff are very friendly, down to earth and pleasant to talk to.  The process was quick and easy to understand.  Your "Special Promo" is what sold me on using Self Storage of Vacaville.  It worked for the timeframe I needed, and the units indoor was an option I never knew I had.  I also like that there is only one path to follow to find my unit, no maze.  I am extremely happy with Self Storage of Vacaville.  I would recommend this Storage Facility to everyone! It's a brand new building with lots of storage units still available!  Thank you to the Staff for making this process quick, easy and hassle-free!<//Text>

This is my first month with them and from the moment I drove up I was already happy. Clean and safe with very helpful staff. Michelle was sure to explain everything I needed to know in a very efficient pace since I was on my way to work. It was quick but I felt that I was very well informed and I made it to work on time thanks to Michelle. Great amazing place. Prices are great, staff is great, and the facility is beautiful. Highly recommend.<//review>

Our son found Self Storage of Vacaville, met Michelle, toured the facility and called to say how impressed he was.  Michelle found us two large climate controlled units adjacent to each other.  They worked with us long distance, and when the moving truck arrived coordinated the unloading of our possessions into the two units.  When we arrived, we too were impressed with the beautiful facility, but even more with the superb service.  Thanks!< /review>< user_id>

< Review>
VERY happy with Self Storage of Vacaville.  From the moment I made my first call to Self Storage of Vacaville to present I have been extremely pleased with the professional service provided by the staff.  They are friendly and helpful.  The units are clean, I love that the lights come on as I make my way through the halls and the special added touch of music playing lightly in the background.  Self Storage of Vacaville also provides rolling carts at the entrance of each building which makes moving items from car to unit pretty effortless.  They provided me with a lock of choice for my unit, an offer to use a Uhaul if needed and as a new business their sign up special offering is great.

I used a different storage company a couple of years ago for a few months, I constantly had problems with the auto pay and I didn't like that the gates were not accessible after the office closed which included holidays.  So far my experience at Vacaville Self Storage has far exceeded my expectations.< /Review>

I called this place because of the climate controlled rooms. I got Lindsay on the phone, my car was literally loaded and ready to drop off. Lindsay answered all my questions and had me ready to go in minutes. It couldn’t have been easier or Lindsay more helpful. I recommend them both highly!!< /Review>

This beautiful and clean facility has the state of the art design and technology such as password-enabled security gates and security cameras. You got to check it out!

The manager and staff are top-notch. They know the facility operations from top to bottom. But most of all, they treat you as a family. They assisted me all the way during the rental process. They always greeted with a smile every time I check my stuff in the storage.

Also, the facility has everything I need for storage needs - moving supplies and locks. Why need to go to another store when I have everything I need in this facility.

Self Storage of Vacaville is a great facility. I highly recommend it for your storage needs!</text>< response>

Wonderful customer service!! Michele was amazing and helped me to get my storage facility!! She gave me a tour of the property and was very helpful with determining storage size! I met Jo (manager) this morning and she was super sweet and very helpful with opening the gate to allow my movers through. This place is super clean, nice and full of helpful people that are here to help make your move/transition as smooth as possible! Not to mention they offer a military discount!!< /text>

Now that I'm a customer I wish I would've came so much sooner.
Staff is AWESOME very friendly and helpful! Didn't make us feel stupid or that we were wasting their time by asking questions and trying to figure out what size unit fits our needs.
Can't wait for a dump station and wash area for campers then I will bring that over here also.
Again a clean facility and a staff that makes you feel comfortable and is very helpful.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Such great staff, friendly, helpful, and the units are clean and have state-of-the-art protection systems built in.  When you open your door, and LED light comes on so you can see inside your unit.  Each unit is visible in a security camera system monitored 24/7.  Each unit has a break detector so if someone breaks in, security is notified immediately.  Every one that gains access to the facility has to type in a code and is catalogued.  They even have personal that live onsite for added security!

<Review>My family and I are apart of the Camp fire victims and have lost our home in Magalia, Ca, we have been receiving donations which are a huge blessing but beings we are staying at my moms we are short on room and need storage. We didn't have to look very far because the staff and owners at Self Storage of Vacaville listened to our story and helped us out immensely by giving us a payment of 0 for 6 months. The owners and the staff of this establishment have enormous hearts and we greatly appreciate the enormous gift they have given us! The grounds and storage units are brand new and very well maintained! I will be telling all my friends and family what they  have done for our family for years to come. on behalf of my family I want to say thank you for the awesome experience.

<Time>1550381762102</Time><review>Oh my gosh!! I don’t know if I have the right words to describe our experience at Self Service of Vacaville! This place is simply AMAZING!! Everything about this place from the cleanliness, to the state of the art security system, to the automatic lights and music in the hallways!! And heck, I haven’t even gotten to the service yet! When I called, I spoke with Michelle. She was so kind and patient on the phone with me. You would think that’s supposed to be normal but not so much nowadays. She answered all my questions and then offered more information that I didn’t even think of to ask. Then when we got there, we dealt with Matthew. Holy moly, could he have been anymore patient and accommodating?! So easy to work with!and just a great guy. We’re a small nonprofit and every little penny helps! So what did Matt do? He called his manager Jo, to help us out. And you know what, they did!!! As far as managers go, Jo and Lindsey take the cake! I have to say, if you need to store anything, you would be silly not to check with them FIRST!! Incredible service and great staff!! Plus, they have awesome discounts but really go for some good ol’ fashion customer service because you don’t get it like that too much anymore.< /review>< Response>

A top place for tasty Buffet food. Cool location to meet with coworkers. Had a friend come into town and asked me to take him here again. This place has a great feel to it. Food is like a restaurant in Louisville I loved.< /Review>

You may want to question the price, but once You realize you're in your 3rd plate... You understand why! There is a good assortment of Asian cuisine. The Mongolian cook is the best and that option makes the visit worth it. The sushi is updated regularly and the ribs are fantastic. The vegetable and meat dishes are tender and the vegetables are cooked to damn near perfection. There are baked and fried fish options, and all of them are a good choice. Don't worry about a salad, go straight to the heavy stuff!</Review>

I like this spot! They serve first-cleass meals, their menu is rich, The chief cook in that place is a real authority in the kitchen, I love very much tasting all their dishes. The food is always good, the attitude towards the guests  is friendly. I visit often this place and I was never discontended. Highly recommended.<//Text>

The buffet inside the mall is a pretty good find. The food taste good, lots of seafood options, sushi, a section where they cook it in front of you too. Not like hometown buffet. I'd recommend it. Service is ok, nothing to write home about.< /text>

<review>Its alright if you're trying to get something that seems fancy but isn't. Pros; The staff is really friendly and cool. Clean place, the tables and chairs were clean as so was the area where we sat. Cons; they obviously reuse some of the food like they would use the old orange chicken and dump it ontop of the new one. Over all great place to eat if you're out with your friends and want a cheap but fair bite.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I don't know if the cashier was having a bad day or what..he was rude
When we were seated the table was nasty we had to ask twice for the table to be cleaned. And the sad part is we went at 10:50a they were just opening. As we finished eating and went to get another plate the dirty dishes were still sitting on my table so I politely moved the dirty dishes to a clean table and you should have seen how quickly the girl picked those dishes up..lol
I can understand if they had a full house they didn't in fact there were only 6 people eating..
This is not a good way to do business and this was my first and last time visiting.
If the owner happens to read this review, just know that my green money spends just as good as any one else's. Your staff needs to be retrained!!!!
That is all.<//review>

Came here once during dinner food was amazing I came today 2/13 on a date and as I’m eating I find a Bristol from the scrub brush which I know only comes from the kitchen I went to tell the male manager because I’m pregnant and that could have been a hell of lawsuit if I would of got sick or and thing was to happen to my baby . When I told him he was nonchalant about it shrug his shoulders and say okay .. as a businessman he should know that customer service is everything satisfied customer is a successful business but they have definitely lost a customer because of his professionalism. After I stated that I was going to leave my review the lady waitress told me to make another plate but I couldn’t eat anymore appetite was ruined and I want that certain food the Bristol was in..< /Review>

<Text>This place used to be good many years ago. Me and my children went yesterday. I paid with a credit card and told the cashier I would pay the tip in cash. The crab was cold the waiter nor waitresses picked up the used plates we had finished they never offered us any refills. The only person in that restaurant who was accommodating that I did tip was the man who worked the grill. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. After we finished I told the cashier that she must have told them I didnt tip after I told her I was tipping in cash. She never apologized or anything. The food definitely isnt good either👎👎👎👎👎👎</Text>< user_id>

Food was ok, customer service was horrible very rude waitress my mother asked for a refill and the waitress came back with a lemonade and my mom said “I had sprite” and she smacked her lips and walked away. And came back and kinda slammed the sprite on the table and didn’t even fill it all the way up. And then I asked a waiter do they have crab legs and he replied and said “I don’t know look” with an attitude. Restrooms were dirty & wet I almost slipped going in there. I will not return any time soon.< /Review>

< review>
Went on Friday night, usually best quality is offered at buffets on this day; Saturday and Sunday as well.

Went there hungry AF post workout with high hopes and was disappointed with everything.

Everything looked like it was from the Lunch buffet and was dry or overly oily, the fresh BBQ was serving rancid meat--you know that taste when beef is semi-ok but has the spoiled taste and smell to it.

I will never be back here.

New Panda Buffet a mile or so West is much better and cheaper, this place just looks nice.</review>

I went with my family of 5 and I will never be back. The food looked like it had been out for quite some time and even when we complained and they agreed they did not remove the food and replace it. Even my raspberries iced tea tasted watered down. We were there on a Friday at 8pm and it was not busy. We were lucky to at least get half of our money back. Edited in, the soup containers were left open and looked nasty and had grew a nasty film in the containers.< /text>

This buffet is located in the mall.lunch was ten dollars.grill had beef chicken and pork.no knife in silverware set must get your own knife.soup containers were not covered which to me seems like a health hazard. Anybody coughing saliva goes in the soup.fruit was delicious.sushi ok.good selection variety.fish available was shrimp and others but no crablegs.good parking.plenty of security cameras in restaurant. Lunch deal is a good price for lunch.they need to replace their knives.they looked like they had been run over by a truck.nothing you want to eat with.i would return here with guests for lunch and i would bring my own knife.music was very relaxing.no words.< /review>

<review>It looks like a nice place but when we were about to be seated our table wasn't clean at first before we sat but at least they cleaned it. But i noticed some of tables dont get clean right when the people leave, they clean it when you about to be seated 🤔. The bathrooms little dirty, cleaning supplies/chemicals was out on the floor near the handwash sink(watch your kids👶), some of serving area wasn't wiped down some of the food was off and some look or tasted like its been there for hours (thats just my opinion) for example i like sushi so i started getting some in the serving area and when i try it I spit it out because it didnt taste fresh it tasted old 😖, i notice that one of the kids cups was chipped on the top of the cup (at least it wasn't glass cup 😬) and the servers dont come to check on us often and i see some dirty rags they use to wipe the tables and some are left on the tables 😳. Most food was not good at all, I'm sorry we wont be coming back 😐< /review>< Pictures>

This is very expensive. For example 2 adults and a 10 yo was $31. But other than that the meal is amazing. My family is obsessed with the crab legs and the sushi. They have many food selections such as every sushi, crab legs(fried too),orange chicken,Chowmain, shrimp,etc.< /text>

New and improved for sure!! They move people in and out so fast that everything is fresh. Love the seafood selection.. crab cakes and sushi being my favs. They don't rush or pressure you to hurry in any way either. Dessert menu is a little smaller on than before but definitely more selection on foods. I'm already feeling my waist expanding.. lol!!</review>

Food like sushi is hard from being out too long, fried foods are not crunchy as they should be, fish tasted super fishy (old fish?), Chicken (wings) tasted really gamey and bbq ribs looked super old and dry but looked as if someone recently re-slathered bbq sauce on them..
Waiter was attentive in coming around to pick up the plates for the most part. Soda was extremely watered down and not carbonated.
The waitress at the end was so sweet, when she dropped off pieces of candy (at the end) she saw 2 were same flavors, and she just swapped one out. Something which can be considered so trivial but i found so sweet.
Unfortunately food made me and my SO's tummy hurt. So i think it will be the last time i will be dining here..<//text>< pictures>

The buffet is not worth the price at all. The entire place smells like a bathroom and there is a major lack of hospitality. The quality of the food was subpar, especially the sushi. It looked like was sitting out all day. The place really needs a makeover! Staff, food, and service included< /review>

The staff obviously lacks in staff training because first of all the waiter dropped the left overs of a other customer on my child and they hit my child with a plate and I know it was accident but the waiter could’ve at least apologized because how are you going to be walking then let plates slip onto an other table so unprofessional  and let me tell you about the new cook and how horrible he is “he cooks it but in reality he just puts it on the grill for 4 min then serves it to you raw< /Text>

<Review>Their service was terrible. Rude waiter with rude manager. I found a hair in my food and wanted a refund and their was no manager. We were told the hair could have come from the customers even though as the table next to us is listening in , they explain to their waiter thier food also had hair in it . Once i go to the counter for a refund, im met by a older family that was getting a refund because. A WORM/MAGGOT CRAWLED OUT THEIR FOOD. None of the food was even hot which is a big food safe nono. Food was Cleary left out and was served at room temperture. I still want a full fefund for my party if 3 i paid for ..  Only got a 20 % refund for 1 meal 3 bucks.This was at Americana Buffet and Grill. Picture is supposed to be fresh gravy!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I never thought I'd get to eat at a buffet of this calibre outside of being a tourist in Florida last summer but as with so many things in my life... I stand corrected.

I was KO'ed quick, barely making it halfway through my second plate and half lying down in the booth watching my girlfriend tear through plate number I lost count of crab legs.

Come ready to eat and have a place close by to call it a night right after because I was out for the count!<//Text>

I like chinesse food, this place offer a variety of food for a resonable price, but, sometimes the fruit was spoiled, last time I took a plate but it was full of grease, asian people whp works there are serious and the waitress is litle bit rude, they can be slow if you ask for refill, and yes, all the place is dirty, tables and floors and more important, the restroom is so dirty, smell really bad, they most improve in these areas, the buffet most maintain a cleaning standar< /review>

This place has the worst customer service I’ve came across. Food is not good. I put up a plate so they can make Mongolian and they took almost 10 minutes to send somebody up to cook it and on top of that, it was doused in oil. If you payed lunch than you can’t eat the crab legs, only dinner, and if you accidentally grab the legs without knowing, they will try and make you pay for the legs you grabbed.<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The food is fine with the exception that the grated cheese they had already had a bad taste like when it spoils. The rest of the food rich. But lousy waitresses didn't even bring us the drinks until after I ordered them several times. And it was not a very busy day, so that was not an excuse for not being attentive, nor did they lift the dishes where we had finished eating.

(Original)
La comida está bien con la excepción que el queso rallado que tenían ya tenía un mal sabor como cuando se echa a perder. El resto de la comida rica. Pero pésimas meseras nisiquiera nos llevaron las bebidas asta después de que se las pedí varias veces. Y no era un día muy ocupado asi que esa no era una excusa para no estar atentas tampoco levantaron los platos adonde ya habíamos terminado de comer.</Text>< Pics>
