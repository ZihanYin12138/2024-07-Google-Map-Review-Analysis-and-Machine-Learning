<Text>Stopped by early Saturday morning to drop off some prepaid packages to be delivered by Christmas. Parking can be a bit hard, but overall it wasn’t a long wait. I was in and out in less than a minute and my packages have already arrived at their destination. In the past when purchasing postage in person, Margie was always the best!

<review>Ordered from crocs, package was primarily with ups then transferred to Usps. Now, it says undeliverable due to incomplete address and it’s been since August 8 2020; how is it incomplete and yet they deliver my mail just fine? I called a rep and they said my address on the package is correct but yet I haven’t received anything. I’m contemplating in driving to the office but based on everyone’s experience, I don’t think it would matter.</review><UserId.>117868062570114553792</UserId.>< Name>

This place should have zero stars! The passport man is incredibly rude. He said I have to make an appointment for passport renewal even though I'm an adult and their website doesn't allow it. It's the third time they refuse to help me! Super rude, and was only nice to the girl in front of me because he was flirting, which was creepy.<//review>

I had a package sent through USPS. I got a notification that my package had been delivered but when I checked, my package was not there. I even looked up the tracking number online just to be sure and according to the usps website, my package was delivered in my secured mailbox. I tried calling my local post office several times but no one has answered. I’m all for eliminating the post office at this point. It’s such a useless service and should not continue receiving money from the federal government.</Text>

< Review>
This is the third time they have a package out for delivery and the package never arrives to my address. The tracking number indicates that the item is "Awaiting Scan," and therefore is back to the Post Office. I have been calling a few times and they promised to look for the package and will call me but never do. Last time, they left a massage for the supervisor (Named Anthony) to look and try to find the package. I called Anthony twice and never returned my call. I understand that a piece of mail can be missing, but I think the Postmaster and some of the staff at this office don't care much about how important a package can be. Calling this office is useless, they never called me back with any information.<//Review>

Ordered something on Ebay Nov. 21 and said it was suppose to arrive Friday Nov. 29 But it’s already December 1st and NO SHIPMENT YET. tracking says its stuck in this USPS location and has not been scanned. I’m really disappointed because it was a time sensitive thing I needed and I wont be able to use it. Slow service and pretty pathetic excuse for a USPS service< /review>

But Laurie is by far the rudest and hard to read I couldnt tell if she was coming off rude or irritated.

We have been living at La Puente for nearly two to three months now. Despite getting mail sent to our home, this post office kept intercepting and returning state-issued letters back to the state. It took nearly 2 months to finally catch up with the State Department of where my mother works at to find out that this Post Office had been resending letters back; making my mom delayed for work!

Goodness. I wonder whose logic it was to send a state-issued letter back despite its correct address & name.

Going in to meet with the later today; will update on how customer service is.</text>

We had to make a new mail box because the kids from the high school kept taking it apart so we made a new one and it's 2 1/2 feet from where the original one was.

All the other mail men deliver our mail and I am so thankful for them. Why can't she just do her job it's not hard! She even started not even stopping she drives by. If you can catch her she will hand you the mail but can't get her butt out of her truck to put it in the box! When we had the original box, if there was a car she would get out to deliver our mail why can't she do that now!!! I now am missing my insurance cards that were sent out February 9th. This is HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE! And the post master should be so embarrassed!!!!
I will not stand for this and will keep fighting till she does her job!! Called the post office who said she has some disability that she can't get out of the truck but she has issues with other people as well. She chooses who's mail she want to deliver. So has now started seeing my mail back to sender and not holding it at all. So now I have to but a PO Box to get my mail.

They do not take walk-ins for passports, despite what their website says. They have a phone number posted on the window. But it doesn’t get answered until after 10, despite the office opening at 9. So if you get there early for a passport, doesn’t matter if there is no one in line, you cannot stay and wait to be seen.<//Review>

They lost 2 of my packages within a week and I’m sure my mail is missing too because I’ve been waiting on a letter. They suck.

Update: I went directly to post office to complain about missing packages and I was able to speak to the mail lady who delivers my mail and she insisted I received my packages but that’s not true because my packages are not delivered even after being marked delivered. Unbelievably bad service.</text>

<review>Just last week I went in to get a new p.o. box there , I am new to the city and I had a few packages delivered just yesterday . However, they said my name wasn't on my mailbox so they didn't know who's package it was ? I Mean, it does have my p.o box number they couldn't just leave a yellow slip even though? So when I went to check , my packages had already been sent back to the sender ! I'm like already ?? It just got delievered ! That black lady that assisted was lazy af ! I had to go in a second time just to double check on my package and she finally went to the back to check.  Worst post office ! I am closing my p.o box and going to another location ..< /review>< pics>

<Review>If there was a way I could start to tell you to completely avoid this post office, I would but if you, unfortunately are a resident to this city and you have not had any incidents yet, don't ever be surprised if you have one or more than a few. After reading reviews that are mostly negative and also reflect my views and feelings regarding this post office, I just have to add that I thought I was of the few going through this but apparently not. The mail man that drops the mail off here also puts my mail and packages in other peoples mail box and if I'm lucky and the recipient is honest, I'll get my package, otherwise, it's considered a loss. Workers are lazy and rude at times and they will cover up for each other when mistakes are made! Don't bother walking into the post office to make a complaint! You'll have to go above and start there. If possible, send things that you order online to the home of someone you know to avoid the stress, trouble and loss.< /Review>< pics>

This facility has had a package of mine for over 7 business days and hasn't processed it yet. I try to call their location and I keep getting transferred to a busy tone. What is going on with this location? There are several other customers leaving the same review with the same issue.< /review>

<Text>This place is beyond ridiculous. This is the second time a package is said to be out for delivery but never makes it to me. Then I'll call and be told "oh, it'll arrive tomorrow" and twice I've waited for tomorrow, and the day after, and so on, and it won't arrive! This is upsetting since I pay for my shipping to ensure delivery yet even then I don't receive my items when I'm supposed to! Also, I'm constantly being mailed other people's correspondence and mine will be mailed incorrectly as well. I thought postal workers were given adequate training in order to do their jobs properly. Seems that is not the case however..<//Text><Name>Brenda Calmar< /Name><user>116121834784256379190</user>< time>

It is very sad that our carrier isnt delivering our mail (missing items) and we are getting mail from homes up to 2 blocks away. they need to be more careful and also. Our carrier was suppose to take a bill i put in the box she dropped it and wasn't gonna even stop to pick it up till I called her on it . very sad service< /Text>

These people are a complete joke. They have the most pathetic excuse for customer service. It will take you about an hour of dialing and redialng to even get through. Why? Because once they answer they put you on hold until you can take no more and hang up. I sat on the phone waiting for a supervisor for over an hour. To find out where my package they  lost might be. I still haven't been helped. Don't even bother calling they will not help you! Just go to the location or you will be beyond frustrated, with a 2 hour phone call like me, that gets you no help whatsoever!!! I called back again and when I finally got through they didn't even say hello. The phone rang and I was automatically put on hold. How incredibly rude!!!</Text>

This is not the first time I have had poor service from a carrier working out of this office.  Now I must stand in their extremely long line to file a complaint.

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>RUDE STAFF! VERY HARD TO GET AN ANSWER WHEN YOU CALL!
On May 11, 2018, I submitted a intercept request through the USPS website. My package was successfully intercepted on May 12, 2018 at 7:41 am. I waited and waited, and never received my package. On May 26, 2018, I called the La Puente, California post office to find out why my packaged had not been sent back to me, and why there hadn't been any tracking updates since May 12, 2018. The woman I spoke to (I cannot remember her name) told me, "your package was in Princeton, WV on May 14th. You should have gotten it." I called my local post office, and spoke to Trish (very helpful, nice woman). She informed me that the package had never been in Princeton, or even in West Virginia. Shortly after speaking to Trish, I received an updated tracking email that stated, "MOVED, LEFT NO ADDRESS" on May 26, 2018 at 11:21 am. With intelligent deduction, I realized that the woman I spoke to in La Puente lied to me, and the package was scanned right after I spoke to her. On May 29, 2018 at 8:47 am, I received another update that stated, "ADDRESSEE UNKNOWN." I received a call from La Puente USPS stating the package should be coming back to me now. The package arrived in Charleston, WV on June 2nd, but was sent back to La Puente, CA USPS. It arrived in CA on June 4, 2018 at 5:01 am. I called repeatedly for close to two hours, and the phone was finally answered with a quick, "please hold," and I was placed on hold for 30 minutes. I asked to speak to a manager, but the man I spoke to did not let me speak to one, and told me to explain everything to him. I gave him the tracking number, and asked if they could PLEASE just print a NEW label with my address, so that I know it will come back to me. He told me no, they couldn't do that. He said that he would take my number and "try to contact the driver to intercept the package." WHAT?!?! It should have never left their post office to go anywhere but back to me.</text>< pics>

<Text>If I could give them negative stars I would.  Let me just say between our mail carrier,Sammy and the supervisor  Otto they have lied and made up false "reports" and created the biggest issue out of nothing. Not only have they lied to me and my husband's face they claimed that my husband agreed to something he never even said. If you have any issue with this office go straight to the inspector general and file a complaint before they can make false official reports without you knowing. They are threatening me with having to get a p.o. box for something that isn't an issue. Believe me the thought of going down to that horrible, depressing office is giving me anxiety! Absolutely horrible service on all ends with this office. I'm seriously considering moving simply on the fact that my rights do not exist to these workers.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

two f-ups in one month.  worst post office ever.  worst customer service ever. call and they don't say anything and they place you on hold.  they forget about you, and their line is almost always busy.  probably from the constant complaints.  I hate that La Puente has such a sh***y post office. the worst f***ing post office and service. makes me less patriotic.< /Text>

I called them to wonder if they had any information on my missing package; the woman that picked up was not helpful, stating that I will have to wait up to 30 days for a response on my approved claim.
Horrible customer service, was not willing to help, I am not surprised my package is missing.< /Text>

I don't like anything about this post office location. Mainly because the mail persons delivering the mail consistently give us our neighbors mail which makes no sense because 2733 and 2741 although next door to one another, look nothing alike as far as numerical or physical appearance. Not only that but the house numbers are on the curbs AND on the edge of the roof or on the exterior of the house in some shape, form or fashion. Furthermore, they deliver in broad daylight so it can't be that they can't see the house numbers - I think this is just plain laziness and ineptitude. Next don't even try to call the post office to get answers. I've been waiting for two EXTREMELY important pieces of mail for over a month now and have not received them yet and everytime I dial the mail center, I'm greeted with the busy signal that we all know is like nails on a chalkboard when we're in a situation of trying to get business handled. I've called the places issuing the items I'm waiting for and unfortunately they won't allow me to have the items re-routed to another address like a P.O. Box, which sucks. I wish I had known about these mail delivery problems before moving into Rowland Heights ... Definitely would've thought twice - For Pete's sake it's MAIL DELIVERY!!! - How hard is it to deliver timely to the proper address? Anyway - ranting tangent is over - To the mail delivery person or people responsible for the mix ups with my and everyone else's mail - You're NUMBER ONE!!! to me and it ain't the index finger I'm puttin' up!< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>This is thee worst post office. Unfortunately they handle all mail for la puente and rowland heights. When you track your package its almost always incorrect. It will say "out for delivery" but you wont actually get it till 2 days later. Even worst sometime it will say "DELIVERED" and you wont even have it. You are probably wonder how or why this happens. Simple lazy workers both at the sort facility and outbound delivery. They will scan your package as out for delivery  or DELIVERED just to save time on there part so in there systems it shows they work fast. Pathetic..... Many people not just me have complained but nothing is being done. What can we do? Its the government's mail service. They dont care.<//text>< date>

3 times I have ordered stuff from either Amazon or ebay and they never seem to deliver the packages!!!! They say they do but they don't. They either keep it or deliver it somewhere else. From now on, I just request either Amazon or eBay to deliver thru fedex or ups.</text>

Actually a 0 a minus 5 if I could give it.
My postal carrier is a retard and a liar.
He couldn't find my mailbox if I threw it thru his windshield.
Don't know why this guy has a job!!!< /text>

Just watched the mail carrier throw a box over the gate of a neighbor instead of using the door bell on the front gate. NOT ACCEPTABLE! This is the LA Puente,  CA postal service.  No wonder people are so fed up with the USPS#<//review>

<Text>Bought a groupon for laser hair removal. They offer many other services and you can usually do a consultation and service the same day. Nurse was very nice, the process was quick and easy. 2 hr free street parking. Was my 1st time getting lasered, I recommend using the numbing gel they provide (arrive 20 min early) or buying your own.</Text>< Pics>

It was a pretty  good experience so far I'll be back with more results in 2weeks after I see the outcome of these eyebrows I'm still a bit of a crybaby but as of right now  the little pain I experienced getting these brows that I have now are So So worth 🤩 it I'm in love and will be recommending someone else in fact I already did she has an appointment already</text>

They did a nice manicure and pedicure job for a not cheap but decent price, and they did my eyebrows well. I also enjoyed the color of the nail polish. Service was impeccable, Everything was clean and they cleaned thoroughly in front of me. The spa was nice, as well as the massage chair. One of them even put my socks/shoes back on me which I thought was preposterous but a nice gesture. It was open late, and they took me in even though I barely gave any notice. English not their strong point, but they were nice and courteous when they did speak. It was very pretty inside with nice colors. Yea, can't think of one complaint. Oh but they will take credit card with a slight fee, but prefer cash.< /Text>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><time>1522599847082<//time><Name>Nikita G< /Name><review>4.5 stars!  I've gone here for eyelash extensions and the eyebrow microblading. The eyelash extensions I got looked absolutely amazing, but the person that did them did a 2-3:1 ratio thus making them too heavy. With so many lashes around my real lashes, whenever a lash fell out it took my real one with it.
The eyebrow microblading by Linda is AMAZING. I love the work she does so much! The first time I went, she gave me some great shape and did a thinner brow (I had very little to work with since my eyebrows are blonde). When I went to get my touch-up after two months, she made them thicker and fuller. They look so great!
Online appointments make it super easy to book here (and you get a text reminder). You can pay with credit card (with a fee I think) and tips must be in cash. They have a Groupon, but they'd rather you not buy it and they'll give you the Groupon rate in person (more money in their pocket I think).</review></record>

<user_name>Tanya Boyce< /user_name><review>Do NOT go here for lash extension.
1st its NOT a spa. Its a hair/nail shop where they do beauty treatments.
2nd they did not make me feel welcomed. 3rd its hard to relax with the clatter of loud talking over the roar of a blow dryer. Finally, every single lash fell out the every next day. I never washed my face or apply any product but the next day i woke with lashes all over my face and pillow. 70 bucks plus a 20 buck tip and no one ever saw my lashes. I called them immediately, they never answered the phone. I left two.messages and they never called me back. Total trash experience. Stay Away!<//review>< pictures>

Skip this place. Service was highly unprofessional.

Scheduled an appointment to find out that the person who was going to see me was doing a 30 minute manicure for herself first. During the actual session she had to change procedure midway because she wasn't there to check the details initially. There was a nice front desk girl and doctor.</text>

positive feedback~
First off, I read a review about this place and I guess they supposedly kept rescheduling this customer's appointment and then ended up calling after weeks later, canceling everything, saying they no longer do that. Anyway, the reason why I mentioned that was because I made an appointment before reading this review and I was scared that they were gonna do the same.. THEYY DIDN'T Fortunately! Result, after my appointment: she did exactly what I asked for, although I hoped for more curls in my hair, but it's like whatever.

negative: This is why I'm giving this place a 2 star out of 5.

[Before my actual appointment]
When I came to this place, it was very nice looking! I came because I called a few days if I can come in to schedule an appointment, they said sure of course, " can you come on this day.... around this time...?" I agreed. Anyway, I came in, but I had to wait for maybe 30 mins to actually schedule my appointment. I didn't think much about it because I just assume they were busy. After, waiting 30 mins or so, The woman in charge finally got to us and the first thing I notice was that she seemed stress. Like I TOTALLY get it, it's work and all.. I stress, BUT like I'm just shock because I feel like in my 18 years I've never met someone who works at a public place to give me, the customer such an odd vibe.

*month later.. it's my appointment day*

[Appointment day: Getting my hair done and Makeup]
I came to the place 10 mins before my actual appointment! I was hoping that within those 10 mins they would be like "oh she's here, okey I guess I should get ready to do her hair and all" ..... but like no that wasn't the case. They sat me down where I was gonna get my hair done. I waited for 40 mins... How busy were they you may ask? Not busy. They sat me in a different room and I was looking around, facing the mirror.
Anyway, so after waiting for a long time, the woman in charge (I'm sorry but idk her name) finally came out of nowhere. She came with that same vibe from last time.. right when she came into the room she through her phone at the mirror and started doing my hair. She doesn't greet me at all.   At the moment, I honestly thought I was gonna die because she made me feel so unsafe. Plus, she was very rude and her actions are shocking. Also, I had a camera with me... when she out of nowhere started doing my hair, she was spraying this thing in my hair that made my phone screen and my camera a little crusty. She didn't  put on the cape that covers your clothing when getting a hair cut or getting your hair done. Then, right after she was almost finished with my hair she finally put (cape) it on...

Anyhow, I really don't recommend this place because the waiting is long, out of all the people, I just thought she was rude and she needs to get her act together.< /Text>

This is a disrespectful place where the doctor is very rude and they changed my appointments for three times and finally they said it can’t be done.
## the price which I had in Groupon went higher they ruined the time and money.
## pls don’t visit here ever and ever it’s my real time experience
## no one should suffer this again pls pls don’t visit here
## the doctor itself suggested to do somewhere else then what is the need of going here and wasting time.
## pls go through my picture for reshuduled appointments<//Text>

This is a wonderful Salon with an outstanding staff of stylists.
Jessica Mansel is who I would personally recommend as she is a master of fading and leaves me feeling good each time she cuts my hair. I would highly recommend this Salon to everyone. Thanks la Princesse Salon and Spa!!!< /Review>

I  bought a groupon for laser hair removal for this place. The first time I called to make an appt the receptionist said I needed to come in anytime for a consultation. After reading all the horrible reviews on yelp, I decided to make an appt so I would be seen ontime. I got there 10 minutes early & was told, I was early & had to wait. About 10 minutes later I was told the lady was busy and I would need to come back. The whole thing just seemed a little shady. I’m sure they’re great for some things but I definitely don’t want them putting lasers anywhere near me. Luckily Groupon gave me my money back.<//text>

My husband and I have been regular customers for many years.  The care and attention that we are given is top notch!  The manicurists are wonderful, and I am especially fond of Sivatha.  She goes out of her way to give the best mani pedi.

John does a great job on my husband's and my hair.  His work is always consistently good, and we are always pleased with the results. John puts in the extra time and effort with his customers to keep us pleased and looking our best.</text>

Groupon has Great deals for here! The hardest worker in this place is Linda, she runs the place. They do everything here from microblading, eyelash extensions, wedding makeup, Manis and pedis, haircut and wash, and anything else you can think of. It is really an all-around Salon and Spa!< /Text>

<user_name>Stevie Desierto<//user_name><review>Well first off they have so many different flavors and items to choose from so whatever you are craving they almost definitely will have the flavor. My favorite is the princess flavored shaved ice with a Bahama Rama Mama which is their ice cream and tropic creme add on! Make sure you ask to add the BRM to your snow every time!< /review>< gmapID>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>I am from Arizona, where I regularly get treats from Bahama Buck's. I happened upon this location in HB on 11/5/17 after a trip to the grocery store. It was right before they closed, so if they didnt want to serve us, they should have said "sorry, we're closed" and I honestly wish they would have said that. The price was about a dollar more than AZ locations but we didn't care because we were excited to find that they even exist in CA. Well, as we're being rung up, the guy making our shaved ice yells to the cashier "IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE TO-GO!" We say Yes that's fine, cuz we were planning on that anyway. Well then he brings over our order, and throws it down without looking at us or saying anything. It's a complete rip-off disappointment; completely flat cup of smashed flat shaved ice with a flat soda lid on top and an umbrella in the straw hole. I come here for the cup of shaved ice that is ALWAYS a colorful MOUNTAIN that towers about 3 or 4 inches above the rim of the cup. This kid is needs to be fired, he ripped me off and completely killed my fascination with this place.</text><date>1510029775762< /date></record>

Growing up on raspaldos which is a mexican iceing desert. SO GLAD to find a place to bring back those childhood memories with even more options. After trying a variety of their flavors. I found one that reminds me of a orange creamsicle. Thank You for the Sweet memories.</Review>

The real bummer is that I had three $10.00 Groupon's that I wanted to use. The middle school jr. high group from Beachpoint Church which is about 25 kids headed over one night after church. The kids all got in line to order individually and since I had the Groupons I wanted to help out the kids that needs the financial help. Two kids ordered and the total was $9.02 and so I paid with the 1st Groupon (I did not get change because it was a Groupon) then three more kids ordered, the total was over $12.00 when I went to pay for them I was told I could not use another Groupon. Of course no manager was on duty and so I just paid out of pocket for the 3 kids that just ordered.  I was not happy.... I spent more than the Groupon Cost!!! Terrible costumer experience and that is why I am writing this review.<//Review></record>

Very friendly staff, nice clean environment, only flaw is last few visits they havent add enough off the flavor you want leaving the middle all white and tasteless so if you dont eat there you are screwed and stuck with it<//text>

<Time>1574195374030<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>This is an incredible sushi place. Authentic, classy, and delicious. I got the Vegetable Roll and the Tempura California Roll. The vegetable roll is good for vegetarians or people who don't like fish, but the tempura California is the most amazing sushi I've ever tasted. Not overpowering, but a perfect blend of rich flavors and a great crunchy&creamy texture. Definitely the best sushi place around, and they have a wide variety of rolls, as well as many other options.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeTdwBMFIVJ2TskdtzjXY51kmH2DqoLuf-qQ6M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

The food is very consistent and it's great for people who like more of the American-style sushi rolls with many many options. Pricing is still fair and they also have some happy hour options. Portion sizes are good.

Average service, just don't expect a fancy restaurant experience.</Text>< Pics>

However I do have a confession to make. A few months ago I went to Hara and stole one of their plates, I then flew to Colombia and left it at Pablo Escobar's tomb as a tribute.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Sub par food regardless of exceptional service during an obviously quiet afternoon. Quality is under financial expectation. Heard good things but was disappointed. Will likely eat at familiar better places. I wish I had better things to say but I’m being honest.<//Review>< Pics>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>Surprisingly disappointing given all the positive reviews. Fish wasn’t very good quality, rice tasted old and gummy, gyoza was basically a Totino’s pizza roll. Maybe that’s what I get for getting take-out sushi though? Price was great, hence the two stars, but for a couple bucks more Tom’s Sushi House (two blocks south) is significantly better.</text>< pics>

Good Japanese food at a decent price, especially for the westside. The lunch/dinner combos are a good deal. Make sure to ask for the miso soup -- it's included, but they don't give it unless you ask. The COVID-19 take out situation is pretty well handled too. Nearly contactless, though you do have to go inside and use a credit card machine, it's pretty well set up.< /text>

Very nice place on Wilshire with excellent food and fine prices.
A very friendly atmosphere and if you sit at the bar, you can watch the chefs prepare your food.
Very good!</Text>

<Review>Decent sushi for OK prices.  The menu for the rolls (which is what we ordered mostly) is a bit confusing. with over 50 baked and fresh sushi rolls all mixed with no particular order and then the photos separately on another menu made it hard choose. But otherwise everything tasted OK.<//Review>< resp>

<Review>I love this place and have been going for years. They have great half-price lunch specials and you can still sit at the bar and watch their young sushi chefs laugh and chat and create great food. It is loud and echoes a lot, so better for small groups.  They have enough servers and the service is fast, plus tons of fun, fancy rolls to choose from for a special night. Not cheap but fairly priced, not over-priced. Parking on nearby streets is also easier than many other LA locations.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<name>Mamalista's Way Erica Levi</name>< Review>
***Update: Went from 5 stars to 2.  We loved this place, but the last few times we went it was just sad. The fish was cut smaller and lots more rice, the temp went from being ice cold  to now being served warm and finally the prices went up even with the portions getting smaller. We’ve found other local places that are taking its place. ***

They are always busy, but usually not a wait longer than 5 mins of all the times  we've ever eaten there.  Sushi chefs are fast and make good dishes. The sushi comes out nice and cold, too. We are a family of two adults and 5 kids, and all leave full and happy!  My kids are gluten free and one extremely picky eater, and they accommodate us perfectly.  Has room for large groups. Big screen TVs and music, so not a quiet place which makes it perfect for families!<//Review>

Good sushi for the price, something affordable compared to the plethora of expensive sushi in LA. A nice scene for large groups of post-college aged people, and a good mix of fast food savory and higher quality sushi.
I've lived next to Hara since I was a child, and seen the restaurant evolve and devolve over time. While there have been times where the sushi seemed rushed and low quality shortly after their growth from a hole-in-the-wall to a bigger restaurant, the quality has been consistent for the past 4 years. My main qualm with how the place has grown, is the less social chefs and the random mess of new addition and changes to the menu. There seem to be new sushi rolls with no organization between them, mixing flavors that patrons would only eat on a dare, and having two items that are identical with completely different names. Hara sushi should focus on establishing their menu, rather than changing the name and style of the Wilshire Roll 3 times.</text>

The sushi rolls were below standard in many ways:

The rice was tough, almost felt undercooked.

The fish was chewy and did not taste fresh.

The flavor combinations were the sole bright spot with a few rolls - but this is easily achieved by anyone with the use of spicy mayo and eel sauce... so that's not much of a compliment.

Atmosphere and presentation were severely lacking (which wouldn't matter had the food been good, but it wasn't, so at least give me something to enjoy!)...

Overall, a terrible experience. I would not recommend.< /text>

<text>Most importantly, the food is fresh, does not smell.
The staff is welcoming but seemed restless since they did not have much to do, they talked a lot with eachother and we did not get attention as much as needed. The food was ok but too big pieces of fish. The grocery store sushi is better and better tasting.<//text>< date>

I would rate this place 3 stars due to it's rude waiters, but give it a 4 due to the quality food at good prices in a no frills atmosphere that is conveniently located. The quality isn't exceptional, nor are the prices, but in my opinion this is one of the best value sushi joints on the west side of the 405. Wouldn't take a date, but makes a great business lunch or chill night with the gal.</Review>

Excellent omakase; authentic sushi. Lunch special is excellent value. Wasabi appears to be handmade and was a highlight of each bite, though I don't want to understate the quality of the fish and rice. But many restaurants skimp on the wasabi when it is an essential part of eating sushi.< /Text>

Some nights are noisy and packed, others you could have the bar to yourself. Over the years I just haven't been able to figure out a trend, other than weeekends are busy, of course. I'm less impressed by hara than I used to be, but it's still a decent spot.</Review>< pictures>

It has been one of my favorite sushi places in santa monica. The prices are good but the parking kinda sucks. I had the Wilshire roll! Loved it! Also try the baked salmon roll. Service was fast, we got out food within 10 mins at most and it was a full house. Highly recommended this place. Been goin for years.< /Review>

I sat there watching it all get cold waiting for my companion's sushi to come 10 minutes later. I complained and the "manager" mumbled some excuses for the kitchen vs. sushi chef and did nothing but manage a curt "sorry" as he walked away. No wonder there was such a long line at the door.

And the rules! More rules (on the door, on the menu, on the walls) than Catholic school! Must be owned and run by lunatics.</Review><Date>1483843610941</Date>< Name>

Good, not great, cheap sushi. This place is very affordable. Despite the low prices, the sushi is not suspect. The Sashimi, hand rolls and cut rolls have always been fresh. The hot sake is also cheap and good. This is a great place to go when you need a sushi fix. Since the remodel, it is much nicer with expanded seating. Service has always been quick and reliable. They are also great for takeout. I highly recommend the Ginza Roll with spicy tuna, avocado, jalapeno and soy mustard sauce.< /Text>

<Text>My favorite sushi destination. My wife and daughter love it too. When ever we try other sushi location, we say we should have gone to Hara. Fast service, fresh sushi, friendly staff. Cash payment get's you 5% discount. They will meet all your needs and custom make your sushi or rolls.< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2bb5caa59bb39:0x1e291f4624e6ce63</gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

As Hara is just a block from my apartment, you can believe that my roommates and I got there quite a bit. The biggest draw is the price: you get pretty good sushi for a low price, not to mention good, LARGE, Japanese beers.

I definitely recommend Hara for a fun happy hour experience, and (bonus) the deals aren't limited to certain hours of the day. The hand rolls are the way to go: lots of fish in a neatly wrapped package. Their specialty rolls are also yummy, especially the caterpillar. Also, big bonus points for the included miso soups with food orders.

The service is always prompt, but there can be a wait at peak hours (5-8). Don't forget to bring cash for a 10% discount!< /Review>

Excellent little sushi spot on Wilshire with good food, good saki and great prices.  A popular place, the atmosphere is casual and the food comes out unbelievably quick.  The rolls were excellent and the fish was certainly fresh.  The saki was also very good and reasonably priced.  In fact, the entire meal was much cheaper than expected.  Great spot for a casual date or to satisfy a sushi craving.<//Review>

<review>This is a cross between a diner and a second rate sushi bar. They serve you in plastic cups and plates. Nothing particularly authentic. They put Mayo on your sushi etc. The only decent thing they have is a seaweed salad. And when you don't have miso soup because your "soup machine" is broken you should post a sign at the door. Miso soup is an important part of the meal. So over all below mediacore.<//review>< Pics>

Just a couple notches bellow the quality of hara suhsi, this is more value based sushi place. That said its much higher quality than sushi stop and just slightly more expensive. I generally stick to salmon here because it is always super fresh, they move a lot of people here and for good reason their price point with their level of quality makes it the best value in town for sushi.<//Text>

Food is decent. Waitstaff is either a non-responsive or unfriendly and the place gets super crowded. But if you don't have to wait, it's a good spot. Prices are awesome.< /review>

Affordable sushi that's done right. Good beer specials. College crowd and can get packed quickly. Parking is a bit problematic in this area.</text>

Outstanding food at great prices. Loses a star for staff attitude, usually rude and acts like you are an interruption. Food makes up for it, and chefs are very pleasant and outgoing.</Review>

<Text>I'm addicted!

I really love coming here to have some sushi and Saporro. The prices are great and the sushi rolls I always get are delicious.

I've tried different rolls, but over time I only order two of my favorite ones to share. The Lighthouse Roll and the Wilshire Roll.

The Lighthouse Roll is yummy and unique. It has a citrus lime taste that I absolutely love!!!
The Wilshire Roll is similar to a baby lobster roll at other restaurants. I like it because its good and filling.
I highly recommend both of these if you are undecided. They will not let you down.

The beers are cheap. My favorite is a Saporro and it goes perfect with the sushi rolls.

I love that everyone always starts off with Miso soup and ends with complimentary green tea ice cream. I leave a happy customer every time.

Hara can get very loud at night with tons of customers coming in and out. Sometimes you'll have to wait to be seated but its worth it. I personally love the atmosphere and young faces. Customer service is pretty good too.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

This is often a loud spot, as it's hip with the UCLA/under 30s crowd, but has with a pretty wide selection of rolls, a lot of them are either initiation crab, tempura, or tuna based on the inside. The tuna sashimi is quite good, and I love their seaweed salad. Rolls are just fun and interesting, I would not take a sushi conesiuer/snob here though - go down the street for that. Not very gluten-free unless you ask for no sauce/real crab, or be very picky on the menu. If you order enough food and drink, the miso soup and green tea ice cream are often free.<//text><date>1486826557431</date><gmapID>0x80c2bb5caa59bb39:0x1e291f4624e6ce63<//gmapID>< Name>

<Review>My husband and I are in santa monica for one night, before we fly out to Tahiti tomorrow. We both had a craving for sushi, seeing as their is a sushi restaurant on almost every corner in the LA area. I researched and read reviews,and looked for a place that would stay open past 9pm. We chose hara and I am so so glad we did! The BEST sushi/sashimi I've had in a long time. My fav is salmon and yellowtail, which were both incredibly fresh and prepared just right.. but we had 2 kinds of tuna as well,which were also perfect.
The rolls were great also! I suggest the terminator. We both loved every single thing we ordered! And the price is much more affordable than our regular spots in dallas/fortworth. The service was on point, the food came out incredibly fast,and the manager even came over to make sure we were satisfied before we left. When we return to LA, we will forever make time to go eat at hara again. Thanks to everyone there. This was our first dinner together as a married couple and it was amazing.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

(Translated by Google) It is not so delicious. There is a lot of roll menus, but most are spicy mayonnaise or salmon sauce. As Japanese people resist the taste of them, so I went to Philadelphia Roll, handful of scallops, miso soup and hot tea.
The Philadelphia roll is fair and the grip does not feel the scallop fresh. Miso soup is not thin and delicious because it has no stock. I had tea there too.
Total $ 16,43 plus chips
I wonder if it will come again.

あんまり美味しくないです。ロールのメニューがたくさんありますが、ほとんどがスパイシーマヨネーズか鰻ソースです。日本人としてそれらの味には抵抗があるので、無難にフィラデルフィアロール、ホタテの握り、味噌汁、あと温かいお茶を頼みました。
フィラデルフィアロールはまずまずで、握りはホタテが新鮮な感じがしない。味噌汁は出汁が入っていなく薄く美味しくありません。お茶もそこそこでした。
合計16,43ドルプラスチップ
もう来ないかな。

Posh Pawn is wonderful. I purchased a professional saxophone from them that plays amazing and looks spectacular. I will be purchasing more items from them this year.  The representative that worked with me is named David and he was great to work with.  The saxophone was packaged up very well and arrived in perfect condition.  Posh Pawn is first class and very professional and I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for that special gift or one of a kind item.  Thanks again David for selling me the best professional saxophone that I have ever had!  100% positive feedback from me. I will be playing next week at a big event next week in Medford Oregon.< /text>

<Text>I shop at Posh Pawn regularly and love their level of service and expertise. I recently sent some jewelry to them to repair and just received it back. The work was phenomenal!! The pieces shine beautifully as Posh Pawn cleaned and polished everything without me even asking!!!
Awesome service, great staff and a tremendous place to visit if you’re looking for amazing jewelry at fantastic prices!!!<//Text>< date>

This year has been an up hill battle. Being humbled by losing our Buisness we had to relocate our family closer to my family for support. In my time of need I had to pond some of my things to make ends meet. I was embarrassed and distraught that I even had to do this .
When I went to Posh Pond we were warmly welcomed with professional , honest and fair service. I thought I would have been judged or taken advantage of but instead I received emotional support and they tried to help me the best they could. I highly recommend this Buisness !!! If your feeling low when you come in , when you come out you feel and see a bit more light.
Thank you Posh Pond
All my best

I absolutely love this place and the people who work there! It’s all about trust, and when I was in a rough spot, the team at Posh Pawn reassured me that my valuables would be safe and secure while I used my loan to help my family.
Safe, secure, and trustworthy!
I would recommend them to anyone in need of a professional assessment of your valuables, looking for a great Louis Vuitton handbag, jewelry, or just need a loan, Posh Pawn is your friend indeed!<//Text>

Posh Pawn is the best pawn shop is San Diego. Hands down! Actually, it's the best pawn shop I ever been, for that matter. It's so nice inside, great atmosphere, feels very safe and secure inside the store. Definitely has a fancy feeling to it, and the best part: the prices are incredible! You can't beat buying a secondhand product anywhere else. You can also buy anything online with super fast shipping. They always have an awesome stock of luxury handbags and jewelry. I highly recommend Posh Pawn to anyone.< /review>

I highly recommend using Posh Pawn whether you are in the market to buy, sell, or need a quick loan on jewelry or handbags! I am a repeat customer and plan on doing business with Posh Pawn again. The staff does a wonderful job of making your experience pleasant and the service is always genuine. When you walk in you’ll notice how clean and comfortable the shop is kept. You don’t feel like you’re in a pawn shop at all! Their merchandise is always changing and they always have highly sought after brands! You won’t be disappointed! :)</Review>

<review>Posh Pawn is a local pawn shop here in Clairemont. It sits in the corner of Genesee and Clairemont Mesa Blvd. I love this Pawn shop! I love the people who work there and the owner of the store. They have great deals! I have purchased some Louis Vuitton bags and have great jewelry selections. If I am not shopping in the store, I am shopping online. I love working with Kendi. She is my go to gal, always greets me with her great big smile! I also recommend one of my cousin who traveled from Temecula just to shop at this store. She walked out with four great deals! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<//review>< date>

I have pawned several purses with Posh Pawn. Every time I come in, it doesn’t matter who’s helping me I am always treated very nicely. They always try to work with me which a lot of pawn shops don’t. They really seem to genuinely want to help. This is the only Pawn Shop I go to now & they have great stuff. Next time I need a purse I’ll be going there 1st before the Louie or Gucci store</text>

I initially went to Posh Pawn to have my watch batteries replaced. The store and staff are very inviting. So, I returned when I had some items that I wanted to sell. Kendi was of great help, professional and kind. I was given a fair price for the items I sold. I will definitely be a return customer!
I also had a necklace repaired. The jeweler did a great job and made my necklace look like new!!<//Text>

Incredibly good service from the entire staff at Posh Pawn. They really were phenomenal in the way they were able to custom build exactly what we wanted and with a terrific price that we were delighted with.
They have incredible inventory plus with their own jewelry designers in-house, they are able to create beautiful designs at great prices.
If I could give them 6 stars, I would!!!</Text>

<text>My fiance and I didn't want to go to a mall to find our rings.  We visited antique stores and were in the right track, when he mentioned pawn shops. I pulled up Posh Pawn on a quick search and knew it was a sign, because I had lived just down the street in years past.  Walking in, we were greeted warmly and with respect by Paola.  She never pushed, but patiently pulled out a variety of rings for us to try (and there were several to choose from!).  Easy as pie, we chose our rings, and I had my ring sized and back with us in about a week!  My fiance's fit him perfectly!  We are grateful for our upcoming blessed marriage, and grateful to Posh Pawn for being a vital part of the experience.  Thank you!!!!< /text><name>Deb DiMaggio< /name><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

They are the most generous and understanding people I’ve come across in a while. Taking something to a pawn shop can be embassarring at most, but they make you feel amazing. Always a smile and welcoming greeting. Times are hard , but knowing that you can get fast cash with items you may not need is a blessing. Thank you Posh Pawn< /text>

<Review>Posh Pawn really represents the benchmark of customer service. It  doesn't matter if you are in the market to buy, sell or pawn they will by far give you the best and fairest price. Their customer service is on a league of its own, specially when you deal with Paola, she is extremely knowledgeable and sincerely cares about her clients. She makes the process smooth and painless.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc008afe5f23ed:0xea40a55b75148dc9<//gmapID></record>

I must give Posh Pawn a five star review. When I first visited Posh Pawn the staff and owners were outstanding. They assisted me in an estate sale for my mother. Not only did they offer me the best price for every piece of jewelry but they went above and beyond the call of duty. I had never used a pawn shop before but I was so impressed that I went back to purchase several beautiful rings and necklaces as well as some purses.  I would highly recommend this store for any business dealings.<//Text>

It's not very often that you see a place with such great online reviews, but let me just say that Posh Pawn totally lives up to them!  The store has a nice atmosphere that is very welcoming and comfortable. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful. I would definitely recommend coming here first if you are looking for a unique gift for someone. The jewelry selection is amazing and very reasonably priced. I will be stopping in here frequently to check out what's new!</review>

I highly highly recommend this shop. I’ve had Paola assist me every time and she is the most courteous and honest person. I’ve recommend so many friends here and they’ve all had the same wonderful warm experience. So this is what this wonderful pawn shop aptly named Posh Pawn does. They authenticate all my Louis Vuitton bags that I’ve purchased preowned. They provide me with an Authenticity Certificate along with a peace of mind that the bag I bought is Authentic and not a Replica. Any lady that has any nagging doubts about a bag, watch, or jewelry. Put those doubts to rest and go see Paola at Posh Pawn. While you’re there, browse the beautiful selections. They carry a variety of Authentic designer bags for very reasonable prices! I’m a truly happy client that will be back and recommend to all my friends! 😁👍</Review>

The owners and staff members are 2nd to none and since day one, have always taken excellent care of me. The work climate there seems very pleasant and the store is always clean.  The staff members have nicknamed me Cuba Gooding Jr. due to a slight resemblance but I guess I don't have Cuba's bankroll or else, I wouldn't be in the pawn shop.😂😎  Seriously though, this place is a must visit if your in a slight bind and need a few bucks to get through.  The merchandise they have on hand is top quality and well presented.  It is truly a wonderful place to do business at and I highly recommend their store.</Review>

I absolutely LOVE Posh Pawn!  It’s unlike any other Pawn Shop I’ve been to.  Paola & David are very knowledgeable and made the shopping experience feel more like Nordstrom’s than a Pawn Shop.  The best part is I scored an amazing deal on a Louis Vuitton purse I’ve always wanted!!<//review>

<Text>Great place and people. David, Paola and their  staff are very understanding and are very easy  to work with. I have done business with them several times in times of need and they are more than fair treating me and my family like freinds rather than just another opportunity for a buck. Not only have I used them for my pawn needs but my family hss used them for nice gifts and are always given a fair price.  Above all my little girl loves going in and talking about anything because they treat her like a princess. They are very good people with a good heart and for that I wont go anywhere else< /Text>< pics>

I would like everyone to know that I receive the best customer service every time I shop at Posh Pawn. The owners are the friendliest and honest people there could possibly be at any shop. I continue to shop there and I feel  so comfortable knowing that I am getting a very good deal. Now a days it's hard to get good customer service. Thank you Nellie< /text>

The quality of the merchandise at Posh Pawn is amazing, and I doubt you'll find better or deal with a better staff than here!

<Text>Incredible service here! I was looking for a DSLR camera primarily to photograph my artwork and was impressed by David's grounded knowledge in cameras. I ended up buying a Canon EOS-1 Ds Mark iii and knew it was the best investment I could make with the price I paid for. David even provided a camera bag and a strap for no charge. I'll definitely come back for other unique items they may have in store. I appreciate being well-informed about my purchases and knowing that David and Paola will go beyond to assist me in other ways.</Text>< GmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Paola and David’s customer service is unrivaled in this particular industry! Most pawn shops come off as you needed them like you’re in a financial bind ... try to take advantage of the situation they assume you’re currently in ... not these guys! They treat me like family and I thought I was special but they treat everyone like that! And that’s why I’ll never go anywhere else! NTM they have AUTHENTIC Fendi, Gucci, Chanel, Prada ... anything your little materialistic heart desires!< /text><Date>1543290326798<//Date><gmap_id>0x80dc008afe5f23ed:0xea40a55b75148dc9< /gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

In a league of their own, bar none!

Nothing about this establishment says, pawn shop. I was referred to this location when, and if, I was interested in selling any of my 1oz gold coins or intrigued to obtaining some new ones. Upon entering and soaking it in, I felt as if I was inside a upscale boutique (Chanel) inside Nordstrom at South Coast Plaza mall. Made me scratch my head and check that I was in the right store. 🤔

Fine jewelry, high end watches (ie: Chopard), unique diamond pieces, rare collectables and the back wall dripping from top to bottom in high end designer handbags and men's wallets from LV. In addition, Posh Pawn utilizes a handheld device developed by Entrupy, Inc. that microscopically detects the convincing fakes out there, from the 100% authentic. Very cool!

Overall, beautiful merchandise in nearly mint condition! LV messenger bag with proof of purchase, as if the owner didn't even use it after spending close to $3k! 😮

Btw... April, Thomas, Kermit the Frog and the Habib guy... Don't know what they're on but they need to know that drugs are bad! If they weren't on them, they would see more clearly!

Paola (I think that was her name) effortlessly oozes professionalism and class.

I will make another visit after leaving NYC for the holidays.
San Diego is lucky to have them (Pugsie would agree). Posh indeed!< /review>

(Translated by Google) I have visited this shop a few times, but the staff are friendly and they are polite and tidy. It is a reliable shop. There are also various items on sale at cheap prices in the shop, how about going on a trip once? I think that you can be satisfied ^ _ ^

(Original)

I have lived here for 1 year, poor and rushed decision and I would avoid this building at all costs. So many better quality / location /cheaper options out there.

The main issues are as detailed, fire alarms constantly going off, both in the unit and in the building its self. Because of the frequency of this, the residence don't take them seriously representing a huge health risk.

There have been multiple break-ins in the garage with car windows smashed and the glass just left on the floor for weeks and even very recent issues with actually employees speeding through the garage putting the safety of other residents at risk, I have also had to report homeless people in the building to security x3 in the last year as gates are often left unlocked, very concerning for anyone with a family.

The back of the unit near the fire lane, constantly has trash left out in the dumpsters which in the summer sun quickly start to smell very very bad.

The Elevators all have expired permits, some over 1 year.

Over all this has been a truly disappointing place to call home. The number of students of UCI that live in the building is extremely high and that is not the community we were looking for, on top of all these serious issues.

Please think twice about living here. A home is meant to be a place to relax and this is not it.<//text>

However, the problem is the official service is not good. When I try to schedule an appointment for a studio with a budget around 1900, but he/she directly provides the plan with 2000, so I have to continue scheduling an appointment next week for a better plan. After finding a good plan  (though the location is not good),  the staff told me everything before move-in, and we thought everything is done, we can begin to pay a deposit and sign the leasing document, he then replies that the plan has already been leased. what hell is that? I spend valuable time trying to find a better room plan, but he just makes me a joke?  but anyway, I really appreciate he/she to give me time to find another good place to live.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Avoid this Irvine apartment complex at all cost! I'm a current resident, have been for 15 months, will not be renewing again. We have experienced the following since we have moved in:

- exploding appliances
- lightbulbs falling from the ceiling
- drawers and cabinets falling
- overflowing trash facilities and disgusting odors in the hallways
- upper floors are more humid than a Florida swamp during summer months
- staff using public drinking fountains to fill buckets used to clean toilets (first floor bathroom by the pool)
- Hallway entrances smelling of animal urine and feces
- Disrespectful residents that party loudly and make noise all night.
- fire alarms consistently going off, which has caused multiple residents with noise sensitivity issues a great deal of harm, including people in our family.
- packages stolen A LOT

from other reviews here on Google:

Car break ins
Weak security
Surprise charges
Intimidating to live here with aggressive residents
Intentional manipulation of residents by management

As far as management goes, they go out of their way to distance themselves from the problems their community faces. I have spoken with several residences that are fed up with the quality of maintenance and management, which has gotten much worse since COVID, but they can't afford the lease break penalty.

Some of the issues are:

- disregarded work orders and maintenance requests
- selective enforcement of policies (i.e. special treatment being given to certain residences who have romantic relationships with people in management)

See pictures attached for an example of what a normal day looks like in the hallways of the Residences on Jamboree.

For what you are paying to live here, do yourself a favor and find somewhere else. You will NOT be happy with your decision to move in here. You will not see the problems until you have already moved in. I've lived in multiple apartments in my life and this has been the worst experience by far.

Working right now to get out of my lease.< /Text>

HIDDEN FEES AND CHARGES:
Be very mindful with this property, they have a very helpful team, however that’s more than what can be said for the company itself. We’ve have over 3 errors or mis matching prices before we’ve moved in, and the only response is “UDR Is very strict”

MOLD & MILDEW:

UDR is aware of this issue and refused to address it nor fix it. They will say it’s a part constraint however the manufacture will deny this claim and provide you the part upon request within 3-5 business days......the real reason? Staffing, because they don’t have someone to order the part we are not stuck with the previous tenants moldy appliance.

HARDWOOD FLOORS MISSING:
These floors are cheap, and missing several planks of wood. Cheap contractors at high price is what you’ll find here.

It’s a shame because the maintenance staff is very polite and nice, however UDR as a whole clearly doesn’t care about their teams safety, their tenant safety, or property.

VANDALISM:
First day we moved in, our front door was vandalized. Our neighbors have had it happen repeatedly and they don’t care. I’m sure they’ll attempt to charge us at the end for this.<//Text>

Fire alarms is running randomly.

Sometimes once a week, AM times, PM times. It’s just unacceptable. Absolutely error in the system. But, this is what leasing staffs and management will say: “it’s a non-smoking community and sometimes residents smoke in their apartments”.

Come on!!!!

Most of apartments in Irvine are non-smoking community and I’ve never had this experience in any apartments. Even my friends who are living in different apartments in Irvine were shocked when I ask them if they are having the same issue !

This is the fact, we don’t even know when the fire alarm is running because of REAL fire. If that’s the case, lots of residents will be in trouble.

PLEASE do not reply with just being sorry.

PLEASEEEEE FIX THIS ISSUE.

Thank you< /text>

Car Wheels got stolen in the garage because of the garage gate was constantly left open at night. The company was not willing to take responsibility for the victims nor installing security cameras to prevent future incidents.

I am now terrified to live here thinking of me waking up one day and my car wheels were gone...<//text>

We moved in late July. Here’s a tally of how often the fire alarms have gone off (I’m sure there have been more when I wasn’t home). They usually go on for 10-15 minutes:
1) 8/16/19 - time unknown

<Review>Pros:
- Management/Maintenance teams are responsive and pleasant.
- Building itself is generally nice.

Cons:
- Fire alarm goes off constantly, most often in the middle of the night.  I've lived here 20 weeks and there have been at a minimum 19 fire alarms that I've counted (not to mention more I'm sure I've missed).  Not only is this an extreme inconvenience and annoyance, it's also potentially really dangerous in the event of an actual fire.
- Tenants are incredibly dirty.  Garbage is constantly overflowing in the garbage room.  Dog poop and urine in the hallways and stairwells on a daily basis.
- Parking lot security is weak.  Guests will follow you in through the lot to avoid security on a daily basis.  Have seen broken glass multiple times.
- Very few sponsored events.  Rooftop is often rented out to third parties.  If you're looking for a place to meet new people, this is probably not the best spot.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1580761655592, 'text': "Hi Jack,\n\nThank you for your review, we appreciate your feedback. The fire alarms sound in the entire community when any smoke is in the area, the community is 100% non-smoking, so any smoke of any kind will set these alarms off. Management implements the non-smoking policy to all residents and have posted signs in all the elevators informing all of this policy as well as signs along the community. We take this very seriously and send violations notices to anyone that is not complying with community policy.\n\nThe maintenance team walks to trash rooms several times a day to ensure they are working properly and no trash is left outside. If the compactor is left open on one floor it will disable all the other floors as a safety precaution. Please contact the leasing office if you ever come across the shoots being out of service or overfilled and we will take care of this.\n\nThe amenities are available for reservation and a first come first serve basis.

<username>Michael Woodring</username><review>This building is full of amenities from the sky deck for parties to the courteous and helpful leasing staff.  Always a smile and a cheerful greeting when you see them.  Andre who coordinates the efforts of the maintenance team never fails to get things corrected the same day as reported.  They all remember your name.  I would highly recommend giving this place a shot when looking for a classy place to live.

Guys, they charge for everything in a rather excess fashion. The lockout fee, if you forget to bring your key with you, of $200 is probably industry leading. Oh and you pay for parking, mailbox, etc. So beware before you sign.<//Review>

Horrible place! Read the other reviews! Staff here is trained to manipulate potential residents, they hide hundreds of dollars worth of fees, refuse to reimburse me for my down payment after I caught on to what they were doing. They are super disorganized and half the time can't answer basic questions, such as, how is parking? Do your homework before moving in here.< /Review>

<Text>Do NOT put your phone number on any of their forms if you’re looking here. They will harass you via calls and text messages that you will not have opted into(which is illegal). Give a fake phone number. I’ve asked to be removed from their contact list and they continue to contact me.

I got a tour here, it was great except it seemed like they were up selling me for things that I did not need. Also, they charge a $25 registration + $5/month to use their mailbox package system. So you will not be allowed to receive packages if you don’t opt into this. That is absurd and they might as well make it free like all of the other complexes around the area and just increase the rent. I was quite disappointed on how nice the place actually is but how badly it was represented by the staff and nickel-and-diming their operations is here.<//Text>< pics>

Coffee machine is often empty or not working, hot tub sometimes is cold and not working as well. I do love the location though it's unbeatable being in the center of orange county. Also maintanence staff are friendly, helpful and quick to respond to your needs. If working ammenities are not as important to you like they are to me, I would say this place is a win. Beautiful property but I'm hung up about my coffee and hot tub.<//text>

Great property! The rooftop area is splendid. We came for our friend's birthday party and really enjoyed the setting. Huge parking lot with tons of guest parking! Ping pong and pool tables. BBQ, fridge, sink and cooking area. Many tables and seeing areas. Giant movie screen to have cozy movie nights with friends. Nice and clean restrooms.< /Text>

Resident of 2yrs. -

Don't move here unless you enjoy not having parking (that you pay for), living with ant infestations, and inconsiderate community residents / neighbors. Also incredibly overpriced compared to cheaper, and nicer apartment options on the exact same street.

Irvine Company is known for raising their rent on long-term residents ON TOP of the already expensive price. Try to avoid them.

If anything breaks, putting a request in via the community portal is useless, they don't check it. Ever.

Due to water damage complications from poor construction, we've lived in three separate units on this property. All of which have had the same issues. Ants, inattentive staff, and dirty communal areas. The only current staff that have been helpful are the maintenance guys, but they can't help you unless the other staff alert them of the issues (which doesn't occur).

Absolutely, do not move here.< /review>

My boyfriend lives here. The room, facilities and environment are pretty good. However!!!! The freaking deafening terrible fire alarm goes off randomly,wakes you up sometimes in the early morning, sometimes around like 3-5 am.
The room it-selves fire alarm is too sensitive, every time , I mean every single time, as long as I make steaks, it will go off.

<text>1)My boyfriend’s car wheels were stolen, the staff who works in the leasing office did not give a damn about what we had experienced. The only thing they care about is when we will put the wheels back on so they wouldn’t get more complaints from other residences or people who about to move in here.
2) My friends and I were stuck in the elevator once, not only that the elevator was droped from the second floor to the first floor. Thank God we were all fine. It took over 30 minutes for the fire department to come and solve the problem. The elevator always stops working, be prepared of that if you want to move in:)<//text>< pics>

Worse experience of my life! I have never been so offended or felt discriminated by a company (like ever) I applied for their moderate income program and had 2 cosigners (mind you my income is okay) and the 3 of us weren't able to get approved like come on? It's a studio for 1500$ and I pay 1700$ now (Complete disappointment) and waist of time. The only reason I was going to settle was because I wanted to save the extra 200$ to do whatever. Thank God for the Irvine Company!! Great customer service and appreciate my business.</text>

< Review>
We lived here for almost a year, and would not recommend this place to anyone to move in. The staff there does not seem to care about the residents:

1) No assigned parking, and we could never find parking spot. Because of this, we sold one of our cars. If you like to have your own parking spot, it will cost you $100 for reserving a parking spot. (We searched for several apartments, it usually comes with a parking space close to the residence.) This is the only place that does not come with a parking spot. We ever saw one car with no wheels, because the tires were all stolen. Wow!

2) Fire alarm constantly went off, and it is very annoying to all the residents. The only explanation was the alarm system malfunctioned in some ways, but still the fire alarm kept going off for months. It even happened during mid night around 2-3 am, and lasted for about 30 min or longer. The staff just said that some residents smoked inside of their place, which caused the fire alarm to go off. So nothing much they can do to fix this issue. Does that mean we are paying the rent for some people to cause the fire alarm to go off to ruin our sleep? If you have a baby, this is a big no no.

3) We requested for window screen installation several times and it took about 4 months to get it done. I am pretty sure that the apartment has a lot of requests for window installation.
In addition to that, the service staff entered our apartment without having us on site. What if something valuable is missing, who will be responsible for it?

4) Trash room is always a mess, and you can never open the door for dumping. Also, every other day, the trash truck made so much noise (back up sound), and it gets annoying during the day.

5) There’s always people talking loudly after mid night, we can barely sleep with such high noises. Even we have security on site, no use at all.

We tried to get these issues resolved, however the staff made us feel like it was our own problem. Just because we already signed the leasing contract, there’s nothing they can do. We just want them to fix  the problem, but the problems are always there. I know every apartment has its problems, but they always try to fix it. Apparently not this apartment.

If you wish find a pleasant home, please make sure that your rent is worth the buck. This place is highly not recommended, or you will regret for life. (This apartment is a mess, don’t get carried away with the nice amenities - nice rooftop, gym - machines always broken, coffee machine- 90% of time not working). Be wise on your choice since there’s a lot of options out there. I hope this review helps anyone who is looking for an apartment, unlike us stuck with it for one whole year.</Review>

The apartments here are very nice and have more of a hotel feel than an apartment feel. The pool area in the center of the apartment complex has a nice grilling area, Bluetooth cabanas, and beautiful glass firepits surrounding the hot tub and pool. The lounge area on the roof is a great reading and hangout space. The large outdoor TV provides for a quaint outdoor theater for you and some friends.< /Review>

One of the worst places ever lived in especially if you have a car cause the garage is super insecure, my tires got stabbed and that happened to a bunch of residents but leasing office never really get hands on these problems. However, fees kept increasing and you don’t get the service that matches the price.</Review>

They need cameras in the hallways and parking structure so they can figure who keeps setting off the fire alarm and EVICT THEM. Also why would the engineer/project manager who built this place allow dogs but put carpet in the hallways the place smells like dog piss now, good one. It's about almost 5:30am here, it's Saturday, I'm awake because I was awoken by the false fire alarm that went off at 5am and lasted about 10 mins long. The sound is so loud it literally blows your eardrums up! I will not be renewing once my lease is up! I want out already!</review>< Pictures>

worse place I ever lived,
ants everywhere, insecure, and guest parking at six floor, very inconvenient.
if you gonna move in here, get ready to lose your car's wheels, or get your car scratched
no camera in parking garage, multiple theft and damage to vehicles happened, and leasing office does not care, always reply "working on it".</Text>

< review>
Pros: Wonderful building with fantastic amenities and management that is continuously working on improvements of overall experience. Cons: community - residents are predominantly loud, untidy, irresponsible with usage of pets designated area but these aspects are not reducing the overall experience we have in the building!  Strong recommendation!</review>

(Translated by Google) You can’t sleep with this stupid fire alarm. This fire alarm is really stupid and can bother you to stay away from this.

{'time': 1557516110345, 'text': "Hello Yu,\n\nI apologize for the fire alarm noise. We wanted to contact you, but based on your screen name we’re having difficulties finding you in our records. Our team has been working diligently to address the fire alarm. The alarms are sensitive and sadly recently went off because someone was smoking a cigarette when they shouldn't have as it is completely against our non-smoking policy. We are working closely with our team and communicating with residents to ensure that every effort is made to prevent the alarms from falsely sounding off and to stop people from smoking. We appreciate your feedback.\n\nBest regards,\nJody Conley\n720-348-7620\nWeCare@udr.com"}<//Resp>

<Text>Anthony was awesome! I'm a real estate photographer and my photo computer crashed. I was in a panic. I called multiple stores (Best Buy, Staples, Walmart, Target and some Computer repair guys) nobody answered. I called office Depot in La Quinta and Anthony answered, he was extremely helpful and I ended up purchasing a new HP. I will be going there from now on! Thank you!< /Text>< username>

<Text>Rewards program now very sketchy. You used to(1) bring in your empty cartrages (2) get notified by email that your rewards were ready, (3) print your reward coupon, and of course (4) use it to buy more ink or whatever.   Now you bring in cartrages and you have to wonder afterwards! A good program was messed up!!!😔<//Text>< user_name>

<Review>I love that social media pop up asked me about my experience at Office Max. Well let me tell you..  they might as well close the Last Quinta store! We went in for a nice pen for a gift. The website says they are in stock. When we got there we finally found one of the two or three people working there. We brought up 3 empty boxes of the pens we liked. The girl scanned them and told us only one was actually in stock. She went to find it. After about 10 minutes she returned and told us they do not have it. Then she proceeded to explain they have personnel issues and the pens are possibly on the truck on one of the seven pallets. So we ask when they are going to be available...she tells is in about a WEEK! It's going to take them a WEEK to unload the truck!  With management/service like this you might as well close down all the brick and mortar! USELESS!!! Get a new manager!<//Review>< Pics>

The cashier was very nice. I wasn't feeling well, so sad in a rolling chair, no one cared.  I've gone into a bigger store and was going to buy a chair but the employees attitude told  me "get off!" I'll definitely shop there again!!!</text>

Well I go to this store often and they treat u “ok” when your all dressed badly. Except of the blond women, she’s always very nice. So always go well dressed people, not with your working construction work lol PS. They don’t often know what they sell, so it’s better to take an extra look around the store.</Review>

While they shopped, I browsed for a new "All-in-one" printer I've been thinking of purchasing.  Received thorough explanation of several models, and all my questions were answered.  Were we not now living 80 miles away from this store, I would certainly make my purchase at the La Quinta store.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I've ordered several print jobs from this location, and quality has always been poor (black prints often faded).  I attempted to try again, and will never place another order with them.
I was given a completion date, and an email stating that the job was ready for pick up.  When I arrived, I was told the order could not be located.  I phoned the 800 number provided on the order, and was told it would be a week before the prints would be available.
The icing on the cake was the treatment I was given, when I asked for help to obtain the prints when they were finally completed.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I needed a drum for my MFC Brother printer in my office. My office can not function or conduct business with out a printer! I came to this Office Max and an associate at the counter told me they DO NOT CARRY drums IN-STORE, it has to be ordered online!!!!!!! I then searched Office Depot, called and the associate that answered helped me immediately and placed the drum on hold for me. I will never come back this place or any OfficeMax again.< /Text>

Horrible customer service here . I wish they understood how stressful back to school shopping is on its own ... And the fact that everything I picked up was labeled as 1¢ ..but the cashier wanted to argue with me about the price. No wonder Wal-Mart is everyone's go to place . I don't think 1 star is deserved, I just have to put one .<//text>

Quite possible the worst store / customer service in the area.  I avoid them at all cost.  The print center is manifestly incompetent.  I need work done well - not apologies.  They lose files, print old files and cant manage to reprint a receipt that they lost.  AVOID this place.</Text>

My new regular nail place.  did my design exactly how i envisioned and even suggested a color that made it better. The pricing is great compared to other places. They’re very nice here, Definitely coming back.< /Review>

My mom and I went here today it’s my second time We both got pedis & i came to fix my gel polish on my fingers because i had gone to another nail place and they did them terribly. We both loved our pedis on the other hand the gel on my finger nails sucked i believe it was the owner who did them. She was in to much of a rush all of the edges are missing paint they still have orange from my previous mani and she got top coat on the side of some of my fingers. Now i know who not to go to, again I loved my pedi and i will only be back for the lady who did my pedicure but for the other one just take your time if you want clients to keep coming back! I already had a bad experience just to come here for my finger nails to look bad as well cute design though. Btw my toe nail was chipped and my pedicurist fixed it, and it looks great !<//text>

I've posted about Eagle before, but today I had another mani/pedi and I'm really happy with how things turned out.. First, I had a nail break from another spot and called last minute.. I'm a professional and a jagged nail just doesn't fly.. they fit me in even though shop was about to close.. I brought my kids and they made time for them as well.. They went above and beyond to make sure my toes got designed quickly when my kids started to fuss. My two young daughters also got mani/pedis and the staff was very tolerant and understanding and patient even as my 6 year old knocked over the COVID protection shield (d'oh).. nail design came out great as usual and my spoiled princesses are happy as well. By far my favorite nail spot! Prices are super reasonable, nails always come out good and staff is friendly. LOTS OF CHOICES AND DESIGNS ESP FOR GEL! I've been to a couple of other nail spots and just been absolutely gouged in comparison for nails that dont last nearly as long.. Eagle is the place to go!!</Review>

Gina & her beauty team of ladies are the best!. I love when I get my acrylic nails filled they make my hands look beautiful!
Thankyou ladies at Eagle Nails for making me super happy & satisfied. I wish them all the best in The New Year! 2019.
I 100% percent recommend Eagles Nails.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I always go to gina for my acrylic nails. She leaves my nails beautiful and i never experience premature lifting or falling off. my nails last a very long time.

The only downside is that the quality of work is not consistent. Gina is amazing but not all her girls are as skilled as her.

They are way cleaner than most nail salons out there and like professionals have their license on display.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2da2758a65c3d:0xaea964625449ac6f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have been going here for about 5 years now. Nothing compares to this family owned business, their warmth and very friendly atmosphere makes you feel right at home. I won't go anywhere else. Their performance in nail detail is outstanding and lasting. I recommend 'Eagle Nails' to everyone.

< Review>
Pedicures are okay. But the nail work sucks. They leave glue all over your nails, acrylic all over your cuticles, they never paint your whole nail fully or correctly. I constantly have to tell them to get the tip to prevent paint chipping. Most of the time I would loose a nail in less than a week. I go here cus it's 2 blocks from where I live. But deffenetly not comming back.< /Review>

This place is horrible. I got my lashes done and she put too much glue, she rushed it. My eyes was watery and the glue was matted. My eyelashes was hurting really bad,  I had to rub the glue off with water, it took forever. I will never come here again.</Review>

<Text>I myself is a new salon owner but I have been patronizing with them well before I even opened my own place. The ownership and the place is definitely a hidden gem in city of Moreno Valley. I must give them the well deserved credit and kudos for the phenomenal work that they do. I honestly admire and envy their work at the same time and try to emulate and apply the same standards at my salon. My next appointment for green peel treatment is at their Rancho Cucamonga location that I'm eagerly looking forward to. Thank you ART iBrow for always looking after me!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dca601c777c585:0x8f595e6a6f7684ab</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've gotten my brows done once before and they came out great. The wait was a bit long so I would suggest calling ahead, but the henna her was great!! Usually I get the run around with brow places claiming they do henna but its never available when I want to go but I was very happy with how it turned out<//text>

This place is amazing. The owner is such a sweetheart. When I first came in 1 year or so ago. I was very hesitant to try someone new. Any female would agree with me. When you have your someone to do your eyebrows you will always go to them! My old person left where I going previously and left me in search of a new eyebrow threader. I seen this new location before it even opened, again very hesitant, i went in  and she greeted me with a smile and was very welcoming. I decided to stay and try it out. When she was done I was very pleased with her work. I left over  the moon satisfied with her customer service, her genuine characteristic, and her warm welcome. The owner her sister her husband are all great and very welcoming. If your looking for a new eyebrow threader I would definitely recommend this place. You will not be disappointed. 😊</review>

Awesome place with awesome people to go to. I got my Microblading done from here and the results turned out more than satisfactory then what it was promised. Very professional, skillful, and friendly staff, not to mention the positive and relaxing ambience that this place offers that  that truly puts you at ease while getting your hair plucked . You really have to visit this place to experience it yourself.</Text>

Never coming back!! She took off half my eyebrow! Let’s just say they butchered my eyebrows bad. The girl barely greeted me and just told me to sit in the chair not even asking me how I wanted them. She didn’t wipe the hairs off my face with a tissue and kept ripping the thread. She broke my skin over my right eye and my eyebrows were totally uneven. She basically took off the entire half of my left eyebrow. There were still scattered hairs around my brows. Definitely disappointed, I just paid and walked out because I’m not one to cause drama. Save your money and go elsewhere. UPDATE: Woke up the next morning to see scabbing all around my missing brows. That girl really did a number ripping my skin.< /Review>

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! Raheela and her sister are the only ones who can do my brows perfect!! And they have such good customer service and always friendly. I literally was sad when I moved to Temecula but I still drove to Moreno Valley because I didn’t want any other place touching my eyebrows. If I can give them more than 5 stars I would !<//Text>

Reply to Owner:

I dont know who you're confusing me for but never did I go into your establishment saying that the mall refused to do my eyebrows. My eyebrows are not thin at all but after leaving your place one was much thinner than the other. So please dont address me with your false information. Had I addressed the problem there what would have happened? Not like you could've glued my brows back on. A bad job was done and that's it.</Review>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1524955494240, 'text': "Nidia,\nWe would humbly request you to please don't mislead people by leaving false and baseless reviews about us. You came straight from the eyebrow place located inside the mall and told us they refused to do your eyebrows because they were already too thin which made them reluctant to touch them. We adviced you the same after examining your brows, however, you asked us that you still want them to be cleaned up, and that's exactly what we did. If you noticed any difference in your brows after we fixed them,   it would have been immensely helpful for both of us  should you have addressed them right there and then. We have a professional and dedicated staff who are always there to provide you with solutions, not problems.\nOur expert artists are always willing to take care of your beauty related needs or address any issues or concerns you may have. Please just let us know and we will be glad to assist you further.\n\nThank you,\nART Ibrow Management-"}< /resp>< GmapID>

I have now found an eyebrow threading home. I have been to this shop before and I left very dissatisfied because I like my eyebrows thicker and they were done very thin dispight my request. However, when I came back yesterday (9/23/18) and Raheela helped me, she was kind, patient and listened to excatly what I wanted. I looked in the mirror and felt very satisfied with the outcome. She then showed me how their brow power worked and I will be back to purchase that as well.

Thank you Raheela.
I highly recommend her!!!</Text>

< Review>
My eyebrows came out perfect, not overly arched and nicely shaped. I have very sensitive skin and needed an alternative to waxing which leaves me with break outs, extreme redness, and has even taken off skin. Threading is perfect if you've had  any of these problems like me.</Review>

The business was closed on that day due to immediate family member being passed away. We did put up the note of this inside the entrance door. However, upon our return we noticed that the note had fallen off and was laying on the floor. Please come see us and we will make up for your wasted trip by offering you our special 'promo code' which includes free eyebrow.\n\nWhen you come in, please be sure to explain the associate about the incident to redeem the code.\n\nWe are here for you if you need anymore help.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSincerely,\nArt iBrow Management"}</resp>

Any time I have a plumbing problem, I call Patriot Plumbing. They always do an outstanding job and are always very professional.
This time I had a leaky water heater plus another water heater that was way past due for replacement. I also had a leaky shower valve.
When I called Patriot, they offered to come out immediately since it was the water heater (it was 6:30pm) but told them that next day would be fine, if they could do it. Got a call first thing next day and they were there at 9am with my two new water heaters and replacement shower valve. Got the job done in under two hours and did a great job of cleaning up (see attached photo).
As always, I got a job well done, great service and at a reasonable price. Thanks again, Patriot Plumbing !</text>

I needed to replace the faucet because the water line was broken and they just came and checked it told me what was wrong and left,  never called me back or anything  very unprofessional. They didn't have the decency
to call and say "hey we are sorry but we can't do the job for you"... Maybe if I was not Hispanic they would have done the job? that's  the vibe i got from the guy that came to my house..Never calling them again.  And no i don't recommend them...<//Review>

<time>1590416634019</time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I own a rentals in the Lancaster and worked as a peace officer in the Antelope Valley for a number of years. I have frequently used plumbers in the area. My experience has often been disappointing. The work has often been shoddy as in the case with Abe Lincoln Plumbing. Vendors would fail to backup their work resulting on one occasion in legal action and they were often overpriced.
Patriot plumbing was the exception. I had a drain stoppage in one of the rental properties it was around 5 pm and the tenant was panicked. When I called Patriot they informed me that they would not be able to take care of the problem until tomorrow. I explained the situation to the dispatcher and Patriot did what was necessary to accommodate my tenants needs that evening.
Patriot cleared a drain on Friday and I experienced a second storage on Monday. I explained to Patriot what had occurred and that I expected that the stoppage had not been completely cleared on Friday. There was only one middle aged adult living in the house at the time. They made no excuses and dispatched someone to take care of the problem. The work was completed in a timely manor and without an additional charge.
Patriot does good work and they back their work up.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I'm a real estate Broker and managing buildings.  The best way to discribe Patriot Plumbing is responsive, professional & honest which is hard to find now days. Had a gas leak in one of the units,  Derek answered the phone, quoted the service fee, scheduled it, his man Chris showed up found the problem and stayed within the quoted price. Amaizing service! Use them with  confidence!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

These people are outstanding!  They are professional, polite and very knowledgeable.  They arrived on time, covered the floors in the work areas and began work.  In a little less than three hours they had completed the job, cleaned up everywhere and were ready to leave.  This time included an extra half hour to fix a problem that had not been foreseen.

Larry, the owner, had previously given us a written estimate of the work to be done and said that if things went smoother than anticipated, he might be able to reduce the cost.  Imagine my surprise when he presented us with the final bill and it had been reduced by one third!  This is unheard of in my past experience with contractors of any kind.

I cannot provide greater praise than to say that I would not hesitate to use Patriot for all my future pluming requirements and to recommend them to family, friends and strangers.

Thank you Patriot Plumbing, Larry and Chris.</text>

Patriot Plumbing does excellent work and I would recommend them to anyone in need of a plumbing issue. The first time they came to my home last year, they replaced pipes and today they installed a new water heater. They work quickly and efficiently! No job seems to big for them and they know what they're doing. Thanks Patriot!< /Text>

We are owner builders and did most of the plumbing ourselves. Left the hardest portion of installing a fire box for a gas fireplace and a tankless water heater for Patriot Plumbing. Mike and John were fantastic!! Very professional, got the job done, and we're very pleased with their work. Very reasonable pricing as well.  Highly recommended!< /Review>

We had the need for an emergency water heater replacement and were given Patriot as a referral from a friend. They came the following morning to provide an estimate of what it would take to do the work, how long, and what the cost would be.The option of immediate service was available as well, but that wasn't necessary for us.
The price for the work was very reasonable, and the personnel who performed the work were very professional and friendly. The work was done within a few short hours and was very well done. They cleaned up efficiently, and explained what they were doing at all times.
We would highly recommend them to others, and will call on them for any future plumbing needs.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>When it comes to knowledgeable and professionalism, this is it! No games no gimmicks. These guys are the real deal! When they say 24 hours and 7 days a week, they mean it. I had to call for a broken line under the slab in the middle of the night which flooded my house and on a weekend night no less! The on-call technician that answered (Mike) reassured me everything would be fine and said he'd be out within the hour. Well 25 minutes later, he was at my door! Not only did he help fix the problem, but he also directed me to a water restoration company that came out to extract the water from the house. I will be recommending this company to my friends and family for any plumbing need. Thanks Patriot Plumbing :)<//Text>< pictures>

Mike and Zo came out for a service call for my sewage pipe being backed up and did an amazing job! They arrived in a timely manner, informed me of everything that they were doing beforehand, and were incredibly professional. Just based of this one service call, I know Patriot Plumbing is the only plumber I'll be calling while I still live out here in the AV!< /Text>

If you give me a service time window, be here. I skipped errands to stay at home, just to be told 10 minutes before the window closes that it'll be 30 to 60 minutes until arrival.

<Review>John came the within a few hours of my call and immediately diagnosed the problem.  He needed to come back when he had replacement equipment.  He did so at a time convenient for our family.  His prices are fair and they are an ethical company.  I would use them again!<//Review><Name>Anna Lee<//Name>< userid>

<Review>The first time I called Patroit Plumbing was when I had a flood in my Kitchen. A yound man named Larry and and his assistant arrived at my home in a timely manner. The damage caused by our flood had to be turned over to our Insurance Co. Patroit Plumbing assured me that they would do everything they could to bring our home whole again. They contacted the right people to help. I also recommended to my Insurance Co. that I would prefer to use this company for all plumbing needs to restore our home. One year later our water heater went out, called Patroit Plumbing once again. My husband was impressed by the price quoted by Patroit that it was more reasonable than other compaines. Once again Patroit came to our rescue.  We highly recommend Patroit Plumbing to our family, friends and co-workers. Friendly. clean and courteous.  Hats off Patroit, and thank you!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We have a tankless hot water heater - it worked fine for several years and then started randomly shutting off.  I had called the company who installed it, they charged me almost $500 to "clean" the unit but the problem still was not fixed.   I called another plumber who supposedly worked on tankless hot water heaters - they also tried to fix the problem by "cleaning" the unit, more money spent and still not fixed.   I was about ready to have the unit replaced and install a new unit, but AirStream Heating and Air happened to be working on my furnace - I asked them if they could recommend someone, they gave me the name of Patriot Plumbing.   Basically, Patriot came out spent a few minutes on the phone with the tankless manufacturer and discovered that the altitude had never been set correctly on the unit - set the correct altitude and presto every thing worked again as advertised.   Patriot charged me a responsible rate for fixing the problem, at about a quarter of the previous two plumbers - but the tankless water heater worked fine after they left and is still working fine several years later!   Highly recommend Patriot - they have since fixed several other plumbing issues at our house and office, each time with great service.   Can't say enough good about these folks!< /text>

<review>It took awhile to get in, but that was a good thing. It meant they were up and running. We actually tried to go to Chili's first, only to find out they closed at 4pm. They had no staff. Everyone wants to sit at home and collect free money from those of us that work for our money. Anyway, our server was very friendly, very attentive, and polite. The food was delicious, and served just the way we requested. We had friends in from out of town, and stayed longer than we maybe should have. But they didn't seem to mind, nor did they ask us to leave. Had we seen they had people waiting to be seated though, we'd have left. I hope more people will go out to these restaurants that are open. And please be sure to give them a good tip!</review>< Pictures>

<date>1583833364793</date><Rating>3</Rating><text>Although I was initially drawn by the fact they have seafood to accompany the steak. I happened to be there on a Wednesday, and there was the special walkabout Wednesday deal, which has a 5oz steak with a side and small draft beer for $10.99. Limited choice of domestic beer, more specifically, 2 choices.
Most items on the menu are priced higher than I thought it’d be; nothing special about the steak and under par with the price I see on the menu. Rather go to Red Lobster for the quality and price.< /text>< Pictures>

<Time>1616300196224<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I ordered a steak rare plus and got exactly what I asked for. Many people I go out with rather medium rare however, I'm from a place where meat cooked rare is best. As far as sea food goes. My girlfriend loved her grilled shrimp appetizer, the sauce served with it was extraordinary. Overall  i enjoyed my experience and will 100% come back again. Thank you my server Kim, and the owner Leah.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The service was very good. The food was ok. I ordered prime rib and it was a lil chewy. I ordered it outback style but I guess they don't do that anymore. The pasta with steak and shrimp was pretty good. Steak was much better than the shrimp. The restrooms were disgusting! Me and my husband both went and it was really bad. Not sure if we'll be going back anytime soon.< /review>

Best value steak in town. We shared the 9oz filet mignon between us. Baked sweet potato with a hunk of butter is delicious!

Parking is easy, the Clairemont Town Square mall has a ton of stores, so it's one destination for pretty much all the family needs.<//Text>

<Text>Tried to order and was told they are closed they turn off their grills and close the kitchen at 830 so they can close by 9. I called at 840 for two items that do not require a grill. All I wanted was soup. But was told I can't order after having had to call twice because the first time they would not answer. Extremely disappointed. Will not come here and will suggest others stay away as well.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1619206115326, 'text': "We appreciate you letting us know about your experience.

When I want a steak and I don't want to cook it myself Outback is my choice. Doesn't hurt that it is close by and I can get it to go especially in the time of the pandemic.</text>

Picked up curb side takeaway for dinner.  The food was very good flavor.  I ordered grilled chicken, Mac and Cheese, slow roasted prime rib, and pork chop dinners.  The pork chops were a little over cooked, but tasty.< /Text>

To compete with Black Angus restaurant, the Outback has steak and seafood specials that blow them away.  The steaks are noticably better quality and way more tender than at Black Angus.  The seafood is better than at Red Lobster. The servers are super friendly and eager to make suggestions.  If you are lucky your server will be Victor G.  He is the best server we've had in 10 years, not just at the Outback.  He treats you like you are at a five star gourmet restaurant.  If the Outback is smart they will promote Victor so he will be the regional trainer of all new servers, followed by managing his own restaurant.  He takes pride in his work and does his best to please you.  That's something I've never seen at a chain restaurant.< /Review>

This visit turned out to be a bad experience. First time ordering via online and won't be doing it again. In all actuality, it was a total waste of $104.00. Did a review the same night on the app as requested. It said they would respond in 24 to 48 Hours....here it is 6 days later, and no response from anyone. Just not happy with this Outback location right now and definitely not happy with Corporate at the moment. With everything going on right now, one would think that Customer Service would be a major priority, but, apparently not.<//review>

Covid precautions. This location does not have Sailor Jerry's rum 😪
Shrimp add on comes on bread now like it use to.
Waiter was nice and added some garlic butter because the shrimp looked dry. Great customer service.< /review>

I generally enjoy the food but tonight I had a large order with a 6 oz filet minion . The filet was cooked the way I like it but the meat itself had so much gristle in it that you could not even cut it. I ended up giving it to my dogs.<//review>

Awesome Sirloin Steak with Mushrooms with Chicken Tortilla Soup for ~ $25. You can't beat it! Plus I had a very friendly waitress from the midwest (Minnesota), where I've lived and worked twice over the past 5 years, which was nice. I'll be back!<//Text>

<text>Well , they just told me not to come back after 20 years of eating there , a few weeks ago i order to pick up like i do . And my food was ready just setting there but the manager and new guy thought they would go through there work schedule . Instead of giving me my food i sat there watching them for 5 mins . So i got out and knocked on the window it scared them i guess . The new guy turned around scared like and got my bag as i pointed at it . He opened the door with one arm out with bag i took it and left . And been there a few times since then . But tonight the new guy was there hearing my voice in the middle of my order he told me to hold on for some reason a long few minutes later an manager got on and told me i had an altercation there . I said never . He said well you did and you can not come back . Wow this is unbelievable because i knocked on the window.  Then i called back to talk to the manager about this . He was no help just keep saying i was at fault . Then the manager had the nerve to say i was not talking right like i was drunk.  I was very surprised by that and i  told him i had mouth surgery from cancer and it's hard to talk . I am surviving from this cancer i don't need this . And the manager hung up on me thinking i was drunk . I don't drink in the first place . What is going on people 😕< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This Outback is inconsistent in both vegetables and  steak, as well as cooking knowhow.  I was a regular until the new franchise owner took over and now I will no longer go there due to consistent problems with food, service and personnel / management not doing a satisfactory job at fixing or resolving issues. 2 specific issues are they randomly change the side order vegetables when they are too expensive for them to purchase for the store which is just unheard of in other chains of stores. Like for instance brocolli, carrots, and califlower, changed to asparagus, and then to green beans. So the menu is always wrong. They also consistently undercook steak and then want you to immediately resolve it with the chefs by sending THAT steak back to be cooked more. I understand the concept. However this is uncomfortable and embarrasing and the steak never tastes right in a second cooking. Then they argue about not charging you for unacceptable food or service after waiting 15 more minutes for your recooked steak while your entire table eats without you! And this has happened to me several times since the changeover of owners/ management. I even gotten my steak back 10 minutes later still uncooked (pic included)   Please, dont accept rude or arguementative behavior from the owner at this store. Or just dont go there.  Ive also called Outback corporate for assistance because i would have liked to resolve this somehow, but they do not seem to return calls. I also gave the new owner a few chances to resolve this with me but she just argues for no reason. I will always miss eating here, and wish it was the same Outback ive gone to for almost 20 yrs. But it isnt the same so just go with no expectations, if you go.</review>< response>

They could have provided umbrellas or some kind of shade. The food presentation was not very appealing. It was flavorful but could have been done much better. We've eaten here before, but something has changed. It just wasn't as good as we've had in the past.</Review>< rating>

Steak was very peppery and, although I like a medium rare, to rare steak, mine was barely cooked at all. Plus they gave me the wrong drink. Probs just a bad night, but for us, who don't get a lot of us time...it was really disappointing. Normally our favorite place.</Text>

The food was good, the service was great. Tried chili's first they said 15 min to sit, then when they called our name they said 15 to 25 mins to get a server. We left, and went to outback. It was much better,  got right in, and ordered immediately. I will be back.< /Review>

I used to dog this place but it has killer steaks! Who would've thought? Some menu options are like you're typical chain restaurant, but there's def some treasures. Prime rib, awesome. House salad w ranch, awesome. Coconut shrimp and wings deserve mentions, would be better if they were cheaper tho. Happy hour is just half portions for half the money, except for big beers are LEGIT $1 off!<//review>

My friend ordered Aussie cheese fries and steakhouse quesadillas and they're both pretty good! I actually enjoyed the quesadillas a lot! It was just right amount of meat and cheese in it and the portion was just right! Our server was nice, but I have had better servers at different locations od outback steakhouse. That's why I give it a three star. Overall still a good experience.</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Service was great at this location compared to the one we usually go to in carlsbad, very attentive and easy going. We came for my husbands birthday for lunch. Ribeye steak was perfect and tender. I orderd the pasta with shrimp and chicken breast. Wow the chicken breast was extremely tender and juicy. The best chicken breast of my life seriously. The shrimp was dee- ishiously well seasoned. Wings and the bleu cheese dressing were mouth watering. The seasoning is great but maybe too much for those who eat very bland. But personally i loved it!<//Review>

< Review>
Food was just ok, but for the price I expected more than wilted salad and over cooked meat. They didn’t even have the kids coloring menus, which are my kids favorite part of going to Outback restaurants. However, the service was beyond good. Our server, Daniel, was attentive and great. I just feel the people in the kitchen are the ones dropping the ball.<//Review>

Don’t waste your time coming here, the steaks are blend and they don’t even offer the Mac n cheese. It’s beyond me how they use 17 different seasonings and the steak is still tasteless. I payed $27 for a tasteless steak don’t waste your money or time. I’m from Az and the ones out there would never serve such a disappointment<//review>

I was trying to reach this outback (Clairemont mesa) over the phone for a takeout order since 8:30pm.  I was placed on Hold for over 15 minutes.  I called back to see if that did the trick and finally someone picked up to tell me their kitchen had just closed.  From looking at their website I can see they are supposed to be open until 9:00pm.  It should not take someone over 20 mins to place an order over the phone & then b told sorry you just miss the cut off.  Really unprofessional & it seems this restaurant really doesn’t want people business.<//text>

I was there before the dinner service as lots of folks began to show for dinner--a very good sign that it's a popular place to eat and the food is good.  The service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  I will definitely return.  Well deserving of my 5 stars.< /Text>

<Text>I love outback steakhouse. It's a great place to get a decent steak at a decent price. Whenever I need a steak fix, my choice is almost always this location. I love the staff. Very rarely do I have an issue here. The few times I have had a problem, they were quickly resolved.< /Text>< rate>

<Text>Besides delicious steaks, (with my favorite being Filet Mignon) Outback has the best Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich! Made with the most delicious parts of the steak, it is served hot and is a great alternative to sandwiches and burgers. I've never been served anything less than excellent, across the menu. My husband and I have been regular patrons in the Clairemont Square restaurant, since it opened years ago.< /Text>< Pics>

We are loyal to this Clairemont Outback as the service is great, food is consistent, and drink prices are affordable. We are huge fans of their pork chop and always enjoy their house salads and fresh bread. Consistently a great place to visit, and a great deal when you join their Loyalty Rewards program. 3rd visit gets you 50% off the fourth visit. Sign up for this and reap the benefits!!!< /text>

< Review>
Gotta tell you I was disappointed.  I hadn't been to Outback in a minute but I agreed to meet my friends at 9pm. It was a party of 3 and the restaurant was NOT busy at all.  Everyone ordered salads but I gotta tell you it took FOREVER to get our food, which was good, but the service was slow AF.  Idk if we'll give Outback another chance especially because I ended up getting really sick when I got home. Only other thing I ordered was the baked potato soup with no bacon.</Review>

<Text>We went at 11.30 am ..us two gals wanted to sit and chat.  Our server was attentive before and after our food arrived. Food was great and cooked perfect.  My steak was medium and my friends had hers rare with barely warm center.  Just the way we ordered them.  Salads were fresh and I love their Blue Cheese dressing.  Fresh bread right out of the oven.  No complaints about anything.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Is it amazing? No, but it's a well-seasoned steak. The prices have gone up over the last couple of years, so for us, it's not really worth it. That said, this location had particularly good service. They were very attentive with everything and pretty quick.< /Text>< user_name>

I called on the way and asked if they still have the Steak & Ribs deal? The girl on the phone said yes we do so I proceeded to go to Outback. I seated myself and a server soon came by with a menu. I asked about the Steak & Ribs deal since there was nothing on the menu about it and was told oh no we have this one now pointing to something about steak and salmon. I said is that deal over? He said well I don't know if we even have the menu card anymore because everything is getting ready for Mother's Day. But I will check and see if I can get it for you. Bottom line I got Steak & Ribs and a Coke and a water with mashed potatoes and spent $25 . for lunch.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDb5QI_l7YDPAVqoGK5mwC8oFlJJ1lJOOtS9Xm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

<review>Horrible experience!! Not only were we treated rudely, but the service was horrible. The people who got there AFTER us were waited on, served, ate & left when my date & I had just finished ordering. They took 30 minutes to get our server, another 20 to bring us waters. By the time we had ordered, we were about to go next door to eat instead, but my being pregnant and with cravings took the best of me. We were there for almost 3 hours. Now.. all that into consideration.. let add this. My date and I, hispanics. The people whom i mentioned before, white! So, however the situation may be interpreted, I saw something I hadn't seen in a long time. Descrimination. A person knows when it's being done. And i hope that wasn't the case. But they made me feel so small, and unimportant. So, basically, don't go eat here. I know I won't ever again step foot here again.</review><userid>112872803765221824450<//userid><Gmap_id>0x80dc00f6090890df:0x79532cd03bc31f72< /Gmap_id><username>Fabiola Mijangos<//username><resp>None</resp><time>1575431401767</time><pictures>None<//pictures>< rate>

Awesome service. They were busy but we were able to get seated quickly and were seen by our waiter right away. We were not forgotten about even with the place being busy.

Steaks were great. Cooked to order.

I would go back!</text>

Solid service Everytime we go. Food is tasty, never disappointing and nice quality for the price. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is because the last two times I've gone my steak has been over cooked. Asked for medium and got well done, twice.< /review>

I do like this place - the service is good and it has a friendly atmosphere.  It could be so much better if the steaks, especially the Prime Rib were more tender.  Granted, 27$ is not much for prime rib nowadays, but it is a lot for a tough piece of meat.  Everything else, IMHO, is great, why ruin it with a tough Prime Rib.  For most of us, this is a special dinner, so I hope Outback Clairemont will take the final leap and make this a great dinner. They have so much to offer - I hope they can do it.  They may be a chain restaurant, but are they chained to a certain meat supplier who cannot deliver quality meat? Please make the changes you need to be the great restaurant you could be.  So much care goes into your other items - can't you find a better meat supplier? I sure hope so!
A loyal customer who deserves better.

Try the carrot cake!!!! So delicious. The cake is moist and flavorful and not too sweet and the cream cheese frosting is 😍😍😍. Even my pastry chef roommate thought it was excellent. Our server was lovely, too. Charming, funny, and attentive without being overbearing.<//text>

A very decent steak. They're specials and happy hours are way easier on the wallet. Very fresh veggies and lots of healthy options when you're really looking.
If I'm indulging I have the coconut shrimp the sauce they serve is like orange marmalade.< /review>

Today tuesday january 28 @ 7:35pm, Server was good, food was good. But at the end the experience and service they ripped it off so bad when I tried pay the hostessA send me with the bartender, when I get with the bartender and I tried give the money he just said (rude, arrogant and loud ) " give it to the server !!

Then I went back with the hostessA and the she called the other hostessB
now, the hostessB call the manager and finally the manager took the money and I got my change back.

Before you hire a hostess make sure she is a thinker (criteria) and knows the basic basic basic step.

And your busser or dishwasher I bet they have so much better customer service than the bartender.</Review>

<text>Fantabulous to say the least! The filet mignon was scrumptious and everything else was absolute perfection. The manager was on his toes and was very accommodating. Our server did an excellent job as well. Visiting San Diego for the first time, Outback proved to be an outstanding choice as everything else as delicious and very satisfying.< /text></record>

We came here twice in 9 days here in San Diego. Best Outback, period. The first time we came we got excellent service and great food, even in the middle of the dinner crowd! The second time was even better. My mom got the prime rib, and some people know that some Outbacks can be a little too harsh to the steaks, this one was PERFECT. Definitely 10/10 would come again.</Review>

I wouldn't call it lively, but its where I go for a Prime Minister's prime rib, I get the largest cut. Au Jus is on point, bread is amazing. Blooming Onion is 1800 calories, so pass on that. Sherry mushrooms are amazing. Caesar salad is really good too. Lots of families. Dark in side. Courteous servers.< /Text>

<Review>Service was pleasant and quick, but the food has changed. I can't describe how, but it's not quite what it was a year ago. Kind of tasteless. Could've been me, I'm sure. Maybe I was just having an off night in the taste buds department.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dc00f6090890df:0x79532cd03bc31f72< /gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

My wife and I had a great experience with this Outback. The service was wonderful. I can't thank our server Victor enough. He made sure he gave us the best experience.< /Text>

Very good service. All the bread and butter you can eat. Lots of food. One meal was enough for two of us. Salad and soup. Three different kinds of salad dressing.  Thousand Island, Italian and Ranch. A big steak. Had food left over we took home. Friendly smiling service.< /text>

We went in, sat down, waited a few minutes. No server came to help us so we hit the button to call the server. We waited 10 minutes and no one came to serve us or take drink orders so we got up and left. Terrible service. The place wasn't even crowded.</Review>

The food was great but took 40 minutes to get it even for just our salads and bread. The waiter was to busy to ever check on us. Even the couple behind us was complaining about the time. They really need more staff working at one time. But food was at least great!</review>

<text>We come here because the kids like the cheese fries. Otherwise I'd stop coming. The food is certainly acceptable and pretty much the same as any other Outback. But the service is consistently bad. Our drinks always take a super long time to come out, then stay empty for 15-20 minutes. Apps come a minute before the entrees. Last time they didn't bring us bread. And don't get me started on the all you can eat shrimp. The fact that it's all you can eat relies on your server coming by more than once every 30 minutes.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

We were very disappointed. Our 6 oz. filet looked like a rewarmed old steak with absolutely no flavor. The aussie fries with garlic were fries with a small amount of chopped garlic. We wont be going back.</Review>

I ordered the 6oz fillet and grilled lobster tail with mash potatoes and garden salad. It was a perfect meal! Everything was cooked exactly as I requested and everything was piping hot and deLicious! The wait staff was excellent and courteous also. Very well done Outback Clairemont!<//Review>

<Text>Steak was overcooked, was supposed to be the large choice, but was small like a child's size  with shrimp but came with lobster the size of a crawdad and had no flavor, came with white fake drawn butter instead of regular yellow butter. I complained and they they added 4 miniature shrimp on a stick overloaded with pepper. My wife's coconut shrimp was fine. Won't go back to the Clairemont Outback. The waiter was confused and did not take responsibility for the order mixup. Bad experience on our 51st anniversary. Ugh. Rich</Text>< Rate>

Casual dinning. There is something for everyone on the menu.  Moderately priced. The staff is friendly and attentive.  Nice place for a  casual dinner. Ask about their dinners club.  You get a free dinner every 4th visit.  They offer military discounts and AARP discounts.</text>

Never a bad meal here, but if you come here Thursday-Sunday evening expect to wait as it's always busy. They even have an Aussie waiter, so ladies can travel and have a good-day-mate.</text>

Most Outbacks me and my family have been to have been either mediocre or bad, with the exception of the Woodbury, MN location(Why did it have to close?!?). This location was completely different. We were on vacation in 2016 and we came here, everyone's food was excellent. It was so good in fact, that we came back 2 days later, and it was even better then! My mother ordered the Prime Rib(which can be a gamble) and it was perfect. If I were ever in San Diego again, I would definitely come back.< /text>

<name>Austin S< /name><text>I will not eat here again until they get rid of the screens at the tables that cannot be turned off. Last time I went I could see at least 7 screens flashing and some of the content on the screens were advertisements. I don't want pay 30 dollars for a steak dinner to be bombarded with bright screens that are advertising things that are not related to the restaurant.

Also when it was time to pay the check the waitress made my 73 year old mother use the screen to pay even after I asked for a paper copy of the check. She had a hard time using the machine which was not a nice way to end a expensive meal<//text>< userid>

<Text>Quite disappointed by that place even though I did not come there with high expectations based on reviews and how the building looks like.

The food is OK, but not great. I think they always overcook a bit (I asked rare and got medium, my girlfriend asked medium and got well done...). Considering the price, I feel it is a bit pricey for what you got.

As for the service, definitely not good. After we got served, we never saw the waiter again (even for checkout and we ended up self checkout hopefully...). My girlfriend got seated on a dirty seat. She notified it and only got towels to clean it by herself.

So basically, you pay the price of a good steakhouse for an ok food and poor quality of service.

I dont plan to come back again.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dc00f6090890df:0x79532cd03bc31f72<//gmapID></record>

Wanted to enjoy the All You Can Eat Shrimp with Steak night.......found out it's all you can eat shrimp only if they actually serve you the shrimp. Ordered the extra shrimp as soon as the dinner was served. It didn't show up until after we were finished eating.  This was only one of the problems we had at this Outback. Took forever to be served, food came out moderately warm which was disappointing. During the meal no one checked on us. Ended up going to the bar to get another beer. BTW the place was half full and looked like plenty of wait-staff.</text>

Food was good.  Outback is very consistent.  Place was full at 7PM and service was confused and inconsistent.  The use of table kiosks seems to have dampened the servers enthusiasm for personal service.  Manager oblivious.< /review>

Service is generally good, food is generally good, but if you're facing the front of the restaurant in the afternoon, be prepared to have the sun in your face during dining. No blinds either so don't bother asking them to close them.<//Review>

I don't eat at many chain restaurants any more and it's because of subpar cocktails and food quality. You get what you pay for. Service was good though.</Text>

My family came here for my birthday. Never again will I come here. They had bad service. they got my son and I's meal wrong. He was hungry so he ate his anyway but I sent it back in. It just came out and my family already finished eating. The food was bad. The service was bad. This has ruined my birthday meal. Thanks a lot.</Review>

Sat down at the tables in the bar area. I watched several employees walk by without anyone acknowledging we were there. After seven minutes my daughter and I left, probably never to return to this location again. My daughter and I have attended this location at least 25 times. Sometimes they are short handed, it happens. But when at least 5 servers walk by without acknowledgment it’s time to go elsewhere and get the service I expect. What happened to Outback?< /Text>

The waiter was very nice but the steak that was ordered had to be returned because it was burnt. They called it seared I call it burnt. Burnt meat will cause colon cancer.  This meal was served to a retired doctor. They did bring another steak but was unable to eat because it was dry. Don’t think we’ll be retuning.<//Text>< pictures>

I don't like the changes they have made. Ordered a bloody mary. The drink was in a six ounce glass with so much ice I could barely stir the drink without ice flying out of the glass.  They have also cut back on the slaw on the ahi salad. I will be visiting Black Angus over Outback more often.  Service has gone down too. Personnel changes at the Clairemont restaurant have gone downhill too.</text>

I don't like the changes they have made. Ordered a bloody mary. The drink was in a six ounce glass with so much ice I could barely stir the drink without ice flying out of the glass.  They have also cut back on the slaw on the ahi salad. I will be visiting Black Angus over Outback more often.  Service has gone down too. Personnel changes at the Clairemont restaurant have gone downhill too.< /Text>

Don't go to this Outback. Rubber steak, undercooked potatoes,  canned soup, warm salad. Outback is a family staple for us, this location is badly managed.  I do NOT recommend at all.< /Review>

<review>A bit disappointed. We had always wanted to go there so we waited ' a long time' for our food. Well, the waitress forgot our order and when we got it, the steak was tough and lacking in flavor, the salad was not cool. It seems that it may have been just a bad day for them.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dc00f6090890df:0x79532cd03bc31f72< /gmap_id></record>

The ribs were overcooked and dry....perhaps this is why a pint of bbq sauce was sladder on the ribs. Also the steak had no favor. Will not return to this Outback Steak House.< /review>

Carside service, missing items, called to complain, was put to a voice mail, I'm still awaiting a call. 18 hours later, so I called back. The girl at the other end transferred me back to the order line and I was hung up on. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! The steak was ok, but not worth the hassle.<//text>

Was persuaded to pay extra for their unlimited shrimp option. Big mistake. Plate they serve you with your meal is a good size - after that it's like you're a criminal or something. Tiny little bowls with two or three shrimp, swimming in oil. Terrible. Asked for larger bowl, asked for less oil: wouldn't do either. Finally gave up. Shame the steak was tough too...< /review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Great and traditional meat restaurant !!!
The Australian network is spread across the world, but the menus have some differences between countries.
In the United States of America, you may choose to have shrimp at will to accompany any dish for just $ 9.99.
There are two types of shrimp (breaded and grilled in butter) that can be ordered while the hunger lasts! Worth it !

Ótimo e tradicional restaurante de carnes !!!
A rede Australiana está espalhada pelo mundo, mas os cardápios tem algumas diferenças entre os países.
Nos Estados Unidos da América, é possível que você opte por camarão à vontade para acompanhar algum prato por apenas U$9,99.
São dois tipos de camarão (empanado e grelhado na manteiga) que podem ser pedidos enquanto durar a fome ! Vale a pena !</text>
