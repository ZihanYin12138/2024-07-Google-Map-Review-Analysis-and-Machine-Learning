I went to this establishment after a long flight. It's walking distance from my hotel. The customer was great. I ordered wings and they were delicious. Went back the next day. The same great customer service. This time I ordered the Cedar Plank Salomon and it was delicious as well. I would definitely visit this establishment again.<//Text>

Finally, great pizza in our area. Menu has huge variety of specialty pizzas, pastas, sandwiches and salads.  They even have home made desserts. Best pie in San Diego County!< /review>

In town for the night and I support local business over the big chains all day.
Simplest way I can say it is this. Great Pizza, Great Service, Great Price.
I’ll definitely do business here agin.<//text>

Greasy, Cheesey and Crispy. Wonderful ❣️ I enjoyed and admired the balance. Of course the pie was fresh and made to order. I didn't want to bother the owner with any questions until I try other items. That's right I'm going back and highly recommend it.</review>

It lost a star because I was waiting for the pizza just outside of the door.  After a long wait, I had to ask if it was available.  In fairness to the front desk, the task being handled by the order person kept here focused on too many chores for a timely customer waiting response.< /Text>< pictures>

Great pizzas and solid variety. No pizza by the slice, but the mini personal pizzas MORE than deliver and you can be certain that they'll be fresh, not reheated. Bravo leucadia pizzeria< /text>

<text>This pizza place completely messed up my order AND there was gross long hair all mixed around in the Lobster Mac and Cheese. I ordered about 40 minutes before closing (I hate being that person, but time gets away from us occasionally). I only ordered 2 simple small pizzas and the mac. When I called the next day to let them know what happened and ask for a refund, they told me I couldn't get one and had to take store credit or nothing else. What kind of business runs like that? I work in food and bev and we always offer refunds when orders go that wrong. Definitely will not be eating here ever again.< /text>< pictures>

My kids LOVE the calzone options, and the pizza, pasta, and garlic bread is the best! Wait times can be a little long in the evenings, best to order ahead if possible on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night. The owner is an amazing human being, and she LOVES her customers and it shows. I had an issue with an order one Saturday night, and she called me personally to work out the details and make sure everything was perfect. We will continue to be fans, and will recommend to all of our friends and family. Try them out, you'll be SO glad you did! Try the lobster pizza or the lobster mac, it's seriously amazing!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

If you're familiar with the other Leucadia Pizzeria, then you will find the food just as amazing as the other locations. I'm a fan of the cheesy garlic bread and I recommend you try it if you haven't yet. The only downside to this location is the missing seating area. There is a shared courtyard with the taco place next door but not much as far as indoor seating.</review>

We're here from out of town and yelped this place and decided to give it a try. Combo pizza was by far one of the best pizza's I've had! We ordered Fried Calamari, Fried Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Strips and the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich and they were all DA BOMB! No regrets, I would highly recommend this place. I don't really write reviews bit this place was well worth the effort!!!< /text>

7E2-30D: Good small pizza place that we did not know about for so many years. The order taker/cashier was very helpful. He explained all their pizza options very well. They also deliver where we live,😊,</review>

I'm a big fan of Leucadia Pizzeria in general, and  this location has always been great in my experience in terms of the quality of food and service. My favorite pies to get from here are the barbeque chicken and margherita, although I feel like it would be hard to go wrong with any of them.<//Text>

Great pizza and fast delivery. We love the gf pizzas, they're big, crunchy, and very good! Highly recommend this restaurant for pizza, better than everywhere else in my opinion!

We did have to order online bc the phones weren't working.... this only happened this one time.</Text>

When I have no other option this place makes it happen. However the work they do is rushed, lazy and they speak about you negatively in their language. The prices are steep and it is extremely over crowded. Enter at your own risk.<//Review>

<review>I have been getting mani pedis here for years. I usually get gel or acrylic and love my nails every time. I recently found out they do eye lash extensions and I’m in love! I feel put together as soon as I roll out of bed. I get so many compliments. I was skeptical about extensions but I am so happy with them!</review>< Name>

The lady by the front door has no customer service!! Don't ask how You want Your nails rush to get done!! She did a very sloppy job!!! I'm very disappointed with My nails!! Different shapes and sizes My nails look like there a week old and I just walked out the shop!!! She didn't clean or cut My nails down!!! I'll have to go somewhere else Monday to see if They could fix My nails really can't go to work looking like this!!! 😤🤬< /Text>

Today I went to get my thumb nail fixed because the lady who did them coated them 5 times so it got bubbly and it popped yesterday, it still had fresh nail polish inside!!!! Now you can see all the layers of nail polish on my nail and it looks UGLY. I will never come here again, they don't give you what u pay for. I waited, waited and waited to get it fixed and ended up leaving with my ugly thumb nail again. So dissatisfied.< /text>< pics>

They do a great job and they don't rush to do your nails and the pedicure wow they make your feet feel clean and soft. They have different prices but its worth it paying there I wouldn't go no where else. Once u  go there you will keep going back.love all who work there . They are all friendly.</Text>

<name>Ixy Marin< /name><date>1576989816206<//date><rating>1</rating><Text>If I could give this zero stars i would. ABSOLUTELY WORST PLACE THAT CAN EXIST. I simply went in to get my acrylics taken off you’d think that it would go without any problems. This lady I did not get her name but she proceeds to rip off my acrylics instead of soaking them off because I came in 30 minutes before closing. So instead of properly taking off my nails she decided to proceed to rip them off first two came off no problem then she ripped my third nail off as you can see in the picture. She wouldn’t even let me see my nail she very quickly decided to put nail glue on it and then proceeded to try and cover up her mistake. I was preoccupied with my friend who had came with me and didn’t notice until later. After she ripped off my nail she switched methods and decided to soak off the rest of them which she should’ve done in the first place. The worst part. She wouldn’t give me my money back. I had paid her in advance so I didn’t have to hold the cash on me and when I asked for my money back she refused saying that things happen like that all the time. I honestly feel like she should be fired. Her negligence as a nail technician is absolutely terrible. I’ve never had this happen. And I would NEVER come back.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9T8zSE0vvDE0AWcw-Dpynz7NYSh7hNUBFSD00=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

I took a chance coming here and I don't regret it! I got a gel manicure. The tech was nice and very gentle. The manicure ended with a massage of my hands and arms. My friend got a full set of acrylics which ended up beautiful! Will definitely come back and recommend to friends!!!< /text>

Second visit and I'm a happy camper. I have only lived in Desert Hot Springs for a few months but I am pleased with their service. Please keep in mind that this is a smaller nail shop and they tend to get very busy. Waiting has not been an issue, but I have had to wait to be seen both times. I can't complain. Staff was pleasant and friendly.</Text>

Love these folks. Got a manicure, pedicure and waxing today. They are always busy, so go early for no wait. I was there at 9 a.m. on Saturday. Great prices too. Get the extras on your pedicure. You 'll be glad.< /review>

My 3 girls nails were beautiful but my pedicure was not. She did not clean my nails nor did she do callous remover even though i paid for it. She did one coat polish i can't even see. I was not happy at all.<//review>

I have been going there since they opened a year ago! Best prices and service and I got my nails done the way I wanted, what I pay for! The owners left and sold the business and new people came in! They broke every nail, changed price every time I went in, polish jobs horrible and never could get the shape right!I go in for the the usual and they tell me they cannot help me anymore that I am too picky! I tell them I've been a customer since it opened and I've never had this problem! They pointed to the right to refuse service sign and kicked me out! Horrible service and inexperienced nail technicians.....</review>

I'm here on MLK day...honestly I do not take the time to write reviews but I am beyond discussed, I walked out and opened car door nails are long mind you I usually always have my nails long.one broke and Ivy tells me ...this last time we fix for free..i have been coming here because of convenience but poor service, nail files are reused not sterilized right after ...mind you while David fix my nail he ripped my nail bed in half it is bleeding...he hurrying up to put acrylic on to stop pain or me taking pictures...did not ask if ok but insisted on not service me anymore ...i hope people are very aware of cleanliness of place and they up charge for everything I couldn't even get 2 colors on nails with out an upcharge....Ivy and David and her aunt are greedy people and the aunt is a liar...again I had only been going there because of convenience but not any amount of money would allow me to go back</Text>

Nice people clean shop. But that is where it ends. Had my nails filled, when I got home I had to remove the awful polish job and refile and rebuff all my nails. They were so wide, thick and ruff. I will go back and try someone else.< /text>

I don't know about anyone else? but when I go for a pedicure and manicure  I want them done separate.  I want them to take their time, not rushing me out in 30 minutes for both jobs. Got cut and they didn't clean under neath nails.<//Text>

Very bad experience.. All i asked for was to have my nails painted with gel & they charged me 28 dollars! Which i would be fine with if the lady did a good job but it looks like my little sister painted my nails. There is finger nail polish all around my fingers & you can see through the polish because she only did 2 coats. The lady didnt even try to take the polish off of my skin. My nails just look terrible. So when it came time to pay i wasn't really happy with what i got so i tipped her 2 dollars and the guy at the counter decided to yell to the shop full of people what i tipped her. Very unhappy with my visit will not be going back..EVER!< /text>

I told the owner that my nails or gels and he kept on working on my nails and put acrylic on them then later tells me they have no gels. Within 2 days I have one broken nail within 4 days I had three broken nails not very happy about that will never return I feel they should be honest and upfront about what they're doing before they start working on your nails<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Rushed service, couldn’t relax because I had a Kid doing my pedicure that came out sloppy and I had the owner doing my nails at the same time. The owner rushed through my fill and left my nails lumpy and un even. This was my fourth time coming in and I will not be coming back. Plus they charge so much to do a simple service</Text>< pictures>

It is expensive services.  The lady that completed my service was a bit rude after asking her questions.  She appeared disturbed.  I could get nails, eyebrows and a pedicure for 51.00 with gel including a design versus paying over 100.00.<//Text>

This Co turned me over to a collection agency, for towing a car that was sold and notice sent to "DMV Release of Liability"

The value of the car was $800 when I sold it, E & C Towing want over $2500 in storage and towing fees.  Total jerks.  Remember they are authorized and hired by our City.  I will be filing a complaint with the City and sending a letter to the City Manager and each City Counselman< /text>

My car died and I had to be towed home, 96 miles!! AAA told me it would be approx. 1.5 hours before a tow truck could get there. It was dark and getting cold. As I sat in my car feeling vulnerable and a little scared, I said to myself… “I need a hero!”  Just a quick 20ish minutes later, Rodney from E&C Towing showed up!!  Rodney was polite, professional, and efficient as he hooked up my car. He was kind and thoughtful as he invited me to wait in the truck where it was warm and a true gentleman as he asked if I needed assistance getting in.  (It was a really BIG flatbed truck!)  I was surprised at how nice, comfortable and clean the truck was.  The long ride home was actually delightful as Rodney drove carefully and safely through the heavy traffic.  The conversation was polite, interesting and I felt like I was just taking a drive with a longtime friend.  Rodney turned a stressful and scary situation into a pleasant one.  If you are a woman alone and ever find yourself stuck and in need of a hero, call E&C Towing and ask for Rodney!< /text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>My son was in a head on car accident less than a mile from E & C..I am the registered owner and was not called as to what to do about my car..I have AAA and could have towed it home..instead they towed it..600 for towing and 79. A day storage. This happened on a saturday and so a few hours later I went to the yard to retrieve 2 items and they charged me a 100.00. The other driver was dui and her fault. My car has been there since 6 27 and I cant pay the thousands to get it out..my finance co..my lawyer and the insurance for the other driver have not been allowed on premises..without this I will get nothing and I still owe 11900. I called the yard today and the girl lied and said various companies have come onsite  to see the car.  She was rude as hell and strait lied. They also already sold my car to a lien sales and it leaves 8 4.20.  I cant believe a business can do this. I dont know what to do. I'm car less now and all I need is it deemed totalled otherwise I have to pay my loan for 4 more yrs..when I told E & C this..the girl said. Sucks to be you. Who can I  file a complaint with on this business..Evelyn should not be allowed to work there< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80db1f5c29729e91:0x92536f4dc75a0f11< /Gmap_id></record>

So I called AAA to tow my rv I had classic rv coverage and the called or local stave towing which was 3 miles away and the rv was going 6 miles away to get worked in at a ranch so Steve towing called me and said they can't to it they need a landall or lowboy to tow so AAA called a few other companies they said they can't tow as well so then they call E&C towing and they drove from desert hot springs to Lake Elsinore to do a 6 mile tow when the other towing companies shame on them and thanks to Andrew and E&C towing for stepping up going about going about 120 miles round trip about 4 hours or so Andrew did it with a smile best tow companies I have ever used in my entire life next to Dan Zavala in La and Oc area I have delt with tow companies as I run a plumbing business and we travel all over so cal and this company was fast arrived way sooner then expected I will be using them as well as I have friends in the desert so I will refer them as their my Low Desert towing company< /text>

Everything was going great until we had to pay then it went from 150 to 350 right when we signed and gave card info! Why? Just set the price from the get go no need for a shakedown. Be up front of what the cost is.<//text>

Hats off to Andrew for a supremely well done job!  He did an extremely "hard to do" job with skill and a great attitude!
He carefully made a plan and the checked it often for safety as he was completing the tow!
Applause for the whole team from the telephone contact starting point to the payment help!
Thank you so much E&C TOWING for towing my truck to safety ....Constance</review>

< review>
I am the property manager of a commercial property in Desert Hot Springs, CA. I had a problem with an illegally parked vehicle and I called E&C  and they tried their best...even stuck around the whole time without a problem & called in a second truck. I really appreciated the effort, since I haven't been able to find it from their competition. The employees were incredibly nice and professional. I'd recommend to hire them for sure.</review>

Super prompt after waiting over 1 1/2 hours for USAAs "preferred" provider Pride Towing, who kept pushing back their arrival time.  Driver very friendly and professional. He definitely knew what he was about. Would use again and recommend.< /Text>

Good effort, optimistic about arrival time, but the kicker was the very simple, accurate old-fashioned directions that were ignored. Driver got frustrated and nearly gave up. Pay attention, young people, cause ol'guys got the money.<//review>

Call another company. Called insurance for a tow to dealership and my tow was covered by insurance. Instead guy takes my car to a sketchy mom and pop shop that was already closed, and didnt have a drop box for the key. So the guy calls us back, telling us he can either drop the key back off to us for 20$, or bring the car back for 45$. So now you're trying to make me pay for my car back, when you didnt even take it to the correct place? My guess is that shop pays you to tow cars there and people have this problem quite often. Horrible, horrible customer service from start to finish, if i could give 0 stars i would.</Text>

I miss the original Peony on Rancho California (in the Albertson shopping center). However, I enjoyed their freshly cooked foods at this new location. I ordered the food twice in this past few months.  I was not too fond of the Moo Shu Chicken. I have had better ones. Other than that it was a good take out Chinese Dinner.< /Text>

<rate>3</rate><review>The Chicken Egg Foo Young was not what I expected.  I'm used to and love the East Coast version of this dish.  Was hoping to get it again here.  I'm talking about egg omelets filled with meat, bean sprouts and other veggies in a thick brown sauce.  Here, the omelets tasted like eggy bread dumplings with very little veggies or other ingredients inside.  Bland.
Instead of a brown sauce, there was an entire different dish served on top.  Kind of like a Chicken Kung Pao with battered chicken chunks, water chestnuts, pea pods and carrots.  As a matter of fact, I didn't discover the omeletes underneath until I had a serving at home.  I thought they gave me the wrong dish.

Didn't like the omelets at all.  Tasteless filler.  But the chicken dish on top was good.  Nice peanut flavor.  Not enough sauce to wet the rice, though.  I suspect this is a good restaurant.  I just need to figure out their menu and find things I'd like.  The dinner-sized dish was enough for four good meals for me, so great value for money.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8zTkGauLDNKqFtbqQYPyCAYmDAeBu7cMNHgY3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEtwL-amkImIbrtjiVTU9j0ZvKx9RrEF2Nv0fF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80db7faa213be2f9:0x7ccfcd2bca1d0960</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Awesome food. Very large dishes. Be prepared to take some home. Price was perfect. Fed 5 adults with 4 take home boxes (we divided the left overs equally into the cartoons to create full meals) all for under $80 + tip. We ordered 3 entrees (orange chicken, curry chicken, garlic shrimp)(a healthy amount of white rice is included), plus 2 sides (simple fried rice, so good and house chow mien, this is no ordinary chow mien, it has chicken, beef and shrimp, yes all 3 in 1). Granted there may be some nights we could finish more but we'd be stuffed to sickness. Also, its a very relaxed atmosphere, TV playing and diner type tables and chairs. And to top it off the food came out fast. Go for it. You'll love it.<//Review>

< Review>
Had a big urge for Chinese food, after finding our usual place Fannies Wok unexplicitly closed on a Sunday, we decided to go to Peony's after reading the good reviews. We were very disappointed. We knew we were in trouble when within 5 minutes of ordering our entire order appeared, soup, appetizer and main course. This might be a positive to some people, but to us it means they didn't prepare the food fresh. The portions are huge, but not appealing. The service was good, but when the tab was almost $70 for the three of us, we definitely won't be back.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>My husbands favorite Chinese Food Place ever. He has talked about Peonies in his sleep to me before. We went and had the House special Beef and chicken with Rice and eggrolls. That's our favorite meal to get. We are always full and satisfied when we leave. The staff is very friendly and always ready to answer questions and make friendly suggestions. 10/10 great.< /Review><userid>103914208897757903803</userid><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmap_id>

The cream cheese wontons changed my life. There, I said it. They're unbelievably good. I love them. My kids love them. My wife loves them. They're perfect. The edges are perfectly crisp, and the inside is wonderfully creamy.

We've been coming here for over 15 years, and every meal has been delicious. It's been mostly the same employees the entire time too. It's a special place. Speaking of special, try the house special chicken. Actually, try anything, it's all great.< /text>

Placed a phone order at 1:15pm. They told me it would be 10 minutes. I got there at 1:40pm and my order was still not ready.  I told how much longer for my order to be ready and they had the nerve to tell me five more minutes! I asked what is the point of calling it in ahead of time? They said with a straight face "we can't start it because sometimes customers don't come in to pick it up!" Are they for really! What business on their right mind thinks like this! Unbelievably worst service experience ever.  Food is great but service needs training.< /Review>

Great food! I love coming here! I've been coming here for years and love it. Recommend dining in that take out. It you order take out, the portions are smaller and seem mushy. Just eat there! The staff is nice and very clean. It's modern but with splashes of Chinese culture (like cool komonos!).< /text>

<text>Service Excellent through our the meal. Everyone very pleasant and helpful. Egg Flour Soup very good, Cream Cheese Won Tons were fabulous. Beef & Broccoli was best I have ever had. Orange Chicken was great. Our third entree was Lemon Chicken was the only one that was not up to par, chicken was just fried battered and cut in strips, a lemon sauce was served on the side, was very thin and didn't stick to the chicken, not very good and it was cold, so we asked them to heat it up for us.. Steamed Rice was included, and there was plenty of food, had lots of leftovers, that they packed for us, including togo cups of all the sauces. Overall a great experience!</text>< UserId.>

Food was hot, but very bland, mushy and pricey... $65.00 for take out ... three dishes, four small egg rolls and soup. Very disappointed because once you are home with take out, it is too much trouble to go back and complain. Ordered beef and broccoli... broccoli was way over cooked... no spice in the spicy dishes marked spicy... Ordered Wonton soup... very bland with little taste so I added the duck sauce and soy sauce for flavor and the fresh veggies (carrots, snow pea pods, mushrooms) made it okay.  As I am writing this, I recall we went here two years ago and waited for nearly half an hour for take out and they gave our order to the wrong customer as we waited, so we waited for them to prepare it again. We will not go back for a third bad experience.</Review>

Love this place! Always very friendly if I choose to sit and eat there or if I'm getting takeout. I usually order the chicken chow mein or, if I'm there for lunch, the shrimp with vegetables 😋 I would recommend trying to go around lunch time to sit in so you can get a free bowl of egg flour soup (sadly they don't give you the free bowl of soup if you get their lunch takeout). I have never been disappointed getting food from here</Review>

This place has been in Temecula for 20 years.  There is a good reason why.  If you want real Chinese food like the kind from NY, but here in CA...then stop reading and give it a try.  You will not be disappointed.</text>

Had the house chicken and a few cream cheese wontons. I absolutely cannot express the deliciousness of these wontons. Cooked to perfection. The chicken was delicious as well but a tad over cooked which is why I cant give it 5 stars but the flavor was on point. Perfect steamed rice.

Whoever their chef is mastered texure cooking. Made eating their food all the better.</Review>

<review>It seems like this kind of resturaunt is becoming more popular, at least in southern california. You go in, order your food, then they bring it to you, and wait on you...

Foodwise, I recommend the orange chicken, and the sweet and sour pork, I really enjoyed those, and my husband really liked the garlic shrimp.< /review>< Time>

Our television didn't work until the second day we were there and they only offered me $25 discount. We were celebrating our 1st Anniversary as a married couple and wanted to watch a movie our first night. All the receptionist said was "Were sorry See ya tomorrow". For $800.00 I expected better service and more if a discount. They screwed  up our Anniversary!<//review>

It was me who was assisting with this issue during your stay and that is not at all what I said or how I said it. We went to the room and tried to fix the issue immediately. Again, I'm sorry we weren't able to get it to work on the first night, but I'm glad to see the issue was resolved during your stay. You did not mention any concerns to me over the amount of the discount at check out; however, you did mention to me directly that you planned on coming back and staying with us again. I hope we exceed your expectations next time. Please feel free to reach out to me directly should you decide to book a return stay.\nKind regards,\nJennifer P\nGeneral Manager"}<//resp>< gmap_id>

<time>1619222400000</time><rating>None< /rating><text>Lovely place across the street from moonstone beach. We had a downstairs room with a patio and a view of the ocean. The room was a good size and had a frig, microwave and coffee maker. The issue was the fireplace was not working and the heater was very noisy, clanging. When we requested another room, we were told that there was none comparable available. We slept with the heater off (the temp was in the 50's). Also, I'd recommend a upstairs room, as we could hear the people above us walking around. There was also was a small amount of mold in the shower, but it's the beach.<//text>< pictures>

Lovely. Will stay again. Clean, super friendly and helpful staff. Complimentary wine at arrival and a gorgeous ocean view from the room’s balcony. This small, modern looking motel is everything you’re looking for in when staying in Cambria. The fireplace was a great addition as it took the ocean chill off in the evening and early morning. It’s a 2-story hotel with no elevator so travel light. The bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve encountered in my years of travel.</text>

Although the staff was very helpful, this hotel is in desperate need of an update. Beautiful views don't make a hotel experience wonderful if you can't enjoy the inside of the room. The room was very old and the heater did not work. Another hotel guest had to come in to fix it because there was no maintenance on the grounds that day - not very comforting during a pandemic. Although, as I said before, the manager was very helpful and accommodating, this is a sign that central heating should be installed. If it weren't for the great front line ocean view, I would not return to this hotel.< /Review>

< Review>
We had an oceanfront room. Beautiful view of the ocean across the street. Saw 3 whales spouting in the distance. The boardwalk walking trail was right there. Next door to Moonstone Grill and 5 min. walk to Sea Chest restaurant. Only 2 negatives for the room:  TV is not hi-def. and there is a step down from bathroom to the bed area. Very problematic for older people although we were well warned by management. We put a white towel on that area to remind us of the step and had no issues. Would stay there again.< /Review>

Small, super clean and steps away from the beach. The front office staff was friendly and helpful. Sure I guess the furniture could use an upgrade like some other review noted but the bathroom has been re done. I like a small hotel that I just pull in, park and check in.  I would definitely stay here again and I would try to get one of the front suites with a patio. There's a great coffee shop in town, Cambria Coffee. Otherwise I would bring some breakfast and lunch stuff. There are a bunch of good dinner places in town. And bring a chair or two for the beach. And don't miss the elephant seals or Hearst Castle when it re opens.</review>

<Text>This property definitely needs a facelift.  The furniture is old and worn, bathroom outdated - I found the sink vanity inside the closet!  Thankfully the bed was comfortable, but the room was very disappointing.  Will not be staying there again,< /Text></record>

Loved our stay here! We stayed here about 20 years ago and it was still just as nice as I remember. Views of the ocean and nice outdoor fire pit. Great stay!<//text>

A little dated but the cottages where cute.  No maid service, but it would have been ok if they just picked up the trash.  It was overflowing when we left.  Fireplace was nice but don't count on it for heat just nice ambiance.   They did have coffeemaker and shampoo and soap.  They have a hairdryer, iron and board.  A small microwave and refrigerator.   Make sure the refrigerator temp is turned up.  Overall really a nice surprise.  Some of the reviews had us worried.<//text>

Cambria Landing is right across the street from the beach and the boardwalk. You can hear the beach waves from our room! The room was clean and comfortable. Check-in was quick and easy. Wonderful place to stay!<//Text>

Got a balcony room looking over the ocean, that part is neat, albeit small.
The room itself seems dirty/shabby. Its apparent that its been awhile since the furniture has been shampooed, as the arms to the chairs have stains. The floor in the bathroom looks gross, and it makes me hesitant to take off my shoes to walk around on the carpet.
Overall, the hotel was okay. No real deal-breakers... i would just be more likely to stay in my usual hotel instead of these properties.< /Text>

<text>I want to say, I will be staying here again the next time I visit Cambria. With that said, there were some minor issues to out hotel room. Upon going into our hotel room ( we booked the partial ocean view) my wife said the bathroom smelled of urine. I will say it smelled a little funky to me, but not enough to make a complaint about it. What did warrant a complaint was that there were a couple of spiders in the top corner of the shower. But the front desk person came up quickly to take care of the issue. Our room came with a fireplace which we were looking forward to using. It did not work. We called again to the front desk and the front desk person did try to fix it, but ultimately could not. She offered couple different room options that did not have a view of the ocean; we opted to just stay in our room. She gave us a discount for the fireplace not working. We were in a rush checking out, and we left some items in our room. The front desk person called me hours later after check out to get my home address to mail it out to me; they paid for shipping. So, yes, there were some minor issues, but the view the room overall was clean and the value of the room with the view was great. Cambria Landing had great customer service and went out of their way to make it right for us. Great attitudes, and that is why we will stay here again.<//text>< date>

<review>Great room with king bed and jacuzzi. We had a patio with a partial view of the ocean.  Wife and I really enjoyed our few days away from the city. Ocean view was amazing and we enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese watching the sun set from our patio. Rooms were clean and hotel staff was amazing. May make this our yearly get away spot.</review>< gmapID>

<text>Average but outdated hotel. Apparently due to covid-19 they don't change sheets, even though it's the day after Valentine's day so keep that in mind.</text>< Pics>

{'time': 1613580292315, 'text': "Hi Kyle,\nThank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm sorry to hear there seems to be some misunderstanding about our operations. Due to covid-19, our housekeeping team spends more time in each room cleaning and sanitizing. We absolutely change all of the linen in each room after each stay. We also use an electrostatic sprayer to sanitize furniture. However, for the safety of all our guests and team members, we are not currently providing stayover cleaning service for  guests staying more than one day. If extra linens are needed for a multiple night stay, the front desk team is happy to provide it. I'm sorry your stay was not up to expectations. Safe travels\nKind regards,\nJennifer P\nGeneral Manager"}</resp>

Stay here! Our room 201 had a full ocean view and the ocean was so close I could almost touch it from our bed. We fell asleep listening to the waves crashing against the rocks and was our much needed therapy. Very relaxing! Full coffee station in the hall outside our door. Great shower! Fireplace added a romantic touch. We will be back..
But we will bring our own pillows next time as the pillows that came with the room are ...not the best.
Thanks, Cambria Landing!</text>

<review>This place is super cute, right on the ocean, amazing views. The rooms are clean, and the bed is super comfy. Great customer service,  wine and cheese offerings each evening, cute fire pits outside facing the ocean. The rooms aren't luxurious in terms of decor, fixtures, etc. You are paying for the view. We love this place- it was our 4th time. We will be back.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1599268508357, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.

The place was great.  Comfy bed, clean room great price.  I was a little irked in the morning when the breakfast order arrived and it had an additional $7.50 in fees that were not listed on the ordering menu...  Other than that, the room was really nice for the price and a nice place to stop on my motorcycle ride up the Pacific Coast.< /Text>

<Time>1589903034207< /Time><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Meh. One of the only good things about this hotel was the Jacuzzi tub in the room. (which is very spacious, worked well and a joy to watch TV from) While the view from the patio in the partial ocean view rooms is really spectacular, you have 0 privacy. we were staring at the guests  in front of us the entire time and you can hear their conversations. If you enjoy privacy, you won't get it in the partial ocean view room patios. It can't be helped, its just the way the property is set up and something that would keep me from coming back. The beds were pretty hard and definitely not good for side sleepers. It seemed every time we went to the front desk (check in, to ask them about the fireplace not working, etc) nobody was there and we had to wait a while. Probably short staffed because of covid.
Our fireplace didn't work (to be fair, the front desk clerk did call us back later to let us know she thought she figured it out but we weren't really interested in the fireplace any longer) and there wasn't a smoke detector in the room. There were wires for it but looked like someone had taken it off? We advised the clerk on check out. I'm sure they'll get that fixed. There are a lot of hotels in this stretch and I'd probably try a different one before coming back here. Unless you really want to hangout in a jacuzzi in a large room, if that's what you're looking for, stay here. the jacuzzi really was great< /Review>< Pictures>

Aside from those minor complaints I would have to say this was the perfect location to unplug and unwind. My husband and I had a beach front room. We spent time walking on the beach, in the early mornings we were able to sit on the patio and enjoy our breakfast and in the evenings enjoy a glass of wine while watching the sunset. If you want to get away without the high cost of air travel, i definitely recommend this location.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>5< /Rate>< user_id>

I have never written a negative review before but everyone needs to know about this hotel. I booked this hotel for my parents anniversary, online the rooms look beautiful and clean and new. Well when my parents arrived the moment they walked in it had a really bad smell, the carpets were badly stained, the chairs out on the patio were falling apart, the wall paper by the hot tub was peeling. I paid 300 plus a night for this place and it definitely isnt worth it now. I would definitely check out other hotels before this one. On the other hand they are super nice and did refund me for the 4 nights but they need to clean and update the place for those prices.< /review>

Its a great location and the partial views of the ocean are great.  In the regular rooms (with no ocean view), youre going to want to leave the shades closed.  The little gas fireplace took the edge off of the cool ocean aire.</text>

<review>Lovely place, and we had an ocean-view room (on our request) that added to the feeling of being on vacation. Room lighting was very dim, but the room had a fridge and microwave, which we found very helpful. Front desk help very nice and quickly attended to any of our requests.<//review>< gmapID>

< review>
The hotel and location are beautiful but not a fair trade for the service. After a near 6 hour drive we arrived to find the initial check in was very uncomfortable and the woman who was at the front desk was unwelcoming and almost pretentious. This was a big disappointment because our plans were actually set in pismo beach and the only reason we drove the extra hour north was just to stay at this property for the view and whirlpool bathtub. I'm not sure if the treatment was due to us not being their ideal hotel guests (lower class hipanic lesbian couple) or if this is the experience everyone who stays here has. Either way it was strange because after being informed our reservations didn't exist and there were no other rooms available for the weekend, the manager finally got involved and somehow found our "cancelled reservations" as well as a whirlpool suite for us to stay in. Just to add to our overall experience the room stunk like cat pee and after being made to feel so out of place following our check in, we decided not to complain.</review>

I like the central location along the road and how close we are to the beach.  The room was clean and like the availability of drinking water (hot or cold) just outside our room.  Only major thing was the smell when we first entered the room, it was an overwhelming smell of food and the bathroom had an unpleasant smell as well.  Otherwise, both front desk staff (night of our arrival Nov 27 a male staff and the female day staff) were all very helpful and approachable.</review>

The staff is very friendly and their happy hour is a great way to relax at the end of a long adventurous day.  The beds are really comfy with amazing pillows.  I'm a pillow person and never had to use the one I brought.  From the hot tubs to the fire pits it's a great little gem of a place.  The only criticism I would give is the continental breakfast is all sweets so maybe bring your own healthier option.  BUT...they have great coffee and teas options so you're all set there. Highly recommend Cambria Landing.</Review>< Gmap_id>

The room we had was a nice size.and the beds were nice. Both of the 2 chairs and the sofa looked to have bodily fluid stains. There was only 1 small fan in the room for a 2 bed room?  I understand no air conditioning as they're next to the ocean but the only windows in the room were on the same wall. So even with the windows open the air couldn't flow through the room.<//Review>

<text>Book the King Jacuzzi Suite, totally worth it. We stayed here for our honeymoon and had a lovely time. The room had a nice tub for two, a gas fireplace, beverage cooler, and microwave. The staff were all fantastic and helpful. We walked on the boardwalk every day when it wasn't raining.

I do have some notes for management:
*Time to replace the beds, the pillow tops on the mattresses are showing signs of breaking down
*The webbing on the lounger chairs out front is failing, time for those to go into a dumpster
*Robe hooks the back of the bathroom would be a welcome addition
*Grab bars next to the jacuzzi tub would also be welcome as the slate tiles are extremely slippery for wet feet<//text>< pictures>

Superior Ocean view room with a glass window corner.  My mom, who atte 89 can't get around much - watched & listened to it there all day. Otherwise, no complaints.  They offer (free) pastries and coffee in the lobby for breakfast and a 4 pm wine reception.

Beach area was interesting to walk on.

We went there at Christmas partly to see the Cambria Christmas Market light show. We loved it and the atmosphere in this little town so much that going to Cambria for Xmas is our newest tradition.

Moonlight restaurant next door... It really surprised me to find a chef with these skills in such a small town.  Very impressed.</review>

Get an ocean-view room! This is our second stay. We had the second jacuzzi ocean-view room from the street this time. Lovely views with seating facing the ocean. And a small patio with seating/table. The gas fireplace adds a romantic touch as well as heat. Everything was clean and comfortable. We like to leave a window partially open to hear the surf while enjoying the jacuzzi tub or relaxing in the room. Friendly staff. Wine and cheese happy hour is nice, coffee in the morning good (pastries are okay, not a huge variety). We will be back!< /Text>

Place is beautiful rooms are cozy good place the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is the lady at the front desk just kept giving us dirty looks don't know why and also was trying to make it a bit difficult to check in don't know why because everyone else that kept coming in she treated them like family but other than that it's beautiful and a romantic getaway< /Review>

<review>Just before we entered our room I noticed dog pea on the door. We walked in and it smelled like a dog shelter. Had very musty dog smell. The lotion was half used, the chairs had stains on them. The Television was extremely pixilated. We asked for another room and it was no better. For $300+ a night I expected a lot better. The mirrors have the glue from behind seeping thru and you can see it. Location is nice and enjoyed the convenience of the fake turf right out the back door. But that was the only thing going for it. Ended up staying at the sea otter inn the next day and it was way better and cheaper by $100.< /review>< name>

Nice place! "Ocean view" is a stretch but if you really look you can see it, and if you open the window you can fall asleep to the ocean sound. For the money - a no brainer. Would stay again.< /text>

This is the perfect couple getaway. The room we got had a jacuzzi which made Cambria inn stand out more than the other hotels I looked into. It also has a fireplace and a walk in shower. Its luxury all the way around and It's right across from the beach.<//Text>

We enjoyed our stay. They had many little extras that we liked in particular. Wine and cheese was offered in the evenings There were fire pits overlooking the beach. The bed was comfortable. However, the shower was not great. Low water pressure and vacillating between hot and cold.</Text>

Our favorite place to go to.
We've been going here for 20 years.
We always stay in the suites, the front ones, they have the best views & I love that they added 2 outdoor fireplaces. Perfect to watch the sunset (when you can) drink your wine & sit by a cozy warm fire & watch the ocean.<//review>

Simply beautiful. Worth the price, not fancy or elegant, just beautiful. Room is nice, bed is cozy, but the view......the view is gorgeous. You can hear the waves chashing and the gulls crying. Beautiful.</Review>

Room was spacious, clean & had a fireplace. Heaters could use a cleaning, though. Check-in and check-out were fast. Front desk closes at 10pm, so no late-comers tramping down the hall with their roll-away suitcases making noise. We would stay there again.< /Review>

<user_id>111378788097336954347<//user_id><Text>Great location with a view of the beach on the second floor. It's cute quiet and quaint. Only downside that I didn't like were two things:
1) they do not offer a breakfast like the other inns nearby, but there is a lovely sweet fruit and snacks basket they offer and switch out every morning. Sucks as I don't like sweet things so nothing of the basket really curbed my hunger in the AM.
2) Bottled in the rooms smelled a bit old and plastic-y. Definitely been sitting there too long :(

overall though, the staff was really accommodating and parking is plentiful as I know some inns didn't offer lot parking.</Text><Rating>4</Rating><gmap_id>0x80ed3198194d8359:0xd0a100f566ae6355<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>If you're looking for service, I would keep looking.  The hotel is clean and of good quality but the staff is rude and apathetic about their client's experience.  At 1am a tow truck driver pulled into the parking lot to swap out a faulty rental vehicle for one of the tenants...1AM!  There was no staff on-site to prevent the truck driver from running the truck the entire time he dropped one vehicle and loaded another--about one hour.  All this time the truck beeped constantly while they worked.  For the rates they charge this is not acceptable.  When staff was notified in the morning it was as if they had not culpability what so ever.  I believe the Cambria Landings Inn does not understand the importance to the component of service in the hotel business.  I will not return to this hotel and I believe that there are other hotels in Cambria which do understand the importance of service, especially in providing a relaxing vacation destination and experience. Ugh!<//Text>< pics>

The mattresses need to be replaced. They sink in on both sides and it’s like you’re sleeping in a carved out hole. The fireplace hardly puts out any flames. The sheets had a big brown stain. The room is nice, and the view is perfection. The price is too high on the oceanfront rooms. It was almost $600 for 2 nights.</Text>

The room was great and staff was helpful. The carpet in the room was dirty, but everything else was clean and well maintained. It's right by the ocean. I was pretty upset that the picture I was shown before booking did not resemble the room at all. It also took a lot of exploring to find a restaurant that charged reasonable prices.< /Review>

The hotel was nice enough - with a wine tasting and cheese event each evening, but do not be mislead by the photos on booking sites.Having paid an extra £50 a night for a king ocean view, we expected a room similar to the ones displayed on the booking site. Instead, we got a room on the side of the building, overlooking a car park. The ocean is visible, but to see it, you have to go outside onto the balcony, which sits above the car park. (Dont dream of seeing the ocean from your bed, unless you are very lucky to get one of the rooms on the front of the building) - as far as I am concerned, we were given a partial ocean view room - and was therefore very annoyed at the 30% premium I paid for an ocean view room!Other than this, the rooms are nicely equipped and clean and the location is beautiful(although only 1 restaurant in walking distance) - I would recommend this hotel - buy only on a cheap deal - and never pay for the ocean view</text>

A overall nice hotel.  I had an ocean front king and I really enjoyed it.  Some signs of wear and tear in the room but was very clean.  Similarly priced for the area.  Friendly staff.  I would definitely return.< /Text>

We paid for a full ocean view but it is blocked by 2 very large bushes and cars park in front of the hotel all,day long.  The rooms are very small and old and not very clean. Our living door was broken so very hard to open.  Definitely not worth the money.  Very disappointed.</text>< pictures>

The  reason I book this hotel was because it had an outside patio. I specifically called the hotel to ask if we could sit outside enjoy the sunset and have dinner and wine on the patio. When we checked in our room was one of the few that did not have a patio.  We were not able to change to a different room. The hotel did not have air conditioning.<//review>

This used to be our favorite place to stay. They also used to be pet friendly and now they no longer allow pets. I will be finding a new favorite place. When we called to make reservations they were not polite at all.<//text>

Nice rooms across from the Cambria moonshine beach. They even have cheese and wine for guests from 5 to 7 which sets you in a good mood. The only minor negative is restaurant across which can be noisy and smelly if you try to sit on balcony to enjoy ocean view.</review>

<time>1517374828411< /time><rating>4<//rating><review>Good
- Excellent location
- Beautiful partial ocean view
- hot tub in the room
- fireplace was nice
- room was reasonably clean
- Keuerig machine, fridge and microwave in the room
- Room was wheelchair accessible
- Good, fast WiFi
- Complimentary wine and cheese every day at 5:30

Not so good:
- Room had a moisture smell, probably due to insufficient ventilation.
- Free breakfast consisted of a basket with one banana, two apples, oatmeal and trail mix. Not what I expected.
- The bathroom floor didn't have the right slope, so all the floor got wet when I took a shower
- TV image quality was awful. No HD and wrong aspect ratio. Watching TV was painful.
- Light dimmer was broken.
- Window had no screen.<//review>< Pictures>

Horrible experience! They switched our ocean view room and treated us like it was our problem. We had already driven 3 hours and chose to stay. Looking back we should have drove home. Where is the old management?? Seriously disappointed. And NO bottle of wine with new management.<//Review>

i was not informed that there was a hair dryer hidden in a bag on a closet shelf, was not informed that the key had to be inserted with the A facing down and it entered for only one day instead of 2, the most annoying thing was the fact that you could hear the water or toilet running every time someone used it loud enough to think it was in your room.< /Text>

Das war ein wunderbarer Aufenthalt! Das Hotel liegt direkt am Strand, das Personal war ausgesprochen freundlich und wir haben uns direkt wohl gefühlt. Die Zimmer sind groß, sauber und ansprechend eingerichtet. Es gab Cookies, Wein und Käse in der Lobby und Kaffee im 1. Stock for free. Absolute Empfehlung.</review>

<text>Die tolle Lage des Hotels ist unschlagbar! Die Zimmer sind in die Jahre gekommen und man hat keine Klimaanlage. Einfach das Fenster aufmachen und man hat eine frische Meeresbrise als alternative. Das Frühstück ist eher ein Zuckersnack der auf dem Zimmer serviert wird. Betten sind OK und man kann sehr gut eine Nacht verbringen. Der Strand vor der Tür und die Aussicht kompensiert vieles..<//text><user_name>Hotels.com reviewer<//user_name><Time>1406246400000</Time>< UserId.>

Sehr schönes Hotel an einem wunderschönen Ort. Die direkte Lage am wilden Strand von Cambria und die geschmackvolle Einrichtung des Hotels machen den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm. Das Personal ist freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit, am Nachmittag stehen Käse und Wein zur Verfügung und das Frühstück wird auf dem Zimmer serviert. Alles in allem sehr empfehlenswert, wir waren 2 Tage dort auf dér Reise von San Francisco nach San Diego und haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt.</review>

We were disappointed about the location of the room.  We were on the bottom floor and only had an ocean view when people were not parked in front of our room.   the traffic on the street was busy and loud.</Review>

Clean, well equipped and well maintained, efficient and helpful staff, reasonably priced and... Pretzels!
The Best on the Westside.
There's even a video camera to record your rehearsal..no extra charge.

Overall it's practically perfect. Inexpensive, decent equipment, there's parking on the roof (altho its usually full most of the time). Only thing thing I wish they had was fans in the rooms. It gets hot and sweaty in there sometimes especially if you're a drummer.</Review>

<Text>I advice ladies not to go here day or night guys. it's in an alley type area. i went when it was dark and it's true roaches comes with the package they need a pest and parking is terrible there. i would love to give two stars but one is good enough. do like i did and find somewhere else to go. i had to get my car fixed because their parking is horrible narrow and impossible the scratches on the wall should be proof im not the only one having that issue.< /Text>< pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1515292114774, 'text': "First of all,  the reviews posted by Jessica Morales, Jesse Martinez, and Michael Nunn are all being posted by  the same person.  With that in mind, I will post the same response on all 3 reviews.   So, here is the actual story.   This lady came in to see our rehearsal facility and to get a feel on if she would be happy rehearsing at our place.    She wanted to look at all of the rooms, which is perfectly fine, however when we informed her that some of the rooms are being used by other musicians, and we could not interrupt their rehearsals, she became incensed.  She felt that we should break in on people who are paying to use the rehearsal room, just to satisfy her needs.  Then after showing her, the rooms that were available for her to see, she said that she wanted to test the room.   We informed her that the rooms sound great,  and that we didn't have time to have her test the room.  We explained, politely and respectfully that it is not something we do.  She became a bit upset telling us that she's been to other studios that sounded bad, so she wanted to be sure that ours didn't sound bad too. Again, we apologized and told her, that we don't offer that service, explaining to her that our rooms were excellent.  She left, in a huff, and while backing out our parking lot, she hit the wall.  She then called us, when she got home, threatening to sue us, because she hit our wall, while she was driving her car.  As far as safety goes, we have been in business since 1988, and in that whole time, there has never been an incident involving our customers, or our employees.  If the last 30 years are an indicator, then we are located in an extremely safe area.  Lastly, just a random thought.  We live in an era where hate, anger, lack of respect, lack of humbleness etc, seems to be becoming the norm.  West L.A. Studios has been celebrating music, creativity, integrity, ethics of the highest degree, and a commitment to excellence in customer service, and in providing musicians with the highest quality equipment in a safe, clean, environment, with positive energy abounding.  I truly hope that this person can put herself in our shoes and understand that we don't always have time to set people up to test our rooms.  We are simply confident that when they get in our rooms, on their first rehearsal, that they will be very pleasantly surprised."}</Resp>< GmapID>

The friendliest, most helpful staff. Has seen LA musical history (look at the classic photos on the walls of past clients) has great gear, quiet soundproofed rooms, recording capabilities, a warm creative vibe, and a liberal early-arrive leave-late policy. and of course, pretzels.</review>

This place has *the* coziest and least expensive, highest quality studio rental spaces available on the Westside!

We're talking like $15–$30 an hour, including all of the fixings.</review>

Great studio, great people and plenty of amps. The rooms are clean and there is parking! Imagine that! If your local and you want to rehearse or even record and film, West LA Studios is a great option and should be seriously considered.<//Text>

My favorite studio I've been to so far in LA. Great prices and even better rooms. The stages are phenomenal and they allow you to record yourself for free. The rooms are all micd up, it's awesome. Good gear too if you don't have your own. The employees are really chill and helpful as well.<//Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>Wow! I just called to book studio space, and whoever answered the phone (older man voice) came off completely RUDE, and disgusting. I asked to book rehearsal space, and he asks for how long, so I tell him. He then says "no I don't have it but how many people are you working with? Confused, I asked if he has the space or not. He replies, "I don't have what you're looking for but what kind of rehearsal are you doing? I got kind of annoyed by the whole Dr Jekyll / Mr. Hyde act he seemed to have mastered and asked his name. Sounding offended he replies "what's YOUR name?" so I ask again and he just hangs up the phone. Sucks to be that guy.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1520903352466, 'text': 'WOW, IT\'S TRUE THAT NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED. So the phone rings, and I answer the call, very politely,  as I always do. A lady (with an elderly women\'s voice), asks if we have any openings at 8:30, this Wednesday. I ask how many hours.  After she responds,  I politely reply that we have nothing available. for that time, for those amount of hours.  I, knowing that there some other studios nearby, who might be able to accommodate her,  ask how big is her group, knowing that these  other nearby studios have rooms that are a bit smaller then ours, may not be able to accommodate a bigger group.  She then, in a curt tone, asks me if I have anything or not??  I replied that we don\'t but are. you having a big or small rehearsal?  She then, in a rude tone, doesn\'t answer my question, tying my hands to be able to determine if this alternate, nearby studio might be able to accommodate her group. and instead demands my name.  Me, somewhat frustrated, at this point, refuses to answer, but instead ask her, "What\'s your Name?"  Then she calls me an old jerk. I then hung up the phone.  SO, TO RECAP.

Guys do not go there day or night. Especially night this is a great spot for a stick up. My car got broken into driver side window and I was in such a hurry to get out it took forever. I was freaked out. Parking was horrible and not safe unfortunately for me not only do I have to get my car window fixed but the bumper too because it was horrible backing in back out super narrow. Don't go here it will cost so much money to get my car fixed. Guys trust me its not safe there. I went because of the reviews and I sadly hate myself for having a, "I have to see it for myself" kind of attitude. Scary place...

Also for the paranoid idiot that responded. I've never called about suing, I can get my own vehicle fixed. All I'm doing is telling the truth. So that must have been another upset customer. You must feel really stupid and guilty to think all bad reviews are from one person. Well in that case all these positive reviews are by one person. If it's dark and your window is broken, you'd be ready to leave in a panic but it doesn't stop the fact that your driveway and parking ruined alot of people vehicle and now you have customers who will speak up FYI I didn't run into a wall because I was in a hurry. I SCRAPPED against the wall because I kept backing in and out trying to exit from your super narrow parking structure. GUYS GO SEE FOR YOURSELF!!!! It's the truth but only a guilty mind would respond with such a long response and think that all negative reviews are by one person. It's ok u aren't going to always get great reviews and I've never mentioned anything in my post about looking at studios. As an artist I know not to interrupt another's artist session. Again u should take that issue up with other dissatisfied customers. If u are getting sued by someone then u should because a guilty mind never takes responsibility.<//text>

{'time': 1471327584504, 'text': 'To put it simply, our equipment is far from old.  Our P.A. Systems feature the latest and most technically advanced Mackie DL series,  digital mixers.  All of these were purchased new,  and installed in the last year.  Within the last 3 months, our 3 staged rooms have been upgraded, and now include brand new, state of the art, powered sub woofers.  All of our rooms have had brand new monitors installed, within the last 1 1/2 years.  Within the last year, we replaced all of our microphones with 45, brand new TC helicon Microphones, which are as good as any microphone out there.    Our drum sets are not only newer, but they are kept in spectacular condition.  Also, the cymbals we provide are pro level, and come at no extra charge.  We have worked hard, this last year, to install video cameras and video monitors, in our rooms, enabling our customers to film their rehearsals, at no extra charge.  Both the video cams and the monitors have been purchased new, and this is offered at no extra charge. The only "old" equipment that we provide is known as vintage equipment.  These are coveted and much more expensive guitar amplifiers, which are almost always preferred by professional guitarists. Most of our rooms have had new carpet installed, within the last couple of years.  When you walk into our lobby, the scent of fresh and free coffee tickles the nose.  I wish that I could respond to this review by saying I will work to improve these things, but the fact is that our equipment is state of the art.  Yes it\'s true, we do offer vintage guitar amps, but there is a big difference between old and vintage.   Nothing sounds sweeter then a vintage fender amp.'}<//Response>

It's okay here. Equipment is old, place smells a little, but they're helpful and it's usually not too loud with below average metal-heads like at AMP or other rehearsal places.</Text>

<review>i give this place one star. BECAUSE the older guy had an attitude, in a hurry, unattentive, and wouldn't let me hear how the equipment sound.
Customer service is key with any business IDC because people can always take their business else where. So not kool bro!

" Would you purchase a car before knowing if it runs well or if it has any defects you need to know about? NO!" I'm offering my business and i cant hear how the system sound was a deal breaker.

PARKING? Yeah they have it but no comment. See for yourself.

not a great place unless you are desperate.< /review>< resp>

Customer Service went out the window:( used to come every week before workers started making the place feel hostile. Oh well, on to the next. Thanks for the years!<//Review>

It's ugly, equipment is old but works, but it's still miles ahead of Amp< /review>
<Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1472275992744, 'text': 'To put it simply, our equipment is far from old. Our P.A. Systems feature the latest and most technically advanced Mackie DL series, digital mixers. All of these were purchased new, and installed in the last year. Within the last 3 months, our 3 staged rooms have been upgraded, and now include brand new, state of the art, powered sub woofers. All of our rooms have had brand new monitors installed, within the last 1 1/2 years. Within the last year, we replaced all of our microphones with 45, brand new TC helicon Microphones, which are as good as any microphone out there. Our drum sets are not only newer, but they are kept in spectacular condition. Also, the cymbals we provide are pro level, and come at no extra charge. We have worked hard, this last year, to install video cameras and video monitors, in our rooms, enabling our customers to film their rehearsals, at no extra charge. Both the video cams and the monitors have been purchased new, and this is offered at no extra charge. The only "old" equipment that we provide is known as vintage equipment. These are coveted and much more expensive guitar amplifiers, which are almost always preferred by professional guitarists. Most of our rooms have had new carpet installed, within the last couple of years. When you walk into our lobby, the scent of fresh and free coffee tickles the nose. I wish that I could respond to this review by saying I will work to improve these things, but the fact is that our equipment is state of the art. Yes it\'s true, we do offer vintage guitar amps, but there is a big difference between old and vintage. Nothing sounds sweeter then a vintage fender amp.  Additionally, the equipment works fine for Suicidal Tenancies, Ziggy Marly, Rose Royce, Young the Giant, Maroon Five, and many other of the finest acts around.'}<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2bb7577ffd127:0x5aa50e819667369< /GmapID></record>

<Date>1602002914217<//Date><rate>4<//rate><text>After taking to social media, the company reached out and settled the claim. I dont think it should have to come to this for them to do the right thing, but in the end they made it right.

We went through the horrific event of having our 4-year-old pup lose his ability to walk on his hind legs.  he went from happy to partially paralyzed  within a matter of hours.
We have only had our pup for 8 months, both he and his sister were rescues from the shelter.  We got them in January 2020 on a Sunday and took them Monday for their health check-up.  Both passed with flying colors. They have regular check-ups and all their shots.
So when "Buddy" fell ill, we immediately drove him to the animal hospital and got him in to see a physician.  We knew it wouldn't be cheap, he was paralyzed, and we knew that we also had Nationwide Insurance. We sent him under the knife and prayed that he would recover.
The good news is that he is recovery marvelously.  The Bad news is that we have been getting nothing but a runaround from Nationwide.  The first thing they asked us "if you only had the dog 8 months why would you spend so much to fix him?" of course I was astonished that someone could be so heartless.  My answer is if it were a person would you ask why they bought health insurance for their adopted child and why would their family put them in the hospital for a needed operation within 8 months of adopting them?
We sent over everything in an itemized document from both our local vet and the hospital that did the surgery.  They have asked us repeatedly for the same information that was sent originally.  We sent over an email with 8 attachments and we have received 6 requests for information that are in the original email.   Now they have waited over 1 month with no contact while they review the claim.  That is after the immediate denial of the claim, to which we called and asked why and they said they don't have all the information.  which began the constant resending of the first email until now with everything they need in hand - they have gone silent.<//text>< Pics>

<text>Worst pet insurance ever!

Submitted a reimbursement last August and received the refund this April. Just before our policy expired! Such a coincidence! I guess we got the refund because Nationwide staff realized that they forgot our claim when they reviewed our insurance policy and wanted a renewal.

Additionally, like other reviews, before we finally got our money back, Nationwide also sent us a letter to inform us they needed additional 30 days to make the decision on our claim each month.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>I saw Google had good reviews of Nationwide Pet Insurance so I ended up buying this insurance for my pet.  I got the whole pet with wellness plan.  Turns out they deny or pay you only for certain things.  They end up saying it’s a pre-existing condition which it really isn’t.  Now I am waiting for another claim for 2 months and haven’t heard anything yet.  I reached out to Social Media and now they say they will get back to me in 2 days.   I also had to get medical records.  They will not get the records like other pet insurance companies do.  I saw Yelp reviews and they were horrible.  And now I am seeing bad reviews here on Google.  I wish I would have know how bad this insurance is.  I will go back to my previous pet insurance as they are way better then Nationwide.  I don’t have car or home insurance through Nationwide but with them being not responsive and not paying back, I will definitely never have any kind of policy through them.</text><Rate>1< /Rate><gmap_id>0x80dcd45d7693672f:0xf963d2cfc6c65f70</gmap_id>< Pics>

<text>Nationwide has made it very difficult to process claims.  Documents submitted are not reviewed in a timely manner leaving unprocessed claims opened and subject to more medical record review.  I have waited 6 months for previous claims to be closed.  Not worth the money.  I would not recommend Nationwide, look into Paws Insurance- I've heard better reviews about them.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>I waited a long time to write this review. When I first enrolled in this plan through my employer I was very scared due to all of the terrible reviews I’ve read. I’m almost two years into my plan and here is the deal:

The insurance pays all of the claims my pets are eligible for. (I have 4 insured dogs). They don’t cover preexisting conditions that’s why you should get insurance as soon as you get your dog. Even if that dog has a problem, you are not aware of it meaning you will be covered.

It used to take 4 weeks to receive a response on my claims now I get the funds within 5 business days. What’s not to like?

I have two elderly dogs and one of them undergoing a lot of testing costing $1000s. After we met our deductible of $250, Nationwide is paying 90% or everything. I am happy customer.</Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Buyer beware! This company determined that an emergency c-section was a pre existing condition. Which makes zero sense. Thus refused to pay/reimburse any of my vet bills. The claim and reimbursement process is a nightmare, took them 8 months to deny my claim. They also tripled my premium without notifying me because one vet accidentally put my dog was a pure breed and not a mix breed. Overall a huge waste of $700+ and an absolute headache. Don’t use Nationwide pet insurance, they will rip you off.</Review>

25% premium increase in one year.

I started my policy in 2014 when the company was VPI Pet Insurance.  Nationwide bought them out a few years ago, and their price increases have been outragious.  This year's premium increased by 25% over last year.  If this continues, I won't be able to afford the policy when my dogs get older and really need it.

Also, they will not prequalify claims.  You have to pay upfront, and then they will decide if they are going to reimbuse you after you have already taken on the risk.  While they have been good at paying, it is a risk I have to take with every pet bill I authorize.

My suggestion:  Find another company.< /Text>

<text>Terrible. Payed only 30% of our emergency hospital bills.
I got a puppy from a breeder. When he was 14 weeks old, he got problems immediately after his planned vaccination: he went lethargic and was not able to sit or drink. We spent 3 days in urgent care and hospital and puppy was treated against muscular weakness. Thank God, the puppy fully recovered after 2 weeks.
Nationwide agreed to pay 30% of our bills after deductible, because they somehow decided that puppy had a “Systemic Allergic Reaction”, however he was never treated against any allergy. Also, Allergic Reaction does not have muscular weakness (or myopathy) as a symptom.
We have a Major Medical plan with pet wellness, but Nationwide told us that it does not cover hospital stay for allergy reaction sickness. And again, puppy was never treated against allergy because (we asked doctors!) hospital and urgent care did not see a reason for that.
Also, the Nationwide website gives a misleading information. Site states, that they cover injures, hospitalization, exams, lab tests, but in the end, they did not cover even a doctor expertise in the hospital.<//text><date>1596982101589<//date><Response>None</Response><Rate>1<//Rate><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

<Review>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. I would give 0 stars if I could. This is the worst company for pet insurance. I regret ever giving ONE PENNY to this company. Long story short, they don't even recognize my cat's breed (Scottish Straight) and they're constantly changing his breed to Scottish Fold. HE'S NOT A FOLD. They change it without my permission and I constantly have to call them to have it changed to Domestic Short Hair. Folds tend to have more health problems, that's why Nationwide keeps filing him as one. They find any and every excuse to exclude EVERYTHING from your policy. And when you fight to have stuff removed they find another thing to tack on. Part of that issue was I was going to a vet who didn't even know what a Scottish Fold/Straight was, so they were reporting FALSE information to Nationwide. But as a PET INSURANCE COMPANY they should KNOW THE BREEDS AND KNOW WHEN THEY'RE BEING GIVEN FALSE INFORMATION. Since then, I switched to a vet who KNOWS MY CAT'S BREED and gave him a COMPLETE BILL OF "PERFECT" HEALTH. Well my Nationwide policy was up for renewal, and I called to upgrade (because you can only upgrade at the time of renewal) because I want to get regular dental cleanings done on my cat to PREVENT DISEASE, and they denied my request because my cat his LIVER ISSUES?! No vet has EVER told me my cat has liver issues. I immediately called my vet's office to ask why they said that and they said A) they have NO RECORD OF EVER EVEN SPEAKING TO NATIONWIDE PET INSURANCE and B) have NO RECORD OF MY CAT EVER HAVING ANY LIVER ISSUES. Nationwide Pet Insurance is a fraudulent/scam of a company. My cat's breeder has also switched all of her pets off of Nationwide Pet Insurance to Trupanion, and she hasn't had ONE issue. I will be following her lead and switching as well. Nationwide Pet Insurance also has HORRIBLE customer services response times. I can't tell you how many time I've emailed and it takes 3-5 business days to get a response. Also, when I called to renew/upgrade, the guy I spoke with asked me a series of questions, and said they would have to submit a request for the upgrade. My cat has NONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE ASKED. The guy told me he would call me back when he heard about my request. He NEVER CALLED BACK. I called today (a week later) and the woman tells me "a voicemail was left" which is a lie because I don't have a VM from them at all. They didn't bother sending me any correspondence either concerning the supposed "liver issues." DO NOT USE NATIONWIDE PET INSURANCE. DO NOT USE NATIONWIDE PET INSURANCE. DO NOT USE NATIONWIDE PET INSURANCE. DO NOT USE NATIONWIDE PET INSURANCE. DO NOT USE NATIONWIDE PET INSURANCE. I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH.</Review><Rate>1</Rate><Gmap_id>0x80dcd45d7693672f:0xf963d2cfc6c65f70</Gmap_id>< Name>

As the dog got older, the price continued to rise ( now up to $75+ monthly and it seems that less and less is covered).  It has certainly proved disappointing. I think it would be okay if something catastrophic happens, but not a good purchase for normal maintenance.</review>< pictures>

<time>1585339657044<//time><Text>Absolute horrible company. I insured five of my animals with them and asked for a full underwriting review of each one before buying a policy. I was told the underwriting review was done and was informed of all of the possible pre-existing conditions that might be excluded. I was satisfied with that outcome so I purchased the policies. I purchased the top-level policies that covered literally everything. They are not cheap. Of course almost immediately Nationwide started refusing to honor claims, stating that they needed to review medical history. They got claims mixed up and attributed claims to the wrong dog. They said the underwriting review had never actually been done and that had just been lip-service on the part of the sales team. I told them that was absolutely unacceptable and was basically fraud, and they said "even if you were misled, that doesn't change the fact that we need to review records." WOW. I am absolutely livid and I can't believe they think they are going to get away with this kind of fraudulent sales tactic.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dcd45d7693672f:0xf963d2cfc6c65f70< /gmap_id>< user_name>

<text>I had registered my puppy with Nationwide - as my older dog has been with them for over 2 years and I had been happy with his policy

Nationwide, however, no longer offers the same policy that my 2 yr old has. The closest one they offer covers less in terms of Vet services. So, I accepted it and paid for the first and last month fees.

She has had 2 claims sent it for basic illness services (hot spots and yeast infection) and it has been over 30 days that I have been waiting for her claims to be REVIEWED. Now I received a notice that it will take an additional 30 days.

I have called four times about the delay with the claims and finally cancelled my policy today and will be going with another company.

It is clear that the sales agents are doing a great job selling your policies, but are you losing new customers like me?

Apparently, your phone reps are not trained to show any empathy or interest and only told to sound upbeat and friendly.

Never once did a phone customer service rep apologize for the delay and say she understood how frustrating it must and how she valued me as a Customer.

Never once did a phone customer service rep ask me how my puppy was doing.

In fact, when I canceled my account this morning, all the rep said was “have a nice day” after reading off legal terms from the contract.

They sound like happy robots that don’t realize that their job is related to caring for our animal companions.< /text>< user_name>

Horrible!!! Mistake on my part to stay with  Nationwide. The original company vpi was great. Nationwide not only raise my premium and decided to Payless for my claims. But now say that I have benefit caps. In few words Nationwide wants to denied any claim possible. But they want that monthly payment. Please as a long time pet owner don't waste your money with them . Look for other insurance that might be better. Not sure how Payton Manning can endorsed a greedy company. ALSO many of the reviews are done by their employees. Really !!! Great company to work for and great employees. That's what some reviews stated.</text>

<review>03/15/2021 Update:
Could be 4 stars but recently they "forgot" my online account and I had to go through a rather cumbersome process of creating a new one. Other then that - at some point they started paying  most of my claims, so despite a very rough start - I can say it's a reasonable option
Original 1-star review:
Fraud! they will never pay!
I submitted my first claim 5 month ago and since then i'm fighting with Nationwide Pet Insurance and NEVER got a cent from them. They will keep asking more documents from you and vets you have visited and they will keep reviewing your claims (now there are 4 of them pending) forever, each time finding a new reason for a delay< /review>< pictures>

My 7-pound maltipoo Daisy has been insured by VPI-Nationwide since she was rescued in 2006. She's approximately 15 years old and has had medical problems for the last 4 years... enlarged heart, gastrointestinal disease, hypertension and glaucoma. Her Major Medical Plan with $100 annual deducible has worked effortlessly with direct deposits and no questions asked. Nationwide should really be thankful that Daisy has been fairly healthy most of her life and very few claims. Her premium however is skyrocketing and kind of wished I self-insured after the 10 year mark.... would've had thousands saved for the rest of her life.<//text>

Thank goodness for pet insurance! I've had Nationwide since 2006 (it was VPI/Veterinary Pet Insurance) and thus far have been satisfied. When I got a second dog I chose them again, even after shopping around to make sure nothing better has come along. The claim filing is easy, and payments are made within a reasonable amount of time.< /Review>

Nationwide Pet Insurance has been a life saver for my dog who was diagnosed at the age of 4 with lymphoma. They have paid 90% of every claim submitted in a timely manner. I see many complaints written because people did not read and research the coverage options and choose wisely. This company is very transparent with any exclusions for each pet. Customer service is readily available and always helpful. I highly recommend the whole pet with wellness coverage which pays a percentage for actual costs incurred. THANK YOU NATIONWIDE!</Text>

Have had no issues with VPI thus far, so they get a 5 star rating from me! Granted, my dog only qualified for the basic insurance because of his pre-existing health conditions. But so far so good...<//text>

Pet insurance...? Who would have known that this would be such a great investment for my dog. I actually signed up for Nationwides pet insurance because my shitzu got really sick and I had to pay over$600 out of pocket. Now I just pay my monthly premium and if my dog ever needs surgery or anything, I pay my deductible and Nationwide covers up to $10,000! (Most definitely worth it.) Their customer service is always excellent and their prices are competitive.<//review>

Nationwide’s Pet Insurance offers many plans with varying levels of coverage. My dog is covered by their highest level plan, so only pre-existing conditions will not be covered. We have used this pet insurance for two years (our dog is now two years old). She was a rescue from a shelter as a 10 week old puppy, so when we started the insurance we just thought “oh this will be smart- there’s lots of expenses the first year with vaccinations, and puppies tend to eat things they shouldn’t.” It has turned out to be such a great thing that we signed up! Our dog’s whole first year was one weird medical issue after another. To name a few: weird painful wart like thing on her paw, broken premolar requiring surgical removal, skin infection leading to balding, kennel cough, lots and lots of worms, food sensitivities requiring prescription food, ear infection, eye allergies.... this sounds like a lot, and it was! Being born a stray, we think she just had a very poor immune system and just couldn’t catch a break. Our pet insurance plan did exactly what it claimed it would- we received 90% back on ALL of our claims! We did have to send in records for review to Nationwide at one point, and the review was somewhat lengthy, but then they continued to reimburse us. That first year we definitely got our money’s worth, and will continue using the insurance for years to come. Now our dog is very healthy and hasn’t had any claims for quite a while, but after seeing how the veterinary costs add up so quickly it’s definitely worth it to us to know our best friend has coverage and we can always do what we need to in order to take care of her.<//review>

This should be the new slogan. I am new to this insurance and yet I have tasted all the unlimited time for processing our new claim. And the result is decline or incomplete. Like I am getting subsidized Medicare or Obamacare insurance. I am paying the most expensive premium they offer and yet they treated me like I am getting a welfare or food stamps for my dog. I will canceled this as soon as I am done with putting the review on the yelp.</Review><time>1557618395687<//time>< Pics>

<review>This place is an absolute joke. I was a client for many years and didn't file a single claim. However, that did not stop them for raising my rate every month. They raise your rates behind your back without notifying you of any changes. Before I knew it I was paying well over $55 a month for a perfectly healthy and maintained 4 year old dog. I have given them over $3000 since being a client but don't think that gets you,any credit regarding their awful customer service.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Nope. I called this morning to inquire about coverage for parrots. The price for two large birds was 28.77,  with a 50$ deductible per incident. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. The rep on the phone told me they cover 100% of the benefits allowed OR the vet visit, which ever one is less. Then I asked for more details and was directed to their benefits page, ( how much they pay for each test/condition). Each itemized price is about 10% of what a vet actually charges, not only that, but, their coverage is FAR FAR less than what they offer for cats and dogs in both services covered and amounts FOR those services. ALL exotic vets (and yes birds are considered exotic) charge higher rates than cat/ dog vets. They also don't offer coverage for well visits and annual physicals/ check ups. What they do offer is a measly portion to put towards those, such as 35$ towards a CBC, when my avain vet charges around 200$, 7$ each towards a wing or nail clip, 65$ at the vets. I won't be using this company.< /text>

< Review>
This pet insurance is one giant scam. You pay all the money for not only the emergency plan but also the health and wellness plan and they take two months to evaluate a routine health and wellness teeth cleaning and then deny it because it's "a pre-existing condition" yes having teeth that need cleaning is a pre-existing condition that is not covered under the health and wellness plan.

Then when your pet has an emergency you take them to the ER and they STILL don't reimburse your claim because the two separate ER visits were less than the deductible even though together they almost double the deductible.

This company will string you along for MONTHS if you let them just taking your monthly payment no problem when they have no intention on giving you what you're paying for.

TERRIBLE.<//Review>

<text>I have held Nationwide (formerly Veterinary Pet Insurance) for all three of my dogs for the last 25 years.  I have nothing but high praise for this company and the coverage they provide. This company, the staff, and the benefits are top notch!  The claim submission process could not be easier.  Human insurance could learn a lot from Nationwide!  After meeting the yearly deductible we are reimbursed at least 80% of our expenses.  I never want to be in the position of losing a dog because the veterinary costs are too high.  With Nationwide, that will never, ever happen.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>So far I have had this insurance for 3+ months for my new puppy. I have been pleased with the response and turn around time for reimbursement. It took about 5-7 days.  It was only wellness checks and vaccines. They do however have a set limit on how much they will pay for certain things. But so do other insurance companies. I am glad I didn't read these disgruntled postings before I took out my insurance.< /Text>< name>

I've had the illness/accident combo insurance policy for my furbaby for over 5 years now and those first couple of years, the company (VPI) was AMAZING with really fast turn around times. VPI was a 5 star! Now that Nationwide has taken over, that same quality of expedient service seems to have been greatly compromised.  We have a current claim stuck in "processing" status (the first I've filed in a few years), so I may amend this  rating yet again if we don't see positive movement soon.</review>< pics>

got the insurance sounded great. after the insurance went into effect, i took my pets in to the vet. i submitted my claim then they requested pets records. after they had told me records weren't needed. got my pets records then had to wait 60 days.  they find any reason to not to reimburse you.

also dont use your insurance right away or they will request records and other bs. you have to wait 4 month so that you don't have to wait for review and other bs.  also when getting nationwide insurance tell them your dog has never seen the vet anywhere.< /text>

I am reading all these reviews before signing up for this insurance. I don't think I'll be moving forward with this company. One thing is consistent, however: The "owner's" responses are indeed cookie cutter and annoying. How could anyone take her responses seriously? I'm sorry the majority of you have had such bad experiences with this company. I do thank you for being upfront and honest. You have definitely helped me in my decision.</text>

<Text>I am putting a two star review because I am very frustrated with how my claim process has been going.
In November my husband signed up for pet insurance. Our dog doesn't have any pre-existing condition. The policy went into effect on Jan 1, 2018. Our dog had a stomach obstruction/GI issue on Jan 6, 2018 which was a Saturday and our vets office was closed. We took him to an emergency room when he was showing signs that were troublesome. While at the ER they told us they needed to take x-rays and we immediately pulled up our policy to see if we would be covered. (as this can be a rather large expense). Upon review, we found that we should be covered and went ahead with the x-rays. The vet determined that our dog needed to stay overnight for monitoring, which was an additonal cost.
Once the ordeal was over, we submitted the claim. Two weeks later we received a message via the online portal (and in the mail a few days later) indicating that we needed to submit medical records. I submitted the records that same day (1/23/2018) and called the next day to confirm that Nationwide had received. They had. They told me it would be 30 days for them to review.
As we are approaching the 30 day mark (two days from now), I have wondered why this is an issue that is taking so long. If Nationwide isn't asking me for more information or calling my vet with questions, why would this take so long? So, I called to talk to a rep. The rep told me a few things: 1) Anytime a request comes in so close to the policy going into effect, Nationwide gets concerned that the policy is being abused. (WE SIGNED UP IN NOVEMBER WELL BEFORE KNOWING THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN) 2) Nationwide has sent a letter in the mail (not one via their online portal that they have used for every other communication), which I haven't received yet, telling me that as of 2/14/2018, they need another 30 days to review the medical records. (Why? I have no idea. Again, they are not asking ME for any other information, nor have they contacted my regular or ER vet in the almost 30 days they have already had) and 3) I was then told that all of my other claims that I have submitted since the first one are on hold until the medical records are reviewed. The other claims I submitted had nothing to do with the issue on Jan 6, yet I am having to wait on them to be resolved. I have received NO communication about that being something Nationwide would do.
I am just very frustrated with this process and it appears, through online reviews, that I am not the only one. I have asked to speak to managers and claim reviewers and have been told no. I would really like to know how to get some answers so that I can figure out what is taking so long.< /Text><Time>1519249140851</Time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Well to start off with the company used to be called VPI.  My wife and I had our golden insurered for the last 13 years.  First off should have left sometime ago but didn’t because our dog was diagnosed with Addison’s.  No other company would take do to pre existing conditions.  I’m going to make this short. A few weeks ago our dog needed surgery for a hemotoma cost $1,100.  Submitted the claim form got back only $300. They claimed it was for allergies!!! For which is was not.  After reading their letter it was quite evident they went out of there way so they didn’t have to pay. So after 13 with them I dropped them not worth $90 a month save the money..  oh buy the way before I got off the phone with there rep who did not care that we were longtime customers I told her that I would write a review.

I wish I had looked at these reviewes before signing up. Nationwide Pet claims on their website that they cover most pet desease and then after you commit and make a payment send you tons of papers with fine lines of hundreds of major deceases and accidenta that they do not cover. I have filed a complaint with California Dept of Insurance.</Text>

< Review>
I've been a customer of VPI for 14 years, insuring both of my dogs with them. Throughout the years I've paid both policies on time and only had minor increases from year to year. Once Nationwide stepped in I saw our rates shoot up over 50% in one year. When I contacted them I received a cookie cutter response without any justification for the increase, probably because they know you cant justify 50% in one year.  They didn't offer any solution for a long time customer, but told me to contact the Department of Insurance.

I had pet insurance for past years paying around 34 a month. Their reimbursement for the claim was 9 dollars (for amount of >400). They did same thing last time my pet got sick! I could’ve saved more by myself for their treatment, rather than donating these rich ass company by hard earned money. I don’t recommend this insurance to anyone.< /text>

I don't understand all the complaints.  I have had VPI/Nationwide for the 5 years I have owned my rescue poodle.  I have always received prompt and courteous responses and payment for each of my claims.  I have surprisingly received 100% of my expenses for my "baby".  I have the lowest plan which now for an 8-year old dog is abut $650/year.  I have received notice that she has reached the max for the year for her stomach illnesses which occur when she eats chocolate, chicken bones, etc.  I have no problem with that.  I am trying to be more careful.  She jumps on the kitchen counter when we are not at home.  I am using the Scatmat to keep her off the counters.   I highly recommend to anyone with pets to sign up with Nationwide.< /Text>

They will try to get out of paying your claims in the same manner a trashy low-life restaurant patron would try to get out of paying their tab. They will pay for stuff in the beginning but when it comes down to a real claim for a surgery or whatnot they will flat out deny even if you are entitled to it, knowing 9/10 people won't sue. If you have been a victim of this or any other pet insurance company, make sure you file a complaint with the BBB and AG because if they have enough complaints the government will take action against them.  Also be sure to take them to small claims or civil court.<//Review>

<Text>Absolutely awful. And stupid me--for continuing with them for 6 years when I knew, I just knew their coverage was horrible. I paid extra for their top policy and yet, they covered.....NOTHING, except for a few little things. I kept them in case i needed them for something huge with my beloved dog, but they do not covered something huge and then, then, to insult me, they raised my rates from $48 a month to $66.65 with NO warning. I called to find out more and dealt with an extremely rude woman who gave me the run around. I finally canceled--and ran their their many hoops to do so. I would never ever use this company again. Never.< /Text><rate>1< /rate><user_name>Karen Anne Mahoney</user_name><response>{'time': 1459873823767, 'text': "Hi Karen,\n\nI apologize that you have been disappointed with your experience.

<review>I paid for VPI Pet Insurance through my employer (J&J) for about ten months prior to my dog being diagnosed with cancer.  He was only seven, but the center of life for our family.  As any pet owner can relate, we were devastated by the diagnosis.
We racked up several thousand dollars in Vet bills before finally conceding to mother nature.  One of the hardest decisions we've EVER had to make, as you can imagine.  Our only comfort was that we had VPI.  Or so we thought...  They refused to cover almost every expense for one ridiculous reason or another.  Through many calls and contacts (over a number of months) by both us and our Vet, VPI continually pointed to obscure clauses in the policy to avoid paying anything!
After submitting about $10K in veterinary costs, VPI reimbursed us for about $300!!  Don't make the same mistake we did, thinking these money grubbing SOBs will do anything other than protect their financial interests.  If I could give less than one star, I would.  Steer clear of VPI/Nationwide at all costs, please!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

My experience with VPI has been a good one.  I have ferrets and this is the only company that covers them.  Contrary to a lot of opinions I feel VPI IS very worth it.  I have had it for several years and even with my premiums I have been reimbursed more than I have put out for the policies.
Unfortunately a lot of things are not covered but the things that ARE covered makes the policy very much worth having. Thank you VPI<//Text>

So far have not had an issue. They just recently added the whole pet with wellness coverage which is a 90/10 policy with policy year deductibles (either $100 or $250). It gets away from the pesky FFS (fee for Service) scheduled fee rate charts and will reimburse 90% of charges after deductible. It also adds on the wellness coverage that covers vaccinations, flea/heartworm prevention, tick prevention, etc. Now that they have added the email the claims form option, I have had no issues with them receiving my claims forms. I get an email telling me they received it within hours of sending. Plus they process them within 2 days.< /Review>

I had VPI pet insurance for many years. I believe since my dog was 2 years old. He is now 11 and he needs knee surgery I was informed by the vet. I called VPI to see what was covered and they said NOTHING!!! Since his condition is hereditary. Very disappointed since I've been paying approximately $42 a month for years. Could have put the money away in an account just for my doggie's medical expenses. I will be cancelling this insurance and take my chances.<//Review>

<response>None< /response><text>I'm a Healthy Paws customer and checking quotes  for cost savings to add a new dog  Nationwides site grossly misrepresented what Healthy Paws offers compared to their plans. The information they provided when comparing is wrong and would make someone go with Nationwide if they didnt know any better. Because of this misreprentation, i would never go with unethical company who portrays the competition in a less favorable light with lies.

For the record Healthy Paws offers EVERYTHING Nationwide Pet does except wellness visits. I used to be a VPI customer until they cheated me out of reibursements that their policy said they would pay. 2 bad companies merged into one. Do your due diligence before committing to any company.

I pay $51 a monthwith Healthy Paws for 90% coverage and a $100 deductible. They pay my claims within 5 days at most. I choose the vet and treatment. No yearly or lifetime maximums. They also give multipet discounts too.

Nationwides wellness has a $250 deductible. After shelling out $192 premiums for a year it would be cheaper to pay out of pocket for a yearly wellnesd check.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>1< /Rate>< name>

< review>
Take the money you would pay monthly for this insurance and put it in a savings account for your pet - you will be much better served (my vet suggested this when I first got the policy. I should have listened). I obtained this insurance for my dog when he was about a year and a half old. He did have a couple of pre-existing conditions for which I did not expect coverage (torn ACL in back leg and food allergies). I had this insurance for 3 1/2 years and Nationwide/VPI has declined both claims I have made for my dog's veterinary needs to one of the two pre-existing issues (yes, my dog is quite healthy and I have made only two claims). As a side note, when you want to dispute a claim, they make it incredibly hard and time consuming to do so.

Most recently, I received notification from Nationwide two months ago informing me that my payment option was expiring (credit card) and that if I did not update the information, my policy would lapse. I purposely did not update the information because I had decided I did not want the policy anymore (no payment was taken in April as expected.) Nationwide somehow found a way around the need for my updated information and began charging me again in May and June. I discovered the payments just after the June payment was deducted (the new charge had a 30% increase as well!) I immediately called them to find out how this happened and ask for a refund. The customer service representative simply said that they kept re-submitting the charge until the bank finally accepted it. I then explained that based on the information they sent me, I purposely did not update my information because I wanted the policy to lapse and I would like a refund. After a bunch of policy quoting and run around, I got no where except to have my policy cancelled as of today. If I want to attempt to receive a refund for the charges in May & June, I need to write a letter and provide supporting documentation to get it.

This organization has demonstrated to me at each turn that the only thing that matters is the almighty dollar and they are going to do everything they can to obtain and keep the money they received from their customers. I strongly recommend that you do not choose this provider.</review>

I have been with VPI for MANY years and raved about them to everyone with a dog. One of my labs has allergies and needs meds to control her itching. VPI always paid for all her meds throughout the year. Nationwide only paid $63 of the $362 I submitted and said she has hit the max they will pay for the year. That leaves me with 8 months of no coverage. Now that it will be considered a preexisting condition with any other insurance company, I'm screwed but I'll be damned if I'll continue to pay premiums to a company that screws over their loyal customers. I miss VPI. But since they became Nationwide the amount they pay on claims has dropped dramatically. Five minutes ago I cancelled both policies on both dogs. DO NOT BOTHER GETTING INSURANCE THROUGH NATIONWIDE. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!< /Text>

I had Nationwide auto and home insurance for the past 11 years ,  was happy with them until we enrolled  our  1 year old golden retriever we have been LIED to by OMAR OAZZA dishonest and pure con artist .. He cost us endless headaches and unnecessary wasted time, money and false information . He failed  tell us about the benefit schedule or anything about it .
we will be filing a complain about him in the department of insurance .

DON'T BUY FROM nationwide pet insurance look somewhere else .</Review>

< Review>
All the good things about Persian cuisine, they decided to be generous on.
They didn't decide to cut corners with the food and I grew up with Persian food. I wish this place existed when I went to Cal Poly because there really isn't any other genuinely good and high quality Persian food until Los Angeles! Owner is a spectacular host as well.</Review>

<Review>Restaurant was not crowded. We both ordered soltani .. the barg kabob was very tender. Our meal was delayed a bit since owner had arm injury but they brought us appetizer of kashk bademjoon on the house and the owner stopped by our table to make sure we enjoyed our meal. The house dough is delicious.
Wishing him quick healing🙏<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>5<//Rate><UserId.>104291695894763859284<//UserId.><time>1621739694834</time>< name>

This place is a GEM on the central coast. The food is authentic, the service is quick, and the staff is warm with a great attitude. Their indoor and outdoor tables are lovely. This is the only real Iranian food I’ve found in the central coast.</text>

<review>The Persians were roadbuilders, linking ancient Africa, Africa and Asia through their road system.
Now DarWish restaurant builds a direct link from the intricate Persian cuisine of the Middle East directly to the central coast of California for all to enjoy!<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>First visit here. Haven't had much experience with Persian food so I can't compare with other places but for the most part it was good. The Paneer Sabzi appetizer was not what I expected. There were no tomatoes or scallions like the menu advertised. I was surprised how long it took to get a dish that required no cooking. And overpriced at $5.99, but the Feta cheese was amazing. The Bademjoon stew was tasty and very comfort food. And the basmati rice with saffron was heavenly. The Chicken Kodeh wrap was good, but could've used a little more of the "sauce". The Olovieh sandwich was pretty much the same as the wrap except stuffed with potato salad. The saffron pistachio ice cream was yummy. Service was friendly, but again the food took awhile. Good thing we had time for a leisurely lunch. Will be returning to try dinner in the future.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
Nastiest food me and my husband have ever tasted. We ordered the barib kabob and it didn't taste like steak it tasted like potted beef from a can. We also ordered the ash-e-reshthe soup and it wasn't soup. When we told grubhub they told the restaurant well the owner made a point to call me and then proceed to tell me that I dont know what good food is because he "never gets complaints. So not only was it bad food it was bad customer service. Never ever eating here again. I wish I can give it zero stars 55 dollars of food that made me ill.< /Review>

I am waiting at the restaurant while they make my food and I saw that no one in the kitchen is wearing masks or gloves. Especially during COVID it’s not safe or sanitary to be cooking in the kitchen like that. We came here because the food reviews were good but am disappointed in how they’re handling sanitation!< /Review>

As of this COVID-19 post, open for takeout and outside dining. First timer who really enjoyed my meal; a variety of flavors on our plates from the Mediterranean/Persian menu. Highly recommend, will definitely return!</text>

Good authentic Persian cuisine. Big colorful  portions, good helpful service.
Hummus was good, served with sliced carrots and flour tortillas?? Tadig crunchy rice, was on the greasy side. Chicken Soltani Kabobs, is one big grilled kabob of turmeric marinaded chicken breast, and one grilled kabob of ground chicken, served  with a grilled Roma tomatoe, chili pepper and rice for $22.
<very small wine list, BYO.< /Review>

I was actually in shock by how bad the special soup and the stew I ordered was.. I usually love this type of food but I can’t say I would ever give it another chance. For reference, I am the least picky eater and willing to try anything and usually enjoy most things. But this was awful... sorry..</text>

Wow! We passed by Grover Beach from Monterey and had lunch at this little gem.  Well priced and DELICIOUS food! The owner himself prepared our filet mignon, ground beef and chicken on a bed of  fluffy jasmine rice with grilled tomato/Anaheim pepper and a wonderful cucumber salad. We topped it off with hot and crispy falafel. My first experience with Persian food and I was not disappointed. The service was outstanding (given the current Covid restrictions) and super friendly staff. I highly recommend this great place!</Text>

I just visited here with my cousins.  We all ordered different plates and we all loved it. The food here is really good.  I had the hummus aappetizer.  Very good.  Nice and garlicky the way I love.  I had the lamb shank with rice.  The lamb was so delicious and tender. My rice was really good too.  The staff at the restaurant were genuinely friendly.</review>

Appetizers are awesome and good quantity.
All main courses are good especially the rice plates with.
Hummus, falafel and Greek salad is perfect if you are gluten or vegan fan.
Desserts are finger licking good. We liked jolebi  and the small round sweet pods. (Forgot their name).
This is a great place to take a break from usual pizza, pasta and breakfast food.</Review><user>113991524486511012071</user><Date>1577948915687<//Date><Pics>None</Pics></record>

My friend and I dined here a few weeks ago on a Saturday night. We got seated quickly and were in for a treat because we got this server from the heavens named Tiffany. She took such good care of us throughout the meal, giving us a soup sample and explaining everything about our food. It made the experience that much more immersive and delectable since we’d never eaten Persian food before. Every time she came by, she was super sweet, bubbly, and funny, and made us laugh and I even saw her sitting at another table to take their order as they all chat together. She is the prime of restaurant service and I wish I had more Tiffanys on my meals out—it’d make all my food taste so much better! On our way out; she got the door for us and admired the moon with us too. She is absolutely precious and amazing. I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again because it was just a visit back to my college town, but I hope and know she will be superb wherever she is.</review>

I had the Gheimeh Bademjan: the eggplant in it was very good and the flavor overall was nice, though I wish the split peas were a tiny bit softer. Partner got the lamb shank, which was perfectly seasoned and came right off the bone. The kabobs served here are decently sized, so even just having one would seem filling enough. Was kind of annoyed that a lot of dishes seemed to be unavailable, especially the Zoolbia Bamieh that I would have really loved to try. We got the saffron ice cream instead, which was still quite delicious and different. Our server was very sweet and attentive, though she seemed a bit nervous/anxious and quiet. Prices lean on the more expensive side, but having a Persian restaurant here is very nice and I'd like to try out more of the menu, so I'll definitely be coming back again.</Text>

<Text>The food was excellent! I was a little hesitant at first since I had never had Persian food before, but my coworker suggested the chicken soltani kabob or the beef soltani kabob. Both were great!! We also has the hummus and their classic Tadig (crunch rice) with stew on top.
The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu!
I definitely recommend this place!!< /Text>< Pics>

Sooo good! I had never had Persian food before, and it was phenomenal!  The waitress was attentive and personable,  and the other guy (host? Owner? ) who was working there was also very sweet and friendly.  I got a delicious chicken entre, and my companion got the Shish Kabob, and both were so good! Such a great evening! Thank you!</Text>

<Text>1. Vegan hell, 2. Dangerous for allergic people due to neglicence and crosscontamination, 3. Dirty.
The waiter Josef had black dirt under the fingernails. The restaurant was half swept and everywhere where piles of dust that they have not yet swept up yet. We, a party of five, called ahead.to ask for vegan options, which they assured they have. Once there we ordered several things and underlined anew everything MUST absolutely be vegan due to allergies. The very first dish that comes, the lentil soup - has meat on the bottom. We were furious and left immediately. They assured us that normally they cook the lentil soup meatfree and that they have no idea how it got in. Even worse! How do they not have under control that huge chunks of one dish land in another dish...? I can only imagine the hygienic standards in that kitchen! Gross!< /Text><rating>1<//rating></record>

<review>We ordered a couple of the party platters as we were having guests, so we got to try several types of kabob, tadig, hummus and dolmeh. Everything we had was delicious! My personal favorite was the beef koobideh. Well worth the money, and without the drive to L.A.! The owner and staff were all friendly and welcoming. Can’t wait to go back soon!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Attempts to deliver a cultural cuisine, of  poor quality, without a savory taste.
The Greek type salad almost tasteless arrived with canned cut olives on iceberg type lettuce with a few tiny pieces of welcomed Persian cukes and under ripe slices of tomato.  The eggplant appetizer came without a bread to spread it on, and it wasn't very tasty, bland. The main dish was a sweet chicken "stew ", more like a puree to eat with a plate of white rice. I've eaten better persian/turkish/Greek food elsewhere as to.state our palates know good Mediterranean/persosn food. Oh, the lentil soup was tasteless, how can a cook not.make it savory?  The attitude of the owner/manager was surprising too, as he was very negative about his business.
Maybe this was a bad day for the restaurant,  but I had eagerly awaited sampling the menu. If the owner/manager would welcome his customers as they arrive (we were the only ones there) and have explanations about the entress or a sampling plate, this would lend interest. I have travelled and lived all over the middle east, but have not experienced such a disinterested staff and blamd ess to the meal.< /text>

<Text>The food is as authentic as you could ask for and the owner is very personable and friendly! They have some very traditional dishes and all very well prepared. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised to see a new restaurant open that wasn't BBQ or Mexican food (thank goodness) and finally see some outside culture established in this area!! If you want a new fresh taste be sure to stop by and give them a visit. You will not be disappointed!

I would recommend the 32 slice pizza which is named La Gigante (which is called The Gigantic One) to my middleclass(not from the hood) buddies. 🙈</text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Ordered a pizza which was delivered an hour and a half after the 45 minute wait time they said it would take. They left for delivery but driver couldn’t find our house and they state I didn’t provide the right number but on my confirmation email all my info is correct. They redelivered the pizza after saying they would remake for us since it’s been awhile since our pizza was made and fresh, they lied. They redelivered the same cold pizza! When I called all they could say was “sorry”. I’m new to the area so I guess I have to live and learn and I most definitely learned to NOT order from here again.< /text><user_id>101273363004700376622<//user_id><username>Kendall Love< /username></record>

<Text>This is the 2nd time I order. I completely forgot why it has taken me so long to order from this place, but I remembered why when I called back on my 2nd time ordering and asking how much longer they were going to take on my order. They have failed in eta when placing an order. Both times they have taken over an hour from the time of me placing my order. Their food is great but their service rating, specially delivery time is horrible!<//Text><Date>1571541741370</Date>< Response>

The crust was good the sauce and cheese all combine melting in my mouth with deliciousness. Every slice had all the toppings I asked and the slices were all the same size, the pizza overall was very well executed. Don't get me started with the soft chewy great flavored buttery breadsticks that made a fantastic party in my mouth. Very satisfy. The price was fair and the delivery guy was very nice and polite. Delivery was fast. Keep up the good work!!! Beats all the other big chain pizza companies. Ordering again.</text>

I was hungry and in the mood for some pizza, I ordered all pepperoni with half ham, when I got there, they added pineapple to the half, reordered the pizza and now I got half pepperoni and half ham. Really guys? Is it that hard to work at a pizza joint? What's wrong with this location?? Could you please step it up? It's  our hard earned money we spend here. Also the pasta was watery. You guys earned this one, thanks. :(<//Text>

<Review>I would give no stars but that option is not available, took, called in the order got there in 20 minutes and I still had to wait another 30 minutes for 1 pizza. Then they charge me and after that they tell me they did not have the toppongs I asked for and if I wanted to wait another 20 they would do it for me. Each topping is 3 dollars with 25 cents and they only returned me 3 dollars. If I gave them 3 for a topping they would want the 25 cents. worst pizza Loca< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Comes in handy when you wanna feed a lot of people. I haven't been there in months and was upset that prices went up but I suppose it's still a better alternative for large amounts of people< /Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>Do they deserve 3 stars ???? It took over 1 1/2 hours for my delivery. To be completely honest, I am pretty sure that they are understaff,  running the store on a skeleton crew.  I placed my order online and it was fast and easy. After 50 minutes of waiting for my delivery I called twice.  I must say that I got good customer service. Well the young lady was not rude nor hang up on me. I was the one that was pretty upset.  Delivery lady (in 60s I think) was rather disappointed that I was not the celebrity she expected to find. (Lol) The pizza was a warm and a bit on the dry side, but the chicken wings were great.  Will I ever order again ??? Lets just say I will be giving them a second chance. I just hope they keep their word and give me my due credit.< /text>< Name>

So I ordered pizza at this place through phone call, i got the around the time to pick up the pizza. Waited patiently to mention my order and phone number just to find out they never registered my order. And the funny thing is they checked my phone if it was the right number and the call went through in their phone. So sketchy and unprofessional. Next time I'll stick to Domino's.<//text>

They took for ever to have my order ready about 40 minutes. When I asked them if my order was about ready I had to repeat the whole order again it was as if they had no idea what I was taking about. When I finally got my order I was already so angry that I just took it as I was putting everything is my car I notice I got  no sauces which I paid for by the way. So went back and got it he asked to see my receipt again rudely; so I am walking back with the sauces and I realize they did not give me my sodas I go back and I let him know I didn't receive the sodas for which he says " are you sure? " I was so annoyed by then I said yes and had to show my receipt once again. I am only giving it a 2 stars because the food was fine; But the customer service is lacking alot.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The manager refused to accept any responsibility for her employees she just told him to go inside and have a seat really ???

Pick up order

The pizza was done in a fashionable fast paced had alot of cheese on it and didn't go easy on the pineapple! The wings on the other hand lacked sauce since I ordered barbecue sauce on them

The staff was low they only had 2 people there and the female that took my order couldn't hear me well considering they had a big fan on where no people sat< /Text>

<text>Place an order online , the invoice stated that the order would be ready for Pick-Up at 7:19pm , showed up at 7:20 and still waited 5 minutes in the lobby. My order wasn’t even started at the time that I showed up and they claim that the invoice had barely got to their system. They would notice orders coming in if they weren’t in the back chatting away . They wanted me to still wait around for them to come around and start the order .<//text>< userid>

the food taste good but what i don't like about it is that when you want to make an order by phone they make you wait for a long time. once i went in front of the store and called by cell phone the guy pick up the phone and told me if i could wait i said "o.k." but he was talking to the girls inside the store it wasn't even busy and he made me wait for a long time just for that heck of i waited, and i end up waiting for over five minutes.i'm not ever going to make an order by phone the employees make you wait for nothing,but then again the food is good but i recommend to order pizza somewhere else :-(</text>

Why is it taking more than 30 mins for ONE large pepperoni pizza? Are they like waiting for a shipment of dough or what?? This place is terrible. i came here because its near my home. i couldve gone to lil cesars and back 3x already. Their pizza isnt even that great anymore like it used to be. no more pizza loca for me. this place is so run down by the way, it should be no surprise the day they go out of business. did i mention the customer service is non-existent??

This place doesn't even deserve a star is my first time ordering here and I place my order at 7:40 and the lady came to deliver it until 9:00pm I was already coming back from eating in a close by taco stand and the lady still gives me a bad attitude because I didn't pay for it what a joke !!! Worst delivery service I have ever deal with.</Text>

<review>This weekend I stopped by this 99 Cent Only Store on my way to work. I noticed they had fresh produce, and summer supplies in the parking lot. It was a relief to find all my summer necessities at a budget friendly store. Moreover, their organizational skills are exquisite, it was supper easy to find items. I was impressed to find a 99 Cent store with such a high quality. Highly recommend them, friendly staff.

P.s. they have variation of balloons, colorful flowers, and party goods. Very budget friendly and clean.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

From the moment I walked in to finishing my shopping... EVERYONE...and I DO mean EVERYONE was VERY Helpful, Courteous and Friendly. I ended up buying a shopping cart full of stuff. Great prices!
Also, the store was well kept and stocked.
Much appreciated!!!
BTW... EVERYONE was wearing a 😷.</text>

< Review>
This store has an abundance of different items! Unfortunately not everything is "99 cents only" but it's not a surprise due to our increasing tax economy. Lots of toys and pet items and so much candy and sweet treats to choose from! The parking is somewhat limited so you might opt to street park. Frozen foods and even fresh bread and produce. Friendly staff is always a bonus!<//Review>

Not disinfecting through out  store no hand sanitizers for clients to clean hand rails of the food carts or their hands if needed, not  showing that they are disinfecting food carts people are using over and over the used carts without cleaning after use  Aren’t they suppose to be cleaning something around Repeatedly. They need to have  hand sanitizers throughout store.  And this store is open to public this is how the poor get overwhelmed with sickness’s and diseases, by not following the rules and not enough city inspectors.   This business not using cdc compliance rules.< /text>

They have a lot of things now that are more than $0.99. So just be careful to look for the label for things that cost more.
Plenty of free parking.
Lots of variety. Pretty good produce.< /Text>

I love this 99 cent store, I have score some major finds in here, sometimes they have specialty products or one time finds, freezer is well stocked, nice selection of home goods, the produce is a bit "Meehh" but you can still find good veggies.   I found A1 Steak sauce here for a buck! and a full gallon of Dryer's chocolate ice cream for a dollar as well.   Not bad.</Review>

Average prices Before they use to have better items and cheaper prices. Now some things cost more than $1. But for basic emergency needs like napkins, plates, sodas, etc. School supplies are a pretty good price, though. Sometimes they want to charge a lot like for 18 eggs like $2 which is a lot.< /text>

I used to love shopping here, but the owner of this store keeps changing things around in ways that make no sense.

-For instance, the produce area is now IN FRONT of the fridge, creating a huge gridlock of people. There are always so many people in the way that I can't get to the vegetables I need, and it's often impossible to get around them all.

-This store also got RID of the AIR CONDITIONING, I have beads of sweat going down my forehead as I shop now.

-Finally, they also got rid of many of the shopping carts, leaving only 10 or so available to customers.<//Text>

Buy it when you see it! I always find food selections here. Like a treasure hunt you have to walk the isles, they dont put the good stuff out on display like general stores.

This 9th has a really good location. Parking is always easy and there is plenty and they have great variety of product. The attendandt are always open to help you find things in the store and the numbering and labeling of the aisle allows for easy and fast finding of items. They also have restrooms so if you ever need to.<//Review>

Everytime I go there I go for a certain thing and I end up with a million things. Good stuff for cheap . Wondering if the Disney makeup brushes on stock right now</Review>

< review>
Had the worst experience ever here today....it wasn't the store itself or the employees it was the people shopping there. So very many rude customers, cut in front of you, bump into you, giving you looks like your crazy, almost pushing you out of the way to get to where they want, no one says 'excuse me' ... I wasn't raised that way. Then in the parking lot some lady called my husband & I white devils in spanish, he heard her I didn't, for no reason at all other than we are white, we were just walking to the car, unbelievable!!! Then some idiot proceeded to park so close to my car I could barely get in, then some man was waiting for my spot and some latina cut him off to take the spot and didn't want to move so I could get out, by then I had lost it...again, thankfully I was raised right. So upset & angry I left crying. This is a nice store, it's these kind of people that ruin it,  Since I've moved out here I have experienced a lot of racism towards myself, my husband, & my kids. Really unhappy about that. 😢 I unfortunately can't shop here again, not worth it.<//review>

< Review>
I like the store sometimes,it's never stocked, empty shelves all the time, employee's can't help me , they don't speak English, when asking for certain things, they say no or see I say can you show me and they say no cause I think they don't understand when I ask them when I ask for an cold items, they just smile and say ok, its a shame I have to shop  elsewhere,I  know many people who stopped shopping there too ,I like the 99 cent stores but theres  just no communication< /Review>
