<Text>Came to grand casino with some friends on a whim thanks to their enormous outdoor seating area and it ended up being quite a pleasant surprise! We had originally planned on just having a beer but their happy hour food specials sounded too good to pass up. We ordered sweet potato fries, a sort of cheese/meat plate, and an empanada. All were delicious and great prices during happy hour but to be honest even their regular menu doesn’t seem too spendy. Our waitress was helpful and personable and still was able to be attentive while they got busier. Regardless of the time this seems like a wonderful place to get some Argentinian food and look forward to going in and grabbing some things from the bakery next time.< /Text>< Rating>

<text>Their breakfast burritos are EVERYTHING! Like someone truly puts their heart and soul into those tortillas. And their empanadas, and their almond croissants, and their muffins... which are most of what I’ve had there so far.

It’s a bit unassuming, but if you go once, you’ll keep coming back. Great service, great food, honestly fantastic prices, too.

Again, can’t reiterate enough... get the breakfast burrito! I’ve had a few from around the culver area and this one is it.<//text>< user_name>

I was visiting the Culver City farmers market today and saw that they had a little booth outside their bakery near the other vendors. So after we got done with the market, we went to get their baked empanadas.

They were really pretty and looked delicious, so I got four kinds: two spinach artichoke, spicy beef, tomato basil and chicken & mushroom.

I liked the spinach one but the chicken and beef were really disappointing. I also got some sprinkle cookies and shortbread cookies and was overcharged because the woman at the register actually dropped one of the cookies from her tongs and didn't notice that it had fallen. So I was short one but no big deal, I didn't want my daughter eating two cookies anyway. *Shrug* Shortbread cookies were decent, nice and buttery.

Overall, customer service was good, friendly but I probably would not revisit.<//review>

<text>Grand Casino is THE Argentinian place to hit up. If you're nostalgic for dulce de leche or alfajores - this is the spot. They also do themed cookies for all the holidays! They are always open and tend to be the only open spot early in the AM here in downtown Culver City.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2ba29f54a807f:0x944152ae03467281</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Today I Tried some Argentinian Empanadas, I tried one Ham & Cheese and two with meat.
It was decent, they were not the best I've tried. There wasn't enough cheese in the Ham & cheese and there wasn't enough meat.
But I will like to try something else on their menu next time.< /text>

< review>
This family-owned café is one of my favorites in all of Los Angeles, and I love getting to support small, local businesses. I found this place when I moved to the local neighborhood back in 2016. Their savory empanadas are incredible; I usually get the spicy beef. Delicious. I frequently go here for breakfast or brunch. The huevos rancheros are my favorite! They also serve Groundworks coffee. The prices are very competitive in a city like LA, and they remain one of the most affordable restaurants in downtown Culver City. During the pandemic, they have put out some nice outdoor seating, expanding into Main Street, with plenty of space between tables—it feels very safe. Sometimes, I have just gone down there to sit and enjoy a coffee and pastry in a nice, peaceful setting. I highly recommend and will continue to be a regular patron here.< /review>

I know this place is already famous, but my oh my, their egg tart is a bomb!!! Seriously, the best egg tart I ever had! I went there on a holiday so the line up was OK. I think I waited about 20min or so around 6pm. Every layer of pastry crust is crispy and their filling is just about right sweetness with egg flavor. I don't know why I only got 4....I'm definitely getting one box of dozen when i go back.</review>

Ham and cheese empanadas are heaven. The crust is perfect. The lemon merengue tart reminds me of my mom's baking.< /Review>

I like their spinach empanadas! However, If you are planning to go there it would be best to  take Venice Blvd find parking and walk to Grand Casino. Also you could park in the public parking lot across the movie theater on Culver Blvd and walk because Main Street is totally blocked for now and part of Culver Blvd as well.< /review>

Baked goods were delicious (cookie, donuts, eclair). Gets busy pretty quickly so you will have to wait a couple of minutes before ordering. Espresso was perfect. I've heard breakfast here is delicious-- have yet to experience it myself, but I plan on returning soon to try it.< /Text>

So happy this place opened up right next door!! Great food, coffee, ice cream, juices. Awesome breakfast spot. It's expensive and super hipster-y, but I'll take it as it's the only place in this area to get breakfast and coffee. The olive oil eggs are my favorite!! Sooo good.<//text>

Ordered a cafe late that was made to perfection (I am usually not a fan of latte but felt the urge to try it with all the great reviews).  I also saw that they have tango classes so I will definitely come back to try out the class.<//review>

This is the best place for fresh sandwiches. I do miss Ms. Lydia.
Great atmosphere and very reasonable prices. The cakes are just out of this world.
It is lime a second home to me.

<time>1473630317123< /time><Review>This place is great. There is an eating area outside just off the sidewalk that's fresh, clean and ideal for summer lounging. The interior decor is no nonsense, comfortable and has a warm atmosphere that is something out of old school films. Menu selection is small but the food is very good if rarely great... This is no dig plus I'm a bit hard to please. The service is sometimes great and sometimes it is a bit of an afterthought but they are always friendly which makes up for a lot. I recommend their prosciutto and cheese plate as an appetizer or the mushroom soup. Bread is free, usually fresh and always delicious.<//Review>< user>

< Review>
Not a single gluten free item and proud of it. When I inquired after options I was simply told, "This is a bakery". Apparently, they didn't get the memo. Not the one about gluten free but the one about customer service. Luckily, there's two gluten free BAKERIES within a block and many other places offering service with a smile. The Americano was pretty good, however, it was served up in a dirty cup.< /Review>

I bought a 4 leches cake and it was dry. I’m so disappointed to have spend $35 on a cake we didn’t like. I thought it was going to be good because I always buy pastries and bread here. I hope you guys do something about it.< /review>

food is 4 star (maybe 5 for what it is?), service is 2 star.
some of the workers are much more service oriented than others.. just get the food and get out, or else you might want to flip a table.< /review>

<text>Vegans wouldn't be happy here, as nothing they produce fulfills the vegan-friendly diet. The bakery is delicious, though. I've never seen flies around as one of the reviews said...The staff is also friendly, and even made change for me so I could get some quarters to do laundry.</text>< Pics>

<review>I ordered 3 1/4-sheet cakes for an office event. They were huge! Beautifully done and delicious. The prices were reasonable. I've also been to the regular bakery several times and love their empanadas. They have a huge variety of cookies, too. I've never actually been into the restaurant part, just the bakery. When I went to pick up my cakes early Friday morning, I locked my keys in the car and the "regulars" sitting around outside with their coffees were very nice and helpful.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Grand Casino is a hidden gem in Culver City on Main Street.  It has the feel of a European sidewalk cafe.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  Breakfasts are wonderful.  The Huevos Rancheros is one of the best I've had and that includes Tia Sophia's in Santa Fe, NM.  Cafe Lates are great.  Have always had an enjoyable, delicious meal here.</review><rate>5</rate>< userid>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>My friends and I came here for lunch and it was a beautiful day to be in the outdoor area enjoying lunch. Unfortunately it was a bit of an odd meal in terms of service and food quality. It had a higher end feel being there so it was nice to be in, but we thought the service and food would reflect that. Our server would disappear for a while, messed up some of our orders and some things were just lacking on flavor. I got a chicken chimichurri sandwich and there wasn't much chimichurri sauce on there at all and salad didn't come with dressing and server was gone for too long to even ask. Others had either messed up meals or they were lacking anything special too, but still felt nice to be here. The bread from their bakery on the sandwich was great and we got some bakery treats after that were really good. I agree with others that you should come here for bakery items, not so much the meal.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I had the cheese and spinach empanadas here, not the greatest empanadas, I would say Okayish!! They were a little harder from outside and very greasy even though baked. Service is really good, also we had the bottomless mimosas, cant really go wrong with the mimosas though.<//text>

<review>Hate is bad; but DISLIKED is the right word for my experience at Grand Casino. My Iced-tea came with the unusual COCKROACH GARNISH ( instead of lime or mint). The employee's way of handling the issue was as bad as the GARNISH itself.  I was asked if " the garnish was already there" implying that I'd put it there myself.  Shame on you Grand Casino!!!!<//review><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

I used to like coming here but the Grand Casino is now crap. We ordered a dozen facturas and a dozen empanadas and they were VERY small and FLAT! The empanadas HARDLY even had any filling! Not to mention that they only gave us 11 empanadas not the 12 we ordered and paid for. On top of this the lady who attended us was SO RUDE despite the fact that we were the only ones ordering. She also hastly dumped the facturas inside the box. I would not recommend this place to anyone who want to be treated with respect and eat good facturas, empanadas, or any other pastries.</text>

If you want to try the Argentinian version of a macaron, you need to try their ALFAJORES!

The alfajores have a dulce de leche (caramel-like) filling that is REALLY YUMMY! They are soft and slightly chewy, but the texture is just right. I can guarantee that you can't just have one because you'll want more!

You can grab a box of Alfajores ($4.45 for a dozen). I've bought a few boxes for a potluck at work and everyone LOVED them!

They also sell a big version of their alfajores or ones dipped in chocolate. And they have other pastries such as muffins, cookies, danishes, and empanadas.

Their empanadas are pretty good too! Fairly small but fresh and all handmade.

I also tried a Large Vanilla Latte ($3.75) and it was ok. Not strong enough for me.

One day I will have to walk over here and try their brunch menu which looks pretty good.

For parking, you can try parking at one of the meters or park in one of the Culver City lots at along Culver Blvd and Watseka, or Cardiff or Ince (on Washington & Culver) where you can park for 2 hours for free!.</review>< pictures>

The quality is far away from the real Argentine panaderia (bakery) and overpriced, it may seem OK for the average US customer but not for a native Argentinean.</review>

(Translated by Google) Very expensive prices
The ugly lounge
Dirty bathrooms
Excellent waitress attention
Cook from what I could see from the outside
Very dirty
The presentation of the plate 5 points
The dirty and unpainted lounge floor
Bad lighting
If I were a Health Department inspector I put letter H and Plausuro

Came here for a youthful glowing skin class. The technician who taught us was awesome. She gave us lots of info of each step on how to double cleanse and pamper skin. Highly recommended. She's not pushing us to purchase anything. On the contrary, she was willing to provide samples for us to try them out first to see if we would have allergic reaction.</review>

This is an amazing place if you want to look better you should check in there. It will give you some free samples so you can see how magical their products actually are. Many of them are quite affordable as well. I have removed the dark circles from under my eyes and my face is moisturized. I look 20 years younger<//review>

Upon arrival for my mini Halloween makeup session, I was warmly greeted by Shirley. She was pleasant, efficient, and described every step of the eye shadow application process -- requiring many layers and blending. Shirley provided options, education, and did a fantastic job with my smokey eyes! Sephora's makeup service is absolutely convenient and I will return for future events based on this delightful experience.</Text>

From all Sephora stores in SF, the Union store is the nicest branch with a competent staff who can provide helpful recommendations to customers. In other stores, associates usually judge customers by look and actions before offering help and service.< /Text>

I keep trying to give this place a chance but get smacked down every time.  Each time I try to reach out, I am left feeling like I should have known better then  to call and ask for an appointment with "them!" Staff are snooty. Never have available spots for services, and do nothing to encourage repeat customers. More times a disappointment then a joy.</Review>

Terrible store, I was accused of stealing blush when I wasn’t just because I ‘wasn’t holding it right’. The workers followed me around because I was wearing baggy clothing, and they were standing in front of the door all in a circle gossiping about me. If it wasn’t for my mom and my sister they probably wouldn’t have let me leave the store.<//review>

< Review>
Angels sing in harmony each time I walk thru the fragrant doors of Sephora. Suddenly I have friends with perfect makeup and dressed in all black, carting around priceless pouches containing makeup brushes and beauty blenders. They all have perfect eyelashes and eyebrows to die for. After spending not enough time yet more than enough money, I'll leave with a feeling of hope and happiness. Which eventually turns into regret and buyer's remorse. If it's overwhelming, it gives me a justified  reason to venture back to hear those angels sing and gossip with my pseudo friends because Sephora has a super friendly return policy. Return or exchange anything as long as it's not more than halfway used. And if im not mistaken, there is no specific time restrictions either. Even if you lost the packaging or the receipt, they can look up your purchase with your beauty membership and exchange away! Make sure you check your email for any possible discounts or perks that you may not otherwise be aware of if you are a member. But im sure you already knew this ;) If I could live in Sephora, I would live at Sephora.</Review>

<review>This sephora was a horrible experience. When employees get suspicious of a person, just by their appearance, they’re often rude. They sit around and talk, and if you ask them to help, they either 1, ignore you, or 2, take the least amount of time for you. They talk about customers behind the
if backs, and follow young girls that are just there to shop around. Very disappointed. Rude staff, after letting two girls go that did not have any stolen items, they followed them out of the store. The two girls were followed, and the worker did not return until 20 min later. She had stalked them. That is entirely inappropriate.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Great place to go for high end make up and specialty beauty cases. I have sensitive skin so it's great that they have so many organic and toxin free products. What's great about buying beauty products here is that you can try on everything before you buy and if it doesn't work for you when you get home, they have a really great return policy. The staff is very helpful and will consult with you, but given that everyone has a different level of knowledge and preference for products, the advice you receive can vary greatly.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

By far the worst Sephora in the city. I asked for help with my brows and was told that they don't do the 15 minute makeover like all other Sephora do. But there was a lady getting help with her lips at one of the mirrors and a Sephora employee was helping her. So what was wrong with my request? Horrible horrible customer service!< /text>

< Review>
This is my favorite Sephora in the city. It never seems to be too crowded. But now I particularly recommended it after I booked a makeover for my friend. The reservation covered 45 minutes but they went above and beyond for my friend, who has never applied makeup before in her life. She has unique features of her face that they took into account and really helped educate her. And like every Sephora you can get great quality cosmetics in a variety of price points. Should you choose to skip the $12 mascara, hey, there's a Walgreens down the street.</Review>

<Review>Beware of Debra ! The staff is horrible. They kept bouncing me to each other to help pick makeup, and finally a woman named Debra made me pick all darker shades of lancome against my choice and now i end up looking 2 shades darker with this make up after spending a fortune !< /Review>< pics>

A little dirt never hurt nobody. Great place. Gets a bit crowded but still a good time to watch the races and have a good time. Recommend not dressing fancy cause it does get real dusty.</review>

Metro BMX In Bakersfield, CA. is one of the best tracks we have ever been to.  We have been to two different BMX races there, both large, and were totally impressed.  The track is very well maintained, not only before and after races but during the races as well.  The surrounding areas for spectators and vendors is being watered down and swept continuously during races to keep the dust levels at a minimum.
The staff is extremely helpful, whether it be in person or via Facebook and/or Messenger.  There is a huge area designated for camping which is clean and definitely fun for everyone.<//text>

My family and I eat from here very often; excellent food and service. We recommend the thin slice steak beef, chicken, and seafood pho. The shrimp and pork vermicelli noodles, as well as the fresh spring rolls, are also yummy. All reasonably priced.<//review>

I walked in to a very clean and comfortable and good essence in the air. I was quickly sat down and attended very quickly also. Great and helpful customer service at all times we were asked if anything else was needed to make our meal more enticing. The amount of food was a healthy serving so no complaints there left a happy camper. A great spot to eat I totally will visit them again.<//review>

They lagged on meats but man they made up in flavor. This is possibly the best one out here so far in Salinas, Ca. Flavor is great price is on point and they have a variety of options to pick from, from a menu that u can understand. Decor good handicap access great. Parking available and can fit a big party. The lady is so nice and there customer service is great. I love that she pushes the appetizer. Thats right mam go get it. Will come again for sure when i travel by.</text>

I love the size of their fat noodles in their soup. The strawberry shakes are good to. We've been here a dozen times and love everything they have on their menu.</Text>

I usually love coming here for to-go, but today I was very disappointed. I accidentally ordered #1 but I wasn't wearing my glasses, and quickly told the lady I actually meant that I wanted to order #7 within less than a minute. The lady ignored me and threw a fit, turned to finish making someone's drink while yelling, and making her drink with so much anger. Throwing ice in the blender, etc. I was standing there in shock and while she finally let me pay she started to press the numbers on her calculator while yelling once again. They only had 3 tables, so I dont think it was necessary of her to be stressed or take it out on me. I thought i mightve been overexaggerating but her face said otherwise. I don't think I'll be coming anytime soon and I am saddened to have felt so uncomfortable for simply ordering the wrong thing.

Don't get me wrong, the other times I've came here her other coworkers are always nice.</Text>

<Text>I feel the food is a bit too weak on traditional Vietnamese flavors. This is understandable since very few of their customers are Vietnamese. Otherwise, it's a good place to have reasonably priced, Americanized Vietnamese food.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Friday, May 17, 2019

Location:
1940 N Main St, Salinas, CA 93906

PARKING:
Plenty of free parking.

ADA:
ADA parking at front door.
Looks like nearly all tables are wheelchair accessible.

BATHROOMS:
Bathrooms are clean.
No foul odors.

FOOD:
Menu is quite complete.
This is a Viet Namese Restaurant.
Don't expect to find other Asian items on the menu.
The food looks and tastes like the food served to me in Viet Nam.

Portions are ample.
You'll not walk away hungry.
Unless you are a glutton.

Prices are reasonable.

This is a great place to lunch or enjoy a casual dinner with your Sweetheart.
Nothing formal here.
T-shirt, shorts and sandals are welcome here.

Staff is pleasant.
They understand and speak English well.
However, they've an Asian ear for language.
In my case, the waitress misunderstood white rice for fried rice.

I'll return, and recommend this restaurant to my beautiful Sleeping Beauty.<//Review>< Pics>

Food was excellent but the staff was lacking. Smaller portions than I'm used to. Had to wait for hostess to get back from break to be seated.</Review>

<text>Great Baseball park only if it had a playground for the children that r not playing a sport there at least put one in for the children that cannot sit an watch a game at least they have something to do for themself them poor little ones that wish they can swing or slide down merry-go-round to see a smile on their little faces would be amazing to the Parents well lets just wait & see if Los Banos has the funds for that cause they sure don't have it for all the holes in the streets to be fix they are just waiting for some one to get hurt then they will really loose out on something they say they don't have Good Luck Children in Los Banos!!!!< /text>< Pics>

<text>I went to the "New Vic Theatre," a totally redone version of an old downtown building with lots of history. What a pleasure! Each comfortable seat had a great view of the stage and is placed so that each row is low enough that people's heads don't block your view. The lecture was excellent and the sound quality good enough to hear the speaker. I'll be back!</text>< pictures>

Beautiful theatre and brilliant production. We have watched a couple of shows there when visiting family in Santa Barbara. Loved the atmosphere and the productions are to a brilliant standard.</review>

<pics>None< /pics><text>Handsomely redecorated, the low key new theater makes the experience a couple of notches better than it was at the old ensemble theater. It's a beautiful venue. The New Vic is well located near downtown Santa Barbara, with multiple restaurants nearby making it a good theatrical evening out in Santa Barbara. The choice of plays is generally more substantial than those playing at the Granada.

The cast and acting is certainly not up to Broadway standards, but this particular play (Everything Illuminated) picked up after the intermission, before which I nearly fell asleep. It is about search for an old Ukranian woman who saved the main character's Jewish grandfather during the Holocaust. The main theme was moving, especially, a soliloquy by the old man. Two other subplots were virtually unintelligible to me.</text><Date>1555169818585<//Date>< Rating>

<review>Great little theatre. It's hard to imagine there is a bad seat in the house. It's a fairly small theatre but that gives it a nice intimate quality. It is very nicely renovated. There is a small patio where you could enjoy some refreshments prior to the show but not a lot of seating. The theatre itself is in a great location, no lack of food or drink near by.<//review>< Rating>

<text>Great Little Theater. There isn't a bad seat in the house. Can't wait to go again. There are plenty of places in the area to grab a drink or something to eat beforehand. which I would do because the selection at the theater is minimal. There is a little outdoor patio area but it is quite small.< /text><UserId.>116435887860524638260</UserId.>< Resp>

The theatre itself is very nice, although parking can be difficult to find. Although the actors and set were great, the play we watched was a little boring, repetitive, and lacked a strong plot. I probably wouldn't see another play from them again,  but that could just be me.< /text>

<text>Mark is the best! I would recommend him 100% for any short cut, though I can't speak for women's cuts. I wouldn't go to anyone else in the area. He is hilarious, excellent at his work, and you can't beat the quality for the price. And he's pretty much a one-man business supporting his daughter's college education (his wife cuts on some mornings). I cannot emphasize enough, I love my cut every time and I always leave with a smile on my face.</text>< pics>

CASH ONLY BTW. Mark is the owner and only barber there and sometimes his wife Rose is there. He does it just how I like and in a timely manner and tries to get to you as fast as he can when he's busy with appointments. Very friendly. His wife does female hair and styling I believe too but this is just a guy's preference review so keep that in mind for females. If you're thinking of going on a weekend I would recommend calling because he gets very busy.</text>

Ive been going to this place for years! You could not meet a nicer man than the owner Mark. He has cut my hair through many diffrent styles. I have always been happy with his work. Honestly i used to jump from barber to barber hating each cut i got. But Mark has been cutting my hair for over 5yrs now and I finally have a regular spot that i know ill be happy with once I leave.<//review>

Clean, quiet, good parking! Park boulevard. My hair stylist just relocated there. My 1st time was today. I really enjoyed the vibe. She is not a braider but weaves, cuts, natural hair, press, flat iron and colorist. Formally, of Dolls Weave Bar. I shall be back< /review>

<Review>Best hair cut place ever!  Mark is super experienced and can do anyone’s hair. Price is totally reasonable, in fact, a steal for what you get from Mark who has a of of experience and mad skills.  I’ve been coming here for years and have never been disappointed.  Can’t imagine going anywhere else!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Mark is the best. Gives you a quality cut and with twice the friendliness as other shops. You can tell by the way he greets everyone by first name when they walk in< /Review>

Mark is a great hairstylist and really nice guy. I am new to the Lake Merritt area and did a little research on the internet and thought I'd give Empress Hair Styling a try. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised. I went in there with a couple images of hairstyles off the internet that I was trying to emulate.... Mark knocked it out of the park! He cut my curly hair really well and gave me a super clean fade that comes with 25 years of experience! The man is a talented hair cutter and I will definitely be back in a month for another go round! Highly recommended and very reasonably priced!< /review>

<Text>Mark knows my hair better than I do, I always like his haircuts.  Definitely worth trying if you're looking for someplace new, I've been coming back for 2 years and don't plan on going anywhere else.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great little spot to eat in Carlsbad.
Lovely ambiance, with quality furniture, good music, and wonderful ceramic mugs you can buy!
The serving staff was quick, attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about attractions in the area.
Further, their food is excellent and very filling!
Excited to come back here again in the future!</review>

<text>Our first time there was for a belated Mother's Day celebration.   We messed up our reservations for 7 of us,, but they still were able to accommodate us.  Our server was Dana and she took very good care of us.  The food was outstanding.   I had the paella which had some amazing flavors.  Highly recommend them.</text>< resp>

< Review>
Our new favorite spot in town. Staff and management are AMAZING, polite, well trained, efficient and friendly. Food is great quality with great flavors (luxury Cali burrito....um yes please!). Decor and music are on point. We've eaten here 3 times this week and we have zero complaints or recommendations for improvement. This spot is all around 5 stars. Ps. The best tortilla chips we have ever eaten!!! Fresh, crunchy and not greasy tasting. Do yourself a favor and stop by this spot soon.</Review>

This restaurant experience was amazing. We were blown away by the details this new restaurant had and the ambiance that was created. The live music was perfect. Our waitress Ali was super attentive and was on top of our table whenever we needed her. The manager Kristen came over and made sure our meal was up to standard and was super helpful in making the meal special. We even got a personal visit from the owner Darrin to ensure we were doing well. Food was hot, tasty and timely. Would recommend this to any and everyone. Well done Le Papagayo. We will be back for sure.<//text>

Fun place to do happy hour and meet up with friends! The drinks are good- ask for the whiskey sour with egg white foam, very good. The food on the other hand is okay. They don’t specialize in anything, so everything was just ok. I’ve had their mussels, fries, paella, steak and frites and their filet. The mussels is the best thing. Paella was dry and didn’t have any flavor. The file mignon was way tooo sweet. It was in a nasty sweet sauce, I had to take the steak out and scrape the sweetness off and add some sauce then it was good. Overall food wasn’t that great but the drinks and ambiance is what makes me come back.< /review>

Lunch was great. Just need to improve service as took way too long to get a second beer. 2 bar tenders and 11 people at bar they should notice an empty glass pushed forward. One of the bar tenders apologized and comped my beer which was appreciated and good biz. We frequented the original in Encinitas many and this may just be growing pains as just opened. Will go back.<//Text>

<Text>Love the atmosphere, music is great!.... But yikes the pricing. I don't expect freebies, but you're paying club prices for drinks at a neighborhood bar.

Maybe go a block in either direction and save tomorrow nights worth in drinks!< /Text>< pics>

Food was delicious as always, the sangria was crisp and refreshing in all the right ways, and our waiter was extremely personable and even had a few dad jokes up his sleeve (which I admittedly loved). It was perfect for a Sunday lunch sitting outside at the open air bar seating. COVID restrictions were enforced, and we felt very safe eating away from other patrons despite it being very crowded due to the amount of space they have to work with. We were lucky and got seated right away since there were only 2 of us, but larger groups had to wait for 20-30 mins.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I've gone for a birthday dinner event, enjoyed the pozole followed by the Roasted Hawaiian Kahlua Pork,  I recommend both of them. I cannot lie about their breakfast either! The fresh orange juice and the loco moco, I'm not the kind who finishes their food, there was no way I had food to go. I have not been disappointed by any of Le Papagayo's mouthwatering delicious food. I am looking forward to enjoy their bottomless mimosas soon!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Very expensive almost as expensive as vigallucci's but the beef stroganoff was very good( not as good as the stroganoff that we had on my submarine when I was in the Nav) y but it was about 28 bucks for the stroganoff it was very good and well worth the money the draft beer was good service was very good and they had live acoustic guitar music so I would say it's way better than Vigallucci's screw V igallucci's< /text>

High hopes for another location and service like the Encinitas Le Papagayo, but we were disappointed!  40 minute wait on a Sunday,  pretty normal, but the serving sizes were sub par.  Pancakes were super thin and small for the price. My husband ordered the breakfast empanadas and they were mostly cornmeal with not much filling, and only served with a tiny bowl of beans. Service was very slow.</text>

<Text>Beautifully redone interior. Had the chicken fried steak with hashbrowns and over-easy eggs. The chicken fried steak was 6/10 for quality of  ingredients but was cooked well, so I couldn't complain. Eggs were great, and the hashbrowns were cooked with scallions (big fan). Overall it's a good place for brunch, ao I'll be back to update my review for their lunch and dinner menus.< /Text>< Pictures>

My boyfriend and I came in tonight and first, he ordered a lemonade and probably waited about 15-20 minutes to come, he ordered the pork, the rice it came with wasn’t fully cooked and the pork tasted like it had been pre-frozen and not fresh. Although I did get the pear and brie flatbread and it was good,</review>

<Text>Extremely disorganized and easily overwhelmed. I made a reservation for two, after waiting almost 30 minutes I called on a waitress only to be told they were busy that nice. Umm, hello, then dont overbook. We walked out after that. I don’t recommend as they don’t honor their reservations and have poor service.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>1<//rating>< Time>

1st time experience for breakfast and it was exceptional. Food and prices were very reasonable and the service was excellent.

We are locals, dine throughout the village regularly and would highly recommend.<//review>

<text>Don’t bother ordering food here unless you’re going to dine in. I’ve been here 3 times with my mother for takeout and easily waited no less than half an hour in the drive thru every time. After about 25 minutes of waiting behind a car the cashier casually conversed with as if there wasn’t a line of 5 cars waiting, we received our order, soggy and sad. To make it worse, these orders we waited for were items we ordered on call 20 minutes prior to arriving, give or take.<//text><userid>101511136787093930886<//userid>< Response>

(Translated by Google) And I went there just once, that's why I liked it for its good food, I had not eaten some meatballs for a long time and they prepare them delicious there but there are all my companions they declared some seafood they said it was a delight even though it was the first time I lived in Madera we went to parlier there we ate to those who have not visited yet I recommend them we are going to continue visiting this Mexican restaurant conchitas.

<Name>Joshua Warner< /Name><time>1621604398577< /time><rate>5<//rate><review>A fun shopping mall. Has an 85° which in itself gives a reason to go. Plus there is another Taiwanese place that sells street food. Great food restaurants, I also used the bathroom which was very clean.  I want to go again and get more food from all the places and check out the clothing stores. This will be a go-to place each time I visit San Francisco.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

AT&T Store Manager Anastasia made the long arduous commute bearable.
Great customer focus from the Sales consultants. I attribute this to GREAT managerial communication.
KUDOS to them!</review>

Great mall to take the family to on a cold and rainy day.... However, beware that certain stores (i.e. Target) is not connected to the main mall so you'll have to walk outside to get to one another.  The mall underwent an extensive renovation a few years ago, and is much more modern and welcoming now, with new stores, cafes and even an Apple retail store now.</text>

My eyes glazed over and I could feel a wide, cheesy grin spread across my face like warm love.  I was instantly in what I believe was a consumerism-induced catatonic state.  The colors, the newness! Ooh! ooh!  There's Bloomingdale's!  Everything was new and bright and shiny, shiny, shiny!< /Review>

I love the fact that they are opening Kura Sushi very soon where the Banana Republic used to be and I can't wait to watch a movie (when everyone is hopefully vaccinated 100%) in their new theater and grab a sandwich or two from the newly opened Whole Foods Store.<//review>< Rate>

Enclosed mall filled with fast fashion clothing and fast food outlets -  infamous for rapid depletion of non renewable resources, high greenhouse gas emissions, and the consumption of massive amounts of water and energy. Often inundated with students from SFSU and nearby middle and high schools. Large multiplex theater under construction at north end should open after Covid restrictions are lifted. Plenty of parking; located on SFMTA bus (28) and light rail lines (M).<//Text>

<text>I went to the AT&T store in the mall to help my deaf friend get some clarity on some strange charges and to get his own account. WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!!  I got conflicting information from the store staff and the 1-800 number.  No wonder I left AT&T for Creedo</text></record></dataset><record>

I first wanna start off with saying that this Mall has been a Mall that I've been going to my whole life with my family. It's always been a good experience but the last time I was there it really left me in awe and I won't be returning. I don't know what hiring process management makes security go through but it definitely isn't professional. I was at this mall around 7:30PM on the 22nd with my father who's a senior and with 2 kids and my 7 year old son who's autistic. We were getting ready to head out until my son went upstairs so We followed him up to take the other escaltor since it was closer to our car and an African American security guard started screaming at us from downstairs and followed us up & got extremely close to us, way closer than 6ft and came at us in an extremely hostile, angry & intimidating manner as if we did something wrong? Not only did he use vulgar language in front of my kids but he used intimidation tactics and appeared like he was ready to lay hands on my father. Not only was this behavior incredibly inappropriate to do to a family but I believe this man already had an issue with us beforehand because we weren't the only ones upstairs trying to make our way out but he indeed TARGETED us! This entire experience was incredibly traumatizing not only for me but for my kids and especially my son who had a meltdown because of this man following us around & being all up in our faces. Security guards aren't put in malls to police people or to cause fear on people! they're there to secure the safety and this man wasn't securing any safety! if anything he was making US feel extremely UNSAFE. I will be following up with this and will be writing other reviews on every other page I can. I am incredibly disappointed in Stones town for employing people like this. People like this with no social skills or customer service manners should not be employed at shopping centers. The mall isn't the street or the "hood" it's a shopping center where people come to have a good time and shop.<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><text>Stonestown has come a long way from when it was an open air mall. It is now fully enclosed and fill with exciting new stores on two levels and is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours shopping or window shopping. One of the new additions to the Food Court on the second level is Ike's where sandwiches rule. Order a celebrity sandwich or made your own from all the fixings you desire. I ordered the Matt Cain on sourdough and added everything that was not charged as an extra. It was good and cut in half to share with your special friend. Unfortunately another flag store Nordstrom is shuttered for good.

Good mixture of retail and eateries. It has a great variety of different eateries from pizza to pancakes from a Japanese originated franchise. Given the downturn in mall retail, the increase in eateries and other alternatives is a great way to attract visitors.< /Text>

Parking isn't the best, but I really enjoy Starbucks here.  Jasmine will remember your name on your second or third time coming in and Christian is always friendly and will go the extra mile for you. As someone who works in customer service, I really appreciate their efforts and kindness.</text>

<review>This is a nice place for shopping, food, drinks, etc.  It is easily accessible by public transportation with bus stops right outside.  If you drive, there are plenty of indoor and outside parking spaces available.

You can find a lot of shops here such as Apple Store, Target, Trader Joe, H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, Victoria's Secret, among a total of 100+ stores.

There is also a good selection of restaurants and specialty food stores for lunch and dinner, ranging from McDonald's to Olive Garden.  Now there is a huge selection of drinks to go from coffee, latte, frappuccino, milk teas, and many Asian specialty drinks which will take you many visits to try all of them.<//review>< pics>

It's fine, it's a mall. If you like malls, you'll like Stonestown. It's nice that they have a Target and a Trader Joe's.<//review>

The mall is well-ventilated. It has a lot of good store selections and the brands are almost complete. I also love exploring the restaurants here.</Text>

<Text>Very beautiful place indeed. I was in a coma for over 5 months and recently woke up. I was very hungry so I came to my favorite mall to grub. On my way there I was harassed by other people in the area and they were saying such peculiar things as “put a mask on” and “stay at home”. It was very mean but as I arrived it seemed as though there weren’t as much people around and business seemed slow. Nonetheless I walked in and went to my very favorite place, Panda Express. I assumed I came too early yet I was hungry so I couldn’t help myself but eat. A security guard found me rummaging through the supplies and I was arrested on the spot! Some people!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Stonestown Galleria is a good mid-size shopping mall with a fairly good public transport access via the M-Tram and several bus lines. There is a movie theater, several sit-down and fast food restaurants and a good variety of retail outlets. It's good to have mid-sized Trader Joe's Market here too.</review>

<Review>Lots of chain stores, a few local ones as well. Indoors, feels spacious and open. A little hard to find your way around though there are a few maps posted. Groceries, banks, shoes, clothes, jewelry, cafes; lmost anything you need or want, you could spend your whole day here. Plenty of outdoor parking as well as a parking structure.< /Review>< Pictures>

My older sister and I get all our Note 9 gear at Stonestown ATT store. The food court caters to those who like Asian food and I'm so happy about that. I am looking forward to the holiday decorations. Stonestown is like our "town center" in this area of San Francisco.< /Review>

<Review>This place has some nice shops for kids and adults. The layout of the mall is very straightforward and there are maps everywhere if you are looking for something particular. The food options at this mall are better than most, as they have a few actual restaurants.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808f7dba4ee0ce43:0xfd79b6f3fdc04aeb<//Gmap_id></record>

Getting in and out of the parking lot is a real problem.  As of November 2019, there's no more anchor stores. There's lots of construction, I'm certain that will continue for the next year or two.  It's worthy of a 2.5 star rating. Some stores are only accessible on the outside perimeter.< /text>

It’s conveniently located, has an Apple Store, a Victoria’s Secret, an 85 degree bakery, and an Aveda. It would be nice if this mall had a Macy’s again or a JC Penney or something as there’s a lot of empty space on both ends. I wish the movie theatre was connected to the mall as well instead of behind it. Overall I like this mall. It’s small and cute.<//review>

<text>There is a store for I think almost everyone here. It has changed throughout the years. More modern and upscale. Alot to see here! Very nice place to eat and shop!! I loved it!! There's a pizza place that actually does it all before your eyes as you wait. The PLUS in this is, the pizza is also on the healthier side with healthier crust and topping and it looks and smells soooooo good!!</text><user_id>106627898153836456785</user_id>< Response>

I've only lived in SF for 7 years and use to love shopping at this mall. Not anymore. Losing 2 major anchor stores while vendors seated in front of the main entrance hawking their goods. Sad what it has become. I've witnessed car windows smashed and broken into during the day by bold thieves. Mall security sure has its handful. I've had recent experience just walking outside the mall getting hassled by mentally ill or sketchy individuals who are not here to shop but loiter or harass people. I hope management looks into this and makes improvements. It has lost its positive vibe and no longer enjoyable. Too bad Stanford Shopping center is so far away...< /Text>

I went to the massage area within the mall. I paid for a 30 minute massage. It was worth every dollar l spent. What a great stress and pain relief from the massage. I felt brand new when l left the mall. It was crowded but l didn't wait long the service was great. I will be returning for another great massage.</Text>

<Review>Lots of food options and cute stores. If I'm here, I'll frequent Miniso or Uniqlo. The food court has lots of options and the ceiling art makes you feel like you're at the Vegas Venetian. Seating area is good for groups or families. They've got pizza, Taiwanese, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese food. Parking is $Free.99!!< /Review>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><review>The Mall offers some very interesting selection of foods, goods and services to nearby students and locals. For example, just for food alone, you get from Mexican to Japanese to Chinese to American, from sushi to ramen to pizza to coffee to burrito to chocolate, just to name a few. The Mall isn't all that large in terms of square footage, but it does offer a fairly good selection of shops to choose from.</review></record></dataset><record>

It's a mall. It's busy on the best days. Add the holidays into the mix and the experience is like that of going to the DMV. The parking was designed for 1950's or 60's traffic so modern traffic puts it into gridlock during even slow hours. But it occasionally has things we need. It's good in a pinch. But stay away if you value your sanity or low anxiety.<//review>

Man this was one of the most authentic Udon you can ever have in America. For couple bucks you can enjoy handmade Udon noddles with the toppings you want, and unlimited free tempura cracks and green onions to be put on top of your noodles. Their other sides was also delicious that you can pick by yourself at a decent price. The only problem is there was a long line wait here all the time, so keep your patience up!</review>

This place has basically become an Asian food mall. I don't mean it as a good or bad thing. That's just what it is. About 20 different variations of Asian food you can get here. Including at least 4 boba tea places.

There are a handful of non asian food places like Boudins, Blaze, sbarro, philly cheestake, ikes, and of course Olive garden and Chipotle.

I really like the Honey Smoothie place and Blaze pizza is always nice . However if you're not in the mood for sandwiches, pizza, or Asian food you're choices are limited. There are a few new places opening that seem to also be focused on Asian food. There will be a whole foods and movie theater soon as well.

Very disappointed in the amount if electric car parking. In the entire mall there are 6 that work and I belive there are 2 more in the back that have yet to be activated. In a mall with probably 1500 spots that brings the total to less than 10 EV spots.

Anyway, this mall in convenient for the most part and you can do most of your errands in one place.</Text>

< Review>
Overall this mall/shopping center is very nice. Unfortunately, they have lost a couple of  department stores, like Macy's and now Nordstrom. They continue to have respectable employees and a variety of stores and shops. I just wonder how long things will last with the loss of the popular and classic department stores that customers seem to frequent the most??? It is an extremely convenient and appreciated advantage in having Trader Joe's and Target in a location that is separate from the actual "mall" itself. I also enjoy  the variety of types of restaurants that are there, anything from fast-food, like McDonald's,  a wide variety of ethnic food places, anything from Olive Garden to a couple different sushi spots and there is even a "kiosk bakery" to pickup hot, fresh, classic San Francisco sourdough bread!!!  The location of Stonestown Galleria and it's other shopping centers with all of the stores and restaurants to choose from is somewhat of a distance from the same type of places that are located downtown at Westfield Mall and not too far from  Colma with it's extremely vast variety of shopping centers, with countless shops, department and grocery stores, restaurants and just about anything else that one may possibly want or need.</Review>

I had been shopping at Stonestown  gallery for many years. I loved Emporium. We lost Emporium then gained  Macy's. That was a bit difficult at first. I then became a big fan of Macy's. Unfortunately Macy's has closed their store in Stonestown. I realize change is good but I can't see the good yet< /Review>

<text>Love Stonestown!  I live just a few blocks from here. Walking distance from my flat. I'm here just about ever single day for the last 8 years.. 5 laps around the mall then lunch and coffee to relax. I'll stroll and look for a shirt or two or whatever else afterwards. Great that this place is a few blocks from my house. I'll walk there rain or shine.<//text>< Response>

Fun place! The kids especially loved the double decker, Trader Joe's where the carts have their own elevator, lol. Oh, and the pizza from Blaze. It's a super busy mall but they must be used to it because our transactions all went smoothly.</text>

I have started to enjoy Stonestown again. They have gotten some nice new shops. The Cream in the atrium is great and the See's is always my favorite. It is a great place to go to find stuff and not leave San Francisco because it has great shops and free parking. When you're done you can easily go chill at the zoo, beach, or lake Merced.< /Review>

My wife is a Harry Potter fan and there is a Harry Potter shop there which we spent an eternity browsing. There is a neat collectibles store, many places for T-shirts, caps, and so on and on.< /review>

Great shopping mall full of stores that millennials love. The most notable stops are the chains from overseas. There's plenty of parking if you drive past the parking garage. Not sure if there's AC but it was very muggy when we were there< /Text>

This is a bustling little Community here. There's plenty of parking and it's free. Has plenty of stuff to eat here like McDonald's and Starbucks. It's lots and lots and lots of shopping choices. From close to trinkets. I found this place very entertaining. I didn't see any kind of crime or Thug Enos at all. Very upscale. I would definitely be going back< /Review>

It’s a really good place to buy some clothes and shoes, although they seldom on sale, but the quality of their things are really nice. There are also Target, Trader Joe’s , and chase bank around this shopping mall. Very convenient.</review>

This is always upscale compared to other local malls like Serramonte and Tanforan, but I'm looking forward to the remodel since they got rid of Macy's and Nordstrom.</Text>

<Review>I actually didn't go inside the mall I went to Olive Garden very nice people clean restaurant. Willing to help you the only thing they weren't busy so the girls are around each other talking getting their plan together for that night Patriots that were coming in to eat. I called my order in and made it has some of the stuff that I wanted which didn't make any sense because it was in the middle of the day right after lunch. I am disabled and the girl brought me over my food so I can pay for it and go on about my way she was a really sweet girl polite uniform was up to par. But I do really think this place can go for an update spruce up.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>3<//rating><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>108993429348823120986</userid>< gmap_id>

Parking lot and drive ways are hazardous, food court needs a face lift and additional stores. Stonestown needs a better mix of apparel, electronic, sports and other popular retailers. The properties lay out should be engineered for a better flow that's easy for both foot and auto traffic.</Text>

Its a great place to go to as there is many things to do. Just like any mall you got the food court and clothes/shoes section. Also Gamestop is there and Swarovski jewelry place. Also they have dippin dots for like $5 and an indoor playground for the kids. Yup its packed in there and the whole mall especially on weekends. Overall great place 10/10<//Review>

I've never seen a Nordstrom with that little inventory. Not for the lack of space, but lack of product. Seems like people only come here to eat.  They should just turn the whole place into a food court.< /text>< Pics>

Nearly every foot is taken up by something you'll find in much larger malls. This place is very popular and has heavy foot traffic due to its proximity to several schools and transit systems. There's a movie theater in the back, but has limited showing and rather poorly maintain.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I’ve been going to this mall since I was a baby, but it’s improved since my high school days by introducing many brands that Asian people love! For example, there are now 2 or 3 boba tea places that have lines out the door, a very popular udon restaurant, and most recently, a very popular pancake place from Japan!<//Review>

<name>Robert Dolores<//name><Rating>3< /Rating><review>The highlights of this mall are the big name chain  restaurants in front..both very good..one is a slow sit down or a comfortable quick meal with your choice of drinks..personally like the mudslide both alcoholic & non alcoholic versions.
The other is a relatively fast food "Mexican style" restaurant.  Inside the big draw is the Apple store. The closest & biggest out side of downtown SF.  Otherwise it's a mall.</review></record></dataset><record>

Ugh this place is so special to me. It's the traditional mall experience but not as crowded as Westfield. With all the convenient retailers. H&M, Target, and an apple store. There is a did court that's always bustling with people, and a my movie theater.<//Text>

Cool place to grab a bite, watch a movie and get some shopping done. The parking and neighboring areas can have some traffic delays so plan accordingly. I recommend coming to see the Holiday Tree lighting .</Review>

<text>This was my second time at the Stonestown Galleria. I love all the stores they have to offer. I think the food Court could have better restaurants but my main purpose is to shop so it's really not a big deal. They have a ton of parking but it's usually really crowded.< /text>< Pictures>

Nicely maintained mall. A joy to visit and shop. Nordstroms just close, so one end is a little lonely.< /review>

The Apple and Microsoft store are very accessible. Food selections are diverse. And decorations are set up very nicely during special holiday seasons. Lots of couples and families come around here. A fair amount of young students come here too.<//Text>

Stonestown is a good local mall for students and people live nearby. It's got good food options and things that are essentials. For example, apple store and phone repair store, cellular companies, and department stores. I can't give it a five start because there's no good discount here. If you want to save money, go to somewhere else like outlets or look for online deals!< /Review>

Lots of stores and plenty of great eating options. The best part is the M goes right there. The parking lot is huge and plenty of space. Tone of public transport options and the university is right next door. They've their free WiFi which is annoying in reality as it asked  for email address and then you get spammed. I like that there is trader Joe's there, and Target is right next door although not as big and limited options compare to the bigger one.</review>

<Review>This place has come a long way in a few years. There's now multiple places to eat there's more stores bigger stores more selection. Victoria's Secrets has expanded  their footprint. There's a new pizza place there's a new burger place. The only bad thing Macy's is closing and will be replaced by some other store hopefully.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Keep shopping local there in support of your city community mall. I wonder if it will have a farmer's market there or a public market? Since Macy's is closing and what will be next there to go or shop or of  a entertainment complex to hang out and go to? Still it's not like it used to be any more of back in the days. Needs a new movie theater and events center or city services and festivals and new affordable housing and were it can be a place to go these days again.< /Review>

They've chased out all the good stores except Trader Joe's and Target. I don't have much reason to shop there anymore. I used to be in there a couple of times a month. Now I can't remember the last time I was inside that mall.< /text>

<time>1560682557777< /time><Review>I used to go to Lowell HS so I would frequent the Stonestown Mall frequently. But after graduating and moving to San Mateo, I had not gone back to that mall in many many years. When I had gone back a few months ago, it had changed a lot! Gone were Tower Records, Good Guys and even Macy's. For the retail stores here, I mainly go for the Apple Store and Express. It feels like this mall is more of a foodie destination than for retail stores as they have a great selection at the food court and outside. My favorites are Shihlin Taiwan Snacks, Marugame udon and the 85 Degrees bakery. Parking on the 19th avenue side can be tough so I go to the backside parking lot which is a little better and has less traffic congestion.<//Review><Rating>3<//Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><userid>102497188572372613466</userid><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

Stonestown has gone downscale.  Now that Macy's has closed and Nordstrom is also out, the mall is desperate to find paying tenants, including too many tacky stalls cluttering the hallways outside the stores.  There is a giant blinding, flashing video screen sign, which pays rent, hanging over the center of the mall and many more tacky advertisements hanging from the ceilings.  And there are over four different vendors hawking pricey boba teas and slushies.  The tables and floors in the upstairs food court are not cleaned often at all.  There are spills and food scraps on the tables and floors that go unattended for long periods of time.  Many store employees seem unhappy and don't bother to greet customers.  This is not a comfortable place to shop.</Review>

This mall is forever changing search Come and Go all the time so it's really hard to keep up. Is the come here all the time after school well growing up every time I come here since I a good circus in and figure store open up are you smell this mall from the back of my head and I can close my eyes and tell you where everything is but it's still okay but the food could be better and that could have a lot more better stories.<//review>

This place is nice, I go to school next door at SF state. So I’m here often, I think it’s a great mall, the food court is nice, and so are the stores, and the parking lot is huge, what more do you need!<//Text>

Traffic is a mother... Yeah. The basics in terms of mall offerings, with some nice extras like Trader Joe's. It's a great pit stop for those at SFSU. If you're visiting the bay area, though, maybe choose a mall outside of SF with less traffic.< /text>

It's closer to Lowell so if we are early we still by here and pick up our favorite foods from trader Joe and some snacks from shihlin. Send like it's getting a good collection of Asian chains here, so worth a visit for that<//Review>

It's a mall. A lot of people don't enjoy malls, but I do. And I especially enjoy Stonestown because of the wide array of people you get to people watch. The teenagers who come after school. The older generation who don't handle huge malls well. The people who rush in and rush out just as quickly. The many different shops available. This mall provides so much.<//Review>

<Review>A little grey on the outside, but the mall itself is actually quite nice - spacious and clean, with probably all the shops you'd expect in a shopping mall. I do think Westfield in Downtown has a better selection of stores, but Stonestown absolutely does its job.

Food options are alright, there's also a Trader Joe's on the same lot, as well as a couple of restaurants.<//Review>< userid>

<Review>St. Columba is a vibrant community and charming retreat space. I have been on several day retreats and one three night stay. On my three night stay, I hiked Mt. Vision right behind the retreat house. It's 2.5 miles uphill but the views from top are spectacular! It is very welcoming to all identities and faiths. The current pastor and his partner are amazing guys. If you get to meet them (and he's not running around holding things together) defintely stop and have a conversation with him. He is very intelligent and aware.<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating><gmapID>0x808f7dba4ee0ce43:0xfd79b6f3fdc04aeb</gmapID>< Date>

<date>1560682557777< /date><Rating>3< /Rating><review>I used to go to Lowell HS so I would frequent the Stonestown Mall frequently. But after graduating and moving to San Mateo, I had not gone back to that mall in many many years. When I had gone back a few months ago, it had changed a lot! Gone were Tower Records, Good Guys and even Macy's. For the retail stores here, I mainly go for the Apple Store and Express. It feels like this mall is more of a foodie destination than for retail stores as they have a great selection at the food court and outside. My favorites are Shihlin Taiwan Snacks, Marugame udon and the 85 Degrees bakery. Parking on the 19th avenue side can be tough so I go to the backside parking lot which is a little better and has less traffic congestion.<//review>< Pics>

I honestly love this place. Best teas, bobba, food...music. Cute gifts to get for friends...parking is a bit on the hassle but not to complex.<//review>

I like that the parking lot is never full at this mall. They've also added a few new stores. Even though the mall is only two floors it's not a bad place to shop.

On Sundays you'd find a farmer's market behind Macy's parking lot.</review>

St. Columba is a vibrant community and charming retreat space. I have been on several day retreats and one three night stay. On my three night stay, I hiked Mt. Vision right behind the retreat house. It's 2.5 miles uphill but the views from top are spectacular! It is very welcoming to all identities and faiths. The current pastor and his partner are amazing guys. If you get to meet them (and he's not running around holding things together) defintely stop and have a conversation with him. He is very intelligent and aware.<//review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>It's a pretty good place to shop or even just to unwind. It has good retail stores (for fashion, not so much with electronics though). Most of the stores I visit also have reasonable discounts quite often. There aren't a whole lot of food selections, but they're mostly decent. There's complimentary WiFi too.</review><gmap_id>0x808f7dba4ee0ce43:0xfd79b6f3fdc04aeb</gmap_id>< Response>

Traffic is a mother... Yeah. The basics in terms of mall offerings, with some nice extras like Trader Joe's. It's a great pit stop for those at SFSU. If you're visiting the bay area, though, maybe choose a mall outside of SF with less traffic.< /review>

Stonestown is good but there isn't a very good selection of stores. There are plenty of restaurants but I don't think there are enough clothing stores.  Other than that, Stonestown is very clean and it makes for a pleasant shopping experience.</text>

The most interesting thing about this place, as of Q3 2016: There's a restaurant in the food court called Silk Road, and everyone there appears to be Central Asian. The owner is apparently Kyrgyz. Definitely an unexpected food adventure.</text>

This a great shopping centre, its a real shame to see the Macy's store lose its buzz. The store looks sad and tired and from our last visit 7 years ago we never brought anything this time, really sad. Nordstrom looked great though.< /review>

One of my favorite places to shop. They have a nice food court... they also have a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice. There is also an Olive Garden restaurant on the outside and there are some bakeries and pizza places to name a few. There is an Apple Store for your tech needs. There's a Nordstrom and a Macy's store and one of my favorites.... J.Jill. there is a See's Candies on the lower level and an AT&T shop on the upper level. A few hair salons too. The place is beautifully decorated around the holidays. All-in-all, a very nice place to go. :-)<//Text>

This mall is great because it is not super huge, and comfortable enough to just stroll around. It isnt super crowded either which is great! Needs more stores though.<//Text>

It's a mall. Not really a huge fan anyway, but it doesn't really have any stores for me. H and M has only women's clothes. Food court boring. If malls are your thing though, it's a fairly good sized place.</text>

A suburban type of mall within San Francisco (but just barely!) Lots of parking, plenty of food choices, teenagers galore, etc. You can even charge up your electric car in the underground garage.</review>

If you're sick of shopping in the city, the Stonestown Galleria provides a suburban mall atmosphere. It's convenient to public transportation, has a food court with popular restaurants, and free parking. There is a Trader Joe's. All of the stores that you expect to be in a mall are there; Victoria's Secret, Pink, Apple Store, Nordstrom, all of the typical mall shops are there.

There are signs which also promise that a Target is coming soon; that'll be a great addition to the mall.<//review>

Small, but not a bad mall.
Parking can be difficult.

Food court upstairs, main entrance's elevator to the 2nd floor is out.

Quite a few new restaurants.

Scavenger hunt: Find three fire hydrants in the mall.<//text>

Typical mall with a food court. The big stores are Macy's and Nordstrom.  There is a store or kiosk for pretty much anything from greeting cards to calendars.  Parking can be tight in the outside lots, but there's usually a lot of spaces in the parking structure in the back.< /review>

Here's a short anecdote that conveys amazing an customer experience from the staff at this gamestop:

I had been calling in for two weeks to if they have any Nintendo Switches, which at this point are very difficult to come by.  They didn't, but said if I try coming in-store they might have them on this particular night.  So I went and no luck.  But the staff person and manager went off for a second to discuss together, and decided that they would unload the UPS package that had come in a half hour earlier, just so I could get my Switch.  They had planned on unloading it the following morning, but fast-tracked the process to accommodate me.

Super cool move.  Speaks to the friendly nature of the people at this Gamestop.  Good service is good business.</text>

Stonestown is a nice mall. They have your standard stores and food court options. However, it also has some solid fast casual food options like Blaze Pizza, Built Burgers, Chipotle, and CREAM.<//Review>

<review>It's a very "mally" mall with that late 90s galleria look you may be familiar with.

The second largest mall in San Francisco (after the Westfield Mall). Nordstrom's and Apple are the leaders here now. There has been a large turnover in recent years, many new stores (Zara among them) and more are coming this year.  There are some stores and eateries for younger population from the nearby State University, which is great. Trader Joe's is a very convenient recent addition. There are also several bakeries, some old fashioned candy stores, a food court, and the Boudin Sourdough Cafe. There is lots of parking space and public transportation close by.</text>

< Review>
Usually, say 9 times out of 10, the service @ Stonestown is faster than other ops. Occasionally, you might find yourself waiting for a sales rep to wrap up his/her table talk with another employee. This was the case @ Nordstrom this past weekend. I walked away & actually found exactly what I was looking for at Clark's. In & out in 15!< /Review>

The Olive Garden is Fantastic and Friendly.
The Service was excellent, the price good.
The Staff are entertaining as 4 of them song "Happy Birthday" to I-N-I🎂🎂🎂.
I recommend you to Visit The Olive Garden.
And they do have Vegetarian Dish. YAH'S LOVE. SHAKLA.</Text>

Pretty neat mall, has food, an apple store, Macy's and Nordstrom's. Ton's of shops I think they are around 125 shops now. There is a  Uniqlo here, they hem their pants for free. Many hours of my youth spend here hanging with friends. It's been updated on the inside a bunch but what's up with that old and decrepit Macy's sign on the exterior?<//text>

Stonestown Galleria is a modern shopping center with a diverse selection of stores and eatery in the food court.  I go there primarily for Trader Joes and Target.  Located off 19th Avenue, it is near freeway access.  It is served by several Muni bus lines including the 18, 28, 29, and M streetcar.  SamTrans also stop on 19th Avenue.  There is ample parking.  SF State is a short stroll away.< /text>

A good little shopping center, but it can be tricky to get in and out of. I take the back entrances to both sides of the complex to avoid traffic and pedestrians. There is a wide variety of stores, and really yummy places to eat. Avoid the Regis Salon like the plague, though.</review>

This is a pretty nice mall with a good selection of shops and eateries.  There's a small theater located in the back, right behind the mall.  SFSU, the local library, and a Muni station are all within walking distance.< /Review>

I needed more Clinique make-up so I dropped in to Nordies... not exactly in and out but I conquered my goal! I like the fact that they had a big parking lot and I could also look for something I needed at Targert and purchase some Trafer Joes ready-to-eat salads. Off on my next errand!</Text>

I highly recommend this mall. I prefer is over the Westfield mall because it has more affordable stores & tons of free parking! You won't have any street people druggie harassing you & your fam. It is a family friendly area. Lots of restaurants at this location. 2 gyms walking distance as well. This place isn't pet friendly.< /Text>

< Review>
Look, this store is by a mall and it's run by college/high school age kids. I get that it's not going to be the greatest Target. But I was there yesterday 4/26 for Keurig Descaler, none in stock, which is not that big of a deal. An associate informed me that they will be in stock 4/27. Today I call the store for more than 30 minutes with no answer. Walk 20 minutes only to find out it's actually not in stock. Guess I'm buying it on Amazon where not only is it cheaper, I won't be given the run around or incorrect information. Just overall not impressed!< /Review>

It is a mall. Nothing special, but it attracts a wide range of people every day. Two issues that must be addressed are them not turning the escalators on early in the morning,  and the WiFi there is a sick joke. Otherwise,  it is a basic shopping mall with many different stores.<//text>

It's okay. Don't expect to do any serious shopping. Place is really just a place for students to go eat lunch or pick up a Starbucks coffee. There lots old people around. Not sure where they come from.<//review>

It's a mall with all the standard mall spots - Macy's, Victoria Secret, Sephora, Uniqlo, Van's, Lush, Forever 21, Nordstrom, etc. BUT BONUS: it has a Trader Joe's. The mini Target is a major disappointment (selection is terrible). There are quite a bit of dining options beyond the food court, including an Olive Garden that gave my husband food poisoning, and various other trendy eateries that often fail and turn into different trendy eateries. There is a farmers market on Sunday between 9 am and 1 pm. Don't fight for above ground parking - the garage parking is both ample and very close to the mall entrance, plus it saves you a butt searing during the occasional hot SF day (anything over 75°).</review>

Nice place to hang out.  I took my daughter as she loves SF.  We went to Tartine on Guerrero but there simply wasn't anywhere to park without a bag of quarters.  So we ordered take out.  We ended up at Peet's Coffee in Stonestown.   We ordered a tea and a coffee and sat outside enjoying our "lunch" from Tartine.  The mall itself was nice, especially compared to what it used to be back in the early to mid 80's.  Slightly more upscale than your typical mall....  Nice blend of restaurants and shops.</review>

It has over 100 plus stores such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Foot Locker, Banana Republic, Gaps and Swarovski, etc. There's also a Trader Joe where you could do something grocery shopping at the same time. A Target is opening soon. On the weekend, Stonestown hosts the Off the Grid on Saturday and farmer's market on Sunday.< /Text>< pics>

This mall has changed a lot.  The stores are geared to teeny-boopers now.  I wish they would bring back a bookstore into the mall.</review>

This is one of my favorite malls because it's low key with a lot of parking including multiple parking garages. The mall is never annoyingly packed and they have great stores like H&M, Victorias Secret, Nordstroms, Gymboree, etc.<//review>

Most of the time I start away from malls, for some reason I just feel sensory overload most of the time I go to closed off spaces.

But, this place actually feels really open and it has a very decent selection of stores.

Love cotton on, uniqlo and trader Joe's. Even found that they have a dmasq (SP?) that is pretty similar to a very small version of a bershka.<//review>

I like this mall. It's small but has underground parking for rainy and hot days.  Has shops that Serramonte seems to not have and vice versa, so they complement each other. Also nice the M line is right in front.
Used to love coming here for Chevy's happy hour when I went to SFSU.</Text>

The sellers can be more intrusive than the downtown homeless.  This year I thought they'd been tamed, but, no.  A smiling  woman from a shop filled with gold-looking things interrupted my journey to say "Hello" and talk to me about whatever she was selling. Ugh.

The stores (Nordstroms, Apple, Macy's, Brookstone, etc.) are great. But, those sleazy kiosks keep me from going to Stonestown except for an annual Christmas trip.< /text>< Response>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>This mall has been struggling for market share for a while. Stores come & go all the time. There not one thing that appeals to me to buy here, so even though it's relatively close to me, I wind up going to other malls. The only reason I go here is for a walk in inclimate weather.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>At the convergence of several bus lines (28, 28R, 29, M, and a few others I rarely if ever take, this mall is easy to get to. It also has a Nordstrom, Teavana, Boudin,  Olive garden,  sushi bar and a Giants store. There are many more stores, with something for everyone. Plenty of parking, with front and back lots, and a structure attached to Nordstrom.  There's a Trader Joe's too.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808f7dba4ee0ce43:0xfd79b6f3fdc04aeb< /gmap_id></record>

This mall has changed over the years but is right off of 19th Ave neighboring SFSU. Looks like they added a Target to the area and is constantly evolving. They have a little bit of everything for everyone.</review>

Stones is located right next to SFSU and a library. Better yet there is a dedicated M Street car station right in front! Just be careful when your crossing the street please.

Once inside, you will be graced(now) with C.R.E.A.M, the ice cream sandwich booth! And then a ghiradelli to the left and a unique collectibles store! Vast variety of stores, ranging from food to jewelry to clothing. Patrons and staff are of diverse backgrounds as well!

Just to name a few: Macy's, Nordstrom, H&M, Uniqlo, Michael Kors, Apple store, Food court, and lots more.

Stonestown evolves with us.<//Text>

The selection of stores is typical for a mall.  The two anchor stores are Nordstrom and Macy's.  The food court has a decent selection.  There is also a Boudin's on the ground floor, and a cafe at Nordstroms.  This mall can get pretty crowded, because it is located right next to SFSU.<//Review>< rate>

<review>I've always come here to shop because it's the closest mall near where I live. The shops have been updated over the years to provide more diversity in what is offered for clothing, food, and essentials. You won't find all shops here, so you should check their directory if you're not sure what you need is here.

Do check out the new ice cream shop in the middle of the mall. That's probably the most prominent location since everyone passes through here. It's pretty delicious! Food court is in the 2nd floor right above it (in the middle). You'll also find Macys on one end and Nordstrom on the other end. Parking is usually decent as there are parking lots of both sides of the mall as well as an underground lot. There is also a parking structure outside of Nordstrom as well. Some additional shops are in the next street (connected by Nordstrom), such as McDonalds, Trader Joe's, and I believe Chase bank. Sports Authority *was* there as well but they are out of business now.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Not too much variety but great for everyone. Usually many students during weekdays and after school. Has many clothing stores but not much else in terms of variety.<//review>

Not too much variety but great for everyone. Usually many students during weekdays and after school. Has many clothing stores but not much else in terms of variety.</Review>

Under this name you can find the trypical shopping mall, with all the stores you may expect. Not really far from downtown San Francisco, you can arrive also by bus!  Went there looking for the shop  Brookstone.  Had a lot of parking, shops, etc.</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Bad experience !!! We were on 05/22/17 and parked right in front of the entrance to the Olive Garden restaurant ... well lit ... a lot of movement ... we saw security guards hanging around ... and when we got back the car was with all the passenger glass broken and they had stolen several belongings ... it was a big loss ... stress ... we called security q just took note ... we went to the police station ... ended our tour !!! We were never robbed here in Brazil ... That was a lesson !!! Never leave your belongings in the car anywhere ...

Plus, it's attached to Stonestown, so the shopping town is wide, so you have a lot of choices.
